Whenever possible I avoid this situation.  Instantiate the prefab via a script, and use something like  var myprefab = Instantiate.......... That way there is no finding necessary because I get the gameobject reference as it's created.    Method 2 is my personal choice whenever possible. I like to build my scene via code and make any connections necessary to the prefab at the time it's created. This allows flexibility make changes down the line also."

And then I understood at the end :) So yeah, definetly, that's reasonable, and I made a lot of fun with animators so I can guarantee you : they are awesome. Not as awesome as AudioMixers, who changed my whole world of sounds in games, but that's pretty strong stuff.  I'm not sure, but, just in case, make yourself sure that you have the same parameters in both animators. No use of it maybe, but if you keep the same inputs you will sometimes call for a change.

Unity3D,3e1plt,Leorek,4,Tue Jul 21 07:36:47 2015 UTC,"What I'm doing for Holodance (gameplay video) is export the Midi files from the DAW (Cubase in my case) and import them in my Unity scene using the midi file implementation of NAudio. NAudio can do a lot more and it might actually also be able to get some of the information from the actual audio-file using audio-analyses - but you'll never get it as precisely as when you have the actual notes that were played.  In particular, when you have access to a midi file, you can easily distinguish the different instruments, know exactly what notes were played for how long and at what velocity. You could even go deeper and work with stuff like pitch-bend or controller data, if you really want to go wild ;-)  Of course, this only works when you either are the composer / producer of the music you're using and you are using a digital audio workstation (DAW, like Logic or Cubase), or they give you the midi files. But I think this really is the best approach because of its precision and flexibility.  For example: In the first version of the track for Level-01 (first version of Holodance Level-01 on Soundcloud), the main melody started 45 seconds into the track (and that song is only 1:30) ... which would be really boring for players that chose the melody-track. When I noticed that issue during play-testing, I added just a few notes on that track much earlier in the song - turning this specific track of the song to the most interesting one because it has a really nice climax (improved version of Holodeck Level-01 on Soundcloud).  So, if you're asking for the ""best approach"", I'd go with Midi files created directly from the DAW. Tracker files, of course, offer the same benefits - I just haven't worked with those formats and don't know if you get the level of access in Unity that you do with Midi files (when using the appropriate extensions).  The second best approach IMHO is using beat-detection: This has the huge advantage of working also when you don't have access to the midi file or when your music material is using a lot of non-synth instruments. So in those cases it's the best approach because you simply don't have a midi file. But it's by far not as precise and or flexible."
Unity3D,3e1plt,JashanChittesh,2,Tue Jul 21 13:29:17 2015 UTC,Can you be a bit more precise? What do don't you know how to do yet and what do you already have?
Unity3D,3e1plt,TwIxToR_TiTaN,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:41:29 2015 UTC,"Actually I'm using this! in order to detect where a beat is produced (I'm not pre-processing at the moment). There is a button which the player press in time with that beat and the game should be able to detect it. To achieve this I was using a variable which was set to true for some time (0.5 secs for example), to give the player the chance to be able to hit. My question is if this could be a way to do this or if I should try another."
Unity3D,3e1plt,TwIxToR_TiTaN,2,Tue Jul 21 08:18:26 2015 UTC,What went wrong with your solution?  anyway this is another way to do it: You could draw a bar across the width of the screen and when a note/falling bar thingy is inside the bar you are supposed to press the button. This way you have visual feedback + you can just check if the falling note/bar collides with bar across the width of the screen and if true add points.  Or is the problem that the bars are falling when OnBeatDetected is called and when the falling bar reaches the bottom of the screen its already to late because the beat already was audible? If this is the case you could try to add a second camera with the same track but add a delay to it and use this camera/audiosource for the OnBeatDetect.
Unity3D,3e1plt,Seinelake,2,Tue Jul 21 09:43:04 2015 UTC,"You need to save the pressing times with milliseconds to a list and then when player plays the game compare the times with the ones in list. You can find tempo for the song using a metronome or some program.  Let's say your song is 120 BPM. That's hit every 0.5 seconds so your list for something basic rhythm like (dun-dun-dun-dudu) could look something like:  0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.75  Then just have another list telling which list to use for which parts of the song."

You might want to flip some of those triangles, (ie, instead of 15,16,17 you'd have 17,16,15). I can't tell at a glance which ones are the issue.  You also seem to be duplicating vertices. This isn't your problem, but it's an optimisation issue. Pyramids should only need 5 points (the 5 you have in your initial array). Unless you're doing crazy things with UV mapping, just use that array instead of duplicating it. Each int in your triangles array doesn't need to be unique."

Unity3D,3e1rxy,Theomrs,3,Tue Jul 21 15:33:31 2015 UTC,Sounds like good practice for debugging. Break the problem down into simple parts. What happens when you use only the indices for the base of the pyramid? Is it broken? Not in the right place? Does changing the order help? Is one of the vertices not where you expect?

Unity3D,3e1rxy,TwIxToR_TiTaN,2,Tue Jul 21 13:37:37 2015 UTC,"To build on Canazza's answer, notice this line of your code:  mesh.RecalculateNormals();       Normals are used to render polygons.  It's a line perpendicular to the vertices of the polygon that says which way the polygon points, and which side will render.  If you look at that side, you will see a polygon, if you look at the back of that side, you will not see a polygon (with culling on in your shader).  You can ""fix"" this problem by turning culling off in your shader, but this will mess up your lighting, and it's wrong.    You need to arrange your triangles so normals are generated correctly by respecting Unity's winding order.

Unity3D,3e1em9,RegsStandup,3,Tue Jul 21 05:26:46 2015 UTC,"There are several things you need to keep in mind. Different resolutions and different aspect ratios are two different things. Different resolutions with the same aspect ratio should not be a problem as long as you use 'Scale with Screen Size' in the canvas scaler. The main camera will fit the same amount of content regardless of resolution, if the aspect ratio is the same.  Now the problems begin when you switch from 16:9 to 4:3 or some other combination of aspect ratios.  Here's a good article for making this work in the UI: http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/HOWTO-UIMultiResolution.html  About the main camera, keep in mind that the amount of information displayed on the vertical (y) axis is constant, but when changing aspect ratios, the amount of info on the vertical (x) axis changes, so that you see more or less to the sides depending on your aspect ratio.  So as long as you plan ahead, and check that in 4:3 resolution (or 5:4 if you want to support that) all the important data is visible, you should be fine (main camera only, UI is a different issue see link)"
Unity3D,3e1em9,tomerbarkan,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:09:27 2015 UTC,"If you're using unity's UI, then you just need to change the UI Scale Mode of the canvas to 'Scale with Screen Size' and you put in your reference resolution accordingly, the way you want."

Rotating object does not change it's velocity. What you expect from your object is consistent force addition in direction of the object heading without inertia, from what I understand, so it would be better if you manually set your object's velocity in local forward direction. Better for control, less accurate in terms of physics, closer to what you expect."

I'm always trying to do things the hard way  Someone else can check if I have a mistake and my memory is a bit fuzzy on this but to get the x, y coordinate (r = radius of your circle, x = the x position you want to put your object, y = the y position you want to put your object, cx is the x of the center of your circle, cy is the y of the center of your circle)  The formula to use:  x = cx + r * cos(theta)  y = cy + r * sin(theta)  theta is your direction in radians with 0 (zero) being in the direction of the x axis and moving counter clockwise as your angle increases.  Simply put theta in a loop that goes from 0 to 2*PI.  If you have your angle in degrees and want to use degrees, make sure you substitute theta in the formula for theta*PI/180.0  Also, I would use floats or doubles for the values.  You can clamp those to a certain accuracy if you need to."

In update () there will be a switch statement pointing different states in different classes. In their respective classes they would sit idle waiting for manager to call them at its own update(). Each state in their own class will have changestate(newState) methods.  Is this the way?  I'll fiddling with this at least.

Unity3D,3dy2p6,CrazyMinnowStudio,2,Mon Jul 20 13:58:51 2015 UTC,Congrats on the sales! And thanks for sharing the marketing insights. Is it normal for Unity to not tell the asset creators that their product is being featured?
Unity3D,3dy2p6,xWIKK,3,Mon Jul 20 15:34:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks! We had submitted the google doc request form after we were initially published, and resubmitted a few times since then. We discovered that the form was recently updated with new Unity v5 requirements so we submitted an update that contained the latest SALSA version published from Unity 4.3 and 5.0.0f1. This is so users of Unity v5.x won't receive an arbitrary, and inaccurate,  compatibility message. Our source is the same in each version, but Unity shows the message on v5 editors if the package wasn't published with v5. So now we publish from both version. I'm assuming the lack of notification was an oversight, at least I hope it was. It makes more sense for everyone if publishers have some time to pre-market the coming sale."
Unity3D,3dy2p6,leuthil,3,Mon Jul 20 16:13:28 2015 UTC,I've heard from a few publishers now that they came online to find their asset on the 24 hour sale.

I wish Unity would improve the system for applying for the 24 hour deals too - some kind of waiting list, or part of the publisher backend would be nice. Did you have to do anything other than sign up the once for it? Just filling out a Google docs survey just doesn't seem quite right!"

Here's the relevant code (Again, the 'flat' version):                          cameraController.transform.position = new Vector3 (hit.point.x, cameraController.transform.position.y,                                                            hit.point.z - (cameraController.transform.position.y * (Mathf.Tan( Vector3.Angle (cameraController.transform.forward, Vector3.down)*Mathf.Deg2Rad))));   Your method of using a focus object may be more efficient. It's certainly easier to read, lol."

You might make sure your floor size is a nice round number compatible with Unity's unit size so that you can place them at whole number positions (10, 20, etc vs 10.3456 18.2934 for example).  Your next coordinate value should be one floor distance away.  Also, make sure all your floors are the same size."

If you're in a loop you may be accumulating some bit of error as your loop proceeds.  You should be adding in exactly the size of your floor units.  Your floor units should all be the same size in the direction you are adding them on.  Look over everything and make sure you're not missing something with the sizes and values.  Perhaps when I get home (on mobile now) I might have a chance to look at your scene and code.

I guess I could make another list, with model name, and ID. Then if the gun has changed, find the same ID/Name, and select that one. But I think that will cause a stutter when there's a lot of weapons, and I don't think that that's a good idea. Or are computers powerful enough to have a foreach and check the weapon, set the weapon active and the others deactivated?"
Unity3D,3dzlfj,SpectreOfTheMachine,2,Mon Jul 20 20:45:37 2015 UTC,Have a list and a current weapon variable (GameObjects for types) disable current weapon using .setactive pull new weapon from list and set it as current weapon enable current weapon using .setactive

Unity3D,3dxxnz,ViRiX_Dreamcore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:05:26 2015 UTC,I am trying to make a ( I do not want to scare anyone ) Diablo 3 ish platformer..  I should probably say a hack and slash platformer. With somewhat infinite levels..  I made a lot of math and procedural worlds or labyrinths in my life but I'm kinda terrible as an artist. And I still wonder if I keep lowpoly/cartoon graphics or if im trying to learn realistic world a bit..
Unity3D,3dxxnz,ViRiX_Dreamcore,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:43:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd go for the simple aesthetic. As soon as I saw the first few seconds of the video, I was drawn in. Everyone's going realistic, so I'd say go for this. It'll stand out more IMO.  If it's Diablo, will the camear be at the character's back like that? Hm. Infinite number of levels.... That can be tricky based on the kind of gameplay you want. (I personally like a limited number of level with ""love"" put into each one rather than a ton of them generated from a computer."

So this island is a mesh i created in blender and I do like that artstyle too. My current goal is to make the gameplay the best and my second goal is to create a lot of ""assets"" to create worlds.  After that , I will make some worlds ( tutorials at least ) pre-generated, but I will also work in a some sort of random ( helped ) generated worlds, a bit like the rift in diablo.  The only reason i said diablo is because, there will be levels/random ""rifts"" and hack/slash .

Unity3D,3dxxnz,tymscar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:13:58 2015 UTC,"It's fine. I understood it.  Hm one suggestion is to create assets with simple mechanics that when put together, can be used in a ton of different ways.  So instead of having to think up new moves for every set of levels, maybe moves you already have effect different objects and enimies in later levels differently.  Example: A pad that makes your weapon stronger for a small amount of time. You could have another that is a bouncy pad. So if you put them next to each other, you get a stronger weapon for a small amount of time and then you bounce up to a higher location to hit something that you normally can't hit.  Add moving platforms to that, put the strength increasing pad on the moving platform... all sorts of fun to be had."

Unity3D,3dw7dz,Shablo5,9,Mon Jul 20 04:53:03 2015 UTC,"Edit: /u/urzaz beat me to it, but I'll leave this here anyway.  No problem; this is worth explaining.  First; Daggerfall is a DOS 1996 open-world 3D RPG, second of the Elder Scrolls series (therefore same universe of Oblivion and Skyrim) by Bethesda Softworks. Subjectively speaking, it is notable for its incredibly large and vast map with thousands of locations and dungeons; each populated with NPCs and monsters.  This was possible to pull off in a game just measuring 150MB, because of procedural generation. This has been used in games like Frontier: Elite 2 to dynamically generate locations using an algorithm and palettes of prefabs. The downside to this is that content such as generated quests and dungeon layouts become repetitive. If desired, the vanilla Daggerfall game is legally available for free download.  Now, Daggerfall Tools for Unity is a set of tools that allow the use of Daggerfall's assets (art, music, etc.) in Unity using Gavin's ""DaggerfallConnect API"" to parse the original content files. The intent is to allow Daggerfall's gameplay elements to be easily used in Unity games; OP's submission has examples of these, such as using Daggerfall's enemies with their original AI. Subsequently, there is the very cool side effect of having the potential to port Daggerfall itself to Unity 3D."

I'm not sure what plugins to recommend unless you have ideas for a specific effect you want to achieve at these points. I can rattle off a few suggestions if you like:  For the strike on the wall:   Perhaps the strike could light up the room for a frame? Maybe a few particle effects spawning off the wall to give the impression of sparks? What is the weapon that you will be striking with? If it's a sword, then a few sprites of a slash effect will look cool https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=sword+slash+sprites&tbm=isch A bit of screenshake always makes something cooler naturally you want to think about sound aswell. It wants to match the intensity of the visuals without being too distracting, depending on how often you expect this effect to happen   For the blackhole effect:   some kind of spinning/shrinking animation to go with the fadeout more screenshake a particle effect that sucks particles towards the center of the hole, perhaps in a spiralling fashion Play a muffled ""whoomph"" sound effect and quickly fade out all other sounds, as if the hole itself has absorbed all the sound in the game once you've fallen through it.   There's no one plugin to implement these ideas. It's really just a case of trying it yourself and seeing what works for you."

I can understand certain projects not wanting to use monobehaviours for everything due to performance reasons, but the premise of your implementation is just decoupling? Unless I'm missing something, monobehaviours at their most basic can basically be identical to yours. With just a few lines you can have well managed GameObjects that work as containers for data just like your examples, thus have no real coupling issues.  This just looks like the typical code a non-Unity programmer coming to Unity would make, where they drastically increase the complexity of their projects for little gain."

As you mentioned, all of that can be accomplished with Unity's implementation quite nicely - in fact, I was very tempted to use GameObjects and MonoBehaviours to accomplish every feature of my project.  I specifically modeled the system after Unity because I like it so much!  Some of the reasons I decided to make a native equivalent are performance and resource based (it is a bit silly to require a whole GameObject, transform etc) and Scriptable Objects feel a little incomplete to me, though I use them as well.  In addition, though I make no claim that the system is thread safe, at least it has no constraints keeping you from using it that way.  Another reason is because I WAS using GameObjects and Monobehaviours in my tutorials (such as with the StateMachine) and I kept getting feedback from people that their primary complaint was that it didn't need to be based on Monobehaviours and how wasteful Monobehaviours are.  It's hard to please everyone :)  I've been using, and loving, Unity for a long time.  I'm only starting to look for ways to ""overcomplicate"" things because I am reaching the limits of their implementation and am wanting more wiggle room."

It's well made with the bubbly letters bobbing around, it actually gives it some charm so that was a nice touch to do that. Otherwise it'd be very generic. Isn't it strange how the little details matter?  Other than that, it would probably get better if you had an artist make some cohesive art because the art is obviously pretty disjointed since you grabbed assets.  But you did a good job with the game itself, so the aesthetics can be easily dismissed for being a bit weird.  I think you can get somebody to ""reskin"" your game. Like I've seen something to that effect especially for mobile games, because let's face it, the popular mobile games are just pretty reskinned games that have been around for years.  Yeah so I think that's an actual thing that's done often (might be a sub for it or forums), and since your game is pretty much done (or at the very least you just plan to polish), I'm sure you can peddle it around to find an artist willing to reskin it for you.   They can provide like a prototype screen where they change the UI and all the art and make it come together, and you can see if you like it and then move forward with the artist.  Essentially, a game like Candy Crush is popular because it's polished. They just stole the game (the candy theme and all) from a dude with crappier art, and that's why it became popular because it's just aesthetically pleasing, and then the gameplay being addictive comes second because first impressions and all that jazz. (I know that's sad)  Even if you're not looking to make something really successful, you can totally just put in the effort to find an artist willing to reskin it for you for some kind of revenue share."

You can listen to the demo of the whole package here.  This is the initial release of the asset. It will be expanded with more clips and it will part of a more extended project called ""rock loops construction kit"", that will be sold separately.    ROCK LOOPS PACK contains 12 loops in rock style that share the same tempo and sound. You can loop a single clip or you can try to connect the different clips one after the other to crate more complex soundtrack, even following your gameplay. You will also find a selection of 3 intros in this pack and 5 different ends for the loops. You can listen to the demo of the whole package here.    Both of these packs are part of a project still in development named ROCK CONSTRUCTION KIT  it will include:  - seamless loop in rock style. All in the same tempo and sound/mix  - intro clips  - end clips  you will be able to:  - use any intro clip to start any loop  - use any end clip to end any loop  - connect together different loops  - use intro clips to connect different loops  - use end clips as standalone stinger for win/lose events in the game  I made a first video demo in which I show how these concepts are applied to the clips.

Unity3D,3dwnsh,jasoncoan,6,Mon Jul 20 03:49:33 2015 UTC,"I believe all the cogs and wheels of the engine when you build your Unity game gives you a minimum of 12 megs (you can try this if you just build an empty project with nothing in it but an empty scene).  If you don't optimize size I think it goes up to 22 megs. (22 + 8 = 30~) Sounds like what you have.  You can look at the Unity manual and look up mobile size optimization to reduce it further, but I think the minimum you can do is 12 megs EXCLUDING your actual project assets, so 12 megs + whatever you have at the least."

Unity3D,3duwtk,fuzzywobs,7,Sun Jul 19 19:50:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting the solution. I have some issues like that myself.  When you say it was because of the models scale, do you mean the scale of the gameobject, or the scale of the prefab? (or the scale of the model in your 3D modelling application!)"
Unity3D,3duwtk,uzimonkey,3,Sun Jul 19 22:57:05 2015 UTC,It was the gameobject that was upscaled I think. The model might have been too small as well but it solved itself when I scaled down the gameobject.
Unity3D,3duwtk,drizztmainsword,2,Sun Jul 19 23:39:36 2015 UTC,"Even with that scale, you should be able to tweak the bias and distance settings.  However, a lot of things in Unity only work right at certain scales.  Having very large scales can break shadows and some shaders, having very small scales breaks mesh colliders, etc."
Unity3D,3duwtk,uzimonkey,2,Mon Jul 20 00:56:00 2015 UTC,"You likely know this, but for a random lurker who doesn't know: a unity unit is equivalent to a meter. They recommend that assets be sized appropriately. This helps shadows and physics work properly."
Unity3D,3duwtk,bitgus,4,Mon Jul 20 01:03:50 2015 UTC,"Right, but at the same time you can't just scale everything to real world.  If you're modeling an entire planet, I wouldn't make it 20,000 units wide.  Or conversely if you're doing a minigolf game, a golf all that's 0.04 units wide isn't going to play nice with mesh colliders.  You usually have to try to keep things at or near the meter scale.  For example, the golf ball will work well at 0.5 units wide, just remember to scale gravity or it'll look like it's falling in slow motion."
Unity3D,3duwtk,uzimonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:38:58 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to hijack this thread, but what kind of scale would you (or anyone else) suggest for complicated road networks which represent real world locations, and are made up from 3D models which are then navmesh'd inside Unity?  I've found the scale of the whole road network to be a big issue - agent pathfinding is extremely unreliable at lower scales. Changing navmesh voxel settings seems to have no effect. Increasing scale a lot seems to improve pathfinding reliability but bake time is astronomical.  This isn't what I'm doing, but say you wanted to bake a navmesh for only the road network of GTA V's map (http://i.imgur.com/iEFQIYl.jpg) - around what scale do you think would be the sweet spot for accuracy and bake time?"
Unity3D,3duwtk,bitgus,3,Mon Jul 20 02:23:12 2015 UTC,"You'd probably want to keep that on real world scale.  However, something like GTA V is not made as a single map, it's done in tiles.  The navigation meshes are stitched together at runtime just like all the other meshes.  Unfortunately, I don't think Unity's API allows for this.  Further, in order to navigate long distance there will be a second method of navigation, such as the GPS style navigation which can stay in memory for the whole game.  If I recall, GTA also uses a single navmesh for the whole terrain, including the roads.  It's just that the roads have a much lower cost for cars and probably higher cost for pedestrians.  This means AI cars will tend to stick to the roads and possibly return to scripted navigation and pedestrians will tend to avoid roads.  But yeah, if you try to bake a navmesh on a huge terrain all at once it's not going to go well.  It's either going to be too coarse to be useful or too fine to be done in a finite time or without crashing Unity and taking too much memory at runtime."
Unity3D,3duwtk,OneRandomCatFact,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:44:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that was helpful! I've not been able to find anything about pathfinding specific to my kind of needs, or anything about scaling, it all seems to be focused on smaller levels. My end goal is probably closer to GTA's GPS system and a navmesh is overkill I'd guess, but I'm going to test this road network at real world scale and see if it's any better, cheers."

If it can't find any category names in your array/list it will always go to the else at the end.  Currently your code will only check the first item of the array, and if it is not the same it will return null. Returning something completely breaks out of a function so you should only call 'return' once you're satisfied that none of the items in your array are the same as what you passed in.  Hopefully that makes sense!"

Unity3D,3dwgab,REXanadu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:39:33 2015 UTC,EDIT: after some thought I think you may mean like mission specific triggers or something. I haven't had to do much of that in the games I've been making.  I try to make a bunch of encapsulated reusable code objects that I can drop into levels as needed rather than having mission specific code. Then its just all saved in the scene and the amount of code I have to write is minimized. Plus I can reuse all those bits in other games later.   This method seems to require a bit more time at the beginning but saves time later.

It's a process of turning objects in memory to a stream of bytes which can later be deserialized.  When you are creating a scene or a prefab in Unity, it is serializing it to disk as well on save, either in its binary or yaml-based format.  JSON and XML are just text based data storage formats, which are easy for humans to read and edit, but are quite inefficient. There's a lot of binary serialization options like protobuf, thrift, bson or msgpack that are faster and more compact. And you can always create your own."

Unity3D,3dt2in,DMeville,9,Sun Jul 19 04:37:30 2015 UTC,Awesome Work! I'm really impressed! care to share what types of algorithms you are applying? And does your generator take into consideration start and end points? or is that a future update :)
Unity3D,3dt2in,IAmTheParanoia,15,Sun Jul 19 06:42:08 2015 UTC,"Absolutely!  Thanks for the kind words :) Right now it doesn't have an ""end point"".  I'm considering just choosing a ""dead end room"" and making it warp you to a boss room, but that's something I still need to decide how to handle.  The map also doesn't create any ""looping"" rooms, which I might be tackling next along with a whole slew of locked doors, keys, all that stuff.  Still lots of fun stuff left to figure out!  Here's an overview of what's happening:  First things first, I should say that the rooms themselves are pre-constructed prefabs - which will eventually be outfitted with little puzzles, hordes of enemies, which will have a random aspect to it as well - along with some random aesthetic things.  These prefabs require a little bit of setup before I can throw them into the list of ""possibleRoomsToGenerate"".  When I'm creating a new Room prefab I have to do two things:   Place the doors, which are the locations where the room will connect to other rooms [Image].  Generate a ""voxel volume"" for the room.  This is just a 3d grid that defines the volume this room takes up and looks something like this: [Image] [Image]. The volume can be as many or as few voxels as I want, and can have ""complex"" shapes [Like this room which has a hole in the middle].  I have some editor scripts that help make this a quick and painless process.   After I have a few rooms I throw them all into a List and these are all the possible rooms I can generate, and the generator starts.  First it places down the ""spawn"" room (which is just a random room in the ""possibleSpawnRoomsList"") and adds it to a list called openSet, which is just a set of all the rooms that still have doors that haven't been linked up to anything.  Then it starts a loop while(openSet.count >0) { GenerateNextRoom();}  Where the GenerateNextRoom does a few things:   Finds the first unconnected door from openSet[0] Grabs a random room from the listOfPossibleRooms and instantiates it Lines up the two rooms so that the door from step one lines up with the first door from the newly instantiated room Then it does some math (using the volumes defined on each room) to see if:   The new room is overlapping with any already placed rooms The new room is overlapping with any door voxel neighbours (which are the voxels adjacent to the doors, in the direction the door is exiting) The new room's door voxel neighbours overlap with any other room's door voxel neighbours  If any of those tests fail, we try a different room! Once we find a room that passes we commit to it, set the doors we just connected together to ""closed"", and if the room has any other doors still left open we add it to the end of the openSet list.  We also remove openSet[0] if all it's doors are now closed. This loop continues until openSet is empty, or until ""numRoomsTarget"" is reached, in which case we just add ""end rooms"" to close off all the open connections   That's pretty much the gist of it!  I think it can generate some pretty cool looking dungeons which are ""sometimes"" tightly packed together (RNG permitting!) but never overlap or generate rooms with doors that lead directly into a wall from another room (Step 4.2 checks for this!).  It can also create some really cool intertwined rooms like this where the hole in the middle of a room is filled by a ""elevator shaft"" room!  Hope that all makes sense!  If you have any other questions or anything ask away! :)"

That is a really cool looking area.  Nice work on your generator.  It already looks great but I know that you will be making more improvements on it.  Suggestion:  Once you get it working really well, put the code up on the asset store where developers can either use the base rooms that you provide, or create their own rooms based of of some compatible parameters that you give them.  Make it where the dev can specify the location of the doors in their rooms so that your algorithm will work with the rooms they design.  I'll bet it would be a pretty popular asset.  You could even provide a few extras (character controller with camera script, props, textures, etc.) so that your asset could be used as the base for a full game.  Again, great job on the generator.  Looks awesome!"
Unity3D,3dt2in,davehampson,6,Mon Jul 20 00:16:14 2015 UTC,"I always thought it would be cool to do this:   have a predictable random number generator based off a seed get a bunch of willing beta testers generate seeded mazes and get beta testers to play them and rate how fun they were and how difficult they were. store results in a database, e.g. seed:0xdeadbeef difficulty 5.5, fun: 8.9 include the most fun levels in the final game with increasing difficulty   edit - forgot to say: this looks very cool :-)"

Unity3D,3dt2in,Kuothe,3,Sun Jul 19 07:55:41 2015 UTC,"It's kind of just a nice byproduct of the way I'm generating and connecting rooms together.  The generator doesn't care about the position of the doors, it just connects them by rotating/positioning the room so that the doors of the two rooms line up.  If I remove all the rooms from the generator except an ""up"" room it might illustrate this a bit better.  [Gif]  It's really cool when it steps up a vertical level then branches off.  That's one of the big reasons I like this method, adding some vertical differences between rooms I think makes things a bit more interesting and will be more fun to explore!

For further learning I suggest you study linear algebra and learn about vector manipulation, matrices, vector products (dot/cross). These topics are incredibly valuable when working with 3D spaces.   You can do so here: https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra  The Wolfire Games blog also has a helpful series of articles on how linear algebra applies to game development."

You are not letting the physics engine resolve collisions, so you end up moving the enemy collider and the player collider inside each other. (so then they start spazzing the hell out)  Normally if you moved your physics objects properly (using the rigidbody, or using a character controller), then the physics engine will resolve these issues and just make it seem like your enemy and player are just bumping into each other but not ever intersecting the colliders.  You should either disable physics for player/enemy layers (so then the player and enemy will just phase through each other), or move your entities with rigidbody forces or setting the velocity yourself."

Looking at your code it seems like you want the characters feet to rotate to be on the ""ground"" of the wall you want to walk on?   So if you are on the floor, and you walk up to a wall that's at a 90degree angle to your character. What happens, you want his feet to move the the wall in question so he rotates 90 degress? Then you need him to be able to walk freely?  Making the assumption above, not sure how your code will make this work. Seems like the rotation part would work fine, just you might need to do some trickery with the gravity. The gravity needs to change direction somehow, or your character would just fall to the ground (assuming you are using phyisc based movement, and using gravity)."

Mostly due to the fact that I do not know what to piece together until I got to know Unity3D from internet 3.5 years ago.  That was the first time I became serious with Unity3D game engine (at that time it was version 3.x). The more I explore it, the more I liked it!  Firstly, it is C#/JavaScript. Secondly, it solves a lot of my worry (e.g. the ease to organize assets, level designs, sound/music, data storage, etc.) which I never found to be intuitive when working with many (old) game engines. Since then, I've been sticking around with Unity3D. And I'm glad it's still free for low budget developers like me."

I had to work with Gambryo for a work project (simulator).  I had to do everything by hand.  The level editor had to be purchased separately and it was still relatively new and didn't work very well (around 2006-2007).  Then I moved on to Torque for a personal project.  I paid for the Pro version.  I thought that thing was awesome because at least it had a way to create terrain and a lot of other great things.  I used a few other small engines here and there before finding Unity.  Talk about the sunlight shining through parting clouds and the angels singing.  I had finally found an awesome game engine.  I love Unity.  I've tried CryEngine and Unreal too.  I do like them a lot but I don't have a really powerful system at home and they kind of bog my system down.  Unity is smooth and has never given me issues.  Speaking of it being free.  When 3.0 came out, I paid for the Pro version.  I also bought Pro 4.0 and the iOS Pro license ($3000 total).  Now all that capability is available for free except for a few things that don't bug me at all.  Talk about a great deal for indie developers."

However, compared to 2D focused engines like Game Maker and Construct, Unity is notably more complex.  You didn't mention any programming experience in your post. Be aware that in Unity you will need to do some programming, or get someone to program for you. Before jumping into game development I'd suggest checking out Code Academy and at least complete the JavaScript courses. Unity uses a modified version of JavaScript, sometimes called UnityScript, so thats why I suggest JS. Unity can also use C#, but I find JS to be a far more beginner-friendly language, and tutorials are usually written in JS."

Unity3D,3dsvr7,RFDaemoniac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:42:27 2015 UTC,You probably could just use high friction and high torque.   I don't think you could apply to just the edge because the torque is around the center of mass.  But it might work with enough friction anyways.    Changing the center of mass procedurally isn't a crazy thing. A little bit of vector math that's all.

Unity3D,3dsvr7,RFDaemoniac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:39:37 2015 UTC,I mean it would behave as if you flipped a cube over one side.  It will do exactly what he wants without having to procedurally add joints.  If he knew where to put the joints he could just change the center of mass to that location then after it flipped set it back to the transform.position or rigidbody position.
Unity3D,3dsvr7,KilltheInfected,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:44:33 2015 UTC,"If you really want to go with hinge joints, you'll have to add one along the ""pivot"" edge before each flip, apply the force, and then destroy it.  Keep in mind that physics-based controls are tricky to get right. For instance, you'll need to adjust the magnitude of your upward force (or play with physics materials) so that the cube flips at the appropriate speed, without bouncing back. You'll also have to implement safeguards to make sure that the cube doesn't go progressively off-track due to small errors.  A cleaner and stabler option would be to use Transform.RotateAround with the pivot edge as the axis of rotation (easy to compute for a cube). In this way, you can finely tune the speed of your rotations and there's no risk of physics explosion. If you need to let your cube interact physically with other objects (eg. push them), you can still set it up as a kinematic rigid body."

Unity3D,3dr7i8,bellatesla,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:41:15 2015 UTC,Vector3.Forward is world coordinates so you need to convert it to local by transform.TransformDirection(Vector3.Forward); It gets a little confusing so draw lots of debug.drawrays to help you visualize all your directions and positions during your development.
Unity3D,3dr4a3,Theyrealone,7,Sat Jul 18 17:27:50 2015 UTC,"You have two problems in your shader.  First, the vertex color parameter you've defined in your VertexOutput struct and passing to the fragment shader is of type ""TEXCOORD0"". This will not cause your shader to fail, but it's probably a good idea to switch it to type ""COLOR"", for the sake of clarity, and to prevent potential problems in the future.  The second, is that your property _Col is not defined in your shader. Unity requires all externally visible properties to be placed in a property block at the top of the shader. Properties that aren't placed here are assumed to be used only in the shader, and aren't externally visible.   Add   Properties {     _Col (""Col"", Range (0, 1)) = 0.5 }   just before your subshader block, and everything should be working fine :)"

But if you're planning on using a big set of other post processing effects, like tonemapping, DoF, bloom, vignetting, screen space reflections and so on, I can't recommend using standalone image effects at all. In that case you will be better off performance wise using Jove or Scion where all effects are intergrated into a single pass."

As about details on performance hit of SSAO implementations, I can't really help you there - it would be best to ask in the SE forum thread which it's developer actually monitors. You'll have the best chance of getting a detailed answer there. Both packages come from competent developers so it's unlikely that the difference is huge, though. Difference in ms per frame without SSAO and with any SSAO will be orders of magnitude bigger than difference between SSAO Pro and SE SSAO enabled frame time. The only SSAO implementation I will not ever recommend using is the one from Standard Assets - it's atrocious in quality and yet eats around 25ms per frame, which is an insane performance hit barring it from use in any serious project."

Making games is a discipline, like painting, and like painting you have to practise every part of the process to become more skilled. Your first games should be small and simple, and cloning arcade games is the ideal way to achieve this.   If you don't publish them, you are not practising the final two steps of game development - publishing and marketing (which does not mean spending any money by the way) - and so you will not improve at these skills. For your later projects, which you will put lots of time, effort and potentially money into, if you haven't begun practising the skill of publishing and marketing in your earlier works, you will be bad at publishing and marketing, and all your efforts on these later games will be lost because you will not reach your playerbase.

Unity3D,3dq7g2,BlackDragonBE,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:17:33 2015 UTC,"Note: I will assume by ""total velocity"" you mean ""speed.""  You're modifying the velocity directly, which is never how I do it.  I always add forces instead and if I want to achieve a specific exact velocity, I just use F=ma to figure out the appropriate force to apply to get there in one frame.  Still, you should be able to do it your way...  But you are assigning the velocity without regard for the magnitude.  That is, you have this:  rigidbody2D.velocity = new Vector2(modifying, rigidbody2D.velocity.y);   I see two problems with this:  First, I don't know what the interaction between your direct-assign of the velocity and the physics engine's own adjustment of the velocity will be.  I am surprised not to see a - in front of the y velocity, indicating to me that it's bouncing off the paddle via the physics engine as well as whatever your code is doing.  So I bet you have a weird interaction going on there that I can't comment on.  You can do direct assigns of velocity if you insist, but you shouldn't have both your own code AND the physics engine firing and fighting over what the correct result is.  That's why /u/3000dollarsuit is telling you to make it a trigger:  so that the physics engine will not update the velocity and ONLY your code will be in charge.  I bet you'll need the -y if you do that.  Second, even if your code is in charge (which I doubt), it seems that it will still modify the total velocity, since you directly assign the x to either 4 or -4, without any concern for the total magnitude of the vector.  For example if you set x to 4 when the current x is 1, this means an increase in total speed.  If the current x is 8 though, it means a decrease in speed.  If you want to maintain the total magnitude of the velocity vector I think you want something like this:  float speed =   rigidbody2D.velocity.magnitude; rigidbody2D.velocity = new Vector2(modifying, rigidbody2D.velocity.y).normalized * speed;   So you modify the x vector, but by normalizing the result and then scaling it by the original speed, you know that velocity will have the same total magnitude when you're done.  Hope that helps some, good luck!"
Unity3D,3dq7g2,savagehill,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:41:17 2015 UTC,"It's because you are setting the X velocity to your variable ""modifying"" which is always 4 (or -4). Your velocity will always be 4/-4. See lines 21 and 26.  What you want to do is use the magnitude (total velocity) and set that as your X velocity vector.

It's that simple. I get mad at myself when I am not creating and learning new things. I get mad a myself when I sit round and watch TV all night. But if I code all night and make something awesome I feel awesome for days and days or even years later.

Since photography is one of the games main mechanics, I think it would be great if the GamePad was used as a camera screen, similarly to Fatal Frame or Star Fox, but that would require rendering the scene twice, so it might not be possible.

I think we're settling on a method to grab every object and dependency of a scene and swap it's materials from desktop to mobile during a build.

How did you get permission to publish on Wii U, or are you actually a pretty big deal in game development?"
Unity3D,3dpp15,j_a_m_i_e,5,Sat Jul 18 06:18:42 2015 UTC,"Do's:   Try to teach things without the need for words, symbols, or breaks from gameplay as much as possible. The newer Mario games are brilliant at this: when a new power-up appears, it's usually presented by itself as a focal point in an otherwise empty or low-action area, which is immediately followed by a simple, low-risk puzzle requiring the power-up. This lets the player identify, analyze, and understand the new item without a single line of tutorial text, hint pop-up, or pause in the gameplay. If you do have to teach something with words or symbols, keep it extremely brief, and be creative. Diegetic tutorial text/symbols can work wonders provided you can guide your player's eyes to it. Otherwise, a small, non-intrusive corner-of-the-screen pop-up can also work. If your player actions are sufficiently complex to require a walkthrough tutorial or in-game spoken explanation, try to theme it to the game. Portal's voice-overs from GLaDOS and the 2009 Ghostbusters game's barked orders from Ray are two of my favorite examples of games with built-in spoken explanations of controls which are tied directly to the action. If you feel you need a complete step-by-step tutorial outside of normal gameplay, again, try to theme it to the game. Half-Life had the Hazardous Environment Suit Training Course, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has the shooting range - things like that keep the player in the world of the game while they're learning. Be interactive! This should go without saying, really - the player is here to play the game, after all, not watch/read about it.   Don'ts:   Don't have a cutscene every time a new control is introduced, especially if there are a lot of them. Crash TwinSanity has a lengthy running-and-jumping tutorial which cuts to a 10-second clip every 20 seconds of gameplay. It's not so bad the first time through, especially since it kicks off the game's plot; but if you lose before the checkpoint at the end, you have to do it all again, including every single cutscene. It's excruciating for the impatient player. Having an unskippable video of another character jumping across a pit does nothing that, say, a signpost next to the first pit you come to showing a character jumping with a big picture of the jump button next to it wouldn't do better. Avoid pop-ups or other gameplay pauses unless they're player-initiated. Maybe you absolutely need a little text explanation. Could you do it through written notes from an unseen character that the player can find? Maybe through signposts the player can interact with? Could you do it between levels instead of mid-level? Don't unexpectedly throw something in the player's face when they're trying to get into a groove playing your game, because it will break them out of it and make it difficult to feel engaged. Don't use walls of text. Brevity is key. It's one of my weakest points (just look at how much I've written here! :P) and is something I hope to one day master, because less is more when it comes to tutorial text. Keeping it brief is the best thing, but if you absolutely must have a lengthy block of text, try putting only a little bit on-screen at a time. There's a reason RPG dialog boxes are only a few lines tall, even with entire novellas' worth of dialog in a single scene."

Unity3D,3dpp15,Pingly,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:34:59 2015 UTC,"Oh haha!! In that case, I'm a big fan of the ""learn by doing"" approach that something like Portal / Portal 2 takes. Each new mechanic is introduced in a ""safe"" environment where the player can come to grips with how they work at their own pace.  Obviously, this wouldn't work for all types of games. A deep RPG or strategy game is going to need to have text explaining the more advanced systems. For those type of games, I think a dedicated ""help"" widget that can be hidden at any time, but shows context specific information is a good approach.  For basic controls, I'd say show them all at once at the very beginning of the game in one go. For the vast majority of players, they will have played enough games that (as long as they're conventional controls) there will be no problem learning these, so avoid dragging out basic control tutorials for 20 minutes. Less experienced players can still just refer to a controls menu if they forget any."

Unity3D,3dpr2x,Hell_Krasher,8,Sat Jul 18 06:45:49 2015 UTC,"Using rigidbodies for player movement (unless it's ""true"" physics based movement like a car or ball, etc.) is error prone, hard to control and full of annoying edge cases.  Use a CharacterController, then implementing leaps is very straightforward, you just move the CC around as you want, possibly with a curve to modulate the force/speed"
Unity3D,3dpr2x,fholm,2,Sat Jul 18 07:57:09 2015 UTC,I mix these two approaches - rigidbody.MovePosition and rigidbody.MoveRotation both keep physics happy and let you explicitly set position.

Unity3D,3dpr2x,Jespur,2,Sat Jul 18 19:14:40 2015 UTC,Wouldn't work well if you wanted (multiple) collision shapes other than a capsule though.
Unity3D,3dpr2x,neoncraze,2,Sat Jul 18 08:41:14 2015 UTC,"I once did a game that sounds similar to what you have. What I did was modify my jump function to act as a push function instead. Changing the direction and variables controlling strength allowed me to emulate pushes/charges etc.   You could use a ray cast as your direction, and the velocity could be set by your trigger. With such a function created, you could call for it whenever you'd like.   That said. Your game sounds interesting! Any showcase of it available?"
Unity3D,3dpr2x,Morphexe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:15:11 2015 UTC,"You can probably ""hack"" a bit your jump function...  In my PGDK asset I have a dash move (think sonic homing attack), the way this works, is I have a dash state, and while dashing I force the player velocity to be the dash direction for a certain amount of time ( x secs). when time is over I change to the falling state, and wait for the state machine to update accordingly the state (Ground, or if on the air fall).  modifying the velocity will make all your other collisions work (just don't make the velocity a ridiculous ammount, otherwise u will need to raycast the player and fine a collision point to stop moving through thin colliders).  This is relaitvely straight forward, you might be overthinking it.  Reflecting is just a matter of setting using the normal of the place on collision and cross the normal with player velocity and change the velocity in that direction."
Unity3D,3dpr2x,Morphexe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:25:54 2015 UTC,"Thnks for the input. Im reading here that everydoy is telling me that modifing the velocity of a rigidbody can bring problems, they tell me to use forces or change to a CharacterController. What you think about that? My movement is working exactly as i wanted, and yeah is not SUPER intuitive but it works great. I dont think i can achieve the same result using forces..."
Unity3D,3dpr2x,Morphexe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:16:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly? It works for me. The movement is fluid, works exactly like I want.  and doing this velocity += 1000 *time.fixeddelta; Is pretty much the same as doing AddForce, at least I think so.  The point is if it works for you, and works the way you want it, nothing prevents you. In  my Asset, the movement works quite nice, you just need to be careffull to not give a biig speed change that would make the character poassthrough small colliders, other than that I can't really find areason for you to not use it."

I created -what in some time ill be - my abilities controller script and there i call an abilitie, in this case a Charge. I set a flag so the PlayerManager keeps track of the skill, and this one gets the Players Forward vector and mutiplies it by the skill speed and asigns it directly to the Rigidbody.velocity. It actually works pretty well for 30min of trying.  Problems im having... first i need to make a good script, see how i ll handle all of this and player movement at the same time. Second, i need to make it STOP when reaches and enemy or if it hits a wall to hard, cos right now it slows down but it keeps tring to do the charge, since i made it Time based for now."

Its fine for collision with enemies, but when u charge directly against a wall it should stop the skill, and i cant mark EVERYTHING, not a good idea.   I need someway to detect if im charging and colliding with an object directly, i mean when the normals are the same +180º. Or maybe theres a better way, dunno."
Unity3D,3dpr2x,LordNode,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:34:20 2015 UTC,"I always use the rigidbody with forces, myself.  When I want to ""instantly directly assign"" the velocity like you're saying, I just use F=ma/Time.fixedDeltaTime to compute the force that would get me to that velocity in a single frame.  There's no reason that using forces has to mean laggy soupy inertia-heavy control feel.  That said, your approach probably can be worked out, I just don't do it that way myself.  I'd worry about fighting against the physics system with your approach.  Second thing I always end up with is state machine for movement control.  So like, am I jumping?  You can have lots of raycast checks and such but I find I end up organizing it into a state machine because it helps me control animation more simply and it's easy to add things like ""when the guy is sprinting he can't duck"" and so on.  So for a charge, I would:   Add some input detection for the comand Decide what states you can enter the charge from (idle, walking, but not jumping for example) Add a new state for ""Charging"" and decide what possible exits there are from that state (ie it completes on a timer and exits to idle, OR the user can cancel out of a charge by jumping, or whatever you decide) Write some code for what actually happens when entering the charge state, and while in it.   So maybe upon ENTERING the charge state I boost the velocity with a big force but then the player cannot control during the charge, if that's my design.  Another approach would be to check on every single frame that I KEEP applying a force to MAINTAIN the intended charge velocity/direction.  If there's some fancy interaction, such as ""when charging if I hit a purple guy then it reverses my direction"" or so on, then I might have to go into the collision detection, check if I'm in the charge state, and adjust some chargeDir variable that is used in the charge-maintenance code.  Maybe not the best way but that's the sort of thing I usually end up doing.  Problem I run into is the intersection of state machines.  For example, I have a state machine for moving, and another state machine for the gun, with things like ""ready, firing, recoiling, reloading"" etc.  The problem is when those start off totally disconnected but then I decide to say ""when the player is sprinting, he cannot fire his gun or reload, and going into a sprint during a reload will cancel the reload.""  Such overlaps make things more annoying."

I can think of a hundred UI bugs, like a button didn't check for the right requirements before enabling itself. This is the sort of bug that comes back over and over. Unit tests could help you find that bug before you commit it to the main branch and ruin the day for everyone else.  Integration testing is even harder to justify on a small project. If that project is not going to live much longer than 6 months and you don't plan on supporting after that, then this sort of testing will have far less milage.   Testing anything is hard.

Unity3D,3dn731,CatchCo,3,Sat Jul 18 00:27:07 2015 UTC,"Okay. Unit testing in games is kind of a problem in itself and hotly debated. Of course every code is testable, but if you spend more time on writing tests than you need to write your code, it's counter-productive. Especially time-sensitive game mechanics are very hard to test with straight Unit Tests (but not impossible).  A good general way of doing tests for games is separating your game code into three test categories: Unit Testable, Integration Testable and User Testable.  Unit Testable code is pretty much anything that is dependent on math or everything that is happening in a single frame. Examples are: Damage calculations, AI actions, algorithms like A* and so on. If you have a single function that does one special thing, it is most likely Unit Testable.  Integration Testable code is anything that needs to be tested inside an environment (like a level with NPCs) or needs to run over multiple frames. Examples are: Complex AI behaviours, gameplay triggers, dialogue trees, etc. If you have behaviour that works without having to run the full game and in separation from other features, it is most likely Integration Testable.  Everything else needs to be tested by users and play testers. You can write down test instructions (like: ""Test if you are able to beat the boss of the second dungeon without having a single fight before him"") to test specific situations that are too complex for Integration Tests, or you can just let them play the game and hope they find problems for you to solve.  But with everything related to testing in games: Don't forget that you are trying to make a game, not a test engine. If you spend too much time writing tests, you don't have enough time to code the game any more. Have tests for absolutely critical mechanics or methods, have tests for stuff that is dependent on another system and may break easily. But don't write trivial tests for trivial functions."
Unity3D,3dn731,loofou,2,Fri Jul 17 21:28:51 2015 UTC,"I always just do a ton of user testing. The critical issues are uncovered very quickly, and it also provides feedback on things like ease of use, fun factors, and difficulty settings. Writing objectives for user tests is much easier than trying to black box or white box test a game, IMO."

Unity3D,3dn731,timothyallan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:21:26 2015 UTC,"Testing comes in all sorts of varieties and for various purposes. I'm assuming you are talking about Unit Testing and Integration Testing. These are the sorts of tasks that can be automated and are usually highly focused in what they are trying to verify. But why?  That's the biggest question anyone should answer when they are about to write tests. Not because you need to justify spending time away from feature development, but because you need to know what you are gaining by testing in the first place.  In my experience with software development in large companies and on my own, Unit Testing is a methodology that helps you track down bugs later. It prevents regression when someone takes a 2nd pass at an old piece of code many weeks or months later. If a build breaks due to a bad merge or a new team member you can (theoretically) quickly track down the source of the problem, since the tests should have failed.  Of course this will only catch certain kinds of bugs. It won't find complex interactions between many game agents since Unit Tests are supposed to test one ""unit"" of work, such as the result of a method or properly catching exceptions, etc.  Writing testable code and the tests themselves is an art that can have big impacts on teams somewhere down the line, but probably not a huge impact immediately. That being said, the longer you go without developing in a way that is testable, the bigger hole you are digging. You will have bugs - stupid, horrible, hidden, hard to reproduce bugs. It's a 100% certainty. The only control you have over this fate is the tools and methods you will use to find and fix them. Testing is one of them."
Unity3D,3dn731,CatchCo,0,Sat Jul 18 00:18:20 2015 UTC,"If you google ""unity unit testing"" there are quite a few examples, even from Unity's own blog, on how to do this.

With a shooter, you just need simple first person controls, spawn a bullet on left click, and simple collision detection, and there's the meat of your game right there.  Other games have this problem, too.

Seems here like all AIs follow the exact same strategy.

The rear-most defenders will rarely cross the half way line. As the ball gets closer to the blue goal, the blue team will fall back, again relative to their positions, and scrunch up towards their goal. The forward-most attackers will  stay as far forward as they can. I.e. in line with the last second-to-last defender (including goalie), or at the half way line.

If we really wanted to get deep into this, I'd have position colliders, and player colliders. If a player is at the edge of their position collider and their player collider is on the ball, and the other team mates collider isn't, they could go get the ball, and bring it back to their position...

Unity3D,3djp4a,HypnoToad0,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:30:37 2015 UTC,"Well in sports they also take into account the other players not just the ball. The defenders on one side get between the forwards and the ball if possible, closer to the forward if the ball is on the other side of the field. Think interception and defense of players as a goal not just the ball."

Unity3D,3djp4a,Sir_Cuitry,2,Thu Jul 16 23:43:13 2015 UTC,"Just make up some simple rules or unit behaviors. You could base it on the hive-mind combat behaviors of Uncharted 2.  Add invisible objects or zones to which a player needs to stay close to.  Behavior rule 1: A player needs to stay in his designated zone  Behavior rule 2: Move to a position between the ball and your team's goal, but very close to the ball, if the ball gets within a certain range (range may vary between players)  Behavior rule 3: Move away from a team mate if it gets within a certain range. (makes a team spread out more)  Behavior rule 4: Move to an opponent if it gets within a certain range. (more defensive behavior)  Behavior rule 5: Move toward the opposing team's goal when close to the ball and the ball lies between you and the goal. Perhaps do a kick action if the mechanics allow it.  Have these behaviors compete with each other as described in the linked article above.  It shouldn't be that hard for a programmer to work out the logic.  This only describes simple moving behavior. If you also want things such as passes or evading opponents who try to get the ball then you probably have to make some more complex rules."

Defenders (not goalies) - Each one should remember his starting position via a variable. If he strays X distance from his start position have him return unless he is VERY close to the ball. If he's very close to the ball and he's 2X distance from his start position make him return anyways. Attackers - if X number of players are very close to the ball, have a random forward player run to an unpopulated area on the field. Preferably an area that is between the ball and the goal. Have him wait awhile to catch a passed ball. Better teach these guys to kick/pass the ball! Anyways, if the ball gets too far back into the other side of the field, have him return to his start position or just attack the ball again. Wild card - give each team a weird player and give him a list of weird behaviors that he randomly chooses. Knock over a nearby player, circle around to the other side of the ball maybe... I don't have very many ideas for weird behavior unless it's my weird behavior.    I hope I helped. I never realized how much logic goes into sports."

Whenever I try getting the renderer component it won't let me change the material and will stop loading in my tiles. I think my logic is off not the semantics. I went ahead and edited the original post, I have the GetComponent<Renderer>() and before that I was using GetComponent<MeshRenderer>(). I'm not sure how to get this to work with a for loop. As of right now it completely shuts off my loop."
Unity3D,3doiw8,Dead_Sparrow,0,Sat Jul 18 06:44:21 2015 UTC,"The issues with the code you've posted; you don't get a random material for each object, your only getting a single random material. Also rather than getting the renderer of the objects you created your getting the renderer of the object spawning them. As you said the logic is wrong. As for why you get an error, it would probably be because your spawner has no renderer component.  Before loop;  GameObject tile; Renderer renderer;   In loop;  tile = (GameObject)GameObject.Instantiate(prefab, new Vector3(j * 1.5f - 3, i * -1.5f + 3, 0), transform.rotation); renderer = tile.GetComponent<Renderer>(); renderer.material = mats[Random.Range(0, mats.Length)];   Technically above could all be one line, but I find it more readable and thus easier to debug when it's laid out like this.  Also your line 'prefab.name = count.ToString();' won't rename the created object, as your prefab variable refers to the prefab not instances of it. If you do it as I have above you'd do 'tile.name = count.ToString()' to name it.  There is also no point in setting 'gameStart' to false in the loop like that, move it outside the loop so it is only set once.  In anycase it seems you have very limited knowledge of programming, as the logic of your posted code is not designed to do what you want it to. I suggest you do some basic programming tutorials."

Unity3D,3dmzxs,Kwinten,4,Fri Jul 17 16:29:10 2015 UTC,"This was actually a problem I've had in all my previous projects. I now know why! With the new UI system came an EventSystem, this event system handles mouse clicks on the UI. However, it can also handle clicks on colliders, both 3D and 2D!      Check this out, basically you want to add a raycaster to your main camera and implement IPointerDownHandler or IPointerClickHandler on the object you want to click. The Event Trigger component from that tutorial is optional by the way, you could use it if you want to set it all up in the editor like you would with buttons.  Now, when you did all of this, you won't have to worry about the UI letting clicks through anymore, as it's all handled automatically."

Unity3D,3dly4i,Deculsion,2,Fri Jul 17 09:59:14 2015 UTC,"Do you want to trigger events at certain timestamps in the audioclip, or do you want something more dynamic, where events are triggered based on the actual audio data?  You could quite easily write a class that holds an audioclip and source, and define a list of timestamps at which certain events should be triggered.  Maybe being a bit more specific would help me understand your problem. :)"
Unity3D,3dly4i,Kwinten,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:22:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not quite familiar with audio in Unity3D, so I don't really know the nuances of it. I'm intending to manually have events occur at certain time stamps in the music, and it should always occur the same way and I'll be manually scripting where the events occur during the music.   Interested to know how trigger based on audio data works too, though."
Unity3D,3dly4i,Kwinten,3,Fri Jul 17 10:29:51 2015 UTC,"Seems fairly simple then. The way I'd do it:   Define a class, let's call it TimedEvent, that holds an int (timestamp) and a UnityEvent. A UnityEvent allows you to conveniently choose what functions to call from the inspector. Define another class that holds a reference to an AudioSource and an array TimedEvents. Make your interface for playing the audio go through the above class. When the audiosource starts playing, you could fire off a coroutine for each TimedEvent. It could use a WaitForSeconds, using the timestamp of the TimedEvent.   Seems like a fairly clean solution. And you can define all these variables like the timestamp and event through the inspector."
Unity3D,3dly4i,Kwinten,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:18:36 2015 UTC,Hmm I don't think I quite get what you mean. Do you mean creating a TimedEvent class like this in a separate script? And then something like this for the gameobject that contains an audio source and triggers the events? And I'm not quite sure how to go about step 3 with what I've gathered.
Unity3D,3dly4i,Kwinten,2,Fri Jul 17 12:08:39 2015 UTC,"Nearly there! This is how I would go about it: TimedEvent does not need to inherit from MonoBehaviour (since you will not put as a separate behaviour on a GameObject). TimedEvent also needs to be marked as serializable, so it will show up in the inspector. Like so:  [System.Serializable] public class TimedEvent {     public UnityEvent Event;     public int TimeStamp; }   And then in your class that contains the AudioSource, you can set the TimedEvents array as public, or like this:  [SerializeField] private TimedEvent[] TimedEvents;   Using the SerializeField will also make the array show up in the inspector, with the added security of keeping your variables private.  In your inspector, you should see something like this.  If you are not familiar with UnityEvents, they allow you to drag in any object from your scene, and call any public function of any script on that object. I dragged in my UI Canvas, which has a LevelManager script attached to illustrate. That UnityEvent will call the public LevelManager.Resume() function.  In your code, you can then call the function associated with the event by doing CallFunction.Invoke();"
Unity3D,3dly4i,Kwinten,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:30:51 2015 UTC,"Uh okay I'm sort of getting it now. I've gotten the event list to come out, but I have no idea how to get it to work. Thing is, each event at each time may have different enemy spawning. I've been fiddling around with the code and I still can't get any functions to show up. http://i.imgur.com/lNqLcaC.png"
Unity3D,3dly4i,ddutchie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:43:33 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest you put the enemy spawning logic in another script and let the TimedEvent class only contain the UnityEvent and timestamp. In the inspector, in the list of events, there's a plus and minus sign in the bottom right corner. You can use this to hook up any functions to the UnityEvent (so the event that fires off at a certain timestamp could call multiple functions).  Once you pressed the plus sign, you can drag in any GameObject into the object field. Then in the drop down menu, you will see all the scripts attached to the object, and you can select any public function that you want to call from the event.  If that's not clear to you, maybe the documentation will help a bit: http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityEvents.html"

So, if you don't need that transparency, the game mesh can be 2 triangles, and you can generate normal, height, and occlusion maps which you can plug into the Unity 5 standard shader.

Unity3D,3dmj3m,xianguru27,2,Fri Jul 17 14:04:13 2015 UTC,"I've made applications to do the same thing you're attempting in this video. From my experience I would suggest that your skeleton is not rigged correctly. If your model skeleton has a direct 1:1 relationship with the Kinect model you need to make sure the neutral state of the model matches the neutral skeleton state.  The Kinect skeleton can be represented as rotational values that chain from bone to bone. If both skeletons don't start in the same position, then any mapping from one to the other will have issues.  I suggest focusing on a single bone, the hip center to spine center. Draw a 3d arrow rgb/xyz that represents the rotation of the bone, and render a similar axis representation for the same bone in your model. If they both point the same way at the same time, you can move to the next bone in the chain. Be aware that the bones must have the same rotation about all axis, so the axis widgets should align exactly. A common issue I've found is that the bones were rigged with their front mapped to what could be considered the side or back of the associated Kinect bone.   Hope this helps"
Unity3D,3dmj3m,hig,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:07:40 2015 UTC,Thanks! Ive been trying to set up a calibration state but have had a few issues with that. Do you know where i can find the correct rotation map for the kinect axis?

This and this are the closest information I can find in the KinectV2 documentation. I'll keep looking and see if I can find the appropriate docs.  Edit: Found it. As I mentioned, this is for the older kinect, but a lot of the information is still valid. This gets relevant at the Hierarchical Rotation. And remember, the Kinect v2 skeleton has a different basic shape than the Kinect v1, so the bone heirarchy is not appropriate"

Serializing a gameobject on the other hand ( or specifically a reference to a gameobject ) is fairly complicated but there are solutions out there do it - and well. I would strongly suggest Full Serializer.  If you do want to use your own solution - well, the tutorial pretty much tells you what you need to do.

It is also, ultimately, a small industry. Don't burn bridges if you can avoid it (I mean, don't let people use and abuse you unfairly. Stand up for yourself, but don't be a dick to people or cut out on work because word will get around).  This is on top of being good, practicing, having tangible work you can show people. Also, the most important thing is to be able to deliver on stuff in a timely manner consistently.  How much you charge really depends. I've had people offer me really low rates, like 3k/mo for full time engineering work. I did take work like this just starting off, but it really sucked. Somewhere around 5k/mo is on the cheap end of the spectrum, but a more realistic rate. If you're good, you can command in the realm of 10k/mo+, particularly if you can do stuff that other people can't. The going rate often depends on where you're working. I work in the San Francisco Bay Area, pay tends to be higher here, but it's also an expensive place to live.  Don't be afraid to ask for money. You're negotiating an employment contract, it's a bargaining process and both sides are trying to get the best deal. Don't undersell yourself, and don't be afraid of scaring people off. If they want to work with you, they will haggle and you'll find a rate you can agree on. Also, don't agree to a rate that is too low.

So I assumed it doesn't apply.  From FAQ:  ""Question: 1.10 Does the full OFL license text always need to accompany the font?  Answer: The only situation in which an OFL font can be distributed without the text of the OFL (either in a separate file or in font metadata), is when a font is embedded in a document or bundled within a program. In the case of metadata included within a font, it is legally sufficient to include only a link to the text of the OFL on http://scripts.sil.org/OFL, but we strongly recommend against this. Most modern font formats include metadata fields that will accept the full OFL text, and full inclusion increases the likelihood that users will understand and properly apply the license.""  ""Question: 1.20 I'm writing a small app for mobile platforms, do I need to include the whole package?  Answer: If you bundle a font under the OFL with your mobile app you must comply with the terms of the license. At a minimum you must include the copyright statement, the license notice and the license text. A mention of this information in your About box or Changelog, with a link to where the font package is from, is good practice, and the extra space needed to carry these items is very small. You do not, however, need to include the full contents of the font package - only the fonts you use and the copyright and license that apply to them.""  I guess if you install the font you are distributing and if you just show it on screen it's embedding? I suppose you don't need to have the license if the user cannot extract the font from your game?

GameObject go = Instantiate(myPrefab) as GameObject; go.transform.position = myLocation;   You can use it directly in the Instantiate call but you will also need to supply it a rotation in the form of a quaternion.

Pooled_Object is used to help organize unique objects that get inserted into the system. To be honest I could just easily take it out and manage it, but I felt it would be easier to organize it into a class to mitigate confusion. Pooled_Object -> PooledObject to match style.   You naming is weird, especially methods that begin with PS_   You are totally right, I would have done better using namespacing PS_ removed.   There is no need for the pooling system to be a singelton. Maybe the user wants to have more than one?   There is no reason to be more than 1. It handles most Unity objects at the same time. It contains a collection of different unique set of objects and categorizes them. Think of a linked hash table.   There is no need for the pooling system to be a Monobehaviour. It is not rendered or updated every frame. Same for the PoolID   Sure I don't necessarily have to make the system a 'Monobehaviour' type object, however, I did this for the fact that it will help organized pooled objects. I could very well remove it and add in something to root the pooled objects, but I felt this was more appropriate. Just because something is not renderer or updated every frame doesn't mean you shouldn't use Monobehaviour. The class is quite helpful with a lot of things outside of those basic scopes. PoolID true doesn't need to have it as well, but I use it for the same reason above, however, it is more reasonable to remove it from that if need be. It is also a good indicator to help distinguish between pooled objects and non, not having to check through the system, but rather using Unity's GameObject.Find(...).   All in all, these are small semantics in how an individual approaches a problem. I have used Unity for quite some time and felt Monobehaviour has a lot of great benefits as it can interact with all other objects and features very well.  Edit: Monobehaviour also acts as a great quick debug check since you can see it in the scene and using Unity's inspector to check it out."

But it also does a good job of guiding you through the Unity Editor UI in a just-in-time fashion.  If you already know C#, you might want to heavily skim through the parts of the videos that go through coding and supplement with the API docs. If you don't know C# (like me), you'll probably watch the coding sections closely at first, and then skim through them eventually.  Also,  yes, the course isn't free. However, I've found that if you create a Udemy account and put the course on your wishlist, you'll soon find it on sale.

It might not help if your problem is deep in the engine, but it should show up if you are doing anything different in those frames.  The other option, which will be more work, but will help you see what is going on in the engine is to run the game in an external frame debugger like the Intel GPA.

To fix this just have a public GameObject for the thing you are finding and assign it in the scene view then you can access it as normal.

You could then call an enable or disable on the Weapon script which basically sets the child(0) to active or not. In the Weapon script I would then have a public GameObject for the child(0) so I don't have to do the GetChild call.  You can also have a CanShoot method or property which returns if the Weapon can shot. Hope that makes sense?  So yes I think WeaponManager does have some if not all elements of a Weapon."

Unity3D,3devr6,PizzaFetus,13,Wed Jul 15 21:48:44 2015 UTC,"Here's a brief overview of what I'm doing:  Each ""piece"" is a prefab that I refer to as a module. Each module has connectors (gameObjects with a connector script) as children. For example, a corridor module would have two connectors, and a junction module could have 3 or 4 connectors. The process starts by placing an initial module, and then adding that module's connectors to a list, we'll call it OpenConnections. From there it goes through a set number of iterations, placing a new module at each connector in OpenConnections. After each new module is placed, its additional connectors are thrown in a temporary list. After an iteration is complete and there are no more connectors in OpenConnections, the temporary list repopulates Open Connections and the process begins again. Currently, when the max number of iterations is reached, Wall prefabs are placed at the connectors instead of new modules. Each module is also tagged, and each connector has a list of acceptable tags that is referenced when randomly choosing a new module to place, so that only certain modules can be connected with one another.   I hope that was somewhat understandable."
Unity3D,3devr6,Your_Username_Is_Ok,6,Thu Jul 16 01:06:27 2015 UTC,"Very cool, and clearly explained! How do you plan to make it so that when a module is added onto one connector, it looks for other adjacent connectors so it can make an additional connection automatically? It looks like there are some gaps where connections could exist right now."
Unity3D,3devr6,ahcookies,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:19:57 2015 UTC,Yeah that's something I've been thinking about. I'm not sure if there's an efficient way to do so. Fallback plan would be to have larger prefabs that contain loops.
Unity3D,3devr6,konorbeatz,4,Thu Jul 16 12:15:31 2015 UTC,"I have a somewhat similar system, and I'd recommend to use a custom enum or a list with actual prefab references to configure potential compatible connections on the attachment nodes. Tags are very inconvenient to manage when your number of different object classes grows (wall mounted catwalk, wall mounted ladder, free catwalk, free ladder, 2m corridor, 1m corridor, 3m pipe, 1m corridor ladder and so on and so on), they decouple the module type from the attachment node component into the GameObject itself, which is not very clean, and tags make it very easy to cause memory leaks if you compare them carelessly.  At the moment I do this:   I have prefabs with Module component, with meshes, colliders and other fluff parented inside Every ModularObject has at least one empty child GameObject with the Node component Every ModularObject has a list with Node component references Every Node has a ModularObject reference pointing to it's owner, Node reference pointing to another node (attached counterpart, null in a prefab), an identifier string (e.g. ""node_topside_exit"") and a List of Preset class instances Preset class is a plain C# class (no inheritance from MB, just a simple container), and it contains a GameObject reference and a string List. You fill the Preset List of every Node of every ModularObject prefab with references to other ModularObject prefabs, and string List of each of those entries with identifiers of nodes that are compatible on the linked object. For example, a junction might have three nodes, two of which are compatible with ""node_front"" and ""node_back"" nodes of some corridor prefabs, and the last of those nodes compatible with ""node_catwalk_start"" of several catwalk entry objects.   This gives you some incredible options:   Open connections are very easy to check. Iterate over Node list of a given ModularObject, check if Node reference inside any given node is null - if so, there is no attachment there and you can grow the chain there. You have an explicit list of every possible instantiation option for any given open Node without going anywhere - it's right there in the Node Preset List. Growing the attachment chain becomes trivial. You can have stuff like a huge wall segment that can grow other huge wall segments on it's sides while growing small catwalks on it's surface. You will never get a tiny corridor attached to the cross section of a 10m pipe or a room growing out of a floor - you have infinite flexibility to set up very intricate object dependency chains. For example, you can have corridor objects - corridor to surface exit objects - surface objects - surface to stair objects - stair objects chain, etc. You have incredibly useful reference chain. For example, let's say you want to build the level around the player as he travels through the corridors, never growing the chain more than five steps beyond the player position. Easy! Just iterate through the Node List of a ModularObject you're at, and at each entry go through the following reference chain: Node List entry Node reference (attached counterpart) -> Node List entry Node reference ModularObject reference (owner). Create a recursive method accepting ModularObject as an argument and it will run not just on that first object: it will traverse through all surrounding objects, pick all neighbors attached further down the chain, pick all neighbors of those neighbors and so on. If you're not yet at recursion level 5, grow empty attachment Nodes, if you are at recursion level 5, destroy ModularObjects at the ends of reference chains. Nodes don't have to adhere to any kind of a grid, your levels can be very freeform   Some screenshots and gifs of that stuff:   http://i.imgur.com/3sa6PRp.jpg http://bac9.tumblr.com/post/122902792832/back-to-work"

From there you could check if the cursor is in the scene view, and do a raycast all. You'd then use On Scene GUI to pop up buttons to select the returned objects.

Unity3D,3dhstv,cebollinos,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:33:28 2015 UTC,"Foreword: I don't know your level of programming (I reckon mine is pretty low), so I'm explaining each part just in case. Maybe you'll find some of it useful, maybe I'll look a goof. Oh well.  I personally would have some sort of game manager that has a static instance which can be accessed globally.  Just make sure that you have one GameManager in the scene (and only one!).  The other key ingredient is a delegate. It can take on references to other methods that are like itself and calls them when it is called. I like to think of it like a method array.  public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour {     public delegate void OnKeyPress(GameObject gameObject);     public OnKeyPress DoOnKeyPress;      static GameManager instance;      public static GameManager Instance     {         get         {             if(instance == null)             {                 instance = FindObjectOfType<GameManager>() as GameManager;             }              return instance;         }     } }   So now that we have something that everything can access, we can send stuff to it to look after for us. We're going to send any references that we want called at the one time to DoOnKeyPress. We do this by simply adding them to it.  Since we're going to be doing a lot of the same thing (adding method references to a delegate, probably in Start), we're going to want our interactables to inherit from a parent class. This allows us to recycle some of our generalised behaviour. On top of that, each method is going to be different (a sword will act differently from a door, but both need to be 'interacted'), so I would advise using an abstract method that can be overwritten in the child class.  public abstract class Interactable : MonoBehaviour {      void Start ()     {         //Note that you can subtract references from delegates before you add them. This is a useful practice if you don't want double ups to occur         Player.Instance.DoOnKeyPress -= OnPressed;         Player.Instance.DoOnKeyPress += OnPressed;     }      void OnDestroy()     {         //Note that you'll also want to remove the references when the object is gone, so you don't have any phantom calls.         Player.Instance.DoOnKeyPress -= OnPressed;     }      //Using an abstract method here, since we've got lots of different kinds of interactions that could happen     public abstract void OnPressed(GameObject testedObject); }   Now we have a general framework for all of our interactable things. So we can now make a door (or any other interactable) super cleanly.  public class Door : Interactable {     //See here that we override Interactable's OnPressed method and give it its own door-y flavour     override public void OnPressed(GameObject testedObject)     {         if(gameObject == testedObject)         {             OpenDoor();         }     }      void OpenDoor()     {         Debug.Log(""Open Says-a-me!"");     } }   Final touch: The Hand.  public class Hand : MonoBehaviour {     void OnTriggerStay(Collider collider)     {         if(Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.E) && GameManager.Instance.DoOnKeyPress != null)         {             GameManager.Instance.DoOnKeyPress(collider.gameObject);         }     } }   Just trying it now as a simple test, it looks like it works.

Unity3D,3dhstv,TeckArtist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:53:45 2015 UTC,"I'd probably go the inheritance route. Have a base Interactable class, then potentially a Weapon class that inherits from that, and a Sword class that further inherits from Weapon (assuming you plan to have different types of weapons). Same deal with the door. Interactable could contain a public virtual (or abstract) Interact method, with the subclasses overriding that with their own implementations.  public class Interactable : MonoBehaviour {     public virtual void Interact() {         //base interaction stuff here     } }  public class Weapon : Interactable {     public override void Interact() {         base.Interact();         //weapon-specific stuff here     } }  public class Sword() {     public override void Interact() {         base.Interact();         //sword-specific stuff here     } }   Since your sword now inherits from Interactable, the reference in your Hand class can simply be of type Interactable, eg.  //Hand would basically assign this when the object is ""touched"" //You can do this without casting or referring to the specific subclass //eg. the sword object is of type Sword, but that inherits from Interactable //so you can just say activeObject = sword; private Interactable activeObject;   Then  //I hope you're not hardcoding keybindings like this! if(Input.KeyDown(Keycode.E)) {     //this will fire the appropriate Interact method     //ie. Sword will have its own Interact method fired     activeObject.Interact(); }   Inheritance in this case can be useful since it allows you to define common behaviour where necessary. For example, base Interact might trigger some audio (like a ""click"" sound or something). Weapon.Interact might apply damage to something. Sword.Interact might play a slashing visual effect. Since in the above example we're calling base.Interact() in each subclass, we get all the parent functionality automatically."

The sword has a script called ItemPickup that only cares about logic for picking up items. This script implements the IInteractable interface. When the player gets close and hits the trigger in ItemPickup and hits E, it calls the Interact function on ItemPickup, which is attached to the sword. The Interact function in ItemPickup is responsible for calling AddToInventory on your character.  You could have another script for doors called Door or DoorOpener. It utilizes the IInteractable, and when you call Interact, it simply opens the door.  I'm not sure of your programming knowledge, but an interface in .Net can be thought of as a contract. If a class implements an interface, it is agreeing to include any method declarations from the interface (in my example, Interact()). The nice part is, it can do whatever it wants in that method. So even though you interact with both a door and a sword, they do two entirely different things."

Unity3D,3df83z,ensiferum888,9,Wed Jul 15 20:19:15 2015 UTC,"I assume you already realize the obvious about the low and choppy fps in this capture. You'll have to find a way to boost those numbers if you want this to be presentable. What's odd though is that even with the poor capture rate that you'd choose to render this out at 1080p and at 60fps. Odd imo.  The trailer itself reads like a school project.   (0:00) Your opening disclaimer is fine. Keep it. But immediately after you give the credit for the music. Attribution is alright, but you don't put credits and legalese in a trailer.  (0:05) Then you display ""Manor Lord -- Teaser"" as a title card? We read the title of the video when we clicked. Its fine to display the title of your game and splash the logo, but this is just unfiltered text.  I'm not going to comment on the GUI as I know the game is still in alpha. Suffice it to say (0:30) that it's all over the place.  Then there's the issue of how your're presenting the information. Minimalist text in at the bottom is usually slated for when the eye is directed towards the visuals. But given that this is village sim building game with what looks to be a lot of menus you need to really grab our attention so that we can pick up on what we should be reading. Was this made in windows movie maker? Because the font and filter screams ""default text"".  (0:15) Alright so we're seeing some footage now and already there's a lot to take in. You just recorded raw footage, so we see menus and odd UI and it takes a second snap into ""oh that's what this is mode"". And let's see, we're building a village, perhaps it would be better to just show off some villages without all of the visual clutter and the game already being played; an establishing shot.  (0:30) ""Carefully assign council members to manage your fief"" Too boring and not worth showing this early. You started with building, so us some building. Like maybe that wall sequence at (1:42)? Group elements in with their logical companions.  (0:40) ""Provide your villagers with jobs and food"" Alrighty. Is that what's happening on screen? I think I see the tiny words 'crop field' pop up for a second. Also you'd probably want to put the part from (0:30) after this. First focus on your villagers, then focus on you council members. Because one is the surface layer of your game, while the other is what looks to be the more complicated meta to your game, so go in order.  (0:50) ""Random event system fully customizable"" What?  (0:58-1:07) ""Trade with neighboring villages... or the entire country"" We're now a minute in, and if you needed something to cut...  (1:10) Seasonal Effects! That looks amazing! What are you burying it this deep into the video? I've already clicked away by this point! You should show that off more! Or have your other sequences filmed at with varying weather to help break things up and provide visual interests. It might even be a good way to frame segments of your video subconsciously.  (1:28) ""Manage the workforce of the business you directly own"" Again that seems like logically it would be talked about when you bring up the villagers or council.  (1:35) That could have been your establishing shot. Its the least cluttered clip so far.  (1:45) Why are you presenting 2 separate piece of information at the same time? And as for combat not being in the game you could have omitted that information this time as I don't think it's needed.  (1:54) Really bad edit. You fade to black just to return to the exact same thing we're looking at. Were the cross fades not working?  (1:55) Ahh that's nice. 10 seconds where we can just take things in.  So I think I'm stated my case. Cinematography, and thinking about how your'e going to guide the viewer through what's being presented to them visually. Next time you should make sure the clips you're showing really show ""X is what's going on"". If we read the bottom text and visually its still not clear then you have a problem.  Remember you ease the viewer in, and explain the more complex features after the simpler ones. And also realize that some bits of information work better when grouped close together rather than just put wherever."
Unity3D,3df83z,Boss_Taurus,3,Wed Jul 15 21:36:49 2015 UTC,"Woah thank you so much! I really appreciate the feedback! Today I learned how difficult it is to make a trailer, I thought it was going to be easy but your right it doesn't come across as a very professional video.   It's my first time, there will be many more and hopefully the quality (in terms of content and presentation) will increase in time.   The original movie was captured at 1440 x 900 at 30 FPS using OBS. The resuling flv isn't too bad but the MP4 produced with movie maker (even at the highest quality) comes out like this. If you have any pointers on how to make good capture I'd love to know!  A couple of questions:   I should just leave the music attribution in the video description? (0:40) Yes I'm placing a crop field, when all the trees on it have been flagged to be cut I get the popup at the bottom of the screen to select the crop. Should I remove the caption there?    Thank you again! As I make more captures I'll try to make a better structured trailer. This is great advice!"
Unity3D,3df83z,Boss_Taurus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:50:06 2015 UTC,"Get actual HQ capture software and capture it at 60 fps. Otherwise there's no point in rendering the final video at 60 fps.  Also, get yourself some acquainted with some actual editing software, like adobe premiere. You don't make great video in windows movie maker. Its like trying to make art in MSpaint.  Now for your questions   Actually think for a second, when have you ever seen music credits in a trailer, let alone with the usage rights? Perhaps you should pay attention the next time you watch a trailer. A the very least it would be a mention in the margins briefly. No what I'm saying is the game doesn't look good enough, and things are shown too fast for that to be immediately apparent. Maybe show the crops growing rather than the plot of land that they'll grow on. Its like filming a vacant lot and calling it an apple orchard.   And sorry if I'm overly critical here. I just have an eye for these things and I let myself get a little swept away once I get going.  Edit Also I noticed you fade to black a lot. Stop that. There are better transitions that you could use. Fade to black means that you're ending something or trying to make a strong division. Here these slow fades actually cause for more visual distraction."

(it's something I looked into for a project but couldn't find any asset packs for).  The game looks fairly decent,first impression was the similarity to Banished. Other than the frame rate issue I would just slow it down a little,maybe do a timelapse style shot or 2 and tone down the green grass a lot as it's a bit jarring with the rest of the style."
Unity3D,3df83z,bagomints,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:44:45 2015 UTC,Hey there zeroberry! Thank you for the feedback! The building and wall placement systems were made by me. It's fairly straightforward I just create a path of nodes between the original position and the mouse position. At every node I place a wall piece according to the 2 neighboring nodes (straight wall or 90 degree angle). Once it's placed I combine every 40 wall piece into a single mesh in order to reduce draw calls.   Are you refering to the grass blades or the actual ground texture? (or both?)

Unity3D,3dh0p0,tgunter,3,Thu Jul 16 12:16:10 2015 UTC,"Looks like a lot of the other comments are mostly just giving you the code to do it, without actually explaining what you're doing.   The answer james_tea_ gave works, and is the correct way of going about it, but I think it's distracting from the answer a bit by messing around with getters and setters, which are nice, but not strictly relevant to the question you asked. Meanwhile the answer itsMeDOUG gave technically works, but is a bad and inefficient way of solving the problem that seems to derive from a lack of familiarity with the ""%"" operator.  The ""%"" is the modulus operator. It does integer division, but returns the remainder instead of the quotient.  So:  2098 % 100 == 98   ...because 2000 divides evenly into 100, but 98 does not. You can then subtract the resulting value from the original to get the split values you're requesting.  Now, the answer that itsMeDOUG gave will end up with the same result (but solving for the other part first), but it's doing several completely unnecessary steps to get there. It's converting an integer to a float, dividing by 100, converting it back to an integer, then multiplying it by 100. By using ""% 100"" you're pretty much just doing the divide by 100 step. With how fast computers are these days it probably won't affect performance a significant amount (unless you're doing this a ton of times per gamestep), but considering the modulus version is both simpler and more efficient, it's clearly the better choice.  Now, considering you didn't know this, I'm guessing you're not familiar with modulus, so I figure I'll share another really useful thing you can do with it:  Let's say you're iterating a value and want something to happen every nth time. That's very easy to do using the modulus operator. Just check to see if there's no remainder.  1 % 3 == 0; // evaluates false 2 % 3 == 0; // evaluates false 3 % 3 == 0; // evaluates true 4 % 3 == 0; // evaluates false 5 % 3 == 0; // evaluates false 6 % 3 == 0; // evaluates true"
Unity3D,3dh0p0,tgunter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:45:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to go in depth on modulus. You're correct in that I don't know anything about it, and in general, much about math I can't do on my hands, ha!  I read, somewhere, that % in unity isn't a ""real"" modulo and it's just ""remainder"". I don't know what that means. But I think I understand how % works in Unity/C#.  It's a division, then it throws away the ""whole"" parts and returns the remainder.   I don't need to get/set if I am passing a value in elsewhere in my code, ay?"

But I think I understand how % works in Unity/C#.   I'm guessing the point of contention you're referencing is that different languages handle negative values differently. Some keep the sign (positiveness/negativeness) of the dividend, some keep the sign of the divisor, some always have a positive result, etc. C# goes with the sign of the divisor.  That said, as long as you stick with positive numbers (which should be the majority of time), you shouldn't have to worry about it. Also, if you're checking for ==0 or !=0, it doesn't really matter what sign it's in.   I don't need to get/set if I am passing a value in elsewhere in my code, ay?   The get/set thing in james_tea_'s solution is a way of making sure that whenever IntA is updated, it automatically updates intA and intB. That said, there's some oddities in his code.   You normally only use getters and setters within a class definition, which was left out of the sample code. Normally you want to use public and private keywords to protect your class properties. As written, you can modify intA and intB directly and things will get out of sync. The function ""SetInteger"" as written takes an argument that it doesn't do anything with."

Unity3D,3dh0p0,nobono,2,Thu Jul 16 23:24:15 2015 UTC,"Unless you're doing concurrent programming with threads, you should be fine. A lot of programming is done as a series of function calls laid out sequentially. The functions will be run in that order, one before another. Your processor won't suddenly start working on call #2 if call #1 didn't return yet. Your processor's speed won't affect the order. It'll just affect how fast it goes through all the calls.  Its only when you start bringing threads into the equation that it starts getting hairy. When you're using threads, your processor can be doing multiple things at the same time. If both calls touch the same variable, then you could start running into some situations where one operation's result was overridden."

Like, I'm sure it's fine with 1 or 10 or maybe even 100 calls a second but I am unsure what exactly will happen if too many class are passed.   Depends on how computationally ""expensive"" the function in question is, and how many times it's being called. For the most part simple stuff like this isn't going to be a big problem, but if you have a bunch of inefficiencies in your program it can add up performance-wise.  While I will say that % is definitely the correct way to go over the floor solution, and you should generally use the more efficient option when known and available, I'll also say that you don't want to get hung up over small optimizations like that unless you've noticed a problem. There's an old saying in programming that ""premature optimization is the root of all evil"". This isn't to say you shouldn't worry about optimization, but the point is that it's better to work on optimizing the big bottlenecks in your program once you've figured out what they are than it is to waste your time on a bunch of small bottlenecks that ultimately don't matter that much.  Also, realize that most computers these days are capable of literally billions of operations per second. You can probably get away with more than you realize.   Will it mix up the order and return inaccurate results at some threshold? If so, is there a way to manage it?   What you're describing is called a ""race condition"", and for the most part is something you have to worry about with multithreaded programs, which you're probably not going to have to worry about. Your game logic is going to be running on a single thread, and that thread is only ever going to do one thing at a time before moving onto the next instruction.  What this means you do have to worry about is your update taking longer than your timestep to complete. If that happens your game needs to make up for lost time somehow. If you've ever played a game on a system that didn't quite meet the system requirements you probably know what it's like when that happens."

What if I made a unified version that the player and the computer could both use via polymorphism. Etc.  As for saving and loading, what exactly will I be saving and loading? Where will this data be stored? How will it be stored? How will it be written? Well it would be nice to stream data either off the disk or from a server. And I have preference, progression, status, text, sound, and multiple other assets that will be will need to be handled in this fashion. Etc.  I've got a Logitech controller for testing purposes. I can now set my keybindings, use the keyboard or controller for inputs, have the AI take control of other elements, and I can save all of that preference data for future use even outside of the editor.  And all that I just described can be used again and again, even if decide to change gears. I stared making a side-scrolling-shooter, and now I'm considering making an RPG, and I haven't had to touch any of that legacy code yet. Its my toolbox! :D"
Unity3D,3detom,Boss_Taurus,2,Thu Jul 16 02:04:53 2015 UTC,There needs to be a skeleton before you can put any meat on the bones. Fun player mechanics should be first priority in most cases before worrying about balancing/designing levels. You won't know how to design them until your mechanics are down.

I expand on that roughly, then start adding more rough stuff around to support it. Then keep chipping away until it's done :)  With Unity, it's pretty much the same thing. Start with whatever rough concept you want, then expand on that, add support and keep polishing.  Then, like any other art, keep whittling away the rough bits and polishing it until it's a giant polished turd."

Then I'll add player with 1 ability, to see how interaction with the room works, and after I'll add small enemy to see how he interacts with the player and the room and so on. After all ideas are working - only then I'll work on finishing each part, and adding more content."
Unity3D,3detom,Patomkin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:05:20 2015 UTC,"Create the mechanics through iterations working from the key ideas of the game that you likely put in the GDD. This should be done by the programmers, and give at the very least a working concept for the gameplay. This could be rocket jumping, rope swinging, interacting with doors etc. Have the level/game designers sit down with the GDD and figure out what sort of levels the game needs that would make use of the mechanics. A good game/level designer will use the mechanics to their fullest, and be sure to mix it up. If a mechanic is un-workable, remove it or tweak it if it's really wanted and interesting, then update the documentation so the programmers/gameplay people know. If your rocket jump needs to be timed for better height then make sure to include the timing values for the developers. Once everything is planned out for the design start prototyping the levels to a playable state making sure to show off the mechanics when they become available. Be sure that each level is solvable in its own way using the mechanics while recording feedback for the developers handling the mechanics development. If a jump isn't working correctly, identify if that is a level design issue or a gameplay design issue. Continue the above until everything is working as intended while updating the documentation as you go. Keep track of everything that is working or not to save headaches and cut down on last minute issues.   This is more or less how I work with team members. I'm by no means a professional and don't actually work in the industry on a professional level."
Unity3D,3detom,Samsquanch9,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:43:59 2015 UTC,"I do mostly software but the basic workflow is to identify the key features - I put advanced features and optional features to another list that I'll go through later. Once I have the broad strokes I start thinking about the system and key modules needed and how they plug into each other - usually I have to work on all of them at once because they depend on each other.. so the work is rather iterative. So rather than doing one module at a time I get a basic prototype up that works - I see if the design makes sense or if there are any issues. Then when a basic structure is in place it's easier to start working at whatever module I feel inspired to work on.   I'd imagine the basic process looks similar in other crafts - music, writing, etc. You want enough structure/scaffolding to keep things in place as you work on different parts - but not too much so it takes too much of your attention and it will get in your way. You'll also want to abstract/segment things etc. so you don't need to keep everything at mind at once.   I rarely have a complete vision of the project as I start - it unfolds as I work on the project. As such I find that I need to pace myself sometimes - pushing forward and rushing things can make things worse. As I hit a wall I need to take a break and let the thoughts/ideas ""incubate"", eventually I find a way forward.  Some software development principles I adhere to are:   KISS - keep it simple stupid, i.e. great solutions can be complicated but it doesn't mean complicated solutions are great - the simplest approach wins out most of the time - in terms of readability, maintainability, safety, extensibility, efficiency, etc.  YAGNI - you aren't gonna need it. Don't add stuff until you need it. Every line of code you add means more code to maintain, test, etc. code that will remain untested as your system grows (because it's not used). It just drains attention.   The best tool I have for the process is a simple TODO list were I keep things that need to be done - the most important ones at top and the optional things in a separate list. I also check things off and keep completed things in the list to keep me motivated and show the progress I'm making. It's also helpful when you get ideas for things you're not currently working on - just write it down in the list and it won't distract you."

I would in fact give everybody their own playground directory area within the project, and when they finish stuff they can move it into the main area of the project. keep as little as possible in the main scenes, and generally only have them reference prefabs push and merge frequently... no more of this ""go for three weeks without a commit"" type of silliness; nip that merge conflict right in the bud. exit Unity or else do a ""Save Project"" IN ADDITION TO ""Save Scene"" before you commit.

Unity3D,3derac,friendsKnowMyMain,2,Thu Jul 16 17:37:16 2015 UTC,"The most obvious is transitions. Almost every part of a game requires a transition, and if something is missing it without good reason it can often look bad. For example: if you pick an item up, it shouldn't just instantly disappear. Instead, the disappearance should be masked by a particle effect, or some other method to transition it out of the scene gracefully. The same goes for UI elements, changing levels, changing camera modes, pulling out weapons, movement, etc.  Another important thing is making sure all the artwork is consistent in terms of style and resolution, and doesn't contain any obvious bad UV mapping, no obvious repetition, etc.  There are basically a million different things you can polish, which is why it takes such a long time to do. Obviously no single item on this list is really going to make the difference between success and failure, but if the game as a whole lacks so many of these things then it's a good bet any potential customer or reviewer will see the poor production quality and stay away."

I check them out to find that one game with great polish that has failed (as in, has only 10-50 downloads and nobody seems interested in it). I have yet to see one.   People constantly say how the mobile market is too saturated and that it's pure luck to have a commercial success, but I think that some people confuse attention to detail with dumb luck. Sure, there are some huge commercial successes that look like they were crafted in MS Paint and some that seem like really simple concepts. It just doesn't mean that you'll get an instant hit if you combine poor aesthetics with a simple concept. It also doesn't mean bad luck if such a creation doesn't succeed.  There was a postmortem of Poly Bridge's Greenlight success on /r/gamedev (it got greenlit in a week or so) and it was such a beautiful game. I was ecstatic to see it reach the top of /r/gaming the other day. It just goes to show that when you have a beautifully crafted game, your ""luck"" stats all of a sudden go way up.

I personally can't fathom why someone would publish a game hoping for success when you can instantly spot glaring issues with the artwork or gameplay from the store screenshots or video. Or maybe people just become blind to it when it's their creation?  Also, if you want to look at a real graveyard for mobile games then check the Showcase board on the Unity forums, ouch!"

Also, people are free to express themselves in their own way and live up to their own standards.  There should be some kind of tags for people who are asking for feedback. Like a benchmark of sorts. There's a huge difference between judging a game jam entry and a game that wants to be the next Clash of Clans or Call of Duty. It's just impossible to know how that person sees their own creation. Then it's too late when they've already published in the hopes of becoming the next big thing and come back to say how they failed and can't understand why, because they thought it would be OK.

I like how the game Deadcore plays and the overall feel of it, also Drunken Robot Pornography is a style I kind of shoot for or am inspired by.

I was in remedial math in high school and I used to struggle with just getting simple character movement. This 3DBuzz Tutorial really opened my eyes and after this is when I got serious with Unity.   Also I really recommend starting from the beginning of these tutorials unity3dstudent and to even just quickly go through the basic ones to solidify stuff you might have missed, that's what I did. (keep in mind these tutorials don't take into account unity5 if you're using unity5, the coding may be slightly different at times)  Also please feel free to shoot me a specific question or whatever, ball dodging eh? So I assume character movement and 2d colliders/triggers? I'd love to take a look and see if I can help you achieve what you want in your game project."

Would you recommend a tutorial for that kind of thing?  I break up the meshes in Blender then import them into unity and apply my version of this guy's script to the pieces of the broken object. All the colliders are convex-mesh.  I told myself I'd start to really look at cpu performance in my games once I started noticing speed issues and I haven't yet."

My immediate suggestion would be to use sphere, capsule or box colliders (box being the most efficient on cpu/cuda cores) as they will gutter stomp mesh colliders in performance. You should try smashing say 5 enemies or more at the exact same time and then you'll see the performance hit. If you ever intend to do aoe style attacks/traps you will need to test performance of said effect with the max likely number of enemies that you may hit at one given moment. Try using the profiler while testing it to see how much of a spike you get. While your optimising it's a good idea to explode a bunch of them at the same time so the difference in results will be greater, this will give you a much better idea of how well your performance methods are working. Also consider using a script to force the rigid bodies into a sleep state after a timer so they don't keep calculating in update while your fighting other enemies"

Unity3D,3df909,Tug_Fugler,2,Thu Jul 16 16:47:51 2015 UTC,"Unreal has Actors, I have Characters.  Character script is the home of all of the Character Modules that can be added to a gameobject to give it specific behaviors. These character modules are based on an abstract class, CharacterModule. This abstract class simply holds a reference (finds it at runtime) to the Character script on the same gameobject. The Character class has a field for each type of Module so that any module can use the inherited behavior of the CharacterModule class to get the instance of the Character object to communicate with other modules on the same gameobject.   Modules:  For example, CharacterMortality gives a character health, health related functions, including the ability to die.  CharacterMovement is a custom character controller that has a bunch of tweakable fields (speed, jump height, etc) and a single function to Move.   Next we need a way to call that move function. We make two classes, PlayerInput for the player to get Input and use the results to call CharacterMovement.move. The second class is a CharacterAI script. This is an abstract class for every type of AI controller character to make an inheriting class from to decide how to call their CharacterMovement.move.  Finally an abstract CharacterAnimator script that can look at all of the other scripts to determine animation states.   So now making a character:  SkeletonDude:  Character, CharacterMortality, CharacterMovement, SkeletonAI (CharacterAI child class), SkeletonAnimator  Default state is to leave everything enabled.   But maybe a shaman casts an invincibility spell on the nearest skeleton. You can have a coroutine that simply disables the skeletons CharacterMortality behavior for X seconds and then reenables it.  You cast a stun spell on the Skeleton: disable the SkeletonAI script so that it can't provide input to the CharacterMovement script, which is left enabled so it can still react to gravity.  Or maybe you cast a freeze spell, disable the skeletons CharacterAnimator and the CharacterMovement scripts.   The ultimate goal is to make sure that there are no strict dependencies. That you could disable or remove any one of those modules from a character and you don't have errors being thrown. Everything should be able to function by itself, because of single responsibility."

There are concepts that they do not teach and an absolute beginner may be completely dumbfounded and have no idea what's going on.  I would NOT recommend paying the full price for the course as I think $250 could be better spent.  There's some issues here and there, and they have been working to fix some of them (they had to re-do an entire section) and they do regular updates as well - the course isn't even finished yet.  There's not a lot in terms of testing your knowledge as you go, with only a few very short quizzes here and there, but it's not enough to re-enforce to yourself that you are learning the concepts.    While it's been said that there are free resources out there, there may not be enough motivation to continue with anything that is offered freely - you can easily just drop it and give up or just forget about it.  It may also not be structured like a class, where you're learning based off of previously learned concepts.  Tutorials on how to do certain things is great, but it can be very beneficial to learn a solid foundation.  Personally, I feel that I've spent the $50 on the course so I should continue with it and get it done.  This course does do a fairly good job at teaching how Unity works so that you're able to build your own game. I have actually been having fun learning Unity and C#, and I look forward to going home after work and working further on the course.  Now, at a discounted price, it seems more reasonable.  The course does have a lot of content, and I've been chipping away at it now for a couple of weeks (~2-3 hours per weekday & 4-6 hours on the weekends), and I'm only about 60% of the way through it.  It is helpful in that they do try to challenge you, and they want you to pause the videos and try things out for yourself, so it's not just you watching them do everything.  They also push you to experiment and not just follow what they are doing - they would prefer if you made the games you'll be building in your own way with your own assets while implementing some of the items they are teaching.  Below is a link to something I've made while doing the course, which is a very basic 2D shooter.  They had provided enough knowledge by this point where I could expand my game into a full-on, multi-level, top-down shooter, but I decided to continue with the course rather than continuing to build upon this. http://gamebucket.io/game/4965caee-8737-4fbb-a030-4518f696bc5e  Even though it's basic, I find it strangely addicting."

Unity3D,3deu4e,JayOhhGames,2,Wed Jul 15 19:11:58 2015 UTC,"Shot in the dark here but:   Handle the hit on your player. Same way you detect that you can interact. In the interact method (where player press interact button) get the gameObject it's interacting with.  If the gameObject has a tag of ""Level Door"" (add this tag to all door objects) get reference to the script attached. Have a method inside of Door, that loads the appropriate level."
Unity3D,3deu4e,SymbolicProductions,2,Wed Jul 15 19:20:29 2015 UTC,"Good suggestion, but I would unify every interaction object into one script that handles everything that the player can interact with.  So you would have a script called 'Player_Interaction' inside this script you cast a ray that checks if the player finds a interaction object with tag 'Interaction' and then it would call on that objects script which would contain a function called DoFunction();   Do raycasting and input recognition on one script called for example 'Player_Interaction' For every interactable object you create have DoInteraction() function inside of it Call on DoInteraction inside the 'Player_Interaction' script   This way you don't have to create a tag for every Door, chests, lights etc."

That's not even alpha, it means that this is only a partial example of the final product.  Give the Unity WebGL team time to implement the rest of it, I'd advise waiting for a beta.  In the meantime, why are you using System.NET over the WWW or Network classes; the latter will be officially supported in WebGL.  Also NPAPI is still supported in all browsers except Chrome, and Chrome provides an optional extension for it.

Development started before network classes, also I'm more familiar with sockets.   Also NPAPI is still supported in all browsers except Chrome, and Chrome provides an optional extension for it. Most web-based unity apps still operating will link you to the official chrome extension if you're on that browser.   Yeah, and from the information I got Chrome will drop it completely in the next updates and I never heard of an actual extension that will NPAPI back. (Link?) Also, this will create a domino effect, so more browsers will start dropping NPAPI support.   You do know that the WebGL export is still in preview right? That's not even alpha, it means that this is only a partial example of the final product. Give the Unity WebGL team time to implement the rest of it, I'd advise waiting for a beta.   That's the thing. I would, I have to. But time is not on my side and things are happening out of order. It's not the webplayer will be phased out when WebGL is stable and usable. It's phased out before there's even an alpha. It's like falling between 2 chairs now."
Unity3D,3deo59,Tehelee,2,Wed Jul 15 18:36:29 2015 UTC,"My apologies, I thought Google had produced a NPAPI plugin. I misread the initial documentation to use their temporary workaround until Chrome 45.  If you take a look at Unity NPAPI usage statistics though, this seems really pointless, 10% usage 2 years ago, down to 2% last year, and most likely dead now.  http://blog.chromium.org/2014/05/update-on-npapi-deprecation.html  Feel free to take a look at the Unity WebGL roadmap: http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/webgl-roadmap.334408/  They state that the limitations in the WebGL export are from a lack of browser functionality and an early build of the IL2CPP compiler.  It seems that the timing is really just Chrome being the first to the plate again; NPAPI / Silverlight is microsoft's product and not one Google is responsible for.  WebGL offers a lot of features, and until other browsers implement more complete versions of WebGL we won't see the preview label removed from the Unity export. It's not something Unity can control or has dictated the time table of."
Unity3D,3deo59,Tehelee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:56:40 2015 UTC,"No harm done, the communication of the NPAPI debacle is not the best on either side.   WebGL offers a lot of features, and until other browsers implement more complete versions of WebGL we won't see the preview label removed from the Unity export. It's not something Unity can control or has dictated the time table of.   It also removed a lot of features, like sockets and is still only GL ES 2.0. It's not the full unity experience and it's held back by browser implementations. With that kind of arguments your alarm bells should be ringing. WebGL is a step backwards and not a solution.  What we need is a native browser plugin to NOT be held back by browser implementations that still works in all browsers, implemented in their own versions. Chrome would be PPAPI.  To describe where I'm coming from: When I quit my job I said: ""God I'm glad to never ever have to worry about browsers again."" Their way of doing business is hellish. Everything is bound to change, things get obsolete, new technologies don't work for ages or ever. There are also so many browsers and versions you have to cover, each with their own little quirks.  With the unity webplayer you don't have these issues. You're in your sandbox that works everywhere the same.  NPAPI is also a netscape relic. Nothing to do with microsoft, they roled their own version of it. Google has it's own version PPAPI, which maybe explains the sudden drop of NPAPI.  And the way unity handles this right now, they don't even have a sub forum for webplayer anymore."
Unity3D,3deo59,Zeroto,3,Wed Jul 15 19:25:29 2015 UTC,"Well Firefox has now marked plugins in general as legacy, (effectively killing their support of NPAPI as a result). With this kind of attitude it may be hard to do anything new universally.  Right now the best shot is WebGL. It may not have all we want, or when we want it, but it's the best universal solution to provide the capability Unity needs.  The hope is moving forward we can improve the framework to support everyone's needs, rather than being by NPAPI.  Chrome and Firefox are moving to support it, and hopefully others will follow suit. It's certainly not the answer you're looking for but its the only chance at the moment for a powerful and universal framework for all browsers and platforms.  Don't get me wrong, Chromes early cancellation of NPAPI is disheartening, but it's still just bad timing between Unity and Chrome.

Unity3D,3dcevb,ArmiReddit,2,Wed Jul 15 19:37:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's cute! But it does need more polish.  I don't know if it's because I somehow now associate muted colors and pastels with low poly objects, but the bright colors kind of bother me. It could also be that the colors are everywhere, and everything is sharp (including the background), so my brain doesn't know where to focus. Also, the more I look at it, the more it feels like the emphasis from the shark is taken away, as everything else is so bright. I think the shark is funny, but it doesn't seem like an important event, because it's the least emphasized element in the scene.  I'm also not fond of the UI elements. I like the numbers, but the blue background doesn't look that good. Same for the lower left corner element. I don't like the background and the pause button is too ""thin"" for such a big element. Does that make sense? Since the numbers in the upper right corner are so chunky, the pause button looks mismatched.  Please note that this is just the criticism for the elements that bother me personally, and I think that in general it looks really cute and the concept is cute, and to me cute is a very positive thing!"
Unity3D,3dcevb,emotiontheory,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:08:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the honest feedback, its appreciated. The game has only been play tested amongst family and friends so sometimes its hard to get honest/brutal feedback.  I completely understand the comments regarding the UI elements. They are placeholders until I work out something better, but you make good points regardless.  The colour scheme is subtly altered through the gif compression and personally I think it looks a lot better in game, but I think I understand your point, too many colours makes for a busy screen.  I've been trying to develop a distinctive look for the game and perhaps gone a little overboard. This is the first time I've built a ""professional"" app."
Unity3D,3dcevb,ArmiReddit,2,Wed Jul 15 08:22:45 2015 UTC,"You know what would be perfect (in response to making the shark more dramatic)? Let the camera zoom in a little bit and give it some screen shake.  That should really make it feel visceral, maybe even give a slight shock to the player - like OH!, but in a good way ;)  Personally I think you're on the right track. You def need polish, but that's the fun part where you get to just add lots of little details here and there to make everything more juicy and give it more pop!"
Unity3D,3dcevb,ArmiReddit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:05:46 2015 UTC,"The shark attack definitely is lacking a bit of punch! I'll mess around with camera shake although I'm not sure about the zoom. I used to zoom in and out depending on the speed of the character but it has a tendency to break the parallax effect. I'll give it a try tho, can't hurt. Thanks for the comment!

Unity3D,3dcevb,ArmiReddit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:35:41 2015 UTC,"The gif was rather short, so it's difficult to get the whole picture.

In the end I do think that it's the attention to details that will set apart the professional games from the rest, so spending time on polishing the game is a good investment. IMHO."

Unity3D,3dcevb,devluz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:31:58 2015 UTC,"It is, yes. The picture still looks kind of busy, but that's probably partly due to it being limited in view and not really focused on anything in particular.  Are you going to switch the light blue sky into something with a bit more depth? Not a lot more stuff, but right now it looks like a flat surface (like the green screen in a studio) as opposed to a sky."
Unity3D,3dcevb,mdet39i4,2,Wed Jul 15 16:37:19 2015 UTC,"I hadn't considered adding anything else to the blue sky. If you go high enough the moon rises and fills the screen. I could try having more cloud filler in the background before that happens.  It does look a bit sparse when you get high up and the last background gets low.   I've also been toying with adding a 'dust' particle effect that slides across the screen relative to your movement. We have 50 different themed characters so the thought was to make each particle specific to the character. Just performance and making things too busy has been making me hesitate. Can't hurt to try though.   Thanks for taking the time and replying, I appreciate it."

Unity3D,3dcizl,baconost,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:24:55 2015 UTC,"Alright since I'm bad at explaining things I'll just explain how would I use it. So first of all, create a Vector3, which should be like player.gameObject.transform.position - taget.gameObject.transform.position, so in the end you will get a sum. Then inside an if you check if the the Vector3.magniute <= number), so the .magnitude is a generated float which we can say uses all of It's axis to generate a number which is a a point from player to the target. So let's say you can test our the number variable to 2 so it should look like if(myVector3.magnitue <= 2){ do something}, if you didn't understand something please message me, I'm very bad at explaining things but i try my best haha !"

I didn't want to use the physic's engine to move the door as I want it to open as you approach. Each door in my game will only open if you have a certain amount of X resource.

Unity3D,3dc7lv,This_is_so_fun,2,Wed Jul 15 05:47:29 2015 UTC,i'm actually having trouble right now with animation state based collider making/enabling... Like I can't seem to put a collider on a sword when it is swinging. any advice for that? What method did you use to tell when the animator controller was in a certain state at run time? Or did you use bools?
Unity3D,3dc7lv,DoctorAnger,2,Wed Jul 15 06:16:02 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not using unity colliders for my engine, but I'd imagine you'd be able to add a collider object to the sword as a child.  As for the animation, I have a state for every animation that I use, but the logic for which one to play is handled through a different logic system. Basically my move system just tells the animator which animation to play and at what speed, then it handles what happens after that on its own."
Unity3D,3dc7lv,DoctorAnger,2,Wed Jul 15 06:27:50 2015 UTC,Looks great! How does it handle the two players trading blows back and forth?

Unity3D,3de45t,CrazyNoa,2,Wed Jul 15 15:40:19 2015 UTC,"About the network : Maybe you don't NEED to sync the position of flying ennemies. I mean, if I play with a friend, all I can say to him is ""Look, I am a big warrior, I made 50 ennemies fly away in one single shot !"". We won't need to compare the positions of the flying ennemies. If, after hitting the ground, they stay alive and come back to us, then yes you need synchronisation, but if not, you can just set them to fly in random directions, the players won't care about that...  About Steam : NEVER try to implement Steam before your game has been greenlighted. It's useless, and you just can't (Steam only allow access to their API to the greenlighted games, so this is just useless to try it before) And don't worry, it will take some time but the Steam API is made very easy to understand. A total newbie could use it in less than a week :)  Good luck, and if you want more precision for network I need more infos :p"
Unity3D,3de45t,WeAreBots,2,Wed Jul 15 18:07:36 2015 UTC,"That was exactly what I needed. I've been thinking about the physics thing, and I'll probably do something like you suggested. They do get up, but the flying around-thing is mostly aesthetic. I might be able to get away with giving the client authority and only syncing position data a few times per second to the server/other players. Perhaps I could even have each client calculate the rotations themselves. It's a silly fun type of game, so we probably don't need to worry too much about that stuff. It's really great to hear that the Steam stuff is late in the cycle and easy to use too. I was worried that we might have missed something important and screwed ourselves over. I feel much more confident about continuing now. Once again, thanks a lot! I'll make sure to post about the game here in the sub when we're ready to show it."

Unity3D,3dd6ji,deadmanjw,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:19:31 2015 UTC,When you create elements you can basically reference them in your script so for example a menu I might have a panel with some Text elements on it. In my script I would then declare a public GameObject and assign the panel to that object. I can then call .SetActive() to make it visible or not.

I thought things would become better with the new uGUI system (since version 4.6), but to no avail.  The problem is that Unity doesn't offer a high-performace, simple to use, 2D system for its GUI. Practically, 90% of all UI stuff is 2D, i.e. no need for anything fancy, and the new GUI system should have reflected that by mimicking easy to use, high performance, WinForms alternatives that aren't built up by 100s of game objects.  I know this rant is of no help for you, but I'm wondering if it's possible to have Unity - or others - to focus on a much leaner 2D GUI approach. If that's even possible by the way Unity is built up around game objects, that is...  EDIT: I already have an NGUI license, and seeing that the library is still maintained, I wonder if it's any better."
Unity3D,3dbu25,SamtheSpartan,2,Wed Jul 15 01:33:15 2015 UTC,Triggers can work wonders for this. Just have the OnTriggerEnter/OnTriggerStay call toggle a bool when the target is in range which will Raycast to ensure the target is visible or not. I've done this before with almost no impact to performance. Could always run coroutines every set seconds as well if you didn't want a check every frame.
Unity3D,3dbu25,Samsquanch9,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:04:05 2015 UTC,Why not first check the distance between the player and the enemy then if it is within a certain range you can check the vision angle?
Unity3D,3dbu25,bodaciousMike,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:36:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll probably do something like that. If there is something between the object and the player I need it to be considered 'not-visible' so I'll probably use raycasts at that point.
Unity3D,3dbu25,nobono,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:41:23 2015 UTC,"I solve something similar by having all the checking run in a background thread. Not much overhead and the ""game thread"" runs without any performace degradation."

Unity3D,3dbu25,mrbonk71,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:54:07 2015 UTC,"I was tinkering with something similar recently and I used a couple of things to keep track of who could see what etc. First thing I did was use the spherical collider check, that returns all of the colliders within a spherical volume around a particular point (my player). Then, once I established which objects were within range, I eliminated the ones that were outside the field of view. The resulting collection was then tested with a raycast, to determine if they were in 'view', or occluded.  Hope this helps :)"
Unity3D,3dbu25,mrbonk71,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:00:36 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a great solution! I tried just using raycasts and while the few objects I had didn't drastically reduce performance, I could see it getting messy with a larger scene. The series of checks you suggest reduces the number of casting objects significantly. Thanks!"
Unity3D,3dbu25,huntergatherer1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:22:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, it was the same for me. I could see it quickly becoming unwieldy with so much raycasting going on. At least with the spherical collider check and the FOV check, you end up with a significantly smaller collection to then expend your raycast enerygy on. It worked particularly well for me, because I had a lot of moving objects in the scene that could block each other from view."
Unity3D,3dbu25,KptEmreU,0,Thu Jul 16 04:41:10 2015 UTC,"I dont think raycasts would cause a noticeable impact if you only target the right layers, cast every few frames as opposed to everyone, and make the checking run in a separate thread, as nobono said."
Unity3D,3dbu25,UNITiS_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:07:28 2015 UTC,"Ok probably very noobish question but when u use co-routines to slow down a process does it make any difference? because at the end it has to be counting time(and doing stuff) for the right moment isn't it? And when it executes its code it still should finish in a 1 update frame right?  Ah but with coroutine you can check for close game objects in 1 line store them, wait for 1 frame, cast rays from objects, store hit.tags , wait for 1 frame and check if any hit.tags == player...  So you can spread your code into 3 frames. Is this how it should work? (Because I have never did it like this before but kinda theoretically makes sense)  Edit: I tried to read some about threading but discouraged by -it is better left to pros- comments.. :P"

Unity3D,3da6py,Chris1mmortal,2,Tue Jul 14 18:23:42 2015 UTC,"There were some decent changes in Unity 5. Some of it can be fixed automatically when you open your project in Unity 5 where it runs an automated script to do some code conversions (you should always make a backup before this). But even with the automated script there will still probably be some changes you have to make.  Just so you are aware, even the WebGL in Unity 5 is still considered a ""Preview"" and not an officially supported platform for Unity yet because it is still in development. Some games have successfully been completed with it though so it is possible.  There are some current annoyances with it though where one of them being that the build times for WebGL are insanely long so testing can be a huge nuisance.  How long have you been working on this game? AFAIK NPAPI support has only been removed from Chrome (and it's been removed for some time now, surprised you haven't noticed?). The other browsers still support it but most likely they will remove support eventually as well.  If you've invested a lot of time and effort into this game, I honestly suggest you do convert to Unity 5. You probably won't use the new features (unless you were using Unity Free before) but you're going to be stuck without it. I remember converting my project and getting all these errors right away which seemed too much to manually fix, but after just chugging away at it I ended up cleaning it up in a decent amount of time."
Unity3D,3da6py,leuthil,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:29:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!  I guess it's possibility 3 then, the ""What did Unity 5 change?"" grind :(  I've been working on this game since roughly the beginning of senior year of high school (so like September 2015 ish) and I didn't really keep up with the news such as the NPAPI thing because I always just took the Web Player for granted and assumed it would be there for me when I finished the game.  Now I've finished and started looking into the final build stuff and gotten slapped by reality.  My problem with updating to Unity 5 is I'm actually not getting errors.  Not a single error message.  Things just don't work anymore.  An if statement within OnTriggerEnter is reacting differently when I change the function to OnTriggerStay (and it's just checking what the collider is!)  Controller.velocity doesn't seem to be working.  Stuff that was working fine for me in 4.6 suddenly stops, and it's incredibly frustrating.  And it's not like I'm gonna get any significant ad revenue or thousands of plays if I put in the work to fix it...I just thought it would be really cool to just be able to send people a link to my game and embed it in my website."
Unity3D,3da6py,Tehelee,2,Tue Jul 14 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"You're being very vague about the erroneous behaviors you're experiencing, but I'll try to help with what you've posted.  OnTriggerEnter is still a valid MonoBehaviour method in 5.0, and has always behaved differently to OnTriggerStay. Is there a reason you're changing it?  Also I don't see a native UnityEngine class called Controller. Is that a custom script?  Most changes from Unity 4.6+ to Unity 5 are a just few variables renamed; no core functionality has changed.  I'd advise looking at your scene and ensuring all inspector references are assigned to your specs. I've had the upgrade mangle some of my scenes, including tag and layer changes, physic layer setting reset, and lots of unassigned references on my custom scripts.  I hope you can pin down the issues you're experiencing, it can be hard if you don't know where to start."
Unity3D,3da6py,leuthil,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:55:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  I was just comparing OnTriggerEnter to OnTriggerStay because I changed ""Stay"" to ""Enter"" just to see what would happen and I ended up completely baffled.  As for the Controller thing, what I really meant was CharacterController (my instance of it was called controller so I mixed it up in my post).  Basically I was using CharacterController.velocity to check my character's speed...in Unity 5 it just returns 0,0,0 no matter what.  I'll keep looking into the inspector to see if anything got screwed up but it looks like my layers stayed intact.  I did have to rebake the nav meshes but everything else looks fine.  Just those two mysterious script errors that I haven't been able to pin down.  I might just build for web player with my working 4.6 game see how many people play my game until Web Player support is completely gone.  I suspect the number of people trying my game on Kongregate will fall off significantly after a month or so anyway so it's not a big deal if the game is eventually non-playable online."
Unity3D,3da6py,leuthil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:04:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah I had some strange behaviour like that too where there were no errors but something was definitely glitched. I had one prototype that I thought would be fun to convert to WebGL just to show my friends and it just came up as a blank screen lol. I never took the time to fix it.  Physics stuff should still be working. You will have to do a bunch of debug statements and stuff to figure out what's going on. If you can, try to compare your objects/prefabs and collision matrix side-by-side with your old Unity 4.6 project and your new Unity 5 project. You should be able to keep both Unity installs on your computer at the same time I think.  The biggest change that they did was remove quick accessors such as gameObject.collider or gameObject.renderer. I believe everything except for .transform has to be retrieved like any other component through .GetComponent<Object>(). That being said the automated script that Unity 5 runs when it converts your project should automatically do the replacement for you (although inefficiently by just replacing .collider with .GetComponent<Collider>())."

My solution would be for the skill itself to parse the json data when it needs it and it just assumes that it's the correct format, rather than the base class. Not sure if that's the right path, though.  Also, I'm assuming this is a mobile game. I remember people (and Google) saying that there are a lot of issues with LINQ and mobile devices. I noticed you're using it, is it working fine for you?"

Unity3D,3d8jlr,Darks1de,7,Tue Jul 14 09:57:40 2015 UTC,"Getting better, still no real need for artist portfolios though. They, despite listing it, do not use Unity on average at all. There are plenty of magazines that cover that scene, eg. 3D Artist, etc.  Unitys main function is coding, this is what game coders do all day with it, C# mainly, to ignore this, almost completely is beyond me. The magazine still is upside down IMHO. It should be 90% coding, tutorials, theory, tips, applied knowledge, techniques, users questions.  What I did like. Shaders article, very nice. Studio interviews.  It needs...  Unity Store asset reviews. This is such an obvious one."
Unity3D,3d8jlr,Bigsoftier,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:51:37 2015 UTC,"I disagree. If it was 90% coding, I'd skip it altogether and I'm an artist who is into c#."

Unity3D,3d8jlr,bagomints,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:42:06 2015 UTC,"One big reason for the portfolios is for artists to use it as a sounding board and potentially get new work.  I'd love to get more artists on board, possibly even have a directory for artists, studios, etc to either offer or contract work :D  As for using Unity, that is a must.  We've had to reject a few artists because their work was Unreal (no pun intended :D).  Artists have to be working / publishing with Unity to be featured.  I'd also love to see more games / small studios featured.  The interview next month should set the world on fire, a young dev made good through gamejams and now has his own studio!! Stay tuned"
Unity3D,3d8jlr,baadaa2000,3,Mon Jul 20 21:40:26 2015 UTC,"The shader periodical is so great. You need to have this be a thing in each issue, or if it's not a shader, it should be some kind of practical tutorial of some kind, but I'm so sure everybody interested in Unity (as an artist or programmer) would greatly appreciate the shader articles because it applies to both of them, so you can't go wrong if you include shaders in each issue.  I like that you showcase people's work, it's a nice gesture. But I think you should include something practical alongside artist showcases or something, like an article detailing techniques within Unity, something along those lines. Otherwise, it's just fluff without any practical use.  I don't think people reading your magazine are doing it just to look at the pretty pictures, they want to get something out of it."

Unity3D,3d8p24,AxlJones,2,Tue Jul 14 13:14:34 2015 UTC,Looks nice. I have always wanted to make a good building system... but have never got round to it. I was wondering do you have to assign snapping points yourself? or does it figure it all out by itself?
Unity3D,3d8p24,AxlJones,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:34:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you, there are no snapping points, more a grid, the grid can be changed in inspector so you can make objects snap every 8 meters, every 1 meter or 0.001 of a meter.  This gives you control over how rigid or flexible your placement of building modules is.  The way that it does the placement check is:  Checks for intersections - Is the placement mesh intersecting with any other building sections?.  This works for most things but for walls and ceilings that need pillars there is also a pillar check.  The pillar check is optional but if a wall doesn't have a pillar either side or a ceilings doesn't have one in each corner then it will make the building section unplaceable.  Doors and Windows (Not in video but coming in next update) also do intersection checks but also there are points in the walls where doors can be placed and where  can be placed also.  If they snap to one of these points and are not intersecting they will be placeable.  The prop tool can be used for placing props and also does an intersection check.  Props can either be a Floor, Wall or Ceiling Prop.  For instance paintings can be placed on walls but not on the floor or ceiling and a table can only be placed on the floor.  The way this works is by checking the normal angle of the raycast hit info and determining whether it is a wall, ceiling or a floor etc."
Unity3D,3d8p24,eliasar,2,Tue Jul 14 19:39:39 2015 UTC,"Needs something like prefabs.  It would be nice if you could create a complex object like an entire floor of a building, and then duplicate that.  Would save you from adding each wall/staircase/floor for each level."

Unity3D,3d9q7h,NotActuallyIgnorant,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:14:37 2015 UTC,They do stick to anything that has a collider attached to it. However they don't warp. I suppose you could switch out the mesh to say a projector. The projector would be able to warp around the mesh.

Unity3D,3d9q7h,AxlJones,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:46:19 2015 UTC,In networking what happens is that the blood droplets are randomized so the result is client side only. However it spawns in the same position and rotation so it shouldn't differ by much. Theoretically you could synchronize the blood stains but I don't see why you would need to do this. And no you aren't too late. The 20th is the last day!

Unity3D,3d9mow,notrorschach,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:50:59 2015 UTC,"No, You don't need to have a copy of the assets for every resolution. Although you must make sure that your UI scales and fits every resolution. So you might want to check the multiple resolutions (top left of the game window).   If you're using the Unity UI canvas system for your UI, use anchor points and make sure that the UI Scale Mode in Canvas Scaler component of the canvas is set to ""Scale with screen size"". Tweak around with other options to get a balanced canvas for the screen of any resolution.  These are my settings for iPhone builds. It should work for all resolutions although you might need to make some adjustments for the iPad resolutions.  Checkout this and the official Unity tutorial on 4.6 UI for more information regarding scaling and stuff.  Everything other than the UI should work fine on all the resolutions. iPads are wider so you might want to play and check your game on the newer iPhones 6, 6+ and iPad resolutions to get an idea on how the game looks like.

Unity3D,3dbmr7,LordNode,2,Wed Jul 15 02:42:32 2015 UTC,"voxel models + pixel fonts = Crossy Road ripoff   No.  Almost everything about your game screams ripoff:   Character select screen has all the characters lined up Character select screen has the same camera angle and projection Character select screen has characters rotating (though slightly different) Before gameplay you have a kind of scene to view the character and change it, etc The gameplay looks to be almost identical with the one/few inputs to progress along the level The gameplay has the exact same isometric camera setup the gameplay has the same replay thing, similar death scenario, UI features, etc   If you want to make a game like Crossy Roads for practice then great, go for it. Just remember that the main difference between your game and theirs right now is that the level of polish in their game is astronomical. You might think your game is a few days off being similar to theirs and they just got lucky to hit it big, but in reality you've only put in 1% of the work required to get the game itself as good as theirs, and even then I don't think your physics based death scenario has any potential, and it looks pretty frustrating for casual players.

When I have, I can't see the ray at all, but as you can see from my prints, rayStart is nevertheless set to the correct value.   I hadn't heard of magic numbers, but I just looked it up and it seems that I've used them when setting rayStart. Would that be correct? Are there any other magic numbers I've used here that could be problematic?  For reference, the values in rayStart get a point directly in front of the player, at head height, and the ray is cast down from there to hit anything in front of them. The player is .64 high.  I've added in else as follows, but it hasn't changed a thing:                  if (playerFacing == ""N"")                     rayStart = new Vector3 (transform.position.x, transform.position.y + .64f, transform.position.z - .16f);                 else                 if (playerFacing == ""S"")                     rayStart = new Vector3 (transform.position.x, transform.position.y + .64f, transform.position.z + .16f);                 else                 if (playerFacing == ""E"")                     rayStart = new Vector3 (transform.position.x - .16f, transform.position.y + .64f, transform.position.z);                 else                 if (playerFacing == ""W"")                     rayStart = new Vector3 (transform.position.x + .16f, transform.position.y + .64f, transform.position.z);                 if (!inDialogue)             {                 if (Input.GetKey (KeyCode.A)) {                     input = new Vector3 (-maxSpeed, 0, input.z);                     playerFacing = ""E"";                     anim.SetInteger (""Direction"", 1);                     anim.SetBool (""isWalking"", true);                 }                 else                 if (Input.GetKey (KeyCode.D)) {                     input = new Vector3 (maxSpeed, 0, input.z);                     playerFacing = ""W"";                     anim.SetInteger (""Direction"", 3);                     anim.SetBool (""isWalking"", true);                 }                 else                 if (!Input.GetKey (KeyCode.A) && (!Input.GetKey (KeyCode.D)))                 {                     input = new Vector3 (0, 0, input.z);                 }                   if (Input.GetKey (KeyCode.W)) {                     input = new Vector3 (input.x, 0, maxSpeed);                     playerFacing = ""S"";                     anim.SetInteger (""Direction"", 2);                     anim.SetBool (""isWalking"", true);                 }                 else                 if (Input.GetKey (KeyCode.S)) {                     input = new Vector3 (input.x, 0, -maxSpeed);                     playerFacing = ""N"";                     anim.SetInteger (""Direction"", 0);                     anim.SetBool (""isWalking"", true);                 }                 else                 if (!Input.GetKey (KeyCode.W) && (!Input.GetKey (KeyCode.S)))                 {                     input = new Vector3 (input.x, 0, 0);                 }                  if (!Input.GetKey (KeyCode.W) && !Input.GetKey (KeyCode.A) && !Input.GetKey (KeyCode.S) && !Input.GetKey (KeyCode.D))                 {                     anim.SetBool (""isWalking"", false);                 }             }"

However, your drawn ray is not using the same parameters as the raycast: different lengths and faceFwd does not necessarily equal Vector3.down from what I can see."
Unity3D,3d8cmj,IAMApsychopathAMA,3,Tue Jul 14 08:23:49 2015 UTC,How does it look on your canvas? In scene you can see there is a canvas (the big transparent rectangle with white borders). Zoom out and see if the text is on there. Can you put other things on canvas like panels? Also the canvas settings would be nice to see.
Unity3D,3d8cmj,Molehole,2,Tue Jul 14 08:45:50 2015 UTC,"Try changing the horizontal and vertical overflow values to ""Overflow"". Possible cause is that your text object area is too small for the actual content so it gets hidden."
Unity3D,3d8cmj,Varakk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:37:30 2015 UTC,Can we get a look at your canvas inspector? It's likely the problem is there.
Unity3D,3d8cmj,ImaMofoCat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:09:23 2015 UTC,I was just following the roll a ball game tutorial and clicked create>UI>text so shouldn't it be default? Still screenshot coming.

Unity3D,3d8cmj,nonathaj,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:57:19 2015 UTC,"Could be the Canvas is not set to one of the ""Screen Space"" modes.  Could be the text is physically off the edge of the canvas (based on that Pos Y and the size of your game tab, this seems most likely).  Could be the Canvas Scaler script has a non-one Scale Factor."
Unity3D,3d8cmj,Canazza,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:36:10 2015 UTC,"Do you have a camera set to render the UI layer? It looks like you've got the canvas set to world space. Click the text, and press F, it'll zoom/pan to display it in the scene window."
Unity3D,3d8cmj,AnvilofSpinning,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:47:05 2015 UTC,Because your height should be bigger than 30. If your width and height are too small and your font size too big you won't see anything.
Unity3D,3d8cmj,eliasar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:23:09 2015 UTC,"/u/IAMApsychopathAMA: also, the scaling of the canvas. It might be too large."

Unity3D,3d92xe,Igneom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:22:14 2015 UTC,"I have tested it on iPAD2, iPAD4, iPAD mini 2 and all have the same issue. On the other hand, all iphones works better, and there no sign of this bug. Looks something in iPAD version of the game, but didn't know what is exactly wrong..."
Unity3D,3d92xe,Igneom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:19:35 2015 UTC,"If you have code that is exclusive for the ipad, it's the first place to check, it could also be something graphical since ipads have a bigger screen and something on the UI or similar is causing it, if nothing works, could be a bug on unity."
