wargame,3e3ztr,AdwokatDiabel,11,Tue Jul 21 19:54:43 2015 UTC,Play Red Dragons Motorized it's actually really competitive and a lot of fun to play as not to mention it is probably the best Red Dragons Deck specialization to choose even over general. Look into the last couple weeks on the deck building thread and your sure to find some red dragons decks and the advice they were given.  Also look up Firestarter Wargame on YouTube. He's a really good red dragons moto player and post lots of 1v1s as well as some 2v2-4v4s using almost exclusively red dragons moto.
wargame,3e3ztr,ScopionSniper,7,Tue Jul 21 20:20:49 2015 UTC,"China, and Red Dragons are factions that excel in smaller games. They lack certain unit types that makes them weaker in bigger games, but in the other hand they have some excellent low-end units that makes them great in 1vs1 ranked and such. Motorized is generally speaking the way to go as RD - you don't get access to superheavies and such but you really don't need them either in ranked. Also the faction loses quite few relevant units if you choose this path.  Key points - good wheeled transports. Cheap and many of them come up with autocannons. Lots of carbines which will chew infantry in cities. Li-Jian '90+Yuckjeondae '90 combo is very similar to Spetsnaz + VDV '90, except worse rocket launcher but a lot more infantry-killing power. You can also use the marines instead of Yucks. No ATGM infantry (Fagot's are toys not ATGM's) but Tanke Shashou is a solid 1400m recoilless rifle - good against transports and infantry.  Support! Artillery choices are quite bad, use 5HE mortars. Koksan is also pretty good. Rocket artillery sucks, don't even bother. PGZ-95 and HQ-7 (Crotale) are both amazing. Also, non-radar Shilka will chew helis and planes if they come at range  Tanks - lots of very good Chinese medium tanks, which are better than their Soviet counterparts. They are extremely solid workhorses.  Recon tab comes up with Lie-Ren, which are decent shock recon. The real gem of this tab is the recon tank - ZTQ-62G. It has very good optics, good gun, okay armor and medium stealth - it is very hard to spot from a forest hedgeline.  The treasure of the vehicle tank is the 65pt tank destroyer. It has 21AP, making it a serious threat even against the heaviest tanks. That and ZTQ are the reasons why RD moto is so good - they come up with the best tanks. Just be sure that you don't get shot first.  On the heli tab you get Z-9A TY-90, the best AA helo in the game as it has 6HE rockets and you get four EIGHT of them. These should grant an air superiority in the openers. MI-25 is also a great gunship as it costs only 65 points - can't deal with heavy stuff though.  On the air tab you get an excellent 1000kg bomber for 80 points and a Q-5D with its laser-guided bombs - these will wreck both tanks and infantry. Also, B-5. ASF's are pretty shite though, nothing remarkable in the low-end and SU-25SK is just too shite for 150 points.  As mentioned, RD is very good in small games, especially if you go motorized. Go watch Firestarter's channel to see how it's played."

wargame,3e3ztr,thegoldelite,6,Tue Jul 21 23:12:07 2015 UTC,"The good stuff:   ZTQ 62G - Normal 60 pt tank with a big twist: Medium stealth and very good optics. Best armored vehicle in the game under 100pts. TY90 - Best AA Heli in the game; I win 10% of my ranked games because I win a big heli battle. Lie Ren in Z9A can follow up and drop strategic points. Q-5D - Only laserguided bomber on REDFOR PTZ-89 - High Ap Tank destroyer. Also available in Motorized. Infantry choice - Red Dragon has a good infantry tab with lots of choice. Cheap transports - If you meatgrind in a city you want 5pt or 10pt transport; red dragon has the 10pt 150km/h BTR60P. The Wz-551 is a good autocannon for only 5pts more. Heli Spam - Mi-25 gives 10HP for 60 pts. You get 10 per card and can supplement with transport helis (like the cheap Mi-8). If your opponent uses missiles he will likely run out of missiles before halting a spam push. If he uses SPAAG the Mi-25 can return fire very well. Full featured Anti Air and Tank tab and bomber   The bad:   No good artillery ( the koksan and mortars is the only workable piece Bad ASF and awful SEAD Different Anti Tank strategies. You dont have ATGM bomber or Konkurs Infantry, you must ambush the opponent on close range.   The most popular specialization are motorized. You lose the heavy tanks and both marines; you gain 2 infantry slots, more activation points and experience. RD Motorized can deal with heavy tanks with the PTZ-89 and stealthy tank shots from the side. Mechanized gets outclassed by eastern block, armored by the soviets. Marines are a barely viable fun deck or a passable alternative if you want 7 naval cards.  You should always play Red Dragon instead of pure China. In a specialised deck you have enough points so the extra hit doesnt matter. In a general deck you can easily get 5 planes and 5 infantry and enough of the rest. If you play pure china you gain extra points and basically gain more tanks (china doesnt have enough heavy tanks to make use of 4+ tank cards) and more support (china doesnt have artillery so not useful) and the 5th card of recon (which is nice but again you dont have that many good choices). North Korea gives you the B5 (Gift of glorious leader) AND YeoGockDae/YuckYoenDae in wheeled transport AND the T90 AND some other goodies."

Your special forces might die to his strike so remeber to always keep them moving, even brake contact from time to time. The forest and the enemy will still be there, no need to rush, with elite inf you lead the tango because of their speed. Also keep some supply truck close back and rotate blobs when necessary. The enemy will try to counter your SF with MG3 spam, but Dear Leader will bless their efforts from above, tactical nucular style.

wargame,3e3ztr,Henry4athene,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:32 2015 UTC,"I play China almost exclusively when playing redfor.   They have a lot of good units. Chinese marines are among the best marines, with one of the best anti-tank weapons and a decent selection of transports. Zanshi are weak, but extremely spammable, as is the case with most line infantry. Li Jian 90 are amazingly effective. Their tanks after the rebalance are among the best within their price brackets (the ZTZ-85-III is outright better than the equivalent M1 Abrams, the M1A1 HA) and they even get what amounts to a stealth sniper tank. Their anti-air is top-tier, despite the fact that it doesn't have a particularly large number of units, with one of my favorite IR anti-air (crotale) and a good long-range missile (the HQ-91 I believe) as well as what is almost a Tunguska clone (PGZ-95).  Their armor lacks a super-heavy, so you can't expect to compete against M1A2 or Challengers in an out and out fight. Their air power is a bit lackluster, as they have only one really viable ASF (the Su-27SK, which is basically an Su-27S clone) and pretty poor choices for bombers, though their SEAD and ATGM planes are pretty good. The only really good helicopter they have is an anti-air helicopter (which is admittedly one of the best), with practically no gunships and poor ATGM hauling helos. Their artillery selection is also (as you know) pretty piss poor.  I don't like spec decks, so I don't know if any of them are particularly useful.  I don't play coalitions much anymore, so I can't really speak on how effective RD is beyond the obvious -- you're trading avail for a better selection of tanks and some better bomber selections."

One thing people tend to miss: Chinese marines are great with 15 hp, great infantry fighting capability and AT that can take out super heavy tanks. They probably the best marines in the game. Compliment them with LiJian.  Otherwise China's weakness is the lack of ""Super"" units. I always prioritize m1a2's by using overwhelming numbers.

For the recon cougar being 20pts it fits perfectly in the mid-low range recon unit, consistent with other factions & equivalent recon options whereas the fire support version is priced perfectly for a med-low range fire support vehicle."
wargame,3e13dj,Itcausesproblems,3,Tue Jul 21 04:18:24 2015 UTC,"Actually, both versions are overpriced considering their stats. 25% accuracy means that it can not engage targets at long ranges (even splash damage won't do shit with accuracy that bad) and it's relegated to forest fighting ranges. So you're paying 20 points that can't stun infantry in a forest like an Afghanski or a vulcan can nor can engage faster aiming and higher rate of fire autocannon vehicles that will just disintegrate this thing within seconds.  Hell, even the 10 point recoiless rifle jeeps have more accuracy than this piece of shit and in some cases better rate of fire like the Rensou or Ontos. IMO, if the cougar and the rest of the HEAT gun vehicles were given 40% accuracy like the South Korean M36 or M41 it wouldn't be so bad."

wargame,3e27t2,DasHeadCrapHGN,3,Tue Jul 21 23:06:24 2015 UTC,I usually play Red Dragon when I get home really late (I street race on the weekends so I get home around 3 to 4 A.M.). Anyways as a result I frequent the Russian servers and when all the Russians go on all you see is Redfor stacking and the bluefor gets slaughtered a lot of the times. If you play when Americans are on you'll see Bluefor but if you play late at night when Russians get on you see Redfor fill up first.

The Saint Paul group is some 400 people large though so as a result we have scrict rules and only race in certain areas (usually empty industrial parks or unused old roads which Saint Paul mn is ripe with). So far the only death in the last 7 years was a biker I know who died a few weeks ago in a chase. His bike slid and took out a light post at 100mph. So yes we're criminals and all but at least we're the organised smart ones that know harming peds will only fuck us over. Oh and this isn't as related but if you were wondering I drive an old 1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse so while fast I mostly socialize since lots of cars can smoke me.

wargame,3e27t2,Cole7rain,3,Tue Jul 21 23:02:02 2015 UTC,"What are you basing this on, 10v10? The only reason Bluefor fills faster is because of people's sense of nationalism, it has nothing to do with balance.  The reality is the game is more balanced than it's ever been, and the only thing that really needs changing at this point is a buff to ATGMs on Soviet tanks (and maybe some tweaks to US infantry, not that they need it to be viable but USSR doesn't really NEED the tank buffs either to be viable)."
wargame,3e27t2,frankwouter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:45 2015 UTC,"Commonwealth, blue dragon  and NSWP and RD could so use some buffs though. They are all withouth any advantage vs the super coalitions.   How would you buff barrel atgms? They are already pretty damn good at elite and they only cost 5-10 pts (which os nothing on a 90 pts+ price)  extra vs the same non atgm tank. They are also the perfect  counter to glass cannons like leopard 1a5 and m8 ags.   My soviet decks runs t80 a and I really like them as second line tanks. The atgms really work (especially at elite in my soviet armor deck)."
wargame,3e27t2,PrinceDeTolly,5,Tue Jul 21 14:25:45 2015 UTC,GLATGMs aren't accurate enough to be reliable outside of armor decks and just end up being an extra 5-10pts wasted on something that will maybe hit once or twice in the lifetime of the tank at best. You say it's nothing on a 90pts+ tank price yet it has been so long since I've seen the T-72B or T-64BV used over it's gun only counterpart.
wargame,3e27t2,frankwouter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:36 2015 UTC,"If the option is there, they can keep it. I find the t72b to be a worthwhile upgrade since it allows a much faster second shot (by alternating main gun and atgm). The atgm is also cheap enough.  Making them better may require a price increase that make them underwhelming versus other tanks. And the other issue is that armored decks wil have the elite version of already good tank atgms."
wargame,3e27t2,kaeblo,2,Tue Jul 21 15:25:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like NSWP is pretty good. I can use their infantry better than ussr infantry.

wargame,3e27t2,frankwouter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:01 2015 UTC,They could use a solid medium tank and a better asf. The current asf doesn't have enough long range missiles. This is really apparent when fighting Scandinavia with 3 card of amraam planes.
wargame,3e27t2,Tanis_2589,2,Tue Jul 21 16:33:42 2015 UTC,"Eh, DLC 2 addressed a lot of shortcomings with the NWSP bloc. They have a good tank lineup, there is no issues there. Infantry is arguably the best on REDFOR, bar USSR. I have a strong preference to play NWSP over USSR.  ASF is weak, but they make that up in a strong AA lineup."
wargame,3e27t2,Cole7rain,2,Tue Jul 21 17:56:32 2015 UTC,"The problem is most maps outside of 10v10 don't cater to engagements at the ranges of ATGMs, so most of the time the extra money spent on ATGMs is a waste."
wargame,3e27t2,frankwouter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:52:34 2015 UTC,Use them for a quick 50 % dpm boost by firing the atgm during the main gun reload. Especially effective versus tanks with less then 10 armor. Makes a first shot miss less of an issue.

Redfor plays much different (also less new people friendly) and most (new) people play a large majority of their games as bluefor.   The other are small things like lack of IR aa in redfor (more micro/people not knowing about radar switching) and much more rocket arty in redfor (which is very tempting for new players).   Both red and blue can be really strong if played well and to their strengths (you can't play Russia like you play EC).

wargame,3dzt5r,DasHeadCrapHGN,2,Tue Jul 21 13:18:59 2015 UTC,"No, they don't. Chonma-ho has a firerate of only 6 rounds per minute while T-72M is only slightly better with its 7rpm. However, the T-72M also has a 2100M range cannon, which means that the T-80 will eat it for breakfast. Also these tanks have only 40% accuracy, which is quite bad, especially when compared to blufor and China."
wargame,3dzt5r,SovietPootis,2,Tue Jul 21 17:23:10 2015 UTC,"North Korea has damn good shock infantry (North Korean marines) and pretty damn good line tanks for those who don't like T-72/T-64/T-80s. They also bring a super heavy to the Red Dragon collation which allows co-use of the B-5, Li-Jan 90's, Chinese stealth tank, and T-90S. They have good artillery choices and also can use the little bird armed with grenade launchers which is a great 30pt choice since a pair of them can ""dust"" over an infantry battle. Their Mi-8 gunship brings Redfor an affordable rocket spammer that can also scare off the average player with its ATGMs (good players will know the ATGMs do nothing). Their a good choice for their unique tanks (yes their T-62s with a new turret but they're still different and they stand up to standard Abrams and Leo-1 A4s), shock infantry, and their super heavy is pretty good and of course the B-5 is amazing. What they lack is is heavy tank, good manpads, and good ASFs. Also on a final note their tanks are fantastic armor busters in close quarters since all but the Soviet models get KSVT 14.5mm machine guns with 1AP power.  Also due to the Sino-Soviet split most of China doesn't use Soviet equipment. The most they got are Chinese designed and produced T-55 clones (but they still have many notable differences although they are only something a tank fanatic would notice), their cheapest T-55 being Soviet bought ones from the early 50's, a few fighters, and that's really it. Their mid range MBTs (the tanks you'll use for most of the things you wouldn't waste a heavy or super heavy on) are all unique designs and their heaviest tank is competitive and 100% Chinese. They also field in game Stealth tanks, amazing amphibious tanks, great infantry, and in my opinion one of the best fast helicopters in the game (I mean duel auto-cannons and fast speed and Li-Jan 90's at only 55pts!). Red Dragons kick some amazing ass in most departments but they seem to lose popularity to their European neighbors due to their lack of ordinary heavy tanks (90 to 140 point tanks that can still be spammed) which are pretty good in the current meta."

wargame,3e0x5u,Milleuros,2,Tue Jul 21 22:00:24 2015 UTC,"EE singleplayer had major flaws in my opinion. The most important of them is probably that your amount of units was limited, from a mission to another. Say you lost a Leopard tank : then in the next mission you have one less Leo available. On the opposite, the enemy may have an unlimited number of units. It punishes even the smallest micromanagement error. I had once two Cobras go from my left side front forces to my right side one, but I had forgotten about a small town with basic infantry in the middle of the trajectory : lost both my cobras, so in the next mission I had only one cobra that I could deploy.  I also didn't like that you had to earn stars through secondary objectives, to unlock new units for your next missions. Number of stars was limited so you had to choose carefully your new unit. Achieving all secondary objectives the first time you do a mission is also hard, but doing the mission again leaves you vulnerable to losing a few more units, which you cannot afford to due to how limited they are."
wargame,3e0x5u,TheMarraMan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:18:43 2015 UTC,"The star earning is alright, adds some incentive. Bu I can see the flaws. And I'm not fond of of being able to refit your units. What I really like about it is the straight forward missions. No BS strategic map where I'll fight on the same map 4 times because the enemy keeps attacking that. I just prefer the ability to play with a clear set of objectives against an enemy that's not kamikaze like. It just makes it seem more realistic. Certainly not perfect, yet far better than ALB and RD. There is just something different about the AI in EE in my opinion..for now at least haha."
wargame,3e0x5u,Milleuros,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:44:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the mission style in EE. Much better than Red Dragon. Refitting your units, on the other hand, would allow the player to focus on single missions and allow the possibility of playing again the missions already completed, without fear of further weakening your forces for the incoming ones. I see why Eugene decided it that way : force the player to have as few losses as possible. But I don't like it.  Another flaw with this system is the impossibility of resetting the campaign, even if you come to the point where your forces cannot even hope to win the next mission."

wargame,3e0x5u,amzro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:15:09 2015 UTC,"My first post here :) I am kind of new to online, I only started to play seriously last Autumn with RD and mostly casual since my free time is limited (never played online previous versions). It's still a good game online but expect some hard time as a newbie and sometime frustrating results. Don't bother the navies, just don't play those kind of maps where opponents can bring ships.   As for balance, I think it's nicely done and every coalition/nation have its strengths/weaknesses, it is fun to discover them by playing.   Added to that, new maps are coming and maybe even more stuff."

wargame,3e0x5u,Nurizeko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:45:40 2015 UTC,"Navy isn't useless, on maps with water it can provide a back-breaking amphibious assault behind the enemy lines and cost them the game.  Also it's an element of the game that can be fun in it's own right.  Get Red Dragon if you want to play online, really that simple. It's the one being played by everyone else.   Airland Battle might get waxed on nostalgically by some but honestly there's nothing innately superior about it (other than non-Asian maps, which I believe won't be RD's problem for long)."
wargame,3e0x5u,Fascist_Pink,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:58:31 2015 UTC,"Red Dragon is reasonably balanced if you appreciate that Eugen, inexplicably, decided to port over every. single. damn. unit from the previous games. Most factions have everything required for a functional arsenal.  The problem comes generally with price comparisons within a certain pricerange. For instance, with the Scandinavia DLC the Leopard 1 range was a bit overbuffed; now BLUFOR's medium tanks outshine literally everything REDFOR has. But if you can appreciate this, you'll play where REDFOR is on par; late-year T-64, T-72 and T-80 variants."
wargame,3e0x5u,nated0ge,-3,Tue Jul 21 04:13:04 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend Red Dragon to anyone (or any Wargame franchaise) at the moment. The online community shrinks by the day and the number of pub stomping/stacking is becoming very hard to justify a purchase at full cost.

Maybe hudo-ren could become a 15man squad and remain 25 points because their weapons are pretty meh now but it would be a nice DPS increase for them however their overall power is still lower than maybe wachreg. Highlanders could go down to 10 and 15, maybe they could get a grizz or m113. Lekha gun could go upto 500+ ROF and the RR could use ROF of 10. Gongbobyong are fucked but a 10 ROF RR would be nice.

I agree that the light inf with bad atgms should get a price buff, but 10 hp shock atgms with 26 ap would not improve gameplay and would promote camping.   Highlanders should be priced like regular inf, maybe 20 pts for the 90 version with cqc mg. They stay regular inf.  Light riflemen 90 are already fine as light inf. They have enough firepower to kill ifvs and a good mg to kill inf in the open. The 10 hp a big upside versus 2 men atgm teams.   Leichte etc need 16 ap to 1 shot 2 armor transports. This and shock training would be a nice unit."

wargame,3dye9u,samoandragon,4,Mon Jul 20 16:31:25 2015 UTC,That is not the idea behind light riflemen 90. They are not a tank buster unit. They are for keeping away transports and vehicles and also being able to fight inf that wants to enter the town. Which is a role they excell in right now.  Get Bradley ifvs if you want anti tank atgms (or any other of the USA 6 tow 2 carriers).  50 %acc with the ability to 1 shot most transports is a pretty damn good considering it is very survivable with its 10 hp (takes 5-10 tank shells if in building cover or 4 tank shells in the open).
wargame,3dye9u,flightwusel,3,Mon Jul 20 16:38:48 2015 UTC,"100% agree, they have their niche, which is that opening land grab. US gets the all powerful dap, you take your daps and your light riflemen '90 in blackhawks, take a forward city, let the rifleman '90 take out the 150km enemy transports hurtling towards the city and stall long enough for your armor and anti tank units to arrive and reinforce your position.  Later on you can still put them to use by placing them in flanking positions to punish push outs from the enemy. US gets so many fun toys as it is, if your trying to win by charging head first with infantry as the US you're doing it wrong."

wargame,3dye9u,Thoralf87,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:14:50 2015 UTC,"So.... before I get into this, what is the original thinking behind ""Light Infantry""?  It seems they're in game as a catch-all unit to hold a position versus a wide range of targets... a jack of all trades, yet a master of none.  In Wargame, this essentially = useless.  So first, a primer on Light Infantry:  These guys were skirmishers and acted as screening forces versus an enemy.  They traded firepower for mobility.  The problem though: the most mobile infantry units in game have to rely on helicopters, which are a liability when near enemy units.      Many choppers take fucking forever to unload/load troops  Choppers can't fly ""nap of the earth"" which means the second you try and use them to move infantry around, they get killed.   The fix to Light Infantry needs to go beyond simple weapons fixes, they need to fix how helicopters operate in game IMO, which means improvements in their altitude an LOS to enemy units.  That being said: I'd pretty much remove most Light Infantry from the game or repurpose them.    If we can't do that, I'd make these changes:   Treat all Light Infantry ATGMs as the ERYX and let them be used versus infantry targets.  A Dragon II can hit a building or position just as well as a tank (which means probably not great at all). Give them CQC weaponry.  This emphasizes their tactical mobility. Make them 15-man teams if not already (I don't have the game in front of me, so I'm unsure of this)"
wargame,3dye9u,frankwouter,3,Mon Jul 20 15:51:08 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea. I would be game for a general helo fix as it were. Flying under cover of a tree lime would be a nice buff. Making Light Infantry Shock teams and/Or 15 man will further increase the power of nations/coalitions that don't have great Marine or Airborne units while simultaneously allowing you to wliminate them from other specialtues.   While i love my Canadian Airborne in Norad Motorized, it makes little sense."
wargame,3dye9u,AdwokatDiabel,3,Mon Jul 20 16:28:58 2015 UTC,I much prefer these suggestions. The main problem of light infantry is that their tactical role is based on being air mobile. Air mobility however is artificially gimped by the game's mechanics.
wargame,3dye9u,frankwouter,2,Mon Jul 20 16:32:41 2015 UTC,15 men atgm squads with metis  m would absolutely ruing the game if backed up by some ags 17/spetz.  Much like how eryx fire support is right now but with more range.

According to your comment history you're one of those guys commonly found playing 10v10 on the reddit servers anyway. 10v10 is devoid of the strategical stability required for a legitimate metagame to develop in the first place, which is the foundation of any balance discussion.  USSR is only slightly stronger than USA, definitely not as unbalanced as you suggest. USSR air is only slightly better, and USSR infantry are significantly better but that's where the advantages stop. If we were to extend the discussion to NORAD vs. SOVIET-KOREAN Alliance, then it's no contest as NORAD is definitely stronger ('75 C2A1 Airborne/MEXAS/Rifles '85 + TH-495/Voodoo/Centurion Marksman/CRV7 Gunships)   USSR has better tanks   Don't make me laugh, this is so incredibly wrong it hurts.  The M1A2 is the best god damn tank in the game by far. I'll take more AP, better accuracy, and god-like stabilizers over yet another ATGM any day of the week. USSR has ATGMs coming out the ass, thus they are mostly redundant & inflationary to the point costs of Soviet tanks.   better helicopters   Transport helicopters, sure... but that's it. Not that helicopter openers actually work against a US player who knows the power of the DAP. The changes to the DAP alone gave the US the best helicopter opener in the game, and the Longbow has no equal. The KA-52 is highly situational, and is only really useful when combined with an Mi-28/KA-50 against an enemy who doesn't have any Crotale/Chap/Short-Arrow/etc.    Better AA   Now you're just making shit up, I'll easily take Stinger Cs and the Patriot over the Tunguska. The Tunguska is good, but it's also much more likely to die due to the proximity to the front line SPAAGs need to placed at.   Better/comparable artillery   So which is it, better or comparable? I'd say comparable. The ATACMS is definitely better than the SMERCH in the hands of a player who abuses recon (AKA good players). In fact the SMERCH gets much worse as the enemy player gets better, simply because better players will spread their units out and react quicker to incoming SMERCH attacks. MSTA is slightly better than the Paladin, but that's not saying much as they both suck when compared to the Caesar & AS-90. USSR definitely has some of the best mortars in the game after the French VPM 120."

My reasoning behind this is that even if they don't have perfect accuracy, I can take more of them and make up for it. Plus you're going to almost always need two hits to kill a chopper anyway. I like to group them in pairs and hide them close to my frontline infantry. At~30 pts a piece in 5 point transports they can still earn their keep as long as that pair shoots down even a single attack heli. I'd probably take them over cheap fighters as well, more numbers and overall effectiveness for less or equal points."

For MANPADS, which can't be attacked by such long-range ATGMs, it doesn't matter that much, since you'll still be out of their range. What DOES matter is the amount of HE damage you dish out. It takes a lot more 4HE missiles to kill an armored attack helicopter, giving said aircraft a chance to get in rocket range and stun/kill your squad."

wargame,3dztcr,frankwouter,2,Tue Jul 21 22:05:35 2015 UTC,"They should only be used when their is no alternative.   Javalin is pretty bad, but has 5 he damage so it can work in numbers. It also has 2450m range which makes it less vunrable vs helicopters with rocket pods. But since sas or stinger c usually goes into the same decks, it is not really worth taking (and wolverine is a much better Javalin platform with mobility and 3 round bursts).   Rbs 70 is just a POS. The accuracy is bad, it is guided, range is okay and the 4he is absolute garbage vs planes and hinds. It is also rather expensive for what it does.   Rbs 70 mk2 is pretty okay in a Norwegian deck. The 2.8 km range often suprised people and gives your units more time to kill the target before getting killed. Still a rbs 70 though.   Rbs 90 is sometimes pretty good. Still has 4he syndrome, but 55% accuracy and 2.8 km range makes it a nice akula and mi 8 killer. It also has increased anti plane range (which also catches people of guard). Still very unreliable at times and only good in 2 or more stacks. Also pretty expensive, but it does deal with helicopters at max atgm range. Rbs 90 rovers are absolutely lovely and the dual launcher really helps getting the burst damage in (use in pairs for semi reliable first burst kill).   Upvetting guided manpads is very important to keep their morale under control and increase accuracy."
wargame,3dztcr,ArchOwl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:50:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think I'd take them ever. The missile is soooooo slow. Usually with F&F you get 2 missiles off before a chopper can retaliate which is huge, as it doesn't matter if the MANPADS get killed even as long as that missile is off it is the accuracy of release. With GUIDE missiles they are uber slow and you get shot at before your 2nd missile hits which causes it to miss 99% of the time. To me it's not worth it."

wargame,3dy3t7,frankwouter,4,Mon Jul 20 14:16:20 2015 UTC,Multiple m35 do have increased reload/repair speed compared to 1 hemmt.  But hemmt is too fast and cost efficient and armored to choose a m35.

wargame,3dy3t7,Kappa043,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:01:00 2015 UTC,That offroad speed and armor and 10 hp really make it the best though.   I also kinda like the amfibil supply truck. It is the only way to rescue vehicles stuck in a river or past a river withouth risking a super visible helicopter.

In any case REDFOR's biggest balance issue right now, as far as I can tell, is that there's almost no reason to play a faction that doesn't include USSR.

Anyway, this deck should have your regular cards that you know and love, but with some cannon fodder in there. Lots of cheap units to spread across the map like sticky penis butter. Think auto cannons, reservists, t34's, jeeps, (I <3 m48's), etc.. So this hot mess of cheap units needs to cover your flanks, so that other cocksucker won't sneak some bullshit reacharound and touch your soft CV. Speaking of CV's, I've you could instead just spend that lube money on tank CV's and blow those pesky attack recon units outta the forest, but personally, I enjoy knowing there's nothing behind my lines.  Other miscellaneous shit you should consider while playing 1v1 roshambow, is that your big heavy hitters may often not have a chance to be played. Consider dropping your 180pt Rafiale super phalus superiority fighter for a couple cheaper scrappy dogfighting mirages, because who has a chance to save $180 when both the Poot'n and Kim Jong Ding Dong are busy shooting your door down? (NK T-34's have 3x the MG ammo that USSR's do and don't you ever fucking forget, because 300 rounds will last you less than a single camel crush.)  I saw some other redditor mention mortars..If you don't have a card, you're not doing it right. SMOKE aiming times are shorter than HE. Full barreled artillery is less equipped for combating the small amount of quick skirmishes that is 1v1WGmlgxxx.   There's always room for improvement and new strats in WG 1v1's.  I mean, I don't know if anyone here watches Super Smash Bro's Melee competitions, but that game and it's competitive play is way more than a decade old, and the guys nowadays have developed so much tech and in depth game knowledge, that the people who compete nowadays would tear those original competitors a brand new hole. Coming back off the tangent though, wargame is way more in depth than SSBM! heck, it's got double the physical dimensions and like 200 times the units. If you don't observe new crazy shit every week playing 1v1's, you need more recon or you need to sit down in that replay center and do some long and hard thinking young man, and figure out how that twat enseminated you.

wargame,3ds1wg,flightwusel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:44:20 2015 UTC,"That's not true either. Destruction only bunkers down when both teams are equally strong at every point of the map or if it has horrible chokepoints (looking at you, Straight to the point). But you often have 3v1 situations where one team pushes, while on the other flank it's the exact opposite. So you find the entire map pivoting, resulting in interesting fights. Asgard is the best example for that.  I have the most fun when both teams are equal and actively push. I like to jump in the gap if I have an easy game on my sector, to support the other guys, and we can push on a broader front."
wargame,3ds1wg,JustARandomGerman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:01:11 2015 UTC,If you bunker down in 1v1 you are likely to be flanked. 1v1 is the art of covering a lot with few units while reading your enemy and finding weak spots.

wargame,3ds1wg,wolfphilosopher,3,Sun Jul 19 17:34:07 2015 UTC,"Lots of good tips here.  Some of this depends on game type (destruction vs conquest) I prefer to play time limited total destruction matches, makes for a good mix.  Here is how I approach it.    You rarely have the points to pull out high end units like superheavy tanks, 180pt fighters, and even the Patriot unless you up the income to high.  (Which I don't recommend because it becomes very spammy.)    My ideal 1v1 deck is Blue Dragons.  You have strong shock infantry with solid RPGs for destroying tanks and vehicles in forests and near cities.  Chu-Mat infantry are very cost effective, and the base infantry in grenade launcher transports are cheap as shit and very effective.  The combination of some great units with lots of spammable troops allows you to push in the right areas, while still covering the rest of the map.  The IR AA net is awesome!  Non-seadable is key as it removes an element of micro, and is much cheaper so you get better coverage.  You also need some super cheap SPAAGS to cover your flanks/rear against the inevitable helo spam cheez.    Great combination of cost effective tanks.  Particularly the K1 and the Shiki G.  Plus you have decent availability on the Kyu Maru Shiki if you end up needing a heavy.  You need lots of recon because you need to scout for your attacks, recon the flanks to identify helo spam, have recon in your base to prevent his recon sneaking in and CV sniping, and you also likely want to send your own recon teams to scout his base.  So you need lots of cheap recon, spread between effective infantry and infantry killing vehicles.  You also want to have helos that can kill tank/mechanized spam for when you run across one of those cheezers.  The AH-1 makes a great option here with 8 ATGMs, and is also cost effective at providing general fire support.  I actually like the effectiveness of the F-1 as a general bomber, its cheap, but deadly and you can afford to lose a few to kill key targets if need be.  The ATGM F-4 is also effective and really cheap.  Finally I run 2x cards of the SEAD/ASF dual role F-16.  As you can see from my load out, you need a combination of cheap but effective spammable units, but also high end units in key areas to ensure you don't get steamrolled.  And micro the shit out of them."
wargame,3ds1wg,lowflier,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:45:03 2015 UTC,what are the must units for 1v1? cheap but effective units?
wargame,3ds1wg,__Javert__,3,Sun Jul 19 00:07:28 2015 UTC,the german jagers are incredibly cheap spam units. Mortars are also very good for 1v1 on small maps and they can easily stun opposing rushes or smoke to cover attacks
wargame,3ds1wg,hue_yes,3,Sun Jul 19 01:19:53 2015 UTC,"k1/m1ips are very cost effective tanks  the 3 front/side armor norwegian transport is very good for its price  the east german mot. schutzen are effective and cheap shock inf  bmpts are quite strong against infantry if used properly  the bmp-1d is a great transport because of its grenade launcher (same can be said for many blue dragon units)  the 90 point su-24 sead aircraft can be effective for killing high-end radar aa units your opponent might use. I like to use them as a cheeky way to kill 120 pt patriots for a guaranteed net point gain.  Advanced recon helicopters can be almost OP and I definitely consider them must haves, but your level of play may not be responsible enough for a 100+ point helicopter yet.   Finally, try to make sure your units are working together. Units that try to work by themselves without combined support will simply get destroyed in detail. Example: enemy has infantry running havoc in a wooded area? send a unit of infantry to flush them out, which is supported by tanks/apcs right behind it. The enemy decides to bomb your small force? Make sure you have an air superiority fighter loitering while your small force pushes in the woods to punish any bombers. And so on, and so forth.   Try to use recon as much as you can and then artillery any units you spot. At the same time, make sure all your units are hidden so that a random peace rhine doesn't side snipe your precious t-72 on the side."

I is not uncommon the counter expensive heli rushes with just one of them (55pt). Even if the enemy helis AT missile outrange the mistral they will die because in the time they stop an lock on the VBL it will get in range and shoot with an OP rate of fire.

Your still doing .1 damage per 1 HE damage against 7 top armor (not even sure if any tanks have that much top armor) so with sufficient HE bombing you can still take out tanks."

wargame,3dss4a,thegoldelite,3,Tue Jul 21 10:12:09 2015 UTC,Archowl is right. HE hits top armor and does do damage
wargame,3dss4a,Saltysalad,2,Sun Jul 19 04:52:04 2015 UTC,"He also does damage to armor, but it is much reduced as armor increases:  armor   HE  Small Arms Infantry    1   1 Armor 0 1   1 Armor 1 1   0.1 Armor 2 0.4 0 Armor 3 0.3 0 Armor 4 0.2 0 Armor 5 0.15    0 Armor 6 0.1 0 Armor 7 0.1 0 Armor 8 0.05    0 Armor 9 0.05    0 Armor 10    0.05    0 Armor 11    0.05    0 Armor 12    0.05    0 Armor 13    0.05    0 Armor 14    0.01    0 Armor 15    0.01    0 Armor 16    0.01    0 Armor 17    0.01    0 Armor 18    0.01    0 Armor 19    0.01    0 Armor 20    0.01    0 Armor 21    0.01    0 Armor 22    0.01    0 Armor 23    0.01    0 Armor 24    0.01    0     The number in the he column is the multiplayer that you apply to the amount of he damage your doing to a target with x armor. This gives the amount of damage the armored target receives.   So a 10 he bomb hits a 4 armor target> 0.2*10= 2 damage.   Also keep in mind that laser guided bombs (sk60b, harrier gr 7, nighthawk) hit top armor if the weapon is fired by targeting the vehicle. So you have to use the top armor of the target to calculate the damage done.   Source: hidden knowledge spreadsheet in the sidebar."

wargame,3dr5op,frankwouter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:39:10 2015 UTC,"I agree that the stats are poorly displayed as well, but I think there is such a large arbitrary difference between pretty similar machine guns (like how an MG3 does almost twice the DPS as an M60) that the gap between them should be lessened, or they should do something similar with machine guns like they did with the primary weapons of a unit, and standardize them in some easily understandable fashion."

wargame,3dr5op,wolfphilosopher,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:54:46 2015 UTC,"It strikes me as such a decisive difference for equipment that was mostly interchangeable. I'd rather the game be balanced than historically accurate, however. Whatever that takes.  Edit: spelling"
wargame,3dr5op,Cole7rain,13,Mon Jul 20 14:38:13 2015 UTC,"Eh... a lot of people forget that infantry are balanced asymmetrically through the AT weapons and transport they come with. For example while US Riflemen '90 have close to the lowest DPS in the game, they also have the best 5 point transport in the game and one of the strongest line infantry AT weapons.  I like this kind of asymmetry to the game, but with that said those attributes are not always as useful as the raw DPS of Jager or Fusileers '90."
wargame,3dr5op,Cole7rain,2,Sat Jul 18 19:44:26 2015 UTC,"I'd say the asymmetry, if there, should be much more minor and less seemingly arbitrary than it currently is. If flavor is what we are going for, you could change the accuracy stat for the unit using it, but make the system more transparent.  Again there is still plenty of asymmetry with other weapons, this would just make one aspect of the game more balanced (hence, why the folks at Uralgraznomod did it)."
wargame,3dr5op,842wolves,2,Sun Jul 19 02:05:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah it does kinda make Riflemen '90/Motostrelki '90 feel like walking AT weapons.   I find myself playing NORAD more than US these days, for an extra 5 points Canadian Rifles '85 in TH-495s are infinitely better than Riflemen '90 in M113s."
wargame,3dr5op,Cole7rain,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:48:23 2015 UTC,"If this is true, then eugen needs to look at panzergrenadiers. They have one of the best AT, the have the best mg, and they have the best transport option which is the marder 2. I mean, that ifv has more armor than a lot of tanks that cost the same and sometimes cost more. It also has a high firing rate with 70% accuracy, so it almost always gets hits on its targets which cannot be said for many tanks that cost the same or even cost more."
wargame,3dr5op,nani_sore,3,Sun Jul 19 04:34:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah Eurocorp has always been one of the strongest coalitions for this reason, the l.mg3 was nerfed awhile ago so they used to be even stronger. Eurocorp doesn't really have any top of the line bombers, long range Radar AA, or 2800m+ AT gunships though...so they aren't without their weaknesses.  Also the l.mg3 has fairly low suppression compared to other machine guns. The 1975 Canadian Airborne are actually quite a bit deadlier than Panzergrenadiers because of the suppression on the C2A1. At 350m (forest fighting) The l.mg3 puts out 1.23 suppression damage/m2 per second, while the C2A1 puts out a whopping 4.46."

Just yesterday, i was Blufor in a 10v10. At the start, i was able spot the silhouettes of many of my opponent's units. Two Strela, one T72, four BTR 80. Thought for sure i was facing a USSR general deck. Once i get a better view, it was a North Korean deck. The person brought out Pongae, T90S, and BTR 80A.  Unfortunately, part of the issue is that Refor just didn't have the same variety. Only China has significantly different units because of the Sino Soviet split.  Edit: As the poster below me said, Czechs are also pretty unique."

Now that they have them. Though there are people who begrudge them even that. Looking at you /u/RangerPL .  So I guess RDs can be strong to somebody who knows how to use their best units.

I have nothing against Commonwealth receiving buffs to their tanks and AA capabilities. I play Brits national quite often too, and abuse the LAW-80/AS-90 like a motherfucker. A faction shouldn't be defined by two standout units that are head and shoulders above everyone else's for some contrived reason.  National flavor should be far more subtle.  And yes, I know how to play. I, too, can beat a bad player with Red Dragons. That doesn't make them not weak. There's a reason literally every ranked game consists of Scandinavia spam."
wargame,3dqgzv,Chimpville,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:05:49 2015 UTC,"Hm. As far as I can tell so far, the UGM you plug nerfed CW while giving huge buffs to the US and Russia. I actually find things more balanced in the regular version. The only thing I really like is the reduction in price for command vehicles, it seems to make the gameplay a bit more aggressive. Though this could just be the average UGM user is a bit more savvy and committed than those of the regular game."
wargame,3dqgzv,RangerPL,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:19:43 2015 UTC,"CW got buffs to their machine guns and tanks. I actually played them quite a bit and liked the results I got. Thanks to the Chieftain series, Commonwealth got high-AP tanks at a lower price point than anyone else. They also got ROF buffs.  The only CW thing I can admit hasn't been touched is British AA, as that's still in the bouncing-ideas-off-the-wall stage. Ural mod is still a work in progress, remember, and things like air power haven't been touched at all.   while giving huge buffs to the US and Russia   If by buffs you mean removing artificial weaknesses, then guilty as charged. Neither faction gained any unique new capability."
wargame,3dqgzv,Chimpville,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:31:07 2015 UTC,"The armour buff is pretty sparse when their infantry took the hit they did, and with little done to improve the AA situation.   If by buffs you mean removing artificial weaknesses, then sure. Neither faction gained any unique new capability.   Big buffs to the Rifle and Moto 90s and price reduction to 10pts is hugely significant. As significant, if not more so than the LAW80 buff (nobody seemed to care before it received another 175m range). Nerfing all manpads to 4HE is a big win to the two decks with the best Air and Helo tabs. Also the buffed ADATS in the US deck. Sure it's within scope and in time-frame but you can say that about a hell of a lot of other things that would benefit other factions.  Edit: Oh yeah, the man-portable TOW-2 was another big buff."

Scandi IFVs are a lot better as well.  Support- Scandis have better low end AA, LVKV 90s are god tier, NASAMs blow TORs out of the water, and EOTS Hawks don't even need radar micro. And of course the Otomatic, but that's less of anti air and more anti everything. For arty support AMOS>any other mortar and BKAN>slow firing MSTA and Ondava  Tanks: Scandis win the cost effectiveness contest at every tier and match EB for superheavies, granted they have no intermediate heavy to compete with wilk M2s but that tier have been out of style for a while considering how hard superheavies smash them. I haven't seen Dynas for a while since they work out to be an even shittier T-62MV1 and once you get into gun range (or 90% of engagements), they melt like a 40pt tank.  Recon is equal since they have almost the same roster of roles, except for panserbils. It's funny that you would say to use autocannons to counter panserbils since EB autocannons are very bad.   Vehicles is an easy scandi win, assault guns are cool but EB doesn't have a TOW2 jeep equivalent  or a good light tank like the IKV 105.  EB has awful tankbusting helos and decent AA helos, and the 240mm doom rockets cost 75pts now after 10 rounds of nerfs. It's nice to have the options but it won't affect the battle majorly.  If you like anti tank planes then I guess EB may be your thing, but otherwise Scandis can bring twice as many equal or better quality ASFs, better bombers, bargain basement LGBs and Zuni planes, and the only slightly OP Puffs.  The trick to fighting NSWP is to fight them literally anywhere else on the map but in a forest since there you are superior in every way that matters."
wargame,3dqgzv,frankwouter,2,Sat Jul 18 16:11:52 2015 UTC,Interesting aa point. I really enjoy NSWP aa and kinda hate Scandi aa (except eots hawk ). Strop 2 has so much dps and range and is non radar. The grom is also much better then rbs 90 and you have a lot of manpads everywhere with lstr 40. I would also say sopel>rover rbs 90/lvkv (I almost never use them).  Nasams>tors is also interesting. Nasams doesn't have that nice helicopter range and 12 ammo. And it also only has 5 hp 0 armor. Both are really good and underused (for no obvious reason). Ottomagic is mostly bad or win more. Also suffers from major prime target syndrome. Stil really really nice.   How do you fight in a forest with NSWP?  I prefer shock flamers/mot shultzen 90 main body supported by lstr 40 for aa and anti tank. Also a bunch of ags 17 for super stunning and recon special forces. The assault rifles and  carbines really make a difference vs a force that uses battle and assault.

You sacrifice roundedness for 8 supers with Sweden, but it's a fine balance when USSR/SOVKOR armored also loses so much for going spec.

wargame,3dmjs7,TehRoot,3,Fri Jul 17 17:03:29 2015 UTC,They are not really choke point .als due to side spawns on the map. This creates big battles at the sides and room in the middle.

wargame,3dnr89,Tied12,3,Fri Jul 17 19:57:03 2015 UTC,"The ondava is also a great choice because it carries fifty shells and has great autonomy. It can move away from fobs for long periods; by avoiding the usual arty rally points and using its speed, ondava can avoid counter battery and fire from secluded locations.   Alternatively, why not both? In a general Eastern Bloc deck you can pair 203s and 10 second tubes."
wargame,3dnr89,ZappBrannigan42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:38:53 2015 UTC,It's speed allows it to stay with your attacking force to turn them into super mortars with really short delay between aiming and hitting the target. The 7 he round are so effective vs anything not a tank.
wargame,3dnr89,frankwouter,3,Sat Jul 18 14:48:00 2015 UTC,The 10 sec aim time is a huge advantage. It increases volume of fire for short volleys and allows you to hit targets way more often. You can even hit infantry on the move.   30 sec is just to much to hit any well controlled target during a push or while being pushed.
wargame,3dnr89,frankwouter,5,Fri Jul 17 22:11:27 2015 UTC,"Ondava. The only 203mm arti I would use is the North Korean one since you get 3 of them per card.

Though a Dana spam can be pretty damn efficient, the availability is great."

wargame,3dnr89,Twisp56,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:10:57 2015 UTC,"Ondava. Even though it has one of the longest salvo times out of any 10 second artillery piece (making it extremely vulnerable to an ATACMS piece that is reloaded and ready to fire) it is still a 10 second artillery piece.  Now why is that important? Because 90% of the time with 30 second artillery, the target you want to hit (whether it be infantry, AA, or other artillery) has already moved and is long gone. With the more accurate 30 second artillery pieces like the M110 or Malka, you're essentially banking on whatever you're hitting to still be there after 30 seconds. 90% of the time I find that that is not the case. If you're playing against competent players who are smart enough to reposition their AA and artillery after everytime they fire, all non-10 second artillery pieces essentially become fucking worthless.  I think the problem with a lot of people who use 10 second artillery think they only need 1 or 2 pieces to kill the things they're hitting. Against infantry, 1 or 2 pieces is sufficient, but for everything else 1 or 2 with not deliver enough HE in time to kill what they're hitting. Even with 3600m dispersion (which is nowhere near ATACMS level of accuracy) the majority of the rounds you'll be firing will not hit their target, but will land near it. At best, you'll deliver some splash damage and stuns, but with the 4-8 rounds in 1 to 2 10 second artillery pieces that is not good enough. That's why I always recommend using 3 or 4. Yeah, it's expensive, but if you micro them right (repositioning them everytime you fire [sometimes before it finishes it salvo for the Ondava]) and give them plenty of easy targets to kill, you'll be quickly making back all the points you spent and then some.  Thankfully in an Eastern Block deck you can get 2 Ondavas and 2 MSTAs in the support tab and 2 more Ondavas in the Naval tab. For a Czech only deck you can get 3 Ondavas in the support tab and 2 more in the Naval tab. Also in the Eastern Block deck you can get 2 East German BM-27s which have 10 second aim time although it is not as good as 4 Smerches are."

Not good vs spetz, but not bad vs Pekhota/btr90. Tracked grenade launchers follow, along with some reservists to soak RPO and garrison.  Alternate form includes air mobile manpads to follow a SF insert.  As for support, the F4D bomber is overpriced IMO with too small a drop pattern. Not a problem because 3x K9 Thunder along with your choice of super long range Grads or siege guns. Air tab should probably have 6x peace pheasant, but the napalmers are ok too. Especially on brown maps, the tow2 jeeps can help out with the anti-armor mission.   For not having an AA chopper, a surprising amount of work can get done with the cobras as well because you can easily suppress/kill IR AA with thunders.   I don't use the M48 WRSA because the accuracy is underwhelming, I take the M36 tank destroyer card instead.

So enough credibility.  2) Around 30+ nerfs and very few significant buffs. Every strong unit / problem gets nerfed and the asymmetry vanishes. Buffs only to unused units (and the wolverine)  3) You nerf the unpopular factions. Eurocorps and America are basically mini-nerfed because they are so popular. Soviet is nerfed quite a bit but are a strong faction. RD and Scandi are nerfed because they are viable but fuck them nobody plays them. BD are untouched because they are so exotic that nobody knows what they do. CW is buffed in recon inf but not any main part.  4) Laserguided bombs are way to strong (massive price increases by 10-20 pts (except for the nighthawk because there are too many US players).   5) Lots of units are unused (like light tanks and autocannon IFV) but nobody knows how to make them better and its hard to balance.  6) The Antiair helicopter difference is going to shrink (DAP nerfed 10pts and Mi24-V buffed 5 pts) and all helicopter should become more equal.  7) Lots of units are good because of mechanical issues. For example the Cassiopeia has a 360° fire arc and the Mi-27 has a good AT gun.

wargame,3dmje6,haydentheking,3,Fri Jul 17 14:06:37 2015 UTC,"As with any airborne deck, once you start losing units they are expensive to replace.  Airborne is best used to secure a distant sector long enough while a friendly mechanized / armored deck's reinforcements are advancing to solidify the hold. You'll find it hard to deal with any kind of armored or mechanized push with any kind of decent AA cover (anything that outranges your longbow)."
wargame,3dmje6,zman122333,3,Fri Jul 17 14:26:17 2015 UTC,"I've played both US and NORAD airborne. I honestly prefer US, because the slight bonus to availability. Yes, I miss out on the Canadian Airborne, but they only come in helicopters. US infantry can come in humvees, and you get a shitload.  For shock troops, I just use DELTA in V-150s...and a shitload of them. If I'm struggling at fighting better infantry in a city, DELTA will do a better job than the Canadian airborne and come in a wheeled transport.  The US also happens to have some of the best fire support vehicles in the game, and you get access to a handful as airborne. Littlebirds, DAP, Heavy Hogs, Cobras blah blah.  That said, if the loss of 5 points and availability doesn't bother you, NORAD gets you some fun stuff too. You can get another high end SEAD jet, the aforementioned Canadian airborne, the AP rocket equipped Huey, and the Canadian recce with that glorious .50.  As mentioned, you'll essentially be support. Call in airstrikes on fortified positions, napalm shit, kill B-5s. You're fully capable of fielding a lot of infantry, but that's really all you'll get. The M8 is great at helping, but leave the tank fighting to another player.  What I've wound up doing a lot, is supporting our Mech player. If he takes some serious hits from a B-5 or the like, I can send in a shitload of riflemen 90 in humvees, getting there quickly to slow down any advance. Obviously they won't stop it, but they're a good enough stopgap.  Take the Longbow, a card of apaches, fire support choppers, M8, ground attack jets, bombers, ASFs, SEAD and a shitload of infantry. Focus on wheeled infantry, but still take some in choppers for early land grab and quick reinforcements."
wargame,3dmje6,onewithoutasoul,2,Fri Jul 17 16:33:03 2015 UTC,"As deadweight mentioned, NORAD is a bit better because of Canadian Airborne and a few other key units.   Playing airborne is a lot like playing a support deck in the sense that they have one very specific role and little beyond that. Airborne should be used to take a forward town/command in the early game, and then provide some Air Superiority toward the middle/end while supporting a mechanized or motorized push into a second or third town.  Your biggest threat is Ironically also your greatest strength. Depending on how well supported an armored player is, you can either chew through them like nothing or have no ability to dislodge them whatsoever. In a 10v10, it would behoove you to work closely with a mechanized or motorized player."

You'll have to keep in mind what other posters have already mentioned though, as well as:  Airborne decks have a bonus to infantry. US Infantry is aids, but Canadian infantry is pretty good - thus making NORAD a pretty decent compromise for an airborne deck, since I doubt you'll fill those last 5 slots with anything truly meaningful anyways.  You really ought to coordinate with your team, and have some sort of plan if the enemy has AA / Armor. I usually tend to pick airborne on decks where our team has n+1 players, with n being the number of ""lanes"" any given map has. This ensures that your shitty deck shouldn't get caught in the front lines by someone else's vetted armor.   Hope this helps, airborne decks are tons of fun to play as, but take some coordination and imagination to make really successful. Good luck!"

wargame,3djwxa,Drahos,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:09:54 2015 UTC,"I wonder if fast ATGM's  like the Arkans have different roll mechanics due to missile speed. Im almost sure it plays a role because the crappy ATGM's on the SKOT-2AM which are very slow, seems to roll again somewhere near the end of the flight, and they are only 2450m range. Also, regarding the MI-28/AKULA, I play only with the MI-28 on my deck and since u don't engage AA anyway its working rather well to go a bit below 2800 (around 2750) and it seem's it doesn't roll again. Best way to do this is to move forward in half circles instead of stopping and shooting. On top of that, the fact that the Havoc has 15% more base accuracy then the AKULA, can get the same amount of them (2) with higher veterancy and prevent second hit roll without sacrificing too much range, makes it more accurate the the AKULA. For ground ATGMs its pointless to use any vehicle with higher then 2625m range, the second hit roll just makes it useless. In all my decks, the only ATGM vehicle i use and gives me good results is the US vee2tow."
wargame,3dit68,noobyfish_hk,12,Thu Jul 16 16:46:39 2015 UTC,The Recon Bradley is a very powerful tool indeed. It's optics combined with the TOW-2 make it very well suited as a standoff weapon that can deter armored pushes. That being said you should probably support it and the 25mm cannon probably won't cut it alone. If you want something with a decent autocannon to support your infantry and deal with light vehicles the COMVAT has a 45mm cannon and is a good choice at 30 pts in the vehicle tab. You could also go with one of the infantry transport Bradleys and just bring in some cheap riflemen with them.

wargame,3dipm1,BLITZCRANKD,5,Thu Jul 16 16:35:38 2015 UTC,"japan general deck fanboy here, can confirm.   BD works better than either nation, with Japan being playable but ROK not really IMO. ROK specifically relies on motorized manpads because it has not 150kph AA and this is deal-breaker. Conversely, Japan lacks the Tow2 heli, recon elites, SEAD, and ATGM plane that give the coalition deck the tools it needs.  You have to kill one or two T90 at the beginning of the round using ninja/F1 to pop the tungs and an F4E or cobraT to take the T90 count down. Otherwise, against equal skilled player, you will never dislodge sovkor.   Edit: japan deck discussion for OP's edification: https://www.reddit.com/r/wargame/comments/38ogae/deck_building_thread_of_the_week_65/  while i'm here ROK isn't the absolute worst, but pretty bad. You get blackhawk transports but nothing to escort them. The armor situation is bad, with K1A1 being a terrible unit that you nevertheless must use, but you can overcome this with six ATGM planes. The super dicey part is making your initial motorized land grab with no AA except expensive as hell Mistral teams. If you can accomplish that, ROK is solid for the rest of the round."

wargame,3di68y,wigglefish,5,Thu Jul 16 13:59:59 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the radar as much, rapier FSA is in an OK place now, it's the IR that gets me. you have ONE (1) 150kph AA, and that is the wolverine, which is not great. And you might have to burn activation points and slots on Javelin/saxon or Javelin/bison just to have enough AA with fast pushes. Otherwise CW is fine, I just feel like it's more vulnerable to bombs and quick gunship raids than other factions.   Even the slow AA: ADATS has laughable accuracy and Stormer mediocre. A well managed Akula combo can skirt the edges of a commonwealth force, sniping shit the whole game with impunity.   Edit: and the fix for this is to split the Lynx3 into 2 units, an affordable one with just the stingers and a pricey one with just the hellfires"
wargame,3di68y,Drahos,3,Thu Jul 16 15:19:07 2015 UTC,Also Commonwealth gets a lot of ASF options. The Tornados and Eurofighter are excellent.

wargame,3di68y,frankwouter,-2,Thu Jul 16 15:03:45 2015 UTC,Slower and not necessary heavier. Which is even worse.
wargame,3di68y,Saltysalad,2,Thu Jul 16 18:08:09 2015 UTC,The higher end challenger tanks all have relatively high armor for their price point. Also the challenger marksman.
wargame,3di68y,Otsid,3,Thu Jul 16 22:45:53 2015 UTC,"Commonwealth has many and varied unit choices but very few of them are elegant combinations or exceptional. I personally can't make it work compared to my other decks. In real life, the Commonwealth tended to rely upon semi-mobile, or towed options. These things don't fit into Wargame and leave a hole in the arsenal, most notable the lack of long range AA. Even the tracked Rapier was never intended for the British army.   Lets talk about their strengths, infantry with the best short range AT, the most heavy tanks on Blu for and the air forces.   The first is very niche, and leads to Commonwealth infantry generally being not cost effective when fighting other infantry, and lack dedicated infantry killers. They are pretty good though, notably Diggers, Canadian Airborne and Gurkhas. SAS are pretty exceptional too. There are some good LAV based transports and the Warrior is ok. The UK transports otherwise are pretty bland and expensive.   The second isn't terribly important, most coalitions have a very strong super heavy and while the Challenger 2 has the most armour in the game, it isn't really exceptional. The lower versions are pretty mediocre and expensive. Unfortunately for the Commonwealth, tanks are pretty straight forward to counter. My attempts to work with Commonwealth ran into the issue of losing these expensive tanks to planes, or helicopters. Commonwealth has great difficulty dealing with those, and won't outrange them. Therefore you will be punished really easily if you stray.  The final advantage is the RAF, RCAF, RAAF, the UK has 3 good Air superiority fighter options, Canada has one as well. Unfortunately air superiority is very points demanding, and can be quite risky, rng based and hard to use. The ~short loiter time makes this harder. You have some really good bomber and multi-role choices. F11C with the most powerful payload on Blu for, Harrier GR7 with 4x laser guided bombs. Unfortunately your opponent will adapt to air usage and you don't have much room for errors. This category is very limited in the number of cards you can pick.   As far as other categories, support has a lot of good choices for artillery, except you really want to take the Rapier FSA, Stormer and Challenger Marksman. The FSA is only good at shooting planes, with a very short anti-helicopter range, Stormer to provide an IR AA option and the Marksman to deal with helicopter rushes and to generally be very tanky. This is especially important without a ~good manpad outside of the expensive SAS."

wargame,3dixx2,SASinyourdoor,3,Thu Jul 16 17:21:44 2015 UTC,"The SEAD missiles are better on the prowler & raven but the ww adds versatility with its 4 aa missiles. For 100pts you get a decent sead and light aa aircraft multirole which is pretty good. The ww also fires 2 of its 4 sead missiles at a time, where as both the prowler & raven only fire 1 of their 2 missiles at a time."
wargame,3dixx2,Eurasian-HK,2,Thu Jul 16 17:38:43 2015 UTC,but wouldn't the 60% on the raven make it a much more viable seader? if i already have the ASF role covered?
wargame,3dixx2,Eurasian-HK,4,Thu Jul 16 17:42:25 2015 UTC,"yes, both the raven & prowler are better sead planes. Personally I take 1 card of 2 prowlers."
wargame,3dixx2,frankwouter,2,Thu Jul 16 17:46:07 2015 UTC,"It depends, the WW requires much less planning, because it keeps up with your other planes. The ripple fire also reduces you reliance on rng. The lack of stealth can even be an upside, since it forces enemy aa off, preventing damage to your good planes, vs the raven that is usually not spotted in time."
wargame,3dixx2,Alexandrite,3,Thu Jul 16 18:00:27 2015 UTC,"So the damage difference is irrelevant, since the only armored anti-air platform you'll likely see is the Polish WZT-1 NEWA, and that version of the NEWA lacks autonomy, so it's not too dangerous.  If you're just using your SEAD to get cheap kills like an opening sead cheese, then yeah the wild weasel is fine.  It's decently fast, it'll survive early game, and can pick off a couple spaags for a cheap price.  The scandi patch upgrade to the 4 missile platforms has significantly helped their previous fire rate and accuracy issues.  If you use your SEAD as intended, as in to protect a bombing run or to escort your fighter planes that need to engage across the map, what you care about is Range, Speed, ECM, and Accuracy.  In that case the EF-111 is probably the better pick, even with its expense.  In an Airborne deck if I get the option I typically go with a mix of expensive and cheap SEAD, but for everything else it just depends.  I generally favor the more expensive SEAD in other decks, since I rarely call that stuff out and when I do I need it to work as intended."
wargame,3dixx2,frankwouter,3,Thu Jul 16 17:50:26 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that Red dragons also has those cheap 7 armor radar gun spaags that survive wild weasel missiles and are often used to shield better radar aa.
wargame,3dixx2,Kappa043,2,Thu Jul 16 18:02:01 2015 UTC,"If you're running NORAD, you need Electric Voodoos. Best SEAD in the game for its price. For straight US, you really just want Prowlers- I don't find much use for such a high-value aircraft as the Raven, and I just don't think the WW's pros outweigh its cons."
wargame,3dixx2,Destruct1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:50:39 2015 UTC,I have no opinion on the 2vs4 missile debate. But I would never recommend a high end SEAD. If the enemy radar are on every SEAD will do its job flawlessly. If the enemy radar is off or you fuck up the low end seads have 2 per card and better survivability per cost.

Instead we just get waves of new players that mostly give up the game quickly and vets that get sick of the bad lobby system and give up eventually or hardly play. In other words a slowly dying game, instead of a stable game community that grows over time or at least stays fairly level for a long time.  Here's hoping they can figure it out before the next game but I wouldn't get my hopes up.  You really only need a very simple system.  There are basically only 3 or 4 tiers of players in RD (total noobs, casuals, veteran amateurs, competitive level).  It could just be a conscientious decision by Eugen as well.

Very good optics, right?   Try and always get at least one Exceptional optics, and hopefully this goes without saying, but put your ground recon RIGHT at the edge of forests etc, and weapons off infantry as far as you can safely push.   For commonwealth, you cant beat the cheap, plentiful 30pt LAV imo, only good optics but back up your inf recon and ferrets (if you really must) with them."

wargame,3dfj0i,Tanis_2589,2,Thu Jul 16 11:22:36 2015 UTC,"Commonwealth is not a great faction, but their recon is fantastic. Don't move recon infantry out in the open (unless they're really cheap and you just need them to draw out fire) because their stealth only works while in cover. Low accuracy ATGM vehicles like the Ferret are garbage so don't expect much out of them. ATGMs in Wargame are not the tank terrors that they are in real life.  Also, general rule of thumb, exceptional recon optics should be used near the front where everything will be hidden and you'll need the better optics to spot those same hidden units. Good optics should be used on flanks where you're unlikely to encounter much aside from transport helos trying to dump infantry behind enemy lines. And transport helos have terrible stealth so you don't need to spend 50-60 points just to see them.  Use the Gazelle AH.1 to support your tank pushes and other offensive roles, just don't push them to deep or else they'll get killed by AA. They're good because their exceptional optics allows them to see much further while having the mobility to support armored advances.  For defensive recon, use the exceptional recon optics rovers and ASLAVs. They are much better at remaining hidden then helos are and won't get killed by mortars or a sneaky Tunguska getting within range undetected by advancing under the cover a forest."

You should remove NZSAS and add Pathfinders, preferably in wheeled transport. C2A1 has only a 10th less DPS while deals 4 times more damage suppression than MG3. Also, remove Ferret and add Aslav-25 for a cheap autocannon. Exceptional recon helo wouldn't be bad either.  Your deck is flawed in so many ways. Your tank line-up has too many tanks at the bad 150-110 point price range, you have way too many infantry units in helo transports and generally speaking there's too many questionable choices. I reocmmend posting this to the deckbuilding thread to see for more improvements."
wargame,3dchl8,samoandragon,20,Wed Jul 15 04:50:33 2015 UTC,"I made a post back on Eugen forums, quite a while back with the same idea, it would make the AA net capable of keeping up, IFV's capable of driving besides infantry and fast helicopters able to follow your slower transport helicopters without going too far in front.

He proceeded to destroy all of the Fobs and then moved on to destroy the friendly cv. He also dropped a couple beacons where he was bombing, saying ""For the Motherland"" which tends to remove any doubt about it being accidental. At first i thought he had lagged or misclicked, but he destroys all of the blufor fobs with several airstrikes as well as the blufor cv in the spawn zone. Blufor players begin to quit en masse, and then at that point the replay ends because I left.

wargame,3defwx,Orcbuster32,3,Thu Jul 16 03:01:51 2015 UTC,Check out the max distance of a flame tank IRL. It is not an indirect fire weapon due to basic fluid physics.
wargame,3defwx,FlightOfTheAlbatross,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:19:11 2015 UTC,"Good point; they didn't have the range Eugen gives them (just a few hundred meters). It's trajectory is similar to a Mk.19, which fires in an low arc (lower angle than artillery of course, and less than in Wargame), but is technically considered an indirect fire system. I agree that it wouldn't go over buildings like a rainbow of death, but I think the flame would have the pressure and conical dispersion to extend beyond LOS (conceived as a point to point straight line).   That said, if Eugen consciously chose to limit it to bring it closer to real life, I could get on board with that. FWIW, I think it's the way it is for no other reason than what FlightOfTheAlbatross described."
wargame,3defwx,zman122333,3,Wed Jul 15 21:21:41 2015 UTC,"In fact, they used to be able to fire without line of sight back in W:EE. It was pretty horrible; napalm vehicles dominated the forest meta. Shame that they lost a lot of utility, but Eugen made the call to nerf them post-release because it wasn't all that fun."
wargame,3defwx,flightwusel,2,Wed Jul 15 19:57:53 2015 UTC,You can sort of get around this by selecting FIRE POS as far in the direction you want to fire as possible.  The flames will often overshoot their intended target.  But yeah I generally agree they shouldn't be an finicky when trying to use them.
wargame,3defwx,Aeweisafemalesheep,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:41:36 2015 UTC,"The LOS stuff is ridiculous. But sometimes they can open you a door.

wargame,3d6yu8,ScopionSniper,3,Tue Jul 14 23:00:56 2015 UTC,"Don't forget about the slow missile speed. If a tank with a decent enough accuracy (50% and up is usually enough) engages an ATGM carrier at ranges below the max range of its main gun (2275m!) the tank will win the engagement 100% percent of the time. Seriously, it doesn't even matter if the ATGM carrier gets the first shot off and the missile is already in the air halfway to its target, the moment the tank fires its gun the ATGM carrier is dead. It's nearly instant, that's how fast it is. Which is ridiculous, the velocity of most rounds fired from tank guns in real life is anywhere from 500 m/s to 700 m/s. Compare that to ATGMs where the velocity is typically 200 m/s to 400 m/s. ATGMs in Wargame typically take around 6 seconds to reach its target at max range which, imo, is a fairly realistic amount of time, but not very realistic when tank rounds have almost no travel time when they should really take 3 or 4 seconds to reach their target.  So you have this narrow 350m window where your ATGM carrier can actually do something without instantly getting blown up. And only on the more open maps where there aren't any LOS blocking trees, towns, or difficult hilly terrain are where you can exploit the extra range an ATGM has. That's terrible and only on the more boring desert-type maps and rural farmland-type maps do you get this kind of openness.  ATGMs carriers like the BRDM Konkurs, M901 ITV, or the AMX HOT need to have severe amounts of buffing to be actually useful, let alone actually be terrifying threats to armor like they are in real life. Give them all medium stealth like recon vehicles (Since when does a BRDM-2 have better stealth than a BRDM Konkurs? Or the recon variants of the M113 having better stealth than the M901?), a 175m range increase to all ATGMs below 2800 meters, and cheaper prices based on the accuracy of the ATGM. For example, the ATGM carriers armed with Milans, Fagots, Malyutka-Ps, or HOT 1 missiles should get price decreases while the TOWs and Chu-MATs should stay the same. And give price increases (note not decreases) to both the BMP-3 and Bradley M2A2 while giving them the same stealth and range increases all other ATGM carriers get. At 35 points each there is literally no reason to take any other ATGM carrier in the game, seriously they get better armor and actually useful auto cannons as well! IMO, they should be 50 points each like the MTLB Shturm and Humvee TOW-2."
wargame,3d6yu8,idealisticcynicist,5,Tue Jul 14 23:02:55 2015 UTC,"Actually tank guns in real life fire anywhere from 900 to 1800 meters per second. The SU-76 which is included in the Wargame is the bottom end, with around 680 m/s muzzle velocity. Early tanks like the centurion, M48 and T-55 all have muzzle velocities in the thousand meter per second range, with newer ammo that goes up even more (with KE ammo going up to 1500 m/s) Same goes for the 105 mm armed tanks.  On the other hand the smoothbore guns of T-62 onwards and of 120 mm NATO have muzzle velocities in excess of 1500 m/s (the T-62 had a muzzle velocity of 1600 m/s with the APFSDS ammo when it appeared), some ammunition even reaching 1800 m/s which would bring the travel time to around a second and a smidgeon."

It's not relevant at all.   if a tank and a 5 pt apc with the best atgm in the game on it (Milan3?) are 1000m away from each other in a field then the tanks should win.   Well, first of all, the Milan F3 is far, far from being ""the best atgm in the game"". Second, no 5 point transports in game get ATGMs, and I never mentioned anything about making any ATGM carriers as cheap as 5 points. Third, the Milan F3 is not mounted on any ATGM carrier in game and Eugen as already stated they are not adding in any new units in Wargame. Fourth, it doesn't have to be 1000 meters away for a tank to be able to instant kill an ATGM carrier, right now it's 2275 meters. That doesn't give an ATGM carrier a lot of room to engage an enemy tank barreling down a road at 110km/h.  Speaking of France and its ATGM carriers, you get 4 extremely low accuracy, low-range, and overpriced ATGM carriers. The AMX HOT (45 points) with the 40% accuracy HOT 1 missile, VAB Mephisto (40 points, again armed with the shitty HOT 1 missile), 35% accuracy Milan 1s mounted on the AMX-10P (30 points), and the crappy 5 health, 40% accuracy Milan 2 jeep (25 points). All are terrible for the price especially when compared to the 20 points, 60% accuracy Chu-Mat jeep, 35 points, 70% accuracy Bradley M2A2, and 2800m, 35 points, 50% accuracy BMP-3.

I was thinking of best statwise. but bc i only play russian decks currently i don't know what is the best.  I don't understand why a tank should lose to an atgm. where is it written that that must be true. once you explain that we can talk nuances.
wargame,3d6yu8,mrwizard70,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:07:59 2015 UTC,"The majority of ATGMs in real life can engage targets 4 or even 5 kilometers away. The M1 Abrams, for example, can only effectively engage targets 3 KM away. In real life, this gives huge advantages to ATGMs and you can watch many videos from the Syrian civil war which show ATGMs knocking out those export T-72As the Syrian Army is equipped with.  The problem is that in Wargame, for the sake of balance, ATGM range has been so severely gimped that tanks can simply fast move down a road and within 10 or so seconds cover the difference in range. It's especially apparent when the AI exploits this and just balls out rushes your line of ATGMs killing them all without taking many losses.  In a standup fight, if a tank is able to spot an ATGM carrier and they both fire at eachother at the same time, the tank should theoretically win. However, real life ATGM carriers are much, much more difficult to spot then in Wargame especially when concealed or in the hull down position. Their smaller size allows them to take advantage of cover easier than tanks and they don't need their engines running (which give off a thermal signature) to fire their ATGM as it does not need power to rotate and move like a tank turret does. All of this is not simulated in Wargame and the moment an ATGM carrier fires its ATGM at a tank that is in range to return fire, the ATGM carrier gets revealed from the fog of war and instantly killed. Since the game revolves around cost-efficiency and most of the games that are played are destruction, seeing your 40 or 50 point ATGM carrier kill absolutely nothing is very bad for your score and just feeds the enemy points. That's why, aside from a select few ATGM carriers that are actually good, almost no one takes them. A BRDM Konkurs or a Humvee TOW-2 are nowhere near as essential to a light infantry force in Wargame as they are in real life. That's why I believe the bad ATGM carriers in game should receive severe amounts of buffing, and, no, even with the buffs that I propose they will still lose a dedicated tank rush. The buffs just make them usable, that's all."

In addition, there should be some more balancing for ATGMs:   long-range launches perhaps shouldn't always reveal the unit to the enemy ATGMs shouldn't be able to fire through a second line of hedges/forest, only out of them tanks should have auto-smoke defences Perhaps the range of certain ATGMs should be extended.

Also really hard to prevent blob warfare and such.  4k would turn the game into an atgm spam filled campfest (on open maps). A stealth level inbetween medium and poor would be a beter solution.

Tankers are most afraid of infantry then cannot see. Shot in the back of the turret at close range from a house, bang. Happens a lot in Iraq and Syria. Abrams tanks can only shoot accurately at things they know exist. Visibility is far more important than arbitrary short ranges, and real terrain is not pancake flat like Wargame in most places.  Real war is not unplayable. It goes on regardless of long ranges. While it would be good if long ranges stopped people fighting, they have not."

wargame,3d6yu8,frankwouter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:00:11 2015 UTC,"for starters, each block is pretty much the range of an RPG-7v, so yeah, inf micro is bad enough as is, so smaller blocks would create more problems than they would solve. in the design of the game, the compressed ranges are kind of central to the balance, so in order to change that, everything would need rebalanced... stealth levels, recon, speeds... it would be as intensive as making a new game. I get where you are coming from, I hate how ineffectual ATGM squads are, but it is better than having them overpowered, and a balance between the two extremes is pretty impossible."

It is also possible in current game and might be hard to do in the game engine.   I don't mind the current atgm balance. They are cheap and hit hard, but fragile and bad when under fire. I rarely see games withouth atgms being used.   The thing that could be done would be a buff to Milan 1 and compare pos atgms. The price gap between them and the usefull stuff like Milan 2 is too small and makes them unusable.   Also a fire control system or optics failure also disables a weapon for the entire engagement."

wargame,3d4mkw,guyinthecap,6,Mon Jul 13 14:12:13 2015 UTC,"Use them as recon.  Garrison them in a building in a good area to spot is a great idea.  Defending depends on which shock recon you're using  I usually use US Rangers, as other nations actually have shock infantry. When I use the Rangers, they're supporting other infantry. I usually protect them more than anything else, to make sure I have eyes on the field."
wargame,3d4mkw,onewithoutasoul,5,Mon Jul 13 14:20:13 2015 UTC,"I almost always open with them, so that when I make contact I'll see more of the enemy force and know what to buy next"

wargame,3d4mkw,Jasperjons,2,Mon Jul 13 15:12:00 2015 UTC,I generally treat shock recon squads as recon squads that can defend themselves. I'll deploy them in combat zones to provide recon in situations I know will soon become contested. This is very general however and shock recon squads have taken on a new character in some decks.  For example your rangers are used by some people as decent city fight infantry in a deck that lacks good shock infantry in fast transports. Rangers can be relied upon to kill other infantry until the Marines get there.   Another good example of a unit used differently is pruzcumnici for the Czechs. 10 man squad with sniper rifle. They have a range advantage and a suppression advantage vs most other iinfantry. Their sniper rifle allows them to sit back a block behind and still contribute to the fight in some situations. I will use them in 2 stacks to move around in a city fight and stun enemy stacks while  my motostrelci and vysadkari do the real fighting.  More than anything else shock recon give you more options. Shock recon generally has a better launcher too so they can more reliably kill vehicles.
wargame,3d4mkw,frankwouter,2,Mon Jul 13 14:25:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is very helpful."
wargame,3d4mkw,Paladin_G,2,Mon Jul 13 15:11:41 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the deck. In some decks, they are your only shock inf and then could used as shock inf with limited availability.  They serve as recom/combat inf hybrid in my other decks. It gives me free recon for an infantry force withouth losing firepower. And they are almost always a better deal then normal recon inf if you get them in 5 pts trucks."
wargame,3d4mkw,nated0ge,2,Mon Jul 13 14:37:16 2015 UTC,"It depends on the specific unit.   Some are basically just recon infantry that might be able to mess something up that comes their way that's weaker than them.   Others are more or less essential parts of your deck, and synergize really well with the rest of your infantry. For example, I find mixing one or two squads of Rangers to be very useful in USA/NORAD decks in towns. Put the Rangers on the outskirts to spot stuff for the your other infantry or vehicles that are nearby, let them do a little damage, and pull them back when they start taking hits."
wargame,3d4mkw,Augzz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:44:17 2015 UTC,"In my 1v1 US deck, I only have 1 card of Stingers in my infantry tab.  I use Rangers and SEALs for my infantry with 1 Longbow. So far its been suprisingly effective. In my Czech deck the shock Recon is also incredibly good, as well as Spetnaz GRU and SBS. So whenever possible I try to use the Shock/Elite Recon to do infantry fights because they are so cost effective. I know many will say its stupid/overkill, but in 1v1 this is a very strong tactic as having good optics, good camo and the extreme lethality of Elite/Shock will often get a good ambush off, giving you a point edge in smaller games."

IR Weapons Overhaul: Make IR weapons not affected by ECM, but instead use Size/Stealth for the accuracy modifier. This would make IR missiles (Sidewinders and R60Ms) far more useful than its current state. an increase in range of turn radius; ie. increments of 25, rather than 50, for variety.  A Gun re-work similar to IR. Should be a combo of size and stealth, rather than ECM.

Currently, a ""squad"" is just a vehicle unit with different attributes and multiple model instances.  In most RTS games that have squads, the soldier is the unit and is then grouped with other soldiers to form a squad, usually allowing the squad to take cover behind objects and do other things such as spreading out.   Proper single-player modes and features   I would like to see the return of scripted campaigns like in EE, reasonable AI that can do basic tactics such as flanking and not bunching units for an easy airstrike, a challenge mode and all options available in sp skirmish."

wargame,3d1owz,Saltysalad,3,Sun Jul 12 22:53:24 2015 UTC,Bonuses is the plural.
wargame,3d1owz,KILLER5196,2,Sun Jul 12 23:13:27 2015 UTC,"Regarding Latin spelling, second declension nominative masculine Latin endings for the singular and plural are ""-us"" and ""-i"" respectively; and never -ii.  Combine these endings with the root word: ""bon-"", and you get bon-us and bon-i, but not bon-ii.  Only for a word whose root already ends with an i (such as sagittari-us) could you have a double-i (as in sagittari-i).  On a grammatical-ish note, the Latin word ""bonus, boni"" is typically used as an adjective that means 'good, honest, brave, noble, etc'.  When used as a noun, it means 'good/moral/honest/brave man, man of honor, gentlemen', and either meaning technically makes the sentence nonsensical.    The word ""bonum, boni"", however, would work here since it is a noun that means 'good, good thing, advantage'.  The plural of which is 'bona'."

For instance, a stack of four has better base morale and better morale recovery than a stack of two.  However, grouping is a double edged sword as an impact on the morale of any unit will affect the rest of this group. For instance, even if only one unit in a stack of four was panicked and was under fire, the rest of the group would at least be worried. Also, one stunned unit can slow down the rest of the group (even though the rest of the group will keep going).  Finally, (this part is speculation) units with low morale will recover morale faster if you group them with units that have a higher morale."

wargame,3cxgbs,a_grated_monkey,2,Mon Jul 13 18:28:45 2015 UTC,"If that deck is working for you for killing AI, then that's fine. But, AI is nothing like multiplayer.  So the PZG '90 in Marder 2's are a good start. Marder 2's are one of the few infantry vehicles that are really useful after they've dropped off their infantry.  I would drop the other stacks of PZG '75. If you get Jager's in Tpz Fuchs, then you have a very good unit. The MG3 makes Regular training Jagers a force to be reckoned with, and taking them in the Fuchs gives you a lot of them, which makes more MG3's, which is very hard to kill. However, if you like your shock troop and autocannon vehicles, you can keep them. It makes a good forest combo. I would say upgrade them to PZG '90 because the Panzerfaust 3 AT weapon is one of the best in the game.  I would drop the other stack of PZG's though and replace them with Fallschirmjagers '90. The G-11 carbine + MG3 melts other infantry. The PZF 3 is one of the best in the game, like I said earlier.  The PALR Milan I would recommend dropping, and replace it with either more Jagers in m113 or PZG '90 in M113 for a plentiful but slow, good infantry. Or you can leave it blank for more slots later.  Support tab, I would take Flakpz. Gepard A2's because they come with Stinger missiles, which allows you to still use them when SEAD comes by, and against other planes and against helis it does extremely well.  I would drop LARS and get MARS, which gives you a Smerch basically.  Other artillery is good if that's what you like. LARS can be extremely fun if you call out all 7 units because it can REDFOR a taste of their own medicine. It'll basically be a super Grad but it's very FOB heavy. If you still want to take it, then I would drop the heavy guns for it. Howver, heavy guns are very useful in some situations a LARS would not be. LARS is very useful to panic enemy infantry before an assault, thus rendering it easier to kill them.  If the mortars are not 120mm, then get those instead.  Leo2A5 is a good superheavy.  Drop 1 card of Leo2A1, and both cards of 1A5.  Get a card of Kpz 70 Keiler, which has an autocannon, which makes it very good at killing enemy infantry. It is an excellent forest fighting vehicle.  Get a card of 2A4 for a good heavy, but not superheavy tank.   That's probably all the tanks you need.  Recon BGS is good, but don't use them to fight like other SF infantry.  Drop recon tank, get Spz Luchs A1.   Keep Tiger.   Try to find an exceptional optics vehicle, I don't know if they have one.  Wiesel tow 2 is good for AT, but has horrible range. It will need refueling.  If you want anti infantry, I would say get the VTSI or the M42 duster that is the german variant. Flakpz M42.  For heli, I would get one of the stinger carrying heli's.  For airplane, the tornado IDS is more destructive than Alpha Jet's.  Make sure you don't expose your Tornado ECR anymore than you have to."

Strela-3 is bad, you have decent IR AA even without it. I'd take one more Výsadkáři, maybe non-90, those are better against infantry. Air: You might want to consider an ASF, MiG-23ML is good. L-29 is bad, I would drop that. Also L-39ZA is your main anti-longbow weapon, keep that in mind. Vehicle: I would add TO-55. Situational, but very effective.  Tanks: T-72S is kinda bad, for 40 points you get just 2 AP and 3 FAV over T-72M1M. I'd take more T-72M1M instead. Moderna is enough for dealing with heavy tanks that the M1M can't destroy.

It seems paradoxical, but it's actually better than the Strela-3. They have the same HE damage, and although the Strela-3 has a longer range and higher accuracy, it costs twice as much. Imagine if the Stinger C cost twice as much as the Stinger A- you wouldn't take it. This is a similar situation. For 20 points (plus transports) you can get a 4-stack of Strela-2, versus 40 for the Strela-3. And 4 missiles, even Strela-2 missiles, is nothing to scoff at. You're nearly guaranteed to hit something that you fire a salvo towards at least once, especially when shooting at helicopters.  Or maybe try the Strela-10M or the Strop 2 instead."

I managed to remove or damage a lot of SF and Shock infantry just in time for my Motos and Granatomets to arrive and reinforce them. I used a Kolos to heal my early deployed units while my regular troops did the clean up. To be honest I did miss the Strelas because although I did manage to set up a pretty heavy AA net, killing a lot of planes and choppers, I found myself unable to snipe certain units because of LOS issues. Lucky me, my partner had his igla teams. (I was not death stacking but playing against one)."

In cities use motos and granatOPmets  I dont need an ASF. It has a super specialised role and the czech ones are bad. I rather get more bombers or more units.  I use rocket arty because If you saturate an área you will kill anything lightly armored. It deals damage faster than a dana.   Strelas are bad but I dont have anything better.

It costs the same and has the same avail on nearly every unit. I bring my Specjed 90 and Lictor Pictor in them most of the time, for great justice.  As for ASF, if I need to shoot down planes I prefer to use pairs of AVIA MiG-19s. They defeat Rafales and Typhoons with alarming regularity."

It will kill any air unit that comes anywhere near it and you'll never see MANPADS ever again. You have the most maximized lineup of AAA in your support tab already.  If you're having troubles that you need MANPADS, then you're doing it wrong.  Also Czech heavy tube arty is one of the best in game, so I'll drop that RM-70 like a hot potato."

It's 15 points more than the Konkurs-M BRDM and has 13 front armor. You use them with your other tanks to compensate for their weaknesses and not as infantry support, that's what the granatomats are for.  If I take two cards of SF I usually take one in the choppers for fast deploy and the other in motorized to keep the cost down. You can get one on the table for 45 (or 35 if you like to live dangerously, as I do) instead of 60.  If you keep the Mi-4's I'd say ditch the Mi-25 S-4. It's ATGM isn't gonna hit anything.

Trash the inf bradley, upvet the recce bradley, get some LR90 or delta for the specific maps that allow them to be played. Don't forget that tow2vee is a fine alt that allows you to be dynamic. I find the 3 cmnd only to be worrying. Not being able to double up cmnds when desperation bombing starts in close games can hurt. And don't forget that NK and sovs can  throw cheap shit planes at the longbow for 1 pass kills. You don't need to land grab so much as you want to deny land grab. But if you do want to land grab a specific map you can open LR90+BH+DAP alone or mix in a single recce cobra to help rather than use rangers."

wargame,3cxgbs,Cole7rain,5,Mon Jul 13 01:31:27 2015 UTC,"I believe after the last few balance patches the US has become the strongest BLUEFOR deck (shout out to Motorized NORAD though), in large part due to the 5 extra activation points you get over coalitions. Those 5 extra activation points allow you to get away with having 5 cards of planes without poking any major holes in the rest of your deck, which is further justified by the fact that the US air force is quite well rounded.  American deck for 2v2, 3v3, & 4v4 (Screencap)  BPgQYHYBZIcycRgG4lTrJVJY1QeQySE6AkIxckslANBKUSoqXtJ8U7QaGPlISj9R4bMSonTRcTrR2dLNVgFBUhBVt7G09A==  LOGI:    Ever since the price buff to command tanks, they are easily worth having in your deck. The CMD M1 Abrams is particularly good as it has 3 top armor for only 160 points.   INFANTRY:   US Marines '90 in LVTP-7A1s. This combination speaks for itself, exceptionally effective in forest fighting. Riflemen '90 just for the M2A2 Bradley, up-vetted for increased accuracy on the TOW-2. Remember, if you're using an ATGM at 2275m or less, you're doing it wrong as good players will specifically target the Bradleys before engaging your tanks. You should instead simply position them somewhere behind your tanks where they can quickly be called upon to provide fire support. This tactic is especially devastating to the enemy in battles between super heavy tanks. Delta Force are only 25 points, and in my experience they are worth that cost regardless of the fact that they are inferior to other elite infantry. If you look at them as just really good shock infantry and use them as such, you will find they aren't so disappointing. The US deck is all about combined arms any ways, and the way I usually deal with Spetsnaz or Formoza is by going around them. If you put enough pressure on the flanks of a REDFOR player, you will find they won't actually be able to afford enough infantry to entirely kick you out of the urban center. Assault Engineers use the M202 Flash, which in urban block-to-block range is the highest DPS napalm launcher in the game (0.857 HE/s). The Spetsnaz RPO Rys DPS is only 0.667 HE/s in comparison, but to be fair it does do 3.2x as much suppression damage. A combination of Delta Force and Assault Engineers is quite a potent force in urban combat. For me it was between Assault Engineers and SMAW troops, and it's something I'm still in debate over. I used to think it was a no-brainer (SMAW), but I've started using assault engineers in stacks of 4 and the results are spectacular. LAAD Stinger C manpads, don't mess around with the Stinger A. 20% accuracy is a world of difference for only 5 points and minor hit to availability.    SUPPORT:    ATACMS... because ATACMS. I prefer the longer range and heavier mortars on the M106A2. The longer range keeps them out of range of enemy recon, thus making them harder to counter battery.  Avengers for their speed, which is especially helpful at the very beginning of a match. The short range of the stinger is compensated by the exceptional stabilization, allowing you to get in range of enemy helicopters at the start of a game by fast moving down the road. The M48A3 Chaparral is the best tool for dealing with enemy helicopters, the fact that it's amphibious cements it as a must-have in any US deck IMO. 1 veteran Patriot. The reason I take 1 veteran Patriot over 2 trained is because I feel if you're going to buy a 120 pt. unit with 4 missiles that can ONLY fire at airplanes, it better damn well hit. I very rarely lose my Patriot if I'm playing my best, but I don't recommend new players take a veteran Patriot as it can be very easy to forget to turn your Radar off. It's also necessary to constantly relocate your Patriot as good REDFOR players will often be trying to hit it with SMERCH & Artillery.   TANK:   13 M8 AGS. I'm still not sure about these, sometimes they feel dirty and overpowered and other times they feel like a waste of money. I do feel they are better at defending than they are at attacking, simply because getting the first shot off will give the enemy another accuracy debuff on top of the 10% debuff associated with the ""small"" size of the M8 AGS. For example a T-72B1 may have it's accuracy lowered to as low as 35% before it ever gets a chance to shoot back, meaning the M8 AGS is actually well armored in the sense that it can be very difficult to hit. I still haven't used them nearly enough to make a final judgement, but I'm considering trading them for some more heavy tanks, specifically the M1A1(HC). 9 M1IP. Still pretty good even after the price nerf. Very good at leading a charge, or if you're feeling bold you can send them behind your heavy tanks and then retreat the heavy tank once it's taken too much damage. This works because of the speed of the M1IP, which allows you to abuse the mechanics of KE weapons. You will essentially be baiting the enemy into chasing your heavy tanks with his to try to finish them off, meanwhile your M1IPs are simultaneously advancing forward and before the enemy has fully grasped what you're doing it's already too late. 3 M1A1(HC). Self explanatory. Super heavy tanks are under-rated by new and less experienced players. 1 veteran M1A2. Most people will scoff at the idea of sacrificing the other M1A2 and I definitely don't recommend new players do this, but I'm damn good at keeping my super heavies alive all game long. The most common way to lose a super heavy is to gunship helicopters and anti-tank planes, but I'm always stunning MIG-27s with my Patriot and there is rarely a moment when I don't have a Chaparral escorting my tanks. The M1A2 has 24 AP so if any tank is worth the accuracy bonus it's this one. I know a lot of people will say ""but tanks like that will vet themselves up anyways"", but I feel the opening stages of the game are too important to have your most critical assets missing their shots. With that said, that's just my justification and in no way does that mean I think it's the ""right choice"". The decision can also be affected by whether or not you're playing a 500, 750, or 1000 pt. conquest game.   RECON:   RANGERS. Every deck should have a card of cheap high availability recon infantry, and I would go as far as saying recon infantry are the most powerful asset in the game. 4 Veteran RANGERS in UH-60A BLACKHAWKS. These are for when I'm opening with a helicopter rush. The reason I take them as Veteran is because I don't really need more than 4, and the bonuses could mean the difference between success and failure in the critical opening stages of the game. Not to mention the veterancy optics bonus is something most people forget to factor in when it comes to recon infantry. 4 Hardened M3A2 Bradley CFV. A medium stealth TOW-2 carrier, what's not to like? I take it Hardened because I just can't imagine a game in which I would need 7 of these things. AH-64D LONGBOW. Self explanatory, the reason I don't take it at higher veterancy is because helicopters are just really fragile and even the best players will lose them.   VEHICLE:   9 Hardened COMVAT. It's kind of like a shitty Marder 2, and even a shitty Marder 2 would have it's uses. Don't underestimate this unit, and try to abuse the fact that it's range is 1925m. Again, taken at hardened veterancy because I just can't imagine buying 13 of these things in a single game.   HELO:   MH-60L DAP. This thing screams ""'Murika!!"", and ever since the changes it's now a must have in all of my US decks. DO NOT underestimate how powerful these are in a helicopter rush, I usually buy 3 of them with a Longbow and a few Rangers in Blackhawks. The trick to these is NOT to use attack move! Simply keep them flying forward towards the enemy, that way they won't rear up like stallions. They are only 60 points so it's pretty difficult to trade inefficiently with these things.   2 Hardened AH-1W Supercobra. These are good, just don't use them in a chopper rush. You want to keep logistics near by so you don't have to fly back to your FOB every time you use your AIM-9Ms. I find myself rarely buying these because the TOW-2 is redundant when you have the Longbow available, but if you do need a highly mobile AA platform these are your best bet.   PLANE:   F-4S PHANTOM II. One of the best napalm planes in the game. For me it was between this and the Nighthawk, and I found I just prefer the utility of napalm. 2 Veteran AV-8B HARRIER II. The F/A-18C HORNET is more expensive, and because of the veterancy bonuses I find the Harrier gets the job done as reliably as the Hornet. The combination of the slower top speed and the 6000 r/m GAU-12/A Equalizer means the Harrier is significantly better at killing helicopters. I also find the Hornet takes significantly longer to re-arm and refuel. I'm still experimenting with this choice, but so far I've been very surprised by the performance of the Harrier. F-15D Eagle. 'Murika! Don't underestimate the ability the F-15D Eagle has to kill enemy bombers. While it's no SU-27M, the F-15D is still considered one of the few true multi-role planes in this game (meaning it's actually good at both roles). F-15C Eagle. If I were the type of guy to buy more than 1 ASF I'd take the Block-52, but I don't so I take the F-15C Eagle. The Eagle also has two extra AIM-9Ms, which is a much bigger deal than you might think. EF-111A RAVEN. I used to take the Prowler like most people (it looks like a cute little dolphin!), but as I've gotten better at the game I find myself rarely losing my Raven. The speed and stealth of the Raven are just invaluable for those high level mind games one can play with the enemy. The Raven's combination of 'GOOD' stealth, much higher speed, and slightly longer range on it's missiles results in a much smaller window of time for your enemy to turn his Radar off."
wargame,3cxgbs,Aeweisafemalesheep,10,Sun Jul 12 02:40:05 2015 UTC,"Inf line up here is pretty silly. You have some redundancies. And the upvet super heavy is just flatout stupid outside of 1v1.    Smaw+lvtpa1 is the right choice for a 5 man, frankly probably the only 5man next to rdmoto using tanke85 because you get the a1 to nade spam while a couple of smaw can do some dps. These also play forests well with rifle spam in the a3 for when you need fodder.  If you want to wreck face in a city you can take a card of seals and mix things up. If you have LR90 then you can do AOD on maps like gunboat. Delta are fine for specific situations but the core has to be there and your current choices will result in a bad day vs good players.    I wouldn't upvet the patriot just due to sead being very meta and organized red playerrs using strike packages more than ever with cheap sead ahead and behind.    For recon an actual recon helo would help but if someone else is doing that for you then that's fine. YOu have the bradley here ergo you dont need it in inf. But you do need seals and lav25's are great too.    You really don't need the supercobra. You already have the best helo a2a in the game and can run an avenger to flank guard in a big game. Harrier is a secondary pick for an ATGM heavy strategic choice. It can do things well but it has to dive at a tank. F&F means you can dive or you can come in from an angle, blast a tank, and even possibly side shot another in a pass. It's the superior choice. Both are great when not going bomb heavy. Issue with the raven is the reload time takes forever. High tier players have switched over to the WW due to its speed and utility."
wargame,3cxgbs,Cole7rain,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:27:01 2015 UTC,"Inf line up here is pretty silly. You have some redundancies.   After thinking about it I think I agree SMAW teams are a little too good not to have in a US Deck, so I'm willing to sacrifice the 35 pt. Bradley for them. But for the rest can you be more specific? My line of thinking is:   US Marines '90/LVTP-7A1 = Forest fighting Delta Force & Assault Engineers = Urban combat    And the upvet super heavy is just flatout stupid outside of 1v1.   You can't just say something like that without backing it up, especially when my justifications have been clearly explained.   I wouldn't upvet the patriot...organized red playerss using strike packages more than ever with cheap sead ahead and behind.   This kind of tactic is exactly what the Patriot is good against, and if players are losing their Patriot to SEAD it's either because they aren't being mindful of such tactics or they are not abusing the 5600m range. This kind of tactic also requires a large investment, meaning they will have weakness in some other aspect of their play. Not to mention these cheap SEAD planes have shorter range missiles and much lower ECM themselves, I've killed these SEAD planes with my Patriot. I'm not saying it isn't risky to upvet the Patriot, I'm just saying the risk comes with equal reward. Up-vetting units is an investment in the early game, it's an aggressive play and yes it is risky which is why I specifically recommended against new players trying it.   For recon an actual recon helo   I think I know what you're talking about but cheaper recon helicopters are not meant to sit as static observers of the front line (unless they have 'GOOD' stealth like the German Tiger). Using them as such is just a crutch players develop because they are too lazy to micro recon infantry. Cheap recon helicopters are meant for tracking enemy movement in the opening stages of the game, observing the large open flanks on many maps, and at most temporarily observing the front line during an offensive. The longbow serves 2/3 of those roles, and as far as putting cheap recon helicopters on the open flanks I prefer to rely on cheap AA at my spawn along with a few transports dotted around the perimeter. That's enough to deal with any small helo or SF incursions, and the pressure I put on the middle of the map prevents the enemy from succeeding with any ""super cheese"" (like helicopter spam around the sides of the map).   But you do need seals and lav25's are great too   Normally I have 5 cards of recon in my US deck, but like I said there are some sacrifices I made to have 5 cards of planes. Elite Recon infantry are a luxury item, and Navy Seals themselves are entirely over-rated (their suppression damage doesn't hold a candle to Formoza or Spetsnaz). With that said they ARE still useful so I would fit them in if I could, but I've already got Delta Force & Assault Engineers anyway. As far as the LAV25, I generally don't feel motorized openings openings are a strong point of the US Deck, so I don't really need a motorized recon vehicle. I have a motorized NORAD deck for that purpose, and even then I'm using the Coyote.   You really don't need the supercobra.   Of course not, but I had 2 points left over and nothing in the vehicle tab really seems appetizing.   F&F... it's the superior choice.   I agree in the context of someone needing the most reliable tank-buster, but this deck has many other ways of killing super heavies (ATACMS, Longbow, Bradley, SMAW, M1A2/M1A1(HC). Like I said I'm enjoying the cheaper price of the Harrier and it's ability to reliably kill helicopters in a single pass. The Harrier fires 6157 r/m @ at 49.6% accuracy due to the veterancy bonus. Also to my surprise a few days ago I finished off a T-72BU with one missile and side-shotted a T-80UM as I was evacuating, so the Harrier is capable of multiple kills if the first target is already heavily damaged. Not saying this wasn't a little lucky, but the veterancy bonuses did come into play there.   High tier players have switched over to the WW due to its speed and utility.   If the Wild Weasel had AIM-9Ms I could get on board with this, but it doesn't. The Wild Weasel is a multi-role plane, and like many multi-role planes it's terrible at both roles. The combination of 'POOR' stealth and shit-tier SEAD missile range means it's only going to be effective against players who need a lot of work on their Radar micro."
wargame,3cxgbs,Aeweisafemalesheep,3,Mon Jul 13 03:12:44 2015 UTC,"assaults auto die to any and all aoe and they have no power in forest combat. If they were 10 man it might be a different story. Better off with rifle spam. Marines are playable but the price of entry is much to high as general purpose. Their one of those extra style choices after the core. With rifle90+a3's you have recon by fire (think pushing from open field to forest edge) and decent AT. You can spam city blocks too while navy seals and/or whatever else do work(PF if norad, delta, whatever). With a1+smaw you have an infantry and tank murder combo perfect for forests and smaw have decent enough range to do some work around cities(they can fire from a block or two back and side blocks kinda like gru or JSDF rangers can play a towns edge), but expect a1 to do lifting that will vomit grenades all over inf including naders. In forests back up with your choice ontos, 1ip, m8ags to have a more complete composition. Cev, cs, comvat work well there as a cherry on top.       When a strike package with B5 is done even if you manage to kill a leading cheap sead plane the b5 still do their job and you can get booped by a middle or tail end of the pack.    Actually there are tons of places on different maps where recon helos simply sit above forests and see mostly everything in the open. You can have all the 10-25 point recon in the world sitting on a forests edge but they still don't get the freedom that comes with sitting above LOS blockers. Plus, suicide sentry has its uses when needing to maintain LOS on a target or to exploit a hole for a quick car find for that juicy score to win.  Fast open that I see working is upvet lr90 and seals into what i mentioned above. LR90 can actually deal with stuff like BTR90 in pairs, otherwise pairs or LAV-25 upvet can do more open combat (a  bush for the first shot is prefered) against stuff like btr90 and 80a. After the law nerf i've watched delta at elite just fail to point blank high end btr using gru, even from a city block. It's silly and disappointing when it's reoccouring. Frankly, i've never had issues with spetz at all.  And i understand the want to do a slower game. Slowly pushing with US is strong.  super hornet is not about luck at all really. It has the base stats needed and frankly as USA you need all the tank killing tools possible to take on something like SKA but no one should be losing big things to ATACMs. Somethings very wrong if they're sleeping and losing to that now. Think about this: 70 point 203's for smashing a fortress area with high alpha and dual atgm plane instead to punish everything mobile.     off the top of my head instead of a a2a cobra, 45/60 point cobra for ride of the valk clumps. Ontos, tow2vee, cs, cev, flame m113. All solid.      That's funny because I see WW's used only at the top tier combined with faster or equal speed planes to do work on larger and taller maps. The basic logic is you're not paying a ton and you can keep running them. Missiles are a cherry on top vs red low ecm solutions. From my personal experience when implementing ravens against teams the question of ""do you"" or ""does anyone have sead up?"" resulted in too many ""No"" responses to keep up presure even if it was purchased within the first 5-7mins."
wargame,3cxgbs,Cole7rain,-2,Mon Jul 13 04:37:38 2015 UTC,"Rifle spam, price of entry too high, recon by fire, 70 point 203's, LR90, 45/60 point cobra for ride of the valk clumps   Such a play style is the equivalent of a button masher in the fighting game genre. Your use of all these terms and units tells me you have no idea what high level play really is. You and the so-called ""high level players"" you talk about, are merely slightly above average at best.  My entire deck is built upon the appreciation for quality over quantity, and a very surgical play style.   ""does anyone have sead up?"" resulted in too many ""No"" responses to keep up pressure   Yes it's very common for your average player to rely almost entirely on bombers and planes when making an offensive, and I would definitely suspect ""not having enough SEAD"" to be a problem to crop in such a play style.  The only true downside of the Raven is that you can't let it die (else you would be left with no SEAD at all), and that is a problem that can be solved with good micro 9 times out of 10.   Actually there are tons of places on different maps where recon helos simply sit above forests and see mostly everything in the open.   Sorry a key part of my argument which I only vaguely implied when I made the exception for the stealthy German Tiger, was that I easily shoot down these recon helos EVERY time I see them used in such a manner. They're either close enough to be shot down by my Chaparral (meaning I make sure they are dead before they've seen anything important), or they are far enough away to not be spotting anything other than vehicles moving in the open.  Recon helicopters are not static observers of the front line, if they are sitting anywhere near close enough to see anything important then they will be spotted and dealt with immediately."
wargame,3cxgbs,Aeweisafemalesheep,5,Mon Jul 13 06:04:51 2015 UTC,"So having beaten or gone even with all the top clans, marshals, groups, trashed the cheesers, etc is average. Yeah, right.   If you actually played surgical you would understand the unit composition you just quoted.  About the recon helos, that's not true at all. For example on the middle of bloody ridge behind the center zone there are a tons of bush spots for a helo to sit and see tons of open area that ground cannot. They're no where near max AA range unless you're using one to maintain LOS or to add more punishment to a wipe, ergo suicide anyway. A recon helo up is always a need.      solely on air? what? Skirmishing, punishing over extension, constantly pushing. Pop a spearheader with teamwork and you get to push out.  And no, the downside of the raven is, like all the upper tier sead, a reload time that takes forever."
wargame,3cxgbs,Cole7rain,-1,Mon Jul 13 07:19:37 2015 UTC,"Having beaten or gone even with all the top clans, marshals, groups, trashed the cheesers, etc is average.   I simply have to take your word for statements like that, and I suppose the only way to find out would be for us to play against each other. I'm not super experienced in 1v1 but I've played enough ranked to have a solid understanding of all the 1v1 maps. I'd honestly be curious to play these ""top players"", as I have yet to encounter them. The only community I know of is the small group of in-house players on Reddit TS.  As far as the whole discussion about recon helicopters as forward observers, I can only repeat that in my personal experiences I always manage to shoot them down and if they have exceptional optics then they are a worthy target for the ATACMs."
wargame,3cxgbs,Aeweisafemalesheep,3,Mon Jul 13 08:31:36 2015 UTC,"We're beating chests about big conquest games, 1v1 has nothing to do with that. Ever seen Amber T flail around like a fish out of water in a big game? Guy would be playing his standard stuff that works there, in 1v1. I see waves of cheap shit like t62D that would just die to a a couple of K1.     I just can't wrap my head around the helo stuff because there are so many safe places which allows you to create over lapping recon with the helo and recce inf/veh forward. Peeps gotta be doing suicide or just don't know the map."
wargame,3cxgbs,Cole7rain,-1,Mon Jul 13 09:04:45 2015 UTC,"Well to be honest my tactics don't change much between 1v1 and larger conquests games, the only thing that really changes my strategy is the map.  I just think you're overestimating exactly how much these static exceptional optics helos are usually seeing when placed over a forest/building where they are not at risk of being spotted. The invisible LOS blocker over forests is quite a bit taller than the height of the trees themselves, so any forests/hedgerows between the recon helo and what you're trying to see can easily block your LoS. Remember we are specifically talking about using helos as static observers, so I hope you're not introducing what you're seeing when you're flying it around into the discussion.  Here is an example from Bloody Ridge: http://i.imgur.com/KTxvuvP.jpg?1  My argument is based on my experiences where I know the point investment is rarely even coming close to paying off for the enemy in intel. The 'Very Good' optics helos only see out to 3500m, meaning you're automatically in range of enemy recon & AA... thus there can't be any argument about using these as static observers.   The 'Exceptional' recon helicopters may occasionally be useful as static observers, but not nearly as often as you are arguing... and certainly not to the extent that they would be borderline mandatory on top of a longbow as you suggested."
wargame,3cxgbs,Aeweisafemalesheep,3,Mon Jul 13 09:56:36 2015 UTC,"I've used recon cobra in that area, upfront a bit to view things coming down the road out of mid city. Only way you can lose that cobra is if you lost mid from that position, you completely collapsed. Exceptional recce can be a bush line back and still see things pushing onto the right side high ground, which is the commonly pushed placed in organized games. And when placed around where your LB is placed they can see around upto the road on that right side on ground. Having that LOS is absolutely critical and to lose them there you have to have completely collapsed or you're taking a nap.    I've also tried using rangers and 10 point m113s but to really have good eyes on the whole, there always needs to be a recon helo in the air."
wargame,3cxgbs,Tanis_2589,2,Mon Jul 13 10:59:40 2015 UTC,"I think as Sheep has been saying, any player worth his salt can use recon help effectively to watch the battlespace; more so than ground recon because of LOS issues.  Long reaching IR AA is always an issue, but cheap exceptional air recce is nothing to scoff at.  While you say you shoot them down all the time, so does everyone else.  Hell, I've shot a lot of recon helicopters, but their presence on the battlefield is useful especially when guarding the Longbow.  You just want to see what is being fast moved into the front, and good hover spots are common on every map. While DAP is the issue in opening, the slow moving Chappy can be avoided quite easily."

wargame,3cxgbs,Tanis_2589,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:39:34 2015 UTC,"I think ""static"" is the wrong way to think about it because people think of it in the most literal sense. It should be semi-static. A recon helicopter is more prone to artillery than AA in most cases I've encountered. I'm not saying that I'm perfect since I've lost my fair share to 3325m IR AA; however, being the most mobile eyes in the sky is imperative in a lot of maps.  Ground recon doesn't always good positioning to see everything automatically early on or when the front lines are rapidly changing."
wargame,3cxgbs,Cole7rain,0,Mon Jul 13 13:57:09 2015 UTC,"Yes but his original argument is that the cheaper exceptional optics helos are still borderline mandatory even if you already have the Longbow in your deck.

A lot of people don't use the Longbow for recon primarily, but they'll screen with recon Cobra or non-hellfire Kiowa. You're not going to get the same intelligence from ground recon.

Why take PTZ 59 when you have 16 of the better model? Why get non-napalm Li Jian instead, when it's one of Red Dragons most fearsome units?  Personally I would take out alot of the subpar units so that I have a full, balanced air force ( you have no ASF, and have 3 bombers) also some 25 point tanks (exceptionally good in forest fighting).  Do you have alot of success with this online? Looks like it's fun to play with all that recon and spam  I love Red Dragon personally, here's my take on it, not that it's any better than yours:  http://i.imgur.com/j4TXcXR.png  The Middle tank and the first helicopter and kinda optional and can be taken out for other things depending on my mood"
wargame,3cxgbs,Paladin_G,2,Tue Jul 14 13:04:55 2015 UTC,"-I'm pretty liberal with my use of M1992 scouts. I usually have two where the action is and fling the rest in random directions and see what they end up spotting. I like having the extra accuracy for the ATGM but I could get along with just one card if I had to save points somewhere.   -I have the basic Li Jian because they can defend themselves against light autocannon vehicles in forests. I know I could use them alongside Yuckjeondae but things don't always go according to plan. I've never had a problem killing other Infantry with them, their SMGs and LMG do a good-enough job. I also think that the Zhanshi are decent for plopping down in a town and I like having their autocannons so I'm reluctant to trade them out for LiJian'90.   -I don't have an ASF fighter because frankly I don't think the Red Dragons have a good enough one to spend a slot on it. I have plenty of ADA so I rely on them to shoot down anything threatening. More often than not I have a USSR/SovKor player on my team and the SU-27PU just murders everything.   -I have the PTZ-59 because I had a point left over. Looking at your deck I might change some of my Vehicle choices and spend the points elsewhere.   I do have good success with this deck online. Between Juckwidae tarpits and mass amounts of decent, low-cost firepower with my tank destroyers and infantry, I tend to hold and contest zones pretty well (I only play conquest, not destruction). Also massing bombers is fun, not much can survive 2 B-5s and a few J-7Hs in support.   The 25-point tanks are good for forest fighting? I never use cheap tanks, I'd  be really interested to know how you use them.   I do like your deck though. I'll copy it and see how it works over a few matches."
wargame,3cxgbs,thegoldelite,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:54:21 2015 UTC,"Can't argue with those reasons, I can see how playing conquest over destruction makes a big difference here.  I'd use the tanks for those fights where the range is gonna be short ranged and bloody, a 4 stack only costs 100 points. When you are up close, AP and accuracy and armour are non-issues, all you need is numbers. They make good fire support for forests or short hops across the open, you can smoke an enemy tank position and rush these in up close as well."
wargame,3cxgbs,Aeweisafemalesheep,2,Thu Jul 16 15:49:37 2015 UTC,point of the reservists is to spam them so i wouldn't cut their quantity. trade the supply helo for inf cmnd trade redundant units for the cheapo air to air mig so you can kill longbows in a single pass.

wargame,3cxgbs,steveraptor,2,Sun Jul 12 05:32:21 2015 UTC,"I was looking at ur USSR deck while at work, opened it again now at home and see u made some changes. Assuming this is intended for 1v1 up to 2v2/3v3; Anyway here goes:  LOG:UAZ is acceptable in 1v1 but is going to die to random mortar/arty/fart everytime, for 2v2 + replace it either with a cmd tank or a BRDM. Again, MI-6 is not needed for small 1v1/2v2 maps, trucks are enough.  SUPP: no point to use the ""stock"" BUK when u have the BUK-M1 or TOR. Put Tunguska M in ur 5th slot for high-end IR AA, and if u micro it well, a very very brutal radar AA gun.  INFANTRY: VDV 90 are your bread and butter infantry, they need to be cheap enough to field. put them in BTR-D, which is an amazing 5 pt transport, 4 of them can decimate infantry in mere seconds, and downvett them. IGLA-N should get to the front lines ASAP, i suggest putting them in BTR-70. For the 5th slot u can go depends on ur playstyle: Your current motos are good to garrison towns and be a fodder, thats it. If u want to use them in forest fights and actually be usefull, get the 90 version, much better RPGs, in addition you should consider the unique transports available to them: BMP-1D, BMP-3. Another option, which i personally prefer, is replacing motos with flamethrowers (10 man infantry) in BTR-T. This small force by itself is a VERY strong anti infantry team, pair them up with VDV 90 and u got a small, cheap and very deadly force.  TANKS: for a cheap workhorse, the T-72A is fine, but i prefer the T-80, much better in every category. Accuracy doesn't matter since u engage with them at medium ranges. T-72b is a medium tank which is overrated for no reason, i personally got bad experience with this tank, and the final straw was when a pair of my T-72b lost to Swedish pair of STRV105 which costs 55 points each. I replaced it with the underrated T-64BM, which is a more reliable platform, u trade some range and a slighter worse ATGM, for more armor, and rate of fire, accuracy and -5pt cost, which is more important and a much better trade. i started using T-64BM last month and they provide me with a much better results then the T-72B ever did. You don't pick tanks according to their ATGM quality, this is just a secondary bonus. The BMP-685 is a good unit but it gets outclassed and outperformed in every category by the Zhalo, which also doesn't take an armor slot, it is usually picked in USSR airborne decks. Instead you lack a heavy tank in between the T-72BU and ur medium tank. Tanks to consider for the role: T-80U, T-64BV1/BV.  RECON: T-55 is meh, can't be used offensively cuz he cant hit anything beyond 500m range and dies to any cheap AT. BRDM-3, is a much better unit and at the same price. Carry an excellent auto cannon, 150KMP/H and can be paired with zhalos as a mobile punch force.  VEH: as sad as it is, the current stat of dedicated ATGM platforms is total trash (except the Chinese one). They are easy to detect and killed, expensive and very easy to abuse them when they fire. they also take 2 hit-rolls on their missiles. hard to make them cost efficient. Its better to use the USSR build-in ATGMs on their MBTs. SU-122 is great, but i prefer the Zhalo, gives u a a lot more options to play with (opening, flanking, sitting in forest and sniping stuff).  HELO: good choices here.  PLANES: YAK-38 bombers are trash, and has no impact except on ur own economy. in general, any bomber with 2x 500kg bomb/napalm is trash and will have minimal impact. Instead put the SU-24M, a MUCH better choice at wiping ground forces. MIG-27 is good choice, just make sure u upvet them, 2 of them will get the job done. SU-25T is redundant, especially in 1v1, the time when u will actually field to kill multiple high value armor targets without any AA escort of fighters is when the game is 10v10 and is already over. besides, you have MIG-27 for this job.  YAK-141 are kinda lackluster middle ground ASFs, they have good survivabilty but only two long range missiles, and 2 short range ones, which for a 140 price tag, imo, is unacceptable. The elite MIG-25PD outshine them in cost effectiveness and in general a very reliable ASF."

For all other jobs medium tanks (like M1Wilk, K1, IP Abrahms, T72-B1) are preferred.

wargame,3cxgbs,Paladin_G,2,Fri Jul 17 14:36:18 2015 UTC,"I'll give my opinion on the American deck   Log: I'd consider a different command unit than the Jeep. Something with a little armor, or even a tank. Jeeps are too fragile unless it's all you have, and you won't really need 10 command units.   Infantry: Nix the Assault Engineers. You could take more Marines in their place, or Light Riflemen in Humvees for area denial.   Support: I'd try to make an Avenger fit in there somehow but those are good choices.   Tank: Nix the 65 point Abrams. It doesn't do anything your other tanks can't do and is eating up a precious 3 activation points.   Recon:  Not too shabby. I'd probably downvet the Bradley's (IIRC you can get more than 4 per card, right?). Consider getting Rangers in trucks.  Vehicle: Comvat's a no-brainer.   Heli: I'd probably get rid of the OH-58, use the saved points elsewhere.   Air: Replace the Prowler with the F-4G Wild Weasel. Has 4 good SEAD missiles plus Sidewinders so it can be used agaisnt choppers in a pinch.  Get an F-18 in there, the one with the 4x F&F Mavericks  F-15D's a good choice.

INF - Looks good, but might want to swap the 20pt Panzergrenadiere for Fallschirmjäger 90 in a Fuch. Fallschirmjäger 90 are one of the best elite commando infantry units available to blufor. Give them a try and see what you think.  SUP - The 30pts W.German mortar has too little autonomy for my liking so I would recommend you switch it for the 40pt version.

The Keiler is a great tank as it has an autoloader for its main gun meaning that reload times won't be affected by panic under fire. The Keiler is also one of the few tanks on blufor that can fire its main gun and autocannon at the same time. Making it a great fire support unit. Swap Leopard 1A5 or AMX-40 for Keiler. I also think you might have too many tanks, especially tanks that overlap in price and ability. See if you can get down to 4 cards of tanks.   RECON - No 2 man sniper recon? It is one of the best recon units available. Keep them in cover and turn off their weapons. You will be surprised how close to the enemy you can get them if you can keep them in a bush. If you dropped the Command Jeeps you should have enough points for the 2 man sniper team in a fuch.  VEH - Looks good.  HEL - OK.  PLANE - Upvet Mirage 2000 RDI to elite. It seems kind of silly to bring a SEAD airplane for just 2 ground attack airplanes. Try to see if you can get away with using 3 or 4 cards of tanks, so you can add a HE bomber like the Tornado IDS or Etendard."

I also use Delta Force for additionnal combat firepower in CC. Light Inf 90 in plain Humvees are also good, because cheap, fast and limited ATGM SUP - your AA network is too much radar based (thus requires time consuming micro). You NEED 1 card of Avengers, yes they are THAT good. Usually I prefer Patriot + Avengers: as these guys don't need to be micro'ed, you can forget them. I'll also ditch the ATACMS, but I'm not an arty player. If you often use it, keep it, otherwise remove it for cheap M109s TNK - maybe M1 card isn't needed? I run only 3 cards of tanks (M1IP, M1A1(HA) and M1A2) and rarely field them all, even in very high income games REC - I'll take another Navy SEALS card in V150, these guys are very good anti-inf. I suppose you place some helo Navy SEALS on flanks at start of the game? HEL - iirc OH-58C/S is the AA one? So you have 3 cards of AA helos. I'd remove OH-58C/S and replace it with AH-64 as my tank buster of choice if I face heavy tanks AIR - if F-4S Phantom II is your ASF replace it with F-15C. F-4 Wild Weasel is better choice as SEAD"

Put SAS in AH.7 lynx helicopter for fast helo opening with your  recon sbs, the rocket pods are invaluable for support. Can try Fusiliers 90 in Warrior Milan's instead of a dedicated Milan atgm team. Support - drop adats for stormer. Tank - down vet Challenger 2, change challenger 1 Mk2 for 1 Mk3. Recon - need a card of cheap recon, maybe another recce in a truck or green jackets.

wargame,3cxgbs,Eurasian-HK,2,Thu Jul 16 10:13:03 2015 UTC,Looking more into commonwealth recon options you might do well to add the Canadian Pathfinders in a cheap truck for your 5th recon card.

wargame,3cxgbs,Paladin_G,3,Wed Jul 15 23:57:35 2015 UTC,"Kind of a mess IMO.   Logistics: Ditch the supply chopper, consider a second command.   Infantry: Use SAS as your manpads, Javelins really aren't that good. Replace Javelins with Canadian Airborne, not the 90s version because that C2A1 LMG is statistically one of the better ones. Replace your Canadian Airborne '90 with Ghurkas '90, one of the best 15 man infantry units in the game. I'd also consider replacing the Pioneers with Fusilier '90 in Warrior Milans, a bit pricey but both the Fusiliers and Warrior Milan punch above their weight.   Diggers in M113s are also cheap, relatively effective spam infantry for pushing a town or forest.  Support: Replace Cent Marksman with Chally Marksman. Can fire on the move and survive a SEAD hit.  Replace your mortars with 120mm mortars or the British AS 90 Howitzer.  Consider the Stormer HVM in the support tab too.   Tank: You don't need two cards of Leopard AS1. Replace one of them with Challenger 1 Mk3s.   Recon: Replace the Green Jackets and Fox. Take the British recon helo with exceptional optics and consider the Canadian recon LAV or a Rover Pinke with exceptional optics. Put the Recce in the helicopter. I like to use one or two Recce to watch the front line while the other two take a chopper deep behind enemy lines and spot vulnerable things or incoming reinforcements.  Vehicle: Chimera and Warrior are useless, trust me. Consider a Centurion AVRE for infantry support.   Helicopter: Lynx 3 is just too expensive for what it does. Get a cheaper ATGM-only chopper for emergencies if you absolutely need it, otherwise accept that Commonwealth Choppers are rubbish.   Plane: Solid choices. Consider sacrificing one Eurofighter Typhoon for the ANZAC F-111C bomber. You don't really gain much for going Commonwealth over pure UK and the F-111C is one of the best things ANZAC has on offer."

wargame,3cxgbs,SovietPootis,2,Thu Jul 16 08:29:00 2015 UTC,"Dunno about celtics, they have only 4hp so that engagement should be in my favour. Daps or even Haps could be a nuisance, though.  However, my openers aren't very heli-heavy. KA-52 and a MI-24V or maybe even two, and the maybe like a pair of GRU's, mostly for harassing right off the bat. Maybe a gorno for holding an important point. After that tons of BTR 90's and other wheeled vehicles as a main force. Then some cheap stuff as a holding force somewhere.  EDIT: considering how Norad/US are relatively unpopular factions in ranked, I am not too concerned about the Dap's. Hap's in the other hand aren't that much more superior over MI-24v. And TY-90's are rare, that I can tell you."

wargame,3cxgbs,Destruct1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:39:09 2015 UTC,We all know the ranking is China (TY) > USA (DAP) > Others  Since china/usa has such a huge advantage it is pointless trying to improve against a enemy with such a big advantage.  If the other factions stumble into a air duel usually neither side has sufficient firepower. They get 4 missiles for ~100 pts and every target needs 2 hits. Since you have to shoot the enemy AA helis first and some of your AA helis die before firing all missiles and some missiles miss the transport helis of both sides are mostly unharmed.  P.S I often win 1vs1 because my 2 TY kill half the enemy troops in an air battle. Air dropping against an unknown without USA/China seems risky.

wargame,3cxgbs,Itcausesproblems,2,Sun Jul 12 22:09:58 2015 UTC,"USSR Mech:   Immediate thoughts:    Drop the strela and use the Igla - N infantry in its place. They have the same effectiveness and when running Mech will save you 2 deck points & 25pts/unit. For infantry AA then use just the regular Igla. Swap 1 card of Tor for a Buk, yes Buk has less range to counter heli's but that's why you have the tunguskas and then you can engage fighter/bomber 700 yds earlier (aka before they drop their payload). FYI turn you RAD guns off on the tunguska. It's dedicated purpose is Heli-suppression which is handled just fine by it's missiles (unless your facing a massive rush). Drop a card of the MOTO/BMP-3 for a MOTO BMP-1D, grenade launchers are excellent at suppression and once infantry are suppressed their fodder. OR you can swap them more spetz in MT-LV's. This Swap one of your Spamostreleki cards for a heavy shock infantry whichever is available and ideally with an CQC tag. NONA's. I'm guessing you have these for the range. I'd recommend the vasilek. It's first salvo will be landing when the NONA's are just leaving the barrel. It also reloads the fastest of any mortar. you need a solid 50-70pt tank, ideally something with a atgm.   I might have more for you later when I have more time to go through it."

wargame,3cxgbs,Paladin_G,2,Mon Jul 13 04:50:00 2015 UTC,Care to elaborate? I'd be most interested to hear your opinion on the French deck.
wargame,3cxgbs,SovietPootis,3,Mon Jul 13 16:39:04 2015 UTC,"Just like Aeweisafemalesheep, these decks are simply not competitive.   Let's start with the USSR. It is a faction that is based on versatility. You have an access to great tanks, infantry, recon units, planes, choppers.. you name it. It is generally the best to keep it general or on a special occasions airborne on team games if you know your shit.  With the moto deck you lose an access to solid tanks, and your infantry is being carried by expensive transports. You need spammable shit, period. Also, Motostrelki are quite bad tbh. Sure, '90s rocket launcher has 24AP but I'd rather have the VDV's from the general decks and have the moto '90s in cheap 5pt transports (or not have them at all). Also, you lose some of the great AA units that the general decks have.  Consider playing Red Dragons if you want to play motorized. You get access to good wheeled transports like the 10pt BTR-60P and WZ-551 with an autocannon. It plays in the strengths of the faction as you do not lose too much on the AA tab and you get access to a great recon tank and a solid tank destroyer on the vehicle tab with 21AP. It is not a noob-friendly coalition as you need to know your limits when playing it, but you could look at Firestarter's gameplay to see how it's played.  Then there's mechanized. Now, the problem with mech is that it's a slow deck. You lose wheeled transports and many good helis. Also, your recon tab is horseshit. Also, NO VDV. You have to rely on your shitty motostrelki which definitely stink. They are suppose to take punishment, not dish it out.  Many of the same things apply to Commonwealth mech deck. Also, that coalition is generally speaking bad. Same thing applies to France alone. They do have some nice units but should be played with Eurocorps, as West Germany is the bread-and-butter in many aspects."

wargame,3cxgbs,thegoldelite,2,Mon Jul 13 10:20:48 2015 UTC,"I'll just point out the key things I see:  You should always bring 5 cards of infantry, it's the most cost effective thing you have in the game.  5 cards of tanks is excessive, Drop the 2A4. Often the tanks  between 110-150 points just don't cut the mustard, they are too expensive to be fielded in numbers, but not effective enough to justify bringing just one along.  You have too much spam crap (kanonjags), and only 3 cards of planes.  That said it's a very good deck considering you have played only a week.  Finer points:  Keiler is a great medium cost tank, comes with an autocannon to punish infantry and anything lightly armoured, really helps them pack a punch and stand out from other tanks.  I'd bring Jagers in 5 point transports and bring something else in wheeled transports like RIMA, but that's just preferrence"
wargame,3cxgbs,CisseV,2,Mon Jul 13 11:49:44 2015 UTC,"i've updated it to this  I've removed my logi heli, because i haven't actually used it. replaced the 2a4 with the keiler. took another infantry, there's no 5 point jager transport available though? removed a kanon and the wiesel tow (they ran out of fuel whenever i tried to use them anyway) updated jets"
wargame,3cxgbs,Paladin_G,2,Mon Jul 13 12:24:15 2015 UTC,"My $.02, I'm an above-average player at best so take my advice with a grain of salt.   Logi: Unless you're playing Conquest you don't need that much command. If you are playing conquest, you're fine. Otherwise I'd swap it out for that 30-point French supply chopper, you'd be surprised how often having a quick-moving resupply can be useful.   Infantry: Put the Jagers in the 5 point M113. Half the strength of the Jagers is their incredibly cheap cost at just 15 points for a decent LAW and MG3. Cheaper the better.  I'd strongly consider replacing the Rima with another unit of Panzergrenadiers in a lower-cost Marder 1. I like the Rima a lot, but the Panzerfaust 3 is an arguably better rocket (more AP and accuracy for half ROF) and the LMG3 is the best machinegun in the game. Also Marder 1s are more effective autocannon platforms than the VABT20/13.  Take the Milan F3 at the highest veterancy. You don't need them often, but when you do, the accuracy helps. Put them in a cheaper truck, like a VAB. You rarely need to fly an ATGM into a lonely position.   Support: Your Caesars are more than capable enough on their own to make the VPM 120s redundant. I'd take another Crotale, a Roland 3 (the French one is marginally better for the same price) or those 35 point Mistral trucks.   Tanks: All solid choices.  You could make an argument for taking Leopard 1A5s instead of the stock Leopard 2, but they're all good.   Recon: Again, good choices. No real point in putting the German sniper team in a Fuchs Milan, though. The Milan probably won't hit anything and will give your snipers' position away if it shoots while in their vicinity. Put them in a truck or preferably a chopper for easier snooping behind enemy lines.  Helo: Some people will tell you the Tigers are too expensive for what they do, but I like them. They have higher strength and their good stealth makes them a little harder to see until it's too late (for your enemy). Try them out and switch the Gazelle Celtics to replace the HAP if you find they aren't working for you.   Air: Replace the Mirage 2000RCI with something else. The Mirage 5F is a decent anti-infantry bomber, and the Super Etendard with the 30AP missile is a reliable heavy tank killer. Your Rafale is a good enough ASF to not warrant another air superiority."
wargame,3cxgbs,Ka1ser,2,Tue Jul 14 00:43:04 2015 UTC,"Looks alright, but I think there are still one or two points that could be improved.  Inf: when I started playing I also ordered the the Fallschirmjäger 90 in that heli, but that thing is garbade. The TrTrsp is huge, therefore it is not only easier for the enemy to spot it, but also to hit it with AA. I'd order them in a normal Fuchs (without the MILAN). The Jäger should be able to come in a 5-point M113. Take another look, sometimes the transports are not ordered by price for some reason.   Support: depending on how you play, on which maps and with how many other people you might need another AA unit. If you have trouble playing against an enemy that uses a lot of aircrafts take a Roland 3 (you could also put a Mistral team in instead of the RiMa, but those mostly are less effective)  Tanks: good choices. Take another look on how many tanks you actually use in a normal match and if you find out that if you really need 5 different tanks and if you actually use the expensive Leo 2A5. Also take a look at the Leo 1A5 --> great cannon for good price.   Recon: Fernspäher, Tiger and VBL are great. Not too sure about the AMX. Maybe also take a look at the VAB (exceptional optics), the BGS in trucks (very cheap), the Alouette and the Scout Leo (to accompany tank attacks). In the end it's mostly a preference choice and you have to find what suits your playstyle the best.   Vehicle: Kanonenjagdpanzer is okay. I prefer the 25 points one, but both are okay.   Helo: I use the same. Some people will tell you that the Cassiopeia or the Gazelle are better because cheaper, but I like the Tigres.   Planes: I hate the Peace Rhine. I think the Super Nintendo Entendard is better suited for tank hunting."

One piece of AA can shoot the helis down, and good AA network can easily deny you from reinforcing your troops efficiently. Also, you can't escort your infantry with AA helis, meaning that you can't do an opener with them.  Your AA sucks. RBS-90 is alright but 40-point hawks are trash. Your tanks are abysmal as well. You won't kill anything with em. And your plane tab is quite shoddy as well.  Just delete the whole deck. It's not good at all. Marine decks just generally speaking are that way.   If you want to play marines however, then US is the best blufor choice by far. They have almost everything that you need, including heavy tanks. But it's rather bad alone so play it in a team game with a naval corridor. *Mixed blufor works too.  On the redfor side you could go with either USSR or mixed.

If you want to deploy several units at once, hold shift while clicking the deployment icon to make battlegroups (ideally 2-3 units). Then, hold shift when positioning the reinforcement on the terrain to deploy several groups.  While not recommended, you can hold Ctrl when selecting a reinforcment to directly deploy a 4-units group.  The different hotkeys can be accessed in the game options."

wargame,3cw4n3,UrbanCosmonaut,11,Mon Jul 13 21:18:34 2015 UTC,Stacked teams are simply toxic to the community and provides even more evidence for a matchmaking system. And for those defending teams at the end of the day it is you playing with a load of your friends against a bunch of hopeless randoms which will get beaten 90% of the time.

wargame,3cw4n3,frankwouter,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:13:58 2015 UTC,The game should tell people to be carefull when joining lobbies and to check the stats of other players. It is all just pure lack of knowledge.

Fighting more or less equal enemies has been pretty fun so far.  But yea I did not care about stats much at start and made sucky decks, so my stats are just now starting to slowly grow.

Inhouse games are played, but some people like them, so don't, so it is not always an option (keep in mind that the teamspeak has huge variance in player skill).

wargame,3cw4n3,frankwouter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:44:41 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree with you.  If you know your team is outmatched, you kinda know how the game is going to play out so you can prepare for it.  Its easier to prepare a defensive strategy than to prepare an agile force that can react to multiple situations (needed for balanced games).  If you are new to the game, defending against an experienced player can be an educational experience.  Watch the replay and see how their attacked worked and where you were able to stop it.  You can learn a lot about defensive and offensive strategy this way.  IMO, its better to play against a team of experienced players as a newbie than play a newbie v newbie game that turns into a static arty fest.  You don't learn anything playing against shitty players."

Not to mention you can't kill the blufor cv with anything but helos, planes, arty, and watercraft, whereas the redfor one can be found and killed by any land or air unit. Blufor also has no place to park artillery without risking it. Redfor will be able to push land units further toward the middle than blufor, because they can fast move. If redfor pushes blufor back to the water, all of redfor's land forces become useless and redfor has to reinvest in watercraft, helos, and planes.  Overall redfor has more natural map control but blufor has a spawn that is harder to neutralize. Might be fair for destruction, but not fair for conquest."

Not to mention you can't kill the blufor cv with anything but helos, planes, arty, and watercraft, whereas the redfor one can be found and killed by any land or air unit.   I don't see this as a problem. The asymmetry is intentional...   Blufor also has no place to park artillery without risking it.   You're doing artillery wrong if you're parking it. FOB's might be an issue but 1610's/MUNAs make up for it. And howitzers/MLRS are available in NAV tab.   Redfor will be able to push land units further toward the middle than blufor, because they can fast move.   Right, it's intentionally asymmetric. That's why ships are needed in the beginning, to counter helicopter rushes to the water. And why there's spawns along the edge of the map   If redfor pushes blufor back to the water, all of redfor's land forces become useless and redfor has to reinvest in watercraft, helos, and planes.

wargame,3cu41j,Saltysalad,3,Sat Jul 11 00:18:05 2015 UTC,People will walk into these death traps more often now. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? I dunno.
wargame,3cu41j,frankwouter,-5,Sat Jul 11 03:06:04 2015 UTC,"But how will we spot them if we can't see stats?   The best solution is 4v4 singleplayer unranked matchmaking (just puts people of simular skill together and creates a stacking free place).   Hiding the issue won't fix it.   (and death stacks are in some way caused by steam people. Good players band together because they can't get decent games with really new pubbies. This was less of an issue in ALB, where the pubs were nicer and less stuborn and the veterans didn't mind playing with them)."
wargame,3cu41j,nated0ge,3,Fri Jul 10 21:41:12 2015 UTC,"I dont think this game (or any game) needs unranked matchmaking, and certainly not fixed at 4v4 (for those with lower end PCs). If you start running ranked and unranked parallel to lobby games, it will really start to divide the already limited player base, which already is split into players groups that play the different modes in addition to ranked.  I do personally believe hiding stats helps. In COH1, before unranked players got stats, games were far less stacked as it was near the end when the game started tracking all stats."
wargame,3cu41j,frankwouter,2,Sat Jul 11 00:18:52 2015 UTC,"How could they be less stacked? Stacked people are almost always people playing together that already know eachother and usually have the advantage of good communications. Must have been fun running blindly into teamstacks every other game with a FNG by your side.   I would also think that people play more together as the game gets older. You build up a network and join certain clans and you learn that there is a world where you are not the only one actually doing something good in the game.   Wargame is already beyond the point where good players dare to play with pubs and hiding stats will only enforce it.   I would prefer a system where games played and unit distribution are kept visible, since these stats are pretty reliable and are not damaged by a bad start. It would also spot teamstacks by having a similar number of games.   But unranked matchmaking would be the best way for new players to get decent matches vs somewhat equally new players witouth being roflestomped and without ruining the game of 7 other people having a close games (it happens way to often in 4v4, having a game end in 20 min because someone goes full retard).   Do you really think hiding stacks will fix the current teams vs pubs issues in WARGAME ATM?"
wargame,3cu41j,nated0ge,2,Sat Jul 11 00:34:05 2015 UTC,"I actually should have been more clear; by hiding stats I mean totally removing them.  I agreed to you before that stacks do tend to be friends, I myself play with people who Ive known for almost a decade. But  yes, I do think removing stats will fix it because the incentive to ""keep up"" good stats would decrease. Ive seen the opposite happen in COH1 where previously no stats for unranked games were available, and as soon as they updated it to track unranked stats, people started to care/worry about it.  In Europe in Ruins (a COH Mod I played for years), we had this exact same problem. In all honesty, it never got fixed. The closest we came to ""fixing"" the problem came was when the names and stats of your opponents were blanked out, so you didnt see what you were up against. This ended up causing stack vs stacks, which was actually more playable but far more time consuming.   If you ask me, I honestly believe REMVOING stats entirely will make pub games far more playable.   As to your comment on leavers on 4v4, thats precisly the reason I dislike large games. In my limited gaming experience, there are two main reasons to play large games: - For casual fun because bigger games means you have more leeway in what you do. - Bigger games can make lower skill players feel more comfortable.  I do honestly believe the 2nd one is a geninue factor to why you see it so often, I saw it in COH1, World in Conflict, and currently in 4v4 COH2.   If you're going to force players to play unranked MM, it should really be 1v1, 2v2, so it acts as a training ground for ranked 1v1/2v2. For anything bigger than 3v3, I believe it should remain as it is in a lobby."

And it is funny how often ppl with more than 500 or even 1k games join games like ""max lvl 10"" etc. So i think we can look at your point from both sides. As an experienced player it should not be your goal to just pubstomp, but some experienced players try to get into exactly this position. Watching stats is shit but it prevents us all from playing games we most likely would not enjoy"
wargame,3cu41j,Amoss_se,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:25:19 2015 UTC,This. A better solution would be to make level ranges part of the game setup so that people who did not fit the criteria could not join the game.

So our and my winrates are rather low(sub 45%). So everytime I play a game solo and join one of these death-stacked games on the opposing side...  Let's just say the salt mines are missing a few workers. Delicious.  Honnestly most of the death-stacks use cheeze strats to break the morale of those obviously fairly new players. But if you actually sort of know the game. And survive the cheeze, the death stacks usually panic."

Burratino/napalm any town/road you are heading to, again at the start. Might not be all that effective, but still. Annoying as hell. Full on rushes from start(chopper rushes are fine, they serve a purpose). Usually spam cheap cost effective units like super cheap tanks, AA, infantry etc.. Air spam(this one im guilty of myself. Skyhawks OP). Call in 2-4 bombers at the start to level any push you thought you had. Sure one guy on your team might have a dedicated anti-air jet. But he cant kill 4 of those suckers"

wargame,3cu41j,LePoisson,4,Tue Jul 14 17:24:06 2015 UTC,My 2 cents on this is really simple.    Go back and play a match in ALB and see how quick it is to get a game.   Then play Red Dragon and be greeting by lobby simulator 2015.   Stats after games or outside of a lobby are cool and ALB has a nice way of getting a general idea of teams capabilities.  But stats in the lobby make people afraid to play the game.    At the end of the day none of us are putting it on our resume.
wargame,3cu41j,frankwouter,2,Sat Jul 11 01:24:24 2015 UTC,The match quality in RD is much higher though. I prefer a balanced game with a 15 min wait versus a bad unbalanced games all the time.  ALB had the advantage of having a community that was way better the RD community and there were much less clueless new guys (and the ones that were actually took some good advice instead sticking there head in the ground and keep spamming arty).
wargame,3cu41j,LePoisson,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:43:14 2015 UTC,I seriously think that boils down to the stats visibility
wargame,3cu41j,frankwouter,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:45:01 2015 UTC,"I played both games a lot and stat visibility has only made pubbing much better. Pubbed my first 200 games in RD and by being picky using the stats, I would always have fair games. In Alb this wasn't possible and it was just a massive gamble that possibility wasted 30 min of time because your teammate doesn't know which part of the tank to point forward."
wargame,3cu41j,Tangjuicebox,3,Sat Jul 11 11:48:38 2015 UTC,I agree totally. I had to lose a bunch of games on purpose so my win was not as high and I could get games.
wargame,3cu41j,saucey_cow,3,Fri Jul 10 20:38:54 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely hate that. As a new player, the last thing I want is to get steamrolled by some level 30 (And trust me, it has happened, many times) and the game ends in less than 10 minutes. I learn nothing at all other than ""git gud feggit"".  I learn much much more if I'm playing with someone who is at my skill level or even a little bit above it, but in no way do I ever want to play with some level 30+ only to get absolutely destroyed."
wargame,3cu41j,nated0ge,2,Sat Jul 11 08:43:58 2015 UTC,"You could remove the precise stats and still keep the levels , that would alleviate the problem somewhat."
wargame,3cu41j,PrinceDeTolly,2,Sun Jul 12 05:40:53 2015 UTC,"If it hasn't happened so far, I doubt it will be implemented now, and for good reason. Shown ranks is the only way you can get a remotely balanced game on your skill level. Sure there are dicks that kick for high win rate, but for noobs who want to start out easy there's no way to get a noob game without profile checking. On the opposite end of the spectrum, experienced players benefit a lot from being able to kick noobs to have better games.  I just remember the horrors of ALB when you'd get a teammate who seemingly just downloaded the game an hour ago and ruins your match, or the ubiquitous full NATO teams that you can't be sure are just normal players or a 90% winrate pubstomp squadron tryharding. My match quality has gone up A LOT since RD released and I think people have rose tinted glasses about the effects hidden stats have in Wargame."
wargame,3cu41j,warbnerd,2,Sat Jul 11 01:08:09 2015 UTC,"Best would be ELO system like chess; should be easy to number-crunch; host/admin can set elo range; for non-dedi should be +-250 of host by default. Just forcing auto matchmaking is wrong in any case, this isn't CoD.  For teams, whole team should have its own ELO score where they have played together already; otherwise heuristic on individual player ELO + ""similar player combo"" teams ELO. There's algos for doing this cheaply these days, similar to simhashing/buckethasing as done for Amazon recommends.  For original question - make scores more transparent if anything. Maybe K/D like latency meter in quintile marks, or deciles?  +- a team fairness meter, see ""heuristic"" above."
wargame,3cu41j,superscout,2,Sat Jul 11 22:43:39 2015 UTC,There should just be a matchmaking system. I don't know why people are still arguing over this. It simultaneously stops people kicking people who are better than them and also makes sure you don't end up playing people who are way more experienced
wargame,3cu41j,TheloniousCrunk,3,Sun Jul 12 05:26:04 2015 UTC,"Yes it would be. There are a lot of seemingly obvious changes that would make this game a lot less difficult to get in to.

On the other hand a willing host can balance the game fairly well by just looking at the stats. Unfortunately most host are part of a stack or want to stomp.
wargame,3cu41j,frankwouter,2,Sat Jul 11 10:06:17 2015 UTC,Host your own game. A better world starts with yourself and stackers will always stack (because they like to play with their friends).

wargame,3cu41j,LittleTinGod,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:10:42 2015 UTC,"all you have to do is look back to ALB, game wait times were extremely short, and games as a whole were much more balanced.

wargame,3cu41j,frankwouter,-3,Sat Jul 11 01:03:15 2015 UTC,"No, people would just get frustrated after getting pubstomped all day and playing with total beginners who only buy arty. people just need to be more carefull with the games they join.    Still I feel that new players are very much discouraged from sticking to the game, because they will never have any moments of success unless they adapt to the rhythm of only joining stacked teams.   This is why its good to have stats visible.    My suggestion for a future title would be to prevent people from checking other people's profiles before the match ends. Ideally, there would also be some sort of ELO system, where it punishes you for joining stacked teams, and rewards players who beat the deathstacks.   Eugen can't make such a system."

New players haven't yet caught on tha they have to check the entire enemy team to figure out that they are all 80+% win-team-joiners. Instead of experienced players helping them understand why it might not be a good idea to arty spam, they end up doing just that because they will get crushed anyway.

Instead of experienced players helping them understand why it might not be a good idea to arty spam, they end up doing just that because they will get crushed anyway.   This can be fixed by informing people about it using a popup or a decent tutorial. I used to play public and I never really had issues with that. People knew about this stuff in ALB and there were no issues (I started in alb). The current system is a bandage to fix the lack of matchmaking.    Because?   It is too late into the game to change all the matchmaking around. You also can't force people to use matchmaking, so it will split up the small community.   They may pull it off, but i'm really skeptical."
wargame,3cu41j,JustARandomGerman,2,Fri Jul 10 21:48:58 2015 UTC,"Well, they could just allow servers to auto-balance. That way there is a place to go for people who want a balanced game, and a place to go to play with 9 of their TS-friends."
wargame,3cu41j,NocTempre,2,Fri Jul 10 21:55:53 2015 UTC,"There already is (again, jut inform people). The Eugen servers are not stacked and a great place for public games.Your idea already exists, people just don't know about it. You even auto balance balance yourself by hosting your own game.   The big question is also: how do you autobalance? Games played is sort of right, but still has huge variance.   TL;DR Just inform people about how to find good games and the issue is fixed. I would suggest a pop up message when you first click on multiplayer and an entry in the game guide. If can't find good games, they also can't find autobalanced servers.  My 2 cents."
wargame,3cu41j,Kappa043,2,Fri Jul 10 22:04:54 2015 UTC,"I hate auto-balance systems in every game I play. Makes it impossible to join friends.

Similar things can happen to a good USSR/NSWP Moto or something too - although BMPs are a tad less squishy than VABs - versus mass MARS too. It blows no matter which side you're on.

wargame,3cu3k6,Cole7rain,25,Sat Jul 11 19:56:17 2015 UTC,"From a thread I made on the Wargame forums:  Examples of changes which I think would increase player retention:  (some of these are very simple, and some are already planned)   Get rid of the ability to view stats in the lobby. I used to play a lot of in-house games on the Reddit TS, but these days there is rarely enough people on to get one going so we end up in a 3v3/4v4 public lobby. When there is at least 4 people I try to convince everyone to play 2v2 against each other, but they won't have it (to be fair it's partly to do with the fact that 2v2 just isn't as fun as 3v3/4v4). I roll my eyes every time the host kicks players with high percentages (70-90%). I used to call people out for this, but it's hard enough to find people to play with these days so I can't be bothered. Create new maps, preferably without naval. I know that hurts to hear, but I simply feel naval only serves to create an entirely separate battle during a match, and thus detracts from the core experience. If naval was designed in such a way so that one team had to assault a coastline while the other defended it, that would make a lot more sense to me. Improve the Armory, less hidden stats. (1) Make the accuracy advantages of veterancy more clear (show adjusted accuracy on the unit card). (2) The ""Cycle time"" of MGs found in the hidden knowledge spreadsheet appears to be a huge factor in determine the DPS of an MG, I believe it should be listed on the unit card or the rate of fire should be adjusted to better reflect the resulting ""True RPM"" that's also found in the spreadsheet. (3) The time to aim, shot interval, and shots per salvo for artillery/mortars definitely needs to be placed on the unit card. The rate of fire listed in the armory is virtually meaningless without that context. This is a big one, but if at all possible consider introducing 3v3/4v4 matchmaking. Let's face it, Wargame is just more fun when played in larger 3v3/4v4 games compared to smaller 1v1/2v2 games. I know lots of people roll their eyes and say ""yuck matchmaking get out of here e-sports nerd"", but the truth is these are the exact same people who LOVE to pick and choose their opponents. I also think if 3v3/4v4 matchmaking is introduced, matchmaking should be placed at the front and center of the multiplayer interface. Right now most players don't even know matchmaking exists, never mind the fact that it puts you into a lobby that looks much like a public lobby which I initially found very confusing. Matchmaking only works if the majority of the playerbase is using it, so that's why I'm saying it has to be placed front and center in the multiplayer UI."

Back in ALB the USMC had LAV-25s for transports and they were one of the two units (the other was the VAB-20mm) in the entire game that were wheeled autocannons (the 14.5 cannon doesn't count that's basically an LMG), now the problem occurred when the USMC were already good and had basically the best transports for anti-infantry (again LVTP-7A1) and basically the VAB 20mm was trash compared to it, there was also no PACT counterpart.  Following major bitching and rioting from PACT and the fact they had no BTR-80A w/e, some used the IRL execuse and pointed out that the US used the LAV-25 as a recon unit back then (which was horse shit), and naturally euguen listened to the crybabys and the LAV-25 was tooken out of the US marines transport options...

Keep them both at elite so the us has an effective special forces and delta doesn't turn into crappy rangers.

EC, BD and Commonwealth are much worse off in the aa department especially the long range radar versions.   Redfor does still have its atgms and grenade launcher advantage and it has dedicated anti inf elites on each coalition. They also still have more heavy tanks, which is an advantage. (and people please use sead vs ottomatic, people also don't complain about tungusta guns which have similar dps).

wargame,3cu3k6,Kappa043,3,Sat Jul 11 16:45:41 2015 UTC,"Make US Light Infantry 80/90, Canadian Highlanders 80/90, Soviet Gornostrelki 80/90, and Polish Strelcy Podahalansky (which needs a 90 variant IMHO) more powerful. The East German Lechter Shutzen got a buff from Regular to Shock, they kept all their stuff as well as their 20 point price, and their MG didn't get a CQC trait. It'd be fair to do the same for the other underpowered, overpriced, and rarely used long-range light infantry, as well. It would also provide a minor boost to US infantry in general, which is universally agreed to be grossly underpowered and in need of buffing. By also buffing the counterpart Soviet unit in the same way, fairness and balance (at least as fair and balanced as this game can be said to be) are maintained. Surely we can all agree this is a reasonable thing to do, in light of Lechter Shutzen getting the exact same upgrade?  EDIT: I mocked up some unit cards for the buffed units. Now, don't these look like the kind of units you'd like to use?  I've thought about it more, and I realized that Highlanders are not just overpriced, they're also worthless because Canadian Airborne come in the same deck types and transports, and then some. Even as shock infantry they'd be redundant at best and slightly inferior at worst. The way to fix this is to make Canadian Airborne available in only helicopters, and Highlanders available in only wheeled transports. Nothing else needs to change.  Similarly, the price of Light Infantry 80 isn't 20 because the Dragon is extremely underpowered compared to the Metys. The Dragon II is fine, and LR90 being 25 points is reasonable. But LR80 can barely kill APCs as it stands, and raising their price would be cruel and pointless. As it stands, they'd be the worst Shock infantry in the game, so why not give them the appropriate price tag?   Also, I did some research- the Poles didn't have any kind of Metys-M/Dragon II equivalent. So no SP90.  It occurs to me, additionally, that perhaps some of the other light infantry units might be rerolled a bit to fit better with this class of unit. Hudou-Ren should be 20 points; Lektor Peckhotka shouldn't have CQC machine guns; and perhaps Legion 80 could be given the non-CQC AA-52 and a 20 point price tag, to line them up with all the other 1980 light infantry units. Then all the 1990 versions would get CQC machine guns (M240 CQC for LR90, RPK-74 for Gorno 90, AA-52 CQC for Legion 90, etc) as a further upgrade to make it worth taking them, as well as to standardize the way light infantry are set up. I'm not sure whether or not Fallschirmjaeger 80/90, Gurkhas 80/90, and Norrlaandsjaegere should even be light infantry, though, since they've got 15-man squads and stuff. Maybe just make them Rifle-type like USMC, Wachtregiment, or Jeogockdae.   EDIT:  So, summary:  Training Buffs  -LR80/90 buffed to Shock  -Gorno 80/90 buffed to Shock  -SP buffed to Shock  -Highlanders 80/90 buffed to Shock  Price Changes  -Legion 80 dropped to 20 pts  -Highlander 80 dropped to 20 pts  -Hudou-Ren dropped to 20 pts  Weapon Changes  -LR 90 M249 instead of M240  -Gorno 90 RPK-74 instead of PKM  -Riflemen 90 M240 instead of M60  -Legion 80 AA-52 (STAT) instead of NF-1 (CQC)  -Hudou-Ren 80 62 Shiki instead of 62L Shiki  -Lekta Pickle Uk. vz. 59 instead of RPK  New Units  -Hudou-Ren 90 (Type 89, PZF 3, 62L Shiki; 25 points)  -Gongobongo 90 (Type 68, SPG-9, RPD; 25 points)  Recategorization  -Gurkhas 80/90 reclassified as Rifle  -Fallskirmsjafger 80/90 reclassified as Rifle  -Norrlandsjagere reclassified as Rifle"

It's still 20 point shock infantry even with the M240 instead of the C2A1, and they get more CGM2 ammo. Besides- Highlanders 90, if made into Shock infantry, would be way better than CAB 85.

wargame,3cu3k6,AnonymousPepper,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:19:53 2015 UTC,"Sure you could, but only if you were going for sheer rate of fire and not aiming really at all.  The 37's in-burst ROF is probably about twice to three times as fast as I'd be willing to assume possible if it had a dedicated loader (sorta does - commander/loader; he's not the one who has to aim the gun, so I'm calling it close enough) and was simply cranking out as fast as it could with only a minimum of aiming (whatever the gunner can do while the loader is shoving rounds in) after it had initially laid in on target.  Hence, almost buy that - it's close enough to the realm of possibility that it's acceptable as a gameplay mechanic, in much the same way as how the T-62A in World of Tanks can reload, aim in fully during the reload, and then fire, all about once every six seconds, which is clearly excessive (it's a figure that assumes it has a functional spent-round ejector, which the T-62A doesn't [it had one, but it was a failure of a prototype]), but we're willing to accept it as good enough.  I mean it's not that accurate of a gun, is it? Not stabilized, to boot.  To be honest though the gun acts like it's got a French-style drum magazine of some sort (albeit an internal one - some of the French ones you had to exit the tank for >_>), in which case the ROF is perfectly believable."

This will render NSWP useless and remove it from competitive level and more people will resort to USSR and Spetz to deal with this. While Formoza/Komandossi combo is very strong, USA has plenty of ways to deal with this (Nighthawks, LVTPA1s, MBT-70s...) The opposite of Delta-komandossi buffed/ SEAL combo, has no proper response from a polish/NSWP deck. Giving one factions main unique advantage to another faction, espacilly a major one, will render the formal one worthless and without any motivation to play it.

I have not used the TOR too much so I can't talk about that, but based on the stats it doesn't excel in anything.  So these three pieces are different enough I think.   Regarding the Patriot.

wargame,3cu3k6,SovietPootis,4,Fri Jul 10 22:06:03 2015 UTC,I don't believe it excels as much as you claim in small games. Mixed NATO has a vast array of broken units to face it.
wargame,3cu3k6,redshield3,-2,Fri Jul 10 22:26:32 2015 UTC,"Mixed nato loses plenty of great units, such as Super Etendard, FSJ '90, Marder 2, Kustjägare '90, all 6hp AA helos, Longbow, Keiler and Patriot. They do keep some of the excellent units such as the panserbil, F-1 and K1, and because of that it's my deck of choice for smaller games.   But nonetheless I have to say that USSR does get slightly longer stick on the matter. Their mid-range planes are plain superior to their mixed bluefor counterpart, and I suppose that's the decisive reason on why they're better."

wargame,3cu3k6,FerrumCenturio,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:07:31 2015 UTC,"Well USSR gets the MIG-27. It's the best ATGM plane at that price point expect maybe the Super Etendard is slightly better, but not necessarily.  PD's are great as they can dispatch their 8HE missiles before blufor infrared - 2 hits are a a guaranteed kill which is NOT the case with blufor counterparts like Mirage 2000. And PD's should be used pairs against multiroles since missing 2 of the 8 missiles would be unlucky.  GR-7 is a nice unit, that I can agree with but I prefer SU-24M. It is just more reliable as a bomber, slightly harder to dodge. It's more of a preference thing tbh.  And Puff is nice, yes, but the advantage Puff has isn't that relevant tbh.

The bradley +20 is wrong way of looking at the atgm situation. You should reduce the price of other atgm carriers, since the bradley is the one in the right place (price wise).   Also why make the ebpv90 65 pts? That would make it the same price the autocannon armored exception optics bmp that NSWP gets, but it only has a machine gun.   75 pts daps are just plain bullshit, it needs numbers because it has less ammo and less range then the helicopters it faces (hind V, NSWP hind). It also doesn't come with rocket pods or yak b to make it good beside being an aa helicopter.   You have a mix of good and really bad ideas. You are making key units of a inf focused coalition that has to fight a nation with 2 high end gunships and is great all round worse.

Making it +5 from that point would be bad. 35 for elite is also too much, but is more justified, since the elite status does help ease the guided downside.  With assault rifle and mg3 it should 35.    same price as the Sokol. I'd take a DAP anyday   Again the wrong perspective. Sokol is just bad. Make sokol more like dap and it is fixed. Also doesn't break the balance with the other aa helicopters.   My view on balance is buff the weak stuff, don't nerf the stuff that is in a good place. This prevents imbalances between unit types and fixed the imbalance in a unit type. It also won't effect the good red/blue balance.   Edit:  The recon vehicle thing 3/2/2 vs 4/2/2 (Swedish recon vehicle). Not enough to warrant a free autocannon."

It is not about which is better, it is about being hard countered by a unit thats costs the same. People need to learn how to fight a paper vehicles with a ship cannon, not just complain about it killing your lightly armored stuff. Same argument as the bmpt balance.    Anyhow the Crotale is underpriced and that at least is clear.   Serious question, underpriced compared to what? Short arrow has 8 missiles and f&f and tungusta m has more ammo and better missiles and a good gun that make it 40 pts better. It also in the same power range as strop 2 (but for a different purpose). Which unit is imbalanced compared to it?    is the same for the Eryx as other RPGs, and let's not forget that higher range translates to higher acc. What does hurt is if they're stunned while firing, but that happens rarely with elites or squads of 15 men.   The aim time of panicked eryx is really horrible (I play a lot of Norway moto) and I just don't see it is better then a vampir/pzf 3, which have similar ap, better fire rate, f&f (no line of sight issues) and slightly less range (700 often equals 1000, but not always). I would say tha FSJ 90 and Heabyung 90 are very comparable and not 5 pts apart. I think your issue is the lack of quality with Redfors 15 men squads, which is a real issue.    it's easier to fix one unit, but I'd be happy if all helos were rebalanced around DAPs, like if all tanks were rebalanced around Leos. The best thing about the DAP is its optics and its acc. Nerf optics and I wouldn't mind it at maybe 65. The cannon's pretty good too, almost Cassiopee-tier.   It is unrealistic to balance from that perspective, since it would requre a full rebalancing of all aa helicopters. The DAP trades range for more accuracy, which is nice way to do assymetric balance. (also how are the optics important, helo rushes should have a recon helicopter for ka 52/ninja/tiger cloaking fields).    The cannon's pretty good too, almost Cassiopee-tier.   Not stabilized, which what makes the Cassiopee so good. Every fixed helicopter cannon is pretty bad for most situations. I would take a turreted yak b (12.7 doomlazer of cheap hinds) over fixed 30mm cannons, since it is so good vs helicopters and inf in forests."

The Oto's 80pts   I just don't see it is better then a vampir/pzf 3   because when those miss it isn't as flashy   Short arrow has 8 missiles and f&f   and is more expensive. With 20% less acc it barely touches planes.   Anyhow in this case being [GUID] is an advantage, for in the past with [F&F] you could gamble a plane in the opening and clean out most of your opponent's AA   tung has better missiles   marginally, not 40pts worth. And the wheels are important and cost something too.   trades range for more accuracy   which means the DAP can down planes, and the others not.

Reducing the costs of low and mid-range tanks is similarly a huge gameplay improvement with no downsides. The issue is, they're quite radical changes.

Why not? Surely you just change the model and program it as a self propelled gun with 0 armour and less mobility? I disagree, they can hide and have the mobility to keep up with infantry. Also cheap. I don't see this being difficult to implement, it's effectively an FOB with different stats. You would select in real time so if you want to dick around you lose. Plus flexibility means that you can help your allies more often. I don't see why this is any different to having specialised planes. Then buff ATGMs, the lack of vision would mean that short range anti-tank would be able to wreck vehicles so it could only be used defensively. Why? That same logic could be applied to vehicles have multiple weapons. Having a jack of all trades make you a master of none. How? Why? It would be expensive and supply draining, the same can be said for heavy artillery units. Plus at the scale of wargame smaller ballistic missiles are used.

Someone with more programming knowledge than me explained it to me some time ago. The engine of this game is very sophisticated at what it does, but very inflexible on the other hand.  The real problem is that it can not simulate towing things - that concept is not compatible with the way it calculates pathing. It's not meant to do that, so it cannot do that. A towing simulation would require a complete redesign of the pathfinding from scratch.  4 That I agree to, we already have such system in the game: It's essentially a transport vehicle, only that it doesn't drop an infantry squad but another logistics vehicle without the ability to move. Althought it might be more complex in the background, I don't know.  5 I remember a dev saying that he really liked this idea. If they do another Wargame, chances are we might see this. I disagree with /u/ural_idiotic , it's a great idea which would buff planes and make them more valuable assets, increasing their usefulness, and in return putting bigger emphasis on the Anti-Air game as well.  6 So... Implementing a thing that makes buffing an entire class of weapons neccesary? I totally don't see how this could go wrong... You are suggesting a massive gamechanger that could completely overthrow the way the game plays. I'm not saying that it would neccesarily make it worse, but it's definitely a thing that requires extensive, large-scale testing.  8 Certain units have certain transports at their disposal irl, it's just the way the military works to ensure fast, uncomplicated pickup and delivery of troops. You are not going to see Marines riding in an Army Bradley or VDV in BTRs. The current system is perfect.  9 We do have ballistic missiles, it's called the ATACMS. Why does only the US get them? Hell I don't know.  Also, just accept that there will be no major changes to the game anymore. All we can do is sit tight and hope they do another - and ask the community for this kind of brainstorming before doing so.  EDIT: stupid reddit formatting"
wargame,3cw3mb,Eurasian-HK,0,Sat Jul 11 10:54:41 2015 UTC,"You would do it like you were creating another self propelled gun, but use a different visual model and use stats like ""0 armour"". It adds another dimension to the game, popping smoke means that long range weapons are useless within the smoke and makes a more chaotic infantry focused fight. That means you could only really use smoke to withdraw from something like an ATGM attack. Using it offensively would not end well. Having a particular vehicle assinged to your squad isn't how transport works, especially for more complex transport (ie. choppers or IFVs)."
wargame,3cw3mb,Ace40k,3,Sat Jul 11 11:07:50 2015 UTC,The game engine is not able to model vehicles with articulation so you cannot have towed pieces because of this. Also this is a bad idea as the last thing we need is more arty.

wargame,3cw3mb,Itsalrightwithme,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:50:09 2015 UTC,"Empty transports of any type should be able to ""tow"" or ""sling"" a light field gun, occupying its infantry-carrying slot. The gun itself would only be about 30-50 points, but it would be in the Infantry tab, making the choice difficult. The availability would also be very low, and the guns wouldn't be very high in HE. No heavy artillery allowed, only stuff that can be slung under helicopters- 122mm would be the highest caliber, I think, that ought to be allowed. Mortar teams are a terrible idea IMO. Being able to fire artillery from within a city block... it makes me shudder to think of the game-breaking."

You just cant do anything if the nuke the whole forrest (maybe the avaibility down or longer reload times with higher supply costs or maybe even buff the top armor of the tanks just by 1 point) regardless if u move your Units or not. And i dont mean the HE Arty I mean that dumb spamy cluster arty which just shredds through Tanks...(I know its their purpose but if they just blow up MBT's like it would be nothing... kinda sucks) (which is most annoying in the 10 vs 10 TACTICAL) (not that spamy normal 10 vs 10 mode)

Take a normal map, take out a few bridges and roads around/up a mountain, add a couple of villages there and you've turned a stock standard map into a different affair altogether, you create an area dominated by infantry (infantry can be airlifted + villages). Or take  river filled map, knock out a few bridges and there's an added logistical challenge to the game of crossing the rivers."

It will polarise deck builds. That is also NOT what makes the game fun.  Last, there is one desert map,which name I cannot recall, it's full of difficult terrain that favours air, and guess what, it's not very popular, turns out, that's NOT what makes the game fun."

There are a few things that make them very uncompetitive as things stand and I think they would be fairly easy to remedy. I also see nobody playing the Blue Dragons - but I don't know what to suggest for them.  Lack of a top level tank (T90 is not a top level tank, it is Kyu Maru Shiki level): Chinese Type 99 MBT  Lack of a top level interceptor: New SU27  Lack of a fast aiming 155mm artillery piece: PLZ-45  Lack of Decent  Long Range AA: Buk (They use it)  Lack of an infantry ATGM: ???  Lack of a powerful attack helicopter: Modernised Hind?   Lack of Elite Recon 10 Man Infantry: North Korean Something or Other  They don't need everything, but some of the perks enjoyed by other factions would be great.  Finally - please take the time to model some canards on the SU33 (SU27PU).  These changes would take the Red Dragons to a much more competitive state which I think would really improve the game given how diverse and interesting they are.

wargame,3cobfw,SovietPootis,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:30:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree about the T-90S. I'd put it up with Challenger 2 and Leopard 2A5. Two best tanks for killing other tanks right now I'd say are M1A2 and the T-72BU. They're the only tanks that can really go toe to toe with each other. Next level I'd say is T-90S, Challenger 2, Leopard 2A5. After that is all the pseudo Super-Heavies such as the Kyu Maru Shiki, T-80UM, Leclerc, Strv 121, M1A1(HC), Moderna/Twardy.   Overall the RD tank department is not the worst. The T-90S combined with some of the super cost effective Chinese tanks makes a pretty workable tab. They need help in other areas so that their most competitive deck isn't a motorized deck. Namely they need a good gunship with atgms, a better cost effective fighter, better SEAD, and better AA. They have a pretty solid infantry tab. With the Jeo' 90 with carbines, tanke '85, Li Jian, Yucks, plus all their transports with auto cannons. They just need some better heavy AA and planes. Right now it revolves around spamming JH-7s and the occasional B-5."

Why: Currently this is somewhat nick picking, but imo blue dragons does lack a 2 man sniper team. Currently every coalition has one, so I suppose they should get one too, SK has the elite Recon unit and imo its fine. More Recon units would be welcomed, but I couldn't find any atm, maybe the hayates? Flamethrower infantry Why? Japan does has M9 flamethrower. Just not a lot. UH-60J (first received in 91) Why: Prob just nitpicking some more, but it wouldn't be bad.

I do agree that houdou-ren are useless at present, except perhaps in the moto deck. However, they don't need PzF3, the coalition already has one. A CG3 for them and perhaps the Korean udt/seals might work, but probably be five points extra =/  A sniper team would look nice in the armory but I probably wouldn't take them. Give them to ROK, I would use them in that deck.  An amphibious recon vehicle would be sweet, but redundant coalition-wise. I would like 3 cards of kyu-roku and for Jsdf rangers to get them, and also Nana-san for amphib.   Re the napalmers this could be nice, every other coalition has 10 man fire, and blue dragons only have assault engineers and they suck since the cover buffs.   Re the F-15DJ Japan already has a crappy multirole. What would you put on it? I'd take 12 rockeyes and four sidewinders. Or the Harrier GR7 load out, It'd be like a double strength F1. It would be expensive as hell though and I probably wouldn't use it.   Japan has weak infantry but that's its flavor. It's OP enough in several other areas; 4 ninjas and 4 F1 is easy mode: the Tung M becomes obsolete. You can bring more damage output to an opening tank engagement than any other one player. A truly sky-clearing fighter spam: with the F4s on elite, I still get 720pts worth of asf on just 2 cards. And the tan-sam is the only unit quite as hontastic as crotale, combining 3325m and 150kph.

You just want to cut down Buratino, Smerch, BTR-90, MiG-25PD and MiG-27. And in return, to reduce T-72, T-72A, T-64A and T-72B price to compensate. But who needs T-72 even for 40 points? Just take a look at beautiful Leopard 1A4 or Chieftain Mk.5 and you will understand what i mean. The same thing in ~65 points category and even ~85.

wargame,3cobfw,frankwouter,2,Thu Jul 9 22:07:20 2015 UTC,"3At the moment i think Elites and Recon elires should be reviewed, recon elites, in my opinion are perhaps a little too good; most of the these units can do too much. Good optics,  excellent infantry killers and often good-excellent AT. These infantry units shoukd not be line infantry.  I myself only use recon infantryvin my 1v1 US deck. I have a card of Stingers , 2x rangers and 2x SEALs,; sadly it actually works.  I really hope eugen make regular infantry modt viable/ appealling for all the factions, rather than this Elite heavy meta we have now."
wargame,3cobfw,Jasperjons,3,Thu Jul 9 17:46:15 2015 UTC,"They only come at 4/7 per card, so can't be used like line inf in normal games.   And this is a pretty major meta change that could upset the whole inf balance in a bad way.  And rangers are shock inf, which is not elite.   The option that I would see is to make shock recon 5 pts more then comparable shock inf and make all elite recon inf 35 or 40 pts.   (This is beyond your bad example, because that how USA works, because giving them good normal inf would make other bluefor pointless).   Making line inf 25 per card would also help, considering shock inf comes at around 12 per card (arbitrary numbers, just 2:1 availability, in which line inf beats shock inf.)"

Im not saying that elites need a nerf or price rise, but when choosing infantry in my deck there should be some incentive to bring Regulars over the elites/shock.  I wasnt exaggerating about no infantry in my US deck, my INF tab only has a stinger team, i dont bother with rifles or marines at all, which i feel is a huge missed oppunity to add more to infantry fight ing."
wargame,3cobfw,nani_sore,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:15:06 2015 UTC,"The game has always been like that and changing it this late is risky, because it might just break the whole inf balance.

wargame,3cobfw,frankwouter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:51:40 2015 UTC,"Scandinavia balance is a little tricky. It can be really powerfull in the right situation, but it's aa is still really weak to sead and it lacks long range fighting power. People just don't know how to counter Scandi and then say it is OP.   Let's say they nerf the eots hawk, what are we supposed to use as aa in that case. They only have 1 card of nasams and some radar hawks vs buks, tor, osa and tungi that redfor gets. Rbs 90 can't handle all aa on their own. It is very easy to mess it up and push it back to pre update level. It only has a limited number of units and all of them are crucial. This is even more true for the minors, which are super fun and balanced specialized decks because they have a few really good units.   Even ottomagic is very easy to counter with a t72b that costs the price and has more per card.   20 pts panserbill would be a good thing though. Together with 10% nerf to Scandi coalition availability bonus.  But they should indeed focus on al the vehicles that have better recon versions and sub 60 pts tanks that could become amazing fire support/forest fighting assets if they got a little more autonomy and accuracy."

They get so many strv121, gripen, etc and the infantry are amazingly cost effective and come in amazing transports. I know those are their coalition strengths and that's the character of that faction, but it feels like their bonuses are particularly suited to the current meta."

You just need the right deck to counter it. Scandinavia can't fight Russia on open maps and Russia can't fight Scandinavia in a forest without good spetznatz and grenade launcher abuse. All sort of works out (like how USA should not do inf fights).  NSWP makes a great counter to Scandinavia and that's there only reason for being played, since Russia outclasses them in non inf combat."

wargame,3cobfw,nani_sore,2,Thu Jul 9 16:56:50 2015 UTC,"I don't play 1v1 so my only experience is 3v3 and up (which what the majority plays).   But for larger games, lots of sead to keep the ottomatic offline and use your atgm advantage with the bmp 3 and missile tanks. Use your pu to dominate Scandi fighters. And all Scandi stuff is low armor (most aa is 5 hp 0 armor), so it is vunrable to artillery.    Use cheap gunships and autocannons to kill panserbills and be careful for rbs 56.   Spetz gru and normal spetz is very strong vs Scandi inf and Russia had amazing fire support to help out.   It's not easy, but there are gaps you can abuse."
wargame,3cobfw,nani_sore,3,Thu Jul 9 17:17:34 2015 UTC,"Its unfair to say simple because the game is ""mostly"" 3v3 and upwards that the balance is ok.   Scandanavia is incredibly poeerful in 1v1s and i do think the ottomatic and ,to a lesser degree, Nasams need a review"
wargame,3cobfw,Futski,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:37:32 2015 UTC,"Counter ottomagic with tanks and consider it a heavy tank and you should be fine. The thing is a radar based thin can with a cannon that fires ke rounds that dont hurt medium heavy tanks at range (basically a ground longbow, it makes the enemy loose more if they already loose). Nasams is radar aa and like all radar aa, it can be hit by sead. It also priced in a good way considering the limited range (I know osa, but osa is slightly overpriced) (Scandi mirror matches must be funny since neither has good sead ability).   Balancing 1v1 and higher together is very hard. How would you make the 1v1 more balanced without making it weak vs Russia in 4v4? Serious question btw.   Beyond reducing availability bonus and making panserbill 20 pts, I don't think there is that much things to do."

Many helicopters will nose up hard to stop and try to fire its weapons, this is bascially sucicde. If you have F&F weapons like Stingers or Mistrals, you dont attack move, you just MOVE FORWARD and the missiles will go off the rack without the chopper doing something silly.  This is especially true for TY90s and DAPs.  Another good tip is to pair SEAD with your attacking aircraft to protect it, rather than using it solo, this creates a problem for the other player as he must decide whether to risk his AA or his combat units. (But players MUST LEARN what AA each faction has and whether its RADAR or IR.)"

This is especially true for TY90s and DAPs.   Even truer for Hinds: once they reach close quarters, their armor and nose gun let them shred lighter platforms to tiny pieces really quick... They just have to close in as fast as possible to negate the Supercobra and DAP's standoff dominance.  Of course that requires critical mass to absorb the losses while closing in, keeping spacing to avoid AOE multikills and keeping a formation that strikes the balance between fire concentration and munition-wasting overkill (I recommend 'line abreast')."

The former has more IR air-to-air missiles while the Molnyas of the 24-P are a credible threat to airplanes.  I don't remember the outcome of Mi-24 vs. DAP one on one, but it is usually a bit more complicated than that as the goal is not just to down the escort but to annihilate the raid's payload - especially if it includes MANPADS in general and SAS in particular. By the time most of the escort has been dealt with, my AA helos always find themselves out of IR missiles so it usually turns into a knife fight against the transports and what is left of the infantry they carried."

It's true, a tutorial would be more enjoyable to learn from, but you simply cannot pack all of the micro going on in this game into a tutorial. It would take hours to go through the guide in-game, it would be boring and noone would be willing to go through it.  Understanding the underlying mechanics to draw own conclusions like /u/nated0ge described is more expedient."

Amphibious vehicles are very weak and the cover near the water makes sure they get killed with rpgs while in the water. You will also need aa to move up with your forces (not map specific statement) and  good amphibious aa is very rare on bluefor.

wargame,3cnqrs,frankwouter,0,Thu Jul 9 15:59:18 2015 UTC,It has been mostly goofy deck fun. Most people running minor nation decks and such. We have had many draws and some losses. It's just that you sometimes have all the 1k games mods together with an organised strategy and then you get 15 min games.
wargame,3cnqrs,redshield3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:27:03 2015 UTC,Frank you play a lot more Euro timezone games... the US timezone 10vs games are practically all 15min games. It sucks. Until the ANZAC boys get on but by then I should have been in bed for hours.
wargame,3cnqrs,frankwouter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:23:27 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that it would be too much work and it would further increase the difficulty for new players that join the game (which already have issues with recognising pubstomps).   And it would split up community, because large communities would go full inhouse and that would cause a big brain drain on public games.   The community is just to small and fragmented to really make it work."
wargame,3cnqrs,ArchOwl,2,Thu Jul 9 15:08:54 2015 UTC,"Yes you could be right about the small size of the community being a major downfall of map editor.  I'm not sure how many players would actively try to create maps, and in StarCraft where there are still probably a minimum 100k players (don't know exact numbers as I haven't played in a while) still only a few select actually make extremely balanced yet interesting/fun maps to play, and the majority of the players who fall into this category have been making maps for years and are quite experienced.  I guess your right, let's just hope Eugen gives us some good ones.  Also I don't know why you are getting downvoted for bringing up legit concerns/discussion."

wargame,3cpkf7,a_grated_monkey,6,Thu Jul 9 21:48:53 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to learn is to join us on the teamspeak.   Judging by what you're saying, it sounds like you're mostly playing single player, which is bad in RD at least. The AI cheats and spams. You want it for the multiplayer.  In terms of friendliest, I would think EE. The single player is actually decent. I don't know about the tutorial. Red dragon is kinda unfriendly. The tutorial is horrible.  Defense and offense is a question of game mode and generally what the situation is. For example, in the enemy is heavily fortified, and it's a conquest game where another zone is more easily taken, then don't attack. If it's destruction, then try not to attack.  Due to size, you kinda need to be able to micro and macro, but if I had to choose one, I would say micro. Units can be dumb sometimes.  It all depends on which stats and pricing. For example, the M8 AGS might only have a 17 AP gun vs an 18 AP gun (m1 Abrams?) but the M8's faster rate of fire means it can do more damage faster than an Abrams can.  Again, don't play RD singleplayer, as the AI is a cheater.  Yeah, some units suck, like blowpipes. Never use them. A good choice is the T72 BU. It is really powerful. But use your OP units carefully. They're usually expensive, low availability. If you try to tank rush your BU, and you have taken no precautions, you can lose it very easily.  For combat, you need to learn all three.  Woulda posted earlier, but my net is stupid."

wargame,3cpkf7,Kakya,2,Fri Jul 10 00:04:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, 50/50. 10v10s are huge and people won't really notice your skill or lack thereof. Smaller games are more fun, but players can be a bit standoffish on who's allowed in server.  My best advice is to start a noobs only server while starting to play against people who are around your level to get fun games where people won't be as arrogant. Just watch out for veterans joining a noobs only server hoping for a noobstomp. Expect a learning curve and welcome to Wargame!"
wargame,3cpkf7,a_grated_monkey,2,Fri Jul 10 00:13:18 2015 UTC,"Yea, the learning curve seems steep.  I was able to get EU4 down relatively quick, so I'm not too worried.   But man, talk about info overload."
wargame,3cpkf7,frankwouter,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:20:30 2015 UTC,"Just get in, start playing. Start some 3v3s or 4v4s with people around your skill level (check and control for skill level in lobby) and just play. Watch replays if you lose, you'll get it. It'll take some time and some soul searching after particularly harsh losses, but once it clicks, there aren't many better games around.   Yeah, the learning curve is a lot steeper than EU4, probably close to HOI3, for a PDS example. Hop onto the Deck building thread to check out some sample decks for inspiration."

wargame,3cozrw,osaka_amd,2,Thu Jul 9 17:17:28 2015 UTC,"It is much better, since UK is very slow and has really good armor and Norway is really fast. They make a really nice balanced force together, sort of how Eurocorps works (french moto+German mech/armor).  Norway also fixed the fire support issue of the UK. And Ghurka 90 + jager and eryx spam would be brutal.   Landjut is just Germany and eots hawk, mlu, ottomatic and FKP. And they are both strong mech, which makes the unspec deck much weaker."

wargame,3cozrw,Chimpville,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:56:36 2015 UTC,"Well if you gave the UK the Starstreak manpad (5 man, only 5HE manpad) to help close that gaping hole in the AA net I'd be a happier with a LAW-80 nerf and that SAS are now useless. Need to check out UGM again.  Edit: you have an installer/uninstaller now. Brilliant! It wasn't a huge nause to switch before but easier is always better.

wargame,3cozrw,nated0ge,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:31:01 2015 UTC,"I am wary of more coalitions that have no weaknesses. When you start mixing and matching to remove weaknesss the factions start to lose their distinguish ing characteristics and risk becoming just another generic meta deck.  Thats not to say its a bad concept, actually as far as background goes i think its very cool and flavourful.   But i think we should try to avoid removing weaknesses from factions as a ""feature"" of a deck."
wargame,3cozrw,frankwouter,3,Thu Jul 9 18:25:33 2015 UTC,"I think it would stil be a special deck, since British units are unique and Commonwealth doesn't really fit them (doesn't fix the aa issue and spetznatz issue that makes British almost unplayable vs the nation that had everything (Russia)). Norway would make British units competitive vs the large coalitions."
wargame,3cozrw,Kappa043,3,Thu Jul 9 22:20:17 2015 UTC,"This deck does actually have weaknesses, though. First of all, the availability would be minimal. Second, it has no engineers or any kind of flame anything whatsoever, making it the only coalition to completely lack all such weapons. (There's one CF-104 napalm plane, yes, but it's trash.) It also doesn't have a dedicated iron bomber or a good ATGM plane, it lacks severely in supply, and it has only one super-heavy tank. There's plenty of other weaknesses, but my point is that AFNORTH is just as balanced as any other coalition. SOVKOR and NORAD are no less OP."

Honestly none of these things you mentioned strike me as massive weaknesses.  NORAD is interesting, I don't rate it highly because Canada brings very little to the table. Same with SovKOr; SovKOr is actually Soviet with a T90 and the B5, other wise it offers very little. I find in both cases the factions don't get anything substantial so I have no probable a with either of those. It seems to me after the beta with many players complaining about Eurocorp and commonwealth Eugen has learnt to not pair strong factions together which is nice."
wargame,3cozrw,nated0ge,-1,Fri Jul 10 08:53:58 2015 UTC,"It still not better then a Russia deck, which what it will fight all day long. Making weak coalitions is pointless, since they are unplayable vs Russia spam 4 v 4 and 1 v 1."

For bomber: su24m is really nice of you pair it with the 80 pts sead plane. It prevents being shot at with radar aa and the sead plane can work as a missile catcher.    For atgm plane: su 27m is really nice, but expensive and only 1 per card. If you can handle it, use it.  The cheapest and most expensive mig 27 are also excellent choices, they are fast and have good missiles.  I also like the cheap su 25, the ap gun and missiles give it plenty of killing power and the turning circle and armor allows good control and double runs. The slow speed does cause really slow response times. I also like the massive he rockets that make more versatile by killing inf.

Mig-29s will be good for smaller games where the AA net(specifically the IR net) is thinner. Thing is troops might be able to jump away from the AOE.  Su24m as you should already know will cover a huge area and damage/stun the fuck out of everything so it's well worth the sacrifice early on.     The least and most expensive mig27s are the choices. the expensive one has some range so it's a missile crapshoot. The other is cheaper and requires some management to avoid a chance to miss but if you nail that it can side shot things really well and you get 3 of them."
wargame,3cohwh,Aeweisafemalesheep,2,Thu Jul 9 18:49:59 2015 UTC,"Hey mate,  Regarding ASF: The logic of the MIG25PDs is that you call out all 3 and its scary to deal with 3 fighters like that at once, compared to a single SU27PU. This likely comes down to personal choice. Personally I perfer using the MIG23 MLD if I want a cheaper """"swarm""fighter.  Bombers : Again this comes down to personal preference. I like using the SU24  because it does a lot of things well; the 30x 250KG bombs will actually kill a LeClerc if the spread is good. And its very useful for clearing infantry, its probably the best choice in my opinion.  Many people dont like the MIG29 because it doenst do anything welll, multi role isnt very popular because its simply not that good at anything.  THe trick of course is to call out bombers with SEAD support to force the other player to accept a unit loss or an AA loss, But I would avoid calling out any bomber if the AA is good. The IL 102 is also worth considering since the gun on it is the same as the SU25 and it will kill tanks reliably.  But I stress again that dumb bombers need to be used with care,try to call them out conservatively; the longer they live, the more annoying they are to the enemy. In my opinion bombers are best used to grind down the enemy; strike where they are weak, go back, rearm and repeat.  Lastly the ATGM. The MIG27 is in  my opinion, the best ATGM plane  on the Red side. In 1v1 its very strong since its got F&F missiles, fast and got a very good gun. Its almost guaranteed to kill any tank.  The SU25 and the 25T are both good, but mostly in 1v1 where AA is much less intense and the armour worth more in that type of environment. Generally in bigger games you want the MIG27 because its in and out, reducing the risk of bumping into an enemy fighter and AA. in 1v1 loitering is much less risky because the enemy will be strained for points to invest heavily in AA.   Cluster bombs are usless since EUgen nerfed them back in ALB, so I wouldnt bother with most of them."

wargame,3cohwh,frankwouter,2,Thu Jul 9 15:29:35 2015 UTC,"SU24 seems to be more consistent for me, and calling SEAD along with it makes it much more survivable. But I still miss from time to time with it :( Especially against an incoming column. I tends to attack ground, but usually the enemy will just spread out, and I don't want to risk re-targetting since if the distance is not far away enough, the plane will overshoot and turn around to make another pass, which usually means death :("
wargame,3cohwh,HolyAndOblivious,2,Fri Jul 10 20:38:28 2015 UTC,ASFs: you either go for the PDs or for the PUs. I preffer the PDs because they are cheaper. Its a matter of which suits your tactics better.  BOMBERs: 24m is a no brainer. IL is scary. Migs are not that good. Go for the cheap 70pt napalm plane to clear out infantry.  ATGM : su27m is the better plane but the 145pt plane is cheaper and has more availability. I would go for the latter. If it dies killing the m1a2 it has done its job and you still have more of em. The frogfoot is situational. Its insanely good If the enemy is light on AA.  The truth is that it depends on what fits your playstyle. The best way to do an airstrike is to always combine it with SEAD planes and arty. This way you improve your effectiveness ten fold
wargame,3cohwh,liotier,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:24:23 2015 UTC,"Su-25, well only when my team is rolling over, it is just a win-more plane to me   Nicely stops an armored spearhead if you use other assets to strip the AA component off it - and only then let the Su-25 loose on it. JAAT is beautiful - when it works... You can't spell ""Airland Battle"" without 'jointness' !  But I seldom have a Su-25 in my decks - I have enough heliborne ATGM to provide the anti-armor cavalry capability while freeing an aviation slot."
wargame,3cohwh,zman122333,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:51:56 2015 UTC,"ASF - You get 2 MIG-25PDs with elite training in a standard deck where you only get one PU at a much lower training level.  The PU is absolutely a better plane 1v1, but the fact that the MIG-25PD is cheaper and more available tilts the balance IMO.    Anti Tank - I use the SU-27M as my go-to.  The high AP on its AT missiles allow it to destroy the heaviest of tanks.  It also has 4 F&F 7,000m range AMRAMs, making it a viable option to support your 25PDs in the ASF role.  Just use it very carefully.  When using the AT plane, you can use it similar to a SEAD plane if your target is alone (or closest to your plane).  Run the AT plane off to the flank, then run it in close to parallel with the enemy line.  This will allow you to avoid flying deep into the enemy AA network.    Good luck."

On a crit they one-shot anything and they're cheap enough to act as decoys for you more expensive jets.  Great for a meatshield or dealng the killing blow for a bargain price.

Cuz by stats the MIG25 seems better (better ECM, longer range SEAD missiles) but seems you guys are recommending SU24 SEAD usually?"
wargame,3cohwh,steveraptor,2,Thu Jul 9 17:23:04 2015 UTC,"The mig 25 sead is really expensive and only 1 per card, which makes it difficult to call in and really painful if you loose it.   It is best used a radar aa hunter.  The su24 makes a nice purchase to go with an fighter or bomber and is still sufficient for its duties. And you get a second one as backup or  for letting both circle around for 100 % sead cover."
wargame,3cnmq0,Pimpin_Slav,6,Thu Jul 9 08:39:44 2015 UTC,"Start by only using them defensively, as it's difficult for the enemy to bring their AA net up as they make an offensive. Using planes offensively (and gunship helicopters for that matter) is only good in very specific circumstances in which you have confirmed knowledge or strong suspicion of gaps in the enemy AA net.  For example many new players will try and rely on bombers to suppress enemy infantry when attacking an entrenched position, when it's much more cost efficient and less risky to cover your approaching troops by laying down a nice line of smoke with mortars (using the shift key to que up firing commands).  Also, the approaching at the right angle can drastically increase the chances of a bomber surviving."

It is a really nice unit, since it has enough damage output to kill planes by itself during 1 pass (4 missiles fired), it's f&f, so the missiles always hit or miss after being fired and it even has a decent helicopter range and is also really fast, so it can easily dodge stuff and move a long distance withouth running out of fuel (the issue with the eots hawk)."

As for clearing out fighters, buddy below has the right idea, bait them into your AA net. The patriot is a beautiful thing for this, but NASAMS or some Hawks will do the job as well. It works really well against the AI, but alot of players will see a circling fighter close to enemy lines as bait. because that's what it is, and people aren't stupid.

When you jump from outside to inside a building, this can reset a bomber's bomb drop.  Also, try to come from the side (if I recall), a fighter will always evac towards your spawn, so if you angle it right, it will evac towards your lines straight away, rather than doing a 180 over the enemy.

Using 15 pts transports for stinger inf is just pushing it past the point of a reasonable price for the transportations, especially if you also have 5 and 10 pts options that do the same job.   Let's take Russian atgms tanks as a nice comparison. They offer a hot like missile for 5-10 pts. This is considered an okay price (even with the advantage of having an armored atgm carrier).  You are paying 5 pts for 3 Milan 1 (which could all miss and are easily emptied with some micro).  You will usually not rearm them, because it just takes too much supplies.   Just keep a recon tank nearby your manpads and you should be good. It's not like the poor optics on the fuchs will spot any recon vehicles with medium stealth firing at them."

And as much as I would love to transport my infantry in Russian tanks, where dual-purpose atgm cannons are common, that is obviously not an option. A dedicated ATGM carrier to back them up would of course be nicer, but the wiesel tow-2 which I use as an ATGM carrier is 50 points, a bit to much for to protect infantry that have a chance of not even needing it. I really like the idea of a recon tank instead, but 1) this involves me dumping something else and 2) A crappy recon tank failing is not that less likely than a crappy atgm transport failing (not that I expect cheap sneak attack guards to perform greatly). And while there are %100 better solutions for good guarding, this is one that didn't require any additional slots in a deck that I went for maximum flexibility with and use 95% percent of the time I'm on BLUEFOR."

Also, how can run of room in a German only deck? (Since EC uses mistral as manpads). You only need 4 cards of recon and the fifth is pretty much free choice. The total are also never an issue and there is always points for 1 vehicle. And use 2 jagers to help protect a flank is a good usage of jagers. They are pretty though to remove considering your price.   Recon leopards are also not chappy tanks vs stuff with autocannons. It has enough armor to resist autocannon fire and also has medium stealth. It is also decent at killing inf (which fuchs utterly fails in unless you get a 4 v 1 engagement vs chappy rpg inf).

Why pay 5 pts more on every squad inf when it almost never kills anything in time. It will die while the second missile is in flight vs a btr 80a/90. The morale damage from being under reduces accuracy to pretty never gonna hit levels.  The better unit for that situation is the marder 1a3 (or 2).

The only Nation that can do atgms right is Russia, with bmp 3 and t80 A working together.   And I did try to use the atgm version of the skot 2, but the missiles just don't do anything."

wargame,3ckrk0,frankwouter,2,Wed Jul 8 22:30:23 2015 UTC,K1 is the scariest tank out there at those points. In a stand up fight you're really hoping to get the first hit so he suffers a minus to his rate of fire. Strv 103d doesn't scare me at all. Take advantage of its lack of a turret. Hit it from more than one direction. I wouldn't fight it one on one to the front. I think it just matters who sees who first in that situation.

wargame,3ckrk0,wienerschnitzle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:33:24 2015 UTC,"For 75 pts on NATO it's really good at killing missiles, what else have you got? Dollar for dollar chamsuri is the best CIWS NATO can buy. I admit the kongo is pretty good for missile defence but that's a single ship.  Most bluefor ships are sorely lacking in CIWS, and when redfor swarm missiles they get overwhelmed easily. But for half the cost of an OHP you can get the same CIWS firepower if not more. Adding 2 chamsuris to your fleet means the missile swarm needs to be that much larger to even counter the CIWS (let alone cause damage). I recently played some games against AI on the multi-island map (the one with the big central mountain island) where I specifically gave them a navally focused deck and my team primarily Anti-ship and amphibious units (the idea would be I would have to hold open the straits long enough for our superior ground troops to prevail. It was fckn hard. Often I couldn't fly anti-ship sorties because the enemy fleet was too big. I could wack individual ships but even a couple together was too much. My point is that chamsuris make it that much harder to attack a fleet and often that's enough.  Also they do have other uses, they are decent against light boats (especially good versus light redfor missile boats who lack good guns and whos ASMs fail against such dense CIWS) or amphibious vehicles trying to cross water. They're also not bad for slight area AA (especially versus choppers) and can do some shore bombardment if you need them to."

From the opening to the end game. A pair of them in the opening composition just destroys pretty much any threat head on when microed well in medium range. they are fantastic to push in the open and play aggressive land grabs right on the get go. They are amazing forest fighters and great infantry support tanks, as well as great 80-90 point tank killers. Yesterday i used them to stop a scandi opening with 4x Kustjaeges 90, Ottomatic, STRV103D some panserbills and line inf on valley map at the center forest past charlie. Supporting my VDV and Sappery/BTR-T they demolished everything and i won that engagement with minimum casualties, this resulted in me pushing at the enemy spawn at min 7. from open field pushes, engaging enemy armor and forest warfare, they pay themselves double at least and the only reason i lose them is because i get over confident with them and forget they aren't immortal."

wargame,3ch42l,pelukken,8,Thu Jul 9 12:28:47 2015 UTC,"Well, regarding measuring tool, it has been asked and answered why there isn't one...   Unfortunately a feature like that isn't as simple to design as you may think.  Let's say we use a 2D ruler to measure the distance between the edge of a forest and potential targets, in order to know if your ATGMs have or not the range needed to hit targets.  The ATGM's path is calculated in 3D, therefore it won't be the same distance value as the one you had with your 2D Ruler and the ruler was useless at best, misleading at worst.  If you decide to measure in 3D to avoid this kind of problem, you can perhaps measure distance between a user-defined point on the map's floor and a unit but then you can't measure a 3D distance if you don't have vision over units...  What I mean to say is that we get that you would like to see this. We too would like to do this but it's complicated to design a nice ruler that could fit multiple uses and not just be a decorative feature for 8/10 players.   source"
wargame,3ch42l,aptex14,6,Tue Jul 7 23:08:16 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the design challenge, but I think a generic value (say 2 meters) above ground at both points would be serviceable (and should be supported by the engine). Measurements taken that do not also have line of sight values (say, distance along a road that goes over a hill) could simply display a 2D distance (which is still useful for estimating relative travel times, etc.). I don't think a perfect solution is really necessary."

wargame,3cfmb0,Hard_boiled_Badger,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:01:25 2015 UTC,True. New maps would breathe some life back into the game but only until act of aggression is released. At which point most of the community here will jump ship to that game. Assuming act of aggression isn't a total turd.
wargame,3cfmb0,frankwouter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:36:55 2015 UTC,It is a total turd from a wargame position. People will keep playing wargame because it is different game then act of aggression.   And keep in mind that Eugen games never work in first 3-6 months.
wargame,3cfmb0,Hard_boiled_Badger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:48:49 2015 UTC,I agree. Wargame is a different game. But the majority of the current community is going to stop playing wargame after act of aggression comes out. Whether that be because they started playing act of aggression or they just moved on from wargame as it ages. Only those who are interested in the subject matter will remain but it will be limited to preorganized games and getting friends to play a round or two. This game already has a problem retaining new players and near the time act of aggression comes out multiplayer population will plummet.

wargame,3cfmb0,frankwouter,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:14:13 2015 UTC,The best way to learn is to watch videos and now what they do specifically and think about why they do it. Then playing the game will be exponentially easier.
wargame,3cfmb0,DesertEagle5,-2,Wed Jul 8 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"Multiplayer is largely dead and getting deader, and the game itself gets kinda repetitive pretty fast. Truth be told, it's 90% building decks, and 10% actually playing the game(And dealing with the god awful community).  There isn't really any matchmaking outside of ranked play, so you're stuck going to lobbies and potentially getting kicked for being new and/or not having stats other people in the lobby approve of.  Honestly I'd probably pass and get something like Assault Squad 2, but if you want something really laid back and slow, Wargame is an interesting quirk in the genre, albeit too simplistic to keep you hooked very long. The game goes in a bunch of directions, and doesn't really do well in any of them, though does just well enough to where you can  mess around a bit and blow a bit of time without getting into RTS games that are more 1v1 focused and stressful.  Balance leaves a lot to be desired, and the constant dice-rolling means you can often win or lose based off of little more than the chance of some unit one-shotting a particularly important piece of equipment at the right moment, or even something as asinine as artillery decapping a control zone because of killing some arbitrary jeep.  oh, and don't even bother with naval. No one else does. The single player blows pretty hard too because somewhere along the line, AI took a serious nose-dive in the sequels. It's all just really awkward and disjointed, and honestly, feels a bit slapped together.  If a casual RTS is what you're looking for, look no further. This game controls so simply you could legit play it on an Ipad and not notice any significant drop in control. Units are neatly bundled together, and their commands pretty much begin and end with ""move, stop, attack, hold fire"" with no sort of 'micro abilities' and such to take into account, let alone base building, resource gathering, tech paths, unit upgrades, or any other particular staples of the genre. It's more or less just a straight up deathmatch sort of game that happens to have some territory control shoehorned in.  If you want something slow, easy, and defense-focused, pick it up. If you want base building, faster pace, complexity, and other things, look elsewhere."
wargame,3cfmb0,frankwouter,2,Tue Jul 7 21:40:27 2015 UTC,"You are really missing the complexity of wargame and you should go back to starcraft.   This game is nice in how it creates interesting and challenging gameplay withouth relying on micro or active abilities. The lack of base building also allows player to focus all attention on the actual fighting. The large maps and the line of sight system and the large deck variety creates many different scenarios each game.   The multiplayer is still going strong and the reddit teamspeak has 10-30 people in it, many of them playing inhouse or smaller games. And beyond that are a healthy number of game lobbies and servers.   The only issue is the lack of matchmaking, but teamspeak servers fix issue really well with a the small downside of 30 min queue time at worst."
wargame,3cfmb0,Sedition7988,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:54:50 2015 UTC,"withouth relying on micro   That is kinda fun :D . Wargame relies heavily on microcontrol.

wargame,3cfmb0,frankwouter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:42:04 2015 UTC,"It sort of depends on the game settings. Tactical games focus on unit micro, but larger games are more about tactics on a larger scale.   It is the difference between scoot and shoot tactics and using good positioning."
wargame,3cfved,Warzonekilla,8,Tue Jul 7 16:21:11 2015 UTC,"A SEAD plane can detect any radar. If you turn it off (by hitting the button or pressing H) it can't do that anymore. However if there is already an anti-radar missile in the air when you switch it off, it will hit the last known location, so you need to move the unit as well."

wargame,3cfved,Cole7rain,12,Tue Jul 7 16:39:01 2015 UTC,"Nobody in this thread has given you a fully clear answer:  Any wargame player worth their salt is putting their radar AA in control groups so they can turn it on at a moments notice by selecting the control group and pressing ""H"" to toggle weapons on."
wargame,3cfved,Cole7rain,3,Tue Jul 7 19:57:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Okay so put my radar AA in a group, and then I keep my radar off. Then I spot an enemy aircraft. What then?"
wargame,3cfved,AmpsterMan,11,Tue Jul 7 20:00:35 2015 UTC,"The simplest answer is to just select the control group and press H to turn your Radar AA on, and then let them fire as many missiles as they can get off before turning them back off again (don't forget to turn them back off!). Also, if the enemy plane has started to evac then at a certain point any missiles fired won't even reach the enemy plane by the time it gets out, and it's important to try and turn AA off before that happens so you don't waste ammo unnecessarily. This is especially important on expensive Radar AA like the Patriot which have a small ammo pool.  Now as you get more experienced you will find any half-decent player will often escort their bombers with SEAD. The way they do this is by pulling their SEAD out a little after their bomber so that it trails behind it. This essentially ""baits"" the enemy into turning their Radar AA on. This works especially well with SEAD planes which have MEDIUM-GOOD STEALTH. The way to counter this technique is to memorize the silhouettes of enemy SEAD planes, because you will often be able to spot enemy planes without actually identifying them. But if you click on the plane the silhouette will show up in the unit card area in the lower left corner of the screen, and from there you can determine whether or not it's a SEAD plane just by the shape.  Finally if you are not able to identify whether or not the enemy is escorting their bombers with SEAD, you can usually safely fire off a single volley of missiles and then quickly turn them back off again. As you can see there are a lot of little nuances when it comes to Radar AA micro, and I could go on but it's better I just give you a general idea and then allow you to learn the rest through experience."
wargame,3cfved,Vadersays,6,Tue Jul 7 20:17:39 2015 UTC,"Just to add to the silhouette part:  You can use the fact that people know this by flying SEAD planes that have the same silhouette as others. U.S. has the F111, Harrier, and Prowler come in both bombing and SEAD setups. This is like double the meta"

Assign your radar a number group and keep it off until you see aircraft to shoot and it is safe to do so. Then hit your numbered radar group and then the 'h' key. That will turn weapons on."

wargame,3cfved,steveraptor,2,Tue Jul 7 16:56:04 2015 UTC,Some nations don't get good IR aa and radar aa gives you much more air superiority with the additional range.   IR aa has a max range of 1.8-2.5 km  (vs planes) and radar aa is 3.5 till 4.something  km range.
wargame,3cfved,Saltysalad,2,Tue Jul 7 17:03:49 2015 UTC,"Like USSR, which pretty much requires you to use ASF's and good micro on ur radar AA network for it to be effective and to deal with annoying SEAD planes like ravens. Since Strela 10M are unreliable POS."
wargame,3cfved,frankwouter,3,Tue Jul 7 21:23:55 2015 UTC,Tung m and igla n together work pretty well as a full IR aa net. And 65 pts osa makes a nice fast aa and can be toggled for a little more firepower.   And dual mig 25 pd creates 100% CAP and air recon for only 180 pts.
wargame,3cfved,Kappa043,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:42:31 2015 UTC,"indeed, while in some games im too chocked on points to pull a tung, i usually play either around PD's or combining Buk/TOR+Shilka/bruiysa. Very effective combo, the shilka just tags the aircraft and TOR/buk finishes it off, more reliable to take down annoying targets like F-15D, nighthawks. indeed, osa speed is really nice for heli openings. IGLA-N are great for over-stretching aircraft, but are less effective versus nighthawks, F-15D and other bombers who drop payload at the ""outskirts"" of your AA net, and usually are out of range of manpads."
wargame,3cfved,steveraptor,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:55:43 2015 UTC,I like the 40 pt OSAs. 3.5km range and 50% accuracy on 150km/hr chassis. Put them far in front to absorb sead and stun enemy bombers.
wargame,3cfved,Kappa043,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:10:12 2015 UTC,65 pts has that 2.8km helicopter range that makes it decent vs longbows and other gunships. The other osa doesn't do well vs the helicopters you want to kill with your fast aa.   But the cheap osa does make hawks look really bad as a cheap spamable radar aa. But no room for it beside tung m and 65 pts osa.

On top of all that i dont think tung justifies a slot instead of the other AA options unless played on support deck. USSR strength and weakness when it comes to AA is in its radar units."

SEAD is supposed to let you do other things, you risk a $100 plane to knock out a $30 launcher because then you can (more) safely use your bomber to take out a cluster of troops or something else.  I advise several units, even if the enemy SEAD plane wipes out 2 or 3 launchers and dense system will still bring him down (planes cover a lot of ground, you don't need you AA to be close to shoot at the same target) and bring a ""profit""."

You either kill the sead plan when it turns away or you use your non radar aa to kill it and the other planes that follow it.   I also recommend having some air superiority fighters to help kill the sead when your radar aa is offline.

The 80 pts abrams offers 17 armor for a little over half the price, making it much better unit to work with the m8ags (with the bonus of the limited range helping with the micro of keeping the m8ags safe).   I like to pair my m8ags with the mexas, since the mexas has a better gun and still good enough armor.

Don't throw away those transports, but line them up behind your jagers / on your flanks. You would be surprised how well those .50s tear apart Spetsnaz (hint, Spetsnaz will shred your infantry, but have Napalm Rockets, not AT rockets) As west germany, your best advantage is your balanced deck. That is to say that with the exception of IR AA, you have pleny of everything from tanks to aircraft to infantry to make a balanced deck. For this reason, I would not recommend making a specialized west german. If you are looking for mech specialty, check out landjut. For moto, check out EurocOrPs.   Don't rush for capzones, but always attack if that makes sense. Make sure you have recon and make small probing attacks with your jagers in the enemy lines. If you find a place where the enemy isn't, push to break through.   I think that W. Germany / Landjut are the best decks for new players as they have good units, the player must learn to micro their radar, and there are no Unicorn Units (Longbow, Rafale, etc. etc.) to distract you from learnign to play.   EDIT   As W. Germany, you must must must dedicate points to an excellent air superiority fighter, and make killing enemy SEAD your number one priority. The IR missiles on a Gepard, and the stinger teams (i forget their name) are your only defence against the Ka52/Mi38 combo. You must learn to micro your AA (turn radar on and off), otherwise you will die a slow an painful death to enemy air power. As the soviet union, the moment I see I am playing a W. German player, I know that as long as I bring out SEAD, I will have air superiority. Let this be the case for as little of the match as possible.

wargame,3cfel0,fatrefrigerator,3,Tue Jul 7 20:19:47 2015 UTC,"The context here is IJ vs IT, so OP is more than probably talking about South Korea or Blue Dragons. But anyway, even the Seacobra is imo a better option than a AH-1J in a general deck - just don't expect to score tank kills with it.  And if you are playing US, then Longbow is obviously your tank killer, and an AH-1S or the recon Cobra supplements it rather nicely as an infantry killer.  EDIT: I just realized that AH-1J is also the recon cobra.. stupid me. So let's start this again: If you are playing with South Korea, Blue Dragons or general deck, use the AH-1T. It is good against both infantry and tanks/vehicles.   If you are playing US or NORAD however, use Apache Longbow as your tank killer. It has AMAZING F&F ATGM's that will rip entire tank platoons apart, and most AA systems are not hard counters against it, because the Longbow outranges many of them and it can gtfo after firing its missiles. AH-1S or the recon AH-1J are cheap infantry killing platforms, in which the Longbow doesn't excel very well. Using either of them is recommended."
wargame,3cfel0,SovietPootis,3,Tue Jul 7 20:33:56 2015 UTC,I prefer a few tow 1 vs 14 rocket pods. It adds some much needed killing power vs 3/4 armor vehicles. The big rocket pods already do enough by themselves.
wargame,3cfel0,frankwouter,2,Tue Jul 7 14:49:31 2015 UTC,"It's not I, it's 1...  And personally, I don't think the TOW 1 is worth taking. Even the I-TOW is questionably useful. 20AP just doesn't kill things like it needs to, and 15AP takes multiple hits to kill even a medium tank."

Why? 55 points for inf killing and stunning vehicles isn't bad, especially if it forces the enemy to have AA present. Of course use it where you know for certain the enemy has no AA around and it works wonders vs infantry.  55 points also makes it a little more disposable than the 70 points for a TOW. Just be prepared to reload it more often than most choppers."
wargame,3cftk1,Cross88,6,Tue Jul 7 16:08:00 2015 UTC,"Airborne is a teammate deck first and foremostly. When I've seen it used successfully, you use it to claim a position early and then have a heavier teammate reinforce you, the teammate will then have a position further ahead than he would normally be able to. after this you are primarily a support asset. This can often win a game when used effectively at lesst in conquest."
wargame,3cftk1,Orcbuster32,3,Tue Jul 7 16:30:24 2015 UTC,"Since you're kinda the guru for this sort of stuff, what would you say are the most viable 'pub' game decks. I enjoy playing the odd random 10v10 but I've found certain decks just don't work well regardless of map."
wargame,3cftk1,rgq,2,Tue Jul 7 19:28:21 2015 UTC,Wouldn't know. rarely play coalition or mixed deck games.
wargame,3cftk1,Orcbuster32,2,Tue Jul 7 19:42:21 2015 UTC,"Pubbie here. You need a coalition deck without a specific specialty like airborne or mechanized. You will need good AA, good counterbattery, and good infantry. Without those essential three you have nothing. The only decks that have all three are SKA Motorized (because Uragans), PACT Motorized (because Ondava), Eurocorps Motorized (because Caesar), Eurocorps Mechanized/Armored (because M270s), and Commonwealth Mechanized/Armored (because M270s again)."
wargame,3cftk1,idealisticcynicist,6,Wed Jul 8 06:30:50 2015 UTC,"What Orcbuster32 says is absolutely true. Airborne is best used in 3v3 games and higher. Here are a few tips I picked up.  1) When playing bluefor, play an all-coilition bluefor airborne deck. Colilitions have glaring weaknesses that prevent a player from holding a defensive line by itself. In addition, super units in airborne translate into better aircraft, which for the most part are just as squishy as their non-prototype counterparts. In this case, it is better to take breath of units than get prototypes. Examples: US has an anemic support tab, Eurocorp has no wheeled transports available, etc.   Here is a deck that I have great success with: XNgbCG1gwPU7yVgE1M5waoPg3SvHQnhLZHpVuPXBMHvgtOnFdPNue1SkljLmkaSRZAMaEZqVLqUVJpMw3G7AFki6VaYkZVkl/OHyzjhhuI3Q  Redfor has it a bit harder, since they don't have any radar aa available to them and are are totally reliant on air superiority fighters to fight off bombers.  2) Early game you rush up to claim territory for your ally. Pick a defensible forward position in the middle of the map, and go after it with infantry and aa heli escorts. When you land, spread out your infantry so you don't insta-die to a single bombing run.   2) if you still have your aa helis alive after the initial push, withdraw them. You will be able to use them later. Same goes for your transport helis.  3) You need at least 4 cards of infantry in cheap wheeled transports. These are key if you want to make any type of offensive push midgame, especially against infantry fortified in cities. Use smoke from mortars to create cover for your advance (you did take a non-coilition bluefor deck, right?)   4) More than any other type of deck, you must manage your recon aggressively  and undetected to win. If you can spot their forward most ir vehicle aa with recon, you can launch an atgm or rocket pod plane at it with sead backup and get away clean. You can do something similar with a bomber against infantry aa in forests or small towns. If their ir aa is behind their tanks, kill their tanks wit planes; their ir aa isn't in range to cover for them. Two-man sniper teams are best for this. If they need to sneak through open ground covered by an opponent's recon to get to aggressive cover, use smoke and cover a huge area with it, then move the recon team into a forward position in a treeline.  5) Flanking doen't necessarily mean getting your helis into their span and sniping their CV. When making a ""big flanking attack"", bring some infantry and heli transports and try to drop some infantry along the way. Bring atgms, recon comandoes, and aa commandoes. Even if you are detected early and the opponent places aa in their spawn, you've created a safe air corridor for your planes where you can fly off the map to perform bombing runs at unusual angles, or fly in additional infantry and create another flank the enemy needs to commit resources to.   6) An airborne deck is very, very good in forest maps, where you can get maximum use out of your helicopter's mobility and long range ir aa is hindered by trees.   Hope these tips helps."

wargame,3cftk1,LeopoldStotch1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:17:23 2015 UTC,"Big flanks rely on stealth. All the enemy has to do is place a single recon unit on the flanks, and now there are SPAAGS waiting for me in their spawn."

More like a blob that has found the path of least resistance in hopes of gaining score to win by fucking up the back line.. If the enemy does standard play, does a slow game and just stacks AA then it's game over by default."
wargame,3cftk1,_CyrilFiggis_,3,Tue Jul 7 16:33:17 2015 UTC,"The only airborne deck that is worth it imho is USSR. You have enough infantry slots that you can take everything in both a Mi8T and BTR-D (meaning they won't shut you out of the game with AA), and people often underestimate the power of massed rocket attacks/massed quad pkt. On certain maps (Straight to the point, another D-day on the swamp side), having an airborne player is almost crucial to controlling the center of the map early game. The biggest thing with airborne is that you can never assume. If you don't have recon somewhere, don't go there. All initial pushes should be supported by a Ka-52 and as many Mi24v as you can afford. And the number one rule is to gtfo if you see AA and never leave your helis at the front line.   You should never be all out assaulting with an airborne deck. It simply won't work (no heavy ground forces), and you will lose a lot of points in destruction in the process. Instead, make small probing gestures all game. I had one last night that I won like 1400 - 300. I never made a major push, I simply took the chokepoint at the start of the match, and killed their airplanes while always attacking just enough that they couldn't mass an actual assault. The second part is the key. People say to play Airborne purely defensive, but in a 2v2 this will simply lose your team the match. You need to keep the enemy from building up enough forces to attack you effectively. If the enemy does start attacking, use your Konkurs infantry and Mi28 to shred apart tanks which should be stunlocked by the 8 Mi8s that carried in your infantry at the start of the match. Always split your transport helos from the initial group of two if you plan on using them again so that they are less susceptible to AA and can be positioned as such to guarantee a sideshot with their rocket pods in a defensive scenario.. And obviously, you should be SEADing as often as possible. In general I only sead when I bring out other planes, but for airborne, you can't really do much of anything if the enemy has AA, so seading (especially a w. german player) as often as possible is the best defense to an attack."

If you don't have recon supporting the Mi-24Vs the DAP will be able to fire first and get off multiple shots before the Hinds have enough time to pitch their noses up and rotate to engage the DAPs. It's one thing a lot of noobs don't realize with helicopters, their AI is as dumb as a bag of rocks. They especially have trouble orienting their (fixed, non-rotating) guns and missile pods toward their target while on the move. So while a Mi-24Vs will normally be able to beat out the DAP, a poorly microed Hind is as good as dead."

Serious answer: Grom wasn't activated till after the fall of communism in poland, the Formoza (basically navy SEALs) were formed in 1975 and kommandosi or JWK were activated in 61, these were considered to be more timeline appropriate. Also three Special forces is a bit to much when most nations only get two (maybe three nations have one commando unit its either czechoslavokia, canada and Japan)  The only nations that get 3 SF are UK (Royal Marines, SAS and SBS) and the USSR (Spetsnaz, Spetsnaz VMF/GRU), a nation like Poland doesn't need a third commando unit since it already has a VERY exception commando lineup and would be rendered redundant."

The F-16 cluster bombers are in a weird place right now, I sometimes take the 100pt F-16 as it is good value as an multirole, but the 140pt variant doesn't make much sense when you can get the CF-18 cluster bomber in NORAD with more cluster bombs."
wargame,3cef8g,Eurasian-HK,2,Tue Jul 7 07:13:55 2015 UTC,"IMO multiroles are undervalued, it makes you less vulnerable to weighted losses (ie. losign all your fighters but none of your bombers) and if you need short term specialisation (ie. right now I just need bombers) you've got that.

wargame,3cbkyk,superwashandje,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:44:33 2015 UTC,You mean the part where clicking unload would unload the troops no matter what the transport was doing. It was amazing but also game breaking.   I would buy 6 SAS in the fastest transport. Run them at town in centre. Always defeated the other team if they helo rushed and could hold long enough for motor inf to reinforce.
wargame,3cbkyk,Olliesful,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:28:38 2015 UTC,i never found it gamebreaking really. as far as i remember you had to stop the helos and then unload which then worked even before they landed. it really worked to get infantry inside towns quick. i always thought of it as the squad rappelling down :)
wargame,3cbkyk,superwashandje,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:14:36 2015 UTC,No you just had to mash the stop key then the unload key and they would instantly unload and you could fly off into the sunset.

No but seriously, helicopter AI is so, SOOOO bad that attempting an extraction is basically a death sentence for whatever infantry wants to get back into the helicopter. If I were Wargame infantry I'd be all like ""GET ME OUT OF THIS THING I'D RATHER BE BURNT BY A BURATINO THAN SIT STILL IN THIS HELICOPTER WHILE IT TAKES 12 SECONDS TO TAKE OFF AND LAND.""  There are three things that would make helicopters better in this game: combat patrols wherein you can assign a couple of Blackhawks to patrol a map edge on the look out for flanking troops, ferrying like in Supreme Commander where you could reuse the transports in their intended function, and low level (high fuel consumption?) flight which would allow special forces helicopters to actually be useful and not act as missile magnets (WHY ARE YOU NOT FLYING BELOW THE TREELINE!?).  /end rant on why helicopters suck in this game"
wargame,3cbkyk,DaBeej484,5,Mon Jul 6 18:11:20 2015 UTC,"A combat patrol dynamic would make the helos more useful than cannon fodder in most hands. That's a great idea. So optional mapping the earth. On point of deathly extraction I have to disagree. The first step for any Airborne insertion or extraction is ensuring a safe LZ. On the opener you know generally what's coming and when it will arrive if your scout ASF is doing it's job and you are mindful of chopper/mech speeds. In extracting, the ground forces need to secure the LZ from harm and sight. I can't blame 5 chopper AIs for not landing in a 100 meter clearing in the woods"

wargame,3cbkyk,Cross88,4,Mon Jul 6 17:53:41 2015 UTC,I play the helos in support and reallocation: picking up a slow atgm inf and repositioning him a quarter way across the map to snipe a 85pt t64. Microing one Mi-17 to soften up inf with rockets. The best feeling. If units are damaged get them out of the field. I see many players leave their 1-2 health 2 stack shock inf in a fight to die instead of retreating them. It boggles me.
wargame,3cbkyk,Eurasian-HK,4,Mon Jul 6 17:58:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, retreating infantry saves you money, and also preserves their veterancy!  I recycle airborne transports as well, but my infantry has to leg it a bit more before they can embark. The front line is very dangerous for helos."

Heinlein novel Starship Troopers (not the shitty films), among other sources.

I don't see a reason why you couldn't give infantry an armor value- they seem to have armor values, they're just zero.

wargame,3cav1t,Orcbuster32,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:33:11 2015 UTC,IRCC if you play less than 2 hours of the game you can return it for a refund on steam and then just buy Red Dragon instead of the franchise pack. If its any consolation I also bought the franchise pack when I first started playing but the franchise was only EE & ALB back then.

wargame,3ce2b5,TehRoot,-4,Tue Jul 7 05:42:23 2015 UTC,"Guys, stop giving so much shit to that guy. It's his game and he bought it with his money. If he wants to play with his friends on the same team that's totally fine and his decision.   Now could people in this sub please stop other people telling how to play? If you do not like 10v10s or people communicating while playing that's fine as well. It's not like you could not host your own games, yet even get a deticated 10v10 server.  Just stop giving shit to everyone with another opinion and be a decent human being in this sub. Seriously, it can not be that hard ."
wargame,3ce2b5,Commander_rEAper,2,Tue Jul 7 10:05:11 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the down votes are because he and his friends are trying to cheat the system (and other players) by appearing to be worse players than they are.    I have no problem with he and his friends playing the game their way, I have a problem with them tricking opponents into games by pretending that they aren't really a coordinated team with 80% win rate in this type of play.       People avoid these types of games because it's pretty much a guaranteed loss (Unless the opfor also has a group of friends on TS).  His stats reflect his play style and maybe he should accept that as a natural consequence.  Now if he were worried about trying to get a 1v1 game due to an 80% pubstomp win rate, then that might be worthy of providing helpful advice.    Instead OP is whining about his play style driving off opponents and trying to find ways to trick people into playing him, thus ruining the game for his opponents."
wargame,3ce2b5,lowflier,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:37:28 2015 UTC,Point given.  I am still of the opinion that stats like winrate and games played should not be able to be seen by other players.

Each of these has a warhead capable of penetrating the armor of any modern tank (when this was published, the best US tank was M-60 Patton which could be penetrated by RPG-7), booster and sustainer engines, a spin stabilizer, a turbine, a fin assembly and a tracer compound.  His are not the only rockets in the section. It is also equipped with anti-aircraft rockets with seeker heads, which enable them to distinguish hostile aircraft from friendly ones and to destroy them. In addition, the section has four 9-M-14 `Malyutka' rockets which have an automatic guidance system. All this in one infantry section.  The section's BMP-1 combat vehicle has an automatic 73mm gun and three machine guns and has sufficient fire-power, maneuverability and protection to take on any modern light tank. The section also has three radio sets, sensors for the detection of radioactivity and gas and other complex devices in addition to its ordinary infantry equipment.  At this, the lowest, level, we find not a true infantry formation but a hybrid of tank, anti-tank, SAM, chemical, sapper and other sub-units.  The infantry is the oldest of the arms of service. All the remainder originated later and were developed as additions or reinforcements to the infantry. From our examination of the infantry section we see that the modern infantry is an arm of service which, even at its lowest level, has absorbed elements of many others. The concept of the infantry, not as cannon fodder, but as the framework of the entire Armed Forces, the skeleton on which the whole of the remainder develops, has been held for a long time by Soviet generals. After the last war, all Soviet infantry officer training schools were renamed Officer Cadet Academies, and began to turn out, not run-of-the-mill platoon commanders, but commanders with a wide range of knowledge, able to organize cooperation between all arms of service in the battlefield, in order to ensure joint success.  It is for this reason that today's officers are not called either infantry or motor-rifle commanders, but all-arms commanders.

At least that's the way it seems to me."
wargame,3c4xbu,Cantankery,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:46:08 2015 UTC,"They can run of hemmt/ch53 very well considering the low rate fire. It does really change heavy tank battles, since your opponent can't safely retreat into small cover and it is a near 100% counter on all enemy cluster arty if you catch it in the first few shots (which is a pretty big deal, since your aa net is based on 0 top armor vehicles).   It requires lots of recon and a lot of training to reduce the luck factor to acceptable levels, but it has made many fights so much easier by having the opponents paranoid and not in the usual strong cover positions. And if you hit a few tungis or a t72bu, it has payed itself off instantly and severely weekend the enemy line.   Sometimes you need a m1a2, sometimes a f18c hornet and sometimes and atacms. Run all 3 and you always have enough heavy counters that can even ignore line of sight."

It's not as urgent since Red Dragon tanks got buffed, but it'd still be an interesting heavy tank choice for RD (the coalition the game is named after) since it's designed to be able to shoot Russian AT11 ATGMs and have a rate of fire of 8 rpm (whereas the type 85-III in game is only 7rpm).

The development of the M60-2000 was primarily due to thousands of M60 MBTs in service with many nations unable to afford a sufficient force of more modern main battle tanks. GDLS devised the M60-2000 upgrade, offering many features of the M1A1 Abrams to existing M60 users at a reduced cost.  The M60-2000 was a GDLS supplied conversion kit, including the gun turret and 120 mm (4.72 in) smoothbore gun of the M1A1/M1A2, to the M60. The upgrade was marketed at those M60 users with the industrial capability to convert the tanks themselves. Along with a new turret, a new diesel powerpack and the transmission system of the M1 were installed on the M60-2000, and has been tested in a standard M60 chassis.  Turkey considered upgrading their M60s to M60-2000 standard, but then decided to opt for the Israeli upgrade package Sabra (tank) instead. General Dynamics Land Systems has offered to build a prototype of its proposed M60-2000 upgrade of the M60A3 main battle tank to be evaluated by Egypt. The Egyptian Army was considering this offer until it was finally refused and replaced by a national upgrade.

With only 4 health, one missile of any type is enough to 1 shot it.  I tend to prefer a good bit of recon that I can scatter about my front lines, or some other exceptional/very good recon that I can have on the ground.  I'd recommend the Canadian exceptional optics jeep, or the Bradley M3A3 for the medium stealth TOW2s. Riflemen '90 are overpriced for what they can accomplish on their own.  I prefer to take them in the M2A2 Bradleys, as its a 35 point vehicle with an autocannon, 4 front armor, and a tow 2 launcher.   I think those are two decent options in the vehicle tab, but I usually mix it up with something different.  The M163 CS is pretty neat for forest support, as it can stunlock and tear apart enemy infantry, as well as function as a close range anti-helo unit (1575 range ain't nothing to scoff at in a forest).   The ONTOS is a bit overrated, but can be useful in larger stacks.  Also, the M728 CEV is pretty sweet if you use it right; if you are in need of assaulting a city and have a large open area, get a two stack of these babies and they basically function as a constant, accurate artillery barrage on the outskits of the city. The cobra you have in the helo section isn't awful, but it isn't spectacular either, it's kinda a jack of all trades, but master of none.  I've grown the be a fan of the 45 point Cobra, since it's cheap fire support for infantry that it doesn't hurt too badly to lose. While the F4 is my favorite napalm bomber, I think that you're better off taking the F15D Eagle, as it's 4x 1000kg bombs are absolutely devastating to pretty much anything but superheavies.  I highly recommend you take that, as even though the napalm looks impressive, the 4x 1000kg bombs on the F15D are much more versatile.     Overall, a solid deck!"

LRM is pretty useless beside stunning before an attack. Mars and caesar are better options.   Get a Crotale, am amazing fast IR aa with excellent helicopter range. Your aa is too much radar based right now and very weak vs ka52 and sead escorted planes. Consider making the Crotale your fifth card.  You need a card of superheavy tanks, Leo 2a5 is excellent. Also drop the Leo 1a4, it is really bad compared to the Leo 1a5 and the 65 pts tank you have in your deck.   Drop the hussards, they are garbage. Get either bsg in trucks for super cheap recon, snipers for super stealthy recon or French shock recon (for only 5 pts more).   Recon tigre makes the Bo redundant. Switch it for an exceptional optics vab rasit or vbl mistral (must have unit in Eurocorps).   Upgrade the m42 to a kanonenjagdpanzer for only 5 pts more. It's much better fire support.

wargame,3c4yc2,frankwouter,3,Mon Jul 6 11:08:09 2015 UTC,"No, both the pansergrenadier 90 and marder 2 are both awesome (pansergren 90 vs tanks and shock inf, marder 2 vs ifvs and spetznatz and line inf). If you want more shock inf , you will need to drop either your manpads or atgm inf. Then you can get stuff like legion 90, rima 85 or more pansergrenadier 90.   Marder 2 is one of the reasons you play Eurocorps. It is one of your super units that help your deck become better then the deck you are fighting against. Not using them is not taking full advantage of honcorps.   It sort of depends on the games you play, but pansergren 90 in marder to support the jager spam with fallskirmjager support is almost always enough, especially in a combined arms situation. Jagers are capable of being your main fighting force if you support them with some strong at shock/elite inf.   You could easily drop the mistral inf, since you already have a Crotale/vrla mistral and a card of vbl mistral."

wargame,3c4yc2,Symph0n1c,3,Mon Jul 6 11:59:50 2015 UTC,"USSR deck suggestions:  Logistics: After doing my own analysis of command tanks, I've come to the realization that one of the best deals in the game is the T-80UK. You effectively get 155 point tank, and for 45 points more, get the command functionality with it. Compare that with your current command tank, the T-72 KI, which mirrors a 45 point tank; You are paying 105 points for command!  Infantry: Pull out one of the Morskaya Pekhota '90s, put in a spetsnaz for anti-infantry combat.  Personally, I think motostrelki '90s should be in the cheapest transport you have. You have grenade launchers on BMPTs. Makes having BMP-10s kinda redundant. If you want to go with a cheap infantry in a pricy transport, consider what role the transport fills and delete the corresponding vehicle.   You probably want downvetted konurs-m in 5 point transports instead of your current faktoriyas. If something comes into atgm range you want it dead.   You also want Igla-N in 5 point transports as well.   Support: Droop  the URAL, put in the 85 or 100 point tunguskas in. If you are worried about SEAD, turn the radar off and just use their Ir missiles. If you really want URAL capabilities, put the your Igla-N Infantry in BTR-ZD Skrezhets; they have the same gun.  Recon: The Ka-62 is one of the best helis in the game. With good micro, you shut down any radar aa near it with its sead missiles. Swap out your current mi-8r with it.  You probably want a 4th card of recon. The spetsnaz vmf has excellent stealth, so you can sneak around over open ground with them. Upvet them to max out their optics and put them in mi-24Ds; the transport benefits from the upvet as well.   Vec: Drop the Norov. It only has 13 AP power, which makes it only usable against vehicles and calvery tanks. Use the points to add the spetsnaz in the recon tab.  Droop one of the Mi-24 Ps, add in the Ka-50 akula. Pair an akula with a ka-52. This pair can deal with any type of unit in the game except IR AA."

Otherwise KISS with 100 point car and the infantry in helo so you can open with more ground and transfer into inf cmnd later on.  You can get away with just an FOB and trucks to give your self more acti to work with. Inf - this is a mess. Go for a standard omnipurpose sorta composition. moto90+btr80. vdv 90 + btrd. igla-n + btr70, choice of spetz + btr80a or sappery(flame thrower, never the 5man shit squad) in btr70 or btr-t, konkurs-m for big games, for 1v1 konkurs are fine in btr70 or moto90+bmp3 upvet. Support - Tunguska-m is always a need. It's max range anti helo. Always turn the [RAD] gun off. If you go buk then use the m1. 45 point osa + tor is a nice little combo as well for small games. For arty learn how to use the buratino. Tank - t72bu, t80um or u, t64bv or bv1, t72b or b1, t80, maybe t72a. Recon - Spetz gru + btr80a or btr90 are a need. Ka52 for exceptional recon and mi2 as sentry is a nice combo too.  You can never have too much recon. Veh - asu85m or su122 are nice firesupport/fodder. bmp3 in inf are the ulti atgm platform so dump the cheap shit here. Zhalo btr is better fire support than norov when used properly. Helo - learn to use the mi-28. Plane - Mig31 is n00b bait never hit garbage. If you want ASF try to learn the mig 25PD then move into su27s. you dont need napalm here outside of 1v1. Buratino is forever napalm. For bombing there is su24m. For atgm the mig27 at 95 or about 135 are solid options."

wargame,3c4yc2,frankwouter,2,Sun Jul 5 17:15:00 2015 UTC,"Your deck is almost complete. It does make the mistake of 5 cards of planes in Norad, which is not adviceable because it gimps your support and inf tab too much.   This advice is aimed at 3 v 3 and larger destruction.  You have way too much supply for only 1 card of mortars. I would use a fob and a card of hemmt.   You should also choose 1 bomber (f15d  or nighthawk) and use the points to get a card of 70 pts chaparels (sead resistant anti helicopter). Then drop the comvat or iltis tow 2 and use the remaining points for a card of 35 pts Bradley a with riflemen 90 (awesome atgm ifv for the price).    Stinger inf and avenger is redundant. Both are horrible vs rocket pod helicopters and artillery. Replace the avenger with the wolverine (worse vs planes, better vs helicopters due to increased range).   Consider putting the pioneers in the awesome th495 ifv for only 5 pts more. It has 2 all round armor and a nice autocannon.  You command squad should also be in a bison, since the 2 armor makes it much more survivable (ap damage leaks inside after it has killed the transport) and is the same price with the same availability.  u/aeweisafemalesheep will also recommend that you take riflemen 90 in m113 as fodder, but I prefer to use the CEV as fire support to reduce the amount of fodder needed in an attack and then the inf that comes with the ifvs will be enough."

And the cev allows his seals (that could be downvetted) to get within range safely and they can do a lot of work if you heal them between fights.   Lvt7a1 marines can do most forest grinding better then a card of regular inf.   I have never had any results trowing line inf at any problem (beside well supported jager/kustjagere work). They just die withouth doing anything versus someone who knows what he is doing.   I would prefer to add a card of base can airborne to get more inf."

Norad always wants full support, recon and infantry tabs and also offers good tanks, which takes an another 3 slots. Then you always run or 2 helicopters and the vehicle tab also offers some much needed fire support. Running a 5th card of planes requires cutting into your support or somewhere else. It isn't worth loosing so much for 2 extra planes.   Pure USA has the 5 addition points for that added plane. All my coalition decks run between 2 and 4 cards of planes."

Look into the mig17's for spammy bombing.   napalm mig29 doesn't really seem worth it outside of maybe a 1v1. t55 merdia is very playable. base czmoto might be worth a spam.  Scandi: trade out the logi copter, get another tank in there. There is a nice spammy leo, but overall you need the strv103 to play the role of defensive firesupport.  You could probably play 4card tank by trading the fennic 20mm too.  Here you could definitely try flamers or eryx + auto cannon or get danish riflespam in m113a3.   The centurion cmnd is super playable.    RD: Chinese cmnd tank is super solid. For inf I would do something different. If NK spec forces or marines then btr80a. NK reservists. Base LJ for city fights. Neva for support. Upvet F-7b plane for anti longbow. J-7H as SEAD or anti inf. This is also the only faction that lets me upvet MANPADS due to quantity. t62d might be worth your time if doing 1v1s.  Norad: i'd pop that cmnd into a grizzly/bison. The inf looks totally redundant. Here is one of the few times where you could helo open for a grab and make it work with BH+LR90+DAP. PIVADS would help with all-in helo. I can see hawk use for a 1v1 but for a 2v2 it would just become redundant. Corsair and Wild Weasel could help a lot. The 5th plane seems to be killing utility though."

Old: http://i.imgur.com/92mVtOW.jpg New: http://i.imgur.com/q5n4M9f.jpg  General thoughts:  I desperately needed more CV's so I had to ditch the tank CV and replaced with a car cv. If the mobility turns out to be an issue then I'll swap the bus cv to an 110pt variant.  Infantry tab got some hefty changes. Didn't have positive results with Gurkhas '90 so I needed something else. I learned the secret of Canadian Airborne and its magical C2A1. Deals only a tenth less damage than MG3 and 4 times more suppression? YES PLEASE!   I also needed more infantry so I removed Mistral and added FSK. It's a ghetto FSJ '90 but it's still a force to be reckoned with. Also, changed Chu-Mat to RBS 56.  Added Mistral truck to support tab because I removed the infantry variant.  Removed one Kyu-Maru Shiki. 4 cards of superheavies was simply just too much. Leo 1A5 would possibly be a nice unit but I don't think that I have the points.  Removed Vab Rasit, added Panserbil and Kiowa instead. Panserbil has proven its worthiness, and Kiowa is a poor man's Longbow. I consider swapping it for another exceptional recon heli. I also swappped Pathfinders and Jaegere, because they have C2A1. Should be a good synergy with SAS.  Removed CEV, added Ontos. It's just superb in forest fights. Ontos is a hard counter against BTR 90&Spetsnaz teams. I am very impressed. The only thing that causes me nuisance are 0 aim time rocket launchers. Ontos eats almost anything else for breakfast.  No ASF's in this deck. Instead of that I swapped Prowler to Sea Harrier. It has superior SEAD missiles (70 accuracy instead of 60) and it comes with a pair of IR missiles as a nice bonus. I tried changing peace pheasant as a cheap ATGM platform. I am not impressed on its performance, it just fails to kill its targets even tho it has 4 missiles. Maybe I'll bring the Hornet back."

The tank doesn't have enough armor to really duke it out with anything at all and if it gets pannicked it's good as dead anyway For SEAD look at the puff. 70 points gets you 700 less range and 10 less ecm but slightly more utility on the a2a gun. Take a look at the F-1 and use them in pairs to take down big things. The peace pheasant is second to the F-1 when using BD. Again, tam sam.

At least on paper it really sounds a good deal - gevaermenn/FSK/Seals dishes out the extra damage while C2A1 keeps them stunned. But then again I'm a Sergeant Scrub so I don't know titties. Also, Canadian Airborne do get the Carl Gustav. 2 frontal armor on XA-180 is nice though.  50 point howitzers have like 30 second aim time, I don't like them.  You are probably right about the flame tank, I should probably change it to M113.  I totally forgot about the existence of Puff. Will change that.  F-111C has been a mixed bag tbh. Maybe I'll try the F-1 because it is definitely a nice unit.  Already swapped the mistral trucks with tan sam.  And pathfinders are for openers, two squads of SAS and a gazelle or maybe two of 'em.

If you're looking to score an AT kill in the back then some sort of jager seems like the way to go. Otherwise they seem like the choice to throw into a city for the elite bonus + carbine+lmg for something that will wreck no matter what in urban. I was under the impression you might be trying to use can AB like one might try to use pg90, like an omni shock. You have the right idea for them, i don't think they hold up as well as PF would for urban combat though so personally unless moto I wouldn't use them, but that's me.     Overall I'd worry a bit about playing forests. Personally I've never had good luck with eryx AP inf squads for forests. This is where gurkha90, smawlvtpa1 or stormer+5 pointer would come in as an okay solution to aid other things. But hey, if it works then don't fix it.     When you have something that works well for you then do come back and share with others. Show replays and all that jazz if you can. It might help some folks down the line and provide good entertainment."

Igla should be igla-n. moto90 in bmp3 are a nice too. Support - the arty you have is redundant. The howitzer there is okay for 1v1/2v2 for area of denial. Try out the buratino or smerch for arty. For AA get tunguska-m, it's your max range anti air solution.  Tank - T64bv/bv1 instead of obr87 and t72b instead of t64b. Take points from logi and veh and put them into a t80 and t80um card to fill out tank nicely. Don't want to play 5 card tank? drop the 64bv or t72b.  Recon - you might want an mi2. Experiment with things like sniper teams, exceptional ground recce and whatever floats your boat. Gotta learn that recon. veh - drop the konkurs. Flame tank is always nice for small games.  Su-122 and asu85m are worth a look. helo- you can drop the p and be fine. Mi-28's are solid alternative to akula. plane - I would upvet the PD.

Otherwise german mortars are good. Roland2 is junk. You want roland 3 if you're gonna use those. Tank - 2a5 and leceric. Leo2a4 are so/so. Other tanks to look at are leo1a5 and leo2a1 are sweet.

wargame,3c4yc2,Itcausesproblems,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:08:38 2015 UTC,I'll jump in. Here is my Soviet Battlegroup. I'm trying to incorporate the strong aspects of my Soviet Armored deck so I have a more well rounded force.  Lately I've started fighting very offensively with the Armored deck. Pushing across open ground and bridges with good success. Towns slow me down; forests not so much. So far I've been able to take and hold bridge heads in the last 9/10 games. Pushing deeper and defending against a mass helispam counter proves costly though. By going with the general deck I'm more effective in towns and AA is stronger but my armor doesn't seem to be nearly as effective. The major difference being the armored deck carries all elite veterancy tanks vs. trained or hardened tanks.  I put red marks through the cards I've not been utilizing.     I'm wondering: Is elite veterancy really that effective?
wargame,3c4yc2,Kappa043,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:40:19 2015 UTC,"Veterancy's worth depends very heavily on what type of unit it is. For planes it makes a big difference; for infantry,  not so much."

Unless playing 4v4 you probably dont need the supply helo. inf - PEKHOTA 90, i can only see that as useful in 1v1. Standard composition is like igla-n + btr-70, vdv90 + btr-d, moto90+btr80, sapery+btr-t or btr 70 else spetz + btr80a/btr90 and if you want atgm apc then moto90+bmp3 is solid else konkurs-m+ whatever transport. support - if you trade out the supply helo from logi you can get buk m1 in there and be fine. Tank - t72bu, t80um or u, t64bv or bv1, t72b or b1, t80, maybe t72a. Recon - Spetz gru + btr80a or btr90 are a need. Ka52 for exceptional recon and mi2 as sentry is a nice combo too.  5 man recon squads are not cost effective. veh - standard stuff here, you can move stuff around here when you need more tank or if you have redundancy (like trade bmpt if you have btr-t, whatever) helo - akula and mi-28, pick one (i'd say go upvet 28) plane - If you want ASF try to learn the mig 25PD then move into su27s.  For bombing there is su24m. For atgm the mig27 at 95 or about 135 are solid options.  I wouldn't play armored unless you're with a team and playing a map that actually allows armored to do something (4v4 floods playing mid for example)"
wargame,3c4yc2,steveraptor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:06:53 2015 UTC,"Allright lets start:  LOG: Fine, MI-26 works as long as u guard it with your life. If u find urself losing them, switch to the MI-6.  INF: upgrade ur IGLA to IGLA-N and put themin BTR-70, they need to arrive ASAP to the front lines, also one card is enough, downvet them. spetz gives u the option to use the awesome BTR-80A Or 90, use that option. VDV 90 are a must for dealing with armor and in general city and forest warfare. Consider replacing one morskaya with Motorstrelki 90 for cheap infantry to go in the front or garrison towns, they can go either with MBT-LV if u want to use them passively, or in BMP-3 or BMP-1D for offensive pushes. Consider putting an ATGM team, either konkurs-M or Gornostrelki 90.  SUPPORT: You lack cheap AA which is going to hinder you greatly, keep one card of Tung M downvetted, put a BUK-M1 or TOR for long range AA duty, and use the 5th slot to put a cheap AA, either strela 10Ms, or Shilka/Briyusha. the 65 points OSA is also great to counter heli openings.  TANK: the goal is usually to divide tanks into 3-4 roles depends on how many slots u want to use. Cheap workhorses, mid-game tanks, heavy tanks and super heavies. the 65 points should fill the cheap workhorse, and T-62MV is a bad choice, get the T-80 instead. T-64BM is a great tank for mid-game (i prefer it over the T-72B), so good choice here. replace the T-72B obv 1989 with the T-80U, a much better platform for just 5 points, T-64BV/BV1 are both great tanks to consider. Replace the T-80B with T-72BU as your spearhead superheavy.  RECON: Put the GRU in BTR-90, and you should get a 4th recon unit, i recommend BRDM-3 if ur the offensive player, or BRDM-2 for cheap recon to scatter around the map.  VEH: 2 vehicles are enough, BMP-T is great, i suggest removing the Afganski, it doesn't really hit anything and just eats at its ammo with little impact (ground combat). SU-122 is great, consider also the 30 point BTR Zhalo. BRDM-3 with 2x Zhalos is a very strong opening.  HELO: Pick either MI-28 or KA-50, no point picking both, they fulfill the same role.  PLANE: SU-24 SEAD is fine, but i prefer the MIG-25BM. both YAK bombers are trash, replace them with the SU-24M. SU-25 is a very situational plane for an ATGM role, you want your ATGM plane to shoots its missiles, kill the target, and evac ASAP, the base MIG-27 at veteran level does this job perfectly. you are then left with a choice for ASF. Replace the MIG-29 for this slot, i suggest 2x MIG-25PD at elite, or SU-27S."
wargame,3c4yc2,HolyAndOblivious,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:06:06 2015 UTC,"regarding your armored deck : I dont like konkurs squads much. Specially because most of your tanks have ATGMs. Swap them for hardened spamostrelskis in 5pt transports. You should get rid of the bmp1 and get a bmp3 instead. You get more atgms this way. Also the t62MV2 sucks as a tank BUT, it is an awesome ATGM vehicle when taken at ELITE veterancy. I find your lack of t72s or t72m disturbing. They are the best infantry support tank. Their 4 HE gives the enemy a hard time and they should be used with bmp1d in forests. You will shit on infantry this way. I would swap one of the tungs for a TOR and the Pion for a strela or a buk, depending on your playstyle. You also need more recce. The high end t72 line sucks monkey dick except for the BU. Go for Elite ATGM carrying t80/t64s and take base t80s at veteran. 9rpm autoloaders will shit on anything. Bluefor tanks fire very slowly when panicked. Yours still fire fast but they won't hit shit. That's why you use numbers in order to score more hits.  The strategy and tactics are quite simple : Avoid fighting in cities. Surround them first, cut their resupply route and then take it. Forests need a lot of recce but motos in bmp1d, bmpts and base 72s should make city fighting a piece of cake. You should always have RECCE spoting for concentrations of atgms and tanks. Advance en masse across open ground and force the enemy to react. Always cover your attacks with a very dense AA network and always have a very dense reccon net covering everything. If you spot a superheavy, dont be afraid to trade units. You have more superheavies than the enemy. That will put anyone in a pickle."

For 1v1 or 2v2 it can work fine.    logi - have a cheap cmnd to start with, they have cheap 10 point transports and the river crossing cmnd car is fine too. You probably dont need the helo Inf - NK reservists allow you to constantly push, probe and be an asshole by filling towns with them. They are the best recon by fire in the game. I'd work in a unit that has BTR-80a into the mix since it has good frontal armor AND 150 speed. For city i like base LJ. Support - I'd take the pongae2 just for the range.  koksan aren't really worth it. 30 shilka is a great little unit. Tank - that's fine recon - type63 can be great for support fire and forest area play. If you take the 1992 do upvet it. veh - fine, dont forget flame tank though. helo - 60 point hind is amazing. plane - RD kinda shines here. j-7h for anti inf and seading IR,  F-7b upvet for anti helo or swarming things, q5d F&F's retreating things.

You current deck is going to fall hard pretty much in any map except wanson harbor.  LOG: Fine, nothing much to add.  INF: 2 cards of komandossi is ok in big urban warfare maps, but remember that they carry a very weak RPG, and they wont be able to protect themselves and their fellow formoza from tanks like MBT-70/Keilers and any 15 armor+ tanks, which are very common. SPADO are your only infantry that can respond to those threats in forest warfare and urban combat, i suggest putting KONKURS for maps with open terrain like Valley. PIECHOTA are line infantry that doesn't accomplish much, i highly recommend to replace them with the flamethrowers Saperzy, the only shock flame infantry in the game. This gives u a nice combo with SPADO in low-income games for cheap.  SUPPORT: looks fine, though i prefer the armored NEWA, pretty much immune to arty.  TANK: Your price curve on ur tanks is going to be a big problem in resource intense games. I highly recommend replacing one card of T-72S with the 50 points merdias, these are excellent infantry support tanks and great for pushes. I personally prefer the WILK M2 more then the T-72S, 10 points cheaper, same AP on the main gun, better accuracy and better RPM.  RECON: mi-2RO isn't worth it (60 points for a sentry is too much) and can die to 1 missile, replace it with the-very-imporant SALAMANDRA ATGM, our poor man's longbow, one of the few units in a polish deck that can deal with heavy tanks and spot for itself. T-55 recon are ok, but i like to go  with ZWAIDos, excellent shock 10 man recon in a 5 man trucks, great for opening in urban combat and works well with SPADOs and flamers openings.

The Komandosi worked fine for me in the close range forest, so I'll keep the 2 cards. A 4 stack wrecks anything it touches. What's your feeling in the Grom? So far they don't seem to hit anything or kill anything to me, I might switch them for the konkurs so I can keep the 2 cards of sf. Spado like you said for anti tank. I'll switch back to the saperzy instead of the line fodder, was just using it for the ifv. I took the wheeled newa for the speed. For the tanks, I typically play 3v3 and 4v4, with medium income or higher so I typically don't run into money problems. However, I'll probably switch one to the base Merida like you said for fire support since the bmp will be gone. I'll definitely switch out the recon heli for the salamandra, didn't even notice it!

That's why I prefer the TOR. It usually gets at least two missiles off in every engagement, which is a whopping 14 HE, and has a high chance to it. And don't forget the OSA, which is cheaper and faster-moving, as well as amphibious. It's good for advancing with or just behind your troops."

So in some cases it is better to pull your units away from the edges. Bait the tanks to come in so that the fight is at close range. Even better, move infantry units to flank and get side shots.   This is the difference between ATGM infantry, with very long range, and those with shorter range anti tank weapons.

Now lets go a little bit more in depth, all primary weapons in game will do the same amount of DPS. So the Rifleman 90's M16 will do the same amount of DPS as a Motostrelki's AK. However, training adds a multiplicative effect to DPS. So the AKs on a squad of Navy SEALs will do nearly double the amount of DPS as the AKs on a squad of Motostrelki? Makes sense? No? Well it's just going to get more complicated from here on out.  As opposed to primary weapons, MGs are were things start to vary. Some MGs will be utter crap as Eugene has handicapped the line infantry of some of the more stronger nations (like the US and USSR) because of balance. Realistically, these countries would have the some of the most experienced and seasoned line infantry of any military in the World due to the numerous wars and deployments these countries burden their troops with, but, because this is a game not a simulator, people need reasons to a country like Poland or Norway into a deck. What these minors lack in hardware they typically make up for in infantry. Now back to the MGs. When it comes to BLUFOR MGs, the I MG3, the regular old MG3, and the C2A1 are the best MGs BLUFOR has available. So this heavily favors Scandinavian shock/line infantry, all German infantry, and Canadian shock/elite infantry. As for REDFOR, the good MGs are the RPKs (including foreign-made copies), the NK Type 73, and the LMG. So, in general, this heavily favors most REDFOR elite infantry, but heavily disadvantages most REDFOR line infantry (aside from Bochongsus)."

AT-4, SMAW, Dragon II, and Carl Gustav are what you want in the US inventory. The LAW isn't worth a plugged nickel, even at point-blank range. It can't even destroy most transport vehicles. You also need to be sure to put your infantrymen in city blocks and forests instead of out in the open. Tanks will outrange your AT weapons, and their thick frontal armor will take multiple hits to penetrate.

Nearly every competitive deck in the game has a small list of units that you need to take to have an edge over your opponent, and has a set of weaknesses that people familiar with the game can exploit. Say you use a spy plane against a US player, and you see their deck is full of super units like longbows, m1a2s, m2a3s, patriots, etc. This is what you should have expected in the first place. If what you see is a deck with suboptimal unit choices, then you wouldn't have needed the spy plane anyway since you would win anyway based on equal skill."

wargame,3c2252,haydentheking,11,Sat Jul 4 01:11:02 2015 UTC,"Combat is a mix of Total War and C&C.  You place a number of units on the map to start, earn Command Points from controlling sectors of the map, and use those points to call in reinforcements during the fight.  Alternatively, the objective is to control the sectors and each team has a fixed income to use for reinforcements.  It depends on the game mode.  There is no open-ended campaign like in Total War.  There is no base building, but you need to call in special units to control a sector and gain points from it.  Infantry units are squads, rather than individual soldiers.  Squads come in a variety of specialties and sizes, from 15-man squads of marines, to 5-man anti-tank teams, to 2-man sniper teams.  Vehicles and squads are purchased individually, but can be combined into groups of up to 4.  Helicopters can only be solo or grouped into pairs.  Infantry arrives at the reinforcement point in transports, which stay on the map.  Transports vary from cargo trucks, to amphibious APCs, to heavy IFVs, to a whole array of helicopters.  Units are generally fairly realistic, though a number of units and nations had to be modified for balance purposes.  There are 17 nations represented in the game, after all.  In WG:EE, you have several story campaigns where the maps are given to you in succession like in C&C campaigns.  In WG:ALB and WG:RD, the campaigns work more like Total War, but on a limited scale.  I recommend watching videos by VulcanHDGaming on youtube for good gameplay demonstrations with commentary.  Unlike most gameplay videos, his are replays that he comments on, rather than narrating a game he is actively playing.  This is a 20 minute video in which he comments on a replay of a 3v3 online match on one of the smaller maps.  .  The 3 games in the Wargame series are different animals from one another.  European Escalation is the first.  The other two built off of EE.  EE focused on a land conflict in central Europe.  It is set in the 1970-1980 time period.  AirLand Battle focused on a conflict in and around Scandinavia.  ALB introduced planes to the game series.  It is set in 1980-1985.  The controls and interface were improved over those of EE.  Red Dragon is set in east Asia.  RD introduced ships, river craft, and the ability for amphibious vehicles to actually cross water.  It is set in 1980-1990."

But it so much fun it is all worth it. There is no base building, but there are deck elements where you select certain units for you to use in battle. You capture zones and get points that you use to purchase units throughout the game, but you start out with a good amount of points to spawn units.

I'd have to look into which exact models were used.  Also of note is that the J-22 Orao uses soviet made cannon and A-A missiles (M-60), US made iron bombs and A-G missiles, British cluster munitions (BL755) and French Matra-Durandal anti-runway munitions.  Yugoslavia was definitely an interesting nation in terms of equipment, it's neutrality during the cold war opened the door for equipment from both sides of the iron curtain (In the 1950-60's the main fighter aircraft for the Yugoslav Air Force was the F-86 Sabre), if it were possible I'd put Yugoslavia into the ""flip-flopping"" side, able to fight with Blufor or Redfor, and if you think that's unusual you have to remember that Yugoslavia had it's split from the Soviet Union back in 1948. which led to it having a unique status, it was expected by both sides to stay neutral in an eventual ""European Escalation"" and could most likely count on help from the other side in the event of an invasion.

I'd give US American Airborne (101st Airborne) and leave Rangers as recon. Give the airborne pretty much the same load out as the Rangers (CAR15/M4 carbines, CGM2/3, M60/M240 '75 and '90 respectively). I'm not sure how Light Riflemen would fit in as I think they're supposed to portray US airborne units? Either way having a good 25 or shock infantry decent transports (V-150/Humvee/UH-60/UH-1H) would solve a lot of US infantry woes.   Delta could also use some love but if you know their limitations and take advantage of their cheap price they can be good.   As it is NORAD fills the U.S. gaps quite nicely. Although it'd be nice to have a good all American deck without having to borrow Canada's infantry."
wargame,3bxcfi,Sanguinary_Guard,2,Fri Jul 3 02:52:30 2015 UTC,"Light Rifleman are not airborne per say. In real life they are a spearhead. Rangers, although having major airborne elements, isn't a dedicated Airborne unit, If I remember correctly."
wargame,3bxcfi,LengthyWarfare,2,Fri Jul 3 02:58:09 2015 UTC,"I know Light Riflemen aren't strictly airborne irl, I just wasn't sure how Eugen was representing these units in game. As far as Light Riflemen in game I guess they are meant to represent some of the light infantry divisions the U.S. has (10th Mountain comes to mind) and not their actual dedicated air assault divisions (82nd/101st). Completely leaving out US airborne seems like a pretty big gap since the U.S. uses a lot of airborne operations. Not to mention the fame they've gathered since their introduction around WW2 (101st is one of the most decorated units in service).   And you're correct about Rangers. Rangers are meant to be ""elite, rapidly deployable light infantry"". So while technically not  strictly Airborne, the ""rapidly deployable"" pushes them heavily towards that."
wargame,3bxcfi,Sanguinary_Guard,3,Fri Jul 3 03:18:27 2015 UTC,I think the 82nd is an Airborne division while the 101st is air assault now. Sorry I interpreted your comment wrong. I think Eugene needs to add actual airborne units  that jump from C130s and shit.
wargame,3bxcfi,LengthyWarfare,3,Fri Jul 3 04:07:59 2015 UTC,"You're right. The 101st are air assault while the 82nd are still airborne. However, C-130s would be a pretty bad asset in the game to be honest. For one, they are strategic cargo planes. In a wargame scenario, they would instantly die from enemy ASFs or AA. It would be even harder to use than using a supply helicopter on the front lines. However, the price tag would be horrific if it was lost as they can carry 64 airborne troops. If the price for U.S. shock inf was 20-25 pts, then you would lose 120-150 pts in the cargo alone from a couple of AA missiles.  On the other hand, I would like to have the ""para"" deck theme still instead of the weird combo of air assault and para that is the ""airborne"" theme."
wargame,3bxcfi,842wolves,2,Fri Jul 3 04:46:11 2015 UTC,"I think the idea that you could drop troops very quickly into forward positions at the beginning of a match is a good idea. You know, have 1 available under the infantry or air section in a C17 or something that is a little bulkier and harder to shoot down than a fighter or bomber for 150 points and it drops 2 30 man squads or something or 6 10 man teams."
wargame,3bxcfi,LengthyWarfare,2,Fri Jul 3 04:52:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""spearhead"". There's really no such thing in the US army. 11Bs are 11Bs. Light Rifleman was a just label for Eugen to give America 10 man ATGM Dragon teams when everyone wanted TOW infantry. At least, that's how it was in ALB. I think the term ""light rifleman"" describes the role they're supposed to fill in Wargame and not something actually based off of real life.  Also, Rangers are all airborne qualified. You need to complete OSUT + Airborne school to get an 18x contract. Rangers are SF units that are meant to be capable of doing any job the Army throws at them. So they need to have airborne training before they become a Ranger. Whether or not Rangers are an airborne unit is a bit of a superfluous argument. Ranger recruits don't have to be from an airborne unit or even have to be an 11B (though most Rangers were) to further complicate things.  I still find it hilarious Eugene considers Rangers to have the same level of training and experience as some dumb fucking marines fresh out of boot camp. Top Kek"

There are mechanized units and then there are airborne units, but you'll find plenty of 11Bs who are in cav units as 11Bs with Ranger tabs and jump wings. Cav and armored units were the spearhead into Desert Storm and OIF, and the reason for that is that they could support themselves and not have to rely on the Air Force to take everything out for them.  Also, after doing a quick Google search, ""First to Fight"" is apparently a Marine Corps thing, not Ranger. No wonder I've never heard of that because it's not even in the same branch. Of their own accord is the motto for the Rangers, but Rangers Lead The Way is probably the more famous unofficial motto for the Rangers."

Currently: on blue side, The Eurocorp/Scandi currently overrule any chance in hell for any other bluefor coalitions to compete, Mostly in terms of infantry, Airforce, Tanks and artillery. NORAD only win in terms of Helos and possibly recon  *Commonwealth: IMO Fails as a coalition due to many things, namely when it comes down to matters, your gonna be using majority british units, the lack of flamethrower infantry isn't as bothersome as some people expect. Ghurkas > anything that commonwealth out of its ass, Fusiliers have the best AT Launcher on bluefor in general and a good LMG vs the shit the US/SK/JPN have, the only thing that either ANZAC or Canada has is prob bombers and medium tanks (C2 Mexas). But in general I dislike commonwealth because why bother improving in such minor things when you already have statistically better units.  Conclusion: IMO I tend to dislike this coalition. Namely the really lack of anything good in general.  *NORAD: A really BS excuse of a coalition that I may harbor a bias grudge for since the US lacked any other specialist infantry (marines 90 are good but if you look at the shit the Scandi/EC gets you might as well quit), infantryman 90 are not good to get an M2A2 Bradley AP, while PZG get basically a light tank as fire support...Canada doesn't really offer anything new to the Table other then giving the US the Leopard C2s and Canadian rifleman are just M240 wielding Rifleman 90 before they got there AT4s.  And before someone says ""magical unicorn units""(ATACM/Patriot/M1A2/ Longbow execuse) lets think about it this way, the ATACM is only good at punishing users who make there tanks stick out like a sore thumb and its only precision, the SMERCH is a million times better IMO. Patriot? Overrated. Longbow? If you don't bring AA escorts for your tanks/Infantry, your fault and you should be punished. M1A2? Its a superheavy, most nations get it anyway, its nothing special.  Conclusion: The US deals with outdated equipment, shitty air force (yes the F-15C Eagle sucks compared to the Worlds best F-16s made in scandi and anything the Eurocorp has) it may have a better Guided bombs but that's pretty much it and possibly recon units and helicopters... Your gonna rely on basically magical unicorn units that are absurd overrated IMO...   Blue dragons: these nations really need a buff in the infantry department and tanks, currently they cant fight an infantry fight to save there lives (basically Rifleman 90 prepatch or given an M2CG pick your poison), they lack any real infantry SF (kutei 90 are good for there price) but the SK marines/Hudou-ren are pushovers against Moto-schutzens or any real redfor shocks, your heavy tanks are very limited and your cheap tanks are so shit why bother? Recon tab is very limited and currently this may seem minor but lacks a 2 man scout team. Helos are prob a redeeming factor but are currently outclassed by the US, which has many better options. Air force is just... shit... the F-15J is just shit for its price and its basically an F-15A. SK Airforce would be good if it wasn't for its absurd overspecialized F-16s  Conclusion: Theres no reason to use this when scandi can offer the same for much much much better. Lack of Shock units (only three counting recon and there basically shit), lack of recon units, no great AS fighter and a laughable SF pricing basically brings this coalition with much promise to a basically laughable levels.  IMO the current coalitions on bluefor basically are just so shitty balanced. I literally believe the small nations such as SK/Japan cant go up against the USSR in infantry battles or heck in general on the same skill level..."

With atgm planes you should aim for side shots or rear armour if you can. Then you don't need two hits. That is the whole beauty of using an atgm plane, the ability to come in from the sides at a moments notice to the enemy tank. Also if you are redfor try the Mig-27 available to the USSR. The 95pt version is a great bargain, as you get two veteran level jets (almost elite) and the gun on the Mig-27 has a better tank killing ability than the Su-25.

wargame,3buqaq,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:15:50 2015 UTC,"German cruiser Prinz Eugen:        For the World War I battleship, see SMS Prinz Eugen   Prinz Eugen (German pronunciation: [ˈpʁɪnts ɔʏˈɡeːn]) was an Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruiser, the third member of the class of five vessels. She served with the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) during World War II. The ship was laid down in April 1936, launched in August 1938, and entered service after the outbreak of war, in August 1940. She was named after Prince Eugene of Savoy, an 18th-century Austrian general.  Prinz Eugen saw action during Operation Rheinübung, an attempted breakout into the Atlantic Ocean with the battleship Bismarck in May 1941. The two ships destroyed the British battlecruiser Hood and severely damaged the battleship Prince of Wales in the Battle of Denmark Strait. Prinz Eugen was detached from Bismarck during the operation to raid Allied merchant shipping, but this was cut short due to engine troubles. After putting into occupied France and undergoing repairs, the ship participated in Operation Cerberus, a daring daylight dash through the English Channel back to Germany. In February 1942, Prinz Eugen was deployed to Norway, although her time stationed there was curtailed when she was torpedoed by the British submarine Trident days after arriving in Norwegian waters. The torpedo severely damaged the ship's stern, which necessitated repairs in Germany.  Upon returning to active service, the ship spent several months training officer cadets in the Baltic before serving as artillery support for the retreating German Army on the Eastern Front. After the German collapse in May 1945, she was surrendered to the British Royal Navy before being transferred to the US Navy as a war prize. After examining the ship in the United States, the US Navy assigned the cruiser to the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll. Having survived the atomic blasts, Prinz Eugen was towed to Kwajalein Atoll, where she ultimately capsized and sank in December 1946. The wreck remains partially visible above the water approximately two miles northwest of Bucholz Army Airfield, on the edge of Enubuj. One of her screw propellers was salvaged and is on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial in Germany.

With BLUFOR I find myself always having to rely on meatshield/sacrificial 5-pt transports. Deploy them ahead of ONTOS or Rensou. These two vehicles have really high alpha, but they are glass cannons, so something else has to absorb the first blow on their behalf. PG90 are quite good for forest, too, against BMPT, VDV90.   Against REDFOR INF I like the Wapc with grenade launcher, or to lesser extent LVPT with AGS17 40mm grenade launcher. But either of these still require 5-pt transports to meatshield.   One thing I've been trying to make work is the combo of fast mortars and strong shock/elite units like the French Commandos Marine. I've seen BoltSauce really make that combo work in his videos, but it requires a lot of micro. Basically he uses the Commandos Marine to pin enemy units down, then strike with mortars or bombs.   So basically for REDFOR: screen with Spez+VDV90, followed by BMP-T.   While for BLUFOR: screen with M113 or other cheap transport, then either ONTOS/Rensou/AGS17 40mm grenade launcher against Spetz, or PG90 against armor."

First of all, IFV's/APCs are your friend. The NM113 Autocannon APCs for 15pts do wonders against heavy spetz/formoza etc. play when paired with glorious MG3 of Stormers. If you see a lot of infantry with AT capabilities the key to winning engagements is to micro your infantry in front of the APCs/IFVs as this way the VDV/Moto 90's will engage your infantry squads while the ifv's are free to wreak havoc on them with autocannons. Also, I have found that for me, against Spetz/Li Jian/Formoza single stack infantry is optimal as it reduces the amount of squads that are stunned/panicked per shot.   If you see 4 stacks of Spetznaz or the like just send in IKV-95 (i think it was 95 its the tank destroyer thing in the VEH section) or use bombers/amos. Panserbills with their broken ROF are also not a bad idea however sometimes can be taken out by the spetz or if you spot that there aren't a lot of AT squads in the vicinity just send in glorious forest tank STRV103D(or B or C).  Finally, throw in a couple of flamer squads in there just to give you that extra morale damage/glorious stuns."

wargame,3bt5fd,Cross88,5,Thu Jul 2 16:15:36 2015 UTC,There are some games and maps where late-game helo rushes are viable. Sometimes it's absurd how little flank protection some players have.   The key to a helo rush is to bring an airborne CV of some kind so you can neutralize and then capture an enemy deployment. That's how you make the rush pay off in the long term.
wargame,3bt5fd,Jharec,3,Thu Jul 2 04:12:08 2015 UTC,"Straight up rushes for your spawn zones at the beginning of the match are easy to beat if you know how. Here is one way to do it if you're a new player getting frustrated at being helo rushed:  How to Counter a Helo Rush for Bloody Beginners  Note: This is for 1v1, but most of it is applicable to bigger games as well.  1) Have appropriate units in your deck   1 card of decent gun AA (Shilka / Strop 2 / Marksman / Gepard / Sopel / what-have-you). Not necessarily the most expensive one since you need multiple of those. 1 card of decent-range (2600+) infrared missile AA. Autocannon vehicles, transports or recon also help.   2) Start deployment   Start with 2 CVs so you don't auto-lose when you beat the rush, but lose the CV to a lucky hit. Deploy your spawn cv so it is near the road that spawns your units. Cover it with one AA gun. Leave ~100 points in the bank.  Just delay buying a non-time critical unit (a plane/additional flank defense/more inf) for a minute or so. your pushing units should be covered by ~2 AA guns / AA missiles and also have some auto cannons. just to be sure. Don't: Buy a lot of AA in the beginning without knowing a rush is coming. You'll gimp yourself if your opponent plays a standard match. Tip: If your opponent finishes deployment very fast, that is a good idicator that a rush is coming. Exchange a unit (a tank for example) for one more AA gun in this case.   3) Helo Rush spotted   Always send a (preferably cheap!) scout helo to the middle of the map. Otherwise, just follow your plan to take zones normally. (You do have a plan, don't you? ;) ) Call in additional AA guns / some missile AA. Put them in a forest line in front of your CV. Don't: Buy fighter jets. They are not cost-effective against a lot of helos. Move your ground push into the nearest forest so he loses sight. Watch as your AA advantage turns 4 times the points in helos into scrap metal.   4) Helo Rush defeated   Congratulations. Your opponent just gave you a massive ground advantage that he is unlikely to recover from. Continue by pushing your ground units as hard as possible to control zones / attack his zones. Watch for additional cheese, since this is about the only option left open to your opponent.   Note: Simply investing points into a proper helo air drop is not a helo rush, and actually a decent tactic if it is supported by advancing ground troops."

It is likely that they'll spot the poor stealth tanks/vehicles shooting your guys and allow you to kill them. Same with having a medium optics tank in your composition.  Yes, it is not effective if you have a proper scout at hand. Which not even top players manage to do at all times. But you always have some infantry at hand. And medium optics units are better at spotting stuff than poor optics units."

wargame,3bnhi4,VladTheInstaller,4,Tue Jun 30 22:55:42 2015 UTC,"They were produced in 1995 (about 200) and saw first action in 1999. So they are in the timeline.  As for their high low model, it just kinda disappeared for reasons we are unsure of. The T-90 had much better protection and integrated T-80U technologies (Since T-72BU was an upgrade from the T-72B with T-80U upgrades that's maybe where it got it's destination?). Also the T-80 performed poorly in urban combat which lead to the halt of it's production and anything based off of it.   Another reason why they abandoned the model could be because of the Gulf War where everyone realized that having high end tanks made lower end tanks seem almost useless."

wargame,3bnhi4,SmokeyUnicycle,2,Wed Jul 1 01:36:57 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I'm in no ways an expert on the matter but happened to know the topic a bit thanks this wonderful wargame. If anyone notices any mistakes please feel free to correct me.  First, I'd like to address your point about pairing the different types of tanks.  We all know that the main clash between Warsaw Pact and NATO was supposed to happen in European Theatre. The elite Soviet force that was supposed to spearhead the advance was the formation called The Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. By the end of the 80's GSFG was in the process of being reequpped with T-80 tanks (mainly T-80B\T-80BV) with some units still fielding T-64 (BVs?).   GSFG was the only force outside of the Soviet Union to field T-80s and it had no T-72s in any notable numbers. So what I am trying to say here is that there was no pairing with attempt to use less technologically advanced T-62s\T-72s as a breakthrough cannon fodder. T-72s were supplied to the Soviet units stationed on less important fronts and sold for export (T-72M and T-72S families).  Source the tank types in Russian language.  Next, I'd like to point out that T-72 vs T-80 comparison in terms of armour is not that obvious. You can read about it in detail here (sexy pics included obviously). In short, T-72B featured some interesting cavities in the front turret armour. Those cavities were filled with different types of armour that could vary from basic homogenous steel (speculated) to Abrams-like ""special"" armour (known for sure).  Moving on to answer your question. I don't know why Eugen chose T-72BU over T-80UM\T-80UE\T-80UD\T-90 obr. 1992\etc. The game takes place in the alternative universe where the USSR has not collapsed so theoretically Eugene can come with any excuse they want. From RL standpoint we can try comparing 2A46M-4 (T-80UM) vs 2A66 (T-72BU) but that won't help much in deriving tank's accuracy and stabs, while tank's AP has more to do with the APFSDS type it can operate (hello autoloader restrictions). From the armour stanpoint T-72 family has at least a mention of Relikt ERA installation possibility while the best one mentioned for T-80s is Kontakt-5, although imho Relikt could've easily been developed to be installed on T-80s if the USSR was alive. All in all, this question remains open due to events taking place in ""alternative"" universe.  P.S. Unlike what many people here claim, T-72BU\T-90 obr. 1992\T-90A are not the same tanks. More on it in Russian here."

If you take out one or two tanks move your longbow back, of course some one will counter it with a tung if you leave it near the front. What would you do if you were playing redfor?   Your longbow should always keep moving unless you are far from the front line. Don't use a 150pt helicopter in a static position, you are only asking to be sniped by arty.  The best way to use the longbow is to harass the enemy with it and then keep it in reserve for when redfor makes a armoured push."
wargame,3bllnd,Eurasian-HK,10,Tue Jun 30 05:33:03 2015 UTC,"And trust me, OP. The mere presence of a Longbow will significantly alter the behavior of your Redfor opponent. I know when I've spotted an enemy Longbow I'm much more reluctant to make armored advances."
wargame,3bllnd,Cross88,4,Tue Jun 30 11:08:03 2015 UTC,Longbow is as good a deterrent for attacks as it is repelling them
wargame,3bllnd,DatRagnar,12,Tue Jun 30 13:52:18 2015 UTC,"Shift positions. Yes the longbow is great, but is outranged by Tunguskas and vulnerable to other AA too. Someone will bring that counter, so shift the longbow to another area, maybe even to another lane. Its a helicopter, use the mobility. Keep expendable helicopters to scout. Have a Cobra or transport heli fly slightly in front of the Longbow. You are better of loosing the former. If you struggle with the Longbow you can of course take the cheaper helicopters to try and snipe high-value targets. Be mindful that you need high-AP and range ATGMs still. The Seahawk is a good cheaper alternative."
wargame,3bllnd,WG_Theo,4,Tue Jun 30 07:37:28 2015 UTC,"The seahawk is pretty bad for the price, you might as well use the hellfire kiowa or the tow 2 cobra."

The Kiwa is a viable alternative. Still 20% points more expensive, dies to one missile and is not as fast. Yes, Optics are welcome and they are alternatives. But both are viable."
wargame,3bllnd,WG_Theo,2,Tue Jun 30 18:11:28 2015 UTC,"The optics make it way better, since it saves 50 pts and a recon slot on the recon helo you need anyway. I was mostly talking about that 80 or 90 pts cobra btw.  The seahawk is simply overpriced and lacks versatility since it lacks recon or gunship capabilities.  4=6 anyway since tungusta and is a 1 shots both and strop 2 also melts both."
wargame,3bllnd,frankwouter,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:06:51 2015 UTC,"I was mostly talking about that 80 or 90 pts cobra btw.   Cobra (which is I-Tow, btw not Tow2) does not even come close for tank-hunting:   80 point Cobra : 20 AP, 60%, 2625m range 80 point Seahawk: 26 AP, 70%, 2800m   You dont necessarily need exceptional optics on the heli. Helis can just as well simply support the front line and engage targets that light up from ground recon/firing on friendlies.  Again, I am not saying that this is the one and only way it can be played. But OP was actually asking for cheaper alternatives that would not hurt as much loosing. The Seacobra is such a unit. High-range, high-AP, high-acc expendable. So is the Kiwa. Less expendable, and a recon slot, but exceptional optics."
wargame,3bllnd,WG_Theo,7,Tue Jun 30 20:44:30 2015 UTC,"First mistake is to treat the Longbow as a traditional helo recon unit, because that is not what it is, nor what it wants to be in the first place.  You bought a Longbow to give Ivan's armor force a new hole several times over by punishing them for even thinking to advance without anti-helo coverage.  While it's a great unit with a skilled person, it needs help from traditional recon and ground units to discover AA and tanks.  If you don't do this, you'll get wrecked.  When playing REDFOR, any Longbow sighting is an immediate high value to track and destroy.  Now, as a USA/NORAD player, getting discovered with a Longbow is ruining surprise. You can also reveal it as a ""show of force"" to know what they are up against. However, don't keep it within their visual range, continue to hide and shift as necessary.  If you think they spotted your Longbow, you need to be patient and hide it for a bit.  The enemy in the thick of fighting will eventually forget and that's the critical moment of glory for Longbow.  They think they can push and delay their AA push with their armor... then BOOM!  Longbow appears and wrecks face with freedom missiles.  Then you disappear again and wait for a new moment to appear.  Be patient Grasshopper and strike with great fury when the time is right.  As mentioned before, if you want to advance with Longbow, screen with cheaper helos."

wargame,3bllnd,frankwouter,3,Tue Jun 30 11:27:20 2015 UTC,"For optics ranges there should be a chart floating around. Longbow is a direct counter to t90/80um/moderna sorts of things. Used all the ammo? Then have it sit around and spot. Yes, it takes away super heavies. There aren't any substitutes, it's a unique unit because of the F&F trait. Something similar is the F-1 or NightHawk since those rounds will follow the enemy as they back pedal.    Put some air fodder in front of it. If you know where a tunguskam is then you can bomb/napalm + sead it so you can have free reign over an area for a while. If you can actually get visual on a tung you can nighthawk it too which can be super effective for screwing up someones day. Watch out for cheapie planes like mig21 and 23 since those can go in for a 1 pass kill for aprox 1/3rd the price."
wargame,3bllnd,Aeweisafemalesheep,6,Tue Jun 30 21:01:09 2015 UTC,"When it comes to super units, I never use them solo. Super heavy tanks are always supported by lighter tanks. The same sort of applies for Longbows when I use them.  When using the longbow, I like to keep air to air choppers nearby as well. On top of that, I don't rely on it for recon, it's simply too expensive to be your eyes. In order to make sure it's safe wherever I use my longbow, I'll first send out other cheaper recon as far as they can go. I'll even use force recon where I throw away units on purpose to test the enemy line. Once I find a weak point, I use my longbow to exploit it as much as possible.  Another thing about AA. You can open unit tool tips in game to check things like ranges, in case you want to be sure when engaging with the longbow. If I have an AA piece spotted, and my Longbow can outrange it, I will take it out with the Longbow. Doing things like that tend to open up more opportunities too, as you just earned more manoeuvring room for your Longbow."

wargame,3bllnd,Korochun,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:10:01 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, use it as a deterrent and a reactive force.  Let the enemy see it at the very start of the match (or soon after you call it in) and then hide it.  They will seriously consider making any kind of push through an open area as long as they think a Longbow is in the air.      I've seen it used sucessfully to pretty much obliterate the enemies opening push if they forget / don't bring enough (or the right kind) of AA.  At the same time, I've seen them get destroyed instantly trying to do the same thing to a well prepared force.  The best way to use it is to be careful and use screens as others have said (put a transport helo in front).  It is well worth the 150 pt investment as it should be primarily brought out to deal with high end (130+ pt) tanks.  One double tap with the Hellfires and it has basically paid for itself."

So these decks will be limited in areas where infantry can not perform well ie, open ground. The tanks available aren't always made for fighting other tanks but are more for fire support. Motorized focuses on mobility so tank options are limited.  Off the top of my head, RD motorized is very powerful. Theyre fast and hit hard against anything that isn't a super heavy. Also, amphibious tanks with great SA missiles work well for harassment. With motorized you should use movement to your advantage and hit weak spots in your opponents defences. You have to control the fight to be successful with motorized."
wargame,3bmvhc,gongolongo123,2,Tue Jun 30 22:35:15 2015 UTC,"Motorized decks are really nice if you fight in a lane where you will never have to fight over open ground. They maintain all the good inf and wheeled transports and the whole deck goes 150 pkh with massive autonomy.  The upvetted inf wins vs an unspec deck in an equal engagement using the veteran bonus and numerical bonus with the additional cards.   Good moto includes: NSWP, Red Drgaon, Scandi, Noway, Eurocorps, France, Commonweath, (Norad).  Mechanized is also inf focused, but retains tracked vehicles, like artillery and heavyish tanks. It also has massive fire support with all the amazing upvetted ifvs it gets.   They are best used in combination with an armored or unspec deck  where the moto/mech clears forests and cities and provides anti helicopter aa and the armored deck (with its upvetted tanks) deals with the rest.   A question though, which marine deck do you play?  I don't see how marine decks are any good, since they are either low quality (USA) or a moto/airborne hybrid without fighters (blue general marine). Most coalition marine decks also have very lacking inf beside marines.  Just use the good moto coalitions and enjoy the amazing inf power and mobility it gives.

wargame,3bh2ut,The_Ace_of_Jokers,51,Mon Jun 29 04:05:25 2015 UTC,"Okay.  Infantry training level has a huge impact on how well they fight. If you click on the infantry unit and see their card, then it will say one of the four types of training: Reserve, Regular, Shock, and Elite.  Reserves are only for spam inf.   Regular infantry are usually garbage except for two units which I'll talk about later. BUT, Reg. inf is good for holding down positions, as their AT is usually ok and then they can cut advancing infantry down. Your Jagers are Reg. infantry.  Shock is what most people use. They're good at assaulting and fighting in general. Usually armed with good main guns, AT and MG's. Your PZG's are shock, so they're pretty good at any type of fighting. Shock beats reg and is good against other shock.  Elite inf are the best infantry there is. They will usually decimate enemy units on all shapes and sizes. Your fallshchirmjager '90 are one of the best anti infantry units in the game due to their G-11 and the MG3 and the PZF 3 AT weapon.  It also depends on the weapons they have. Usually '90's variant have assault rifles, and some units get better MG's. (though not US inf because Eugen hon hon.)   The 3 types of rifle are:   Battle Rifle - Usually better for forest fighting (but they are indeed great in cities) as they usually have better stats than assault rifles except in a few areas. Almost all german inf have Battle Rifles. See ANZAC commandos for Amazing Battle rifle infantry.  Assault rifles are usually what 90s variant have. They are jack of all trades, master of none. They are average in most respects, but effective. They are usually better than battle rifles in cities.  SMG's are amazing at killing enemy infantry. Fast fire rate and short range will decimate enemy infantry in the same block (contested).  Carbines are another type that combine the best of Assault rifles and SMG's, but few units have them. FSJ '90 have them, which makes enemy squad size look like a countdown.  However, the MG is a very important weapon. The two types of regular inf that are better than most are Jagers and Diggers '90. Diggers 90 get the minimi, which give them a lot of power, so they can wreck infantry pretty well even when assaulting.  The other type is the MG3, which all german inf and some scandi inf have. The MG3 is the best MG in the game due to crazy fire rate and suppression values. 4 MG3s will stun any infantry in a few seconds, which makes the Jagers good for assaults, even though the MG is not effective in contested fighting. Howver, the PZG's and FSJ's also have them, so it's pretty much a fuckfest for your guys if number advantage is equal.  Now redfor though, has a scary unit. Well, two. Spetsnaz or Li Jian '90. This is probably the source of your infantry woes. Spetsnaz has a napalm launcher instead of an AT weapon, so they will mess up your infantry even better than an MG3 could. Squads get stunned pretty quickly, which makes it worse for your infantry. Suffice to say, if you send even FSJ '90 to kill the spetsnaz, they are going to die pretty quickly. So that is probably why your infantry is getting fucked, is the enemy is bringing in Spetsnaz. So how to counter them? Wellm you do have a few options. Either arty or bomb the fuck out of the, or more cost effective is take your 2 armor transports and drive them in there to kill them with MG3s, or, my favorite thing to do, is drive a flame tank in there and give them a taste of their medicine. But since Germany has no flame tanks, here are some alternatives:  Drive m113 in there, fuck them up.  Drop Leopard 1A5, get Kpz 70 keiler instead. It has an autocannon that makes them fairly able infantry killers.  Arty them into oblivion.  Oh, and I forgot flame infantry like sapeurs. They have flame throwers. Plus Sapeurs and Pioneers have SMGs so that adds to the damage in cities. Don't use them in forests really. So, they have flamethrowers. Use your common sense.  Wow, I just spent 30 fucking minutes on this. I'm such a huge wargame nerd. Whatever, I hope this helps!"

wargame,3bh2ut,WG_Theo,7,Mon Jun 29 15:25:43 2015 UTC,"Infantry on infantry combat is both simple and complicated at the same time. The first thing you should look at is their class which tells you their primary role. The second thing you should look at is their training. What type of training they have will determine how you should use them. Next, you look at their strength (hp). Finally, you look at how effective their secondary weapon is.   LINE INFANTRY, like the Jegars, are cheap and disposable. You put them in groups of 4 and get them close enough so that both their rifles and machine gun are firing, but not in the same city block as the enemy since they can't fire their machine gun then. At 10-15 points for 10 strength, they are your meat shields for your other infantry, and in groups of 4, they do decent damage against other infantry. Because they are cheap, you can use them like tripwires to let you know if an an enemy is trying to flank you at some location. With regular training however, they are extremely dependent on their transport for mobility.  SHOCK TROOPS are your true meat and potatoes infantry. Decent move speed, decent damage, cqc weapon. They are fast enough to micro in forests on their own, so don't be afraid to pull them back in the face of overwhelming forces. Put them in pairs and push with them. When paired up with line infantry and engineers in towns, put these in the same block as the enemy and get your line infantry and engineers in adjacent blocks. Look for high quality laws on these to blow up vehicles in forests.  COMMANDOS: Three varieties of these elite troops. Ones that come with a cqc machine gun or sniper riffle and a law, ones that come with a napalm launcher or grenade launcher and cqc machine gun, and ones that come with a law and aa missile. In general, they have the highest dps of all the infantry at range, and are the fastest type of infantry around. For the purposes of infantry on infantry combat, the commandos with napalm or grenade launchers are generally strongest, while aa commandos are weakest. I use these to back up my shock infantry in forests. Put your shock infantry up front, screening for the enemy. When your shock troops engage the enemy, you immediately bring up your commandos behind them and pummel the damaged infantry, retreating the shock troops if necessary.   ENGINEERS: These come in two varieties: 5 strength napalm launchers, and 10 point flamethrowers. It is generally agreed by the community that 10 strength flamethrowers are superior to the 5 strength napalm launchers. These are infantry killers, first and foremost. If you had to only deal with infantry, at close range, these would be the troops to send in. They auto-loose vs any armored vehicle. The flamethrowers used by these troops can stunlock an enemy for a significant amount of time. Keep in mind that the 10 strength version can't use their flamethrowers in cqc, unlike the napalm launchers.  Fire Support: 5 man teams with short range atgms / laws. Unlike any other infantry, they will use these on infantry as well as tanks. They do extremely high burst damage at range on groups of infantry, but they are very slow. they are best deployed in cities in defense. A pack of 4 infantry advancing on a town getting shot by a stack of 4 of these will wipe out 60% of them in one blast, thanks to their aoe nature."
wargame,3bh2ut,Symph0n1c,3,Mon Jun 29 05:52:38 2015 UTC,"One correction: never use groups of 4. A city block has a limited number of firing positions, usually only 2-3 squads can fire at once. Infantry should be used in pairs of squads in cities, outside cities single squads are optimal, but difficult to micro."
wargame,3bh2ut,Twisp56,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:24:45 2015 UTC,"Yup, almost always split my inf into 2 squads, maybe three on big blocks and 4 for forests. Even splitting 2 squads of 2 lets you spread them out and prevent your whole stack from getting stunned."
wargame,3bh2ut,Themantogoto,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:08:23 2015 UTC,How exactly does that work? Is it dependent on number of soldiers (so 215 man squads and 310 man squads) or each block is different?
wargame,3bh2ut,Emnel,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:21:09 2015 UTC,"Number of soldiers is only HP. Each block has diferent firing positions. For example a square block could have 4 positions, one in each corner."
wargame,3bh2ut,Twisp56,6,Thu Jul 2 11:12:19 2015 UTC,"Some general bits:   Make sure to position some infantry in the outer city blocks. Infantry (and transports) are most vulnerable in the open when trying to cross into the city. Capitalize as best as you can on this. The only exception is if the enemy has a boatload of fire support that can strafe the edge of the town. This is one reason either to have some infantry-ATGMs in the town as stand-off, or have some medium tank lurking in there (although this is more complicated). Be aware of your units strenghts and weaknesses. Jägers for example are absolutely great due to the MG.3 and their low costs, as monkey pointed out. However, note that Jägers suck in CQC (i.e. fighting in the same block). Their MG does not have a CQC tag, so they cant use it, and they use battle-rifles which get a massive debuff in CQC. You loose 90% of your firepower in CQC! Sapeurs can not kill vehicles and have troubles in forests, but they are great in cities, usually in 3 stacks. The flames linger in position, so they do considerable damage over time. However they are slightly less effective in the open, so keep them withing the city proper. Be ware that targeting is slightly dodgy. Manually order attacks, otherwise your infantry is somewhat evenly distributed throughout their block and not everyone will fire on the enemy. Only manual commands ensure they all bring their weapons to bear. Keep in mind that you do not only have infantry at your disposal. Tanks that can fire on approaches can be devastating. As can be fast-aiming artillery/mortars that fires on the approaches to the town (think about switching to the Ceasar), or especially Napalm. If they attack and you instantly light up their entire attack vector with a Mirage IIIC, they will be in big trouble."
wargame,3bh2ut,WG_Theo,2,Mon Jun 29 07:41:50 2015 UTC,"About your first point: I usually position recon infantry on the outermost ring of buildings and keep others in the inner ring. If enemy has heavy fire support, i.e. tanks, I will keep the infantry inside the town and maximize the advantage of infantry against tanks. if enemy push lacks fire support I will push my own infantry out to the outer ring and use MGs to blast incoming infantry and vehicles."
wargame,3bh2ut,pelukken,3,Mon Jun 29 20:41:50 2015 UTC,"Pretty good content here already. I think you might have fallen prey to strong fire support like light tanks, IFVs or other vehicles.  Another big point is infantry micro-management, especially morale: you want to keep your infantry from being panicked, or even worse, stunned. Fall back when you see the ! sign. In that case you won't do reasonable damage anyways so the only sensible order is 'run for your lives!'.   An interesting mechanic is that they gain veterancy after they calm down which helps for the next engagement!  In a prolonging infantry fight have supply trucks near."

If you factor in the weapon rate of fire and accuracy, you can quite easily build yourself a picture and not really have to rely on guides as much.  Some disgusting things are : 15 elites and Shock Flame throwers.  I personalyl dont rate Regulars, I would love to, but the meta is as such as this is not a competitive choice.

In most cases: sf elite inf > shock inf > regular inf. There's always going to be some exceptions and the circumstances can heavily change the results. If you really want to be sure to beat other inf with your own inf take spaznetz with napalm or sf with grenade launchers (eg Navy seals). These inf will chew up and spit out any other inf period.

wargame,3bi2f4,Todda468,18,Mon Jun 29 12:00:10 2015 UTC,"Trick is obviously to not play naval.  More seriously, you have to overwhelm CIWS. Best point / # of missiles is the Naval Prowler variant (and the German Starfighter thingy). Get as many of these as possible and call them out in a mass attack. Try to approach at a 30° angle to minimize their opportunities for retribution.  Alternatively you can try to circumvent CIWS, which does not react to ATGMs, SEAD missiles or ATAMCS.  EDIT: To find them use recon helicopters with excellent optics."

wargame,3bi2f4,frankwouter,7,Mon Jun 29 12:38:10 2015 UTC,"Pelukken's Top Ten Wargame Naval Tips:  1.- Plane Trains: group together 3-4 AShM planes with the SAME range and SAME weapon, send on a flight path perpendicular to target. when all planes have target at roughly 10 or 2 o'clock send planes on attack path to target. IF THIS WORKS... all your planes should release weapons at same time, overwhelming CIWS and naval SAMs.  2.- disable ship-borne AShM ASAP! AShM are supply intensive and and firing piecemeal at targets is a waste. toggle on AShM on ALL YOUR SHIPs when they are all in missile range and focus fire on high value targets. This does not apply to aircraft, they are basically infinite supply ammo AShM platforms.  3.- Naval Helos will struggle against larger Frigates and Destroyers, but can ripple fire missiles at Corvettes and Patrol Craft. They are excellent for recon though.  4.- Do not underestimate the power of main guns on the Kongo or Lafayette. Their range, accuracy and rate or fire mean that once your are past the missile spam, they are good for getting criticals on redfor ships. The Oto Melara on most blufor ships is highly effective when used in numbers (OHPs and Pegasus).  5.- Target supply ships, especially in a cluster! The secondary explosions can wipe out some smaller ships, causing a nice chain reaction  6.- Trick AI into sending out the fancy planes and kill with Tomcats: Bring out a Hornet or a Tornado followed by a Tomcat; this will trick out the AI into sending an expensive multirole SU27 or MiG29 multirole that can be killed by Tomcat ASF. The multirole MiG is a pain, the four AShM it carries can overwhelm CIWS.  7.- Learn ships Firing arcs!! Cham Sum Ri CIWS firing arc is rearward, OHP main gun and Harpoons cannot fire directly forward, etc. Learning CIWS, AShM and main gun firing arcs means you can position ships to maximize damage or defense. I usually position 3-4 Chams with a high-performance CIWS ship (Kongo or Hay-whatever (the Japanese frigate) and as an effective anti-missile shield with offensive punch  8.- Supply is key. Keeping your ship armed with SAMs, ammo for gun and AShM is key. Repairing damage is secondary due to the amount of hit points but should not be disregarded. Naval SAMs are dual-role, extremely useful for anti-missile and anti-air warfare.  9.- Look for critial indicators! Weapons Down or Reboots are key to getting free hits with a your AShM Plane Train  10.- Dont play naval... :)"
wargame,3bi2f4,pelukken,4,Mon Jun 29 19:17:21 2015 UTC,"He who navies first loses in Wargame.  Wait for the enemy to spawn their navy, then decide:   Does this matter?  Can I win the game with this navy here?  Most of the time the answer is ""this navy is irrelevant and I can ignore it."" Do I have the points and tools to defeat this navy and get ahead on points.  If you designed your deck correctly, this should be the case, but sometimes it's not. Can I spawn a navy of my own on the other side of the map instead, effectively blanking what they spawned? If I try to defeat the navy, can they counter that effectively?  As in, if you use planes or helis, are they staying close to air spawn and islands with anti-air?  Some maps (Gunboat diplomacy) Counter-Counter is MUCH stronger than Counter.   As for general tactics, the biggest thing you need to get down is timing anti-ship missiles so they all hit at once.  The best time to hit a ship is when it says ""Radar Down"" or ""Weapon system reboot"", as you basically get free shots when this is the case.  Coordinate timing of anti-ship planes will require some practice, but isn't hard to master.  While you can use the toggle weapons feature, it's better to just have faster longer range planes make a small loop, so they all just arrive at the same time.  If they're near your air-spawn, be sure to take the time to go out sideways then come back in.  Use artillery to panic the ships.  If you have unlimited ammo, you can eventually kill any fleet with just artillery.  Artillery will also force the ships to move, which can be useful for getting them off a zone, or push them towards your fleet.  Some Redfor ships are highly vulnerable to Hornets, but some are actually incredible anti-air platforms such as the Nanushka, and you're unlikely to trade fairly with them unless you're three or four times their points in Anti-ship planes.  The Udaloy and the Sov are also very strong against planes, and should be approached with 2 or 3 anti-ship planes at once.  If you don't have enough, coordinate with your team.  As a rule of thumb, if your missiles don't outrange their missiles, don't send your plane into a suicide mission.  IN a pinch the anti-radar planes can be used to finish off ships.  They deal low damage, but they have good range and are difficult to shoot down.  Use Helicopters to scout, they have better recon.  In mass they can deal damage against some types of ships, but mostly they should be used for their cheap exceptional sea optics.  They're vulnerable to the anti-air ships though, or from planes, and should be babysat.  If you have a ton of resources available, this might be a better option than even anti-ship artillery pieces.  Practice against the computer is actually helpful.  Most of the maps have naval battles where you are severely outnumbered.  Each of these battles is winnable with minimal or no losses.  Some require a lot of ingenuity to figure out how to do that: Leaning on la fayette stealth, scouting with helicopters to find targets for anti-ship planes, and so forth.  Unlike most anti-computer stuff, this practice translates directly against players.  Computers even spawn mig-31s right on top of your AntiSU if you aren't paying attention, just like a human would."

If you're about to lose your naval spawn zone, you can open up the Summon Units tab to naval, and as long as it's open, you will get the option to spawn those units, even if you lose the zone.  You can use tanks and anti-tank missiles against coasters, but they're low in effectiveness."

NATO, historically had an incredible amount of aircraft at their disposal- thanks American CVNs. The soviets had aircraft yes, and they also had incredible ASM. With all that said, if you're gonna use NATO navy...don't. Just swarm to Soviet ships with the plethora of ASM planes available to you. If you're playing as Soviets....you better make sure you have close air patrol flying near you and recon....AND!!!!! MOST IMPORTANTLY PLAYING THE SOVIETS IS! Only get ships with Moskits. If you burst fire these boys with three or more ships at once nothing will stop them. You will slowly tear the NATO navy to threads. Example: One Sovremennyy (optional) and 6 Tarantul. Or just the Tarantul themselves. line these boys up (Moskits out range Harpoon :) and are leagues better). Highlight the all as they are in a line facing the NATO fleet. Hot key weapons off to on. Target your first NATO ships. Hot key weapons off/on- next ship. Rinse and repeat. Keep them supplied and for the love of the Motherland make sure you have close air patrol.   NOTE: Playing either side. Use smoke and cover the ships you want to target. Their CIWS will work but their missiles will be blind and will not fire at you. Second, ATACMS if the Soviet fleet is standing still. Use SEAD aircraft together with ASM aircraft, out range any AA. OR...lead them on and set a trap using 4 ground based ASM launchers...that works very well. The problem I see is the Harpoons suck and are not effective like the Soviet Moskits are. I'd stick to NATO air train of pain. If you're playing NATO and you MUST have a surface fleet...Lafayette and a Kongo....if there was ever a biased...it's with the Lafayette...thing is incredible and apparently has a cloaking shield on it haha.

Get your ships into a formation that maximizes their overlapping CIWS, with supply ships close enough to replentish missiles.   If you have any fighters, have them patrol constantly to help intercept enemy ASM planes. The best CIWS in the world won't protect you from a plane spam attack. Only send out your own ASM planes against targets that are already fighting your fleet. Try to pick off stragglers that aren't protected by other nearby ships.   Allow the enemy to come to you. The computer, from my experience, will usually send in their ships one at a time, without supply ships. That's your best opportunity to avoid being overwhelmed."

Fly your air-plane-pain-trainTM so that the targeted boat or small fleet is perpendicular to your air-plane-pain-trainTM and at that point begin the attack so that your air-plane-pain-trainTM becomes an anti-ship firing line. This makes it so your missiles impact almost simultaneously allowing a much easier overwhelming of any CIWS ball as you get to watch enemy ships blow up one by one instead of your missiles."

When pegasus is in range, have them point away, tell them to attack, and immediately disable weapons. They'll turn to attack, but won't attack. When all the Pegasus are successfully turned, you can reenable Weapons and they will always shoot a coordinated volley. This volley can break through most nets. Be sure to keep them well supplied"

After that, I would re-adjust as needed to either keep pushing or hold the line. Also a question on DAP usage, should I be ""attack moving"" them to enemy choppers or ""quick moving"" them to enemy choppers? LOG - Should I keep the M35 or get a command tank (I usually play 4v4 or 10v10 destruction).  INF - Should have have airborne '90s in Land transports as well or keep them in helis? Also, should I keep the stingers in the M113(with roadspeed of 110km/hr) or have them in the 150km/hr transport. I don't want them to outrun the Canadian Mech troops.  REC: Should I exchange the Recce for something that I can scatter around more (e.g. Rangers)? HELI: should I keep the 65 pt cobra or get the one 80pt one with more ATGM? I usually use the Cobras for its rockets against soft skin transports.  Air: Should I trade the F-117 for a F-111 (2 vs 1 availability + cheaper)? Since most of my F-117 are usually one-way missions. NAV: Is this the correct BLUEFOR strategy for anti-ship work? Just spam AShM from aircrafts?

wargame,3bbp8g,WG_Theo,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:05:25 2015 UTC,"NORAD Playstyle: Basically, I like to have my Seals and Canadian Airborne with DAP support capture a contested zone with land reinforcement of COMVAT and Chap.   Standard Heli Play:   DAPs should not attack-move, but simply move. Do not even stop them short of the target unless you know there is no enemy heli. The reason is that when they stop they have a nose-up orientation which prevents them from firing, something they can do on the move. You should get infantry faster helicopters for the opening. the point after all is to be extremely fast. The Blackhawk is the fastest, especially if you include landing time. Navy Seals do not make a good heli-opener. They cant repel vehicles due to no RPG, so they are not effective at holding a town. They are good at fighting infantry, but if infantry is in the town already, you have likely failed. I would insert Rangers or Light Riflemen '90, due to their all-round power and access to Blackhawk. Canadian Airborne would usually be used to reinforce the landing zone, as they have access to wheeled transports.  I would usually throw a recon heli in to get an early impression of what's going on. The Longbow is too expensive for that."

wargame,3bbp8g,_CyrilFiggis_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:15:48 2015 UTC,"LOG Looks good. Would probably swap KV107 with CH-47 and ferry the supplies with the 10 pt trucks  INF You lack fodder. Check out the Syoujyu-buntai. You should definitely take the haebyung '90 over the defaults. 5 pts for one of the best AT launchers in the game is a no brainer. Mistral or PSAM (depending if you want range or accuracy) > than Stinger. Two UDT seals are redundant, you shouldn't be using Elite infantry as shock infantry. Get rid of one for the Spam infantry.  SUP Looks good, I would see if I could squeeze in a Closed Arrow. Comboed with the Short Arrow and Mistral/PSAM, you have one of the deepest and fastest IR AA nets in the game  TNK I'm pretty sure you should upvet your tanks. Two cards of K1 is redundant, you should drop one and look at the shiki-g for an infantry support tank that can still pack a punch against other tanks. The Kyu-maru shiki is one of the best superheavies in the game, you should swap the K1A1 with it.   REC People will argue this one with me, but I don't think that the ninjas are worth it. Although they are your only AA helo/exceptional optics, you aren't equipped for a helo rush anyway, and they simply aren't cheap or plentiful enough to stop a REDFOR helo push. I would take the Oh-6 instead. You will be able cover a wider area with recon for less $. Double rangers is again redundant. Look at the FIAT, and consider choosing only one type of recon infantry so you can pick up Nana shikis, allowing you to spam recon with any sort of tank push to keep yourself from going blind.   VEH Good choice. I think it is one of the only undesputably worth-it ATGM vehicles in the game. Consider picking up the napalm M113 as well. The Rensou 106mm is also (along with the ONTOS) one of the only good recoilless rifle vehicles in the game.    HEL You wasted a lot of points here. 4 cards of cobras? Choose one you like and stick with it. I ended up with 1 card of upvetted Ah-1ts. If you are running through that many cobras you have other problems. Use those extra 7 activation points in other areas.   AIR Dedicated ASF should have both Long and Short range missiles. Look at the F4-EJ or F-15J over the KF-16C. F-5A doesn't drop enough napalm to be effective IMHO. I would swap that for a peace pheasant II to take out tanks. Peace pheasant 1 and F-4EJ kei are redundant. Drop the Peace pheasant 1 and pick up the KF-16c block-52D for SEAD.  Use the points you saved from dropping some of those helos and spread it around the deck.   Not a bad start, just needs some work :)  EDIT Deck I came up with critiquing yours.

I'd do is swap out the syoujyu-buntai for sochong-su'85 in KAFV40/50 transports. 5 points more expensive, but you get the grenade launcher IFV and better ATGM, which is a major deal.   Downvet the K-9 Thunder. Its your only artillery card in the deck. It would be very inconvenient if you had to lay smoke with one unit.  Also, I noticed you left the F-4EJ in the screenshot. Probably not intentional...  Finally, I'd drop the UDT/Seals in the infantry tab and put in Teukjeonsas in the recon tab instead.

Make a thread about the bonuses and implicit bonuses and im sure someone will come outta the woodwork and make all that info explicit.
wargame,3bbp8g,Twisp56,2,Sun Jun 28 17:46:09 2015 UTC,"Czech player here. I strongly encourage you to keep playing this nation, you'll see when you will discover The Czechnology. Anyway, not a terrible deck, but you have some problems with veterancy (as you already noticed).  I assume you play mainly destruction, because you have just 4 cvs.   Logi: You could take the supply Mi-4 instead of one of the trucks. Helos are easier to micro than trucks, because you can shift click on the FOB and the ressuply location and they will do everything automatically. Inf: Make one of the Výsadkáři '90, they are your only infantry with high AP launchers. The Konkurs could be upvetted - if you are ok with the reduced numbers - and they could be in a cheaper transport(OT-62A). Ženisté are fine, but I would use Motostřelci, since they are your spam infantry used as fodder and to fill gaps - and you can't really do that with anything else (except reservists but they are shit).  Support: You said you dropped mortars, but they're still there. They are useful for somking, Ondavas can't do that. You have 2x8 KUBs, that's too much. Drop one card and upvet the other. Also upvet STROP II. Take Pldvk for rear security and poor man's STROP. However you shouldn't follow my advice about upvetting if you use (and lose) a lot of these units. If that's the case, you should probably learn to micro them better - switch off the KUBs when there's a SEAD threat. Tanks: You need a cheap fire support tank. Base T-72 can do that, T-72M too and even T-72Mcz. The DYNAs are nice for the ATGM,  but upvet them. T-72S is a bit cost-ineffective and in a weird spot, the threats it can deal with are fine for T-72M1M, but for anything better you need a Moderna. Example with german tanks: T-72M1M can deal with anything up to L2A0, T-72S is optimal against L2A1(no-one uses that one) and for 2A4 and 2A5 you need a Moderna. Recon: The infantry is fine, but change transports: Tatra 148 for Průzkumníci, OT-64 for one S.J. and Mi-8T or Mi-17 for the second one. Průzkumníci need to be as cheap as possible and the Mi-8 is there because you can't do Hind rush anyway as you don't have DHS or Mi-24V, but you can still sneak around with the Mi-8. You could take a BPzV Svatava or Sněżka for exceptional optics, maybe drop the SJ witj groun transport to get that. Vehicle: BRDM-2 Konkurs is overpriced, but you can keep it as a last resort. I would drop it. Helo: upvet both and one card of each is enough. Air: Many possibilities here. The 29 9-12A has a small payload, but some like it as it's the only survivable bomber. However as the playercount gets smaller, survivabilty matters less. For higher playercounts your selection is fine, but upvet everything except the 29. For small games: Upvetted MiG-23ML as ASF, downvetted Su-22 as nuke bomber, upvetted L-39ZA as helo murderer and light bomber, upvetted Su-25K as tank+infantry murderer.   Ninja edit: typo"

wargame,3bbp8g,Sanguinary_Guard,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:16:55 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I don't play much CW but here's some things I think would help with your deck.  Log: Man Kati has more supply per point.  Inf: Pretty much every non armored deck requires 5 cards of infantry. They are your bread and butter. That being said most of your options look ok. I'm personally not a fan of SAS but that's definitely more of a preference. Ghurkas 90 are great too. CA don't have great helicopters though. They'd be better off in a grizzly especially since CW has no good AA helo escort. Candian Rifles though are just bad. Takes some fusiliers 90 in 5 pt transports to use as meat shield. For fifth slot Canadian pioneers are great. They'll wreck infantry in towns with their smgs and flamethrower. Take them in the TH-495.   Sup: wolverines and AS-90s are great. You definitely want the challenger marksman over the chieftain though. That front armor means it can take a sead missile to the face and be close to the front. Tracked rapiers suck but there isn't really a good alternative besides ADATS if RnGesus cooperates or the stormer hvm which is a pretty solid ir aa platform. It's only issue is that it's a little slow. The mortars aren't the greatest. I'd drop them for stormers.  Tank: good all around. Not much to say here.  Recon: The AS.350 is good but the rest I think could use some work. I'm personally not a fan of recce as I think the recon slot could be better used but some people like them. I'd personally take something with more numbers that you can put everywhere on the map. The helo isn't great though. I'd take them in bison. You have two vehicle recon which is unnecessary. Pick your favorite vehicle and take them at lowest vet. Lastly I'd grab some pathfinders if you can. They look bad at first glance but they destroy other infantry with their machine gun.   Veh: Drop the chimera. It's just bad. I know at first it looks not too shabby but it really is pretty bad. Iltis tow-2 is good though to give you some atgms.  Hel: Lynx 20mm isn't bad but there are better things to be spending activation points on. I'd drop it. Same with the Lynx tow 2. Lynx 3 does its job better with hellfires with more range and ap. plus you get some bonus stingers.  Plane: A lot of redundancy here. Right now it looks like you have 3 cards of bombers, 1 Sead, and 1 ASF. I'd drop the Canadian hornet. You can use the GR.7 as a tank killer/infantry wipe. GR.5 I guess can be used to more effectively carpet bomb. Can't remember off the top of my head if CW has a better option for this. Eurofighter is good. I personally like the Electric Voodoos as sead. As it stands is say they're the most cost effective sead in the game (50% ecm for 90 points). If you must have 5 cards of air I'd suggest another ASF to bolster CWs inherit AA weakness.  Edit: I somehow forgot the F-111C. I'd drop the GR.5 and grab that monster. Also Vickers MK.11 in the Vehicle tab is a must."

WXgOQWCV5W6zyt1lj4SwRNZeUOss8mAhIZjIejGhdssMWCReQuoQUOKENPEZWRBoI1opnc2OXFQcFRw=  http://i.imgur.com/J5F78cH.jpg  Due to my inexperience, I still don't know exactly what kind of playstyle I prefer. Probably more on the defensive, but not sure, which is why I went commonwealth.  LOG: Don't know if I like having the FOB? As long as I have the MLRS, I obviously need it, but I tend not to use the MLRS.  INF: I know the golden rule is always 5 infantry, but I don't know. MANPADS seem bad, and I have access to quite a bit of good anti tank, I just don't know what I'd put as the fifth guy. Gurkhas are the main pushing force with diggers backing them up.  SUP: Again, MLRS I don't know if I like. Never feel like I use it right. Other than that, I know, at least, that the ADATS is kind of awful as much as I always want to put it in the deck. Don't know if my AA choices are 'correct.'  TNK: Couple of heavy to super heavy tanks to hold the line. Leopards for a more mobile attack force. I think the scorpion 90 is just amazing value, gun wise, for the price. I want to put in the chieftan mk10, but I don't know.  RCN: Don't know if I need both infantry. The recce are amazing with the AP power, at least, but is it worth the card slot? Otherwise, standard heli recon and a vehicle recon to accompany any pushes I make.  VHC: Versatile ATGM and autocannon wheeled vehicle. I'm not sure on the chimera. I think it's good value, from a defensive perspective?  HELI: Just grabbed one heli and grabbed the most versatile I could grab with the ATGM and anti-air missiles.  AIR: The three best planes the commonwealth have in the FC-111, Eurofighter, and the electric voodoo. I also grabbed a harrier because I love how fast they can resupply and be back on the field. Never know which harrier to get though.  So yeah. I need critiquing on the deck. I wouldn't mind some pointers on how to figure out if a card/unit is good. Like the eurofighter is technically not amazing, right, just because the eurocorp version is better and cheaper? But how do I figure that kind of stuff out without just staring at the armory. Even in the same deck I'm not sure if my comparing of cards is right (Pay 5 more points on a tank I should get how much better of a tank? A point more of armor and a bit more accurate?)."
wargame,3bbp8g,Aeweisafemalesheep,3,Sun Jun 28 02:54:27 2015 UTC,"logi - You don't need the helo. And you can take a 100 point car or a cmnd cheitain. Now you can put those 3 points into inf. inf - dbl gurk and speedy dig is fine. I'd downvet the dig tbh. If you want to helo drop then use SAS at game start. Highlanders are god awful. Besides that you can use reservist as fodder, can pio for cities, milan f2's for area denial, or whatever else you can find. support - i think bison mortars are over priced and don't deal enough dmg. 70 point 203mm have their ups, see my history for dicussion there. MLRS is an option for big games. The howitizers are straightforward and you have choices for small and big games. tank - mk3's are the only chally that can punch most anything besides the chally 2. I would replace the scorps with leoas1+ or c2 to act as like a t80. recon - u need exceptional helo. recce in helo is fine. personally i'd use pathfinders. i'd take aslav25 or fox instead of ferret. swingfire? more like swing and a missfire missiles. veh - chimera are horrible. low rof, no turret, just asks to die when morale dmg is taken. iltis tow-2, avre, that sort of stuff does well. helo - fine plane - you need kahu for atgm. F111 is for opening game cheese. after that it just becomes semi useless when the enemy is spread out on your X axis instead of the Y. For ASF planes i'd personally go for the 2 tornado at elite."
wargame,3bbp8g,WG_Theo,2,Sun Jun 28 03:42:34 2015 UTC,"The howitizers are straightforward   By which Aewe means that obviously the AS-90 has a whooping aim-time advantage over all other CW choices, which is not indicated by anything on the armory overview.  Does not mean the others are bad, but should be kept in mind depending on the role."

If you want to heli-insert either do so with light rifle 90 or Rangers. Navy Seals in V150. heli-insertion is only for early troops, and Seals lack an RPG to be effective in that role. The 75 point Recon Bradley is better. None of your stuff is really affordable though. Supercorba is too expensive. You need two to kill a redfor heli. Norad has a good couple of interesting vehicles. Ontos, Flame tank, CEV. maybe sacale back on the tanks. Is that the cluster Ardvark? get an iron or napalm bomber. Hornet is better than the A-10 due to better missiles."

wargame,3bbp8g,Kappa043,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:51:02 2015 UTC,"Let me just briefly cover some important changes.  LOG: You need a truck of some sort. The Canadian or ANZAC heavy one is good. Trade out either the FOB or the helo for it.  INF: Less helicopters. Gurkhas 90 are way better than 80. Take only the first card of Assault Pioneers, and get something else. I suggest SAS in a Lynx, to serve as AA/Commandos/helicopter force.  SUPPORT: Too much artillery. Lose a card of mortars, howitzers, or MLRS, and get yourself a solid AA piece instead. I like the Stormer with the Starstreaks.  TANK: Scrap all these. Take a card each of Leopard C2 (or MEXAS), Challenger 1 Mk. 3, and Challenger 2, as many as you can get per card.  RECON: Lose a helicopter, get some snipers. Canadian Recce are nearly invisible and can see for miles. I like SBS, too, if you need more commandos/recon. (You do.)  VEHICLE: Ditch the Rover Milan. You have ADATS for ATGM duty. The Jeep M40 could easily be swapped for a cheap Leopard or something in the Tank tab, or else a Recon tab vehicle.  HELO: You can do without the Lynx 20mm. And prolly the Bushranger too.  AIR: Looks good. If you can get 4 more points together, invest in another bomber or something. Also, the A-4K is great at antitank if you wanna snipe T-90s.  That's all I got for now, try making those changes and see how you like it. Remember, always take the max number per card."
wargame,3bbp8g,SovietPootis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:20:55 2015 UTC,"Blufor general deck, never done these before. I tried to choose the very best gems out of each country. I'm keeping my units mostly downvetted/upvetted depending on whether I'm playing a big game or not.  http://i.imgur.com/tcIEkvk.jpg  General thoughts:  Because I have only 50 activation points I decided to cheap out on logi tab.. and because of this I can't have heavy artillery.  Gurkhas '90 are superb, so I decided to have 2 cards of them. Gevaermenn '90 come with a nice autocannon transport. Not sure about my ATGM choice, but I figured it's the best since there's no Milan F3's.  One radar AA, long-range anti-helo and high fast-moving high DPS. I wanted to have big ammo capacities on my AA pieces. I really would have wanted closed arrows but eh. German mortars for that sweet 5HE damage.  4 superheavies is a force to be reckoned with. They're not the best superheavies in the game but 22AP/12RPM + 20 armor is not a joke. K1's and AS1+'s are very cost-efficient, so that's why I chose them.  Navy seals are M3A2 Bradley are self-explanatory. Rasit for excellent optics. Not so sure about JSDF Rangers, but I guess their sniper makes them decent shock recon.  Chumat is my favourite ATGM vehicle. It's so cost-efficient! Also, Zippo.  Needed one gunship for gunshippin', AH-1T with a Tow 2 does the job. Neat.  I'm not so sure about my air tab, but I didn't want anything too expensive so I went with these.   Also; F-111C is love, F-111C is life. Anyone who disagrees deserves a punch to the penis."
wargame,3bbp8g,Eurasian-HK,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:36:35 2015 UTC,"I play a general Blufor deck for most of my games. Your deck isn't bad but I will give you some pointers to make it better.    LOG - Don't know if you need the Command Tank unless you play a lot of conquest games. Could be 3 allocation points saved if you removed it.  INF - I like SAS in Lynx AH7 for my openings, so I would swap out one of your Gurkhas for them. Also the Japanese Chu-Mat ATGM team is superior to the Swedish ATGM team imo due to the increased accuracy and range. Amberfield is garbage for 10pts as it has 5HP and no weapons. It is no good being an infantry ATGM team if you can't out range the tanks your trying to kill.  SUP - Your long range radar AA isn't very long range. Maybe try a NOAH or I-HAWK PIPIII. Mistral truck and Mistral manpads team are redundant. I would swap Mistral trucks for 55pt Gepard or Crotale for the quick deployment. The 40pt version of the w.german mortar is better because of the increased autonomy. The 30pt W.German mortar needs to be refuelled more often I would like, especially when you are shooting and scooting.  TANK - Great choices with the Kyu-Maru Shiki & K1's, not too sure about the AS1+ as I find tanks less than 85pts to be highly situational. Might want to drop the AS1+ for more recon.  RECON - Good choices, but I would recommend you try taking a 2 man exceptional stealth recon team. I find the 2 man sniper teams to be some of the best recon in the game if you can move them from cover to cover and turn off their weapons for added stealth. W.German or Scandi versions are amazing value especially in an amphibious transport.  VEH - Chu-Mat jeep is redundant if you take Chu-Mat ATGM infantry team and also have Recon Bradley with TOW2 ATGM. Drop the jeep and replace with CEV for fire support. Zippo's are only worth it in small games, I find a F-4S Phantom II to be the best way to get flames on Blufor.    HEL - Drop Cobra for Apache. It is so much better for only 40pts more.  PLANE - A-4 ATGM plane is only good if you are playing Commonwealth or ANZAC. There are much better ATGM planes available to a blufor general deck like the F/A-18C and A-10.    Have attached a picture of my deck for your reference. It has worked for me and Im pretty happy with it. Again though this game is all about finding your play style. Hope these suggestions help.  http://i.imgur.com/KDk9IpQ.png"
wargame,3bbp8g,SovietPootis,2,Tue Jun 30 04:07:43 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I've made some changes to my decks.  http://i.imgur.com/92mVtOW.jpg  And here's where I disagree with you:  No changes to logi tab. I should have mentioned this being designed mainly for conquest, sorry.  I didn't intend this deck being an air opening deck but I suppose that would work with SAS. Celtics being an escort with that 4HP.. I suppose it COULD work but I feel like I'd be in disadvantage. Well, I'll give it a try anyway.  I know that Rolands fall a bit short in terms of range, but I like having extra ammo rather than extra range.  I haven't had too much luck with the 2-man squads, so I'm not going to include them in this deck.  I do like my flame tanks so I'm not going to remove Zippo. Added Cev though.  I don't think that Apache is THAT much better for extra 40 point. Not going to change.  Thanks for your help."
wargame,3bbp8g,Eurasian-HK,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:42:43 2015 UTC,"Like your revised deck. Glad i could help. The airborne opening with SAS, Celtics & Jaeger recon team is amazing for holding a forward position until the rest of your wheeled and tracked units arrive. 2 squads of SAS will pretty much down any jets and helicopters in one pass. If you are looking for the best units each country has to offer i cannot recommend the M-8 Panzerbil (in the recon tab) enough. They absolutely rekt infantry and are great for covering flanks cheaply."
wargame,3bbp8g,frankwouter,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:25:45 2015 UTC,My flair and ingame name agree.
wargame,3bbp8g,Aeweisafemalesheep,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:37:13 2015 UTC,"Logi - danish centurion inf -   smaw + lvtpa1 will give you grenades and much needed armor. Sapuer + t20 is an option to give you more AC. RBS atgm smashes all. Chu Mat plays AOD.    Support - Tam sam short arrow is a need. You could go no radar and run 2 card upvet. Track rapier FSA is an option. upvet adats is an option. NOAH is an option. For small games where multi can work you can try out the ~55 point howitizers to act as harrassment and AOD. This will combine well with the no FOB combo.    Tank and veh - you want to find leo1a5 or shiki e and you want ontos or rensou so you can push out and do forest combat vs nasty low tier units.    Recon - You need an exceptional helo. And there are countless good choices here. It's a toughie.    Helo - seahawk can work for 1v1. Otherwise you want that range and acc that only an apache can give. Otherwise go with helos you can cloud and air cav bust someone with.    plane - F111 is cheese. Don't expect it to last forever and always use it as early as you can. Other solid choices for things: JPN F-1, SK Peace pheasant. F-16A Fighting Falcon. Wild Weasel. F-5a puff. F-16A Block 15. Napalm phantom. And you can always try the ryu or CF-104 for cheapo plane spam. GL HF."
wargame,3bbp8g,frankwouter,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:20:22 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree on the rbs 56 point. The Chu mat has low ap and is pretty much useless vs any decent tank. The transport options are also pretty bad. The rbs 56 may have tank range, but it hits really hard and can even kill heavy tanks effectively. The 5 hp makes it really hard to kill in cover and it even survives a tanks hell in open ground. It also has 8 ammo, which sort of compensates for the increased price. It also have excellent transportation options, with the xa180 and the stvr9040.   They both serve a different purpose (chu mat vs light stuff only, useless vs any arty fire or tanks, rbs is great vs tanks and 5 hp helps vs arty fire), but chu mats are only 20 pts in the vehicles tab, making them a much better choice right there."
wargame,3bbp8g,Eurasian-HK,1 point,Tue Jun 30 11:35:32 2015 UTC,"Totally agree that rbs 56 is better at killing super heavies than the chu mat but 20ap is hardly low. The 60% accuracy and increased range over the rbs 56 is where the chu mats  excel. I use atgm infantry in towns mainly to create a no go zone for the enemy. If I need to take out a super heavy tank, I use either ATGM planes, another super heavy, attack helicopters or some sort of TOW2 vehicle like the 75pt recon Bradley or a combination of these. I hope this clears things up a little bit."
wargame,3bbp8g,frankwouter,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:05:12 2015 UTC,The 1 tick of range really doesn't matter. All fire support falls within range and the accuracy is still really good.  I do prefer versatily and the rbs 56 and transport choice offers that over the Chu mat.

I went through all the viable armored decks, norad, eurocorps, blue dragons, commonwealth and Scandi. I dont want to ramble away so im just going to state what I dont like about them. In order of wich one I like the best, starting from the top  Scandi - No good non-radar AA wich can keep up with the tanks. And the STRV 121 isnt very armored. EuroCorps - Poor recon, wich can really screw up situations. Sort of good Non-radar AA  Norad - No atgms, no shock inf, no good line inf. (We need GOOD SHOCK INF to help ceritain situations)  Blue Dragons - Logistics problems goes for all japs units, No good recon vehicles (we need VERY GOOD RECON). No good non radar AA and yet again NO GOOD SHOCK INF.  Commonwealth - VERY BAD AA, enough said.  Here's my deck wich works best for me atleast, lets see how you like it.

AA - Superb, good non-radar AA, good long range AA slow but we have the rolands too balance that.  Tanks - Superb super heavys, superb heavy tanks and superb medium tanks.  Recon - All around good, bradley is really nice and the spartans are really nimble and cheap.  Vehicles - Ikv 91 is good, couldnt really afford anything else.  Helo - A neat Cobra.  Planes - Dont really use alot of planes, these one meets MY needs.  As I said, this works best for my playstyle.  Opinions?"

The 20-30 points are worth the extra optics, and you can deploy them on their own as well. Having lots of extra means that it doesn't matter if you lose one. I'd also spring for a tank CV instead of that 2S3 Akastiktyka, maybe a T-80UK or something to go along with your main tank force. Finally, I'd trade something for more Tunguskas.

I'll be honest and say that I haven't had a chance to test it out yet as I made it right before calling it quits for the evening.  I'm sure that Eurocorp is infinitely more competitive than a single nation French deck but I still want to give this a shot as I think it could be fun.  I've obviously stuck to wheels where possible to keep it as a fairly mobile force.     Also, I know that many people advise against playing naval but I kind of like it-particularly with the smaller ships and have a specific inquiry based on that. I want to include an LCU but I don't really know what to drop. I'd like to keep two cards of the STRBs and I heard that zippos are good for stunlocking ships but I also feel as though I can't drop the La Fayette in order to deal with larger ships or the Dong-Hae to cover the air."
wargame,3bbp8g,SovietPootis,3,Thu Jul 2 11:51:16 2015 UTC,"Here's my two cents, I recommend that you take them with a grain of salt:  You need some sapeurs in your deck for some AI capabilities. You could either remove Chasseurs (which aren't that good tbh) or Mistral. You decide.  If you decide to remove mistrals, add some mistral trucks to your support tab. They are pretty nice. If not, then add the M270 LRM. 11HE rockets are not a joke, very good at halting a push or stunning a stronghold.  Having both AMX-40 and AMX-32 in the tank doesn't seem very productive - they both fulfill the same job, only the other is slightly worse. Remove one, and maybe add AMX-10 RC SB. You want mobility? Well, there's a wheeled tank for you.  Perhaps a second card of commandos para with wheels? I always have one wheeled recon inf in my decks. These would also be a replacement for the removed chasseurs.  God, remove that Vab Mephisto. 40% accuracy ísn't going to get you anywhere. Also, shit damage for that price. You'd better rely on your Milan F3's as the primary ground ATGM.  Remove either Tiger HAP or celtics. You don't need 2 cards of AA heli. I find HAP's better since they have 6HP instead of 4 (they can take 2 hits against other AA helis). If you remove Celtic then maybe remove HAD and add Gazelle Hot 2? I don't think that you would need 2 separate gunships.  Cassiopees are also good, only 40 points for a nice autocannon - great at harassing behind enemy lines in smaller games!"
wargame,3bbp8g,Paladin_G,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:17:23 2015 UTC,"Keep the HAP, ditch the Celtic and Mephisto.   Replace Chasseurs with Rima 85 (The ones armed with the APILAS). They're dependable line infantry with a monster 20rpm AT weapon.   Put Mistral trucks in support tab, or the AMX Oeil Noir AA gun. They're decent fodder and good for stunning bombers.   1 Rafale is usually enough. I'd take another Mirage bomber.   If you have points left over, take the AMX-10RC recon vehicle. It's decent recon and can kill infiltrators."

The only decent helo open is lightrifle90+BH to just grab a place. But you don't need to do that. You can use pio+bison to play cities instead of the helo open and actually make use of canadian stuff. support - 70 point chap. range game wins. use in pairs to keep the mi28 and similar nasty things away. tank - downvet hc. you need quantity. I'd replace the mexas with m8ags as you need some decent support fire and you're not running ontos. recon - don't air open seals. veh - if the comvat is working for you, great. Cev, ontos, iltis tow2, flamem113, tons of choices. helo - fine and dandy. plane - You don't have effective atgm and the unit that does that is the f-18c. The a-ten is very hit or miss and needs to circle an area as the enemy pushes meaning it could end up targeting fodder instead of side shotting an mbt.

You can afford to upgrade your Cobras and ditch the AH-64A. Then you can lose the C2 Leopard, don't need 'em with the Mexas. Finally, ditch the LAV CV and replace your TACOM with amphibious Canadian CV infantry. That gets you 6 extra points, to spend in the Support and Recon tabs.   The way you structure your infantry is highly personal, but I usually bring three things as a rule of thumb: anti-aircraft, anti-infantry, and solid line shock. Your AA options are Javelin, Stinger A, and Stinger C. Your anti-infantry options are Pioneers, SEALs (take two cards if you pick this), and Assault Engineers (worthless mostly). Your shock infantry options are CanAb 80/85, Rangers (take two cards if you pick this), and USMC 90. You'll also need Recce, in something other than a Chinook. Beyond that, take whatever you please.  For that extra support card, I suggest you take either the Avenger or the Wolverine. You need some wheeled AA to cover your wheeled vehicles, and those are your only two options in this deck."
wargame,3bbp8g,KFrenzy9,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:59:09 2015 UTC,"This week Im posting a Scandinavian general deck and a Eurocorps general deck.   Eurocorps general  This is a deck I use really often, and I am overall pretty happy with it. But I think it could use some improvements.  LOG: Not much to say about this.  INF: I think I need some cheaper and more spammable units here, but dont know what to drop or put in.  SUP: Pretty okay with this, thinking about putting in a MARS, but dont know if its a good trade for anything.  TNK: Also think this is okay, dont know about if I should keep the LeCLerc or drop it?  REC: Want to add the Tiger recon chopper, but dont know what to drop. Allouette would be logical choice, but I really like there cheapness and availability.  VEH: Pretty okay with this aswell, any nice additions?  HEL: Not much to say about this, seem like logical choices to me.  AIR: Really unsure about this one, feels pretty subpar to me.  Scandi general  This is the first time trying a Scandinavian deck. I see Scandinavia being used pretty often, but I feel like Im not seeing what makes them powerfull. It seems to me that theyre not really great in any catagory, but Im probably wrong.  I appreciate any feedback on both decks."
wargame,3bbp8g,Aeweisafemalesheep,3,Sun Jun 28 15:18:33 2015 UTC,"EC inf - jager spam is gonna be a need, maybe drop the mistral for it support - i'd take the cheaper gepard outside of 1v1. depending on map the more expensive mortars may be worth it for the speed. Off road the mortars you got love to eat a wide smerch. tank - Depending on player count you may want to switch out the 2a4 for leo1a5. Consider upveting the base leo2.

wargame,3bbp8g,frankwouter,2,Sun Jun 28 17:06:32 2015 UTC,"Quick first comments on Scandi Deck, will improve later.  Get the stvr 103 cv tank, it's really nice for the price.  Drop the horrible pansarskyte and replace them with gevaermenn 90 in 5 pts m113 or 10 pts  autocannon m113 or dragoner in 2 armor m113.   FSK and FSJ is really redundant. I would replace on of them with kustjagere  90 (best short range anti inf ingame), stormers in cv90 (mg3 shock inf in a nice ifv) or eryx fire support inf (sturmgenoir 90 something) in whichever transport you like (great for stunning anything in numbers and withouth min range, also keeps inf and vehicles 1000m away. Works best in combination with mg3 inf spam (eryx stunlocks, inf helps with killing and as meatshield).  Get the panserbill in the recon tab, cornerstone of the Scandinavian as fire support, wheeled spetznatz, flanking unit and cheap recon (I use about 14 per game easily). Remove recon jeep.   Perfect aa setup, covers all targets and had a ka52 counter (rbs 90 rover and inf). Also use the ottomagic vs ground targets which it simply destroys.  Remove the autocannon vehicle, you can get a much better ifv with shock inf/flamers/fire support eryx.  The ikv 105 is a nice cheap tank destroyer that is also amphibious.  Also think about using the sk60b, best cheap atgm plane vs targets with 2 or less top armor and inf.   Also consider making room for a puff, great helo sniper and sead plane for 70 pts.   Scandinavia excells in infantry, planes and armor, while maintaining a very nice recon tab and a decent enough atgm helicopter. It's biggest weaknesses are the ka52 with helo spam and long range open ground fights (>2275 m vs Russia). It goes unspec, moto and mech (and support).  This is how I run my Scandi deck: Imgur, I switch the m270 for bkan1c or nasams depending on the game/map. I also switch out the stormpionjager for eryx fire suppport and the stormers for fallskirmsjeger. I Am really starting to like that setup."
wargame,3bbp8g,_CyrilFiggis_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:52:35 2015 UTC,"Decided to build a Sov-Kor airborne deck. The deck is very good on maps with lots of woods. It is very weak against any deck that can spam tanks or planes in significant quantities. There are no real tanks in the deck, and it lacks infantry variety due to the necessity of having two transport options for most of the cards. There also isn't any real spammable infantry. I went Sov-Kor over straight soviet as I didn't really need the extra activation points, and there are a couple niche units (B-5, m1992, mi-4 cargo and s-8) that can really make the difference for a minimal investment.

wargame,3b1ze0,DesertEagle5,9,Mon Jun 29 02:13:17 2015 UTC,"No, IMHO Czech Specialny Jednotky'90 are better than Spetznaz GRU, because sniper rifles in wargame are only have advantage in defense and in the open field, while in the other cases, especially in town fighting (that is the majority of inf firefights) MG is way better, especially [CQC] MG, that Jednotky have."

It does have a really high suppression on the sniper and a nice 20 rpm launcher and comes in both 5 pts trucks and btr 90.   I combine them with normal spetz and some vdv 90 and an osa to create the ultimate forest force.   Still not as good as eryx fire support + Scandi mg3 shock inf wombo combo though."
wargame,3b1ze0,frankwouter,2,Thu Jun 25 09:33:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, their availability is their only downside. I haven't used them in a 1v1 yet, because in 1v1's I don't think they're viable stacking them as a starting force. Any infantry, no matter how powerful they are, are probably going to get annihilated when surrounded by 3-4 stacks of cheaper infantry and overrun. But in team games, now that's a different story. My starting force in team games usually consist of a stack of 4 GRU's, 2 konkurs, and 1 T-55 with some form of AA accompanying them. I use the GRU's to clear out whatever town I'm trying to take over, then I use the konkurs when the town is taken to destroy any transport vehicles or tanks that are trying for a retake.   I haven't used GRU's in forests yet. I get so afraid of losing them as they're a lot more vulnerable when not in buildings."

wargame,3b1ze0,steveraptor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:41:30 2015 UTC,GRU are very good.  But I think normal USSR spetsnaz are better because they can tank so much more in the right conditions and are t as fragile.  GRU will still give BLUFOR a headache though.

Best to use them behind another infantry as cover fire, then they work well, since the suppression from the sniper rifles are really good. If aggressive recon infantry is what u after, then the formoza is the king of them all."
wargame,3b0xi1,wienerschnitzle,11,Thu Jun 25 02:10:47 2015 UTC,F/A-18C is great for only 20pts more. The only reason I don't take the A-10 is because of how slow it takes to get to the action. If I need to kill a superheavy I usually don't have the luxury of time on my side. So 1000kph beats 500kph. If time isn't an issue then an apache or longbow will do just as well or better than an A-10.
wargame,3b0xi1,Eurasian-HK,10,Thu Jun 25 09:35:57 2015 UTC,"I like the A10 since it can take a beating and loiter in the area to take out enemy forces, and it can provide CAS for infantry, the hornet is great but the turn radius when striking near enemy ADN kills it sometimes, where the A10 can turn on largish dime  Also BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT"

wargame,3awwyi,Tied12,19,Wed Jun 24 03:58:40 2015 UTC,Range and effect on target are on par with light riflemen.
wargame,3awwyi,frankwouter,11,Wed Jun 24 05:31:57 2015 UTC,Light riflemen 90 in fast moving helos is not a terrible opening move.    They're great at killing those fast moving transports and fire support vehicles.  They'll grab tanks with side shots all the time when people aren't paying attention.  I like them at least.
wargame,3awwyi,LePoisson,2,Wed Jun 24 11:56:06 2015 UTC,"Most fire support out ranges them and they lack the firepower to stop inf. The price with their helicopter makes it really hard to choose them vs a unit of rangers or smaw (which also stops inf from walking in).  Motorized is never your issue if your helo rush works correctly (they only have machine guns or bad autocannons). The inf will still enter your town, even if they walk 1 km.  And I think they lack the firepower to deal with mech/tracked stuff."
wargame,3awwyi,frankwouter,5,Wed Jun 24 12:12:44 2015 UTC,"Most fire support our ranges them   The Super Dragon has a range of 1925m.... so only tanks out range them, and tanks won't kill the Light Riflemen '90 fast enough to get transports through. Not to mention if tanks are shooting the Light Riflemen '90 it's because you've probably just ran into them unexpectantly with your troop transports (otherwise how would you have eyes on them?).  The entire point of a chopper rush is to create a temporary toehold in territory you wouldn't have otherwise been able to reach even with motorized transports. Quite frankly Light Riflemen '90 are perfect for the job assuming you're using them on the right map and the right kind of territory.   they lack the firepower to stop inf   It's not about fighting infantry, it's about preventing the enemy transports from getting anywhere near the town in the first place. If you've done it correctly then the fact that Light Riflemen '90 can actually fight enemy infantry is just a bonus for later on. You also commonly end up mowing down enemy infantry with the m240 after they have had had to abandon their transports around 600-900m from the edge of the city."

Place them reasonably close to the frontline and buy 2 20 pts supply trucks to keep a supply line up (they use a lot ammo when they are effective). They are great as a way to ensure air dominance, since they have a good change to stun a b5 before it drops bombs and it gets really good if it upvets itself. Do not place it in obvious spots or far away from roads and relocate after firing.  You might want to use nasams if you prefer a more mobile style and you are fine with 3.5km range. It is wheeled, 100 kph offroad and highest dps and f&f of any bluefor missile aa. Keep much ammo nearby, since it fires 2-4 missiles at a single target.    TL;DR Use it as hawk without the annoying radar switching and use number for a 100% air defense net."

European Escalation is also ok to start with, the first campaign acts as a semi-tutorial.  If not, then feel free to ask. There are a few commands I discovered while messing around, which might be relevant to what you ask. For example, if you want to deploy units in a 4-units group, you can Ctrl + click on the icon and then you already deploy a battlegroup. In case you rather want smaller groups, you can hold Shift while clicking on the deployement icon, and for each click you add an unit to the group. You can also hold shift when clicking on where your units will be deployed, so you don't leave the deployment screen and can immediately deploy a second battlegroup.  For grouping units together, select them (they have to be the same units, you can't group a M1 Abrams with a Leopard 2), have them move close to each other, and hit the regroup button in the bottom right part of the screen. If I remember correctly, you first have to click ""show formations"" or something like that before the option being available.  If you want to put a numerical shortcut to one or several units, select them, hit Ctrl and a number between 1 and 9. Then, whenever you hit the same number again, you will select whatever units you had. Double hitting the number moves your camera to the unit."
wargame,3ayltm,Milleuros,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:40:35 2015 UTC,Just a heads up but you should never buy a group of four  ever. Two groups of two always.

wargame,3ayltm,11sparky11,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:29:34 2015 UTC,"It reduces the damage area of effect weapons do vs your unit, since they are less bunched up. This also reduces suppression and makes it so that the enemy can't fire at all your units at once with 1 unit.   There are some exceptions, like jager spam in small cities and forests and most fire support inf."
wargame,3ayltm,frankwouter,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:06:10 2015 UTC,"Disagreed. Group size should be a function of effect on target, ease of micromanagement and benefit from microing.  It is perfectly acceptable to have a four-stack of SU122. Spending twice as long to manage these units would be wasteful, and the payoff virtually nil.  Or take certain IR-AA units like the Avanger, which have about a 1-in-3 chance to hit a medium-ECM plane. If you use a group of 2 they will likely only get one hit, which does not kill the plane. If you use a 4-stack you have a significant chance to actually kill it.  Or, on the other hand look at Longbows or a TU-72. These are so effective - and expensive, that you should not stack them at all, but take your time to micro them individually."
wargame,3ayltm,WG_Theo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:40:42 2015 UTC,"What the others said is good, here's some quick info about controls:  Select unit * Right click: moves unit in a straight line * Right click and hold to rotate unit or place along hedge line  * Attack then left click: unit will move until it finds a target and then stops, aims and shoots * Move fast then left click: unit will take the fastest way to destination (mostly using roads) * Reverse then left click: unit reverses, in order to keep facing the enemy with the most armored side while retreating  * Regroup: will group up to 4 units of the same type (they have to be exactly the same unit) * Split: will split up grouped units into individual units * Fire position: Use this command to fire artillery or to use direct fire on unseen units. * You can use SHIFT to queue command for the same unit. (ie: move fast here, unload, move fast here)  Try going to options > controls and see what you like there. You can still the commands in the bottom right corner first.  Welcome to WarGame and good luck!"

I will add that once you have gotten used to the controls consider playing through an easy campaign before you start in mp. European escalation has the best campaign for learning IMO, but either way you will get good practice against an easy opponent in any campaign. Keep the points low so you arent overwhelmed with hundreds of units."

wargame,3axkde,DubWubber,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:39:20 2015 UTC,"Although I like the Idea of my Abrams being able to smoke like they do IRL, it would not work game play wise.  If every unit could deploy smoke it would make the game really micro heavy having to choose when each individual unit would smoke.  You also run into the problem of units smoking when you don't want them to and breaking your line of sight or giving away your position.  Some cheap mortars are effective a smoking and cut down on spam."
wargame,3axkde,gunnyschlomo,3,Fri Jun 26 15:45:35 2015 UTC,"Tacops 4 did it the right way: give you an option to decide if your units would pop smoke if they were spotted (or fired upon, forgot) or you could decide to pop smoke only if hit.    Think of how useful the latter option (or something similar, not hit but dropped below 4hp) would be for IFVs, ATGM vehicles etc.  Basically a menu would pop up when you clicked on a unit or group of units/unit type that would allow you to select these options.  Tacops 4 also let you select what types of units yours would fire upon or give priority fire to.  Don't want your ATGMs to pop transports?  Switch them to fire at tanks only.  TBH there also just needs to be a POP button that lets you save your tanks from ATGM planes and helis."
wargame,3axkde,DubWubber,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:22:53 2015 UTC,"I still think that the auto-smoke mechanic would be extremely difficult to implement correctly in Wargame. I would like the ability to not waste two hellfires on a topaz though, that would be cool.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong, I think that tank ECM is secretly modeled in game because sometimes atgms randomly miss when they are really close to them.  And to flip your last point around, helicopters, especially 90+ point ones need some sort of countermeasures.  ATGMS are already underwhealming in game and tbh do not need to be nerfed any more by giving tanks/vechs smoke."
wargame,3axkde,gunnyschlomo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:50:50 2015 UTC,"Agree, some helis are too susceptible to MANPADS, and the problem is that to somewhat remedy that, some of them are also not susceptible enough to SPAAG (and autocannon) fire.  You should be able to give a class of vehicles the ability to pop smoke if they've been taken below a certain HP, it would help gameplay by being able to salvage an attacking armored force if you screw something up.  It wouldn't cover a field in smoke, just hide the vehicle long enough to rescue it with something else or lay down real smoke with mortars.  So frustrating to watch your superheavy reverse move as it gets nickel and dimed by ATGMs."

wargame,3as9vj,caster,14,Tue Jun 23 06:26:03 2015 UTC,"Soviets having a larger fleet and superior ship-to-ship combat capabilities are fairly well known, I thought.

wargame,3as9vj,Sanguinary_Guard,9,Tue Jun 23 07:09:01 2015 UTC,A lesson learned from the Second World War no doubt. Naval aviation proved to be more decisive than direct ship to ship combat.  The whole world knows about the U.S. belief in carriers and the power projection they grant. They are one of the primary reasons the U.S. is the worlds last superpower. The U.S. Is the foremost believer in carrier doctrine and it can be argued that no one does it better. I just didn't realize the Soviets had amassed that many ships. Although they do never get rid of anything.   Whether which country would have prevailed in a Cold War naval engagement isn't something I think can be determined however.
wargame,3as9vj,caster,2,Tue Jun 23 07:39:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly the fleets hardly matter. Any realistic escalation scenario is going to be all about the nukes anyway, which means concealed nuclear missile submarines are the real problem."

Sure you get the satisfaction of wiping out a taskforce, but it also means that your opponent is going to break out his nukes and go the gull hog.   At the risk of coming off naive: Most escalation scenarios would consist of two armies trying to take the most territory / inflict the most casualties before third parties step in and hammer out compromises (bear in mind am basing this off the Kargil War, the only real-world example we have)"

wargame,3aqppd,osaka_amd,8,Tue Jun 23 08:03:38 2015 UTC,"Here's a few pointers:   Make sure to always always always get really emotional about winning/losing, don't make the noob mistake trying to enjoy the game regardless of whether you win or lose. Don't even bother trying to carry bad team mates, it's literally literally literally literally literally literally literally impossible. Just make sure to win the game by setting up a pubstomp game with your friends. Also, definitely don't play against your friends in a private 1v1/2v2/3v3.... lol then you wouldn't be on the same team and you might actually lose. So dumb! Also make sure when you lose to a certain tactic, make sure you immediately disregard that tactic as ""fucking bullshit""... because you're totally right and there's definitely no chance you just got out played. Definitely don't place cheap shock recon. infantry across your front line, it's totally pointless they won't see anything or help you in any way. 100% a huge waste of money. Make sure to buy a ton of recon vehicles with ""Good"" optics, ""Good"" optics are totally ""Good""... they sometimes see shit right in front of them, and it's helpful sometimes when you need to see shit right in front of your fucking face. Never ever use Radar AA because it's totally not worth learning to hotkey & toggle Radar AA when you can just use Infrared, Radar AA is just for tryhard neckbeards who use cheap tactics. Never play smaller 2v2/3v3/4v4 games, only play 10v10. The incredibly nuanced and complex metagame of 10v10 totally gets lost in those smaller games. Definitely never play conquest. That shit is a total arty camp fest because it's ""so easy"" for one team to just blow your entire army up and take the majority of the map, and then they can just sit there and win which is totally bullshit. In destruction you can at least come back with superior unit sniping skills with your ATACMs. Never use any hotkeys, that shit is fucking a waste of time I tried it once and it just took longer because you can't just memorize them all it's impossible.  Never ever use fucking smoke, that shit is also for tryhard neckbeards and it don't even work guud. I guess it would work good if you use the shift key to que up a nice line of smoke, but that shit takes so long to micro the game will be over by the time you pull it off trust I tried it's fucking impossibly hard. Never use the shift button to que up any other commands either, totally cheesy tactic. Never bring AA choppers to escort your chopper rush, total waste of money because there's a 50/50 chance the enemy might not be doing a chopper rush in which case you get to land them for free. If the enemy does do his own chopper rush with escort chopper and blows yours out of the fucking sky for free, it was worth the risk because losing 50% of your army in the first 30 seconds of the game doesn't actually matter as much as you might think. Never play in-house games on Reddit TS, they are definitely the least fun way to play this game because those guys are mostly tryhard neckbeard conquest players who just rage at you when you try to tell them exactly how you think they should be playing. If you do play in-house games, and you had the worst score on your team definitely don't ask for advice... it would be an admission that they might be better than you, and you ain't no chump."

I played like in a normal 2v2 or something, so I captured the two middle zones without much problems, but he rushed my secondary reinforcement zone with Blackhawks. He put a cv there and neutralized it. At this point I focused mostly on the frontline rather than my rear, which led to two things - I controlled pretty much the whole map, and he managed to get some units to my cv in my starting zone. 3x V-150 90mm vs. my lonely cv squad -> the cv somehow survived with one HP and I managed to clear my base zone. Then I killed his base cv and he got mad. That's the story."

wargame,3aqc7w,Futski,8,Mon Jun 22 17:34:23 2015 UTC,Best advice I can give you is this: you need to try to prevent the opponent from fighting you on his terms. Meaning don't allow him to use his strength's against you effectively.  You have to stop seeing this game as a game of counters. It isn't. It's a big mind game that just so happens to have hundreds of playing pieces. Granted it is vital that you learn how those pieces interact with each other and that can take a lot of work.  But in the end your battlefield knowledge will dissolve against a player who can predict all of your moves.  The next time you play a game try thinking about what you can do to gain the initiative against your opponent. Put him on the defensive so that he never gets the chance to bear his strengths against you and thus you will be able to field your strengths against him. Good luck!

wargame,3aqc7w,Azmodius_The_Warrior,6,Tue Jun 23 16:37:09 2015 UTC,"I see too often people being wimps about fighting ATGMs.  Firstly the only time to be scared of ATGMs are teams inside cities, they're very hard too spot and it's a solid defence. Forests and organic cover can be countered with any type of recon.  Second never back up from a spotted ATGM, commit directly forward and take it out, the very good ATGMs are usually lightly armoured and can be one or two shotted.  On the subject of Soviet tank ATGMs, they're are very inaccurate relatively, the T-80U and T-80UM are the exception. Most of the other tank ATGMs aren't too difficult to scare and eliminate once in gun range.  On the subject of the T-80 series, they have a fatal weak spot, a very low top armour rating. Meaning they're vulnerable to cluster munitions and laser guided bombs. A Nighthawk can take out a T-80 easily.  This is advice from someone who uses elite T-80Us with the intention of only using the ATGM. The only time I'm threatened is by heavy tanks or via the nighthawk since it can bomb and escape easily, and gets a guaranteed kill."

wargame,3aqc7w,triarii7,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:30:22 2015 UTC,"Try mortars. I find they are the natural counter to ATGMs. Even one or two of them. Even though they won't damage the tank, they will still suppress it, which is usually enough to throw off the accuracy of the ATGM. You will your shells within a few metres of the tank, however, and it will only give you a window of about ten or fifteen seconds.   Pop out of cover recon and with your own thin-skinned but hard-hitting ATGM vehicles and you should be able to pop that tank before it recovers.  Failing this method, smoke the whole treeline. They can't shoot you if they can't see you.   I only play ANZAC, whose heaviest tank is the 55-point Leopard AS+1, so needless to say I dont fight T-80s head on.   Combining a 30-point mortar, a 15-point recon car and between 30 and 60 points worth of ATGM vehicle and you can kill a 150-point missile tank, no dramas.  But then the recon Akula will turn up and snipe everything you have from the other side of the map anyway, so...."

Using a cat C deck of course will screw you, but a 25% level of disparity in unit selections doesn't matter when the disparity in player skill is far larger.   If someone is struggling with a unit like that it is because of a lack of development of fundamental skills needed for the game.   Having the most minmaxed deck and starting force won't compensate for that, and is totally the wrong solution.

Mi-24s and KA-52 are countered by things like Crotale, Chapparal, Manpads, Spaags or even straight up by DAPs.  That beings said a rush in sufficient strength can wreck a lot of opposition, especially if players do not keep some points in reserve to counter unexpected stuff.  Heli-rushes are infamous for that because helicopters are fast enough to capitalize the surprise effect, and because players tend to underinvest in AA, which has little use in other situations.  Still, if you mentally prepare for a heli-rush and set some points aside, they are rarely game-wrecking."

However these are typically not frontline units, but support units that derive their strengths from moving around.  ATACMs, Patriot, Smerch and Burratio are all units that can kill a lot and usually survive a match. However, they take a long time to reload, so they only make themselves felt every now and then, but wont insta-pave the way to enemy spawn."

This is something I took upon my self when I was new and sucked at offense, I would secure the flanks and the base with AA and RECON. This can make a huge difference with a MP game and gives you a chance to participate positively in a game.   Try it in your next 10v10."
wargame,3ap9z8,Rafael09ED,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:36:59 2015 UTC,"No, that's actually a terrible idea that uses up your starting points. Just get a few recon helis, and save your money and use the AA where they will actually do something instead of sitting there all game."

wargame,3ap9z8,Major-Dispair,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:15:25 2015 UTC,"Because you need a force to fight if they try anything. You can't just keep eyes in the front, you have to have something to fight that can adapt to what ever they do, and then you can use your reserve force to fill anything that is lacking based off of what they do.   Second, you mentioned that you save money by using recon helis, but helicopters have useless stealth because they can't hide in buildings or forests, that leaves them prone to being killed. Having units in reserve instead of killed is better. Plus for newer people this is way easier and beneficial than trying to micro helicopters for recon."

wargame,3ap9z8,Major-Dispair,-2,Mon Jun 22 18:00:35 2015 UTC,"First of all, calling me ""son"" doesn't work. I get that you're trying to psychologically put me down and try to prove that you are more knowledgeable than I am, but stuff you learn in Psych 101 doesn't apply in general.  Second of all, I said get a few recon helis. 2 recon helicopters can stop a helicopter rush if you even have a few brain cells dedicated to situational awareness, which apparently you confess to not having.  And your units will get slaughtered by a bigger force because you decided to spend half your points on base defense, while they, being a more experienced and logical player, didn't. If you actually had some form of strength, even a noob can win. More units generally overwhelms less units.  And yes, I am a better strategist than you are.

wargame,3ap9z8,DasHeadCrapHGN,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:58:53 2015 UTC,"=_= You are completely ignoring the fact that this player admitted to being new at Wargame and deny a completely valid strategy of leaving behind a token force at spawn for the off-chance of a Redfor heli rush.  A recon chopper will give you some warning but usually never in time as a Redfor player who knows what he is doing will just cruise by (I also sometimes turn the weapons off so that the recon chopper doesn't ping to his owner that it is getting attacked which works on the bigger maps). Even if they were paying attention and have the points to call in a lot of AA to prevent this rush it would never arrive in time. If you call in jets you will need 2 IR missiles per chopper (assuming Mi24s) and so that wont work as well.  However having 2 manpad teams on the coast will wreck their push enough that by then reinforcements will be able to come and fill the tank. I would say 100~200 points in a 10v10 is a great investment for this especially considering a new player that would most likely loose it in the first few minutes anyway.  In fact you do need base defense on maps such as Straight to the Point, Back to Inchon, almost any map with a naval spawn, etc."

The point is that a large scale engagement between tanks and autocannon vehicles will never end in the favor of the autocannons.

Jav and SAS could be redundant, i feel it's an OR choice. You open SAS OR use javs and play standard. Also, CAN javs have bison which is utility for free. If you don't play one of those two then diggers90 or some sort of fodder or even milan F2 can be played.      support - cent marksmen or chally. chally could survive a sead missile. cent marksmen has quantity but lacks speed. I wouldn't upvet stormer for bigger games. If you're not using bombers then consider 70 point 203mm howitzers which will be super effective on certain maps. tank - I would trade out a helo and get a mk3 in there just so you don't get abused in bigger games. I think mk2 is over priced for what it does. And personally I'd run a leoc2 or as1+ for a cost effective low tier but mexas is fine. Recon - british exceptional helo. I think a pair of aslav25s could face down btr90s and such better than a single coyote. veh - fine helo - redundancy Plane - Kahu is a need."
wargame,3ajod1,KFrenzy9,2,Tue Jun 23 23:20:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips on both decks.
wargame,3ajod1,Aeweisafemalesheep,2,Wed Jun 24 14:12:54 2015 UTC,"RD gen logi - use the chinese 2 armor cmnd tank inf - spoke about this elsewhere in the thread i think. Support - 30 point shilka is a tricky beast. imo neva > hq61. Tank - upvet lowend armor. Personally i use nk's t72 for forest fighting like its a base t80. recon - again, exceptional helo recce. 20 point recon NK tank is solid as mentioned elsewhere veh - the zsu's aren't really worth it. helo - fine plane - take a look at j-7h, q5d (can punish tanks that retreat into forest), and f-7b is good against stuff like apache/longbow.    Like i say to everyone, if you want the fast, fun and furious RD deck then you should go try out RD moto.     SKA decks are easy mode. Spam reservists, a couple vdv90, get quad t90 and buratino up for ground. And point and click adventure with B5's. Woooot."

wargame,3ajod1,osaka_amd,2,Sun Jun 21 12:22:02 2015 UTC,"Infantry Advice  General: Bring AA missile teams and always bring generally cheap infantry in 5 point transports...  You also lack cheap recon... a fatal error on many parts  Eurocorp lineup - Fallschirmjagers 90 should be brought in through those TPz Fuchs for 10 points. Remove Legionary 90 and replace with a mistral team, they are stat wise inferior to the PZG 90. You can get away with using the rest with the exception of Jagers... replace they're transport with M113... theyre cheap and very good...  Recon - Replace the Commando para transport with a VAB (no 20mm) these will be your scout teams on the front line, the German SF is fine, remember your putting them behind enemy lines... not infront.  USA-   Infantry - change the Light Rifleman 90 in the UH-60 with a stinger C team in an M113. Get Rifleman 90 in M113 upvetted (ATM your rifleman cost more then your Marine 90), also while many people hate it, replace your one marine card with Deltas in V-150s... While they arnt great... theyre cheap and quite potent...  Recon- Seals need to go into V-150s no ifs or buts... Rangers are fine. remove the UH-1 Heavy hog and get an other cheap optic unit, the US has the M151 MUT, a very good optic unit at 25 points and a 45 point one with exception, get the exceptional version."
wargame,3ajod1,a_grated_monkey,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:10:42 2015 UTC,I would say put the Commandos Para in VAB T20/13s to add extra firepower.
wargame,3ajod1,Aeweisafemalesheep,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:28:16 2015 UTC,"Usa - check over the last few weeks of the deck thread to bring the USA deck up to par. If you want to play 1v1/2v2 then you can keep upvet rifle90 in a helo. For 3v3/4v4 i would not helo rush like that. Beyond that, the past disucssions should make you aware of the needed unit composition.    RD - I would stay away from the RD deck until you have a handle on playing USSR. The deck can be quirky and will be punishing in bigger games. The faction is unique in the fact that the best deck to play is Red Dragon motorized.    Eurocorp - logi - drop the supply helo, turn those 3 points into a recon mistral unit. inf - FSJ90 should go into the 20 point helo and become your all around SF unit or they should be in a fuchs for later in the game. Panzergrens should go in marder2 or a 5point transport so you can pump them easily. For the milan f3, just cheap out with a 5 pointer. Jager, downvet them and take them in a fuchs or 5 point transport. COnsider sappers for city fights. Support - Gepard a2 might be playable in a small game, otherwise go for the 55 pointer.  You NEED crotale for anti helo. 4 card of AA can be played by picking up a mistral truck. Otherwise check out the deck from my newbie thread (and the other thread it links to) for arty/aa composition ideas. tank - this composition could work for a smaller game. Recon - you have FSJ90 in a helo, then you can drop the para's helo. Veh - itow and hot platforms are in general a waste of money. There is a tow2 Wiesel. helo - you need a dedicated aa helo that is cost effective and the celtic does that. Plane - You're lacking one huge element, ATGM. These are a must. If you want two ASF's then you can always play a card of elite mirage 2000 RDI."

wargame,3ajod1,Aeweisafemalesheep,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:34:55 2015 UTC,It won't and more importantly from the composition you would be fielding in that you don't understand what an armored deck is supposed to do. So show me a standard CW or USA or your best blufor deck and lets see what you know. Because it's very possible to have a tank oriented (4 or 5 card tank) deck.
wargame,3ajod1,PrinceDeTolly,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:22:42 2015 UTC,"With that deck you aren't getting much out of your tank superiority. You are playing as one of the top tank coalitions, use the advantage well and don't waste spaces on crappy low tier tanks that don't benefit much from veterency. By that I mean drop everything below the Leopard AS1+ and replace it all with challenger mk.2s and mk.3s.   To cover this heavy tank blob, you need better AA. I think you should swap out the chieftan marksman for the challenger version, swap the howitzers for the non radar rapiers, and add in a card of falcons for cheap AA on the move. You also should drop the sea harrier and add the tornado F2 and F3 for a good ASF force. To pay for those in points, you can drop one of the AVREs, the chimeras (challenger mk.2s do the same thing better), and the I-tow and bushranger since they are pretty bad units.   Commonwealth armor is pretty hard to play, especially against an air heavy soviet player, but if you micro your AA well enough you should do just fine. Just don't expect it to do that well in a competitive match."

wargame,3ajod1,Aeweisafemalesheep,2,Thu Jun 25 01:32:22 2015 UTC,"Solid work there. logi - you only need the hemit. Get a 100 point command jeep. Or cheap out on the helo and go command tank for contestable zones. You've got interesting choices here. inf - you don't have any fodder, at all. Trade the bradleyrifle since you already have recce bradley and Get rifle90 in m113a3 to help you play forests or spam into cities.  Downvet the stingers so you can saturate. Lacking light rifle 90 upvet will hurt you on some maps. They combo well in places with other us units and give a bit of meat to a seal open that would get decimated by btr80/90 in the open. I would not upvet the smaw so you can keep pumping the lvtpa1 in case of meat grinder. Support - Downvet the chaps and use them in pairs. LAvmortars aren't the most amazing at doing damage. Paladin or 107mm will actually kill things or finish them off. For 203's you want to use down vet 70 pointers so you can get a critical mass and heavily damage or anhiliate things with a single, alpha strike. tank - fine Recon - Understand that the longbow is not a primary source of eyes, it's recon points into an atgm platform. You may want a cheap kiwoa or lower tier exceptional kiowa. Recon cobra has utility too.  veh and helo are fine. Don't ignore cheap cobra and ontos though. DAPS can scout flanks and rushes (solid optics rating) for you early on. Good choice. Plane - No reason to upvet a napalm bomber. A-ten's are sketchy for atgm duty, they, like the nighthawk are the second choice after the super hornet which is a need because it will kill t90's in 1 pass. The rest is fine. The wild weasel is a nice alternative to the prowler."

wargame,3ajod1,Aeweisafemalesheep,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:51:03 2015 UTC,Deal 1-2 blocks of damage to a t90 before going for an NH strike. The 120 harrier isn't bad although it's not amazing either. You can get two upvet and attempt side shots.
wargame,3ajod1,Straya8,2,Thu Jun 25 03:02:49 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/lfatnqc.jpg  This is my general purpose US deck. Serves me well for the majority of the games I play which are usually 10v10's but also thrives in smaller matches. My play style is usually themed around Armored pushes hence the 5 cards of tanks. But besides that I don't really have any problems at all with it, just after some critiquing by my fellow wargamers."
wargame,3ajod1,potato_delusions,4,Sat Jun 20 22:46:39 2015 UTC,Some quick pointers:  Inf: Always take 5 cards with an unspec deck. Get some stinger Cs.  Support: I would take a PIVADs in the place of the second Chap.
wargame,3ajod1,wigglefish,2,Sun Jun 21 01:02:20 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty sweet. I'd kill... probably the mbt70 in favor of a fifth recon: 70 pt exc. heli, 55 pt cobra or else something wheeled and cheap.

wargame,3ajod1,Eurasian-HK,2,Sun Jun 21 23:28:23 2015 UTC,"If you mainly play 10 vs 10 these are the changes I would recommend.    LOG - No supply truck? Swap Chinook for HEMIT, you won't need anything else and it is hands down the best supply vehicle available to Blufor. Swap Command Jeep for Command Infantry in either an amphibious transport or helicopter. Command infantry aren't able to be destroyed in random cluster arty attacks. INFANTRY - Interesting choices, no comment if this works for you.  SUPPORT - You don't need Paladin and ATACMS, drop one for mortars.  TANKS - Down vet the M1A2. Too many tanks for my taste but whatever floats your boat.  RECON - Swap Navy Seals to wheeled V-150 transport & Rangers to a Blackhawk. Add LAV-25 Recon and remove the one from the Vehicle tab.  VEHICLE - Drop LAV-25, the recon version is better and the same price. HELO - DAP is all you need. Drop Supercobra.  PLANE - Decent selection but I find Nighthawk and D-Eagle redundant, swap one out for F-4S Phantom II Napalm bomber.

wargame,3ajod1,Eurasian-HK,3,Sun Jun 21 00:22:43 2015 UTC,"From looking at your deck I am going to guess you are fairly new to this game.   1st off Canada isn't very competitive in this game. You are only going to hamstring yourself playing as Canada. If you really want to play Canada I would recommend you make a NORAD or Commonwealth deck.   Comments to make this deck a little better;  You don't need 2 cards of Supply Helicopters. Highlanders are crap for the price, take the Eryx fire support team instead. Canadian Airborne should be in a wheeled transport. You're missing the Wolverine AA unit in the support tab. Too much helicopter borne recon. 25pt cougar is a waste of time, might as well take the recon version.   Again you should make a NORAD or Commonwealth deck."

Drop the LAV-TUA, take the ILTIS TOW 2. The Chimera can stay   Helos:   Drop the CH-135 Keep the CH-118 as a reserve.    Planes: Fine"

wargame,3ajod1,Jharec,3,Sun Jun 21 03:48:52 2015 UTC,"That's already a pretty balanced deck. Twisp already gave good suggestions,  I don't have to add much more:   For a command tank, you have the choice between the FFC Centurion and the STRIPBV 90, both having the 2 top armor that is important vs cluster munition. I like the latter more, because it is more mobile. I'd personally upvet both AA and ATGM infantry. You want to make sure of those hits. Also, the RBS 90 is a good choice as well, because of its range. In recon, I'd go with the AS.350 over the Cayuse, because of speed and health points."
wargame,3ajod1,Futski,2,Sun Jun 21 09:02:19 2015 UTC,I generally agree with the others. But consider taking the Jægere 90 out of the Lynx and into the Jupiter to keep their price down.

wargame,3ajod1,Twisp56,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:57:37 2015 UTC,"I would use the danish centurion cv as my tank cv, it's better armored than the M48. RoBotSystem-90 is better than  the danish Stinger I think. 2.8 range is always worth it, 5-man squad too. If you are willing to lose the wheels you could put the Stormere in NM-135. You get the cannon for a very low price. The 70 point TOW-2 vehicle is overpriced IMO. If anything take the TOW-2 jeep. F-16AM is in fact (very) slightly better than the Gripen, but if I had to choose, I would still go for the coolnes of Gripen."
wargame,3ajod1,gfgmalty,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:28:35 2015 UTC,Is the range on the RBS-90 worth the loss in accuracy? I went with the stingers for 70% vs RBS-90 with 55%

wargame,3ajod1,Jharec,2,Sun Jun 21 09:18:01 2015 UTC,"Heya, took a look over your deck. Here's what I found:  LOG   Consider taking one of the T72 command tanks instead of the wheeled command for improved protection against cluster munitions, bombs and arty.   INF   MotSchützen are a solid choice, I'd take two cards though, one in a 5 pt transport and the other in bmp2s for some autocannon support. You could loose the SPG9-D for them. GROM AA is solid, but consider LStR 40 in a wheeled transport instead for a solid initial deployment.   SUP   Way too much Radar AA here, especially since there are good other choices. I'd ditch the east-german Shilka for the Czech Strop 2, which is non-radar, fast and amazing. Also, two cards of ROMB feel excessive, given that you also take Fla-SFL 256. In general, three cards of AA should be enough. In addition, I'd Ondavas for precision artying.   TNK   Looking good   REC   I'd take Formoza over the Specialni for their grenade launchers. They're good as assault inf.   VHC   Flame tanks are a solid choice. I'd keep an eye on wether you are actually using them during fights though.   HELO   NSWP gets two very nice Helos, the DHS Mi-24P with its AA capabilities, and the Mi-25 S-24 with the 240mm rockets. There is no excuse not to take them.   AIR   You're lacking SEAD, which should be escorting your bombers, soaking missiles with its high ECM I'd take the excellent MiG-25RBF over the MiG-23BN."
wargame,3ajod1,HillbillySnowman,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:30:06 2015 UTC,I took most of your advice and have come up with a revised version. http://i.imgur.com/xlfdEia.jpg I don't know if I'm missing AA now but i never used the high end AA in my deck anyway. Decided to keep the spg9-d as they give me good long range transport and tank destruction but replaced the grom and kommandosi with more MotSchützen and the LSTR 40. Dropped a tank as I never used them anyway and my t55's have basically the same stats. Added in a SEAD plane and changed the bombers but I might change back if facing an armoured deck so I can halt advances easily. Dropped the konkurs and added in the MI-25. Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated Thanks
wargame,3ajod1,potato_delusions,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:32:19 2015 UTC,Inf: SPG-9s aren't worth it IMO. I would swap the Moto 90 in the Mt-lb for a Spw-70/80.   Sup: I would get the Newa over the Romb.
wargame,3ajod1,Jharec,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:47:30 2015 UTC,"Looking like a pretty solid deck! I think you have plenty AA. I'd even consider upvetting the LStr40 so they get an accuracy bonus. That's always a good idea with good-accuracy, low-amount-of-rounds units. Otherwise, just play with it, see how it feels."
wargame,3ajod1,Aeweisafemalesheep,2,Sun Jun 21 11:58:29 2015 UTC,"Logi - I think the polish 150 speed river crosser is cheaper. And with that you can trade the inf's transport for a helo or you can just cheap out on the car and use a 100 pointer. inf - lstr-40 in btr80, ditto that for a card of mot90, a second card of mot90, spg9 are awful, if you want AT use konkurs/m otherwise get yourself some fodder with cz reservists or moto.  Don't forget that polish get a 10 point transport. And make sure that when picking transports like mtlb or btr70 that you don't take a quantity hit. It's an issue that was never resolved, so you might want to use a different transport. Support - utter nonsense. The reason this faction is played is for the strop-2 and in many instances the spoel. Want to do 45 point osa+tor in addition to strop2 for like a 2v2? That's fine too.  wheeled newa is  a great choice for big maps.  Tank - trade the dyna for a wilkm2 or twardy Recon - Specialni's are helo flank worthy. Trade the eger trash for a card of formoza in a 10 pointer. helo - you may want the air to air hind, otherwise the CZ hind is perfect for support fire with its stupidly huge rockets. Plane - For a bomber the eger have 2 options, mig17's with 250's to deploy a wave of them with the quantity 5 they give you or the mig that can carpet bomb. CZ has a 1000kg bomber that does alright but the low ecm is a killer. Get a SEAD aircraft in there. IF you want to run 5 card air you can go 2x sead. For ATGM plane you want the seria with its long range."
wargame,3ajod1,Paladin_G,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:12:56 2015 UTC,"Rate my Red Dragons Motorized Deck: http://i.imgur.com/83I8jhE.jpg  It's intended to take ground and support breakthroughs by other players with cheap and flexible deployments in Conquest game modes. Extra recon is there to plug holes, while tanks and vehicles hold long sightlines. Lots of cheaper infantry to make towns a tarpit to get through.   Had some questions about my infantry tab, though. I originally had Juckwidae reservists, but swapped them out for Bochongsu, thinking they would be better for the extra morale, DPS, and LMG for just five points more. Should I keep the Bochongsu or take the reservists instead?   Also, if I had to sacrifice an infantry card for Li Jian 90, which should it be?"
wargame,3ajod1,Aeweisafemalesheep,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:19:00 2015 UTC,"Oh your god, yes, yes you do want reservists. You don't need cheap men for killing other men. What you do need is constant recon by fire, fodder, and tools to apply presure that make up for where your buddies will be weak and those reservists in their zippy hello kitty car do it. And they keep doing it for the whole game. Base LJ are the unit you probably want for city fighting while you can keep a card of yuck for where you would put vdv90 or in an open to hit a forest like you would with gru. Also, you can get flamers in a 10point nk transport. Might be handy for some situations. Infantry aside, Logi - drop that shitty supply helo and grab an infantry command. Support -  I'd actually take pongae 2 for the range. It could stun a plane before it drops or atgm's. It's a big could but it's a could that counts.  A BM-21 or two could actually soften up a place before you hit it. Tank - They're all so/so at best. These choices are just utility. Your real tank cannon power is in recon and veh. Recon - Type63 is a nimble little thing. BTR-40a can be played to be a flank guard of sorts. If you want men in a helo the only decent choice for a side drop would be the leiren in the z9a. ZTQ-62 upvet has just enough accuracy to do something in specific situations. Veh -  PTZ-59 is a solid hitter and should replace your ats103. helo - fine Plane - be aware of the F-7B which can be thrown at longbows and apaches for potential 1 pass kills that trade exceptionally well."
wargame,3ajod1,Paladin_G,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:59:37 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the input, thank you kindly.   The Only reason I took ATS-103 in the vehicle tab over PT-59 is for that ROF. They have good HE a and 10rpm, a good anti-transport/anti-infantry option on the cheap. I already I have 2 cards of PTZ-89 so I figured they would be a good, low-cost support option."
wargame,3ajod1,Aeweisafemalesheep,2,Sun Jun 21 20:19:47 2015 UTC,The 103 dies to a sneeze and costs too much for a support fire weapon. You can grab a couple of recon tanks if you just want to put shells out on soft targets. The 59 has 18AP so a pair of those can cost effectively punch up and also duke it out with other mid tier options. Drop the ZSU and you can roll with both. You already have a ton of auto cannons for support fire even if you just grab one set of dudes with btr80a and tanke85 in wz551.

Use an American deck rather than a generalized BluFor one.   Log: You don't need that many command units. Use 1 card that suits your purposes, a command jeep or APC will suffice. Take a card of supply trucks, and a FOB. The community has mixed feelings about the utility of 65pt supply choppers.   Inf: Take Rifleman 90 in either the 5 point M113 or one of the Bradleys. The former keeps your Rifles 90 as cheap spam, the latter gives you a great IFV. Rifles 90 in Humvees are fragile and more expensive than they need to be.   Take the Stinger C, always. The accuracy is worth it.   Marines should almost always be in the LVTP7A1. That grenade launcher is tops for stunning and killing infantry and supporting your Marines.   You'd probably be better off taking a second card of Marines than Assault Engineers.   I'll let other commenters handle the rest."

Take British SAS for brilliant manpands, maybe another card of Ghurkas in place of the Javelins. Put the Canadian rifles in the IFV (the TH something or other), still cheap+autocannon. Or Switch the Rifles out with Canadian Airborne 75 in cheap wheeled transports.   Sup: Find space in your deck for another ADA option, be it a Stormer HVM or more Rapiers. You have too little ADA.   Tank: Lose those Canadian Leopard C1s. Between the Chally 2, Chally 1 Mk2, Mexas, and Chieftain, you have enough tanks. You don't need to squander another 3 activation points on some mediocre 40-point tanks.   Recon: Plenty more options there. Get some more exceptional optics units.   Vic: I'd replace the FV-102 with that Anzac truck with the 105mm cannon on it.   Helo: Not many choices here. Lynx 3 is overpriced but hellfires and AA are still good. Just don't expect them to win head-to-head with other AA choppers.   Plane: You're using Commonwealth. Take an F-111C for Christ's sake."
wargame,3ajod1,Aeweisafemalesheep,0,Sun Jun 21 19:50:33 2015 UTC,"Not bad at all. logi - drop the warrior, the IFV commands are pretty cost ineffective. You can get a command chieftain for soaking up damage or you can get 100 point command cars. Get  the supply truck instead of helos, iirc the canadian proto or mankati should be fine. inf - SASR are one of the least cost effective inf in the game (great job eugen for unneeded changes!) so just get another card of gurkha90. You can upvet both if you want too. Canadian rifles aren't so hot. If you want inf try out diggers90 since their lmg is pretty good. If you need inf to do city combat try out the pios and put them in bison. Support - Bison mortars are over priced and you don't have any max range anti helo. Trade them for stormers. Tank - If you want a low end tank take a look at the mk5 cheftain. Otherwise for power take a look at leo c2 or as1+ Replace the mk2 and mk11 with cheftain mk3. They'll at least be of some use in bigger games. Recon - British exceptional recce helo is a must. Try out the aslav25's for armed recon, you can use the stealth rating to dish out some damage. Veh - Replace the striker with iltis tow2 Helo -   fine. Plane - Replace the jaguar with ANZAC's Kahu for an effective atgm platform."

I don't really count on them REC - maxed out this category since there are so many good choices / Mandatory recon chopper / 2 cards of Formozas, 1 in helos, 1 in transports / Same with Specialni Jetnotkys / 2 cards of Specialaufklären for flank or forward scouting / Helos recons could go with a sneaky helo forces, since everything is available to do that VHC - mostly fillers here.

wargame,3ajod1,WG_Theo,2,Wed Jun 24 11:07:07 2015 UTC,"mech' CCCP   I am not entirely sure what you try to do with this deck. It has a lot of infantry, but the infantry you have is ineffective and with the transport options you choose it also is so overpriced it is inefficient. You will be out-infantried by a standard deck with better troops in cheaper transports.  The only thing that leaves you with is a bunch of IVFs. But frankly these are normally used as supporting elements and not the core of a strategy. You would seem to lack the superheavy (or indeed any dynamic counter to a superheavy) to enable pushes, and you are not really quick either.  Also there is a bunch of helicopters in here. Yet it seems questionable to use a mechanized deck for a heli-centric strategy either. And importantly, you lack the most powerful Soviet helicopters for such a strategy, like the KA-52, the MI-28 and most importantly the MI-24V. Right now you are pretty helpless against AA helis."

The Motostřelci should be in OT-62A, if it's not possible in a mot deck just replace them with something that has a cheaper transport, or replace them with Granátomet AGS-17. Also replace the FallschirmJägerBatallion-40 with LuftSTurmRegiment-40, FJB's shitty weapons aren't worth the precious Hind transport. Tanks: T-55AM Merida could be useful for some cheap fire support, but the DYNA is good too. Recon: All those Spezialaufklärer are rather useless compared to other recon infantry in this deck. Průzkumníci are better IMO, maybe one card of Průzkumníci and one card of T-55 to replace the Spezialaufklärer. Vehicle: TO-55 can be useful in certain situations. The BRDM-2 Konkurs is overpriced. Helo: DHS Hind is a much better AA helo than Sokol - faster, armored, more hp, good ATGMs.You could ditch the W-3W without replacement or add another DHS. Air: Not what I would use.

I posted about cw in this thread and that feedback highlights  how to make a general deck. You're making some typical  newbie mistakes like upveting low quantity high tier units like chally 2 or kahu. In general you upvet high quantity solutions like 40 to 100 point tanks. Veh units. Recon aslav25. There is a lot more to it than that  but this works as starting logic that won't stress you to read the game like code of the matrix.

Commonwealth manpads are meh, due to lacking range and guided. Only worthwhile one are SAS ADATAs cant hit for days. Long-range AA is better served by the Stormer. I would skip the Tracked Rapier. Story of CW: little decent AA. Chally Marksman can at least move, the Centurion is a static turret.  No upvetting Chally 2s, Kahu or Sea Harrier. 4 armor cards is a bit heavy. Would take a Mexas but cut Centurion and maybe ASI+. Lynx 3 is a bastard that is too costly for a AA chopper or ATGM platform. Simply take the 75 pointer ATGM and forget about heli-borne AA. (CW can not into AA). Try to compensate your lacking AA with fighters. Eurofighter and the Tornado F2(?, the one where you can get 2 elites). No upvetting Kahu.

Im technically trading slightly better Launcher for a shittier MG? Might as well use Kutei...  An other example would LANDJUT... Cry, cause we all know Fallschirmjagers Laugh at the Shittier FKP.  Finally Commonwealth... Cry, all they're SF is bad. SASR vs Royal marines? Same price... but statistically Royal marines have better everything in terms of weaponry... But why would you be using royal marines 90? You have Ghurkas...  But in terms of FSK vs FKP, it really makes no sense.

wargame,3ajhnk,Sanguinary_Guard,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:46:30 2015 UTC,"Well, spetz and gru and vdv 90 combo is even more broken then Scandi inf though. All shock inf has battle rifles and elites use assault rifles (beside limited recon elites with smg). The mg3 is not awesome enough to fully compensate and spetz in towns still beats Scandi inf (which sacrifices giod long range IR aa and good gunship and aa helicopters). Most people just don't know how to play NSWP or Russian inf, but they are on par with Scandi in normal battles (where you don't need 60+ squads of inf).   2he/10 rpm would not be game breaking good and 19 or 21 ap with 10 rpm is also not enough to deal with bmpt (Although with make an awesome partnership with kustjagere 90).   It depends on how good the fire support Carl gustav m2 is made whether it will be op."
wargame,3ajhnk,frankwouter,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:45:09 2015 UTC,"Ok so I actually sat down and thought about it. It's wouldn't be as game breaking as I first assumed (infantry that hard counters both infantry and vehicles). Still I don't think it's necessary for Scandinavia to have them. They have some of the best shock and SF as well as some good line inf with great transports. If they were going to get buffs anywhere it should be in the helicopter department which could use something with rocket pods or stinger missiles.   Overall though they are in a good spot. They have a good tank tab (not the best but certainly not the worst) good support (not the greatest aa but best mortar and heavy arty) great infantry tab, great Air tab, they lack in good vehicles but have great ifvs so it's usually not an issue, and not that great helicopter (fennec tow 2 and 20 mm aren't bad but aren't enough)  Right now though if any coalition should be buffed it should be commonwealth and maybe a minor one for red dragons to make them a bit more popular (still pretty good though)"

wargame,3ajhnk,frankwouter,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"Scandinavia would still have the helicopter aa issue, but rbs 90 spam and some trickery vs ka 52 make it workable.   Commonwealth needs some solid anti plane aa with 3.5 km + range and acceptable mobility. It really can't support an attack with expensive stormers, useless adats, slow rapiers and radar marksmen.   An 8 stinger c lynx would still be weak, because ty fighters 1 shot it, but it could work with the right price."

wargame,3ajhnk,frankwouter,0,Sun Jun 21 19:20:37 2015 UTC,Kustjagere 90 though. Creates the same issue as spetz and vdv 90 but worse.  And eryx fire support spam also works as he vs inf in 2 or larger stacks.
wargame,3ajhnk,jayman9696,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:46:36 2015 UTC,"Uh yes, but Kustjägere 90 cost 50 pts for one unit in amfiebilar.  Do Eryx FIST teams work well in forests? I've been trying a little with CG M3 teams, but they usually do very unimpressively, is that because of the minimum range?"
wargame,3ajhnk,ural_idiotic,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:52:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, the other fire supports have a min range vs inf.  Fire support eryx has no min range and stuns with 1 or 2 missile hits. It is really anoying when you have to a attack into them. An 80 points quadstack just destroys anything you trow at them. They do become much worse when panicked and miss when stunned because they are guided. So combine with jager spam to have some meatshields.  Also, kustjagere 90 kills a bmpt head on on a forest with 5-10 men surviving. It's doomzooka has 0 aim time, allowing scoot and shooting. 1 or 2 make your forest force much stronger, especially if you run jagers or stormers as main inf."

Your prob thinking of the Mig-29 Fulcrum or the Shilkas which were given to MOST PACT nations by the time the iron curtain fell.  Recon infantry are generally inferior to they're normal shock counterparts for balancing reasons. Also all recon infantry have very good optics for 15-20 points at best... Which is compared to the 50-75 points you have to spend on that regularly...   Most PACT nations were given half assed or shitty hand me downs or watered down with the exception of east Germany and Bulgaria which were given the almost watered down version of everything.

Many professional analysts object to the term wargames as this is generally taken to be referring to the civilian hobby, thus the preference for the term simulation.  Simulations exist in many different forms, with varying degrees of realism. In recent times, the scope of simulations has widened to include not only military but also political and social factors, which are seen as inextricably entwined in a realistic warfare model.  Whilst many governments make use of simulation, both individually and collaboratively, little is known about it outside professional circles. Yet modelling is often the means by which governments test and refine their military and political policies. Military simulations are seen as a useful way to develop tactical, strategical and doctrinal solutions, but critics argue that the conclusions drawn from such models are inherently flawed, due to the approximate nature of the models used.

Singleplayer in this game is shit and won't prepare you for multiplayer other than letting you get use to the controls a bit. All the AI does is blob units. In the new player lobby you can find some people that will help you build a deck and practice it with other new people.
wargame,3afk6u,DevTad,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:10:49 2015 UTC,"Ignore singleplayer, instead befriend someone who plays the game and play with them, using teamspeak, skype or mumble. If you play with an experienced player you will be a useful teammate in about 4-5 games. Also host the games yourself - allowing you to control the quality of the game. Take a look at the profile of people who join and bear in mind you can reset your stats so be wary of people with single digit games but > 50% wins. Make your own deck, I recommend landjut as an easy starting coalition as they don't have too many units to confuse you. They also have the otomatic, which will run redfors day when properly managed.

I'm not sure how familiar you are with the wargame series but it's known for being a pretty complex game that takes a while to get a good handle of to really be a competent player. This is why we have the 200 page guide of wargame red dragon on the side bar. There are also quite a few video tutorials as I understand. Then some other people here have linked to some deck building threads/videos. Start there to learn what is what and get all the basics down.  Single player is great to learn the controls and what different units actually are. But the AI is brain dead so once you have that down you are not really going to learn anything by playing it. That's when you should hop on multiplayer. Join a few lobbies that say noob only or make your own. The reddit team speak also offers training I think."

wargame,3aehf9,russianjudgealski,2,Fri Jun 19 13:44:23 2015 UTC,"The main thing is that Spado's are more versatile, as they have rocket launchers that are capable of harming more heavily armored opponents, while Niebieskie are more specialized for infantry killing in towns and forests.  My personal preference is the Spado's, because you have other troops (such as the excellent Saperzy Stzurmowi) who can do the infantry killing, but without the Spado's rocket launcher your infantry presents no credible threat to enemy armor."
wargame,3aehf9,Raventhefuhrer,2,Fri Jun 19 15:04:41 2015 UTC,Don't Spado's come in the deadly Mi-17 too? Like I remember Berety have meh transports.
wargame,3aehf9,Drahos,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:18:08 2015 UTC,Berety are worthless.  Compare the berety to base spado. You get 50% more hp and puny 3 ap more and the same anti-inf damage for a 66% price hike. A terrible deal.  Spado Base versus Spado 90 is closer but I like my general purpose infantry to carry a good at weapon are are willing to pay 5pts for it. I would consider a low-at infantry as 3rd or 4th combat infantry card.  Seen that way you get two good deals going from berety 90 to spado 90.
wargame,3aehf9,Destruct1,2,Fri Jun 19 15:54:25 2015 UTC,Sturm saps also make a much better anti inf unit.
wargame,3aehf9,frankwouter,0,Fri Jun 19 16:29:18 2015 UTC,"About 10 vs 15 men squads in general.   15 men squads have some upsides, like being more survive (heal them) and mostly, not dying to light bombs.   But the damage output is the same (except a slightly faster reload on rifles) and they cost more, making them usually a bad choice."
wargame,3aehf9,frankwouter,3,Fri Jun 19 14:17:30 2015 UTC,"Actually they cost the same since Niebieskie '90 are discounted 5pts for not having an upper level RPG, the only difference is the RPG and mancount in between the two. Poland as a nation has shit RPGs all around and it's not really a problem if you stick to your strength in urban combat. I'd actually suggest the OP take Niebieskie '75 for their shock support since it comes at a higher availability, has the better RPK with more supression, and only trades for a slightly worse RPG than what they already had upgraded. If motoshutzen didn't exist it would be one of the most cost effective REDFOR inf options."

Furthermore, the Red Dragon multiplayer community is on the verge of death as it is, so it's unlikely you'll ever be able to get an EE multiplayer match unless it's against Lord von Pwnz0rz who's played EE for years and will stomp you.

The inclusion of planes and boats were horribly implemented in the sequels anyway, and EE had the best maps and more interesting units that weren't just constant cut and paste and fluff.  It was much more targeted and focused, and felt a lot more geniune, like a proper coalition of super powers and their allies, rather than akward as hell juggling of balance so countries with weak militaries composed of lackluster troops and hand-me-down equipment could stand toe-to-toe with super power militaries with cutting edge tech and crack troops in open conventional battle.  To be frank, I hope the next wargame, if it ever comes, returns to it's roots. On a side note, it's also got the best campaign."

They're just lame panic-button call ins like Company of Heroes. They feel so tacked on and out of place, especially when Wargame foregoes ground-based CIWS and more robust AA gameplay in favor of just throwing everything on a hotkey and tapping a box. There's no nuance, no micro, not depth. It feels like something that detracts from the game, not content that improves it.  The modern warfare mod for world in conflict was how aircraft in a game like Wargame is handled -right-."

wargame,3ah13e,Twisp56,2,Sat Jun 20 19:37:55 2015 UTC,"AA isn't that strong, not by a longshot. Neither are aircraft. The whole point to the game was combined arms, and not just rushing all your shit forward in a big, retarded formation like you do in wargame. It required actually forethought in positioning, and moving together as a UNIT, not just as a reckless gaggle. SEAD defeats AA, off-map strikes defeat AA, infantry infiltration(Which was fairly easy to do and required active defense of rear-lines unlike in Wargame because special forces actually serve a point aside from just being 'lol stonger infantry'.) defeats AA and artillery.  Tank sections also got access to CIWS that defeats all plane-based munitions except for cluster bombs. They also got access to light and medium-AA escorts to help keep AA off of them. Everyone also got access to AA infantry. It's next to impossible to get spawn camped unless you were asleep at the wheel or truly had no idea what you were doing. It was a true teamwork game, and trying to YOLO it like you're playing Wargame would get you smashed because the units had actual depth to them, they demanded actual attention and control, and required you to understand how they worked and how best to employ them instead of just right clicking a point at the map and leaving them there for 20 minutes while patting yourself on the back for being so awesome at RTS games."

wargame,3adrpx,Futski,3,Sat Jun 20 01:33:01 2015 UTC,"This is a tactical warfare game, not strategical.  It's the same reason why paratroopers don't jump out of transport planes either.  The SR-71 and U-2 were used to take pictures of weapons facilities behind enemy lines, not inform soldiers on the ground about close troop movements, only in Call of Duty Black Ops."
wargame,3adrpx,zman122333,4,Fri Jun 19 11:25:47 2015 UTC,"What could be cool is an AWACS class of aircraft.  When you have your AWACS up, it could increase the accuracy of missiles by a given percentage or increase ECM for friendly planes."

wargame,3adrpx,fatrefrigerator,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:21:50 2015 UTC,"I think an code-breaking unit would be cool, see where the enemy is placing new units. Could be used to prepare for reinforcements or vice-versa, to bluff a wave of reinforcements."
wargame,3adrpx,ProfessionalXMAZ,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:31:33 2015 UTC,"Right, like another post says, U2 and SR71 are strategic reconnaissance planes...the equivalent in the tactical setting of RD would be like Forward Air Controllers or something, but imo a low/slow aircraft would kinda be fucked with all the AA in the game.  We do have our recon helos"
wargame,3adrpx,polarisdelta,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:17:50 2015 UTC,"Realism and scale of engagement is important but it isn't the real reason.  The real reason is that Eugen was actually able to recognize a potential problem and steer around it for once, namely that everyone would want to open with a recon plane and some bomb trucks in hopes of wrecking the enemy's start sector, which would in turn set off and arms race of air defense at the start of the game. It would also further enable sitzkrieg to pass a cheap recon plane over the enemy and then just plink with 200mm guns."
wargame,3adrpx,Rafter-man,0,Sat Jun 20 17:08:16 2015 UTC,"If we did have them they would be pretty un realistic and I have no idea if planes like this are ever used on a modern battlefield, but you could balance them pretty easily A 60pt low end spy plane might only be able to view bulky and slow ground forces, while just keeping out side low end man pad and AA range. You could use slower planes that get down to like less than 600kph, and for I dunno a high end Nato reconnaissance jet might cost 160. It could have a high ecm, still a slower than usual speed maybe around 900kph keeping out of SPAAA fire and mid range radar guided SAM's with a wide turning circle, with a optics range able to detect most poor- medium- good (in bigger numbers) stealth, that aren't in any sort of cover. They would preform poorly against fighters jets and long range missile fighters like the Mig-31 or the F-14 tomcat would be its biggest problems."

wargame,3aa3j7,Jarand4,9,Sun Jun 21 01:59:08 2015 UTC,I always spend a good 10-15 minutes admiring the beauty that is main chat before playing a game. There is nothing on the Internet like it. Several dozen people all trolling each other and thinking they are doing an amazing job of it.  I am tempted to jump in and stir things up but I feel any attempt at irony or self awareness will be completely lost on them.

Its nice to debate with people about why so and so unit is better when employed like this or put up against this. Also some good political discussions, as about 95% of people in the community have more than a few brain cells in their heads, so some intellectual conversation isnt that hard to come across when the message board is being it's usual self.  But then somone comes along and starts talking about the Holocaust or African Americans and the whole thing is ruined. But thats wargame for you"

wargame,3aaacd,russianjudgealski,6,Thu Jun 18 13:55:41 2015 UTC,"It's multiplicative, not additive (sadly). That is, a 16% accuracy boost on a unit with 30%.accuracy won't yield you 46% acc (30 + 16) but rather 34.8% (30 + 16% of 30)"
wargame,3aaacd,Unicide,7,Thu Jun 18 14:05:32 2015 UTC,"(sadly)   Quite sensibly. Otherwise high rof units would be crazily buffed, e.g. smg infantry or Afghanistankis."
wargame,3aaacd,WG_Theo,2,Thu Jun 18 14:10:23 2015 UTC,"... but it also creates a confusing dynamic where high acc units benefit much, much more from vet than low acc. units. Which is counterintuitive because we tend to vet the cheap, plentiful units but not the expensive, scarce ones"
wargame,3aaacd,wigglefish,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:47:15 2015 UTC,"Depends equally if not more on the ROF. I haven't done the math but high rof/ high availability units gains tons of ""kills pr coin"" as well."
wargame,3aaacd,Haerverk,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:13:43 2015 UTC,"Well 4 cheap, inaccurate tanks will probably yield the same number of hits as 1 expensive tank."
wargame,3aaacd,Cross88,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:20:48 2015 UTC,"Nope. All unit benefit equally. You will always get a x% increase in DPS, irrespective of the base accuracy.  The reason we upvet mainly low accuracy units is that the availability on them does not hurt as much."
wargame,3aaacd,WG_Theo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:28:55 2015 UTC,I disagree. It seems to matter much less the difference between 15-19% hit than 60-75%.
wargame,3aaacd,wigglefish,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:02:13 2015 UTC,"But, but... it's basic math, not a matter of agreement.  Your 15% unit might have been a bad damage dealer anyway. But still, its damage per second will be buffed by by just as much as the 'better' unit.  Example:   Suppose the first unit has a base accuracy of 15% and a rate of fire of 1000 rmp (just for the sake of the argument). So it deals 150 hits per minute. Suppose the 60% accuracy unit has a rate of fire of 100 rpm, so it deals 60 hits per minute. Unbuffed the second unit deals 2.5 more damage. If you buff them, both accuracies go up by (say) 27% (i.e. 15->19, and 60->75%). This means the hits per minute go up to 190 an 75 respectively. But that is still means the one unit is exactly 2.5 times better than the other.   You could however say that some of the low-accuracy units are really bad at dealing damage anyway, the only point being to absorb damage to let other units continue the fight. That would certainly be true, but not mainly due to the accuracy, but to the overall balance of costs, armor/HP and damage dealt (rof, accuracy, HE/AP)."
wargame,3aaacd,WG_Theo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:38:07 2015 UTC,"It matters to me much more whether my kyu-maru hits first vs. T90 than my hachi-nana hitting first on a passing wz-551. Maybe I am comparing specific units to their vetted cousins rather than high vs low tier units but I don't think so.   A unit that does game changing amounts of damage doing significantly more damage is important. A unit that does little damage still doing little damage is less so. If I were spamming numbers of low tier units maybe it comes out in the wash, but I'm not. Rarely do I send five Nana-yon A to do work that might have been done by a kyu-maru. In that case, the math may help each set of units equally.   I just think bigger differences in gameplay are made the closer you can get super units to 100% tohit."
