AskNYC,3e40tt,gpsrx,8,Tue Jul 21 20:01:33 2015 UTC,"NYC co-op board president here.  What we look for in an application package is assurance that the buyer won't become a financial liability to the building. This is critical because if the buyer one day goes into arrears, the other shareholders may have to shoulder those liabilities. We don't enforce a rigid formula because financial depth can come in many forms. A buyer could have a thin financial cushion if their earning prospects are rock-solid and their ongoing liabilities are thin.    For example, if you are buying a $1M apartment and you are an MIT computer science graduate working for Google with no kids but you only have $150,000 in financial assets, we might be fine with it. However, if you are piano teacher buying the same apartment with two kids in private school, then we're going to want to see more than $1M in financial assets in excess of any liabilities.   We also want indications you will be a genial member of our community.  We want you to have the personal resource of a strong and capable character to help you face with equanimity any personal setbacks you may receive in life. We may be neighbors a long, long time. We want happy neighbors. We will look at your personal recommendations for evidence of this. We want to like you and we want you to like us.   Bad things I've seen on applications: 1. Shenanigans. Be forthright. Don't tell us you earned $25K a year in interest and dividends last year when we can see on your tax return that you paid tax on only $10K. 2. Reaching. If you're claiming your car and your wardrobe as assets on your personal financial statement, you probably can't afford a co-op. I mean, what are we supposed to do if you don't pay your maintenance, make you sell your shirts? 3. Matching typos. If your personal letters of recommendation all make an unusual and identical grammatical error, we know you copied and pasted the same letter yourself and got friends to sign it. Or maybe you made those friends up? Who knows? 4. No cover letter. This is your one chance to make a personal impression and connect with the board. Take it! Some board members read only these and leave most of the package analysis to others. If you don't include one, we assume you are hiding something.    Something your broker may not tell you because she/he doesn't want you to blow it: if you get a board interview, the board has already decided to accept you. Treat the interview like a job interview (dress nicely, be respectful and attentive, etc.) and you're in. This is because once the board meets you, you have standing to sue them for discrimination if they reject you.   One other thing: some apartments have more turnover than others. Smaller apartments, the one-bedrooms that tend to be starter apartments for first time buyers, turn over more often than the classic sixes that hold a family. Boards are often more relaxed about the packages of these buyers because it's more likely to be a relationship of five years or so rather than twenty-five.   Good luck!"

AskNYC,3e0yrh,Theige,3,Tue Jul 21 06:07:24 2015 UTC,"Museums.  There are a ton of great ones, and the area can dictate a ton of stuff to do.  That's vague advice, but I have no idea what you like to see.    In general, every area has a ton of stuff.  Get out of midtown.  It's the least interesting area.  Brooklyn museum, the botanical gardens, and Prospect park are only a few blocks from each other.  Spend a day on that, but don't fret if you can't do all three (they're all a bit time commitment)  Take the Staten Island Ferry.  It's free, you can drink on it, and it passes right bye the Statue of Liberty.  Then just take it back.    At 22, drink around the Union Square area (14th street on almost every subway).  All NYU students.  It's your best bet to hang out with people.  Those are the usual recommendations I give.  No idea how long you are here, but there is no shortage of things to do.  If you really like certain things, there might be better options."

But bit of advice, regardless of what you're told, assume the roommate will be there all the time.

AskNYC,3dzy7e,Ourtimedownhere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:58:56 2015 UTC,1 room in a 3br sounds a lot more reasonable. I was assuming the entire place at first. With utilities included and access to a garden it sounds pretty sweet. You're trading bedroom size for location as Chelsea is a pretty great. There are cheaper options for a 3br situation but not much cheaper and will be in a less desirable neighborhood. You just need to determine what you're willing to trade in the balance of size/quality/location/price. All places in NY seem to be pick 2 or 3 but never all 4.

AskNYC,3e19nk,GreenSkyFish,3,Tue Jul 21 04:36:14 2015 UTC,"Long Beach is great and should be fairly empty on a weekday.  First, do yourself a favor and look at Long beach on googlemaps, you can see that there is a lot of beach and you can gain access on every block.  You can walk straight down to the beach from the train station but I would recommend walking a couple blocks east or west to get away from the other train people that are heading out there that day.  There are some great places to eat around that area as well so you don't have to go too far away from the train.  I would definitely buy the LIRR package since it basically gets you a round trip ticket for the price of a one-way.  (1-way is $9.50, daily beach pass is $12, LIRR package is $22 and includes round trip)  Then the vendor coupon, whatever that entails, is just gravy.  This is what I would do, get off the train and walk down to the boardwalk.  Once you get there make a right and walk a few blocks until you get to Laurelton Blvd.  This is a more family oriented beach so it will be a little quieter and safer.  Just a note about your stuff, I used to live there for years and never had a problem with anyone taking stuff while I was in the water but I would set up shop somewhere closer to the lifeguards if you're worried about it.  After hanging at the beach all day walk back down to Park Ave and go to Sorrento's Italian Specialties.  It is my favorite place in Long Beach by far.  You can sit outside and split a brick-oven pizza, deli sandwiches, salads, steaks whatever is all great but I'd definitely get the pizza it's amazing.  After food I'd stay on Park Avenue and walk around and check out some surf shops (Maritime or Long Beach Surf) and then go to Sutton Place for a couple drinks while waiting for whatever train you want to catch back to the city.  If you  don't want drinks and really do want coffee there is also a Starbucks across from the train.  The only other actual coffee shop that I know of is the Coffee Nut Cafe but that is nearly a mile from Sorrento's and would mean you walking past the train station just to come back to it after coffee.  You may also be able to get coffee and just hang out at Sugo, it's a cafe but I've always felt it was more of a bar/restaurant.  There isn't a ton of stuff around the blocks and neighborhood since it is all residential so I would stick to the beach/boardwalk and then Park Ave after you're done with that.  Let me know if you have any other questions."

I'm pretty neurotic so it helps for me to have a vivid idea/plan when I go do something new, especially when it's something as important as a date with my partner.  The one thing in the LIRR Package that confused me is whether the day beach pass was included in the price. I think in the package it says it's discounted? It's a bit unclear.   Sorrentos sounds great, thanks for the rec!   We'll probably set up near a lifeguard which is what I usually do (since then I'll go out in the water in front of him/her; I don't know how to swim). But it's reassuring to know it's safe and you've never had issues. I figured requiring payment to just get in would deter shady types anyway.   Thanks a bunch for the help!

I live in Greenpoint and a lot of my social life is already in the north Brooklyn area (Williamsburg, Bushwick, Greenpoint), which is all either bikeable or a train ride away. But I'm also more willing to deal with a 30 minute train ride if anything is going on in Manhattan, or if I go out after work when I'm already in the city.  On the other hand I have friends who refuse to go anywhere that requires a train transfer, assuming they even ride the train in the first place.  I would say it depends on where you ALREADY hang out. I know you don't live here yet, but if you're going to be going out all the time in the LES/SoHo/EV areas, maybe Fort Greene isn't the best place to be. It's not like there aren't bars and nightlife in Fort Greene, it's just a different scene and pace than the busier Manhattan neighborhoods."

AskNYC,3dvzcl,sshum,7,Mon Jul 20 00:07:05 2015 UTC,"Well, a lot of apartments have a July 1 or August 1 date, so in general there's less stock in September.  However, on the other hand, there's fewer people looking for apartments so its a little less crazy when you do see a place. . Some people actively seek out Sept 1 or Oct 1 leases in order to avoid the summer rush.  Its a trade-off.  Also, if you are looking outside of neighborhoods with a lot of college-age people, there's more stock that isn't tied to Aug 1  At the end of the day it depends whether you have a realistic budget for the neighborhoods you're looking at, and how much time you have to look, and whether you're wiling/able to pay a broker to save time.  Fun fact: from the 1790s up until WWII every lease in the city expired at the same time (May 1) leading to the phenomenon of ""Moving Day""; in which thousands and thousands of NYCers all tried to move on the same day... supposedly one of the craziest spectacles ever."
AskNYC,3dvzcl,cantcountnoaccount,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:18:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! If I could bother you on some more details, do you happen to know how the broker fee works like? Is it 1 month rent for broker fee, on top of first and last month rent?"
AskNYC,3dvzcl,paratactical,2,Mon Jul 20 01:33:16 2015 UTC,"FYI - the 15% is common in Manhattan. In Queens, it's usually one month. Brooklyn varies between the two. You can always try to negotiate the percentage down. As far as no fee places, everybody would take one if they were easy to find and as nice as the ones with fees. You might get lucky by doing a bunch of footwork and making a lot of phone calls or you might not. All depends on how much time you can commit to the search. Good luck."

AskNYC,3dvzcl,curiiouscat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:26:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm, seems like the best choice would be to find an apartment through a broker that doesn't require last month rent. Then that sounds doable.   Do you happen to have any recommendations for brokers?"
AskNYC,3dvzcl,tsunshun-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:34:27 2015 UTC,"I didn't use a broker! But someone else on this sub might have some recs. Just tell your broker what your price range is (minus $200 or so) and they should be able to show you options that don't require last months rent. Also! If a two year lease interests you, sometimes those units don't require a broker's fee."

Other than this, I don't have any other advice!"

We saw two real estate agents who showed us a few places (all above our price range, or horribly disgusting within our price range). They both had a fee of 15% of the entire years rent. All of our friends and family who live in those areas had to pay the same 15% fee (with different broker's of course). We noped out of there and I found us an apartment myself. If you look at the other posts, I believe the standard fee differs across the city. Queens is 12%, while in BK it can vary."

Hopefully they are all pooling tips (not terribly uncommon) at the end of the shift, anyway.  BTW: look for a tip jar on the counter.

No. Counter people receive minimum wage, only directly tipped employees (who receive at least  $30/mo in direct tips) can be paid the lower rate.

Our favorite broker really wanted to show us this one apartment in a building that sort of had a doorman.  By sort of had a doorman, I mean there was a little podium that had a desk chair next to it. We walked into the building with the broker, and there wasn't anyone at the podium. The broker said it was fine, that he knew the owner and doorman, hunted through the podium, and found the apartment key.  We went up, saw a not so great apartment, and then walked back downstairs. About halfway down the final staircase we caught sight of the podium, now complete with doorman in the accompanying desk chair. The broker shushed us and scurried to the top of the staircase out of sight of the doorman, and we listened to about 3 minutes of the broker trying to figure out how he was going to return the key without the doorman realizing that he had stolen it in the first place. Then we left, leaving the broker standing at the top of the stairs freaking out.  TL;DR: Involved in a B&E while trying to see an apartment."

Our broker showed us an apartment that he definitely knew required 50x the rent, which we didn't make, and didn't tell us until we were SUBMITTING the application. Then he made us go back and forth with the management company for literally 7 days haggling with them and finally had the mgmt company tell us if we wanted to be approved we would need to pay 4 months extra security since we only made 40x the rent. And he tried to make us take that deal so he could get the broker fee from us!! It was so shady that we backed out and found a different place with a totally different broker."

The guy sat us down and began pulling up a bunch of bullshit other listings he had that were nothing we wanted. We actually sat there for 30 mins listening to him bullshit about how he didn't have the keys for the apartment in the ad and my husband finally was like ""Ok are we going to see the apartment at 200 178th or what?"" At which point the guy got all defensive and we just walked out. We then decided to go to the building ourselves and see if there was a manager's number or something posted we could call. Turns out the building didn't exist.

Seriously, no other management company in the entire city is asking for all of this.. tax papers, w2s, bank statements, bills, the application form had to be notarized. This place was a really great apartment, and listed at $1500 which was low enough that I'd be able to save some money too so I went through their crazy application process. My broker calls me to tell me he has good news and bad news. My application was approved but they ""listed the apartment at the wrong price."" The new price turned out to be exactly 1/40th of my income. How interesting! I told my broker that the place is listed for $1500 and that's what I wanted to pay (he was only showing me apartments in this price range). He went back to the management company offering $1500 and they declined. I wound up not even moving but I never got my $200 application fee back.

On another note, why the fuck does not a single politician address the broker problem in our city? One reason why apartments are fucking unaffordable because everyone needs to pay a broker fee to just get an apartment, on top of the first month's and last month's rent along with a security deposit.

Bouncing between a few brokers to see who felt right, but on in particular from Citi Habitats worked well for us. Put an offer on an apartment, didn't get it (we were 2nd), moved on.  She started showing us a lot of apartments that we didn't like. Buildings with the same layouts, and each time we'd get out there and say ""We still don't like this layout.""  I saw a whiteboard with some prices on it from an area broker, called in, saw a 1 bedroom, and put in a deposit. I still decided to look a bit more because I'd been burned once before and it can't hurt to look - at worst, I find something nice and am out a deposit. At best I find something nice and I missed the first place, so no loss.   Turns out Broker A intended to show us that place eventually, I just got to it first. Broker A was not pleased about this. I get it, she did a lot of work for us - and if she had shown us that apartment when it went on market a week or two prior instead of the apartments we repeatedly said 'no' to, she would have gotten commission on it. But she didn't. She did try to go apeshit on the broker i found demanding - well, something. But she never showed us that place, and we never signed anything saying she gets exclusive commission on any apartment we found. She did try to withhold our deposit, but since we didn't get the apartment we put that deposit in for, she had to give it back (after some discussion with management).  Fun times - current broker is also our manager, and has been great to us. So had one bad story followed by one good one.  Also while looking for a 2 bed this month, had a broker - nice guy, islander of some sort but I'm not sure where. Or at least I thought he was a nice guy - gave my SO the stink-eye the entire time, refused to speak to my SO except to yell about staying away from an open air-conditioning vent area. No idea what the fuck that was about but we both agreed that if we were going to pick up one of those 2 beds it would be without him. The 2 bed plan didn't pan out but that was a memorable experience to say the least. My SO is Korean and I know that there are some racial tensions there, so maybe the broker had a past bad experience with a Korean similar to my SO or something.

AskNYC,3dqv8n,CharlesVanHohenheim,22,Sat Jul 18 16:06:48 2015 UTC,Old man advice.  Wait before getting married.  Just getting out of high school? That's too young.  What's your rush?   Two.  If you are going to the nice about NYC is that there's something for everyone.  So cater it to her.  Don't just pick a random spot.  Pick something personal that she would really enjoy.  What's she like what's she into? That's a good start and then people can suggest better spots.  Also how are you gonna do it cause that's important to the spot...
AskNYC,3dqv8n,seance515,-6,Sat Jul 18 17:05:15 2015 UTC,"We don't plan on getting married until we're out of college, so it's not THAT serious. This is my way of saying, hey I'm gonna stick around. Worse, worse case scenario, I just pawn off the ring.  Two, she likes beautiful sites, she used to be really into photography, taking pictures of anything from nature scenes, to downtown areas, even rusted out buildings. That's why I first thought of proposing up there, since it has a view of like the entire city. But there might be plenty of other beautiful spots to choose from. I don't necessarily want to do it anywhere in central park because... and this is going to sound stupid... it wouldn't be extremely special because we live in a more rural area, so while the giant buildings are new, park like areas are not."
AskNYC,3dqv8n,seance515,15,Sat Jul 18 18:45:48 2015 UTC,"More old man advice.  It sounds like you don't really wanna get married.  I would suggest that u take an engagement a bit more serious than that.  Saying it's not that big of a deal is a little troubling and your already making plans for ditching the ring if you need to? Doesn't sound like you're ready to get married dude.  Sounds like you're doing it for the fuck of it.  You know how to tell her you're gonna stick around? Just tell her.  That conversation is as quick as like 'hey,  let's stay together through college'  ::high five:: and done.    Sounds like u wanna give her some sort of promise ring or whatever people call that thing. I think it would be kinda shitty to ask her to propose when you really don't mean it and you actually mean that I'll be around and in another 4 or 5 years you can get married.  And even then you'll still be young and just able to get into places where u can have some fun.  Still too young for marriage.    Now back to your original question.  Old building and architecture if she's into that present a number of opportunities.  There are also places in Brooklyn and Queens where she can take some great shots and u get some amazing views of the city if that's just as good or do u want to be in Manhattan?"
AskNYC,3dqv8n,alexcake,-8,Sat Jul 18 18:58:46 2015 UTC,"I never said it wasn't a big deal. Me asking where the perfect place would be, obviously shows that it means a lot to me. I said it wasn't THAT serious, meaning it doesn't affect us legally. I can ask a stranger on the street if they'd marry me, doesn't mean it's a thing until the paper work is done. I want to do this now, because I'm looking at eight stress filled years of college and she's likely in the same boat. It'll be romantic. It'll be new. It'll be a happy, happy vacation. Thank you for your advice, it's great, I'm happy someone cares enough to tell me if they think I'm messing up, but we also made it through the shit-fest called high school, together the whole time. If I wanna marry her I'm gonna marry her. The place is what I was wondering about.  Now back to your original question, we'd prefer to stick around the Manhattan area, if possible."
AskNYC,3dqv8n,seance515,2,Sat Jul 18 21:52:57 2015 UTC,"What about looking into a promise ring instead of an engagement ring..? It can be just as big of a deal, just without the legal commitments behind it.  Also re: your original question, you should find a place that suits your common interests. If you both like nature, central park sitting by the lake would be nice. If you like art/science, maybe the Met or Natural history museums. South street seaport is also a good, relatively lowkey but very beautiful spot. It overlooks the east river & brooklyn bridge. Possibly while walking over the brooklyn or williamsburg bridges?"

AskNYC,3dqv8n,iism11,2,Sat Jul 18 18:49:09 2015 UTC,"Here are a few ideas:  She likes nature? How about sunrises? If so two good spots are Coney Island and Brooklyn. Coney Island you can head out onto a pier and watch the sunrise over the ocean, rather beautiful but it is a long trip early in the morning. In Brooklyn there is a park with one of the best views of Manhattan (see here). There is a little beach, and you can watch the rising sun reflect off the skyline.   Not into waking your ass up early? I personally wouldn't suggest a touristy location like the empire state building. Simply because there will be lots of kids and rando's running around. That might kind of ruin the mood. I would suggest maybe walking the skyline until you find the right spot, any of the piers off Manhattan (Good one on the west side) (Good one on the east side). You could also walk in Battery Park and have a nice view of the Statue of Liberty (see here)  Bridges could also be fun, maybe walk to the top of the Williamsburg or Brooklyn bridges.   Overall I would suggest you pick a time that is either really early or really late. Any of the places I suggest will be crowded if not packed in the afternoon or early evening. In the morning everything will be empty, however going for a walk after a nice dinner might be fun as well (If you need dinner recommendations let me know (and give me a price range))."
AskNYC,3dqv8n,Offthepoint,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:39:31 2015 UTC,"If you really like the idea of the Empire State building, checkout 230 5th ave. Kind of a touristy place, but has hands down the best view of the empire state building at night. It is a roof top bar on the building next to the ESB. I really only suggest it at night, and it is rather crowded on the weekends. Weeknights it is usually decent, and weekends I think you can get a table if you but a bottle."
AskNYC,3do16k,thanksfortheride,14,Fri Jul 17 20:57:16 2015 UTC,It's doable in that you can do it and still eat. But you'd be spending over half of your posttax income on rent. I would look for something cheaper personally.
AskNYC,3do16k,nxqv,6,Fri Jul 17 21:02:07 2015 UTC,"The rule of thumb is to try to keep your rent expense less than 30% of your salary, so in your case I would try to stay below $1,250/month. That being said, if you want to live in queens that's realistic. My boyfriend lives in Astoria, a safe neighborhood with a lot of culture, and has a 2 br apartment for $2400 that he splits with a roommate, so from firsthand experience you can find places to live in that price point!  Also, keep in mind that most landlords will only approve you for an apartment if you make 40x the monthly rent in 1 year. So for a $1500/month apartment you would need to make $60,000 to be approved. If you don't make this cut, you'll need to get a guarantor to cosign the lease who makes 80x the rent...someone who makes at least $120,000 a year (some landlords are more lenient but this is the majority rule).  A $1250/month apartment would require you to make at least $50,000, so you'd have a great chance of getting approved without a guarantor!"
AskNYC,3do16k,christinesmitth,0,Fri Jul 17 21:24:27 2015 UTC,"see thats also a problem, instead of a guarantor do you think the landlord would take savings? I have been investing and saving forever, and have about 130X that monthly rent of 1500 in the bank plus more assets. Otherwise i can get a guarantor."
AskNYC,3do16k,christinesmitth,3,Fri Jul 17 21:28:15 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the landlord really. Some are really lenient and will say if you have an exceptional credit score then it's okay if you make a little bit of a lower salary. Some will let you pay 2-3 months extra security if your income is lower. Some are really strict and nothing will fly unless you get a guarantor.  The reason it varies is because there's no law, it's just a guideline landlords put in place to protect themselves from someone all of a sudden not being able to afford rent. It's probably best to have a guarantor lined up that has already agreed to help you out in advance, because if you find an apartment you LOVE, but need a guarantor, you'll need to act quickly on it or need to pass it up."
AskNYC,3do16k,nokinok,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:31:12 2015 UTC,I had a landlord deny me once when I was applying for an apartment as a student because I didn't have enough income. He said the only way I could get the apartment is if I paid a year up front. You might be able to make that kind of offer.
AskNYC,3do16k,dougiemeowserMD,9,Wed Jul 22 01:56:22 2015 UTC,"Yearly, that comes to $18000 in rent.  Your salary should be no less than 4 times greater than your rent (to be comfortable, of course).  That would be  $72000/year.  It's doable, but how much do you value things like eating out, going to bars, or really doing anything besides pay rent and bills?  I make ~52,000 and pay $500/month but I also don't live alone.  I have a bigger apartment with a yard in a decent area.  I'm able to put money away each month and also have a social life.

From what I understand, there was a time when they weren't - when some lines were known jaunts of muggers and were widely regarded as unsafe (particularly at night), and when an angry vigilante shot four men who he felt were threatening him.  Those days are LONG gone. The subways, like NYC itself, are very safe today - which isn't to say that crime doens't happen, but that it's rare. (At the stop closest to me, for example, there were 31 total crimes between July 1 2008 and June 30 2013 --- against a total daily ridership of 7489. That's not very many at all).  But the bad days were so prominent and so newsworthy that the memory of them echoes in the rest of American culture. New York is safe, today.

AskNYC,3dokwx,lymeguy,4,Fri Jul 17 23:40:37 2015 UTC,"2 - Is it worth not having a car regularly to be in the city? As simply put in suburbs it's easy to have a car while city trains can be taken anywhere and parking would be annoying.   People often think of not having a car as some sort of impediment, but that can't really be applied to the city. Rather, I feel sorry for people that do rely on cars here. The subway's problems aside, there is a helluva lot of freedom in being able to get pretty much anywhere you want, 24 hours a day, for $2.75, without having to worry about parking, or having too many drinks, or being completely disabled by traffic. And for everything else, there's Zipcar or car2go or a cab.  I'd take the freedom of living like this any day over the ""freedom"" of a car-dependent, suburban life.  I've never really had to start from scratch socially here, so I can't answer this definitively, but if you know just one person that you like I'd suggest latching on to them and weaseling your way into their social circle. Nicely and charmingly, of course!"
AskNYC,3dokwx,ggsacks,5,Sat Jul 18 00:58:31 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. I live in a smaller city right now (native NYer) and do have a car, and the fact that the car is my only way of getting most places within a reasonable amount of time is very limiting (there is some public transit here, but it only runs along specific corridors and isn't the nicest system in the world, and cycling works when the weather is nice, but winters here are brutal). I miss being able to take public transit everywhere, and not having to worry about maintenance and the like. Owning a car doesn't give you freedom, it just makes up for the poor state of public transport in the rest of the country.   Besides, if you want to take a day trip or a road trip out of the city every once in a while, it's cheaper to rent. And parking in the city really isn't any fun, at all."
AskNYC,3dokwx,menschmaschine5,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:14:37 2015 UTC,"How much you need really depends on where you want to live, how often you'll go out, and the like.

If you're willing to live with roommates, live somewhere other than lower Manhattan and the fully gentrified parts of Brooklyn, etc, you can get by on less. Some people manage to survive on less than 35k a year, somehow, so being thrifty is doable. It just depends on what compromises you're willing to make.   Edit: and you will have to work to make friends, but it's a lot of people in a small space so it can't be too hard. I grew up in the city so I've never had to start from scratch."

I feel like people make friends relatively easily at bars in places like Bushwick, but places in Williamsburg have a very planned-evening-out feel to them where it can be hard to find approachable parties. I usually make friends with my baristas/bartenders and go from there lol.   2 - Is it worth not having a car regularly to be in the city?    No. Buy a metrocard. $31 weekly, $120 monthly. Way cheaper than a car.   3 - How much money monthly would it take to be comfortable in the city? I.E. able to afford food and decent sized place, etc.?  Depends. You can sublet a good room in a cool neighborhood (bushwick, bed-stuy) for like 8/900, but you have to be comfortable with a roommate situation. Otherwise studios/1 Brs can start at like 1600. Food, all depends how you go about it. If you shop at like, Foodtown and use coupons/sales, you can get away with a $120/mo food budget. If you like to go out or order out a lot, you'll need a lot more. Basically prepare for at least $1500/mo income if you want to keep it cheap but still live comfortably."

AskNYC,3dmmm3,SwellandDecay,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"While we are used to it, the map can be very intimidating for someone who isn't from NYC. Also, even for lifelong NYers, if you give a destination to 5 people, you'll get 5 different routes.   OP, the MTA website has a Trip Planner. You type in where you are coming from and where you are going and when, and it'll give you routes. You can also use googlemaps for public transit, but there are often changes for construction on the weekends and late at night that might not be reflected there.   In case you don't know, you buy a MetroCard at a machine in the station. $1 for the card and $2.75 per ride."

You will find the biggest raises in your salary at an office job than by finding minimum wage employment elsewhere.

If you find the right bar, it could actually be fun and not stressful.   I'm not sure how a sub-$35k job that burns you out (8:30-6 is a standard work schedule) is worth keeping, but if you can't improve that and you don't want to work double, your best bet is just to spend less money per month."

I made a few hundred bucks on there in my last job where I could turk at work.  Every so often you'll find a good HIT that pays well. I've cranked out some articles in 25min and earned $35 on them. Those are rare finds, but if you're a decent writer (you don't need a journalism degree, and I bet it hurts less if you don't have one /shrug), you may start to get invites to do good HITs (HIT meaning Human Intelligence Task — something that can't be done by a robot, yet, so they'll pay you like a sweatshop worker). Amazon payments will then let you transfer the funds to a bank account (no fee) or use the money towards Amazon purchases.  Don't get too psyched though because you'll probably make $5 your first day. This isn't going to pay your rent, but there are some fringe tales out there wherein it actually does pay the rent.  If you can do this at work, you'll feel better about the time you put into it.

You can get cheaper shoes than that- but if you're going to be walking around daily in them, then the leather holds up nicely. They tend to run narrow, so I always order up a size and get an insert as well for like $8.   Aldo also have free shipping over $70 so if you buy two pairs you could see which ones you like more. These are dressy shoes btw but for everyday walking.  If you subscribe to ALDO you can get 15% off first order as well- just enter email address.

That same studio now is probably in the 1700-1800 range because of location.  I'd say you might have some trouble finding something of good size at the 1500 range, but its worth looking around at least for a day or two.

For the Giants/Redskins game - it's a Thursday night game.  I would recommend doing the following - finding a sponsored party bus (the Blind Pig on 14th Street has a good, rowdy one for all Jets & Giants home games.  It's like $50 or something for round trip transportation and all you can drink to and from stadium.  Then you might also post on the Giants sub, and ask about any group tailgates that you can buy tickets to.  Very common for large parties to have what are essentially sponsored tailgates of 20-50 people or more, where people sort of but don't really know each other and just pay a fixed amount (like $20 or $30) for food and beers.    Tailgate scenes for weekday night games are less crazy that Sunday games in my opinion - so the first option might be your best.  Have fun."

Americans practice the fine tradition of tailgating, tailgating is basically parking lot partying. People bring lawn games, grills, and of course cheap piss tasting American beer to drink by the gallon. Tailgating is most associated with Football (ours not yours) so for that game, I'd recommend showing up at least 4 hours early, and just wander the lot talking to people, ask about the sport and I'm sure one group will insist that you join them for some burgers and beers, bring your own beer too don't wanna seem rude. Baseballs never been my game so I'll defer to others on that."

AskNYC,3djwps,carpy22,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:45:27 2015 UTC,"With the NY Giants, going to tailgate in the parking lot prior to the game is pretty essential to the experience.

The best route depends on traffic at the time.  If you have a smartphone with data in the US, use google maps or Waze for directions.  if you don't have a smartphone with data in the US,  when you get close to NYC, you can listen to 1010AM or 880AM for traffic reports.

AskNYC,3di6hi,XmertonX,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:38:16 2015 UTC,"The Bronx River parkway is fine. I live on Long Island now and have been commuting up to Westchester (county north of the Bronx) for interviews and job orientation, been doing the ""hard"" part of this trip almost daily.  The only real choice I would say is between taking 87 south all the way to the George Washington bridge, or getting off 87 near Albany and taking 787 to 90 to the Taconic State Parkway. I would do the latter as the GWB on a Friday could be backed up. You're definitely going to hit a slowdown no matter where you go, but the GWB can be frustrating on a high traffic day like a Friday. IT's also a little confusing getting to it, and the GPS will cut out when you're on the bridge for a moment, usually has trouble figuring out where you are. If I remember correctly its also during a crucial exit.  You'll also have the option of taking the Whitestone Bridge or the Throggs Neck Bridge to cross onto LI, but it's arbitrary and both are toll bridges, and both basically lead to the same place (Cross Island Parkway).  Once you're on the island, the Cross Island Parkway leads to I495. Stay in the right lane on the CIP when you cross the bridge despite it being slow because there's an annoying merge there that's always backed up to the exit for the 495 east. After getting on the 495 just take it to exit 68 south (about 45 mins of driving)."

If you decide to take the bus, I suggest the M60 SBS to the N/Q subway, which should take you right to your hotel. That's about 10-15 minutes in the bus, then 15-30 minutes on the subway. You can pick up a 7-Day unlimited at  MetroCard vending machines in LGA terminals B, C, and D.  Citymapper is a great transit app."

Also the Q70 has luggage racks.   Citymapper is a great transit app.   Citymapper is probably the best transit app.  But you should seriously consider a taxi if you have more than just a carryon.

Unfortunately LaGuardia is only connected to the subway by bus, so if you want to bus from the airport you could do that.  I would suggest taking a taxi (the day matters as well as the time) there is a taxi line but sometime you have to wait not always.    You refer to the subway by the number OR letter,  some trains run the same line like the A,C,E (blue) The A,C starts in far Rockaway (queens) goes through Brooklyn and into the southern end of manhattan where it links with the E train they all run the same line north till 50th street where the E train goes back to Queens.  The tricky part is that the A is the express train and the C is the local.  What often happens is you would take the A to the closest express stop and jump to the C to hit your local stop.    App wise i often use ""embark NYC"" it is simple and easy to use as well as gives you clear communication about delays and diversions.  Let me know if you have any more questions"

Don't explore the West Village and the surrounding areas—you have the rest of your lease to do that.   Instead, while you're new to NYC and have time to kill, I'd recommend going to far out places while you're not jaded yet. Way too many NYers get too comfortable in their own neighborhood and never leave. Here's a start:   Explore Williamsburg and all its hipster offerings. Go to Smorgasburg on a Saturday, eat your heart out, and enjoy the view of Manhattan.  Take the East River Ferry from Wall St. to DUMBO to Williamsburg. Walk the Brooklyn Bridge. Check out art galleries in Chelsea or Bushwick. Go to Central Park on a weekday and enjoy it without tourists. Go up to the Bronx and check out the zoo. Go see a Mets game in Queens or a Yankees game in the Bronx. Get Greek food in Astoria, Indian food in Jackson Heights, Polish food in Greenpoint, Ride the Staten Island Ferry (it's free!) and see the Statue of Liberty. Laugh at the tourists who pay for a ferry to Liberty Island. For the video gamer in you: check out all 3 locations of Barcade (Williamsburg, Chelsea, East Village). It's a bar with old-school arcade games. Each location has different games so they're all worth checking out. Prosperity Dumpling is for people who never leave Manhattan. Don't be that guy (or girl). Instead, go on a dumpling crawl in Flushing, Queens. Take the D, F, N or Q trains all the way to the end and go to Coney Island. Ride a roller coaster or something and hang out on the beach. Take the A train to Rockaway Beach, get some sun, get some tacos at Rockaway Beach Surf Club.   These are all mostly things that will be hard to do on a weekday when you start a job and end up spending 80% of your time in the neighborhood you live in and the neighborhood your office is in.

AskNYC,3dglsc,thequestionablekiwi,2,Fri Jul 17 17:57:31 2015 UTC,"Whatever you do, don't rent a router from TWC, it is unreliable and ends up costing more in the long run.  Buying a good modem and router can be pricey but will be worth it in savings when compared to rental and in quality.  I have TWC and use a Motorola Arris SURFboard and a NETGEAR Nighthawk R7000.  Keep in mind the internet speed you are paying for when choosing the modem/router, you probably don't want to buy a 800Mbps capable modem and router when you're only paying for 100Mbps internet.  Edit: Also check here to find a modem that works with TWC and fits the speed you're paying for."
AskNYC,3dglsc,snobum,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:06:24 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of things to consider.  For a basic router, you want to make sure you have 802.11b/g/n support.  Some of the newer routers will also support 802.11ac.  The good news is you don't have to worry too much about picking the right one.  If you pick a router with 802.11ac, it will be compatible with all previous versions (b, g, and n).  N is the most common (and cost effective) right now.  802.11ac is making some headway though.  The ""up to X feet"" and ""up to XX Mb/s"" can be complete BS.  Generally speaking, it's the wireless technology that determines your range (802.11n goes farther than 802.11g, which goes farther than 802.11b).  I would ignore it.  As long as you have 802.11n router, you should be fine.  WARNING: The following gets more technical.  Most wifi operates in the 2.4GHz range.  If you live in an area with a lot of apartments close by, you'll probably have a lot of wireless interference from other hotspots which will slow down your connection.  You can change the wireless channel to try to minimize this, but there are only 11 different channels and only 3 of them don't overlap.    If you have a lot of hotspots near you already and if your devices can handle a 5GHz wireless signal (and not all will), I would strongly suggest getting a 5GHz router (either dual band n or 802.11ac).  5GHz is not that common yet, and provide more non-overlapping channels.  I currently have an ac router that provides 2 networks for me to use (one in the 5GHz, one in the 2.4GHz range).  What's important to note is not all dual-band routers will provide 2 different networks.  Some will only let you select one or the other.    Yes, it can be confusing.    tl;dr As long as you have an 802.11n router, you should be fine.    EDIT: I just noticed you are trying to avoid the TWC fee.  In that case, you will need your own modem and router.  Make sure the modem is compatible with TWC.  Some of them have wireless built in so you wouldn't need a separate router."
AskNYC,3dglsc,lumpy_potato,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:03:17 2015 UTC,"I've had excellent reliability from Asus modems - the N-series modems are usually <$100, has an incredible UI, and supports lots of 'fun' features if you are interested (built-in support for USB network drives, built-in torrent client, easy setup for VPN/port forwarding, etc.)  I also picked up a motorola surfboard with DOCSIS3.0 support for TWC. The router is simultaneous dual-band - not all routers do both at the same time, you want one that can do both. My SO's laptop only does 2.4ghz, my phone does 2.4 and 5, i have another laptop that only does 2.4, etc. etc.  I've been using my N56-U for about 4 years now, its dead reliable, and I haven't had to restart it more than two or three times, each for firmware updates."

AskNYC,3daphi,mutokangius,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:34:41 2015 UTC,"A few points about Karma:   It is on the Sprint network. I'm not sure how much Sprint has improved its 4G service recently, but as of the middle of last year it was not good. Slower speeds and worse coverage than the other providers. The main advantage with Karma is simpler pricing. Pay as you go for data that doesn't expire is nice, but if you expect to be using a lot of data fairly consistently, you can actually save money going with a traditional mobile broadband plan without having to commit to a contract. The device will be about the same price, and the per-GB data cost is actually lower. The downside is just that you need to use it during the month or you lose it and start over again.  If you have a 4G smartphone you might already have tethering with your current plan.   Karma looks like a good option for occasional data users who are in an area with good Sprint coverage. For heavier users there are better options."

I personally swear by LTI, I know a few of the people there and trust that lab to handle my film well. CRC is also a pretty safe bet, though I've only used them a few times. Another two options to consider would be duggal, and laumont. They're both larger commercial labs, whereas LTI seems like a smaller operation, and more oriented towards artists. Normal processing with them is usually 24 hour or less, but you could get rush done in a few hours in a pinch.

Pick up Chambers heading west to the Hudson River bike path and ride it up to the GWB. You can turn around there, stop for a bite at Dinosaur BBQ and then head east into Central Park. You can exit the park at 59th and 5th to show them the dangerous side.  The ride down Fifth is dicey.  Biking here is manageable, but it's not the best. I got into biking only recently myself and wish there were better routes."

If you go under the BQE, you've missed the turn.  After that, right on Navy, left on Sands which will take you onto the Manhattan Bridge. The Brooklyn Bridge is somewhat of a nightmare to bike across on account of all the tourists wandering in the bike lane, which is separated from the tiny pedestrian lane by a mere stripe of paint."
AskNYC,3d711n,pfeper,2,Tue Jul 14 04:03:11 2015 UTC,"Most of this is good, but Brooklyn Bridge can suck because of pedestrians. The Williamsburg Bridge isn't much better but, IMO, better.

Loop the park and then cross over to the West Side Highway Bike Path. Ride that down and then cross over and take the Manhattan over back to BK and then ride out by BK bridge park. Hang out there for a little then head back to Williamsburg.   The only hard parts are crossing town but the places youll be crossing will be easy. Yes this is long but theres tons of places to stop along the way to hang out and rest.   Don't do the Brooklyn honestly, especially in the summer.

AskNYC,3d4kxx,addictedtolove1,3,Mon Jul 13 14:51:57 2015 UTC,"It's a great gym, I went for 2 years but you do get what you pay for. I went to Blink after to save money and I never went, go figure. When you spend 200 bucks on the gym, you go 5 days a week. Now I go to a local gym in my neighborhood which is no Equinox but it's definitely not Blink or Planet Fitness where you can never get on a machine because it's overcrowded.  NY Sports club might do the passes too. Best gym in the city as far as number of locations, I cant even count the amount of times I used they gym just to take an emergency shit while out and about in the city."

AskNYC,3d4kxx,addictedtolove1,2,Mon Jul 13 15:32:55 2015 UTC,"Some things I loved about Equinox were:  1. Locker rooms, always clean, no cruisey shit in the locker rooms (Thats a major problem in NY Sports club regardless of location, Men's only I'm sure) 2. The classes are awesome, I'm a guy and mostly lifted weights but Yoga was great at the SoHo location and so was spin class. 3. Even when it's crowded you can still get a machine. 4. Great showers and Kiehls products, hell I would shower there just as much as my apartment  Just dont do Blink, the environment is lame, WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE, no amenities. That  was my experience anyways."

AskNYC,3d4kxx,FirstLadyOfBeer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:16:00 2015 UTC,":)  I think you can get away with a few free passes but there's only so many times you can do that with the different gyms in the city, they usually take your ID and put you in the system so they'll know.  Also, I dont do it but I'm aware of this - https://classpass.com/ My Ex does it and likes(d) I dont know I dont talk to her now lol, so if you're into classes and want to go to different gyms, it's cheaper than Equinox and you can go to a bunch of places."

Also, is the bus the only option from these apartments? You should likely be focused on the subway, not buses. And keep in mind that an AirBNB that you can rent for less than 30 days without the regular tenant staying there, too (eg you and your gf rent one bedroom in a two bedroom place) is illegal.   NYC doesn't have a real city center like other cities. It's too big. Brooklyn would be the fourth largest U.S. city if it weren't in NYC. Each neighborhood has more ""downtown"" like sections. I'm guessing you're looking for the village and such. I don't think an hour on the subway is bad, but that is up to you.   I recommend using Google maps or HopStop to get transit directions. One last thing - watching the ball drop in Times Square is fucking horrible and you should make other plans. It will be expensive to go out here on New Years Eve, so prepare yourself for that."
AskNYC,3d6h4f,paratactical,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:19:42 2015 UTC,"If by city center you mean midtown, it will likely be pricey during holiday week, but Murray Hill, Kips Bay, Gramercy Park are good neighborhoods (Manhattan east side between ~14th-40th streets). Bars and restaurants line the avenues and you are walking distance to: Empire State Building, Times Square, Grand Central, and more. It also takes no more than 30 minutes to get pretty much anywhere else in Manhattan. For a more affordable option, Astoria is a great hub in Queens and is a 20 minute subway ride into midtown Manhattan. Same feel with restaurants/bars everywhere, and a very diverse ethnic feel with a lot of cuisines to choose from.   Super touristy, but I would go to Rockefeller center and see the tree! I've lived here for 22 years and still do it every year. Going after Christmas day is not as crowded. Union Square has a great holiday market/craft fair that runs daily during most of December and January too.  NYE will be pricey if you choose to do anything besides stay at home. I would strongly advise against doing the Times Square thing, unless you're fine with being claustrophobic and not having access to a bathroom for ~12 hours. I would opt for restaurant overlooking times square if you really want to see the ball drop live, or a bar anywhere else in the city if you don't care. Reserving a spot anywhere on NYE regardless of location needs to be done a few weeks in advance and will cost anywhere from $100-$500 a person just to get a pass to enter, so be prepared."

Those might not be good location-wise for the meetings you're taking though, which I'm going to guess are all in the tech hub of the city, around the Flatiron (or as the realtors would say, Silicon Alley...), so camping out in the Ace Hotel lobby would fit the bill nicely for you: its right in the neighborhood and full of young freelancers working away drinking their Stumptown coffee day in and day out.

Don't bother with giving excuses (""I don't have change"" ""I don't have money"" ""I'm broke""). Don't give people money unless you feel very compelled to -- it's unusual to do so. Being very kind would be giving leftover food, being polite would be giving a response, and being normal would be just ignoring.   So long as you are not being abusive, you're fine.

I lost a lot of friends to heroin, which drives my complete disregard for idiot crusties, so that one goes in the other direction.) Many are making a profit, none are hungry, however, all of them are miserable. Give them what you're comfortable giving them, but keep those three things in mind.  No one is going to be alarmed if you say nothing to them, completely ignore their existence, or, as I often find myself doing without thinking, rolling my eyes upon hearing certain pleas which I know are a bit of a stretch. But if you were to say something to them, without stopping to give to them or talk longer in order to help them out in some way or another... I mean, what are the words, even, that you would say?

The people who live in the streets rather than shelters are the one's who are more likely to be unhealthy and unpredictable. Regardless, you should treat the healthy and unhealthy humanely.

It is continuing a stigma which is only exacerbating the problem.   To your second point, I didn't mean that to come off as lying. You should be truthful. I rarely have change because I use my debit card as much as I can so that is one of the first reasons that popped into my head. There are many reasons why people can't give away money on the street and those are fair and legitimate. You can't go into depth about your financial situation or your understanding of invisible hand economics so simply saying I'm sorry I can't help you is enough. Not only is that truthful, it gives someone who is isolated from society just a brief moment to connect with someone personally which, whether they know it or not, is very valuable for their situation."

I specifically said that many homeless people aren't dangerous, but was correcting you about mental health in the homeless community, which is a huge problem. So stop playing social justice word salad.  This whole thing about giving a ""valuable"" social interaction is pretentious bullshit.

AskNYC,3d2a53,TotesMessenger,-10,Mon Jul 13 14:15:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I misunderstood the context of the first part of your post.   I don't think it's a social movement or some justice bullshit. I think one of the worst things you can do to someone, particularly someone in need is to flat out ignore them. Maybe you haven't had that experience but it is particularly nasty to not even be looked at as a result of your situation. The only thing I want people to do is to treat the homeless in the same way they treat everyone else. If a well dressed man went up to you in the street and said he was in a bit of trouble and needed a couple bucks, you have no more obligation to give him the money than you have towards the homeless man, yet you wouldn't ignore the well dressed man. You would look him in the eye and say you didn't have any money to spare.   It's not about guilt or shame or anything. It's about treating someone with the same dignity regardless of their background.   As for why it's valuable, it is breaking the stigma and stereotype that people have about the homeless, which allows them more opportunities to be hired, to find help, and to get out of their situation.   You can ignore the homeless because they inconvenience you or you can acknowledge them and do the bare minimum to help their situation. I choose the second as often as I can."

Personally, I absolutely would ignore the well-dressed man. Every single time. I would not even pause. I've been approached at night in gas stations by people asking for $2 for gas to get home, in hotel parking lots at dawn by men saying they need bus fare to see their sick mothers, and the list goes on and on. I get in my car, lock the doors and gtfo. I enjoy living and I don't give anyone the benefit of the doubt when it comes to potentially being put in a harassing or dangerous situation unless they are bleeding. Ignoring the homeless or the non-homeless situationally is self-preservation, not perpetuating a stigma.  EDIT: Oh, you know what? I forgot the best example. Pittsburgh, Labor Day weekend, September 1992. Walking downtown with 4 girlfriends from high school, all of us college freshman from different universities around the state, when we were approached by a clean, white man in a business suit. He walked right up to us and whispered very closely, ""Girls, do you want to pee in my mouth? Who wants to pee in my mouth? I'll pay you all to pee in my mouth!!"" We got out of there so fast, but ended up laughing hysterically a few blocks later. But yeah, I don't trust freaks in business suits either. They just wanna steal my pee. Or buy it. Not sure which is worse.  1992 -  To us, watersports meant going out on Harvey's Lake on someone's boyfriend's dad's boat to drink Coors Light."

This is what I'd say to a well dressed person, a person in rags, my friend who wants to borrow money that I don't want to give money to, or a very cute raccoon trying to steal my snack: ""No, I'm sorry.""

You mentioned just be polite in your first comment and after that it was just disagreements about writing style or god knows what. Rather than being so stuck up you could just clarify your point. Anyways I never said to lie, it is just not true that everyone has the money so being truthful about it is fine.  If you feel the wording of that is more hurtful than simply, no sorry, then fine. It's a good and insightful point. You don't have to suck yourself off by attempting to devalue my idea by comparing it to sociology and calling me names. It's just poor discussion."

When I used that line, I'd see visible frustration from the people I was talking with because they knew it was bullshit. Just say no and keep walking -- don't waste their time and don't lie to them. You can spare money compared to them, so don't insult them by pretending to be broke.   You didn't read my comment well enough, so you went on a rant about justice and being humane, which was off-topic. Since you were being dense, I made things more clear for you!  Also, it doesn't really matter whether it's not technically a lie, you seem like a dick when you say you don't have money but you look like you do. ""I don't have change on me"" is saying ""I'd give it to you, but circumstances are such that I can't."" That's something we've all heard, and it never feels good. Someone says it presumably to make the other person feel better, but it really just assuages their own guilt. ""We'd hire you, but we don't have the resources."" ""I'd date you, but it's not the right time."" --> these things suck to hear and ""I don't have cash on me"" is exactly in that vein.   You're welcome to say whatever you want to whomever you want, I just chafe at it being given to someone as advice for a ~nicer~ or more ~ethical~ thing to say. I think it's douchey.

Call it rude if you want (I would disagree) but going about your business and ignoring people is not dehumanizing them. Often times if you engage or so much as make eye contact, you're setting yourself up to be hassled which is especially true if you share a block with aggressive beggars (like I do) who will follow you and yell at you.  To the OP - really, ignoring is fine. Say nothing, don't make eye contact, don't feel bad. You're not a bad person. You're a schmuck trying to make ends meet like most of the rest of us in the city. Some day when you can, donate time or money to reputable relief efforts if you want to help. But don't let anyone make you feel guilty about going about your life and avoiding harassment."
AskNYC,3d2a53,ilexVomitoria,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:59:15 2015 UTC,"If you are being harassed that's a different matter. My problem is with the precedent that the homeless are bad and should not be interacted with. The assumption that they will follow you down the street and harass you is a stereotype that I feel serves to dehumanize them. When you categorize the homeless into a group associated with negative and aggressive behavior, that is no different than stereotyping someone based on their race or gender. In some cases the stereotype might reflect the truth but in a large majority of cases, the stereotype is far from it. So in the same way that it is dehumanizing to black people to assume that they are criminals, it is dehumanizing to homeless people to assume that they are aggressive and ignorant of moral boundaries. Consequently, it is dehumanizing to ignore a group of people based on that assumption. It's late so I hope that makes sense.   It's not about feeling guilty. This is a capitalist society. You can't set the moral precedent to give money to the homeless because it would be impossible to fulfill that goal without becoming homeless yourself. The point is that even if you can't give money to the homeless, don't deny them their dignity and humanity by refusing to acknowledge their existence. Of course you'll find the oddball who will harass you but if you take that experience and extend it to the whole homeless population, you are doing more damage than good. Money can't fix every problem, but a society that stigmatizes and ignores a problem can only cause more problems. If you can change how society feels about it's lowest socioeconomic class then and only then is there the chance to change or improve their situation."

If they get right up in your face, look past them. You see nothing.   Once you engage either verbally or visually, it's possible for them to escalate the level of interaction. Most will beg for money and perhaps give you a sad story. Perhaps 1% of beggars will get aggressive. It's best not to chance it.  Seriously, it's really sad and when I was a kid I used to give them my loose change. But if you do it once, they/others that see will target you and demand more than you can give.

Doesn't have to be much but it's good in the event you get a particularly aggressive beggar, just fork over 9 cents say ""Sorry, its all I got"" and move on. In most cases, they've got a cup with some change in it so it's not like they know what you gave anyway.  If you're confronted particularly aggressively, or in a way which makes you feel uncomfortable it helps to de-escalate. And if you just goofed and made eye-contact, giving something will make you feel less like garbage and is better than giving nothing."
AskNYC,3d2a53,nutgrump,2,Mon Jul 13 01:29:33 2015 UTC,"For me it's a case by case basis and usually depends on how handy I have change without having to dig for it.

If I don't have change, or if I'd have to stop for >10 seconds, I just say ""I'm sorry, no.""  Plain ignoring them is too cold for me. I prefer to at least acknowledge someone asking or help.

If you're looking for good ""A+"" dining experiences, check out Momofuku Ko, Eleven Madison Park, Le Bernardin, Daniel, or the NoMad.

Amazing crab cakes. It's also a short walk from Rockefeller Center and other tourist spots. http://benjaminsteakhouse.com  Strip House (13 E 12th St) A reservation a couple days in advance is good. It's a little more crowded than the other restaurants, but the food is great. Great seafood. Try the goose fat potatoes.

AskNYC,3d0c0e,disasteruss,2,Sun Jul 12 13:36:57 2015 UTC,"I say, start with Zocdoc to find a concise list of who takes your insurance, then Google them/ask around. If you have one doctor that you trust, by the way, you can call them and say, ""Hey, I found this doctor online, do you know anything about them?""   Also, haven't tried this in NYC, but in other cities, Yelp - weirdly enough - is a good resource for cross referencing."

ZocDoc and word of mouth from co-workers since they'll most likely have the same insurance plan as you.  I've used ZocDoc but it's basically like Yelp—you'll want to take all the ratings and reviews with a grain of salt.  Other thing too is once you get ONE decent doctor, they'll usually be able to refer you to another doctor who specializes in a particular discipline. I was referred to my PCP by my therapist, for example."

AskNYC,3d1e9h,andyetanotherkiwi,14,Sun Jul 12 18:51:06 2015 UTC,"Amtrak is really comfortable. I used to ride it every week with no problem. If you book far enough in advanced, you can get cheap business class tickets, too (upgrading a few hours before also works, cost efficiency wise).  It's so much better than Megabus.   If you have the funds, I recommend the Acela."
AskNYC,3d1e9h,the-chickens,2,Sun Jul 12 18:54:40 2015 UTC,"That's good to know! I've never even heard Acela, but I'm not rich and Amtrak seems good enough for me. Thanks!"
AskNYC,3d1e9h,cantcountnoaccount,7,Sun Jul 12 18:59:27 2015 UTC,"Acela is special high speed Amtrak service, its basically an entire train that's ""business class"". It replaced the old business class service, which was called Metroliner. Sometimes, if you're suuuuper lucky, you'll get an old Metroliner car hooked up to a standard train. Leg room for miles.   Amtrak is extremely safe and very normal.   Its really the preferred mode of transport between Boston, NYC, Philly, Baltimore and DC (what's called the Northeast Corridor, the most heavily traveled part of all of Amtrak), for many people.   Some trains to DC have ""Quiet Car"" no cell phone conversations, loud in-person conversations, or children under 12 allowed.  Glorious."
AskNYC,3d1e9h,mommie,-7,Sun Jul 12 19:20:52 2015 UTC,Safe unless your on the train that hits a suicidal person or derails with fatalities.. Suicide incidents happens frequently.

AskNYC,3d1e9h,FishCantHoldGuns,8,Sun Jul 12 19:03:13 2015 UTC,"Amtrak is its own level between buses and airlines in terms of safety.  To be completely honest, the least safe part of it is dealing with whoever is meandering about in NY Penn. The last time I took Amtrak some dude just started peeing on the ground right next to me inside the station. But even then, it's just Penn Station.  I don't know if I'd check luggage, but again, that's its own level between buses and airlines as well.  It's safe enough, I wouldn't worry."
AskNYC,3d1e9h,HaveaManhattan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:07:22 2015 UTC,"When I've checked luggage, it was no problem.  You usually just hand it to the guy and he throws it in the bin under the train before you get on.  Pick it up there too.  It's like putting it in the trunk compartment of the train.  Unless they changed it in the past few years."

Anyway, like everyone else has said, Amtrak is the most convenient mode of transportation if you can afford it. Depending on the route and time of day, you can very often get your own seat and it's not very cramped even if you do have a seatmate. It's also incredibly convenient in that you just show up to the station and pretty much walk right onto the train. Hardly any waiting on line or hassles."

AskNYC,3d0j5v,riverskye,2,Mon Jul 13 02:55:37 2015 UTC,"There are two types of TWC hotspots. There is a regular TWC WiFi hotspot, which I believe is open and free to anyone to use. Then there is Passpoint, which is a secure TWC WiFi hotspot and you have to use your TWC account to login to access. If you download the TWC WiFi app, there is an option (at least on the iPhone) to download a profile that will automatically log you in to the Passpoint hotspot when you are in range. This way you don't have to enter your login information every time.  To use passpoint you must be a TWC customer. I'm not sure if you need to have Internet service with TWC, or if you can access it if you just have cable service."
AskNYC,3d0j5v,daspion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:40:57 2015 UTC,"TWC, Cablevision and Comcast have a deal that if you are a paying subscriber of any of the 3, you get access to either TWCWifi, CableWifi, or ComcastWifi Networks.

Of course, you yourself don't seem have access to the meter, but perhaps the picture you received can be sent to ConEd?  If the landlord continues to deny access to the meter and won't take monthly photos or readings to submit to ConEd himself, I'd call 311. They might be able to provide some recourse."
AskNYC,3cxw0u,Corazon-DeLeon,2,Sat Jul 11 22:12:23 2015 UTC,How is that allowed? The overpayment should roll over to the following month.
AskNYC,3cxw0u,luxdesigns,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:36:25 2015 UTC,"They can't verify an overpayment without access to the meters. If they accessed the meters today & found an overcharge on my current bill, they will adjust. There's no way at this point for them to know our actual usage for, say, January. Their rep put it, ""Unfortunately we can't time travel."""
AskNYC,3cxw0u,Corazon-DeLeon,6,Sat Jul 11 21:01:08 2015 UTC,"The meters show how much has been used, though. So they can calculate how much has been used since the last reading.  The meters roll over after 9999, at which point it becomes 0000.  You got a lazy rep. If another rep gives you the same answer, get a lawyer and sue. Con Edison has no right to charge you for energy use that it can't prove you used especially when it's not so hard for them to put the facts together on their own."

AskNYC,3d17hv,the-chickens,5,Mon Jul 13 15:46:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're into. I know plenty of people who would have more fun with D.C. and NYC might not be a good fit for them. I think that's a reasonable assessment--pay attention to why people in your city aren't into NYC.  If you're into art, theatre, music, or just plain partying though, NYC is a really great place. And if you're a girl, clubbing will be relatively inexpensive or free if you find a promoter.   Tons of free shows of all different kinds, a lot of interesting poetry readings, EVEN WITH a shit ton of major venues closing, tons of really great music every night of the week.   Food is excellent here and you can find any kind of cuisine you want, especially if you're willing to go into the outer boroughs. The only type of food I've had genuine trouble finding is Burmese, which is super niche. There are also no Irish restaurants that are any good (but a really great Irish grocery store if that's your thing). But I mean...   Tons of volunteer opportunities. Like learning languages? I can think of no better place.  Shopping - obviously NYC has got most other places beat. THE fashion capital of the world. A lot of micro-celebs in fashion get their start in NYC. Most do, actually.  It's a central enough location that if you have enough disposable income, there are a ton of great day trips you can take. Weekend trips to New England are easy too.   Large-ish paranormal/pagan community here. Definitely very colorful, diverse ""nerd"" community (video games, comics, etc).   Lots of ethnic enclaves still exist, too. Not so much in Manhattan, but like I said, don't be afraid to travel.  But anyway, it's all up to what you're looking for. I love D.C. and it has a lot of things that NYC doesn't, so fuck anyone who's scoffing at that. What do you do for work? What are you looking for? Answer those and you have this solved."

Education, continuing or otherwise (for public/foreign service). More job opportunities in that vein. The vibe is just different and that, as trivial as it sounds, makes a difference. Plus while NYC is loaded with museums - DC has a different type of museum.   Also, for as diverse as NYC is, it really is a city for a particular type of person with a particular set of goals. Unless you were born here, IMO, it doesn't make sense to live in NYC unless you want certain things. Sure, someone really into public/foreign service would do fine here - but DC is a city more tailored to that in the same way NYC really is tailored to people who want to be in, say, fashion or art.

Like 90% of the interesting places in NYC are completely accessible by subway, 24/7.

I'm guessing it's not IR-1/CR-1 as if it were, you could use the stamp in your passport to prove your status. If you don't yet have permanent residency approved then don't expect your green card to arrive in a timely manner as there are extensive delays across the board. Mine took 364 days.  File for an EAD (I-765) if you haven't already. It's free with certain green card applications and it doesn't take too long - 30 to 60 days generally, but can be up to 90.  p.s. it's generally a pretty bad idea to work under the table if you're not a resident/citizen."

You'll probably need to show evidence - bank statements and the like - but if successful it only takes a couple days. I expedited mine based on a job offer and I had my card within a week of calling my congressman. You do need to wait until you have the physical card in hand before you can work.

AskNYC,3cx5mt,coasts,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:20:57 2015 UTC,"You didn't say when you would be looking to eat.    If it's dinner tonight, then you're a very short walk away from Mission Chinese, an amazing Chinese fusion place that received NY Times's Best New Restaurant of the Year award a few years back.  If you're looking for brunch right now, I'd say walk up to Orchard and Broome and eat at either Dudley's or Barrio Chino.  You could try Pies n' Thighs for delicious fried chicken brunch diner-style.  Speaking of fried chicken, a real treat would be Birds & Bubbles, which is a champagne and southern cooking blend nearby.  .  Whatever you do, don't go to Dimes or Fat Radish: those are what we like to call ""honey pots""; they attract the douchebags to keep them from clogging up the truly great places nearby.  Kind of like a bug zapper for hipsters.  They serve an important and holy purpose but can sometimes pull innocent bystanders into their vortex.  (c.f. Houston Hall).  .  If you're looking for ""authentic"" chinatown food, ask someone else: to me the vast majority of it is super cheap but extremely low quality mystery meat.  There are notable exceptions like Wo Hop City, Peking Duck House, Xi'an Famous, and Red Egg.  But you really have to beware of the sketchy places."

AskNYC,3cqzeb,BintelBrief,15,Fri Jul 10 01:56:35 2015 UTC,"The subway system is being upgraded for wheelchair accessibility. It is progressing, although its a slow project.  So to a certain extent, it is possible to use the subway, if you live near an accessible station and also work near one. And the elevator is working (there's a website or an app that tells you whats going on with the elevators).  NYC provides on-demand transportation for people with a qualified disability (which being in a wheelchair obviously is) through a service called Para-Transit. You have to go in and get certified, after that you call for a ride (or set up a regular appointment) and they send a car or van and you pay the cost of a subway fare (2.75, unless a reduced fare applies).  Finally, there are larger, wheel-chair accessible cabs that can be hailed.  It is far from a perfect system that still has many frustrations but a person in a wheelchair can have a lot of freedom without the expense of a specially equipped car.  ""Elevator buildings"" are the norm in my area of queens -- you almost never see a walkup.  So that just depends where you are.   Now that covers getting around.  The neat thing about NYC is that everything delivers, and it isn't even more expensive most of the time, or not by a large margin.  restaurants, groceries, laundry, booze, anything from amazon... I broke my leg this winter and didn't leave my apartment for 6 weeks. It was no problem dealing with everyday stuff like food, laundry, etc.."
AskNYC,3cqzeb,cantcountnoaccount,4,Fri Jul 10 02:14:13 2015 UTC,"Hey  that Para-Transit sounds great! I'm sure she won't go out all the time for wild nights, but it's knowing she can if she wants to that I was worried about.  I can tell you put some time into the reply, so thanks!"

AskNYC,3cqzeb,chengjih,2,Fri Jul 10 13:35:11 2015 UTC,"This is basically what they do for the older bus types with stairs.  It's somewhat more inefficient compared to the newer bus types, since the driver has to get out, move to the back of the possibly crowded bus, operate the controls, etc.  With the newer ones, the driver doesn't have to get out of his seat."

Granted, she came to see Times Square and other tourist traps, and the crowds made things that much harder, but even the less crowded spots are a huge pain.  Most of the large subway stations have elevator access, but half the time the elevators are broken and smell like piss. Getting to the platform is only the first challenge. You still have to fight your way onto the train, which aren't exactly wheelchair friendly.  Keep in mind you don't have to live right in the city. You can live in one of the other boroughs like Brooklyn, Queens, or Staten Island. They don't have the same hustle & bustle of the city. Some areas are really no different than any other rural neighborhood with regular houses and yards, and easy car/van access, but you can still get to the city within 30 minutes.  Also /u/cantcountnoaccount is correct. Everyone here delivers. Even little corner convenience stores. You can literally have a bagel and a cup of coffee delivered to your place, or regular groceries like milk, eggs, bread, etc. That's one of the things that sold me on moving here. I visited a friend for a week, and I was amazed he could make a quick phone call and have anything he wanted delivered to his door within 15 minutes."

However I do think there's a big difference between being elderly and a tourist who may feel quite intimidated by the city, and being a person eager for independence who is eligible for services that are only available to residents and has some time to get used to the system.   I don't want to underplay the difficulties and frustrations, but they may be there in every locale to some extent. There are pluses and minuses to every situation.   Edit: Brooklyn, Queens and even Staten Island are right in the city, as they are all part of NYC."
AskNYC,3cqzeb,headzoo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:57:45 2015 UTC,"I agree there is a difference where age is concerned. I was actually giving that some thought. If you're a 20 something in a wheelchair you might even find ways to excel at city living. That being said, OP's grandmother is the one in the wheelchair. She'll face similar difficulties, and we didn't just release her on the city by herself. I was with her the whole time. She wasn't some tourist in a wheelchair having a hard time getting around by herself.  Also the same girlfriend had a 8mo kid. God, I know the hell of dealing with a stroller in the city.

She is a super independent lady, just has a helper a couple days of week to clean and do laundry (which she could easily send out but refuses to).  I apologize if I overstressed the difference being age. The difference is being a resident, and therefore, having access to disability specific services.

AskNYC,3cp0g8,daupo,3,Thu Jul 9 18:36:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry, don't know about payroll aside from direct deposit. They are what used to be called a labor bank, meaning they cater to the little guy. They keep their fees reasonable, at least compared to the big boys. My family has been banking with them since the late '20s so I might be a bit biased."

AskNYC,3cmi3d,realdujour,6,Thu Jul 9 01:40:30 2015 UTC,I have used brokers in the past and probably will again in the future. I usually do so because I am short on time or have specific demands in neighborhoods where a connected broker can go a long way. I refuse to pay more than one month's rent. I only go with brokers I know or am recommended.
AskNYC,3cmi3d,paratactical,9,Thu Jul 9 01:43:41 2015 UTC,Paid one month's rent as fee.   I have never heard anyone logically support the 'I will never pay a broker's fee' position.

Many, many people can afford to live in NYC who will find it difficult to come up with an extra month's rent, especially if it's short notice. 4x rent to move in is quite a bit for many people to have on hand who otherwise could afford to live a decent life here.  edit: what a beautiful example of both the boot theory, and also the complete ignorance that the upper class has of the middle and lower class."

Needing an extra month's rent on short notice is the antithesis of sticking to a budget,    This is something that you plan for in advance because you know your rent will increase and it is a possibility that you may have to move.

AskNYC,3cmi3d,lavenuma,3,Thu Jul 9 16:13:15 2015 UTC,Paid between a month and a half month's rent for the apartments I've rented. Both times it was well worth it - the broker basically handled the entire application process for me. I'd use one again to line up a bunch of apartments and figure out what I'm looking for.
AskNYC,3cmi3d,Carwheel,3,Thu Jul 9 03:22:07 2015 UTC,"15% is the typical fee for me, and what we charge at my office. Sometimes we include application fees.  I don't mind coming down towards 10-12% after some negotiating.  If a landlord likes a particular application better than another and the potential tenant tells us that they can only do one month as a fee, we will accept it.   Something to keep in mind is the fee is not all going directly to the showing broker. We have to divide the commission with our sponsoring brokerage as well as if the apartment had a different listing agent. Also, we have to be paid for every client visit that didn't work out, and all of the dealing involved with those clients. And then there are the unavoidable expenses such as advertising and marketing, transportation, etc."
AskNYC,3cmi3d,venniblue,2,Thu Jul 9 03:33:05 2015 UTC,"I've pretty much used a broker each time after searching no-fee and seeing a lot of bullshit apartments. Being driven around to 4-6 places in a day and letting appointments be their problem is worth it, plus the quality of places has always been better from brokers.  I'm in queens and we've paid 12%. One broker tried to hit us for 15% and we were like lol, no dawg, look around you this is still Queens not Far NorthEastern Williamsburg or whatever broker bs  you're trying to scam college kids with.   We actually found our last broker because we had an appointment to see a place from a rando, he stood us up and while we stood there fuming another broker strolled up with some clients and we liked his hustle."
AskNYC,3cmi3d,cantcountnoaccount,2,Thu Jul 9 16:06:43 2015 UTC,"I paid a one-month's rent fee for a 1BR on the UES. It came out to (obviously) about 8% of the annual rent. Broker owned the Craigslist listing, I stalked him on Yelp and met him in person, decided it sounded fine and had a good experience overall.  I am FULLY against the broker fee thing, it's a completely bullshit economy that has no reason to exist, but my circumstances changed on short notice (had to live/pay on my own instead of with girlfriend), so I couldn't afford any of the ""luxury"" buildings that have their own leasing team and needed to play the game in order to have a place to live.  So, in other words, I had to use a broker in order to open up the inventory that was in my price range. It still felt like a ripoff, but it got me into a nice Manhattan 1BR with high ceilings and tons of windows for $1700/month ($1841/month if you amortize the broker fee), and I was simply not able to find anything like that among the no-fee listings."
AskNYC,3cmi3d,CharethCutestorie,3,Thu Jul 9 18:26:13 2015 UTC,"Every broker will come down to a month's rent for the fee. If they won't, they're lying, or they're some form of broker I've never heard of."
AskNYC,3cmi3d,sonofaresiii,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:29:47 2015 UTC,"I paid a 13.5% broker fee - it was a cobroke so the brokers split the fee, and our broker took a slight hit on their fee since the other broker would not budge.  We initially did not want to pay the fee, but we were quickly seeing that paying the fee was going to get us a WAY better apartment. Been there almost 3 years, hoping to sign another 2 year lease.  The broker was well worth our money. Physically helped us move in, coordinated the painting of the apartment, and when the apartment was sold to new owners, he was the broker managing it and really went to bat for us with the new owners. Great brokers are totally worth it. There are a LOT of crappy/shady ones."

AskNYC,3cmi3d,Something_Sexy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:02:04 2015 UTC,"No real issues other than us being unsure if the new owners would want to keep us as tenants, and needing to keep our apartment clean for showings while we were at work. The new owners wanted to raise the rent to help bring the apartment rent back up to market prices (previous owner hadn't raised rent in 4 years). However, between all the nice things the broker had told them about us and us negotiating with the owner/landlord, it worked out fine."
AskNYC,3cmi3d,princessbr0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:11:18 2015 UTC,"A casual acquaintance of mine is a broker, so I negotiated with him up front for 10% instead of 15%.  It still killed me to pay the fee though, which ended up being 1.5 months rent. I really wanted to find a no-fee apartment but I was working full-time and really didn't have the time to do it on my own.  In the future I would avoid using a broker if at all possible."
AskNYC,3cmi3d,PeroxidePoofter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:35:53 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on where you are renting because I have only paid 1 months rent (in Astoria). Friends in Manhattan (UES, East Village) have paid the 15%. Overall I suggest a broker/agent since they can show you multiple apartments and a lot of landlords won't talk to you directly. I'm looking for a new place now too. Good luck!"
AskNYC,3cmi3d,lfinfin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:53:12 2015 UTC,"In my experience it is almost always negotiable to one month's rent. But I'm very anti-brokers fee. If you search hard and well, you WILL find something. Then again I only do BK, so maybe that's exclusive to BK."
AskNYC,3cmi3d,lavenuma,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"I paid one month's rent and was happy to do it. I used StreetEasy to scope out apartments in the neighborhoods I was interested in, called the listing agents, set up appointments to view the properties that day, put in an application for an apartment in a co-op building on the first day of my search, signed a lease 3 days later.  Coming from out of state, I can't really imagine not going through a broker/agent. It may be different if you're already living here and have the luxury of walking the streets looking for availability signs on buildings and dealing directly with management/owners. I guess I'd do that if I had a lot of time to shop around."

I've always paid brokers fee, although not over 1 months rent. The reason why I pay brokers fee is because I am very particular about certain things - ie: I have to be less than 5 minutes away from the train station, I have to be less than 20 minutes away from mid town Manhattan, there must be at least one 24 hour grocery store and pharmacy within 5 minutes of my apartment, there has to be a laundromat on my block or in my building, my apartment has to be over 400 square feet etc. What I want is on the pricier side, but I'm absolutely willing to pay for this."
AskNYC,3cmi3d,aceshighsays,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:58:43 2015 UTC,"I've never paid a broker's fee. I've been willing to and have been shown apartments by brokers, but I always ended up finding something I liked more on my own.

If you're truly concerned about clogging the drain with fat from the broth, allow it to fully cool, remove the fat with a spoon and pour the rest down the drain.  Then you can throw the solids in the trash and the liquids down the drain.  This is far more environmentally friendly and should be something you're doing anyway.    Also, cooking oil and grease are far different from broth.  Cooking oil is fat, while broth is mostly water.  If you're frying things, allow the frying oil to cool completely and then throw it in the garbage.  Things like bacon fat can be stored and used for later cooking applications.

AskNYC,3cmdlm,yarko3,9,Thu Jul 9 01:04:03 2015 UTC,"Canadian expat here, here's your to-do:  You will need:   a USD-based bank account, get one from your Canadian bank before you leave. Stuff it with all the damn cash you can scrounge up. You will need to be able to cough up a cashier's cheque in $USD on-demand. credit cards with plenty of limit, you will be spending a lot of money before you're done. up to date credit report from Canada. Most landlords will not accept this, but you might get lucky.   Presumably your company is setting you up with a TN visa, they will let you know what you need to have/do for that, but in case your lawyers suck:   original copy of your degree sealed academic transcript (grab a few copies, this is relevant for a surprising number of things) offer letter and TN application package - your employer will prepare this for you proof of enough money to survive (bank statements, mostly)   There are a few gotchas with that visa you should be aware of when crossing the border:   be careful of your language, using the wrong words may result in your work visa being denied you must not express any intent to stay in the US permanently. If questioned about staying, state unambiguously that you intend to return to Canada upon the expiration of your work visa. do not refer to yourself or your job in a way that doesn't line up with your TN category. For example, if your TN application is under the category of ""Computer Systems Analyst"", refer to yourself as such, and avoid other titles like ""Engineer"" or ""Programmer"". do not use the word programmer at all, programmers are not permitted on TN visas. If questioned about whether or not you are a programmer or will be programming, state that programming may be incidental to your duties, which is primarily an analyst/engineer/whatever. if your degree is in CS, try to avoid describing yourself as an Engineer. The USCIS does not consider a Science/Math degree valid qualification to perform engineering. If your company/law firm tries to give you an ""Engineer"" title in the visa application, verify this with them, it's generally troublesome. beware of your port of entry, some checkpoints (see: Ottawa) are friendlier and less likely to reject you than others (see: Toronto, Vancouver). Your law firm should advise you on the best port to travel through, but some law firms are not so good. finally, the US immigration system is positively Kafkaesque and is confusing as fuck and will drive you up the wall. Sorry. Don't lose your cool, even if the system is fucking insane and you have every right to scream at it. The border guard processing your TN application will likely treat you like subhuman dirt and find every way to poke holes in your application. Just act like a scared little bitch, that's the reaction they want to see to fulfill their power-tripping egos and let you get on your way.   Here's what you should do immediately upon entering the US:   as soon as you enter the country, go to your local Social Security Office to apply for your SSN. You will need this damn number for everything that follows, so do this immediately. You will need the I-94 from your work authorization. Consult this for details. open a bank account with a local bank. Most will require a SSN before allowing you to do so, but ask your company, other Canadians, etc, to see if there's a bank that's willing to do without - it's entirely legal, just normal bank policy. If you can open a bank account without a SSN, do so as soon as possible - if you can, before you start work (take a short trip down, say). You can open an account without a permanent address, just fill in whatever will get you past the system. put your money in your shiny new bank account. Everything is easier from a US bank instead of a Canadian one. Srsly. switch your cell phone. You will have no credit history in the US, which makes your life difficult. You might not even have a SSN yet - which is the standard ID used to pull your credit report. Many cell phone plans will not be available to you initially, but fortunately most carriers have post-paid plans - equivalent to the normal plans but they will force you to pay at the beginning of each billing period, and if you miss a single bill they will cut you off. find housing, duh. This is a bigger can of worms I'll leave to other people. Just be aware that a lot of stuff in this process will require personal cheques and cashier's cheques - so make sure your US bank account is all good to go in time, or that you have Canadian banks capable of doing this.   Here's what you should do within your first month or two:   get a secured credit card. US banks are oddly enough very averse to handing out credit cards to people without a credit history. They are more afraid of you than they are afraid of people with actually bad credit. There are secured credit cards that will force you to deposit the monthly limit, which you forfeit if you miss a payment. This is bullshit, clearly, but you will have to bite the damn bullet. Within a few months of paying the bills diligently, you'll have enough credit in the US to get a real credit card. Not having credit is a huge pain in the ass everywhere you go, get this done as soon as you can and start building credit immediately."
AskNYC,3cmdlm,potatolicious,2,Thu Jul 9 04:37:20 2015 UTC,"A very good post. To add a few things:   With no SSN you won't be able to go through a US credit check, and without that you might not be able to apply for leases. Still even if you do, you might get asked for 4-6 months security deposit. When you apply for SSN make sure you ask them for a receipt. It will be a stamped, dated piece of paper. I think they don't normally issue this unless you ask. TD opens a bank acct without a SSN (they use all 8s instead). Accounts can be linked (through a Canadian branch or over the phone) and you can wire money between them free of charge. BTW you might be able to open a US TD account from Canada but I'm not 100℅ sure. Don't take WestJet. You can get unlimited roaming on Wind for an additional $15/month. This is a decent deal until you get a US plan. Be mindful that data at ""regular"" speeds is capped at 1GB in roaming, after which it gets throttled."

For banks and phones you'll need to find branches/shops that will let you open an account without a SSN, which is not super difficult but may take a few tries.  You don't even need to come all the way down to NYC - a bank account opened in Niagara is as good as one opened here in the city, ditto cell phones."

There are plenty of dog runs in the city where you can let your little fur ball off its leash to run free in an enclosed space. I don't know why you're looking for a farm, there are plenty of people with dog of all sizes in nyc. And as far as riding the train into town, this city is huge, what part are you working in, where do you plan on living, and why can't you have your dog there."
AskNYC,3cmwyl,convergecult13,2,Thu Jul 9 13:20:19 2015 UTC,"Central Park has some designated off-leash areas, and the city also has some good fenced-in dog runs (Wash Sq Park and Thompkins Sq Park come to mind).    There are also tons of dog walkers and doggy daycare facilities.  In pretty much all of the surrounding suburbs (CT, Westchester, Long Island) you can generally find public opens space areas or hiking trails that will allow dogs.

Queens is part of the city.   New York City is exactly that, a city. If you are looking to live on a farm, it will not be close to the city.

AskNYC,3cmwyl,cantcountnoaccount,2,Fri Jul 10 22:49:00 2015 UTC,"unless another redditor contradicts me, i believe what you're asking for does not really exist near New york city with the transportation time you're asking. Fact of the matter is, legit farm land are all driving distance from the city. Any train you're thinking of is going to take a massive amount of time to commute in. if your concern is finding acres of land for your dog to run aroudn in, you're goign to have to pick between that and maintaining a life in the city. I have a dog, and i do what the rest of the urbanites do around here which is take her to the park during off leash hours and let her run around. Because I have a 9-5 job, i caved in and paid a dog walker to take her out in the middle of the day. There are decent dog parks around, but nothing really with acres of land. If you live close to prospect park in brooklyn, or central park in manhattan, forest park in queens, these are large parks that a dog can run around in during off leash hours. Staten Island has a ton of parks, but you would be dependent on a ferry to commute in (which a lot of people claim isn't so bad, haven't done it myself)."
AskNYC,3cmwyl,centech,2,Thu Jul 9 05:05:26 2015 UTC,Answer c: Farms don't exist in the city.   If you're extremely lucky you can hope for a ground floor apartment with a small fenced backyard. And that will cost you. A home with land on a subway line? Not gonna happen.  You can consider some of the Hudson River towns on the Metro-North commuter rail  like Hastings and Tarrytown but even there anything walkable to the train will just be a home with a backyard. You would need to have a car and get outside of the town center to get anything that feel rural. And it's pricey: The monthly pass is around $300.
AskNYC,3cmwyl,ilexVomitoria,2,Thu Jul 9 12:26:02 2015 UTC,I... I don't understand the question. You want to buy a farm near NYC? You are looking for some sort of public farm that dogs can play on?

They don't go to farms every day. They go for walks around the neighborhood or to one of 1,700 parks inside the city. Even if all of those parks don't have provisions specifically for dogs, NYC is pretty darn dog-friendly from what I've seen.  I was born and raised on a farm and I can assure you my folks would not have appreciated strangers showing up and letting their dogs run loose on the property without permission.   You don't need access to a farm to have a happy dog, you just need to be a conscientious dog owner."

AskNYC,3cmwyl,cantcountnoaccount,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:06:38 2015 UTC,"I’m not sure if you mean you want to move to a farm within commuting distance of NYC or you are looking for some sort of “open farm” sort of situation where you can visit and let your dog play, also within train travel distance.   Also, are farms in general for rent (as opposed to leasing farmland), or are you looking to purchase a full farm? I’m not going to make any assumptions, for all I know you are independently wealthy.   I am not wholly familiar with suburban areas, but might I suggest looking at the towns in Long Island where the LIRR goes through? I am sure the more east you go there’s more open space. I’m not sure about farms in particular.   But as many have said, NYC is extremely dog friendly. So many dog parks, dog walkers, dog-friendly outdoor seating restaurants, dog-inclusive outdoor public events, doggy daycare, etc. etc. I unfortunately can’t partake in any of the above because my dog happens to be very antisocial, but if he was, I’d be at all of them."

Would also inquire as to whether the dog is paper/pad-trained or crate-trained to go outside, and lean toward the latter because it is a sign of a more responsible dog owner.  Lot of ppl with small dogs (especially older folks) in the city train them to pee on pads inside the house, rather than to only go outside.  This is kinda gross and is more likely to result in the place smelling like dog pee (we've also had issues with pee-pads being thrown out in the trash room without being bagged properly in my building - smells terrible).  Would also ask about whether prospective tenant is getting a dog walker, or plans on taking dog to doggy daycare.  Either would be good indications that they're not going to leave dog alone in apartment all day everyday to potentially bark and pee.

Then the return ferry makes a mandatory stop over at Ellis Island, etc. Staten Island Ferry: if you are already actually visiting the Statue of Liberty using the Statue of Liberty tickets, then doing the Staten Island Ferry isn't necessary TOTR is preferred over ESB, because it has nicer views and has less of a line.

TOTR will also give you better views of midtown, FT better views of FIDI.    Lots of good falafal in NYC.  Mamouns is very well known but probably not the best.  Try Taim or google around a bit more.  Prosperity dumplings is good and definitely the cheapest, but there are better options out there if you don't mind spending another dollar or two.    Bar None for Saints, not really a sports bar but they take over the back room for that.  Basically any bar for the Jets.

Like Jamaica Line, Nassau Street Line, 8th Ave Line, Broadway Line, etc. This is manly due to its history, dating back over a century.  We have routes that travel on these lines. Those are the letters and numbers, A,B,C,D,E,F,G,J,L,M,N,Q,R,S,Z,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.   For example, the J train travels on the Jamaica line and Essex Line. The A train travels on the 8th Avenue line and Fulton St line.   We now only identify a route by its letter or number, NOT by which line it travels on. Sound confusing, and it is.

Forget the NYC noise code ""guidelines"" or whatever, check out the actual law for yourself:  http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/pdf/law05113.pdf  You can check through for yourself and see if there are any clauses that might apply, but the relevant bit as near as I can tell is subsection 24-218 General prohibitions  which, (can't copy/paste) basically states that so long as something is less than 10db above ambient noise and between the hours of 7am to 10pm, it's permitted.  I bolded out the 7am, because if your guy starts at 7am, he probably knows the exact law he's working under and knows he's legal. You can call for an inspection if you really want, but chances are the dude is under 10db above ambient.  So you're probably not going to have much luck getting him to stop. However, and I know this can be a tad annoying... I highly recommend earplugs. It's a noisy damn city out there and noisy shit keeping you up/waking you up is pretty common around here...

AskNYC,3cii5f,HODOR00,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:17:46 2015 UTC,"The actual problem with this is telling police you think someone has it isn't enough evidence for them to go through someone's apartment to check. Maybe the cops will scare the person into admitting it (likely some form of ""Oh I didn't know I wasn't supposed to take it, here ya go"") but if they say they don't have it, the police can't do anything."
AskNYC,3cii5f,sonofaresiii,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:33:08 2015 UTC,"oh yeah, I agree.  I was kinda meaning like, if you have the video that supposedly exists, would be pretty easy to prove who took it.  You could even just pretend you have them on tape and see if they give in."

AskNYC,3cjd9u,nxqv,2,Thu Jul 9 02:11:28 2015 UTC,"Craigslist is an obvious alternative, but AirBnB puts your money in escrow which is extremely important. I had a woman I was renting from try to screw me over (the building was being shut down because it wasn't up to fire code so I was being kicked out early and she wouldn't refund me), but I contacted customer service at AirBnB and they refunded me with no hassle. They charge a commission so it'll be slightly more expensive, but with your budget you'll be fine."
AskNYC,3cjd9u,curiiouscat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:59:55 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I'm wary of. Everything I've seen is around the 3k mark (should have mentioned its for 2ppl). Craigslist just seems so dodgy!
AskNYC,3cjd9u,curiiouscat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:27:16 2015 UTC,"I've honestly never had a single issue with the people I rent from on Craigslist, and I've sublet a few times. The only issue was when I was on AirBnB, but that was a total coincidence. You pay more for peace of mind, I guess."

AskNYC,3cjchr,pfeper,2,Wed Jul 8 13:27:57 2015 UTC,"T-Mobile and its subsidiary Metro-PCS is cheap and gets great coverage within cities.  I have an unlimited everything plan for $80/mo.   Of course, outside of the cities the coverage is shit."
AskNYC,3cjchr,Unoriginal_UserName9,3,Wed Jul 8 15:14:17 2015 UTC,"I second all of the above. T-Mobile is great in NYC.  In some places outside the city, your phone will roam on AT&T. Though data is limited."

From talking to people, it seems like Verizon is probably the best provider to have nationwide.  However, I did hear good things recently about T-Mobile. It used to be shit (people called T-Ghetto), but I heard they stepped up their game in NYC recently. Should be considerably cheaper than Verizon also."

Do you plan to rent? Live alone? And so on...  So it's hard to make a accurate comparison.   I will say this. If I were single, had no family to support and was making 150k a year. I would be more than comfortable with living in NYC alone."
AskNYC,3cii22,Tip718,8,Wed Jul 8 04:27:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is unquestionably a financial upgrade.  With very few exceptions, anytime you can more than double your existing salary and subsequently vault yourself well into the 6-figure range it is a no-brainer.    Also consider that in addition to your massive salary increase, NYC is likely also a better opportunity for future growth.  Lastly, from a career standpoint - it is always, always, always beneficial to take a big pay jump like this - because even if you don't stay at this job for the rest of your life, it will serve as a starting point for future negotiations."
AskNYC,3cii22,LawyersGunsAndKony,2,Wed Jul 8 13:00:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's unquestionably a financial upgrade. Northern Florida has some if the cheapest costs of living in the US. 65k is a VERY good salary there. His rental costs will quintuple at least if he wants to have a 2BR and walk to work. He may need to pay heat and electricity will be about triple. In addition to other moving costs, he'll need a complete winter wardrobe from the ground up. If he intends to keep a car, insurance and parking will take a big bite.  Not to say it's a bad deal. But it may afford about the same quality if life. (Financially). :p"
AskNYC,3cii22,cantcountnoaccount,2,Wed Jul 8 15:21:29 2015 UTC,Electric should be about the same. In FL you have to run the AC most of the year.
AskNYC,3cii22,FirstLadyOfBeer,2,Wed Jul 8 15:56:35 2015 UTC,"I meant the per kWh price. Correction: It's actually about double: NYC 20c vs 11c Florida. That means your basic items that draw electricity, such as fridge, computer, tv, coffee maker etc all cost double to operate."
AskNYC,3cii22,cantcountnoaccount,2,Wed Jul 8 16:04:14 2015 UTC,"But he won't be running the AC 8-10 months a year. We lived in Tampa for 6 months in their ""winter"" and I think the AC was only off for maybe 1 month."
AskNYC,3cii22,FirstLadyOfBeer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:11:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that will be replaced by running the AC 3-4 months and running the heat for 5-6."
AskNYC,3cii22,paratactical,3,Wed Jul 8 16:48:43 2015 UTC,"With $150K salary, assuming decent credit and no previous evictions, you'd easily find (and qualify for) decent close-to-work apartment in the $2000~$3750 range. Cost of living is higher, but your salary increase compensates for that. Depending on your spending, after expenses you should also be able to squirrel away about $20K-$30K / year in the bank.   Making friends in NY varies. Don't be shy. I've met many people and made countless friends/acquaintances via young professional social events hosted by various religious and cultural organizations. You could also join a sports team through meetup.com or another activity."
AskNYC,3cii22,realdujour,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:19:05 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say if it would be a financial upgrade but I think it would be. I'm guessing two miles is a 5-10 minute commute? If so, and if you're living by yourself and working in, say, midtown Manhattan, you can probably assume you're paying at least $2500 or so a month in rent. Your taxes are also going way up and you're paying more for food, and there are a lot more things to spend money on here. But I think you'd still be making more. As for making friends, it's no harder than anywhere else. People might say otherwise, but usually those are people moving here when the only other place they lived was a dorm."

As far as making friends, my rule of thumb is that it takes about a year to have a solid group of reliable acquaintances that are on the way to becoming real friends. People are busy here and have a lot of things competing for their time and attention and it just takes a while. Now that doesn't mean you won't have socialization time. You just have to pick a few things (a bar, a meetup group, an intramural sports league, an open mic, etc) and become a regular. You will find good friends eventually, but it takes time."

AskNYC,3chlm9,helpful_grey,9,Tue Jul 7 23:55:08 2015 UTC,Is it just me or does a 5% increase not sound like a lot?
AskNYC,3chlm9,dollyparts,3,Wed Jul 8 03:33:55 2015 UTC,"it's above market, but given how fast rents can rise overnight here, it's not a shocking figure at all."
AskNYC,3chlm9,orksnork,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:24:20 2015 UTC,"Given our rent, it comes out about 60+ bucks  more per month per roommate.  It's not devastating but definitely not chump change especially if you were already on the upper tier of your rent budget.  I had posted a question a while back about why we were having so much trouble filling a room in our apartment - the overwhelming consensus seemed to be that it is overpriced.  We are talking over 1400/room in a four bedroom split in the west 100's.  It's way too much, but I imagine the Columbia student population keeps the demand flowing."
AskNYC,3chlm9,orksnork,2,Wed Jul 8 11:06:31 2015 UTC,4800 in manhattan for a 4 bedroom? that's not that crazy.
AskNYC,3chlm9,aceshighsays,2,Wed Jul 8 20:56:05 2015 UTC,1400 x 4 = 5600
AskNYC,3chlm9,AnneFrankenstein,3,Wed Jul 8 22:44:10 2015 UTC,still not bad? it's certainly not even three times the cost of an average 1br
AskNYC,3chlm9,aceshighsays,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:32:35 2015 UTC,It's not a lot at all. My last apartment was rent stabalized and they increased it by ~8% both times.

AskNYC,3chlm9,aceshighsays,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:25:59 2015 UTC,"Yup, I was paying preferential rate. The difference between the preferential rate and legal rate was $700. The lesson that I learned was that there was no point in getting a rent stabilized apartment because they still can increase the rent an absurd amount."
AskNYC,3chlm9,jogden2015,3,Wed Jul 8 12:28:46 2015 UTC,"Also pull out your lease and see if there's legal rent and preferential rent. If they're charging you less than the max they could, and have told you so, that changes the situation as well."
AskNYC,3chlm9,NB_991,3,Wed Jul 8 00:01:13 2015 UTC,"Not all apartments in rent stabilized buildings are rent stabilized. Your apartment needs to be rent stabilized not the building.  Are you paying the preferential rate? If you are, they case raise your rent to the legal rent."
AskNYC,3chlm9,AnneFrankenstein,2,Wed Jul 8 01:44:05 2015 UTC,what are you paying?  more than 2K?
AskNYC,3chlm9,jogden2015,2,Wed Jul 8 00:20:06 2015 UTC,"Yes - it is a four bedroom over 5K, split between four people."
AskNYC,3chlm9,Usrname52,9,Wed Jul 8 00:41:31 2015 UTC,"Very unlikely that it’s rent stabilized, considering the cutoff point for high-rent vacancy deregulation is $2,500. Other apartments in your building are presumably rent stabilized."
AskNYC,3chlm9,jogden2015,0,Wed Jul 8 00:58:36 2015 UTC,It's still possible that the units rent was increased to an illegal starting point when their tenancy started.   I would look into that.

AskNYC,3cgzaj,menschmaschine5,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:40:04 2015 UTC,"I've met people here who paid 6 months to a full year of rent in advance. It's not just that you need to show that you have the money, they are actually going to want you to hand it over. Housing here is extremely competitive, and landlords have no incentive to choose you over someone who has not only good credit, but proof of income. You could have a parent or someone close to you sign as a guarantor, especially since you'll be a student, but they'll need to make 80x the rent. So, if you expect to pay $2,000 per month, your guarantor would need to make $160,000 per year.  My wife and I moved here 5 years ago for grad school and used student loans to supplement the money we had saved to get by. I DO NOT recommend this. Only do this if you have no other option. We've got a shit ton of student debt, and we went to public universities.   I'd highly recommend the roommate option. We moved here from across the country, and managed to find two amazing roommates on Craigslist who accepted us as a couple, and our dog too. Having roommates also kept us from feeling lonely and was a good start for building social lives here. New York can feel very lonely in those long winter months, and coming home to friendly faces can make life much better.  Edit: Just saw the no guarantor part, sorry."

AskNYC,3cf4vy,throwawaynycgal9999,3,Tue Jul 7 12:47:21 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Washington Heights and taught in Morningside Heights so I know both neighborhoods very well.  Washington Heights, contrary to popular belief, is one of the safest neighborhoods in Manhattan. It's not a posh address so you can get a place cheap. But, if you're looking for a ""vibrant"" neighborhood, you won't find it. I lived on 164th by the hospital and there was barely a single bar for miles around, and not many nice restaurants either. It's a pretty family-oriented community, and not many young, single people move there unless they're studying or working at NY Presbyterian, so it's a bit isolating. That said, the people in the neighborhood are by and large very nice from my experience, and it has a real ""neighborhoody"" feel similar to what you might find in smaller Brooklyn neighborhoods. However I often had trouble getting friends to visit me up there, especially female friends, not just because it was far but because they ""felt"" unsafe in the neighborhood... take that how you will.  Morningside Heights definitely has the younger vibe, with lots of bars and restaurants to boot because of the proximity to Columbia. If you're in your early 20's this is great, though any older than that and it may be a bit more of a challenge to ""fit in."" Your commute to East Harlem will be shorter, as will your commute downtown. For the most part it feels like a college atmosphere around Columbia which I definitely appreciated, and during warm weather they also have events there like street fairs which you don't usually see in Washington Heights.  Hope that helps."

There are much better supermarkets, restaurants and shopping options. The subway transportation is about comparable to Washington Heights, though you will have an easier time getting to your school and internship from Morningside.  I live on the edge of Washington Heights - it's fine, but if I had an option in Morningside, I'd go for that. Washington Heights is limited in its amenities. It's definitely developing all the time, but the student Mecca in Morningside has developed it already. Washington Heights is marginally less safe, and the grocery and restaurant options are more limited."

AskNYC,3cf4vy,carpy22,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:42:32 2015 UTC,"Bit late to the party, but my suggestion would be Morningside Heights. I've lived both places, and I'm currently in South Harlem (though I often work out of Morningside Heights and my wife works up in Washington Heights). From a general atmosphere perspective, I prefer Morningside Heights because you're sandwiched between Riverside and Morningside, and you've got Columbia's campus, and are pretty near Central Park. More stores/restaurants, etc.   I'd consider both places a normal level of safe, which means 99% of the time nothing will happen to you. The only crime-related thing that's ever happened to us in NYC was my wife getting mugged while reading her kindle on one of the benches overlooking Morningside Park, in the middle of the afternoon. She wasn't hurt and they just took her phone. They weren't big readers.  But for me, the biggest thing would be commuting. Washington Heights -> East Harlem is pain in the ass. Even Morningside Heights -> East Harlem will take time. It's either bus or feet, both of which are by no means terrible, but it's a lot more effort than just jumping on the subway and going a few stops. Re: heading downtown/elsewhere, when I lived off the 1, I thought it was great, but I didn't know any better. Now that I've lived near the 2 and the A, I finally found out what a pain in the ass the 1 is."
AskNYC,3cdz5y,norestforthewicked_,7,Tue Jul 7 04:13:47 2015 UTC,"First thing that's probably getting your resume shitcanned is a non-NYC address on it.  If you have a HI address on there, take it off and leave your email and phone.  Maybe even take your phone number off of it if it has that area code.  I work in a different industry, but when I'm hiring and get a resume from out of state, it's an immediate toss.  Not what I want to do, but it's true.  What do you want to do here?  Does AmeriCorps have help with placement services in the city?  As a thought experiment, what would you be willing to do until you get the job you want?  Bar back, be an UberRush delivery person, or maybe Amazon Now?  You have a degree in broadcast communications. Have you been applying to every radio and TV broadcaster in this state?  Here's a list of all the radio stations -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_radio_stations_in_New_York  and all the TV stations -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_television_stations_in_New_York  What are your skills - are you on air talent, producer type, researcher, editor, good at transcribing, audio/video technician?  There are probably many jobs here for you, and while the first one may not be the one you always dreamed of, that's the one that gets you in the loop and meeting people that will take you to the next fork in the road where you actually have a choice to make.  The one piece of advice I can give you is to make yourself indispensable and fun to work with.  Reputation and how people recommend each other is a huge part of job getting and shifting here.  If you're lazy or a fuckhead to be around, people will talk about this and not want to work with you.  If you work hard and make the workplace enjoyable, you're way ahead of the game.    I wish you the best of luck!  When I moved here with no job or apartment many years ago, everyone said ""that place will eat you up!"".  They were fucking wrong, and if you take that negative slogan to heart, that this place is too scary or weird, that's wrong, too.  You can make it here, you just have to open your mind, get creative, be motivated, and get ready for a life as you've never known it. I have faith in you.

NYC is a very tough job market.  My advice to you is this: Apply to as many jobs as possible, even jobs that aren't exactly what you want to do. Find a friend with an NYC address and use that on your resume. Expect people to not be interested anymore if you can't come in for an interview within a week/week and a half.

AskNYC,3ccmh4,scriboniuslargus,7,Mon Jul 6 21:35:47 2015 UTC,"These are both drink and draw figure drawing type events that I've been to, if you are into that sort of thing:  Draw Mania happens usually twice a month (on a Sunday and a Thursday night) at Otto's Shrunken Head on 14th st. It's $15 for a  4 hour long event. It's pretty loose and fun. They usually have a few models (male and female) posing at the same time, for various amounts of time stating at 10 seconds to 20 minutes. In between models sets they generally have mini 10 minute sets for musicians, comedians or dancers. It's really cool and a lot of fun. You can find out more about them through their meetup group (http://www.meetup.com/FigureSketching-NYC/). I think the group also hosts a few other figure drawing events in city, but I've only done the ""Draw Mania"" ones.  The other one I've only just been to for the first time last week. QED Astoria in Queens hosts a drink and draw figure drawing event once a month. It's $10 for 3 hours. One model doing various poses starting from 10 seconds to 20 minutes. If you pay for your ticket ahead of time you get a free drink.   Neither event offers any kind of instruction. They are very relaxed and welcoming of artists of all skill levels. The space in Queens is slightly less crowded than Otto's Shrunken head, but both can fill up fast. I would definitely recommend getting to these events 20 minutes early to get a good spot.   *Edit: Looks like Draw Mania raised their price to $20. I'd say it is still worth it though."

AskNYC,3cdn0z,vintagetennis,3,Tue Jul 7 02:26:39 2015 UTC,"First, it's usually not cold in NYC in September, so fuck the dress warmly thing. You're here for fashion week. You have to dress well.  Second, everywhere you're likely to say is safe. Manhattan / Williamsburg, but probably Manhattan. I don't know why you would actually want to stay somewhere touristy, but that's on you.  Third, Fashion Week all the good shit you need an ""in"" too. Excel sheets with a list of all the closed stuff go out a week or two before. It's like any other event, like Cannes Film Fest or Lions. Different brands have different levels of exclusivity. If some of your photographer group are hot females, or you are friends with some of the models or designers you are shooting, this will help. If you're covering it from a press angle, you're likely more out of luck. Don't go in packs; groups of 2-3 at most. Nothing will guarantee you more not getting in than showing up in a huge group.  Tribeca / Soho / Noho / Flat Iron / Grammercy is where I'd stay. If you can budget it, stay somewhere that has some entertainment options which your room key will help with, since you won't know any of the door guys. For example, The Standard, Gramemrcy Hotel, or Bowery Hotel. A group of five guys aren't getting in during fashion week. If you're staying there, that's a different story. Also, we have some nice rooftop places.  Safe and touristy is ""Times Square"" but that sucks (there are big hotels with lots of rooms who will probably do group rates). And is arguably not as safe as the other places. Touristy and safe don't go together in my mind. Though overall, NYC is the safest large city in the world. ESB / Midtown is touristy, but the hotels are hit or miss (a lot of cheap shitholes, with one or two nice ones like the Andaz, Langham, Refinery). The only reason to do this is if you know you're going to be doing long shifts at Lincoln Center, and then need to drop gear at your hotel before hitting after parties. Then figure out where your after parties are, where you're going to be during the day, and book something in the middle. There are great hotels everywhere, but usually they start at $300/day and during events like Fashion Week, the good ones start at like $600. Grammercy Park Hotel, The Nomad, The Ace, The Standard, Sixty Thomson, Ganseevort (too clubby), Trump Soho, Hudson Hotel, Soho Grand, Tribeca Grand, Crosby Street Hotel, Viceroy, Morgans, Hotel on Rivington, Andaz, Refinery, The Mark, Bowery Hotel (really great during fashion week), Nolitan, Greenwich Hotel, these are all like cooler downtown; and then you can do classic uptown like the Plaza, Pierre, Waldorf, Mandarin Oriental, etc..  can do Wythe in Williamsburg  The difference between NY Fashion Week and all the others is that for that week, in every other city you'll go to, it is literally the most important if not the only thing going on (except maybe London). In NYC, most people will not give a shit. Fashion tries to be a big deal and bars/clubs/parties will be hopping, but it's ultimately a very small part of our economy. So you're competing against not only everyone else from Fashion, but all the bankers/finance, marketing/advertising, tech, art, film/tv/media/entertainment, etc...

As far as events go - would work really hard to get invites ahead of time to some events (especially early in the week) and then just meet people and network - try to get invites to other stuff etc...

AskNYC,3cdren,lostineverythin,8,Tue Jul 7 03:03:30 2015 UTC,"Presumably you're not American or otherwise legal to work in the US - this is your biggest trouble.  You will need a work visa in order to live and work here, and while there are many options (TN and H-1B for the most part), all would require an employer to sponsor you, and all cost a fair bit of money in terms of legal fees for said employer.  For in-demand industries like finance or high-tech there is no shortage of companies willing to get the visa for you, for less contentious industries (like marketing and social media) the willingness is much less (which is my polite way of saying: nearly zero).  Which is also to say, there are some jobs/fields where, as a Canadian, you stand no chance of working legally in the United States. If you really want to live in NYC you will need to target a field that has a sever enough talent shortage that companies are willing to jump through the legal hoops to bring you in."

I'm working in a similar position and it doesn't pay a ton, nor there's a huge need because a company only needs 1 person to work their PR/social media stuff. It's not unrealistic, but if you're coming outside the country it might be harder to get a company to give you a visa. If you have a more in demand job, the easier it might be.  I'd also think about if you really want to move. It's your choice but nyc isn't really that never ending party. It's up to how you want to spend your time here.

AskNYC,3cahjy,parkerpyne,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:35:22 2015 UTC,"It's quite common that high end sushi places in England cater for vegetarians, same for Japan actually where sushi is at the pinnacle of authenticity. I just can't really find any information which is making me a bit reluctant because I don't want my boyfriend to have a bad time.    I dunno, I can get it here in various locations in my small English home town. I just assumed that a place as vast and diverse as New York with the crazy, niche little places there was bound to something. Maybe I'm over estimating but surely there has to be somewhere?  As you've already pointed out not all Sushi is fish; there are various styles, some of which only really have fish dishes yes, but not all sushi necessarily contains fish.    Kappa Maki, Inari Iso, Oboro Maki, Tamago to name a few off the top of my head.   Thanks for taking the time to respond though!"
AskNYC,3cahjy,prophetsavant,3,Mon Jul 6 12:59:52 2015 UTC,"You can get vegetarian sushi omakase at several places in a small town in England, or vegetarian ala carte sushi? All of the NYC places will have ala carte options. If you want to arrange vegetarian omakase you are going to have to get on the phone. If you can afford omakase at Yasuda, you can afford to make a phone call (which you are going to have to do for the reservation anyway)."
AskNYC,3cahjy,Miss_Misery24,-1,Mon Jul 6 13:36:19 2015 UTC,Ala carte I mean in the UK. Think I'm just going to have to bite the bullet and take a hit to find out!
AskNYC,3cahjy,vanityfairandco,3,Mon Jul 6 13:52:36 2015 UTC,"Tough call. The problem with omakase is that it's 'chef's choice', implying that he chooses the freshest fish available and vegetables don't fall into that category. Plus with tasting menus they tend to ask the whole table to participate for ease in the kitchen. I honestly think scrap the idea of omakase. I really like hasaki in the east village. Traditional Japanese, not too expensive and they will have vegetarian options.   If you do decide on nakazawa (and thus ditching your BF for one meal because it's really not vegetable friendly), I just made reservations for my husbands birthday and I had to set my alarm for midnight exactly one month before the date which in the UK would be 5am I think."
AskNYC,3cahjy,AnneFrankenstein,-2,Mon Jul 6 13:37:28 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend doesn't want Omakase, it's me that wants that. I just want to make sure he can eat something should I choose to eat Omakase. It is looking like I'm going to have to scrap the idea of eating Omakase, which sucks. But hey ho.   Have you heard of Tanoshi Sushi? Someone else has recommended this and by the sounds of it they may actually be able to do Vegetarian Omakase. Going to shoot them an email now."

AskNYC,3cahjy,drogean3,-5,Mon Jul 6 11:48:57 2015 UTC,Omakase is essentially like the Chef's selection where he has come up with a menu and prepares your sushi to your tastes; most of the places I find I can only find information on sushi with fish. But i'm sure he'd be overcome with enthusiasm if I tell him I'm going to be eating some crazy goooood sushi while he just has to sit there and eat a bowl of rice.

AskNYC,3c84gg,jamesking420,3,Sun Jul 5 20:07:59 2015 UTC,"AirBnb - we were considering this apartment. How's the location for touristy stuff/safety? https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/6249050[1]   Not bad, not as flashy as some other places, but doable since you're near a subway station. Looks like it's within walking distance of the Cloisters too, which is often absent from tourist radars because of the distance.   Any recommended restaurants?   Approximate budget?   Any recommended tourist things we may not think of?   What things are you already planning on visiting? What kinds of things interest you?   I'm a New Orleans Saints fan, considering going to Washington on the Sunday to watch us against the Redskins. Any recommendations on how to do this, transportation wise?   Amtrak is probably the easiest option. Tickets will be ~$50+/each, and the trip will take 4h each way. You can also look for cheap bus deals that can save you a lot of money, but the time spent driving down to DC will be a bit longer. Personally I would say that unless you're willing to spend at least a few days in DC, trying to fit in a day trip from NYC is probably not worth it. Boston and Philadelphia are more viable options, obviously without the football game.   My girlfriend has been briefly to NYC before - she has been up the Empire State Building. Where would you recommend as an alternative tower that she and I could go up, so that she's not repeating things.   The One WTC observation deck just opened a month ago (~$30), and is right next to the 9/11 memorial and museum. Rockefeller Center in midtown is the other option, where you can see the Empire State Building and Central Park from up high (~$25ish?). The view from the Top of the Rock will be more similar to that of the ESB, but both are still good options. Book a ticket online beforehand to skip some of the queues.   We're going to go to the 9/11 memorial. :( Do we need to book for that at all?   The memorial itself is outdoors and open to the public. The museum will require a ticket which can be bought on site, though again, it's better to buy online in advance to avoid waiting in line.    Do we need a weekly subway pass?   It's worth it if you plan on using the subway at least twice a day. An easy choice considering your location."
AskNYC,3c84gg,xindas,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:24:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I think we'll go for the one world observation deck. We will also get a subway pass and check out cloisters.   Thanks for the advice re: Washington. I think I'm going to abandon the plan to travel there and just try and find a Saints bar to watch the game.   Food budget, I'd assume around $40 per person in the UK - for a sit down meal, excluding drinks - but not sure how that would stack up in NYC. We'll certainly be checking out some of the recommended cheap places (prosperity dumpling and a pizza place or two)."
AskNYC,3c84gg,cantcountnoaccount,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:55:24 2015 UTC,"The subway card appears to work Tuesday to Tuesday (until midnight 7 days from first use)? We'll have a back pack each (nothing else), so is it realistic to use the subway from JFK to Washington Heights? Some comments elsewhere say not to use the subway from the airport..."
AskNYC,3c84gg,cantcountnoaccount,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:58:47 2015 UTC,"If you go the whole way on the subway it's a hella long trip. About 2-2.5 hours, maybe a bit longer.   If you want to shorten it up a bit, take the Airtrain to Jamaica station. Get on any LIRR (commuter rail) going to Penn Station. It's $10 if peak, $7.25 off off-peak (buy ticket from machine). At Penn you can get the 1 or the a/c/e which go to Washington Heights. Trip is a half-hour shorter compared to subway.  However, once you add up all your public transit fees: Airtrain $5 LIRR $10 subway $2.75 x2= $35... While cab from JFK is a flat fare of $52. So it's a LOT of hassle to save $17."

AskNYC,3c9ng5,moolamoney,9,Mon Jul 6 04:32:39 2015 UTC,Pay the ticket.
AskNYC,3c9ng5,sokpuppet1,4,Mon Jul 6 05:34:14 2015 UTC,"No, it is not. You are probably better off just sucking it up and paying the ticket. If you want to fight it, you could hire a traffic ticket attorney, but that is usually only worth it if you need to avoid the points on your license and don't mind paying extra for that."
AskNYC,3c9ng5,paratactical,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:48:50 2015 UTC,"I was hoping they would do something like a plea where you say you're guilty, but still show up in court to describe your circumstances or something."

Honestly, you were egregiously speeding. Suck it up and pay the ticket."
AskNYC,3c9ng5,pfthrowaway21315,2,Mon Jul 6 15:21:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you were egregiously speeding. Suck it up and pay the ticket.    While paying the ticket may be the best option for him, comments like this are not helpful. It isn't uncommon for speed limits to decrease out of nowhere, in order to create a speed trap.   I don't know the circumstances of this infraction, but people come to this forum for advice, not to be patronized."
AskNYC,3c9ng5,pfthrowaway21315,0,Mon Jul 6 17:53:58 2015 UTC,"1) Where exactly did you get the ticket? Some parts of NY handle their traffic tickets in what is called the TVB (Traffic Violations Bureau). This is essentially a kangaroo court which does not offer plea bargaining. Other times, tickets are handled in a town court which DOES offer plea bargaining.  2) You say you're going to have to go to court for it - why? I'm surprised that a 20mph speeding ticket requires a court appearance.  3) If the cop doesn't show, you do win. Problem is that most cops do show. You may get lucky, but don't count on it.  Long story short is that IF you have to go to court and your ticket is not handled by the TVB, you might as well plea bargain. However, if you do not have to go to court OR your ticket is handled by the TVB, you may be better off just paying the ticket.  I'm sorry this had to happen to you. NY cops are essentially just revenue enforcement agents, and they probably saw paydirt when they saw you speeding with your Canadian plates (as non-local drivers are less likely to contest tickets.)"
AskNYC,3c9ng5,pfthrowaway21315,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:23:55 2015 UTC,"It was in a very small town. I was driving through the backroads and the town was literally a 5 minute drive through. The speed changed from 50mph to 30mph and the cop was hiding right after the speed limit change. I honestly have no idea why I gotta go to court. He just handed me a piece of paper with a bunch of information about my speeding, his name, and the court information. Do you know where I would check to see if the place I got the ticket has TVB? I was pretty surprised too, as I've never gotten a ticket before."
AskNYC,3c9ng5,pfthrowaway21315,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:01:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, by the sound of it, it's probably handled by the town court. Many small towns are notorious for speed traps like this and town courts are good ways to keeping the revenue in town.  Questions:  1) How far away is the court from your home?  2) Do you have to appear in court?"
AskNYC,3c7veh,disapproving_narwhal,4,Sun Jul 5 18:47:54 2015 UTC,"The real estate market in NYC does move very fast, so it isn't unreasonable to find a place within five days. However, you are not going to be able to be picky. As much as they suck, you'll probably need to use a broker who can line up a bunch of apartments for you to see in one day and help move the process along. There's a ton more information about renting in NYC in the subreddit wiki.   Honestly, that's a really low budget if you want to be 20 minutes from NYU. You're not going to find anything near that price in Manhattan unless you're willing to room with other people."
