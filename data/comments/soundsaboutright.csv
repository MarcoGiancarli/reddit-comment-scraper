I am tired because the same type of person who can only talk about liberal issues can never talk about anything of importance.  I'm mad because I know that marijuana and homosexuality and just about everything else is bound to be legalized, that is already guaranteed to them. By the time that is said and done, the economy will be in tatters and we might even be headed off to war.  Maybe one day you will be pissed too, but it will be too late then. You will realize the wisdom in my words, that those sort of social issues were bound to become legalized anyways and it wasn't worth the time to talk about them, if you disagreed with them or not, it didn't really matter.

I have already been to the Philippines, even divorce between straight couples is illegal. I have a fiance there. They have one of the fastest growing economies in the world, and tons of American jobs are flowing over into their country, the American military will probably be back there soon enough, and it just feels exciting and full of life to me.  When people argue over North America, I feel like we're arguing over a corpse. The wage gap is bigger than it was during the great depression and all these idiots have to argue over is a ceremony that straight people in North America no longer value.   And they won't put away the axe they have to grind either, next it will be transgendered issues or whatever stupidity that ideally I would have never heard about in the first place.  Honestly to me, that all just seems like a cancer in the country, slowing killing it. It's not the sign of a normally functioning country. Over in Asia none of this crap is a concern, and they are only concerned about jobs, shelter, food, etc. As it should be. Over in North America people just argue about made up problems that don't even matter, meanwhile the problems that matter will never get attention. It's dead already, to me it's just a good place to live sometimes and earn money sometimes, but the people and the future of the place is of zero interest to me, they are all greedy and stupid and their own worse enemies. I'd rather go to a place where the people are actually trying to help themselves, to actually not starve and die of simple medical diseases. That is a fight that makes sense to me. That basically sums up my argument, I only have time for things that are simple and make sense. Jobs, the economy, living, etc."

Is the medic wasting his time by treating a non-fatal injury when so many are dying, or is he making the right decision for the situation by treating a patient who can return to the fight?

soundsaboutright,3b2cxk,jsh1138,5,Thu Jun 25 16:00:05 2015 UTC,"Depends.  Pools are horrible because of all the chemicals, and piss and other human refuse in such a relatively small body of water.  The ocean is not great (at least on the eastern shore of the US) because of all the bullshit floating around in there, but even if it weren't for people the salt water is terrible to accidentally ingest, but at least it's fun to swim around in the ocean. It would be great on a private beach or something I imagine. sand sucks too though.  Lakes are usually pretty nice because they're big enough to dilute stuff, and fairly low on chemicals (unless its poluted obviously)  Rivers can be really nice because the water is moving at all times so nothing just sits there and gets all stagnant. I personally like bays the best maybe tied with lakes. then small-medium rivers. pools are the worst, but I'm only speaking for public pools because I've only ever had an above ground pool when I was much younger.  I'd love to have a lazy river in my back yard. With a pond in the middle... damn the costs!"

Loaded is also highly evident in the fact that it brings these two figures together in the question, attempting to get the sample to cooperate in what it was trying to do; to say what it wanted them to say.   Depending how you word anything, you could get a significant portion of the population to agree that we've landed men on Pluto. All you have to do is tell them that our scientific instruments have Pluto in view (which is true) and we are going to be there in a couple of months. It's both leading and loaded when you fail to tell them key details about the scientific mission, and nor should you expect the general population to be well versed in highly specialized forms of knowledge such as space travel; or history for that matter... We are talking about things that happened 500 or 2000+ years ago. Most so called religious people have only a passing knowledge of their religious text and most people have an even worse knowledge of history in general.   It's not fair to assume that the general public will have a good knowledge of history, look at the garbage our system pumps out in the media.

The reality is that they would be better off sticking with the status quo. Russia is pretty absurd to think that they are protecting themselves by invading the Ukraine. If they need that much buffer room from Westernization then their culture is not worthy of standing by itself. China thinks it's able to steal everyone's ocean and keep all the oil under that without any significant negatives. The negatives are probably going to be so stacked against them that all the oil underneath it is not worth it for them.  tl;dr: Words like ""international law, sovereign state"" etc exist for a reason. Economically, the Ukraine crisis has not been worth it for Russia, not by a long shot. I don't think China's conquest will be worth it for them either.

soundsaboutright,37try5,Paladin_Mal,0,Sat May 30 09:18:13 2015 UTC,"There's some strangeness in those results. I don't think it's as simple as a correlation between ""conservative religion"" and anti-scientific bias. After all, they've lumped all Catholics and all Orthodox Christians together, and members of those groups can certainly be liberal or very conservative.  They might have been more honest had they classified religious groups as more or less associated with conservative politics, specifically in the American context. But then, they wouldn't be able to say anything (apparently) interesting or new on the topic. At most, what we might be seeing here is the degree to which various religious groups have become affiliated with one of the two great political tribes."

soundsaboutright,36g5ig,CocaineAndMojitos,1 point,Tue May 19 03:13:19 2015 UTC,"This article sounds rather inaccurate for a number of reasons. First off, it implies that high schools students in these schools don't use their cellphones throughout the day. Trust me, they do. Second, it's the student's fault for observing his/her phone instead of the teacher. This isn't really an issue with phones, as the article would make it seem, but rather an issue with today's student. Additionally, this study really doesn't show or account for any other factors in the high school that may be cultivated by the more conservative, restrictive high school culture."

INTERVIEWER: Judging from your contribution to the Season 5 “Game of Thrones” mixtape, it seems as though you’re a big fanboy.  SNOOP: Most definitely. When they asked me to do the track, I was more than honored because I’m truly a fan of the show. I would have done it for free, but they gave me some money on top of it, so I was like, “F - - k it, let’s do it!” I watch it for historic reasons, to try to understand what this world was based on before I got here. I like to know how we got from there, to here, and the similarities between then and now.   Game of Thrones is absolutely based on the systems of power and wealth that existed in medieval times, though, which I think Snoop was getting at.  I think this might be the worst headline I've ever come across.  Did you even read the article, OP?"

Probably the most encouraging thought.  4) We're just not that interesting: whether time travel is burdensome or whatever reason, a silly convention is not a point in time worth visiting.  5) Some logistical reason we can't comprehend: for whatever reason, reverse time travel is possible, but some aspect of it makes it impossible to visit us.

The article itself even says:   Of course, other factors could play into the development of a young adult’s drinking habits..   There are so many other factors linked to the opportunity to have a first sip that the first sip in itself is likely to be of low significance. For example a family who does not drink at all is unlikely to introduce their children to alcohol. I would suggest that being in a family that accesses alcohol is more likely to be a major factor rather than focusing on a single ""sip"".  Who pays for this poorly thought out research! It is like researching children under the age of 5 who caught a glimpse of a beer bottle, and trying to associate that with drinking later in life, totally useless information."
