My was clamp it to my desk, at the appropriate height, and attach elastic tie down straps to where to the cable would normally.  This gives me some adjustable resistance to work against.  The prosthetic, above elbow.... is going to be tricky. I can't yaw my arm sort of thing, so when you consider all the changes in angles and the effects of giving the joints to full a range of movement, whatever I make needs so thought.

The treatment process technically weakens the outer material by softening it, but the overall strength of the part increases due to the elimination of stress concentrations.   And from http://3dprintingsystems.com/using-acetone-to-strengthen-3d-printed-parts/ :   After some experimentation to find the ideal length of time to suspend the part in acetone vapour, the part when tested could now hold upwards of 85 kg! This resulted in the acetone part being 7x stronger than the printed part right off the printer.   The easiest way to understand this one is tearing open a bag of potato chips.

Just take a picture of whatever your print should fit to or put it on a flatbed scanner. Measure one length of your item as exact as you can. Then, import the picture into your 3D modeling tools and scale it according to your measurement.  Then, design your cap/cover/whatever to fit the picture.  I did this for a couple of tools on my workbench to make custom wall mounts, and it works pretty good."

Use a piece of string and place one end at the beginning and one at the end of the rounded part. Pull one vertical, one horizontal, their intersection is your radius. Assuming the rounded section is 90 degrees of a circle. Which is pretty typical IMO.    Second way... Is to use math...  Finding the length of an arc. Plenty of tutorials online. Still requires measurements."

Then measure from the edge to the end of the fillet, to determine the fillet radius, and apply that to your 3d model of the rectangle.  This only works for 90 degree bends.

functionalprint,3a87mo,ubermeisters,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:06:19 2015 UTC,"The manual way:  Apply masking tape to surface and place regularly spaced gridlines.    Use a profile gauge like this to extract the curves along those lines, and then bring the curve in (using a scanner and then CAD) to reconstruct the surface.  Keep in mind that designers usually like to use nice numbers when setting points for curves or specifying the curve radii.  So if something looks like (say) 0.127"" when you measure it.  It probably was 0.125"".  The less manual way: Spray paint the object with foot powder if glossy.  Then scan it with a 3D scanner like a Kinect or Sense; or a Matter & Form scanner; or even a NextEngine.  There are even higher-end tools -- articulated-arm CMM devices and whatnot.

functionalprint,366bop,RaleighSea,1 point,Sun May 17 01:59:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  The 6"" holders are two pieces each.  I'm using a FlashForge Dreamer, and the square around the collar is 164mm.  The Dreamer print bed has a depth of 150mm, so there was no way to print a single piece.    I haven't uploaded the 6"" collar to Thingiverse because it's not a great design -- there's little clearance between the edge of the collar and the actual hole for the pot, so the screw holes are a bit flimsy.  I might re-work the design, though, to print these as quarters, so I can make the ""ends"" of the arc a little wider.  That would give me more room to make some sort of alignment tabs on them, like I did on the USB collars.    I do all of my designs in OpenSCAD, btw, and happy to share those files, too.  I have one more print for this habitat; one of my grow lights was missing the mounting brackets when it arrived, so I created some that slot in correctly to the grow light housing."

functionalprint,35ojj0,SKapper,4,Tue May 12 05:50:32 2015 UTC,"Awesome job! Just wondering, with a taller stick design, you are trading mobility for strength required in shifting. Is it mostly strength that is lacking and you're able to move larger distances easily?  Also, it's a bit hard to tell, but is the ""wrist"" linkage component a complete pivotal link or just side-to-side? Maybe a video of you using it might make it easier to understand how it works mechanically."
functionalprint,35ojj0,kwaaaaaaaaa,9,Tue May 12 08:29:52 2015 UTC,"I think you're right - a video would help.  Leave it with me, I'll drop a link when I have one.  As for wrists and elbows, they're both rod ends - with about 14 degrees of freedom.  The reason there is a middle man/part between the stick and the wrist end was originally so I could try different heights.  Turns out I feel more height is needed.  The next ""stick"" is printing now and it's about 70mm taller, which should produce a near 90 degree angle at the elbow.  This will require a greater range of movement at my shoulder, but increasing the height is essentially increasing the length of the lever - reducing the amount of required effort... right?  The injury - that lead to the amputation - is a brachial plexus injury.  Essentially the bulk of the nerves to my arm were ripped out of my spine.  I have a lot of strength in the ""push"" direction, very little in the ""pull"" direction and pretty much zero strength in the ""swing"" direction.  Shifting up in my car is ""push"", shifting down is ""pull"".  As it is I had to get custom springs made for the shifter mechanism in the car so I could shift down.  A little extra leverage might help again.  My physio tells me with effort I could get enough strength to pull off shifting gears in a manual transmission.  But it'll require both a shit tonne of exercise and an ""arm"" that utilised the available strength efficiently.  I'm thinking I should just get a sequential gearbox... but that might cost an arm AND a leg."

The lifespan of the live joints seems to be very sensitive to small changes in the thickness and curvature radius of the joint.

It was used that way by the Roman poet Horace and later by Statius. The allusion then was to a friend so dear that he/she was more than half of a person's being. That meaning persists, although these days, if the term is used seriously rather than sarcastically, it is generally considered to mean 'the superior half of a married couple'. That is, better in quality rather than in quantity.  Sir Philip Sidney was the first to put into print the use of this phrase to mean spouse, in The Countesse of Pembrokes Arcadia, 1580:  ""My deare, my better halfe (sayd hee) I find I must now leaue thee.""

Using estimates and trial and error I created a 3D printed part to prop the splash guard partially open so that it doesn't make contact with the still forming ice. This helps most of the water running down the splash guard to drain safely into the water reservoir instead being pulled around and onto the ice below.  This took about two hours from start to finish, most of which was print time (around 20 minutes per attempt).  The part was printed on a Printrbot Simple Metal using PLA on an (upgraded) heated bed.

While t-glase meets this requirement, it results in a low glass transition temperature.

functionalprint,2y3hda,Verusauxilium,2,Fri Mar 6 02:47:04 2015 UTC,"While I enjoy your design aspect, I've  compared a few fan shrouds and can state other designs that may be better, if you're looking at upgrades. I would say that this is a step up to the previous design without a doubt (please put it on thingiverse :) ).  Issues I can see happening with the current shroud:    Air cools one side of print more. I've seen this happen with NinjaFlex and getting more detail on one side.  Tip can cool/vary in temp. A lot of this has to do with the PID loop and can generally be compensated for. Printer bots likely have a low P value, so I'm not sure.    So there are designs by printrbot (on their metal plus) and on hyrels to get around each problem.  On the printrbot metal plus's, they actually essentially have several tubes flow air in a circle about 250 degrees around the nozzle, more pointed down then sideways. On prints without a heated bed on materials that lift, you have to tell it not to use the fans several layers up as the air downward increases the cooling of the entire device.  On Hyrel, they released an upgrade which actually had a split right in the middle. This would prevent air from blowing as much on the nozzle itself. Their old model would take forever to heat up (manually had to turn on/off fan, would read slic3r settings), they had a strong blower motor for the fan. This probably isn't necessary on a printrbot though. I'm not sure of the CFMs, but I'd say the blower motor is likely much larger. You're fan upgrade looks like a contender though! This also might help with layer adhesion by keeping the filament up to temp at the interface, but I'd assume bridging may be effected a bit. Tests are needed, but you could always easily add it to your design and test! Maybe as just a little add on to your current design so you don't have to take off/on for tests!"

functionalprint,2xhku9,wingnut0420,2,Sat Feb 28 19:40:06 2015 UTC,"Serious question. Does the extra overall width that these add to the bike cause you any concerns in traffic?   I have something similar for my pushbike, but the mirrors fold away if needed into the bar-ends, and pretty much the only time I have the mirrors deployed is when I'm away from people on the open road."
functionalprint,2xhku9,evil-frank,3,Sun Mar 1 01:13:58 2015 UTC,While lane splitting it's definitely something to watch out for.  The stock mirrors were places in such a way that they were perfect for whacking peoples mirrors.  These make the bike wider but I get about the same clearance between cars.  I typically won't filter if traffic is that tight.  Also they're adjustable so I'm going to play with different positions to see which is optimal.

functionalprint,2wskq6,traverseda,1 point,Tue Feb 24 02:18:46 2015 UTC,"In sketchup, I have found that if you select the model, and use the soften edges tool - slide it to 80 or 100 and back to about 30%. Edges around holes and usually double faces won't soften. Making faces translucent will also help you identify places where you might have two layers. And be sure to right click and ""reverse faces"" whenever you have a gray plane facing out.   I'm sure there are some other little tricks I use regularly, but that's all I can think of right off the top of my head. I guess you know to always delete all internal structures."

It will clear out the faces inside your structure, and I like their yellow/red view over the white/grey.  The red really stands out and helps you find all of the hidden areas with open gaps to the inside of the structure.  This extension alone may be why I am confused with the Sketchup hate for 3d printing, because without it, this would be much, much harder.  Edit: sorry, I misspoke.  While the Solid Inspector is invaluable, it is actually the Cadspan tools extension that helps with the coloring and the stl export."

I'm imagining something like a cylinder with a hole in the middle for a bolt of the right length and a hex cavity on one side to hold the bolt in place.  Perhaps a mating part for the hex cavity that can accept the dowel from the wheels to fit everything together.  The other measurements needed are dowel diameter, insert length (how much of the dowel goes in) and total dowel length. Overall diameter of the insert would be good too so it doesn't bind on the wheels nor legs. From there it's picking the closest bolt & building the cylinder & cap around it.  Design aside, I'd be hesitant to do this in anything other than 100% infill for real use as this seems like something ideal for a lathe & a drill press (and your choice of metals) but a bit dodgy for 3D printing."

Its interesting to keep in mind that SLA probably wouldn't be around today if we scraped the patent system back then and from what I know of Scott Crump, the same could be said about FDM.  I too have my concerns about intellectual property but the whole 3d printing industry, including the RepRap project was built upon those first few inventions that were pursued entirely for greed. That's not something that should be thrown away just because dodgy patents are sometimes granted."

If there were no patent system there would be far less people with far less incentive to pursue the initial stages once it did come around.

He challenges the audience to come up with so many billions worth value yet ignores the fact that the companies who do lodge patents make billions and trillions of dollars. Where is the logic in claiming they're all big corporate cronies while then claiming they don't make any money? Making shit tons of money is what these companies do even if you think they're evil incarnate!  I'd also like to point out that his libertarian American rhetoric is widely unpopular outside the US. For example he argues for that anti-bribery laws should be abolished and that unmitigated capitalism should reign supreme. That is an extremely controversial foundation for his arguments and aside from the US, that ideology doesn't have even marginal appeal anywhere else in the world.

functionalprint,2vultz,Hazy_V,2,Sat Feb 14 13:07:57 2015 UTC,"If it the base was tall enough for a fan to be added to the print would it increase the cooling effect?   That's an interesting idea, but the base of the PS2 slim is so narrow that placing an external fan would be a bit challenging. The slim's base is less than 27mm wide, and the bottom vent is only 9.2mm wide! I think a fan would have to be side-mounted, probably in between the legs. You might be able to avoid raising the console too much by having the fan off the the side slightly, with a duct to funnel air down under the PS2.  The PS2 slim does have an internal fan, so my hope is that as long as there's enough space for air to get into the intakes, and out the rear output, it'll be happy. Many of the stands I've seen completely cover the bottom set of intakes, but mine has the vent channel to the front grille. I also intentionally had the grille on the front rather than the back to stay away from the hot-air output, though that might be overkill, since the hot air should rise away from the intake.  Having said that, maybe it would make sense to add an additional grille in the back. That should be possible with very minor changes to the model, but might help improve airflow.   Nice design/print! I usually have to print like 5 before I get something that fits haha.   Thanks! Yeah, this actually didn't fit on my first attempt. I started the print in the evening, and just as I was going to bed I remember thinking ""crap, I should have double checked that front-to-rear measurement"". The next day, after it didn't fit, I double-checked with calipers, and sure enough my measurement was about 1mm off. Part of the beauty of 3D printing is that I can just reprint with the correction without losing too much work."

functionalprint,2vftzm,eainmonster,11,Tue Feb 10 19:46:28 2015 UTC,"I think because the cost benefit analysis works out better for a plastic injected mold.  I'm not in the industry, I'm just guessing on this.  But I imagine the plastic injected mold will create a more consistent and unified product in the end for whenever you mass produce something.  Furthermore, a lot of the mold automation already exists for this mass printing factor.    That said, casting the mold for your product is expensive.  So, being able to print a prototype on a 3d printer and dialing the design into perfection before you have to cast it has to be an amazing godsend.  So, here you have a printer that can make any part that a maker (who probably does a lot of one-off unique items), and a designer (for his product prototypes) can develop and refine at lower cost before having a mold cast.    Then, they now even have a middle layer.  At IMTS I saw a machine that would 3d-print a mold so you could cast parts from the 3d printed mold.  So, it would act as a middle layer between 3d printing and injection molding.  tl;dr non-specialist gives his opinion.  Other paths are cheaper for mass production."
functionalprint,2vftzm,DragonOChaos,2,Tue Feb 10 18:17:11 2015 UTC,Also the time it takes to injection mold one part vs to 3d print it. You're looking at a much larger investment to be able to match production.

The only reason it's now popular among makers is that it's reasonably affordable to do so.  The place where I intern has had a 3D printer for  at least ten years.    The root of it is this:  Use the right tool for the job.  Are you making custom on-off parts?  Use a 3D printer/SLS/FDM system.  Do you need to make 500-50,000 of a part, and need to do it in a reasonable time with consistent results?  It's going to be a lot cheaper to have an injection mold made.  Are you designing a device and need to make quick changes from one iteration to the next?  3D print it.  3D printing has caught on, and is being used a lot by entities that see a use for it."

functionalprint,2vftzm,mrhelton,3,Wed Feb 11 07:47:26 2015 UTC,3d printing is only time/cost effective for prototypes or very small runs of parts. Once you get into larger runs of parts the time it takes to print the part becomes an issue. A part that takes an hour to print can be injection molded in seconds. The other thing to think of is the strength.

Yes, completely on board that a part that you are going to sell in mass is going to have to be molded, etc.  What I am talking about is low run, say 100 or less of a part where function trumps finish.    I do design and manufacture for a living.  So here is the scenario:  Hospital needed a part to go on a COW to hold a printer.  They only needed 9.  To machine out of AL would have been close to $60 a part.  Sheet metal would have been around $35 to $40.  Injection molding or thermoforming was out the question because of tooling costs.  We presented a 3D printed solution for around $18 and there was push back because it was 3D printed citing that they thought that was how we were going to test it to make sure it worked.  We told them no, it is the most cost effective solution in this instance.    We ended up printing them one and were able to sell it to them, but my contention is that it is still not seen as a viable way to produce finished parts when the mode of manufacturing lends itself to that.  People still think that is is only for prototyping."

functionalprint,2vftzm,EquipLordBritish,1 point,Wed Feb 11 12:17:46 2015 UTC,"A fellow design and manufacturing dude! Hello and I'm right with you on the value of 3D printing. A lot of people have offered suggested answers but I think almost all of it is speculation coming from the wrong point of view. In fact I think pretty much all people both on reddit and elsewhere suffer from a sadly too-narrow view of 3D printing because of entrenched thinking.  A 3D printer is a tool unlike any tool humans have had before. I used to do design and manufacturing at a CNC shop, so I'm intimately familiar with how much labor is involved in modern manufacturing. Even on ""automatic"" CNC machines, considerable resources (tools, labor, materials) are required to make individual parts. They do it beautifully but it takes an $85k/yr programmer/operator to utilize those tools.  People see 3D printing as another tool in the same family as tools in a machine shop or factory. But 3D printers produce their parts with zero skilled labor required. This is fundamentally different from existing manufacturing techniques and it's as significant a change to manufacturing as digital cameras were to photography.  Unfortunately, most people are unfamiliar with the complexities of traditional manufacturing so they have a hard time seeing what is new. Additionally I don't think many people specialize in the study of how inventions change the world. But watch James Burke's Connections and you'll start to see how very large changes come from seemingly pedestrian advances in technology.  3D printing, I think, it a sleeping giant of a technology that few people understand. I learned a lot about design for manufacturing since I had to machine the parts I designed. For me it was second nature to experiment with my printer and find it's strengths and weaknesses, and then design parts that work well for printing.  I think many people think all manufacturing is approximately the same. I've heard endless stories of engineers designing a part for machining and then trying to get that exact design made by injection molding, but of course the process doesn't work that way.  3D printing has its own quirks, but when you design parts with the process in mind it's extremely powerful. I design printed robots that use almost no non-printed parts. I don't even use screws - things just interlock and snap together.  The fact that printed parts require no skilled labor to acquire means they can be freely shared online unlike physical goods that require a factory. You can also continually iterate, making a ""rough draft"" of a part, printing it to see what general concepts work and what don't, and hen refine it as necessary. The ability to iterate, share and reproduce designs for pennies, and iterate continuously means 3D printing is ideal for open source designs. We've seen this work well for 3D printers themselves, but my hope is that we can form a community to produce more valuable open hardware designs.  I've been developing a basic methodology for designing complex useful things like robots in a printable open source way, and have a good design now for a printable remote control car with no screws and literally the minimum possible printed parts (8 608's, battery/electronics, motor, servo, and tires or o-rings). I want to share this design and some videos to encourage people to take the design farther.  One major issue on people seeing the value is that crowd-sourced designs may be the most powerful theoretically but crowd-accessible cad is extremely limited. OpenSCAD is great but nothing beats solidworks. I'm hoping that VR CAD applications may reset the market and introduce some new players in that space, because we need something more open than accessible.  But basically I think we don't see it taking off more quickly because people don't understand radical new things. The issue isn't the speed, since ""a handful of useful parts in a day"" is much better than even parts sitting in an amazon warehouse and the digital nature is a significant improvement. Compelling example projects can help with this."

I am in complete agreement with everything that you say here and yes I am a fellow design and manufacturing dude for sure.  Been working in the industry for more than 15 years and I see so much potential for 3D printing.  You are correct, nothing beats Solidworks for sure, unless of course you are talking about another equally powerful software like UG or Katia or Inventor.

If you need more than 10 of the thing, printing it is probably the wrong answer.

And if you're using something as cheap as plastic, you want to either sell it with a high profit margin (unlikely, due to everyone knowing it's made of cheap plastic), or sell it in large quantities to make it profitable.  I suppose that even with large volumes in the long run, it would make sense to have something that can switch to making vastly different products just by loading a new flash drive, but by the time that becomes a problem better printing technology will be available, and it isn't likely to be finantially useful to switch now."

But, if you want to get 10 of something (like the drill holders I saw on here or something) 3d printing is way ahead of any method. Also, nothing can touch 3d printing some tooling jobs as far as cost goes. Instead of generating the bracket or what have you in Alum, you can easily just print it. Its not that its not gaining traction, its just like any other method of doing anything, it has its place in the manufacturing world.

Because instead of printing in one location and physically delivering printed paper, most places distribute digitally and have customers who need the physical document print themselves. Cheap printers meant no one, not even the distributors needed to print 10,000 pages.  $600 printers won't replace commercial machines at a commercial location (well actually in many cases they are), but instead $600 printers will mean ""manufacturers"" won't need to physically produce parts themselves anymore, and can focus on what they are actually adding to the market - design."

functionalprint,2vftzm,Staticbox,3,Wed Feb 11 05:03:44 2015 UTC,"Injection molding is a couple hundred times slower and 1,000 more expensive if you only need one part.  Injection molding and 3D printing are not tools for the same job."
functionalprint,2vftzm,hellokitty,1 point,Wed Feb 11 08:17:56 2015 UTC,Commercially however I would say at least 90 percent of jobs are done more than once.
functionalprint,2vftzm,dtmbcorp,1 point,Wed Feb 11 12:57:05 2015 UTC,"Sure, because they have to. You can't make parts economically with injection molding if you only need a few units. They make a lot of parts to recover the cost of the mold. So they make maybe 10,000 of something. But do they really want 10,000? They have to store the parts somewhere. And what if they want to change the design after they've used only 1000 pcs? Do they sell outdated goods or scrap the box of parts they have?  Things are done a certain way now because that's what are tools have been good for, not necessarily because it is an ideal way to make something. Companies build their businesses around these limitations, but what if they didn't have to?  When you look at the potential for a new technology don't try to fit it into existing methods of doing things. Look at how the methods might change to better accomplish our goals. 3D printing can mean local manufacturing (better quality control and cheaper shipping), just in time manufacturing (no warehouses full of parts waiting for customers), and a fluid design process that accepts changes to production parts at any time.  One of my friends owns a 3D printer company and they have a bot farm that just produces sample parts endlessly. They also do contract work and says they can compete on price with injection molding for up to 10,000 pieces.  In areas like robotics where function, price, and design flexibility may be more valuable than aesthetics, 3D printing could legitimately be an ideal manufacturing method. Especially since volumes on robotics will tend to be low because of the specialized nature of most robots."
functionalprint,2vftzm,hellokitty,1 point,Thu Feb 12 01:32:13 2015 UTC,"I get what people are saying here and I have been in the industry for many moons and understand the differences between modes of manufacturing.  I understand the challenges of trying to do a large volume on a 3D printer.   My question, that I tried to relay, is that 3D printing has a stigma that it is really only for prototyping or the father from ""Honey I shrunk the kids"".    I do not see it like that and see it completely viable if the requirements (strength, finish, run size) are suited to that of 3d printing. I described such a real life example where selling the 3d printed parts where a hard sell at first because it was a 3d printed part."
functionalprint,2veei3,leethegeek,2,Tue Feb 10 08:29:12 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up: the softness of a light has very little to do with the thickness of the diffusion material and EVERYTHING to do with the SIZE of the source from the perspective of the subject.  It's not really the density of the material that the light is going through that softens a light.  The denser the diffusion material, the more EVEN the face of the source will appear to the subject, but it will still look like a hard light and the diffuser will only decrease the amount of light your flash puts out.    I'm sure the light is totally more even through your diffuser, but this print could be better if you actually significantly increased the size of the face of the original flash (as many after-market diffusers do).    It goes back to the physics of lighting.  The bigger the light source appears from the subject's perspective, the softer the light will be.  This is why a 20'x20' light is softer than a 1""x1"" light because light is coming from multiple angles (and filling its self in).  Some angles are shadowed by the nose but the face of the light is so big in the subject's view that it fills in its own shadows.   Here is an excellent video that lays out some lighting rules.  Rule #3 is the one that I am referring to and the reason why your diffuser doesn't really soften the light as much as you may have intended."
functionalprint,2veei3,demesisx,2,Tue Feb 10 18:29:58 2015 UTC,"Yep I completely agree, however to make an easily printable clip on that is larger (wider) is going to take some more design work and will probably require support material to print or need to be printed in 2 pieces and glued together. I am going to try to do it however. This version does what I wanted though, it softens the flash enough that it is not glaringly obvious a flash was used."
functionalprint,2veei3,demesisx,1 point,Tue Feb 10 19:02:38 2015 UTC,Yeah.  The best thing about a light that is close to the axis of the lens is that the shadows fall where the camera can't see.  That's why fill light is often as close to the lens axis as possible in order to put those hard shadows where they aren't seen.

It was very easy to design so using the basic idea you should be able to modify it to fit. I did it with designspark mechanical (free and awesome), I'll give you the project file if you like, maybe you can tweak it to work. On thingiverse there is 2 pictures of Odie one with and one without, you can see the flash is much more smoothed with it, there is still a shadow from the flash but the overall lighting is more even."

My next experiment is using Ninjaflex to make one-off O-rings, and pressure checking them and testing for deterioration.

functionalprint,2rexut,cfinke,7,Mon Jan 5 16:54:30 2015 UTC,"This looks like a lesson in the importance of fillets. Your first fix to the clip was to wisely add a fillet between the base and the clip to avoid those stress points. Similarly, you could add a fillet on the bottom of the clip base so that it distributes the load over the wheel's surface more evenly, and hopefully give it the rigidity it needs to pop the clips into place.  I imagine you modeled the thickness of the clips after the original design, but you're working with a different material and therefore you'll have to change the parameters of the snap hook (which can be done with trial and error). E.g., check out this BASF document on snap hooks: http://web.mit.edu/2.75/resources/random/Snap-Fit%20Design%20Manual.pdf. There are considerations for material, lever length, thickness, and depth, desired mating force, etc. that all impact one another.  This is where something like Solidworks comes in handy over OpenSCAD, as it makes it dead simple to add filets, and there's even a wizard for creating snap hooks.  You could also increase the rigidity of the wheel surface by adding corrugations, just as you would for a big sheet of steel that you wanted to keep rigid."

functionalprint,2rexut,tlalexander,4,Mon Jan 5 18:32:14 2015 UTC,"Have you thought about making the wheel two pieces that glue together? Then the clip could be printed laying down. Or was that what you did the second time?  You could repeatedly prototype the clip only as it would be a small print, and then print a wheel with a rectangular hole to glue the clip into. And since you're using ABS, all you need is acetone to glue the parts together."
functionalprint,2rexut,tlalexander,1 point,Mon Jan 5 20:31:12 2015 UTC,"If I was going to keep trying, my next step was to print the clip laying down like you said, so that the layers would be vertical when the clip is in place.

If you don't want to chance Chinese stuff, you can buy a regular qi charger and just pull it apart to get the coil out. I've seen a lot of people do it this way.

functionalprint,2nmsof,Hendo52,3,Fri Nov 28 12:30:26 2014 UTC,"very cool.  This is a turbine powered tool.  Some potential variations: design the turbine to fit a 2l bottle lid. Make a connector that will fill compressed air through the turbine into the bottle. Design the turbine cap to lock and close the bottle when pressed down.  The on button then is simply unlocking the valve/cap/turbine as it powers up.  This provides portable cordless power for any rotary motor.  120 psi is often used for water rockets.  Its also fairly easy to chain 2l bottles or otherwise feed pressurized air from the bottom though might need fancier valves for control, but the 2l bottle connector is ultra reusable and serves proof of concept machines well."

Why did you go with the more expensive serial LCD instead of a normal one?  Nice project never the less. Maybe worth adding a few Buttons to change the temperature?
functionalprint,2lzo9h,B0rax,6,Tue Nov 11 23:42:16 2014 UTC,"The unit ran on batteries for testing and prototyping. Once I got it permenantly mounted I used two extra wires that weren't connected to anything to run 6V DC to the arduino from the furnace room.  The serial LCD I used cost around $13.50 from Amazon. I like it because it can display a bunch more information than normal thermostats usually can. A regular LCD would have used many more pins and the cost of the serial unit seemed cheep enough to warrent the upgrade.   I might add buttons, but so far using the serial connection is working well for the odd times I need to change anything. The thermostat will have a network interface soon enough, so it will be really easy to change any setting using any computer on the network."

Anything ""bassy"" is non-existent, but I have a sub hooked up for that. These are version '0.1', but are surprisingly good give that they are transducers mounted to gatorboard."
functionalprint,2kl5w8,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Oct 30 01:48:19 2014 UTC,"I don't really have a good way of recording them right now. I will look around for my mic and maybe do a recording this weekend. They perform well in the high and mid range, but poorly in the low end. The bass is limited by the physical size of the board; as the frequency gets lower, waves get longer, and waves longer than the board will cancel out when the front and back waveforms interfere destructively."

functionalprint,2kl5w8,The__RIAA,1 point,Thu Oct 30 02:04:44 2014 UTC,"Yes they are transducers. Specifically these. I have 2 on each board. I use them mostly for YouTube videos and occasionally music or TV shows. I don't do a lot of media consumption at my desk (I have  60"" hometheater in the next room), but if I'm just goofing off in SolidWorks or monitoring a print I will put on Netflix or Spotify. Most of my music doesn't have a lot of bass, so I don't really notice the lack of low end. They handle human voices very well so I don't mind watching TV on them. Compared to my tiny laptop speakers they are a huge improvement."

functionalprint,2jzasw,pablothe,1 point,Wed Oct 22 15:08:03 2014 UTC,"On the front the torque is minimal, notice that the centre of mass is practically in the same line of action with the normal force.  On the sides, is almost the same scenario than before. The centre of mass is close to the ground, so a little move on the sides makes a little angle on the base. The sin of that angle times the distance depends exclusively on that distance. So as the centre of mass is close to the ground, that distance is short and therefore the torque is minimal. That would be totally different if the centre of mass was in a considerable height."
functionalprint,2jzasw,glider_integral,1 point,Wed Oct 22 16:09:29 2014 UTC,Yes I agree with that but since the bottle extends diagonally I'm afraid I could bump it more easily
functionalprint,2jzasw,Wetmelon,1 point,Wed Oct 22 17:23:42 2014 UTC,"Oh, yeah!  If it was horizontally the centre of mass would be lower thus making it more stable on the sides.  Now, if it the bottle was diagonally but downwards and changing the shape of the object, etc; the centre of mass would be even lower.  But then again it's all a game with several variables, maybe that little distance gained by being diagonally makes it more easy to bump. Maybe it's insignificant, I would go with it's insignificant, but to be sure we'd need a banana for scale."
functionalprint,2jzasw,glider_integral,2,Wed Oct 22 17:33:08 2014 UTC,You're talking about a factor of ~ 1/2 (by eye) if you put the bottle angled down vs up.  Of course I'd have to calculate the centroid of the block & the wine bottle to do this right ;)
functionalprint,2jzasw,LaboratoryOne,2,Wed Oct 22 18:43:02 2014 UTC,"Don't think the barycentre will help since the densities are totally different.

Without the banana for scale it's virtually a fermi problem."

functionalprint,2gmob7,oknowton,2,Wed Sep 17 04:01:09 2014 UTC,"This was one of my first functional prints, and I wrote about it before I discovered r/functionalprint.  I saw my ""12 dollar Bluetooth keyboard"" on a shelf at Fry's last night for $35, and that reminded me that I hadn't posted it here yet.  These are simple clips that attach to the back of a small wireless keyboard.  The have little grooves in the top where you can rest your tablet or cell phone.  The notches on top are sized pretty specifically for my LG  G Pad 8.3 inch tablet and its very narrow bezel, but they're also just big enough to fit my Nexus 4 phone in a pinch.  I don't use this setup very often.  It works quite well on a desk or table.  I've used it on my lap in a doctor's waiting room once, and I wrote about 500 blog words while I was there, but it isn't nearly as comfortable on my lap as a proper laptop.  You have to make sure that both clips hit your legs, so you can't move around very much.    If I ever revisit this project, I'll find a way to connect the clips across the back.  I figure that even leaving a hole for a pencil or something would work well enough.  I made this model in Blender before I discovered just how awesome OpenSCAD is.  That's another thing I'll correct if I ever need to print another set.  An OpenSCAD model would be much easier to customize for different size tablets, iPads, and phones."

Each pair lets the AC adapter sort of hang off the back of the monitor arms, and they have the correct fittings on top to secure the speaker.  One bracket has a hole for an M3 screw to fit the speaker's top keyhole slot, while the other bracket has a cube shape to fit slot at the bottom of the speaker (this was not the intended use for this slot, I'm sure).  Two sets of these brackets are letting me hide a speaker behind each monitor, and they're keeping my AC power bricks hidden away.  I also included my heavy 140-gram failed print.  Besides being huge, a waste of plastic, and completely the wrong size, it also printed very poorly.  It is printed in ABS (I can't print PLA well with my all metal hot end), and layers were separating all over the place.  The final design isn't perfect.  The two brackets are far enough apart that the AC adapter is just barely supported on each end.  I should have printed wider brackets, but I was lazy and would have had to invert the print for the opposite side.  It is functional enough, though, and the wire management ends up keeping the AC bricks from moving out of place and falling down."

I think it will either be DMX or ethernet cabled. Not sure just yet. The 3D parts will be the small mounts for the LED's but I have to watch for heat. We will see.   I also thought about printing the disco ball with the bulbs in them. It's a 1980's style light, similar to this saucer, but it's a disco ball with about 8 large bulb pin-spots in it."

Why not use a modeling tool that is just as easy to learn but works for 3D printing without the figgterdy jigging? That's Tinkercad. Or 123D Design. Or Meshmixer. Or LeoPoly.   Personally, I prefer Blender's toolset. Despite being a little harder to wrap your head around it's just so much more expansive and powerful that just about anything out there. Want to vertex edit? Done. Want to boolean objects together? Yup. Want to sculpt? Easy. Want do make something with precise dimensions? It's there.  There is literally nothing Sketchup does that makes it worth the trouble of putting up it when it comes to 3D printing. And with so many other options why would you waste your time with Sketchup?"

I disagree. Sketchup is very easy for newbies to pickup on, and as long as you follow the basic rules laid out in the article linked to above, you'll be well on your way to 3D printing.  I agree with your recommendation of starting with TinkerCad, but when you need more power without the mindboggling complex Blender UI, Sketchup is the way to go. Sketchup is NOT good for super curvy models or sculpting"

I think we're going to have to agree to disagree on this one but I will say this one last thing. In my opinion if start with Tinkercad by the time you outgrow it's quite frankly impressive tool set, Sketchup is not a step up. And definitely not for the cost of the hoops you have to jump through to make it work for 3D printing. Once you have the pros and the cons summed together Sketchup just doesn't peek above ""worth it"" to me in any scenario."

Just like Blender and other software have rules to follow for making solid and manifold models, these are the rules for Sketchup.  From my experience, most folks that knock Sketchup have not taken the time to learn how to properly use Sketchup, but those that do learn have made some amazing models."

I've worked for an animation company where we pumped out real time 3D models at ~30k triangles, with 4k textures starting off with a 3D scan decent enough to pick up thin stitching.  Scanning was a streamlined process.  Retopologising was done by entry level (cheap) employees and took ~4 hours.  Instead of using the scans as a primary source for our objects we'd use them where size was an issue or detail needed to be imprinted. In our case we projected from the scan to a normal map, but it would be very easy to project to a displacement map, which you'd then use to add minute details where the source object is too complex to waste time replicating.  We'd knock out high res 3D models in a day ... a rather unheard of feat.    Now onto practical applications; since this is what the subreddit is about:  Let's say you're working for a real estate firm producing little scale models of their housing development for marketing purposes. Send a drone up before construction starts with dual goPros or a micro PC & an ASUS xtion. Scan the terrain in lines from whatever range works and piece it together with a script. Then take some generic 3D models of houses, intersect them with the terrain and apply a join operation of some kind in your favourite 3D application (Boolean in 3Ds MAX). Run an STL check, clean up your holes, give the whole model a shell (thickness) and then print.  That's if you want to make lots of money ;)"

functionalprint,208q71,ShadowRam,3,Wed Mar 12 20:21:29 2014 UTC,"the point of the sub-reddit is to show useful prints,  Figurines, Vases, and similar stuff of which it's only purpose is to sit on a shelf and collect dust,   These objects are usually referred to as Dust Collectors  This post of course being a useful and functional actual dust collector is of course approved!"
functionalprint,208q71,toybuilder,2,Wed Mar 12 20:31:22 2014 UTC,LOL awesome.

functionalprint,2097dp,ShadowRam,1 point,Wed Mar 12 19:56:50 2014 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing, grip a clump of playdough in a comfortable position, then use a 3D scanner, maybe a Kinect to get a accurate 3D scan to print with the cavity and mount for the optical mouse circuit. You could even print with HDPE and make the slick pads under the mouse."

functionalprint,1yeanf,atomkemp,2,Thu Feb 20 01:04:01 2014 UTC,I request was made on /r/3Dprinting that I post a link to this model after I used it as an example useful things you can print at home. Enjoy!

functionalprint,1xzztp,Barthemieus,2,Wed Mar 12 15:13:32 2014 UTC,"My mom eats green onions all the time and buys them all the time at the store, but if they're easy to grow it would be cool to have one of these to grow them fresh.   Would you recommend PLA or ABS? I don't think ABS is food-safe."
functionalprint,1xzztp,themitch22,1 point,Wed Mar 12 19:27:59 2014 UTC,"It isn't the type of plastic (ABS is definitely food-safe), but the shape. The tiny textures created FDM printing are a breeding ground for yucky things."
functionalprint,1xzztp,hellphish,1 point,Mon Mar 17 23:13:39 2014 UTC,Use a plastic sheet as a liner. Or design with liner in mind.

functionalprint,1wy13p,ShadowRam,2,Tue Feb 4 01:22:31 2014 UTC,Aren't you worried the heated bed will warp the clips?  I use binder clips for mine. Although I do have a printed spacer thing to trick the z-limit switch into leaving room for the glass.
functionalprint,1wy13p,randrews,1 point,Tue Feb 4 05:39:39 2014 UTC,"Not currently no.  I'm using PLA only at the moment, so my Bed Temperature doesn't exceed 40deg C.  But now that I have the printer working reliably, the next step is to increase my bed size before moving on to ABS.  Since my new bed size will be a large piece of aluminum as a heat spreader and a thicker piece of glass, I'll need new clamps at that time anyway.  So you are right, I won't be able to use these when I increase by bed temperature for ABS use."
functionalprint,1wy13p,randrews,1 point,Tue Feb 4 16:03:39 2014 UTC,"See, I was thinking, the whole point of a heated bed is that it gets hot enough to make the plastic mushy, right? So whatever bed temperature you're using for PLA must be hot enough to make printed clips mushy. Unless you're using ABS printed clips on a heated-for-PLA bed, I guess."
functionalprint,1wy13p,randrews,1 point,Tue Feb 4 16:50:14 2014 UTC,"That's a good point,  These seem to be working for me.  It was kind of a quick replacement for folder clips for the short term.  The issue I had was this nozzle fan I designed,  Photo 1  Photo 2  was too low, and the back corner of the fan part would interfere with the standard clips when I went to print objects that used most of the bed.  I've since redesigned the fan mount to this with new fans that completely eliminate the issue.  So I guess I could go back to using normal clamps, but I just haven't had the need as of yet.  I suppose I could always thermally isolate the clips too, with some neoprene pads."

functionalprint,1wy15z,ShadowRam,1 point,Tue Feb 4 01:23:06 2014 UTC,Could you upload the file? We could really use this for our robotics team.
