cosmoandwanda,3dsj2h,Profnemesis,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:09:57 2015 UTC,T Mobile sucks. Anyone who has that service deserves fairy godparents.   Source: I have T Mobile. But no fairy godparents...
cosmoandwanda,3dsj2h,pinkfloydchick64,2,Sun Jul 19 01:15:28 2015 UTC,"I've got em, too. Only place I don't have coverage is my grocery store. Other than that it's LTE everywhere"
cosmoandwanda,3dsj2h,pinkfloydchick64,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:17:45 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! I get good service where I'm currently living, near a pretty large city, but the moment I go back to my hometown or enter the boonies it's no service at all. Oh well!"
cosmoandwanda,3dsj2h,jmetal88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:28:31 2015 UTC,"I actually have better service in the boonies! I do have issues on the highway every now and then, but honestly very happy. I just wish I could check reddit at the deli!"

I can definitely see how someone's opinion of T-Mobile would be influenced by where they live, since it seems to vary a lot from city to city."
cosmoandwanda,3dsj2h,jmetal88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:06:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd love to use them but coverage is anything but perfect ad soon as you stray from the big cities from what I hear."

cosmoandwanda,3709cw,djdes,2,Mon Jun 22 19:05:47 2015 UTC,"Technically, I think it's an audio joiner. It allows you to use smartphone headsets in PCs, as it takes the mic plug (pink) and the headphone plug (green) and converts into something to be used by this:  http://cdn3.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/iphone-3.5mm-headset-connector-pinout.jpg"
cosmoandwanda,3709cw,ThatDarnMushroom,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:03:48 2015 UTC,"It's not an audio spitter, it's just a headphone cable. Cause some older audio thingies need 2, and they're pink and green so there ya go."
cosmoandwanda,3709cw,djdes,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:06:40 2015 UTC,The 2 male connectors are both stereo.  What you describe should take two mono outs and make it into one stereo out. So there you go.
