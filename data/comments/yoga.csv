yoga,3e2z0t,asdfvbnmc,19,Tue Jul 21 15:42:55 2015 UTC,Downward dog. It's been 1 year and I still can't get my heels on the mat.
yoga,3e2z0t,turquoiseowl,5,Tue Jul 21 15:55:42 2015 UTC,"Likewise. It's been 1.5 years when I started and the teacher was all..., recovery pose. HAHAHA.  I will say it's gotten easier though but only bc I'm generally stronger now and in better shape. I have the shortest hamstrings ever (inherited from my dad with the very same) and I kind of doubt my heels will ever touch."

yoga,3e2z0t,juju440,7,Tue Jul 21 18:36:14 2015 UTC,"Weirdly enough, warrior 1. I can't seem to get my hips squared to the front (and vertical! No leaning forward!), my legs spread enough to get my front thigh close to parallel, and my back foot firmly planted at 45 without the back edge popping up. Ugghhh so simple but so harrrrrddd."

yoga,3e2z0t,zydrateriot,4,Tue Jul 21 17:56:14 2015 UTC,I had a wrist injury and spent months replacing down dog with dolphin (amongst other modifications)... Now I avoid it as much as I can!
yoga,3e2z0t,Side_Crow,3,Tue Jul 21 19:58:06 2015 UTC,"interesting. i'd love to hear more about your modifications. i have some kind of wrist injury (waiting until august for my new insurance to kick in before i go to the doctor), where anything with my wrist bent at 90 deg and weight bearing starts to hurt quite a bit (so downdog is a-ok, but not plank).  i've had success in using a foam wedge for things like sun salutations or making a fist with the sore hand in table top/etc. i think it might even be starting to heal, since it hasn't been sore at all the last couple of days  but i'm having trouble modifying for arm balances like crow, etc. i don't feel stable enough on the wedge if my hands are at all sweaty. so i've been just avoiding them, but i really want to work on them somehow :( any suggestions?"
yoga,3e2z0t,wishiwasAyla,2,Tue Jul 21 21:28:36 2015 UTC,Foam wedge is great- I used it to get down on a forearm when my other (good) hand was on the ground as usual.  And went on forearms whenever possible instead of having my wrists bend.  As for arm balances and inversions- I used it as a time to develop my forearm inversions and shoulder stands.  I did figure out a mini-crow (super compact little crow pose on forearms and about a centimeter off of the ground!). I hope you heal quickly and find inspiration in getting away from your comfort zone to allow your wrist some rest.  My practice ended up benefitting greatly from this change of pace (was about three months!) and my shoulders gained a lot of extra strength in the meantime!  Best of luck to you!
yoga,3e2z0t,Side_Crow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:43:07 2015 UTC,"thanks for the suggestions! i should definitely take the opportunity to work on forearm stand for now, since i've never been able to actually get up into it. i have been working with dolphin on the wall occasionally, so i could just focus more energy on that.  as for the mini-crow, i just got down on the floor to try it and felt like a tiny treefrog! i can see how that could help me keep developing most of the right muscle engagement though, so thanks!"

yoga,3e2z0t,saracuda,4,Tue Jul 21 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"I will either push my quads forward until there is enough support under me again to straighten my back, or ""swing"" my upper body around from the side so that I'm bending forward instead of backward, then straighten from there.

yoga,3e2z0t,chuckduck253,3,Tue Jul 21 19:30:24 2015 UTC,Toe balance. All the less experienced people in my yoga class can do it like they're gurus. It really really hurts my feet a lot. ;-;
yoga,3e2z0t,wishiwasAyla,2,Tue Jul 21 21:09:05 2015 UTC,you could add a few breaths of a tucked toe hero pose into your practice to work on stretching the soles of your feet and your toes.  could help!
yoga,3e2z0t,chuckduck253,2,Tue Jul 21 21:32:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I will definitely try that!  However, I talked to my teacher about this problem and she said it could just be that my feet don't have much padding. I used to run a lot on concrete everyday, so my feet are kinda hard and worn down. It feels like I'm pressing bare bone into the ground in toe balance."

There are many poses you can take from traditional yoga forms without the flow or the vinyasa and you can hold them for as long as you like, upwards of 30s to 2 mins is good.  In my experience, back bends are great for bjj as we use the core plenty and get stacked a lot in guard. Stretching out the stomach and bending/twisting the back makes my body feel good after rolling.   What exactly do you think would be good?"

yoga,3e1b6g,sparksy1337,3,Tue Jul 21 04:51:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not a yoga instructor at all, so take my suggestions with a grain of salt.  When starting with downward dog, don't concern yourself as much with straightness of your back or legs, those will come with time.  You want to avoid dunking your back and ribs, the swayback look is what you want to avoid.  Instead focus on weight in your hands and pressing the weight between your index finger and thumb.  I'm not particularly flexible person either (although more so now) and I HATED downward dog when I started.   I know this wasn't your question, but is all I have to offer! All the best to you!"

yoga,3e1b6g,finefeathers,3,Tue Jul 21 10:34:17 2015 UTC,Blocks might be helpful for other poses as well.
yoga,3e1b6g,DeenotheDino,2,Tue Jul 21 11:32:59 2015 UTC,"Got to thinking about it more after I posted my comment about the strap and am thinking that chair yoga might be a good idea for home practice. There is a chair mod for a wide-legged downdog that might be doable. Some of the other chair mods from this article might be helpful as well.  If you do take a class, I'd recommend trying restorative yoga. You're more likely to have people with flexibility/injury issues in that sort of class and the instructor I had always offered a lot of mods and almost everyone was using props. If you wouldn't be bothered by practicing with a lot of senior citizens, you also might see if there's a chair yoga class in your area. They're usually offered/marketed for seniors but I think someone with your particular issue could really benefit from that kind of practice.   A class labeled slowflow or gentle vinyasa might be okay, but based on your description of your problem and your trouble with downdog I would avoid regular vinyasa. There's going to be a lot more movement between poses in that style and I think that could be really frustrating and possibly dangerous for you at this point."
yoga,3e1b6g,finefeathers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:20 2015 UTC,One of my local studios offers both chair yoga and restorative.  Old people don't bother me; I work at a nursing home so we get along. :p  I'll definitely keep an eye on those and jump on it if they start offering a class at a time that works with my schedule.
yoga,3e1b6g,finefeathers,2,Tue Jul 21 16:30:37 2015 UTC,Even better!!! I liked being with the older people in my restorative class. It helped me keep things in perspective. Yoga is not a competition. Everyone has their own specific physical challenges and the important thing is just to do what you can.
yoga,3e1b6g,Hundike,2,Tue Jul 21 17:20:56 2015 UTC,"You could also look up videos on youtube and just do the poses you are comfortable with, if you want to do a flow that contains downward dog and you really can not do it you could replace it with just hands and knees on the floor or plank pose (advice here would be appreciated). Only problem I see is that downward dog is usually preceded by either upward dog or cobra which I assume is difficult for you also (you could replace those with just lying on your stomach and lifting up your torso with your hands straight and near your hips, lift just as much as you can with your core strength, even if it's only an inch).  All in all, get a book, search here (there was a topic with poses somewhere here as well) and get to know which pose does what. There's several for one area and some will be easier for you than others. Start with the easier ones. Listen to your body, don't go overboard! Don't get discouraged! If you can do twists, try that! If you can do standing poses like tree/warriors, do those! Use a strap! Use a block, towels, etc.  There's a DVD called ""Gaiam healing yoga"" by Rodney Yee, might be worth checking out. Many youtubers also answer questions, you could ask them!"

You will probably be one of a few guys, if not the only one, don't let that worry you, people are going to focus on themselves and go inwards.  Set up your mat close to the front, so you can see the teacher, don't hide in the back.  Introduce yourself to the teacher and say you are new to yoga, and describe any injuries you have.  It may be useful to google a few images of the basic poses so you know what is going on. I would recommend starting with the easiest class possible, and then work your way up. Stay within your own limits, especially since you don't quite what they are know.  Take frequent rests (child's pose, table top), make sure you are not overly dumping weight into knees and wrists. The purpose of the practice is to calm the mind, strength and flexibility are side effects. Yoga is a long journey, welcome and good luck."
yoga,3dwdk4,juhhal,3,Mon Jul 20 18:21:50 2015 UTC,"Just echoing what others have said. You can do it!  I personally have some bad social anxiety especially with new things like fitness classes, but something that always helps knock me into my senses is thinking ""if I regularly went to this class and I saw someone new, what would I think of them?"" the answer is usually ""oh cool I hope they enjoy this class!"" or ""absolutely nothing and focus on my own practice""."
yoga,3dwdk4,araradia,2,Mon Jul 20 19:17:14 2015 UTC,"Yoga's mostly just great, so any place you start is a good place. I wouldn't shell out for a special studio unless you find that your gym's sessions aren't right for you.  I'd maybe suggest not trying heated/Bikram yoga immediately. Bikram is seriously grueling even when you're in shape and you'll want to have a good grasp of the poses before you start adding ""killing myself"" to the mix. But yeah, most gym classes will give you experience with the poses and help you gain flexibility and strength. Do the poses as fully as you can without risking hurting yourself, stick through the initial soreness and it'll start paying off."
yoga,3dwdk4,Isthisathroaway,2,Mon Jul 20 05:11:18 2015 UTC,If you can find someone to go with you this can help.  There's a yoga buddy listing on this forum ;).  Also it's helpful to get to class early and talk to the instructor.  This can help with putting you at ease and a good one should tell you to just sit out and observe if you aren't feeling into the postures.
yoga,3dwdk4,Blubtrflygrl1,2,Mon Jul 20 09:45:26 2015 UTC,"Try everything! Even the big scary Bikram. As a teacher I've had so many never ever done yoga men in my Bikram classes. They actually have found it a lot more approachable then other yoga. It is just asana, the postures, and will show you results very quickly if you dedicate time out of your week for it. You can sit down, in fact please do, you can sit in the back and just become accustomed to the heat and the fact that you are in a yoga class. Drink lots of water before and after. Water during will actually make you feel sick. The classes are always the same, which is comforting. You start to know the postures and know what to expect rather then have a random posture thrown in there. You don't know unless you try :)"

It's a lot easier to get into it if you know a bit beforehand from my experience. Don't expect to follow everything, don't push yourself too far! You want to do what feels comfortable for you and if you need to go slower or skip something that does not feel good, just do that!  Don't get into yoga comparing yourself with anyone else! Do it for yourself. Everyone began from somewhere and nobody will look down on you for taking care of yourself (I went to a yoga class without any previous experience and it wasn't half as bad as I expected, being a beginner one it was not too difficult to follow and everyone was more focused on themselves rather than what everyone else is doing)."

A couple of weeks ago the only available class during my time slot was Hatha yoga. I braced myself and jumped right in and it's AMAZING. First off, no one cares how much you weigh, they are happy you are doing something for your well being, no one cares if you can't stand on your head right away, but they will encourage you to return until you can, and lastly, you will very likely feel amazing after class.

yoga,3dtj88,hurtstopurr,3,Sun Jul 19 08:48:12 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.  In my experience they are related but not the same.  I practice Ashtanga Yoga and that has been described to me as moving meditation. In Ashtanga I am really just thinking about breath and body during that time, I am not sure qualifies as meditation but I think it is close.  However in a Flow/Power type Yoga class with music I find it less meditative although there is still some aspects of meditation and a focus on breath and body as there is in all Yoga.  Many of my Yoga teachers do offer or partake in meditation in classes which are offered at different times than their Yoga classes.  Personally I would try to find an Intro to Ashtanga Yoga and go from there.  If you are not somewhere where that is offered I would just look for an intro to Yoga and see where it takes you, you will learn more and make connections and find what you are looking for from there."
yoga,3dtj88,stockbridge21112,3,Sun Jul 19 10:34:36 2015 UTC,"Ashtanga yoga has 8 limbs,  two of which are meditation and asana (which is the physical practice). If you meditate, you are practicing yoga.  If you practice asana, you are practicing yoga. To start, search Google for ""how to start meditating"" or ""easy yoga for beginners"". Or find a studio near you- they are typically very welcome of beginners"
yoga,3dtj88,marushkababu,3,Sun Jul 19 11:11:10 2015 UTC,"For a starter on just meditation, I recommend the book Wherever You Go, There You Are . It is very accessible to anyone (religious/spiritual or not, yogi or not, practiced in meditation or not, etc), the book is comprised of loads of small sections that can be read at will or all the way through at once, includes ""TRY"" to exercises to guide practice. A quick but impactful read."
yoga,3dtj88,foxydingo,2,Sun Jul 19 11:59:00 2015 UTC,"They are not the same thing.  Asana (what you think of as yoga) and dhyana (meditation) are two limbs of raja yoga, which can best be described as a way of life.    To get into either meditation or yoga, try classes for either."
yoga,3dtj88,EzekielMurphy,4,Sun Jul 19 11:22:56 2015 UTC,I imagine them as two aspects of the same thing. If you are doing meditation with a bad posture you will have problems to benefit from it and if you are doing asanas without the meditational aspects you will also not benefit that much.  I experienced my classes as meditational. We are guided during the asanas not to focus anymore on all the thoughts we may have and instead to concentrate on our breath and to be fully present in the now. For me that is meditation.
yoga,3dtj88,Baru84,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:02:40 2015 UTC,"I imagine them as two aspects of the same thing.   I experienced my classes as meditational.  ... be fully present in the now. For me that is meditation.    The difference between ""meditational"" and ""meditation"" is the difference between ""golden"" and ""gold"".   It is very difficult for many people to sit still for very long, and even harder for them to get their minds to focus on anything for any period at all.     So people often want to claim the peaceful, relaxing and calming effects of their favorite practice as a form of meditation.      That's a wonderful place to start, and there is nothing wrong with that, but deep meditation and the effects of a committed meditation practice are amazing, wonderful, and tremendously life-altering and mind-blowing.     So I am leaving this comment here in case someone is thinking about taking up a meditation practice.   Meditation and yoga definitely go hand in hand, as yoga/asana was designed to support meditation in a much bigger framework of classical yoga, but the two are not the same."

In short (from what I understand) the purpose of yoga is to make you connect to your spiritual self and to others around you (and the world around you), taking care of your physical body is the start since if you feel good in your body you can feel good in your mind.  Start with beginner yoga and also take meditation classes, don't just do one or the other, they should be connected. You can always go to a class and ask your instructor for advice!"
yoga,3dtj88,araradia,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:29:52 2015 UTC,You can start both at the same time or start meditating before you start doing yoga or whatever you want.

Do what you're interested in.

In the West, we often say yoga is a moving meditation, and it can be, but I think the original purpose of physical practice is to set the stage for meditation."

yoga,3dqlcz,jgenovese,3,Sat Jul 18 16:53:35 2015 UTC,"Think more about bringing your head/upper body forward than down towards the ground. You'll probably be pretty low to the ground no matter what, especially at first, but the key movement you're going for is shifting your weight forward so it's situated directly over your hands. That's what makes the balance work.  Other than that: eventually (especially as you're working towards crane), you'll want your knees on your upper arms, but at first it might be easier to set your shins on your upper arms instead, with your knees outside your arms, like this. That'll lower your center of gravity, which also makes the balance a bit easier in my experience."
yoga,3dqlcz,sillyh00ves,2,Sat Jul 18 17:15:08 2015 UTC,Think about putting more weight into your fingers instead of on your wrists. Your fingers are stronger than you think and if you play with shifting your weight into your fingers it will help you learn how to stabilize.

yoga,3dn1g9,rosemarily,42,Fri Jul 17 16:29:47 2015 UTC,"Speaking from the standpoint of a man, I definitely built muscle a lot faster using weights, but it was a lot harder on my body. Guys always ask me if they'll get my physique if they do yoga, and I say no. It is very unlikely to get a muscular build from yoga alone. Look at a lot of the Indians that practice (Iyengar for example), almost no muscle definition. If, as a man, aesthetic appeal is what you're after, you'll need to incorporate some form of strength training. Gymnastics style workouts are excellent to pair with yoga and are good for building muscle.

yoga,3dn1g9,Dakewlguy,4,Sat Jul 18 06:40:57 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense! This might just be a version of ""bro science"" but I feel like my understanding is: if its just body weight, you're not really going to put on THAT much new muscle. Need to increase weight a lot for that to happen... (well, but that's not true in gymnastics, so IDK what im thinking)  So I'm not even quite sure how to explain my ""toned"" aesthetic scientifically ha. Like I do feel like I look the same as when I was doing stronglifts primarily, but at that point i was almost 10 lbs heavier with muscle. SO i feel like what is happening and has been happening the last few weeks is not that I gained new muscle, I just am maintaining whatever gains were left, and decreasing body fat so it makes me look more musclar than I am at this time."
yoga,3dn1g9,earpicus,6,Fri Jul 17 19:27:28 2015 UTC,"wanted to chime in here.  it is completely possible to put on a hefty amount of muscle with bodyweight only.  it's not as straightforward a process as putting more weight on a bar since there are sometimes substantial skill gaps between progressions that also need working on.  it's not just about the upper limit of how much your body weights that gives increases in strength and muscle size, but also progressively decreasing the mechanical advantage of the position so your body has less and less leverage and thus has to work harder and harder with the muscles to move or maintain position of your bodyweight.  for the majority of folks(bodybuilders or power lifters aside) the upper limit on bodyweight exercises is far beyond the amount of muscle/strength they are looking for.  i will say yoga specifically doesn't really do much for pulling muscles so some bar or ring work at least is a good supplement, but as you approach gymnastic style movements that could be considered yoga such as handstand pushups(handstand to tripod headstand or chinstand and back), handstand presses, one armed inversions/arm balances, or lowering down from handstand to chatturanga and holding in a planche position on the way will get you reasonably buff.  all that said i'm also not really a fan of bodyweight only leg work either so i prefer to squat, but pistols or ""shiva squats"" are decent.  in the end your body doesn't know the difference between the resistance coming from more iron on a bar or decreased leverage.  push your strength progressively and muscle will grow.  just bodyweight/yoga based isn't as fast because of the gaps between progressions and skill components that can take quite a while to learn."
yoga,3dn1g9,mcmunchie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:38:14 2015 UTC,"i will say yoga specifically doesn't really do much for pulling muscles    I'm not an expert in this, but do you mean concentric contractions?  As far as I know, you can utilize all three types of muscle contractions in a practice.   I had to do physical therapy for my rotator cuff and when the inflammation went down, my doctor had me do vinyasas with my shoulders properly engaged to strengthen my back. He acknowledged that it's harder to build those muscles with only bodyweight, but because I don't have a gym membership, chaturangas, upward dogs and rolling side planks were a big part of my rehab.  I think a lot of it is proper form. My rotator cuffs were inflamed because I wasn't engaging my shoulder girdle at all. I didn't even know there was anything back there to engage."
yoga,3dn1g9,earpicus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:49:53 2015 UTC,"no i mean pulling as in utilizing your biceps, lats, etc as primary movers.  since it's just you and a floor in yoga it's hard to generate significant resistance with your body when pulling like in rowing or pullup motions.  yeah i had a rotator cuff issue as well.  some lying side external rotations with low weight or a resistance band was what has worked wonders for me.  still do them as pre-hab during every handbalancing class or at home after yoga."
yoga,3dn1g9,mcmunchie,2,Mon Jul 20 17:34:42 2015 UTC,"Yoga does incorporate those muscles though, at least according to my anatomy books. Like in upward dog, it's not just pushing against the floor but also using your shoulders to lift you up. My biceps have gotten significantly stronger as well. Not to the extent of going to a gym but I do think it's a balanced practice."
yoga,3dn1g9,earpicus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:01:43 2015 UTC,"it can use those muscles somewhat, but the amount of resistance compared to the pushing you do in yoga is pretty minimal.  keeping your shoulders depressed away from your ears in updog is neither terribly hard nor a substantial range of motion.  it's also more of a vertical push down than a pull, engaging more of the serratus and lower trapezius than much lat recruitment.  not to say you cant get stronger or find some decent ways to work the biceps like peacock with hands facing backward will rely a fair amount on biceps to keep your elbows from collapsing but again it is a static posture without much range of motion.  i'm a huge proponent of yoga, but for joint health i recommend pretty much everyone do some minimal pulling work such as horizontal rows and chinups to help balance out the rather push dominant practice.  all that said it kind of depends on how hard you're pushing yourself with the push-dominant aspect.  if you're doing a bunch of handstand presses every class and yet no pulling motions of similar intensity your shoulder joints will get unbalanced, posture worsened, and potential for shoulder injury from unbalanced musculature increases.  however if the most intense pushing you do during yoga is chatturanga or crow the imbalance won't be as noticeable."
yoga,3dn1g9,mcmunchie,0,Mon Jul 20 18:31:28 2015 UTC,"I don't mean keeping my shoulder blades depressed; I mean I'm using my lats to pin my shoulder blades to my spine.   For what it's worth, just googling ""yoga and latissimus"" brings up a lot of results, including books which mention how the muscles are recruited in poses like upward dog.   I feel like a lot of this depends where you are consciously recruiting muscles. If I'm really trying to make sure I'm lifting my legs in upward dog, I'll probably be more sore in my quads. And to your last point, I think it depends on what poses and how often, since I don't do handstands but I do perform a lot of vinyasas.   Edit: As I said - and is obvious - I'm not an expert, and I don't want to hinge the discussion of lat recruitment in yoga on things like ""pin my shoulder blades to my spine"" because that's just how I think of it. I am essentially turning on my traps to bring down my shoulders, my serratus to widen them and my lats to lift myself up and forward. My arms are just there to support me.  I think down dog is also a lat strengthener if you avoid putting weight on your hands, instead lifting from the spine. On that note, I think using your entire body to lift and not just pushing with your arms is key to a lot of yoga."
yoga,3dn1g9,iswamwithwhales,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:01:44 2015 UTC,"It's not bro science, you're spot on.. To put it simply, you damage your muscle with resistance training, and in response they heal and grow. With your own body weight you can get only so far in terms of strength, muscle size and the resulting ""tone"".  The cool thing about bodyweight and gymnastics stuff is that a whole lot of it is stability based. Doing bikram yoga, for example, really crushed some unused muscles in my feet that I never activated before apparently, despite working on legs a lot."

Haha That would be nice. I found doing yoga has improved my balance, especially going up and down stairs, and wearing heels. I also do squats and other leg exercises regularly. Yoga makes squats easier, too! You keep correct posture by default, and looser hips makes the down motion easier.  Some people on the internet claim it has improved their connection with their body. Like, being more in tune with it. I can't speak for you, but I agree with these claims. I notice when I'm full faster. I can tell a little better when I have just a craving and real hunger. Maybe that helped you lose some weight?  Man, I love yoga."

The biggest thing I've noticed (beyond the increased strength/flexibility/weightloss) is just how crappy I feel when I take a couple weeks off from doing yoga (like when I went on a 2.5 week vacation and then my instructor was on vacation when I got back). I feel super stiff and sore and it makes me wonder how I ever survived before doing yoga on the regular.  I'm down 20 lbs this year and it's primarily due to yoga and a change in diet. It's awesome :)

My sleep has improved (chronic insomnia) - I went from 2 ambiens (at least 2, woo that was a rough time) per night, to 60 mg of a sleeping pill, now 1 mg of the same pill.  I think my physical appearance stayed more or less the same, at least to other people.  (I imagine I see every pound gained and lost.)   I've gone through a lot of life and work changes that contributed to a lot of physical changes but I attribute the sensitivity to yoga and in large part the improvement in insomnia - not because the practice necessarily ""fixed"" me, but it helped learn about what my body needed for sleep."

yoga,3dn1g9,lowflyingmeat,2,Sat Jul 18 05:36:00 2015 UTC,"I do weightlifting, bicycling, and sometimes rowing. I have done hot yoga (Bikram and Moksha (canadian)) on and off, typically buying a ""all you can sweat pass"" for a month and going 4-6 times a week.  Like what others have said, you won't make tremendous muscle development nor will you really get toned. I didn't notice too much weight loss after a month to be honest, I noticed more by doing cycling. But I am in pretty good shape already.  What I did notice was a change in mood and sleep patterns, it helped during winter months when I can't cycle and feeling a bit too lazy to lift. I did feel a lot more loose (physically). I'll say this though, it won't help your cardiovascular as your heart rate will never-ever get into that zone. I've done it for 2 months straight and saw good relaxation, reasonable weight loss, and skin clarity (lol). But at the start of the cycling season? 3-4 hour long rides for 2 weeks can lose more weight and get your cardio going better.  It's really hard to say, I still enjoy it but it is expensive as hell quite frankly. It's $100/month if you sign a 4 month contract here in Canada but a gym membership is only $400-600 for an entire year. Some gyms are also adding free hot yoga (the instruction and atmosphere isn't as good though to be frank). It's hard to stomach $100/month on yoga when I can ride April-Oct for free on trails on a bicycle.  Though I truly believe if you want to stay active till you're an old person, you need to do yoga or basically dedicated stretching for a few hours/week. Yoga simply makes stretching for an hour-90 minutes way more relaxing/enjoyable. Also the meditation aspect is proven science, it's good to just blank out for an hour and listen to your breath."

yoga,3dosgr,nolongeralurker,3,Sat Jul 18 02:58:10 2015 UTC,"As simple as it sounds really focusing on my breathing was the most helpful thing for me throughout labour.   In early labour breathing techniques and visualisation really helped me (eg. Imagining the contractions as waves coming into shore - breathing in as the contraction starts and imagining the wave come in, then after the peak breathing out and imagining the wave receding.) You could try a repetitive slow movement with breath if something physical generally suits you better.  As labour progressed I found supported down dog/ half forward fold (same as the pic linked to in the other comment) provided relief.   As an aside my partner and I read a book called Birth Skills by Juju Sundin which, while not the best read (repetitive and a bit hippy la la in parts), it was very useful in hindsight. It gave me the confidence that I could contribute to my own pain management...in ways other than screaming  for ALL the drugs ;) . I still had some drugs but I think I lasted a lot longer and was calmer through the birth than I might have been otherwise. It really helped us to know what to expect and helped my partner be an excellent support person."

I sat by some of the people who work with on of the vendors tents today passing judgment on the ""yuppies"" that attend Wanderlust and putting down the very people that are supporting their goods.

Based off my own experiences it seems one the largest yoga communities in the US is this ""Lulu Lemon"" yoga community.   To get to my point I understand why you find may feel uncomfortable at wanderlust. Although they are doing yoga. At what level of consciousness are they practicing?   Are they doing it just to benefit their physical body so they can look ""sexy"", or want to have a healthier body?   Are they practicing to expand the awareness of their breath, mind, emotions?    Also expectations can really build you up to crash you down. If you go to wanderlust expecting something than it may ruin your experience  if it's something else."

Not complaining, it probably just takes a while.   With standing fold and downward dog it helped me when someone suggested bending from the hips (think about halfway down your butt) rather than bending entirely with the back, which will only bend so much.   (I wish someone had told me that at the beginning, but come to think of it maybe someone did and the advice is only registering with me now because I have developed enough additional hip flexibility to make the advice useful.)"

I feel so far behind most people in class.  I modify lots of poses so I do them correctly, safely and engage the right body parts. Bent knees are your friend! I struggle to do tons of stuff many women can roll into the studio with the ability to do in day one. My pigeon still looks pathetic compared to my neighbors but I'm protecting my knees and keeping my hips level. So who gives a shit?  If one day a week is all you can spare can you do a short home practice on off days? You need reps! Body weight fitness is great too.  Just protect yourself.  This isn't a battle it's a war.

yoga,3djcdm,Iamkid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:30:01 2015 UTC,"Hello friend!   A couple suggestions:  Learn to use props, yoga blocks, yoga strap/belt, and anything else that you could use to aid you. At the gym most people overcompensate their technique to lift heavier weights. In the same way I've notice a lot people force themselves deeper, over-twist, and over stretch during poses thinking it's better for them. Be very gentle with your self and don't be afraid to ask an instructor how to incorporate using tools/props to help you embrace a pose/stretch.   Also you mentioned you've been working at a desk job for a while. Sitting for prolonged amounts of time can round your lower back and shoulders. If your lower back feels ""tight"" than stretching it may be the exact opposite thing you'll want to do.   Consider this: If your low-back is rounded (think picking something off the floor while standing) it's in a perpetual state of being stretched. Therefore you could cause more harm stretching an already over-stretched muscle. Does this make sense?   An analogy that I like to use: If you have a rubber band that's being stretched would you want to stretch the rubber band more? No because it would break. Instead by shortening the rubber band it can go back to its normal/healthy tension.   If your back is over-stretched and rounded from prolonged sitting I would suggest doing exercises/yoga poses that with strengthen and shorten the muscles in the low-back to help loosen and bring relief to the low-back."

Yes, injuries happen, but there are actual things we can do to prevent injury by learning more about the body's anatomy.

I still feel that it's the most powerful and prana intense practice. But as I spent longer in the practice  then I saw and heard about all the great teachers and their knee/spine/hip injuries. The teaching tells you how to use harness strength and prana to go deeper, but just a second of mindlessness and then you've tweaked or sprained something, usually at a joint. Whenever the teacher got injured it was always the same line about it being part of the practice and journey. I get that and respect that they treat the injury as an opportunity to learn.

yoga,3degmc,Anagatam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:30:35 2015 UTC,It appeared that you were suggesting that her injury was due to repetitive stress from her practice.

Its not uncommon for athletes to have injuries which happen outside of training but due to the imbalances caused by years and years of training.

With me as well, it snuck up on me, and while there was some aching, I didn't realize there was a problem until it got bad."
