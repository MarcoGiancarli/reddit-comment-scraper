verizon,3e54ui,NeedFilmAdvice,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:02:13 2015 UTC,Is the EDGE eligible line out of contract?
verizon,3e54ui,duane534,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:27:06 2015 UTC,"Not sure I understand your question. The Edge eligible line is the one I used to get the S6 on, so I assume it is now currently in a contract (and will be for the remaining 21 months of the 24 month Edge contract).  All I recall was that my actual line was upgrade eligible but not Edge eligible, but the other line was Edge eligible. So I was instructed I could order through that and do the switch."
verizon,3e54ui,duane534,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:16:42 2015 UTC,"You can get a $25 discount on your line for being out of contract, then."
verizon,3e54ui,duane534,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:28:12 2015 UTC,"I guess I might have misspoke. The line I transferred the phone to still has a contract until 11/2015. It was from when another person on my account used my upgrade eligibility to get a new phone back in 11/2013, which then reset my end date to 11/2015. So it looks like that option is out for me.  However, I'm still confused on why I'm not getting the $25 Edge credit that was repeatedly promised to me even when doing the buy and switch method. (It was the reps idea in the first place to do that method.)"
verizon,3e54ui,duane534,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:43:06 2015 UTC,Is the other line out of contract? Somebody has to be.
verizon,3e54ui,duane534,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:57:13 2015 UTC,"My account has eight devices. At the time of purchase, the system showed my '4093' line as the only 'Edge Eligible' line. That was what the in store rep told me, at least. I assume this means that at the time of attempting purchase of the S6, my '4093' line was not in a contract, so I was able to join into a new Edge agreement free and clear with that line.  My actual line '1226' was not upgrade eligible (Edge or otherwise) and had a contract end date of 11/2015 (and still does). All I did was purchase the phone to '4093' on an Edge agreement, and then activated it on '1226'. Am I missing something?"
verizon,3e54ui,breakingcustoms,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:08:02 2015 UTC,Is 4093 off contract?
verizon,3e54ui,maryhadalittlefist,-1,Wed Jul 22 03:18:44 2015 UTC,"No, it's on contract. But why wouldn't it be? It's the line I signed up on the Edge program with three months ago.  On the device overview for 4093, it says ""This device was purchased under a Verizon Edge Agreement.""  My device upgrade eligibility page lists the 4093 line as: ""This Device is under Verizon Edge Agreement. You are not currently eligible for Edge Up""  That would mean it's on contract, right? Or am I misunderstanding what you mean by ""on contract?"" Is there a definitive way to figure this out by looking at my account? I feel like I'm missing something."
verizon,3e54ui,maryhadalittlefist,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:30:35 2015 UTC,EDGE doesn't put you under contract.   You should use MyVerizon to see which lines aren't.
verizon,3e54ui,maryhadalittlefist,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:36:50 2015 UTC,"The MyVerizon app? Or MyVerizon section online. I'm not the primary number on the full account, so the MyVerizon app on my '1226' device only shows info for that line. Via the website I don't see what page I need to be looking for exactly.  Online under MyVerizon, My Account, My Plans and Services, it shows the 4093 line as having a contract end date of ""month to month"", an upgrade available of '-' and a button that says ""See EDGE details"".   I asked a chat rep if the '4093' line was currently on contract just 5 minutes ago, and they responded with: ""It's under an EDGE agreement."" I pressed harder, and they said: ""No, it's not on contract.""  Edit: So what you're saying is that I should be able to argue that my 4093 is not on a contract, thus I should be getting a $25 credit for having a line off contract? I'll definitely use that when the escalation call comes back."
verizon,3e54ui,AnchorsUP,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:48:08 2015 UTC,"This is all too common with Edge. In our region we were informed of this happening.

verizon,3e54ui,AnchorsUP,3,Wed Jul 22 01:34:22 2015 UTC,I have done this switch no less than 100 times this year. Every single time it gives the line that has the new edge agreement an edge discount as long as that line keeps a smartphone on it.
verizon,3e54ui,AnchorsUP,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:13:08 2015 UTC,"Are they giving direction of what to do with people who already did the buy/swap three months ago? If Verizon keeps recordings, I can guarantee that I have at least one rep (if not three) telling me that I can do the buy and swap and then also confirming I will be getting $25 off a month. It's the whole reason I went with Edge. What's my best course of action in correcting this when I get the escalated call back in 72 hours?"
verizon,3e54ui,maryhadalittlefist,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:18:46 2015 UTC,The line that got the new edge agreement 3 months ago(not the line that ended up with the phone)... Does it currently have a smartphone active on it?

The insurance will only replace your phone with another s4.  2) check to see if you are early edge eligible without the need to turn in your current device. If not,  3) you will need to find a replacement phone on eBay, amazon, swappa, etc."

verizon,3e4w1v,stop_runs,5,Tue Jul 21 23:50:51 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you have two seperate accounts.  If that is the case combining them would be the best option on the more everything plan.  With 10gb and two line access fees you would pay around 160 a month.  Now speaking of buying the phones out right save yourself the money and do them on edge.  If your account is qualified and you don't have to do a deposit you can get both phone at the cost of $25 a month.  You will receive a credit towards your line access of of $25 a month as along as you have 6 gigs or more of data.  In a since the samsung s6 32gb phone would wash itself out so you wouldn't see a drastic change in the bill.  Now the first thing you should find out is who gets a better employee discount you or her.  That is the name the account needs to be in so that you can apply the larger discount.  Easy break down is 10gb $80, line access $15, line access $15, equipment cost $25 samsung s6, and equipment cost $25 samsung s6.  The only variance you will see is in taxes and which phone you put on edge.  Upside to edge is when you have one month away to upgrade and your phone is broken just pay the equipment cost off and upgrade that day.  If you add insurance tack on $22 for both of your phones which I do recommend.   More people come in with broken phones who have insurance and it's their saving grace."
verizon,3e4w1v,howlingmage,2,Wed Jul 22 00:40:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly you should go to a store and have someone assess the condition of her phone. Crapping out can mean a lot of things, but the conditions for early edge have basically nothing to do with software issues. If the phone isn't cracked or showing signs of water damage, it most likely qualifies for early edge. That being said, going to the 10 GB plan now makes the most sense, as it is only considered promotional at the $80 rate as of now. Take advantage of it while you can. Also, please don't pay me money if you deem this worthy. Donate it to charity or something."
verizon,3e4w1v,Th595906,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:42:33 2015 UTC,"if the more everything plan is going to be cheaper than what you're paying now theres no reason to not combine into one plan, it won't change your upgrade dates or anything like that but it sounds like it would save you money"
verizon,3e4w1v,BKC501,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:40:43 2015 UTC,"I'll deal with the plans first. Regardless of when you change plans more everything plans are a lot better than the old nation wide plans. Since you are up first I'd use your line as the guinea pig and for for the current 10gb for $80 dollar plan. (someone mentioned this plan will be extended to 8/31)  I would next find out what kind of early edge you qualify for by calling customer service as some don't require you to send in a phone (Note: these are rare but can happen) when you upgrade with edge you pay taxes on the phone around $35 up front, get a $25 per month discount for using edge, pay $25 a month for the phone for 2 years when it's paid off. So based off my plan and not knowing your employee discounts it would be $80 for the plan + $15 for the line ($40-$25 edge discount) + $25 for the phone itself + roughly $30 for verizon/government surcharges and fees. Total would be about $160.  Now when we add your wife in you would get her phone line of $15 added on and her (roughly $25) phone cost added onto the bill. With this the bill should be about $200. The benefit of this plan change will be unlimited talk and text for both of you and the shared 10gb of data (side benefit of 25gb of verizon cloud if that's useful for you) As for right now you could both find a Verizon moto x for $200-$300 I'm not quite sure if you want to get a better phone to help ease the wait. Swappa is recommended for quality used phones that should work.  (If I qualify for the $5 prize go get yourself some ice cream on me and don't worry about it)"
verizon,3e4w1v,Jared-Steffen,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:50:05 2015 UTC,"Combine the plans. Trade her phone in for early edge. (They only look for physical damage, not software glitches) Wait for your upgrade. 10Gb is $80. One phone in contract is 40, her line on edge is 15, and 20 for her phone payment on a Turbo (I'd bet that's your only option on that early promo) Once yours is up, Edge to S6, stays the same @ $155 +tax, insurance, and anything else you add on."
verizon,3e4w1v,rhynoplaz,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:53:16 2015 UTC,"Before doing any upgrades you need to do an ""Assumption of liability"" and merge the two accounts in the name of whoever will be getting the discount through the employer.  Once you do that you will both still be able to upgrade without any issues. As for a plan I advise that you get the 10GB Share everything plan. It's on a promotion right now for $80 and it includes unlimited talk and text.  You will both have line access fee's of $40 each. Making the combined bill $160. If you think you're both capable of staying under 6GB a month you can save another $10 by lowering the amount of data from 10GB to 6GB.  As long as you're on a 6GB plan or higher you'll qualify for the $25 Edge credit on each line. What this means to you is instead of paying $200 for the standard upgrade, you will just pay sales tax in store and you'll put the device cost on the bill.  The GS6 retail is $649.99. If you divide that number by 24 [months] you will have your device payment cost which is $27.08. Minus your $25 credit each month that phone will cost you $2.08 a month and at the end of two years it will of costed you a total of $60 which is much better that $200 upfront.  Let me know if I can advise on anything else - good luck!"

Because I can tell you that if it was done in store cust service is going to want them to credit it. And if it was done over the phone the store probably won't budge. They have bosses to explain that too and they aren't responsible for the other groups mess up.   But that's why the credit dropped off and it's going to be a fight. Because it comes down to he said/she said. Your saying they didn't inform you about that but they would probably deny that.    I don't work for them btw. So I have no skin in the game. Just being honest

On edge you're paying installments of the MSRP for 24 months. You pay just the tax off of the MSRP upfront. There is no activation fee. Your line access, which is $40, gets a $15 or $25 discount depending on your data plan."

After your line is put off contract it will go to edge pricing which is either 25 or 30 (?) Depending on your data package.

verizon,3du27j,OldSpaceChaos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:31:56 2015 UTC,"Early EDGE is one of the only circumstances where you are still in a contract AND still get the EDGE discount.  Typically EDGE discount = M2M/out-of-contract discount.  Typically, when you're on EDGE, you're already out of contract.  However, Early EDGE lets you get the EDGE discount (provided that you trade in the phone that you got subsidized on-contract).  So, even though you would, say, be in-contract till Jan 2016 ('required' to pay $40/month till end-date), you can get the $15/$25 EDGE discount, as long as you're on EDGE.  I've read that if you pay off your EDGE phone early, technically there would be no more EDGE agreement, so you'd lose your EDGE discount and then go back up to $40/month till the remainder of your contract."

I've had a lot of customers come in with S5s/Note3s whose dialer would force close when trying to make a call after upgrading to lollipop.  Customer service/a verizon store/a samsung rep at bestbuy can help you trouble shoot the phone and, if that fails, help you with the rma process.  Quick recommendation: back up all your files onto a computer(photos, music, etc), then do a factory data reset. The troubleshooting will include this step anyway.

CAT6a is a good choice for in-home wiring. For a router, look for something that is DD-WRT or Tomato supported (ASUS Routers are super easy to flash, and hard to brick) as it'll pay off in the long run.  Just be aware that Verizon doesn't support FiOS Internet all too well without their router. So once you buy your own, hit up eBay or Craigslist and purchase a used FiOS router from somebody."

verizon,3dkpjt,ghmmr91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:21:45 2015 UTC,"I'm currently on a 2 year contract, with one with a smart phone on the main line and an extra line using a basic phone.  6gbs data, more everything plan.  Current bill is around $130."
verizon,3dkpjt,Curtisbeef,2,Fri Jul 17 01:49:37 2015 UTC,"The full MSRP of the GS6 is $600.  Essentially you'll be paying $200 for the GS6 and the activation fee of $40 on the bill, for a 2 year contract. Your line access of $40 stays the same.  On Edge you're paying the $600 in installments of 24 months which is $25/mo. Now with a 6gb data plan you get a $25 discount off of your line access. So essentially it's a wash. You would just pay just the sale tax upfront. (You'd pay $53 where I'm from). There's no activation fee. You can upgrade when you want (pay off the $600) and there's no contract. No reason why you shouldn't do edge."
verizon,3dkpjt,ghmmr91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:54:49 2015 UTC,Does the Edge plan cover everyone in the family? or is it per line?  My sister upgraded to Edge to get her phone. I am on the same family plan. We have the 10GB plan.  If another line signs up for edge do those discounts stack?  Thanks
verizon,3dkpjt,duane534,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:52:06 2015 UTC,It's per line and the edge discounts are stackable
verizon,3dkpjt,Jared-Steffen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:02:22 2015 UTC,This is great! Thanks for clarifying it for me
verizon,3dkpjt,infinitemethod,3,Fri Jul 17 15:56:04 2015 UTC,"If you're on 6 GB or higher, you want to buy on EDGE. Period."
verizon,3dkpjt,ghmmr91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:53:16 2015 UTC,Basically with a 2 year contact you'll pay $200 up front plus taxes and an activation fee and your bill will stay the same.   If you use edge you'll pay taxes on the phone  up front usually $30-50 and will pay for the phone each month. The benefit of edge is dependent on your current plan with verizon of your on the new More Everything plans you'll get a $15 edge discount on a 4gb plan or a $25 discount on 6gb and higher.  So if the phone is $25 a month and you get a $25 discount your bill will stay the same.
verizon,3dkpjt,infinitemethod,0,Fri Jul 17 01:38:38 2015 UTC,"This isn't a wash.  2 year contract - $212 for phone, plus 24 months at $40.  $1,172 total plus $40 activation fee.  Edge $600 phone - $61 upfront (first payment and tax).  23 months at $40 ($15 line fee, $25 for phone) $981 total.  No activation fee.  Also, after the device is paid off, your line fee goes back to $15 with Edge.  If you do a contract it stays at $40 forever."
verizon,3dkpjt,ghmmr91,3,Fri Jul 17 06:02:57 2015 UTC,"Everything you said is correct except:   If you do a contract it stays at $40 forever.   Once the two year contract is fulfilled, the line access will be eligible for the out of contract discount."
verizon,3dkpjt,infinitemethod,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:09:01 2015 UTC,When did they start doing that?

verizon,3dkpjt,infinitemethod,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:00:50 2015 UTC,That's great!  Actually have a phone coming off a 2 year shortly and look forward to the discount.
verizon,3dkpjt,Ropes4u,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:02:43 2015 UTC,So edge is better if you are going to upgrade more that every two years?  Does the edge plan have an insurance option?
verizon,3dkpjt,Skyhawk1200,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:19:39 2015 UTC,"It's cheaper overall, and yes, you get to upgrade very 18 months.  Plus, you're not in a contract and can buy out the phone if you ever want to leave Verizon.  Insurance wise, you pay the same amount with Edge or a 2 year agreement."
verizon,3dkpjt,Skyhawk1200,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:11:06 2015 UTC,Thank you
verizon,3dkpjt,Marowski,-1,Sat Jul 18 03:28:01 2015 UTC,"In addition to what everyone else has said about the differences, I was told by Verizon support that you can't keep your phone purchased through Edge when you want to get an upgrade; you're required to give it back to Verizon."
verizon,3dkpjt,1800KitchenFire,2,Sat Jul 18 02:28:16 2015 UTC,hmm. I would assume this is only if you haven't finished paying on it.
verizon,3dkpjt,infinitemethod,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:30:02 2015 UTC,"That might be the case, but they just said you had to give it back. If I were to get Edge now, they were going to try to take my current phone which wasn't even purchased through Verizon."
verizon,3dkpjt,ghmmr91,-3,Sat Jul 18 02:40:32 2015 UTC,"There is a catch though. According to one of the local sales personnel, if you Edge up with your current phone, and it is damaged, many stores will take it. However, you will receive a $300 bill for it. My wife went yesterday to get a new phone by upgrading her Edge plan, and the guy said it would be a bad idea to exchange her phone, because of that bill.  He said many stores won't tell you about it, so they get the $300 added to their commission."

verizon,3di154,fanoffanless,3,Thu Jul 16 13:03:37 2015 UTC,"iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will be whitelisted eventually. The reason everyone wanted the Nexus 6 so badly (and Verizon did eventually listen) is the online sales. Eventually Verizon will whitelist them. And if they don't a very quick lawsuit could change that (we discussed this before. By Verizon 'allowing' but a the same time not letting me activate the damn thing, they are on the edge of 700 mhz restrictions, so my guess is it won't be long)"
verizon,3di154,TheOnlyProfelec,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:47:28 2015 UTC,"iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will be whitelisted eventually.   Apple released them 10 months ago. . . .

I used the phone on AT&T and T-Mobile before switching to Verizon today.  The employee checked the IMEI and all was clear.

verizon,3di154,Taizek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:22:27 2015 UTC,"also, I bought my phone at the Apple Store and not T-Mobile, so maybe they differentiate between the two. My guess would be that."
verizon,3di154,breakingcustoms,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:22:13 2015 UTC,"Interesting. You're the first person I've encountered with an iPhone for a different carrier that seems to be on the Verizon whitelist. I'm curious:   Just to check: Apple Retail Store (not the Online Store), right? If you purchased your iPhone at the Apple Retail Store, did you request to use an existing T-Mobile SIM (if you had one) or did you use the preinstalled T-Mobile SIM? How did you pay for the phone? Full price up front? Installment plan?"
verizon,3di154,Taizek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:01:59 2015 UTC,"Actually I bought it online. When you buy T-Mobile online (or at least this is how it was at launch) it doesn't even ask for your account information but it does come with a new T-Mobile SIM. I was actually an AT&T user at the time but just didn't want a contract.   Yes I paid 100% up front. My guess is that the IMEI was clean from the start. I believe that phones purchased from T-Mobile on installment are not unlocked until after a month and only if you ask them. For that reason, I'm guessing they're not unlocked at the store. Is it possible that Verizon is accessing Apple's IMEI database to see if a phone is clean or not? This could also explain why floor models at Apple Retail are not white listed."
verizon,3di154,breakingcustoms,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:00:40 2015 UTC,"Actually I bought it online.   The Apple Online Store lets you buy an iPhone for T-Mobile only at full price up front. (If you want an equipment installment plan, you need to go to an Apple Retail Store, or of course, a T-Mobile Store or the T-Mobile Web site.) The SIM-free Model A1586 and A1524 support more networks than the Model A1549 and A1522, so why would anyone willing to pay full price up front not purchase the SIM-free Model A1586 or A1524?   You want to activate a new line of service with T-Mobile and don't know about/want to deal with SIM cards. You purchased your iPhone 6 or 6 Plus before January 2015, when Apple started selling the SIM-free Model A1586 and A1524.   You had the second (better) reason.   Yes I paid 100% up front. My guess is that the IMEI was clean from the start. I believe that phones purchased from T-Mobile on installment are not unlocked until after a month and only if you ask them. For that reason, I'm guessing they're not unlocked at the store. Is it possible that Verizon is accessing Apple's IMEI database to see if a phone is clean or not? This could also explain why floor models at Apple Retail are not white listed.    Anyone who purchased an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus for T-Mobile from the Apple Online Store clearly paid off the device (because it's the only option from the Online Store), so Apple may have convinced Verizon to whitelist those specific devices. However, of all the devices I've tested, with the exception of the Nexus 6, Verizon hasn't whitelisted compatible devices (whether fully paid or not) for other carriers. (As I noted in the original post, a floor model Nexus 6 at a T-Mobile Store I visited passed the test on the Activate Existing Device page, so I think Verizon blacklists a device only if the owner fails to pay off the device or reports it as lost/stolen.) Whitelisting devices for T-Mobile specifically would be an unusual exception for Verizon. I really don't want to spend a lot of my money on this, but I'll keep looking for other people who purchased an iPhone for T-Mobile from the Apple Online Store to corroborate.  P.S. I just updated the original post because I forgot:   The iPad Air (Model A1475) and iPad mini 2 (Model A1490) have the same network compatibility as the iPad mini 3. The iPad with Retina display, 4th generation (Model A1460) and iPad mini (Model A1455) support all four national carriers (but only on LTE bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25).   I'll try to find some to test."
verizon,3di154,xxile,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:26:09 2015 UTC,So will the AT&T iPhones work on all VZW bands if you pop an already activated Verizon SIM into them?
verizon,3di154,breakingcustoms,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:14:47 2015 UTC,"They will. They did not open up the whitelist like the Nexus 6. I saw one on an account a few weeks ago. It comes up as ""Non-VZW"" device"
verizon,3di154,agrips1,2,Thu Jul 16 13:20:53 2015 UTC,And that means they don't get the month to month discount?
verizon,3di154,agrips1,2,Thu Jul 16 14:37:55 2015 UTC,"This is correct. If they aren't whitelisted, there is no M2M discount"
verizon,3di154,agrips1,0,Thu Jul 16 15:21:00 2015 UTC,Is it pretty common to abbreviate month-to-month with M2M? I'd previously only seen M2M mean machine-to-machine.
verizon,3di154,celestisdiabolus,2,Thu Jul 16 16:39:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, I've seen machine to machine. Store channels very rarely see that, so when we see M2M, we always think month to month"
verizon,3djhnu,ShadowEdge6,2,Thu Jul 16 19:44:12 2015 UTC,Probably a sim card issue. Get a new one. It will not hurt your unlimited data.
verizon,3djhnu,maryhadalittlefist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:04:17 2015 UTC,You might as well try a new SIM card(if you don't have unlimited data).

verizon,3djhnu,AntAPD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:19:01 2015 UTC,Ouch. I do have unlimited data. I am going to assume if I try a new sim card I might lose the unlimited?

verizon,3djhnu,AntAPD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:19:16 2015 UTC,So it could possibly be the sim card?
verizon,3djhnu,AntAPD,3,Thu Jul 16 20:30:39 2015 UTC,Definitely possible
verizon,3djhnu,blaziecat1103,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:42:49 2015 UTC,Yes
verizon,3djhnu,maryhadalittlefist,0,Fri Jul 17 01:13:44 2015 UTC,The issue with changing SIM cards on an UDP is that apparently Verizon's system doesn't allow representatives to choose your UDP when they're transferring your service. Can you try your existing SIM in another phone?
verizon,3djhnu,breakingcustoms,2,Thu Jul 16 20:19:01 2015 UTC,"When you say ""apparently,"" I'm going to assume you don't use these systems daily like many of us in this sub do.   I can tell you from personal experience that assigning a different sim card to his line (sim only change) will not disturb his unlimited data."
verizon,3diws1,OCDS,2,Thu Jul 16 17:13:34 2015 UTC,"Ok so I just got of the phone with a ""customer care"" rep that was very helpful. He said that it was no longer possible to do an AOL, and keep UDP, even with business accounts. However, he said that if my son received a discount through his employer, that it could be applied to a sub-account(I have multiple sub-accounts). He said I could call in and simply provide the following: employee ID#, employer name, and the name of the discount, even if the account wasn't under his name. He also made me aware of the fact, that enrolling in ""equipment protection"" can also remove UDP. Hope this helps someone!"
verizon,3diws1,TheOnlyProfelec,4,Thu Jul 16 21:58:01 2015 UTC,"Yes and No. Just a reminder before I explain to TAKE THIS AT YOUR OWN DAMN RISK.   If you are on a plan that already has a UDP you can transfer another one and it will stay good.   Or, you can open a business account (will probably require a nice down payment, but could be worth it if you 'need' unlimited data). When you transfer to business it won't fall off.   Both of these work, I've seen them work, and people post of them working. BUT, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO FIND A REP THAT WILL DO IT. Just because it doesn't fall off when doing it one of those two ways, doesn't mean the person doing it won't change it on you."
verizon,3diws1,maryhadalittlefist,0,Thu Jul 16 17:56:42 2015 UTC,"As of November 14th 2014, Verizon no longer approves Inactive Pricing Requests in cases that involve an Assumption of Liability.  Your response was correct, BEFORE NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR. But it no longer works the same."
verizon,3diws1,TheOnlyProfelec,2,Thu Jul 16 18:14:49 2015 UTC,"I've had this talk with many people on this sub. I know when they changed it. But just like how you can get a contract and keep unlimited, you can AOL and keep unlimited. Just certain ways it has to be done.   There's a discussion on Howards forum (I think) about it. If you have an account with UDP already and AOL onto that account, the UDP won't fall off. And business accounts can AOL without a change too. Now if I were to AOL onto a new account or a personal account without UDP already, then it would fall off."
verizon,3diws1,maryhadalittlefist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:21:12 2015 UTC,So the answer is almost always no. Is that what you're saying?
verizon,3diws1,TheOnlyProfelec,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:29:56 2015 UTC,Just situational. And how much you really want it bad enough to open a business account
verizon,3diws1,omg_hi2doge,2,Thu Jul 16 18:36:25 2015 UTC,"His response is correct AFTER the Nov 14 2014 date.  Before his response, anyone can AOL a UDP line, regardless of previously owning a UDP in an account or having a business account."
verizon,3diws1,maryhadalittlefist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:46:11 2015 UTC,"According to Verizon's internal system, the answer is no."
verizon,3diws1,AntAPD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:46:03 2015 UTC,"My situation is the following...currently have two 4G LTE phones on a mobile-to-mobile nationwide FamShare. Both lines have UDP. Are you saying its better for me to let my son take over that account, or for him to open a new one and transfer? He receives a discount through his employer, so this is the reason for the AOL."
verizon,3diws1,duane534,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:59:25 2015 UTC,Easier answer. Does his employer give him a work email?  Verizon wireless.com/discounts. Register it for YOUR account but register it with HIS work email. Did this a bunch of times for friends  End up with your account with his discount
verizon,3diws1,TheOnlyProfelec,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:24:53 2015 UTC,No email. 17% off of a $200 bill seems worth it.

Mine called me within 12 hours, but they could take up to 72.  If you've made it past the first round all you can really do is sit tight and know that you're halfway there.  Hardest part is waiting to see if you get the position because they won't close out and make a choice until all candidates have been interviewed.  Make of point of learning the most popular smart accessories (what they do, specs, what OS, who would be a good fit for it) and the flagship phones as well as who would be a candidate for those phones.

I was under contract, and a student at the time, so I wasn't trying to pay any cancellation fee.  As soon as my contract was up, I called to terminate my service, and I was basically given the same information that you were over and over and over again.  ""Don't worry Fios is coming soon,"" but they would never give me a timeline and I had already suffered through two years of dial up speed internet.  They tried their best to just keep me on the phone and offer me a bunch of nonsense, but I finally was able to cancel.

verizon,3dgvle,ofBeautyAndRage,7,Thu Jul 16 04:26:30 2015 UTC,"That's not true, you can purchase the phone from a third party as long as it's Verizon compatible. If you get it from Apple, just specify that you want to use it on Verizon's network."

verizon,3dgvle,ignition386,2,Thu Jul 16 12:28:33 2015 UTC,"As long as it's Verizon compatible (has the CDMA radios for 1x/3G), and as long as the SIM cards are the correct size, yes. If not the correct size, use a SIM cutter/scissors to cut it down to size, or use an adapter if you need to move up a size.  I recently used a SIM cutter to cut my full-sized SIM (which I've had since Verizon launched their first LTE phone, the Thunderbolt) down to nanoSIM size + a microSIM adapter so that I could use it in a Verizon LG G2 I bought new from ebay a couple of months back.  Rooted, Rommed, and running fine on Verizon!  If you don't want to do any cutting/use an adapter, you can take your new phone to a Verizon store and request a SIM of the correct size.  Corporate stores usually do it for free."
verizon,3dgvle,ofBeautyAndRage,0,Thu Jul 16 12:46:26 2015 UTC,"Yes absolutely you can do that if the sim is pre activated you wont have any issues just switch it over and your good, iphones only dont work if you try to setup a new iphone that is GSM only because Verizon is CDMA but to tell you the truth all iPhone 6 and 6 Plus that you buy from Verizon are already factory unlocked anyway. But if you have a GSM only iphone 6 it will work on Verizon if you have a pre existing sim for Verizon which is weird they just really want you to buy the phone from them but anyway all other phones are fine on Verizon as long as its not prepaid then you have to have it on prepaid for 6 months before post paid."
verizon,3dg1pk,athaemik,2,Thu Jul 16 00:01:26 2015 UTC,"Multiple things at play. I can give some advice.  1) If your sister is an authorized user on your account, then she is authorized to make any changes, including an alternative upgrade.   2) If she used your upgrade and put the new device on her line (which is sounds like she did) your UDP is good. As long as the new equipment doesn't go onto your line during the upgrade process  3) If you want a new phone and upgrade her line, you can keep unlimited. You have to upgrade her line and program the phone. This will disconnect her phone. Then you can swap the sim cards between devices or process a device change through myVerizon.   One thing. If you process an upgrade on a different line, that line will also have a 2 year data contract. So you will be required to have data on that line. If it's a smartphone, no problem. If it's a basic line, it's going to cost more, as you will be required to have data."
verizon,3dg1pk,kayle12,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:55:20 2015 UTC,"So I would upgrade her phone, then activate it as if she were using it. Then, once it was active on her line, i would transfer it over to my line, and transfer her sim back to her old phone and activate it? Thank you!"
verizon,3dg1pk,kayle12,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:17:14 2015 UTC,Sorry I should have explained that better. Yes upgrade her line as if she was using it. Then process a device only change and put her back on her older phone. Then process a device only change on your line for the new phone.  You can also do the same process and just move sim cards. They will activate automatically as long as they are the same size sim card. That's the quickest way.
verizon,3dg1pk,RedVsBlue209,2,Thu Jul 16 01:50:39 2015 UTC,If your phone isn't upgraded then your plan shouldn't change. At least that's how it worked about 2 years ago. I used my dad's UDP upgrade for my phone and he still has his UDP.

Which is 34.99, paired with 2GB of data is 34.99+30.00=64.99. That doesn't include any texting. Or if you really don't talk at all, the lowest is $15/30 minutes.

You can also qualify for the MORE Everything plan with a reduced smartphone line access fee due to being out of contract.   For example: 6GB $70 + $15 for smartphone line access. Total $85.  If you have a 6GB or higher plan, your smartphone line access is $15. If you have 4GB or under it's $25. You might check both of those before looking at a loyalty plan."

The screen is definitely inferior than the turbo but thats probably obvious considering 720p vs 1440p.

In addition, take your driver's license and social security card with you. If Verizon's systems ping your ss# and find no history, they will require proof of your existence. Just an anti fraud step.

And, the type/cost of phone has never been relevant to determining security deposit on 2-yr contract.

verizon,3da5al,FireNerd,2,Tue Jul 14 18:13:56 2015 UTC,"1) any line with a contract-end date later than 1/1/14 is not eligible for the 4 month early upgrade. You get 7 days early only. For years, Verizon allowed 4 month early upgrades. When Verizon realized that the edge program is more profitable, they began shutting down offers that pushed people to new 2-yr contracts.  2) If you have a line eligible for upgrade, and then you use that upgrade eligibility to get a phone on a different line, the line that was eligible will be extended for 2 years on contract, or that eligible line will have an edge agreement on it. So at that point if you cancel it, you will get charged either an early termination fee or the remaining balance on that edge agreement."

No notes needed for a suggestion like this because no guarantees were given.  The eligibility is what it is. No one can change it because it is controlled systematically. No amount of calls to customer care or suggestions that they check the notes on the account will change what the system allows us to offer you.  Also, in almost every case, the early edge upgrade requires you to turn your phone in to Verizon in good working condition. This means no physical or water damage, with all buttons working properly. You say in your post that your phone is not working and beat up, so you may not be able to turn that phone in without paying a fee. So unless you're one of the lucky ones who is allowed to do early edge WITHOUT needing to turn in your phone, you will be charged as high as $299 if you do early edge but do not turn in that phone in working condition.  Also, it appears that the 6 month early edge eligibility seems to follow customers' billing cycles. If you have an upcoming billing cycle, pay your bill up to date, wait until the new billing clicks over, and check for eligibility again. I've had a lot of customers get early edge emails immediately after their billing cycle started over.  Edit: your long term account with Verizon is not going to change what options Verizon gives you. Every customer uses this line: "" I've been a customer for 653467 years, why can't I.... "" the money you paid for Verizon service was for that service that has past. You were not investing that money into future returns. I've been eating cheeseburgers from McDonald's for 20 years. I've never thought i deserved a free one just because I've been a long term customer of theirs."

On a ME 15GB plan, someone with a basic phone has zero impact on anything, anywhere, ever, in regards to Verizon's network.  There is no reasonably possible way Verizon can make a profit of any kind from this person, so they charge more.  A smartphone user, on the other hand, actually uses data, and will gladly pay for it.  Contrary to popular belief, Verizon doesn't want you to get overages.  They want you to be happy with your data usage.  Sure they want you to use more, and that's why they make it more enticing to use more, because the more you use, the more you'll buy.  This is why tablets and jetpacks are a big deal, more data devices is more data usage.  Meanwhile, that basic phone isn't using enough data to even register on MyVerizon.  In many cases, Verizon is actually losing money on basic lines, but they keep them alive to avoid the PR nightmare of doing what Sprint has done in the past and simply mass-cancelling thousands of lines at a time.  Plus it helps them say, ""We have X number of active lines!""  It's not even remotely strange why Verizon would charge more for a basic line than a smartphone.  Maintaining the average basic line costs more than maintaining the average smartphone line.  It only makes sense they'd charge more."

verizon,3d6l3g,duane534,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:58:02 2015 UTC,"No, that's not even remotely why.  The $15 line access for a smartphone can't subsidize a phone because it doesn't  In order to get it, you have to buy the phone outright.  If subsidizing the phone had anything to do with the equation, a similar option would be there for basic phones.  There's just no reason to subsidize a basic phone when the full retail price is $50.  It has to do with what the average basic phone earns Verizon based on it's usage, vs what the average smartphone earns Verizon based on it's usage.  Basic phones don't earn anything at all.  The line cost incentive exists purely to get people to switch to a smartphone, and has nothing at all to do with the cost of the device itself."
verizon,3d6l3g,AngrySmapdi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:04:11 2015 UTC,"Correlation doesn't always mean causation, but a $40 line gets a subsidized phone. A $15 line doesn't. (There should be an OOC discount for basics, though.)"
verizon,3d6l3g,duane534,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:13:07 2015 UTC,"No.  Incorrect.  You think the cost of the line determines what gets a subsidized phone, but you have it backwards.  It's not that a $40 line gets a subsidized phone, it's that a subsidized phone gets a $40 line.  The only way to get the discount, whether it's $15 or $25, is if you don't have a subsidized phone.  It's not the status of the line that determines your phone price, it's the status of your phone price that determines the line cost.  That's why basic phones don't get a discounted line cost, because the phone price is relatively trivial."

When Share Everything began, a smartphone was $40, basic phone $30. Then eventually, Verizon moved basic phone lines to $20, then later allowed smartphone to go to $15 when out of contract. If you think about it, the total cost of a smartphone is it's line charge ($40 or $15) plus that's line's share of the data plan cost. So a smartphone line, even out of contract, is going to generate more revenue than a basic phone line on 99.9% of accounts."

Stop waiting and call immediately.  2) explain to them that it wasn't you who placed this call. Ask for the charges to be waived. If you are nice, you may get it waived.

BTW, for this call to happen, international dialing had to already be enabled for your line. If this isn't something you need, turn it off to prevent this from happening in the future.  Since messing up international stuff can cost a lot of money, you have to talk to a vzw rep to change it. Also, in cases like this in order to be a benefit to you, a plan change has to be done retroactively, and that isn't something you can do yourself online.  When talking to the vzw rep, you will have to understand that they can only make changes retroactive to the beginning of the current bill cycle, so if your cycle has already ended, it will be a much different process."

On a standard voice line, the free, included call forwarding service is always listed as a $0 feature. On a tablet line, that feature not only isn't added automatically, but also the system will not allow me to add the feature. This means that the Verizon system is not set up to do what you're asking.   Check into Google voice. It'll probably do what you are trying to do. Gives you a voice number that you can forward- even forward calls to multiple devices and whichever answers first gets the call. Pretty cool."

As long as you keep your line active, you can continue making the monthly EDGE payments.   Do I get to keep the g3 (to sell off)?   Yes, although I would recommend paying off 100% of the phone before selling it off.    EDGE-up at 75% is probably a ripoff (depending on phone).  You're basically saying that you'd ""sell"" the phone back to Verizon @ 25% of the value left.  Would it be easier to just pay off the rest of that 25%, then sell it on the market (swappa.com) for more?  If so, go for it!"
verizon,3czh4q,BKC501,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:59:53 2015 UTC,if you edge up you still need to trade in the G3 since that is what the system will ask for regardless of which phone is on there currently. The edge payments will remain the same unless a new edge agreement is made.

I.e. $15 line access for each smartphone on the account if you have a total of 6GB or more shared data. $25 line access for each smartphone if you have less than 6GB of data on the account.

With a new two year contract, you have the initial phone payment to worry about, plus the one time $40 upgrade fee on your next bill, and the higher line access fee of $40. On Edge it's just the line access fee, phone payment, and data package."
verizon,3cw61j,TheOnlyProfelec,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:26:27 2015 UTC,"It's weird and involved, but the end point is you pay for your data, then 15 per line on top of that. If you buy a new phone on edge, then the monthly payment for that phone goes on top of the 15."

Of course you can get a used postpaid version.  The 2nd Gen Moto E LTE is very similar to the 1st Gen Moto G.  Has LTE (== has SIM slot), and even though it falls under the same conditions (6 months on prepaid before 'official' postpaid usage), you can actually just drop in your MicroSIM and it'll work no problem!  It regularly goes on sale for $50 (or less), which is a steal for what it is.  Really surprised you're having issues with the LG G2.  Although, I do know that the 1st Android 5.0 update caused a lot of issues (battery/performance).  I heard the later update (5.0.2? 5.1?) fixed a lot of that.    As far as using the G2, you pretty much 'stop' using the back buttons (relying on the screen UI for volume control), and using the knock-on feature (best thing ever!  wish all phones had this!) for turning the phone on/off."
verizon,3cuew2,SilverIdaten,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:42:04 2015 UTC,"I'm going to second the suggestions here for Moto E. I've played around with one a few times and it's a really cool little device. You can get it for cheap brand new and it has Lollipop out of the box, 5.1 on the way, plus an SD slot. Can't go wrong. So long as you buy the phone outright and pop your SIM in before you turn it on, you won't have to worry about that prepaid for six month bullshit.  Galaxy Core Prime full retail is just under $200 too. Decent little phone for a budget. No Lollipop, though.  I'd pick the Moto E, honestly. You have the SD slot so the 8 GB storage isn't too bad, and it's not THAT small."
verizon,3cuew2,SilverIdaten,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:58:53 2015 UTC,"I tried this option but I can't download all of my apps.

Not sure if I'm missing something."
verizon,3cuew2,Mr_T0ad,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:10:37 2015 UTC,"Some apps aren't programmed to be able to run from an SD card, it's frankly up to the developer. You should be able to send whatever apps are capable to go to the card from the Applications menu under Settings, there should be a tab for the SD card.  If they're already on there then the only think I could think of is possibly looking at trimming a few apps. The only thing that sucks about the Moto E is its low onboard storage."

All Verizon phones that support LTE are unlocked out of the box, so you're good on that front.   Are you buying this phone in the US or in the Philippines? If you're buying the phone in the US, you should get the AT&T model from somewhere other than an AT&T store, get it unlocked for free(you have to do this, otherwise you will have a phone that's still locked to AT&T and useless overseas), and profit. With an unlocked AT&T model, you'll get 3G and LTE service on both Smart and Globe, as well as in most of the rest of the world. I don't remember if Samsung is still doing their region locking bullshit or not, so just to be safe, insert an American carrier's SIM card and make a call that's at least 5 minutes long after you get the phone carrier-unlocked. That will void the region lock and let you use it in the Philippines.  If you're buying the phone in the Philippines, chances are that if there's a local merchant selling the Galaxy S6 Edge, they'll be selling the SM-G925F international unlocked model or the SM-G920I Asia-Pacific unlocked model Galaxy S6 Edge. Both will work fine, with 3G and LTE service on both Smart and Globe. I don't know about local merchants or pricing."

verizon,3clrb2,reductase,2,Thu Jul 9 01:35:12 2015 UTC,Looks up verizon unlimited data on ebay you will see it for around 100$ it works well i also recently bought a new AT&T UDP as a backup from a friend since coverage strength varys from place to place so now i have a backup plan.
verizon,3clc7o,agrips1,9,Wed Jul 8 20:19:26 2015 UTC,"It amazes me that some people that work in the stores have been under the same system for so long that now they literally have no idea what they are talking about. Of course you can use A1586 on Verizon. I have an A1524 (unlocked 6 Plus) that I've used on Verizon.  The problem is getting the active Verizon SIM. This could be why some of them tell you it can't be activated, the system will literally not allow the IMEI. This is why the Nexus 6 was such a pain. I've heard that when Verizon opened up their database to include all Nexus 6s, it also started opening up to iPhone 6s too. As far as I know, the iPhone 6 and the Nexus 6 are the only two phones right now capable of running on all four major U.S. networks. You may be able to get your IMEI inputted now. If not, you'll just have to go through a dummy phone first.  Here's my proof: http://imgur.com/fyQjGQ8  EDIT - By the way, My Verizon even shows it as an iPhone 6 Plus, not a 'Non-VZW Device'. I think the database has been updated now, you can probably just do it the normal way.  And yes, I need to charge my phone!"
verizon,3clc7o,SilverIdaten,2,Wed Jul 8 22:02:34 2015 UTC,When did you start using an unlocked iPhone 6 Plus on Verizon (with a preactivated SIM)? Did Verizon ever drop the $15/25 month-to-month discount even though you brought your own device?  Verizon may still be denying activation/discounts for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices from other carriers.
verizon,3clc7o,fanoffanless,2,Wed Jul 8 22:27:06 2015 UTC,"I primarily use the phone on another carrier, so I have no idea. I bought the phone with the intent on using it on T-Mobile. I don't regularly use it on Verizon, I'll pop in the SIM every once in awhile for the hell of it. I do know that you can't get the discount when it says 'Non-VZW Device', and since it popped on My Verizon as an iPhone 6 Plus and not a Non-VZW Device, I honestly don't see why not.  EDIT - I input my IMEI on their website to check compatibility, and it shows as compatible. I don't see why it wouldn't work."

verizon,3cn1l2,ofBeautyAndRage,0,Thu Jul 9 11:47:01 2015 UTC,Lol id like to see your reaction when they take unlimited away it wont be around much longer soon they will force everyone off it im sure.

verizon,3cn1l2,ofBeautyAndRage,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:03:06 2015 UTC,"well, they can either have some of my money, or none of my money, that's their choice.  I'm not a heavy user, most months i don't go over 3GB, but when i'm on vacation i've hit 15GB.  Usually i only use large ammounts of data late at night, and trust me, if i can pull 60Mbps, their network isn't congested enough to care about me.  They'll lose $65 a month from me if they get rid of unlimited.  I just hit my 15 year mark, and i always pay on time.  I've actually been with them longer, but they weren't verizon when i signed up... GTE wireless i believe."
verizon,3cn1l2,sandmyth,3,Thu Jul 9 12:23:17 2015 UTC,In reality they are losing more money if you keep UDP because data costs money alot of it sooo the smart move would be to get rid of it
verizon,3cn1l2,ofBeautyAndRage,-1,Thu Jul 9 12:34:26 2015 UTC,"That's not how businesses work.  They know i have unlimited, and they get $65 a month from me.  If they were to get rid of unlimited they'd loose a certain percent of their unlimited users.  They have to decide if getting rid of unlimited data and losing a certain % of those customers would be worth the gains for switching those customers to a pay by the GB data plan.  Right now, at least in my area, there's plenty of bandwidth to go around, verizon is faster than the cable company.  No reason to loose revenue from me when their network can support me."
verizon,3cn1l2,sandmyth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:44:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's exactly how businesses work.  Regardless of bandwidth usage, if they can draw 95% of their users in the area, all of whom use less than 3GB per line/month into a ME plan,  but the remaining 5% is using 100+GB per month, they will do everything in their power to obliterate that last 5%, because it's that 5% that is using the vast majority of their network.  By wiping out that 5%, they gain a ridiculously huge amount of bandwidth usage that they no longer need to upgrade because it is more than enough to support the rest of their customers in the area.  They'd rather get $50/month from 1000 people than $65 from 15 by far.  This is what the ""unlimited"" population doesn't understand.  I'm all for what you have.  Fight the system forever, never give it up.  If you use it, never lose it.  What you don't understand is that you are, comparatively, a gigantic drain financially.  For every single customer that uses 50GB a month on an unlimited plan, that's 20 ""average"" customers they could have instead.  I'm sorry, but that's absolutely how businesses work."

verizon,3cjoqi,darkenspirit,2,Wed Jul 8 13:04:06 2015 UTC,"There's a comment on the link you've posted that fairly well describes the situation.  Instead of a modem, FiOS customers have an optical network terminal (ONT) somewhere in or around their home.  This serves a similar purpose as the cable modem, in that it takes the multipurpose fiber-optic connection from Verizon and converts it into a signal that can be transmitted through your home's existing wiring.  ONTs for FiOS Internet-only customers have (used to, at least, may have changed now, or may only be on request) a standard RJ-45 (looks like a phone cable but wider) Ethernet port that could be connected to a typical router, similar to the one on the back of a cable modem.  However, if you have Internet and TV service, the ONT will likely combine the signal for TV and Internet into a single coaxial connection, using a protocol called MOCA.  If you want to use your own router, it will need to have a coaxial connector for the WAN port instead of RJ-45, and include the appropriate technology to separate the TV and Internet signals from MOCA.  Alternately, you can get a bridge that just separates the network signal from MOCA and provides an RJ-45 connection.  The reason most people rent or purchase a Verizon-branded router is that there aren't a lot of  (any?) retail-available routers (or bridges) that support this technology.  Verizon is the only one currently using this technology, so there's not much incentive for anyone to make a router that isn't custom configured for their service, package it for retail, distribute it through wholesalers, etc.  That said, there have been discussions on DSLReports.com about this, and there are some very technical folks who discuss a variety of hardware configurations."

verizon,3cjoqi,AFuckingAtodaso,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:50:52 2015 UTC,"Fios rep with 5+ years experience.  the reason you need to use a fios router is because our set top boxes retrieve the channel guide and on demand info via our routers. you can absolutely run your own router and modem along side ours set up directly from the ONT like u/ericjay mentioned, or you can run it off of our router.  i would recommend getting the fios gateway router. it's 9.99 opposed to the 7.99 for the basic fios router, but fios guarantees a range of 325 feet with the gateway. Also i would like to point out that you can buy it for 199.99, so if you're signing a 2yr contract it might be finanically smarter to just buy it outright.  edit. verizon does not castrate their routers. 95% of our equipment is rented out, so i'm sure there are still routers our there that are out of date and are using older firmware, but if you feel like there is an issue come in store with your equipment and we'll swap it out for you."

verizon,3chvct,Taizek,2,Tue Jul 14 01:20:27 2015 UTC,"From what I vaguely recall from business law, I think the fact is that VZW just has the right to charge that much.  Basically, VZW buys the phone from Google, puts their own software in it, makes it compatible with their network, and then sells it at a markup.  Why is this legal?  Because you, the consumer, have the right to neither purchase our Nexus 6, nor become a Verizon customer."
verizon,3chvct,KLance23,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:22:04 2015 UTC,"I hear you on your last statement.  I declined to pay for it.  Even though I want the phone.  I just won't pay an additional $100 for it.  I wasn't questioning it's legality.  More it's morality.  In VZW's defense, I had previously looked at retailers and not other carriers.  T-mobile is selling it for their network at $699.  So VZW isn't alone.  VZW is the only game in town for me anyway if I want reliable coverage.  But I already pay a premium for my plan and therefor that coverage.  I don't need to be paying extra for my phone too."
verizon,3chvct,maryhadalittlefist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:34:39 2015 UTC,No idea what plan you are on but you may be able to get a $15/$25 monthly discount once you purchase the nexus
verizon,3chvct,Taizek,0,Wed Jul 8 02:54:24 2015 UTC,"To Verizon's credit, when I finished paying off my edge agreement yesterday, they didn't yank out the discounts from underneath me.  I really thought they would.  You are correct.  You get the same discount even if you own the phone outright.  The only issue is if it's a device they don't support.  Then they let you connect, but they take away the discount."
verizon,3chvct,purplemountain01,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:32:48 2015 UTC,"Can you provide any proof that a line with a ""non-vzw device"" is not eligible for the $15/$25 smartphone month-to-month discounts?"
verizon,3chvct,purplemountain01,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:03:47 2015 UTC,"I can't provide direct evidence, no.  This assertion is based on the dozens of stories I found online from Verizon customers who purchased their Nexus 6 devices from Motorola, Google or retailers other than Verizon."
verizon,3chvct,mrshoppingcart,0,Sat Jul 11 14:12:14 2015 UTC,"Well, markups exist because businesses exist to make money.  Just the way it is!    However, the IMEI of the Google Nexus 6's have been added to the VZW database for activation, so you're all good to go to purchase the $499 one without any penalty.  Worst case scenario, we just activate a VZW SIM card and pop it into the phone that way.  Either way, you're covered."
verizon,3chvct,mrshoppingcart,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"That's what the rep in store told me... that they would activate it.  But the online rep told me they wouldn't.  And the internet is filled with horror stories of people who bought nexus 6's and cant activate with Verizon, or... activated by switching sims with a different phone and then losing their $25 / month access discount and not being able to make plan changes.  So I no longer know what to do.  Your voice is just one of many conflicting voices.  As for your comment about making money.  Sure!  I don't begrudge Verizon making money!  I sure like to make money!  But I expect them to make their money on their plans and to leave the phones alone, since it doesn't cost them any more to support me on a Nexus than a Samsung S5 or whatever.  Maybe they don't have to.  But since it's my wallet, it is at least a little bit about what I want."
verizon,3chvct,mrshoppingcart,2,Wed Jul 8 01:48:22 2015 UTC,Why the hell would you want a Verizon branded phone? If price is an issue why not by from Google or Motorola? All Nexus 6's support every carrier in the US. They are all unlocked except AT&T AFAIK.
verizon,3chvct,maryhadalittlefist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:42:11 2015 UTC,"If you would read my other comments, you would realize that I don't want a Verizon branded phone.  I hate Verizon.  They are soulless and disgusting purveyors of greed.  Remember years ago when they use to put a little dot in the battery compartment of your phone that would supposedly change color if your phone got wet?  When you needed service on your phone under warranty, they would always open the back... and no matter what, even if you lived in the desert, the dot had always changed color so they always got to reject your claim and charge you through the nose?  I've never forgiven them for that.  And they've done a lot worse to me since then.  Remember when they updated the software of all their phones to disable bluetooth or USB file transfers so you couldn't transfer your own music to the phone and instead had to buy it from VZW?  That was around the same time as the dot.  Remember when they tried to charge everybody an extra $2 for the privilege of making a manual online payment?  That was what, 2 years ago?  But I digress;  In regards to the Nexus 6 on Verizon's Network, I'm afraid I'm stuck with their branded version because of stories like this:  http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/03/28/shocker-even-after-launching-the-nexus-6-verizon-still-wont-officially-activate-one-that-wasnt-purchased-from-the-carrier/  It's not that old of a story.  And since when you ask multiple Verizon employees, they can't keep their stories straight, I have no confidence I'll be able to pull off a Motorola purchased phone on the Verizon network.  That is what I'd very much like to do.  Or... Verizon could just charge a reasonable price and be a reasonable corporate citizen.  I'm a dreamer."
verizon,3chvct,maryhadalittlefist,3,Wed Jul 8 02:58:05 2015 UTC,I'm a former Verizon customer. Finally I meet someone on this sub who hates them too lol. I know as of very recent within the past month or two Verizon has started to activate non VZ Nexus devices.  This issue was also brought to the FCC attention too by someone in this sub.   Edit: here's the FCC complaint
verizon,3chvct,AngrySmapdi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:20:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for your feedback.  I'm more and more inclined to give it a shot.  Motorola appears to offer a 14 day return if things look fishy once I try to activate it.
verizon,3ch1gj,BeigiBlork,2,Tue Jul 7 21:11:10 2015 UTC,"You may need to keep talking to Verizon about this. If it's causing problems and you can present proof, Verizon should be able to disable the extender remotely.  Is the native tower signal bad enough to warrant using an extender?"
verizon,3ch1gj,Smith6612,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:52:05 2015 UTC,The tower signal strength is fine. I have gathered that the network extender has been installed for years. Perhaps when it was installed there was a problem. But now Verizon has good signal strength here.   Thanks for the response. This problem is pretty bothersome.
verizon,3ch1gj,believable_post,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:49:03 2015 UTC,Have four friends over and I'll make long calls on the extender. That way they won't be able to make calls. They will call in and have their numbers white listed do you can't use it?  Crappy situation :/ nor sure if that would actually work.
verizon,3ch1gj,caller-number-four,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:03:11 2015 UTC,The extender supports 10 calls at a time.  Plus one for emergency.

verizon,3ch1gj,maryhadalittlefist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:11:57 2015 UTC,"At the most basic level, Verizon is not concerned about individuals who have unusual circumstances. Verizon is so huge that if this guy leaves because of some unusual circumstances, it doesn't really hurt them. For this reason, they are not going to give him a network extender. It doesn't make good business sense to do so."

verizon,3cgs5z,jlgreen531,2,Tue Jul 7 20:06:31 2015 UTC,The discount is applied to the data package. You will get the discount either way. I would purchase the phone on edge. Interest free 24 month loan.

verizon,3cgs5z,rhynoplaz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:05:48 2015 UTC,"No idea why it's different, but the discount would definitely work the same in both cases. I've seen it every which way."
verizon,3cgs5z,skiutah1080,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:01:00 2015 UTC,"Except not only do you pay for the phone, but you don't get the line discount so if you look at what you pay for the phone over that 24 months, for something like an iphone 6 plus, take the $35/mo for the phone plus the $15/mo discount you won't be getting = $50/mo x 24 months = $1200 for a phone you could have purchased for $750+tax...  So not even close to free."
verizon,3cgs5z,Mr_T0ad,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:19:49 2015 UTC,You get the discount ($15 or $25) if you are on edge or if you bring your own compatible device.   http://www.verizonwireless.com/landingpages/more-everything/  The line access is $40 on 2 year contracts.
verizon,3cgs5z,duane534,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:27:04 2015 UTC,"No matter what you do, phone-wise, the sum total you pay Verizon will be the same amount. The question is, do you want to buy the phone as a lump sum. I wouldn't. Especially since your money could be earning interest, sitting in your account."
verizon,3cgs5z,AngrySmapdi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:54:49 2015 UTC,"Curious about how the interest works.  When you say, ""your account"" do you mean your Verizon account?"
verizon,3cgs5z,duane534,2,Wed Jul 8 05:32:14 2015 UTC,"I mean your bank account. If you pay $600 for the phone, upfront, you are not only spending $600, but you are sacrificing anything you could have gained with that $600 over the next two years. Bare minimum, it could sit in savings."
verizon,3cgs5z,AngrySmapdi,2,Wed Jul 8 05:46:35 2015 UTC,"Ah, in that case, I completely agree.  That's why Verizon promotes Edge so much.  There's almost never any reason to buy a phone full retail, when Edge is interest free financing on top of the monthly discount most people get."
verizon,3cgs5z,KLance23,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:22:26 2015 UTC,Yes you can purchase device on edge and pay off the remaining balance whenever you want.

verizon,3cg509,NoahThompson59767,2,Tue Jul 7 20:11:47 2015 UTC,Assuming your at all tech savvy.  Of course most of us in here could set that up.  But try telling your non-tech savvy relative to do that and its very clear they wont know what your talking about.  You also need to make sure your phone is setup for the same billing cycle etc and that what your phone thinks it used is the same as what vzw thinks was used ... overall vzw could make this easier and not charge overages etc .. they choose not to because they make more money that way.

I need to watch my children and teach them also.  I am among the tech savvy, I know many more people that are not and they have been hit by big overages.  The point still remains the only reason overages exist is to lock you into paying more for data you probably wont use, just so your not hit with a nasty high unexpected overage.  Its all a way to get more money out of your pocket."

verizon,3cg509,KLance23,0,Wed Jul 8 03:03:38 2015 UTC,"I am not calling Verizon the devil.  It is perfectly within their right to charge overage fees for using extra data, however, I don't think its a very moral thing to do.  Its not like the data suddenly costs more because you used an extra megabyte over your limit.  Ultimately you live in fear that your going to be hit with a big bill so you buy more data than you really need.  I do understand where your coming from, but I am asking you to think of it from a different view point.  Maybe locking in was the wrong choice of words, but the point is still this.  You usually pay for a bigger data bucket than you really need just to make sure your not going to have a large overage fee.  I do believe in paying your debts but at the same time it shouldn't be possible to be charged a bill as high at 42k as shown in this article.  http://www.androidauthority.com/verizon-wireless-sends-connecticut-woman-42k-bill-583648/ or take a look at this article on bill shock http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/31/cell-phone-bill-shock-study_n_6977338.html"

verizon,3cg509,duane534,2,Fri Jul 10 06:30:08 2015 UTC,"Lol, you sound like a typical spoiled customer.   A person can either choose to pay for more data to play it safe, take a more active role in managing their account, pay attention to the MULTIPLE emails and texts that are sent when approaching data limits, or not get a cell phone plan at all. These are 4 obvious and easy ways to avoid overages.   What's stupid about this is that at multiple points during a month, your phone will LITERALLY MAKE NOISE TO ALERT YOU OF A TEXT MESSAGE FROM VERIZON TELLING YOU ABOUT ISSUES WITH DATA! But it's still Verizon's fault? Lol  To expect that a company should give up a very lucrative business model because of your personal concept of morality is just plain absurd."

verizon,3cg509,Lemoooj,2,Tue Jul 7 21:26:22 2015 UTC,Verizon has a data analyzer android app. I need to verify but I think it is on the website to. It will give broad categories of how the data is used.
