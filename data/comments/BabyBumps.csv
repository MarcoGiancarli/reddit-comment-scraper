BabyBumps,3e0h3x,JusCallMeCyn,17,Tue Jul 21 00:32:04 2015 UTC,"My due date was supposed to be either the 21st or the 24th, my OB and I could never decide which one to go by. I was admitted for a scheduled induction at 6AM Friday morning, 07/17/15, while at 2cm, due to living so far away from the hospital.   At 7:30am started pitocin, which just gave me mild contractions until 4pm, and I only dilated .5 more cm, so we stopped the pitocin. Ate dinner, used the ball, got cervadil around 730pm, though we took it out at 1145pm because I was at 4cm and contracting regularly on my own! Around 6 AM I was at 6cm and the contractions were unbearable.   I tried the ball, hot shower, no relief in sight, until the nurse reminded me of the epidural. I opted for the epidural at 630am, and slept until probably noon, with the exception of being put back on the pitocin and getting a catheter around 830am, because the epi spread out my contractions.  It was amazing, I couldn't feel any of the ""moderate to severe"" contractions I was still getting, although I was SUPER itchy and warm. I was playing Hearthstone on my phone less than an hour before I told to push.   I pushed for about 15 minutes, tore three times, one of them needed two stitches, cord was wrapped around his neck, twice, but all in all he's okay and I wouldn't trade him for the world.

BabyBumps,3e15xk,nicqui,3,Tue Jul 21 05:26:38 2015 UTC,Hooray!  I had a Section with #2 after a traumatic Vaginal Birth with #1 and for me a VBAC was out of the question this go round.  I feel guilty but not enough to go through the trauma again.   So thrilled you had a positive experience this time.  Enjoy your new son.  I hope you heal quickly and everything goes smoothly!!  Congratulations!!!!
BabyBumps,3e15xk,bcgirl99,2,Tue Jul 21 05:14:25 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! It's amazing how practices for planned c-sections have improved over the past years. No mother-baby separation anymore, yeah!   I had an unplanned c-section with my first after failure to progress/descend. Because that happened at 41 weeks, I'm still a good candidate for VBAC at an earlier gestation. At the time I thought it was no worse than a planned c-section (baby at the breast within the hour, decent recovery), but now they've improved the planned c-sections so much they become tempting."
BabyBumps,3e15xk,syboor,2,Tue Jul 21 08:40:48 2015 UTC,So true! My hospital is very baby friendly and I got skin to skin immediately and got to start breastfeeding as soon as I was stitched up. It all felt very natural and calm.

BabyBumps,3e16jq,onwednesdaywewearpnk,38,Tue Jul 21 04:06:22 2015 UTC,Sleeping in whatever position I choose!  Not freaking out if my tummy doesn't move for a while!   Being able to get out of bed without rolling off.   Being able to sit on the floor then stand up without assistance.  The ability to bend over & pick stuff up from the floor.  Having a little baby in my house!!!!
BabyBumps,3e16jq,k2p2,5,Tue Jul 21 04:33:50 2015 UTC,This! Yes. Every single one you listed.

BabyBumps,3e16jq,SrslyYouToo,14,Tue Jul 21 04:39:08 2015 UTC,"I think that's why I found newborns so easy - my last two pregnancies were miserable, horrible experiences and I found screaming newborns easier than pregnancy. That being said, thus far,  number three has been worlds easier. Although I did kick off third trimester by puking dinner, so I reserve the right to change my mind."
BabyBumps,3e16jq,FL_Sunshine,5,Tue Jul 21 11:43:31 2015 UTC,Having any sensation in my hands other than burning or pins and needles and not needing ice-pack braces to sleep.   Being able to eat more than crackers without anti-nausea medication.   Being able to pick up my older kids without immediately contracting nearly every time.   Having there be some purpose to my 3am wake ups :)  10 more days. 10 more days...

BabyBumps,3e16jq,2ndstartotheright,9,Tue Jul 21 17:41:28 2015 UTC,"Being able to sleep more than 2 hour stretches. It might not happen for a while, but just the possibility of not waking up to pee or readjust because my hips hurt would be nice.   Being able to catch my toddler more easily.   Being  able to bend over to reach  something without feeling like I am swishing all my internal organs.   Being done waiting, every stronger BH I wonder if something is starting. Off course this usually happens at night when I don't want to wake my toddler for a false alarm.   Getting to see what baby looks like, and what his coloring will be."

BabyBumps,3e16jq,Tomkhagai,4,Tue Jul 21 07:50:15 2015 UTC,Wine. Wine. Oh and more wine.  My hips not feeling as though they are burning. No more swelling hands and feet. No more restless legs or leg cramps.  I'm just ready to feel normal again.

I had to clean it off the wall. Then I cried because I'm an adult and really thought I had my shit together better than that.
BabyBumps,3e0dl7,EveryOtherTime,17,Tue Jul 21 02:29:58 2015 UTC,I poked a potato and the texture made me throw up

BabyBumps,3e0dl7,soayherder,2,Tue Jul 21 00:53:07 2015 UTC,"Nearly threw up while driving, I add - a camper ahead of me had a tire blow out so that rubber hit my windshield, and the smell of the burning rubber... ugh, I can feel it in my throat a little."
BabyBumps,3e0dl7,soayherder,11,Tue Jul 21 02:16:07 2015 UTC,This has been me the past week. The post nasal drip constantly is making me run for the bathroom.

BabyBumps,3e0dl7,starbuckles,9,Tue Jul 21 04:51:17 2015 UTC,A couple months ago (~6 weeks along) I threw up in the shower because I THOUGHT ABOUT the coleslaw from the previous day's picnic.

I've puked in the shower--more than once.  I've puked because I thought about puking, got a nose bleed, and wound up peeing/pooing at the same time (thankfully I made it to the bathroom for that one) and then kept puking more every time I saw it, lol  Thankfully that seems to have slowed down some, but I did almost throw up this morning because my throat was dry :/"
BabyBumps,3e0dl7,babylina,6,Tue Jul 21 07:32:53 2015 UTC,I smelled someone's Chik-Fil-A and almost threw up on them. Had a full-blown crying fit cause there were no fresh chips and salsa in the store.

BabyBumps,3e0dl7,McSens,8,Tue Jul 21 18:47:48 2015 UTC,I opened the fridge and gagged. There is something that I cannot for the life of me pin point in there that is making this awful stench and every time I open the door...I want to heave.
BabyBumps,3e0dl7,cheekyuptowngirl,4,Tue Jul 21 01:56:51 2015 UTC,I made my husband clean out the fridge probably 3 times during my first trimester for the same reason.

BabyBumps,3dz2w5,Doc_Skydive,19,Mon Jul 20 22:43:53 2015 UTC,My theory on the stripes is that they think pregnant women WANT their baby bump emphasized so people don't think they're just fat. I wanted this for like...three weeks. I am so over the stripes.  But maybe vertical stripes look really weird over baby bumps? Not that we'll ever find out...
BabyBumps,3dz2w5,nierlisse,6,Mon Jul 20 21:20:13 2015 UTC,"Vertical stripes and most patterns look weird stretched over a bump, at least in my opinion. It's just too much optical at once."

Basically, I just dressed more casually when I was pregnant then I ever would have not-pregnant.  Other women at my office do the same.  I think there a bit of a ""ehh, she's pregnant, she gets a pass"" attitude.  Otherwise, I agree with you, it's practically impossible.  There isn't that much in the way of maternity business clothes out there, it's expensive, plus then you'd have to buy 2 entire new wardrobes (a casual one and a work one), to wear for like 5 months (such a waste of money!!).    Normally I wear: collared blouse/high waisted skirt/pants...that kind of thing.  Pregnant I wear:  Skinny black or beige pants with a sweater, or a dress with a cardigan,etc.  So definitely a level ""down"", but still work appropriate."

If I was feeling particularly fancy, I'd tie a ribbon or scarf above my bump so it looked like it was on purpose. I then wore yoga pants. Boom! Super comfy outfit, look mildly professional, and cheeaap."

BabyBumps,3dz2w5,1babybee,3,Mon Jul 20 20:33:56 2015 UTC,I like the men's shirt idea - room for bump AND boobs!

BabyBumps,3dz2w5,Yassssmaam,2,Mon Jul 20 19:32:11 2015 UTC,You can put a clip or a safety pin (on the inside so it doesn't show) in the back to gather the extra fabric. It pulls the whole thing together and it takes a second.
BabyBumps,3dz2w5,closetklepto,5,Tue Jul 21 00:08:27 2015 UTC,"I was planning on doing the retailor thing, maybe just add some darting and maybe round the bottom of the shirt, but then realized I was lazy...."

And you know what?  I will be wearing this to work.  I'm a teacher, but thankfully the school is pretty laid back about our attire (and from the t-shirts I've seen male teachers wear there, it's not bad at all).    Before I was all about silky blouses and skirts.  Now, if it fits and doesn't make me feel like a whale, I'm wearing it."
BabyBumps,3dz2w5,SrslyYouToo,2,Mon Jul 20 23:57:05 2015 UTC,"The biggest bullshit thing that I find about maternity clothes is that they only fit until you are 6-7 months pregnant!

BabyBumps,3dz2w5,noodletune,10,Tue Jul 21 02:11:39 2015 UTC,Jockey sells these things called skimmies. They are amazing. Not maternity but I bought a larger size and they cover my full belly. They are light weight and smooth. Great in the summer. Can't wear a skirt or dress without them.
BabyBumps,3dz2w5,missnewreddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:58:19 2015 UTC,"I have a couple pairs of those, and they are nice for wearing dresses or skirts. But sometimes, I'm just too hot and sweaty for the synthetic material they are made of.

BabyBumps,3dz2w5,sockalaunch,13,Tue Jul 21 01:02:32 2015 UTC,"Asos.com, pinkblushmaternity.com - both are reasonably priced or can be scaled to an upper price limit. Asos.com offers free shipping too! If you are in Canada, try Kijiji or VarageSale. I've had a ton of luck on those places."

BabyBumps,3dz2w5,jules0072,6,Mon Jul 20 21:09:57 2015 UTC,I feel like I might be the only one here but I just can't seem to find anything that fits me well from asos. And believe me I have tried and tried. Which is such a shame! They're stuff is so cute and their customer service is wonderful! But the fit - terrible on me!  I personally have had much better luck with old navy and almost everything Jessica Simpson maternity. Also the motherhood maternity store brand stuff has fit me well as well.
BabyBumps,3dz2w5,dezebel,3,Tue Jul 21 03:32:58 2015 UTC,Asos has the WORST customer service. I had terrible experiences twice before I decided no more.
BabyBumps,3dz2w5,moxypie,11,Tue Jul 21 06:12:14 2015 UTC,Came here to also say that asos saved my work wardrobe when I was pregnant! Some of their stuff is questionable style-wise but I managed to find some affordable stables like blouses and black jeans that I wore almost everyday after the 20 week mark.
BabyBumps,3dz2w5,cheddarkitty,9,Tue Jul 21 00:28:17 2015 UTC,I guess I just don't see them as affordable. I had a $20 per item rule (excludes coats and boots) that I stuck to before getting pregnant and I certainly don't intend to spend $45 on a top I will only wear for a few months.
BabyBumps,3dz2w5,moxypie,5,Tue Jul 21 13:08:22 2015 UTC,"I totally get the $20 per item rule, but unfortunately you may have to adjust the way you shop when it comes to maternity. I'm guessing you're in the states which means you are likely used to excessively cheap clothing. In Canada, our prices are significantly higher and without shopping at WalMart I automatically hit $20 just about everywhere I go. I would suggest that you try a capsule wardrobe approach with maternity clothes. Fewer items, but higher quality. Pick up some really good basics - a great pair of dark wash jeans, a couple pairs of dress pants, a skirt. Add a couple good quality cardigans or blazers, and pair with some cheaper tops. If they are high quality and Classic pieces they should wear well and last through this and any subsequent pregnancies. The tops can be changed out over time and when deals come up. Oldnavy.com has tons of cheap tanks and tees for $6 or similar.   The other option could be to spend some time bargain hunting at Ross or wherever for things like stretchy maxi dresses and other items that aren't maternity but have the right shape and stretch to last you through the end."
BabyBumps,3dz2w5,Thr33wolfmoon,10,Tue Jul 21 14:19:21 2015 UTC,"I have invested in some maternity jeans that were $35 a pair. My old blazers still fit and I bought quite a few tees and tanks from Old Navy when they had a 30% off sale. So I definitely have things to wear, solid colored classic pieces that wont go out of style when we have #2. They just aren't as ""cute"" or ""trendy"" as a lot of the pieces from places like asos and motherhood. But I suppose now is not the time to worry about being trendy! Haha!"
BabyBumps,3dz2w5,aceinva,5,Tue Jul 21 16:46:24 2015 UTC,"I swear, none of the people designing these took the fact that boobs tend to get bigger into consideration.

BabyBumps,3dz2w5,Erozett,4,Mon Jul 20 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"A huge second to ThredUp, they have saved my ass for workwear.  I've gotten gap and ann taylor stuff there for a fraction of what it would have been even on clearance."
BabyBumps,3dz2w5,mmm_pickles,5,Mon Jul 20 23:39:40 2015 UTC,And the quality is such crap!! I'm looking at you Motherhood - yoga pant fabric does not make for dress slacks!

BabyBumps,3dz2w5,Erozett,9,Mon Jul 20 19:10:26 2015 UTC,"LOFT. YES. My favorite ""work appropriate"" maternity pants are from Loft. I could only bring myself to pay for one pair of them (clearly I missed the 50% off sale), but I wear them multiple times every week (pregnancy = no shame) and they've been amazing. Hope they work out as well for you."
BabyBumps,3dz2w5,mmm_pickles,9,Mon Jul 20 20:20:10 2015 UTC,I'm glad you like yours! Sign up for their emails. They do big sales frequently. I got three pairs of pants and a top for $120 total!

BabyBumps,3dz2w5,thesoulofwit1231,2,Mon Jul 20 21:39:09 2015 UTC,Yessss! The quality is killing me. Super cheap fabrics that encourage disco-level BO by 9:30am for prices I'd usually only drop on something that could wear nicely for several seasons.

BabyBumps,3dz2w5,BumpQuestions,2,Mon Jul 20 18:28:43 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I wish there were different stages of maternity clothes.  I'm going on 17 weeks and getting a decent bump.  But all these maternity clothes I ordered online from Old Navy are way toooo big and all the t-shirts are frickin' see-through.  Most of the maternity pants are also way too big so far, but I'm not too thrilled with the hair tie trick either.  If I actually have to leave the house, I mostly wear either regular size drawstring capris I have or a couple of cotton maternity dresses from Target that have sides that'll grow with me but so far the dress is form-fitting enough that I don't quite look like I'm wearing a potato sack."

Now they're all tight on the belly if they fit elsewhere, and if they fit the belly they're baggy everywhere else! All the pants and shorts I bought are also not fitting anymore. Spent so much money! And definitely see through. I know people think the belly button is cute (I still don't have an outie but you can see where it is) but I'd rather not have it show through my clothes as a dark spot.

BabyBumps,3dz2w5,CreativeButtons,2,Tue Jul 21 01:08:52 2015 UTC,"I know we're all just commiserating here, but I do want to suggest looking into Storq (storq.com). I have their clothing basics bundle, and while they're not cheap, they're comparable in price but great quality. The dress and skirt feel great (modal and spandex) and look great in a biz-caz environment with the right shoes/accessories."
BabyBumps,3dz2w5,alwaystryharder,2,Tue Jul 21 01:19:07 2015 UTC,"I feel the exact same way! unfortunately at 17 weeks, maternity clothes are too baggy on me and my clothes are too tight on me. I'm so fricken frumpy right now. I'm having luck with Thyme maternity and their 50% off clearance items. I ended getting a cardigan for $10 and a striped (ha surprise!) tshirt for around there as well. I paid full price $50 for yoga pants with a seam down the front to appear like ""dress pants""  the quality is absolute shite though. The cute dress tops I ordered off the gap look like $5 shirts I can get at H&M."
BabyBumps,3dz2w5,MISTRESSshake,2,Mon Jul 20 19:21:01 2015 UTC,"TRUTH! I do enjoy ordering from Pink blush online though. I find their clothes are pretty good quality or the price and they fit true to size. I bouth 2 maxi dresses, 2 tanks, and a pair of capris and they all fit great!"

Got about $450 worth retail for a little over $100 :\ including dresses and snazzy work clothes.   EDIT: I have a bunch of 50% off one item (in store only) if anyone is interested :) Probably won't be using them because I'm broke and all my money needs to go towards diapers lol

You just have to get creative with sizing and fit. Stretchy knits can still look professional (I'm on the west coast). If you can't do that, my friends on the east coast tell me men's shirts are big enough to cover the bump. Then you pair it with maternity pants or skirt and a cardigan for casual or just leave your blazer open.   Maternity clothes are overpriced, poor quality, and terrible fit."
BabyBumps,3dz2w5,snailien,2,Tue Jul 21 00:04:17 2015 UTC,I bought a lot of my professional work clothes from ASOS. I religiously went through all of the maternity clothes that were on sale.

I'm due at the end of October, live in Buffalo, and don't drive so I'm pretty happy I'm going to get away with not buying a bigger winter coat and nice hoodies/sweaters just for a couple of months.

I remember seeing your post early on and thinking how cool to have another twin bumper so close to my date :) Are you having boys too?  Sometimes one gets the other riled up, other times I wonder how the other one is sleeping through the other twins shenanigans. It seems like so much more movement throughout the day when they switch off. Seems like in the mornings they are both going and it looks/feels like an octopus writhing around in there!"

Curious - feel free to not answer, but have they given you an expected date to have them by? My dr told me not to expect to go past 36 weeks, but that seems so early. ANd, they didn't really say one way or the other about how they would not let them go past 36 weeks!"
BabyBumps,3dz7hi,CreativeButtons,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:44:11 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, I definitely get the waves! So crazy considering they will still get so much bigger. We're most likely having fraternal twins as they are di/di, but I'm still holding out hope that they're identical. My drs haven't mentioned anything about how long I may go or c-sections or anything really. It's kind of frustrating. I switched drs hoping to get better care for the twin pregnancy and it mostly seems like they're just trying to shuffle me out the door each time I have an appointment. Do yours share a placenta or a sac? That may make them want to take them sooner. Other than that I can't see them saying that unless you're already having pregnancy issues. But I can't really understand a lot of doctors' logic in regards to things."
BabyBumps,3dz7hi,MsCataria,2,Mon Jul 20 22:16:25 2015 UTC,"I was originally diagnosed as mo/mo, but at my 12 week scan they found the thinnest of thin membranes and now consider me mo/di so they share a placenta. I have been getting really great care, I can't complain about that - I have an ultrasound ever other week, which is a lot, but better safe than sorry I suppose. We have't discussed anything further than don't expect to go past Oct 10... But what that means I don't know. I see them again on Friday, so I think it is probably time to start talking about it. They are keen to let me deliver naturally as long as A is head down. Do you have any other kids, or is this your first and second!"
BabyBumps,3dz7hi,CreativeButtons,6,Tue Jul 21 02:53:14 2015 UTC,"NICU nurse here, since they share a placenta your docs might be more concerned about Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome (DON'T GOOGLE IT, it's just gonna stress you out!) or disconcordinant growth - basically near the end twins that share a placenta can start growing at different rates because one twin steals all the groceries and the other stops growing as well. In my experience the docs were much more forgiving about letting twin moms go past 36 weeks as long as growth patterns for both kids were looking good! Congrats on your twins!"

I struggled a lot with this pregnancy in the first few weeks as I had miscarried prior. Once you give up the need to control everything, and you accept that something may happen but for now you will enjoy, it makes the journey much easier.  Also, I continue to drink my mint and ginger herbal teas. My doctor hasn't said anything about it, and I'm not drinking gallons. Perhaps just a cup or two a day. I also do straight lemon juice in hot water.  Good luck, and enjoy these months!"
BabyBumps,3e133f,rpsychnurse,4,Tue Jul 21 03:34:19 2015 UTC,"I stopped weighing myself months ago. I'm 27+1. It was upsetting me.   Are you eating healthily? If not, try to do that. Do you feel healthy & good in yourself? If so, that's the main thing! Has your doctor made any comments? Complained about your weight at all? If not, there's probably a reason for that.   Just try & make healthy choices, eat little & often & try not to beat yourself up about it. Everyone's pregnancy is different & sometimes I guess your body just does what it needs to. I don't know your starting weight but maybe you needed to gain a bit more anyway?  Good luck sweetheart :) if you're really worried maybe have a chat with your doctor & see what he/she recommends."

Also, if your doctor tells you you're doing fine, then don't worry.  And, you say that your diet ""isn't that bad""... but what exactly are you eating? Is there room for improvement?  Also... stop weighing yourself daily, weekly, whatever. If it bothers you so much, weighing yourself so much isn't going to do anything but stress you out more. Step away from the scale!"

BabyBumps,3e06kg,Jonora_13,20,Mon Jul 20 23:07:00 2015 UTC,My three: 1: Look at a video or a real life example of a good latch. Don't let baby suck with a bad latch. 2: Nothing makes milk better than an empty breast. 3: New babies don't need schedules or limits. Let her nurse as long and as often as she wants to. That's how your milk will get established.
BabyBumps,3e06kg,timefornap,10,Mon Jul 20 23:11:13 2015 UTC,"I was going to say basically the same things. Definitely watch a video (there are some on youtube) and make sure your latch is right.  I would add though: for the first week or two, it CAN hurt initially even if the latch is correct.  Count to ten.  If it STILL hurts, then immediately take baby off and relatch."

BabyBumps,3e06kg,SrslyYouToo,10,Tue Jul 21 18:07:30 2015 UTC,"Education about breastfeeding is extremely important.  Research research research, in the culture we live in, we no longer have circles of experienced moms to help us.   Not ALL lactations consultants know what they are talking about... if one isn't helping, get another.   Example: I had one lactation consultant tell me that cluster feeding was a myth and that at every feeding I was to unlatch my kid at the 20 minute mark, and that was all I needed for supply regulation.   Just because something is 'normal' about breastfeeding for someone else, does not make it 'normal' for you.    Example: My kid had an awesome latch, he had a tongue tie clipped at 6 weeks and I was still in excruciating pain for 3 months because I guess it just took longer to toughen up my nipples... that was MY normal."
BabyBumps,3e06kg,aerrin,11,Mon Jul 20 23:12:51 2015 UTC,"Just because something is 'normal' about breastfeeding for someone else, does not make it 'normal' for you.   I love this. I think that's why I find /r/breastfeeding so helpful. I've often felt blessed that my breastfeeding relationship with my son has been so easy, but in retrospect, we've had a number of hurdles - it's just that I've also had a community of helpful, supportive women who've helped me understand the range of 'normal', and so when faced with an overly-sleepy newborn, cluster feeding, a strong letdown, a baby who only eats on one side at a time, an oversupply, or a sudden drop in pumping output, I never once thought 'oh, he hates it' or 'we're doing this wrong' or 'I can't do this'.   I always thought 'this is our normal' and found advice on how to deal with it. /r/breastfeeding taught me about everything from block feeding to pump maintenance to pumping schedules. And I know now that things like 'nursing strikes' exist and that they can be overcome.    So really, I'm blessed to have such great reddit communities."
BabyBumps,3e06kg,aerrin,2,Tue Jul 21 13:33:35 2015 UTC,"Knowing what's ""normal"" is so difficult when you're doing something you have never done before, or even been around very much. I think that's the biggest difference between my first and second babies...I have an established ""normal"".  And that's why good lactation consultants are so important. New moms need to know what really is normal and what needs correction. The bad advice you described is so very dangerous and can be worse than no help at all."
BabyBumps,3e06kg,SrslyYouToo,7,Tue Jul 21 06:09:28 2015 UTC,"Knowing what's ""normal"" is so difficult when you're doing something you have never done before, or even been around very much.   I think this is one of the saddest things about the generational breastfeeding gap. My mom is supportive of my breastfeeding, but at 3.5 months, I've already breastfed my son twice as long as she breastfed either of her children, and so she can't be a source of advice for me. And breastfeeding affects so much of a baby's schedule - they eat and sleep differently than formula fed babies. So even there, her expectations are different."
BabyBumps,3e06kg,SadPandaOuch,7,Tue Jul 21 13:36:52 2015 UTC,"What bothered me about my normal was everyone telling me ""Pain is NOT NORMAL! You must be doing something wrong!"" But my kid was gaining weight like a champ, my supply was amazing, his latch was perfect, no one could figure it out. And then one day it just stopped hurting.  It was hard ignoring everyone and thinking for months that I was screwing it up when that was just how my body did things.   I cringe still whenever I see that advice because so many women are like... Everything seems to be working, latch is good kid is fed, it just hurts and it's been the requisite two weeks! Everyone said it shouldn't be hurting! And there is always someone who chimes in that pain is not normal, and I'm sure in a lot of cases it's not.. But SOMETIMES it is!"
BabyBumps,3e06kg,SrslyYouToo,6,Tue Jul 21 06:28:08 2015 UTC,"Also- I'm 95% sure I had thrush with my first, but we were so focused on his bad latch, it wasn't caught. Just because latch is bad and it is painful doesn't mean there isn't also something else going on. I ended up excusively pumping for him because of the pain. Nursed my second with zero problems until getting thrush after an antibiotic course at 18 months, took meds, it was a quick fix, was able to keep nursing. Seriously after two doses the pain was almost gone. It is upsetting to think that it could have been that easy to improve things with my first :("
BabyBumps,3e06kg,dalikin,5,Tue Jul 21 12:02:23 2015 UTC,"I thought that I might have had thrush, but it just did not add up... I was in pain, but not even close to the description of what thrush feels like... I didn't have mastitis, it was literally just painful nipples!  I did find SOME people on r/breastfeeding that said that sometimes pain into 3-4 months can be normal, so I stuck it out and low and behold... it was just me."
BabyBumps,3e06kg,kiwi1855,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:36 2015 UTC,"How much you pump is not a good indicator of your supply if you are EBF. Your baby's growth and number of wet/poo nappies are the best indicators of your supply, nothing else. If baby is growing well and having good nappies, your supply is fine. Don't put your baby on a feeding schedule. Even if your baby only fed 30 minutes ago, if she is crying and seems hungry, feed her again. Newborns feed every few hours, or every hour, or multiple times in an hour, depending on the baby, the time of day, the age of the baby, and other mysterious factors. If you don't know why your baby is crying and you've tried everything else, try feeding her again. If you ever replace a breastfeed with a bottle feed and you want to keep your supply up, you need to pump in place of that feed to maintain your supply."
BabyBumps,3e06kg,aerrin,5,Tue Jul 21 01:43:09 2015 UTC,"Don't encourage a bad latch. Watch videos of latching to see a good latch.  Unlatch if your baby has a bad latch. Use the lanolin after every feed even if you ""don't think you need it"".  When you get to the point of pain and you need it, it hurts longer. For the first while, ignore any demands on your time except for baby's feeding needs. Company (even family) need to know they are not as important as baby's needs.  You and baby need to establish and learn how to breastfeed.  Personally, I literally didn't move from my couch for the first week and a half except to pee.  I even slept on the couch.  Bassinet was beside me, but baby was in my arms 90% of the day.  Feed on demand, feed as long as baby wants to. Offer the other breast.  Time is not important, nor is it something to focus on for judging success.  Wet and dirty diapers are the point of judgment for that. Make a nest for yourself.  Water bottle, snacks, pillows, blankets, Netflix/movie/fully charged phone.  Be prepared for a totally unpredictable feeding schedule.  Cluster feeding is real and a bitch to deal with (my two month old spent this past weekend cluster feeding...).  Make yourself as comfortable as possible to remain as sane and relaxed as possible.  Frustration only makes it harder.  Deep breaths, focus on your baby.     Can I add a fourth? Don't beat yourself up if you can't breastfeed to WHATEVER REASON.  Yes, breastfeeding gives your baby a perfect food, tailored to them complete with antibodies.  HOWEVER: AT THE END OF THE DAY, FED IS BEST.  Formula or breast... As long as baby is growing and healthy that's the goal.  Don't stress yourself out if for whatever reason you can't breastfeed.  You tried, you did your best.  Formula is not the end of the world, and your baby deserves a mommy that isn't beating herself up over something that she couldn't control.  Good luck.  Talk to an lc, go to an LLL meeting.  You got this mama!!"
BabyBumps,3e06kg,BespectacledOwl,2,Tue Jul 21 04:51:13 2015 UTC,"Great advice.  And yes, #4 should be on the list as well."
BabyBumps,3e06kg,classy_mcsuxmoore,-19,Tue Jul 21 06:14:22 2015 UTC,"Your supply is not indicated by how often your baby wants to eat or how much you pump. Wanting to be at the boob constantly, especially in the early days, is completely normal. It does not mean you don't have enough milk, or that your milk is somehow causing problems. Babies suck to regulate supply and for comfort AS WELL AS for food. And they're much much more efficient at removing milk than pumps. I've fed my son immediately after pumping before (one of those 'oops, he's hungry an hour early!' things) and he's still gotten a good belly-full. The amount you pump can also vary wildly from session to session because of factors like time of day, water consumption, even stress levels.  Watch videos of a good latch, but also of the suck-suck-swallow pattern. As your baby gets older, it's fine to decide he's done if he's not really eating and you need to get stuff done! Knowing what eating vs comfort sucking looks like helped me with this.  It gets so, so, so much easier as it goes. Not just the pain, but also the attention and time it takes. Your kiddo gains head control and you can nurse handsfree. They also get more efficient, and it's normal for an older baby to be done eating in under 10 minutes. It is not always being chained to a chair for huge stretches of time. And it happens /quickly/! I know 6 weeks or 8 weeks seems like a long time at the beginning, but there's a little bit of progress every week, and by two months, your nursing relationship will be so different from that needy newborn.   And I can't resist a fourth, which is that every breastfeeding relationship is different, and it will take some time to figure yours out. Your kiddo might be a gulper, or he might be a nibbler. He might have a better latch in a different hold. He might fit better on a different pillow. He might love to cuddle close and comfort suck but not really need it, or he might desperately need that cuddle time. You might have to learn tricks to keep him awake. He might struggle with a strong letdown or get impatient at a slow one. He might want both breasts every time, or only ever feed on one. Every baby and every mom is different. It's why communities like /r/breastfeeding are so, so important. You can get a variety of opinions, perspectives, and ideas, and most of the time at least one of them feels right!"
BabyBumps,3e06kg,MsBud,46,Tue Jul 21 13:27:22 2015 UTC,"These are so good, especially about how nursing changes."
BabyBumps,3e06kg,BespectacledOwl,9,Tue Jul 21 14:13:56 2015 UTC,"Get everything you need BEFORE you sit down to feed; go to the bathroom, get a giant bottle of water and maybe a snack. You may be sitting for 45-60 mins and you need to keep yourself well while you do Experiment with different holds for the baby, and different pillows/armrest etc. No one thing works for everyone. Give at least 1 month before trying to express to ""get some extra sleep"". Your body and bay work together to establish supply, plus you risk paying for skipping a feed with painful mastitis"
BabyBumps,3e06kg,aerrin,3,Tue Jul 21 02:20:19 2015 UTC,"People who tell you it isn't gonna hurt are dirty liars. You shouldn't bleed or be in huge amounts of pain, but the little hoovers suck hard and it sucks hard for a few days... Weeks... Months...  The best description of a good latch I read was - aim the nipple at the TOP of their mouth (the roof) and put the bottom half of your areola in their mouth. Part of your areola should be visible. Hold your boob like a sandwich and shove that shit in there, far back in their mouth. Don't be afraid to pop them off and try again.  Nothing drains a boob like a baby. Pumping is not an indication of how much you're producing - wet Diapers and weight gain are."
BabyBumps,3e06kg,BespectacledOwl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:45:22 2015 UTC,"Early on, your baby is going to fuss and ask to nurse a lot. Don't be alarmed! This is them establishing your milk supply. It is normal, not an indication that you need to supplement. If you supplement, especially without pumping, you will hurt your supply.  A newborn's stomach is about the size of a cherry in their first few days. That means the tiny drops of colostrum you have at each feeding in the beginning are totally sufficient. Don't believe anyone who tells you this is not enough! You shouldn't be filling a bottle that early on.  Get help. If you're having latch issues or any other problems, get expert advice. Perhaps more important: In your first few weeks after birth, you should be focused primarily on just two things: recovering from birth & establishing nursing (aka cuddling skin-to-skin & nursing on demand). Your partner (if around) & family should be taking care of you (bringing food & water, etc), and all the other stuff around the house so you can do those things. Put family & visitors to work, don't let them just love on the baby while you do chores! Stay off your feet as much as possible. Eat, rest, and nurse."
BabyBumps,3e06kg,samsg1,3,Tue Jul 21 04:25:03 2015 UTC,"This makes me think we also need a list of three things never to say to a new nursing mom. One thing would be ""you're not making enough milk"" or the closely related ""she's fussy because your milk isn't enough""."
BabyBumps,3e06kg,nannerbooboo,-15,Tue Jul 21 06:13:23 2015 UTC,"Amen! Let me also add 'he has gas because you ate that spicy food'.   Breastmilk is made from blood, not food.

You just bunch it up like you're getting ready to put on hose or stockings. Start at either end (the toe) and slowly work it on. It'll take some tugging and strategic pulling. But it only took about 5 minutes or so to get on that way. I hope you can make it work too.

Did you seriously have zero warning? I live 10 mins from the hospital and am super super frustrated with being in here :/ but then I hear stories like yours and think ""well...shit"".  AUGH. I've been 2cm dilated for two weeks now :((  How's your baby? What interventions (if any) does she need? They gave me a tour of the NICU last week and it just caused me massive anxiety haha!"
BabyBumps,3dy7z1,flapjacksal,5,Mon Jul 20 16:59:09 2015 UTC,"I literally had zero warning. They were keeping me on bedrest on the monitors 24 hours a day and I was getting antsy, so I was begging to be off the monitors. I had finally stopped bleeding from the amnio reduction and so they thought oh what the hell, we'll leave you off for 10 hours so you can get comfortable for a while. Well a few hours off the monitor and I felt really constipated and suddenly I was crying from what I thought were ""not able to take a shit"" cramps, then all of a sudden it was like oh shit, I'm in labor. And with the snap of a finger I went from 2 to 7 and was screaming for an epidural, which luckily happened and slowed her down a little bit. But she was a super fast labor, when my water broke because of the polyhydraminos, it was comparable to one of those buckets at water parks that fills up and dumps out spilling gallons of water everywhere (on the floor, the doctors, the med students, the nurses, the emergency c section team that was there just in case, and narrowly missed the nicu team huddling in the corner.  after that she was ready to go and out she came in 1 and a half pushes.   As far as going to tour nicu, I didn't even get to do that, but the nicu doctor came to talk to me right after I got my epidural and I did panic a little because it was a lot of info to process and the things she was saying we're hard to process in general (ie- all your worst nightmares becoming possibilities for your child, which luckily none of them did actually become them. Take the time now to process that info, but also know that in an nicu team, they are the best for your baby and they know what they are doing and they do it quickly and they showed amazing genuine care. It's hard not having your baby next to you or in your room with you or being able to hold them BUT they are doing an excellent job and studies have shown that the babies are no less attached to their parents than full term babies who get to be with their parents from square one. It's tough, but it's doable and I'd rather have her safe than anything else. The interventions she needs are minor, she needed surfactant in her lungs, which almost every preemie needs anyway and that was it. They already took out her breathing tube after less than 12 hours, and even when she had it in she was still breathing on her own. She's on her umbilical iv that they will change to a picc line tomorrow. And she's already going to be ready for some skin to skin tonight!! We're very lucky she is doing so well and I hope this helps you to calm any worries. You're already further along than I was too, so you've got even less to worry about :) good luck and don't go too stir crazy in the hospital."
BabyBumps,3dy7z1,surrogateuterus,6,Tue Jul 21 01:28:05 2015 UTC,"Oh! Good, I was gonna suggest skin to skin. It helped my niece. She was born a lil later, 34 weeks. But no one told my sister she could hold her for two weeks. Once she started doing skin to skin, it took 4 days and they were discharged.   Good luck.to you. I hope it's smooth sailing for you two!"

BabyBumps,3e0er6,rabidsmiles,4,Tue Jul 21 02:03:41 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your loss.   This happened to me, and your post freaked me out. This is inadequate levels of care for you. Your doctor should not send you away and tell you things are probably normal. Your doctor needs to take a look at your uterus to be sure there's no retained tissue. A blood test is not enough.   You've been bleeding for two weeks. That sounds like some tissue is retained. If you don't have the money or the ability to find a doctor who will check you, then go to planned parenthood.   The only reason I am still fertile is because I went to planned parenthood. The catholic hospital I was going to left me with retained tissue for days. I'm incredibly lucky I didn't get an infection."
BabyBumps,3e0er6,Yassssmaam,2,Tue Jul 21 02:27:45 2015 UTC,This is scary. We think it just happened this weekend when the cramping + heavy bleeding started... They want me to go back in in a week so... ?   How did they check you to see if tissue was retained? I had a pretty terrible first time experience with my hospital/doctors. They were so nonchalant about it all.
BabyBumps,3e0er6,Yassssmaam,6,Tue Jul 21 02:40:48 2015 UTC,"My doctor was like yours ""oh well it will be fine. You couldn't have been as far along as you think..."" (I had been tracking with an app so I knew exactly how far I was).   The doctor refused to give me a physical exam and wouldn't offer any pain meds - I didn't ask they just told me I couldn't have any - and otherwise would not interfere at all. I think their protocol was that they weren't allowed to do anything that could hurt a viable fetus. So that meant I spent two days in labor - projectile vomiting and losing control of my bowels and in incredible pain. I called the doctor three times but the nurses kept telling me it was fine. after the second day of this, my husband was like ""we are taking you anywhere they will look at you TODAY.""   We called planned parenthood because that's where I got my birth control. They told me to come in right away. They did an ultrasound, confirmed the presence of tissue but no sack or heartbeat, gave me pain meds, and scheduled me for a D&C immediately. They said I should have been checked for a heartbeat and given the abortion pill as soon as it was confirmed there was no heartbeat. They recommended the abortion pill anyway, but by then I'd had too much pain for too long and couldn't face it. They said it is less painful but I couldn't do any more. We were too devastated by the loss. I needed it to be over.  Now I'm nine months pregnant. I can barely drive by that awful catholic hospital without having a flashback, and I'm catholic. But everything is great. I didn't sue them, but I did send a letter outlining what they did, how it hurt me, and what they should have done. It made me feel better.   We are also sending a picture of our daughter to planned parenthood. They're the reason she's here. I think that's catholic hospital wouldn't give me an ultrasound because they were only trying to preserve the fetus. They didn't want to know it wasn't viable. They didn't care about my ultimate fertility.   Anyway, I'm sorry this happened to you. Please don't wait any longer. Someone needs to see why you are bleeding for two weeks and what is going on."
BabyBumps,3e0er6,singwejoyous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:55:32 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry this is happening to you. I agree that it's a little strange that they want to start with blood work after a likely miscarriage. If you've had a bad experience with them, find a new office.  To answer your question, they just do an ultrasound to check for retained tissue. However some people will bleed awhile after naturally miscarrying even if there's no tissue retained.  As horrible as it is you can read lots of people's experiences at /r/miscarriage and other subs.  FTIW, my body didn't want to let go of my miscarriage at 6 weeks and I ended up having the D&C surgery to remove the remaining tissue. I was terrified of surgery but it was the best thing to do and I only wished I'd done it sooner.   Sorry for your loss and take care."
BabyBumps,3e0x3m,ccgamercc,7,Tue Jul 21 02:42:58 2015 UTC,"Ok, I don't want to alarm you.  Everything is probably fine.  But, if this is totally new, I'd go get checked.  A coworker of mine experienced something very similar.  It ended after several hours, and she didn't think much of it.  At her next appointment, she found out that her fluid had unexpectedly become critically low, and she lost her baby.  This is a very rare scenario, and everything is probably fine, but if you're gut is telling you to get checked, I would do it, just to be on the safe side."
BabyBumps,3e0x3m,Rippersole,3,Tue Jul 21 03:44:08 2015 UTC,"I've also had a friend this happened to. Apparently extreme movement very late in pregnancy can also indicate umbilical cord issues, likely followed by less or no movement."
BabyBumps,3e0x3m,Axenus,3,Tue Jul 21 10:35:18 2015 UTC,"My second child was a mover, like all the damn time... during most of the day, during the night, always kicking and turning and bumping and rolling...  It seemed to be CONSTANT.  He is 12 months now, and if he is awake his is moving.. crawling, climbing, grabbing... general baby crazy."
BabyBumps,3e0wdt,babynursebb,6,Tue Jul 21 02:37:00 2015 UTC,"So we always think of fmla as block leave after baby, but it can be used intermittently as well during pregnancy with the necessary doctor's notes. It would take time from after baby, but it saves your job."
BabyBumps,3e0wdt,melissarose8585,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:36:04 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat. My job doesn't allow more than 60 hours off in a rolling 6 month period (much more forgiving than yours, though!). I just got a ""verbal"" warning a few weeks ago, but it seems like I'm getting constant morning sickness at the start of my second trimester. I'm worried about getting in trouble as well. I asked my supervisor about using FMLA for when I need to take a night off, but she never ever got back to me, so I ended up puking my guts out at work last week. If you find any useful information, pass it my way!"
BabyBumps,3e0o93,amychelle79,5,Tue Jul 21 01:30:51 2015 UTC,"Wow. I was very conscience of buying/accepting what I thought I NEEDED and Instill had way too much (clothes, burp clothes, toys, etc). I wouldn't know where to begin with someone forcing stuff on me much less expecting me to pay for it. As a matter of fact, I would almost pay someone to take out extra stuff off our hands. Good luck!"
BabyBumps,3e0o93,Ahedge,3,Tue Jul 21 01:38:26 2015 UTC,"Right now I have very little. Some clothes that I've crafted,  been gifted, or got dirt cheap AND really liked  (I won't buy something just because it's inexpensive or a good deal, I have to like it.) my family bought the crib and a car seat. And a few diapers and toys from a small informal shower.   I know I need more. But I have at least 3 showers coming. Family,  friends,  and work.   If he comes tomorrow I have enough to get by until I can shop."
BabyBumps,3e0o93,Penthesillea,4,Tue Jul 21 03:22:31 2015 UTC,"That's really weird to me. Imagine if you were in the market for something else, like a car, how weird would it be to have her harassing you to buy her overpriced used car? It's not being ungrateful, its not wanting to buy someones overpriced used crap. If you wanted a bunch of used baby stuff, I'm sure Goodwill would love to have your business."
BabyBumps,3e0o93,Fifi6313,4,Tue Jul 21 04:59:13 2015 UTC,"It's ok to be annoyed, it's annoying.   If she needs to sell things she should post them to a buy/sell/swap page on Facebook or craigslist. She doesn't need to come after friends to unload her pricey hand me downs. Especially since you have already politely told her that you are waiting to stock up until after your showers.   I have a friend who recently tried to sell most of her possessions on Facebook (she wants to build a tiny home). She had some nice things, but also some old coffee mugs, pencils cups and general clutter type things. I can't imagine asking someone to give me money for a used plastic pencil cup. Some things should just be donated or thrown out."
BabyBumps,3e0o93,cactuscat,3,Tue Jul 21 05:25:34 2015 UTC,"I think listing things and seeing if anyone bites is fine, but yeah some people have unrealistic ideas about what their used things are worth. All they see is what they paid for it and this biases their expectation."
BabyBumps,3e0o93,potatochippy91,3,Tue Jul 21 07:22:54 2015 UTC,"I understand you completely, I'm all for hand me downs, but certain things you want to pick out and buy yourself and I'd get annoyed if she kept pushing after you mentioned wanting to wait until after your shower...if she wants to get rid of it so badly maybe she should just gift you some of it at one of your showers! :p"

BabyBumps,3e0wa7,nannywife,4,Tue Jul 21 02:35:58 2015 UTC,"I had a velamentous cord insertion with my daughter. It caused my blood pressure to be really high and she didn't grow very big. I had to have her via c-section at 37 weeks so I wouldn't go into labor and rosh a placental abruption. Sure enough, my doctor hung the cord over the cloth partition and the cord was barely hanging in there. Being given information like that is scary but just trust your doc unless you feel like something is up and need a second opinion. Good luck!"
BabyBumps,3e0wa7,seb4790,2,Tue Jul 21 04:09:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the cord but if she didn't immediately order an additional scan it might not be something that's too crazy worrisome. My midwives always push and prod and mess with my belly at every appointment to check the fundal height, check baby's position, and feel out how big he is. Pretty standard, nothing to worry about! They've been doing this since 18w for me."
BabyBumps,3e0wa7,BumpQuestions,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:45:16 2015 UTC,"Today was my first appointment since the scan and she told me today. I think if it were something worrisome then she would have called.  Good to know, maybe it's just because I'm further along now?"
BabyBumps,3e0wa7,BumpQuestions,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:53:47 2015 UTC,I think if it was super concerning they definitely would have called you right away and asked you to come in. You can always call the nurse line in the morning and ask for some clarification!
BabyBumps,3e0j8t,_Pandasaurus_,29,Tue Jul 21 00:49:50 2015 UTC,"Because tracking your weight can signal them to check for certain issues without other symptoms... i suggest you do what I did.  Explain that you have history of an eating disorder and ask that they weigh you while you face away from the scale and then not tell you the results. Similarly, ask them not to let your SO know either."
BabyBumps,3e0j8t,MaeBeWeird,8,Tue Jul 21 00:55:52 2015 UTC,"This, a thousand times this. Communication is the only way you will see positive results. Without talking to your providers about this, you are just going to cause yourself anxiety."
BabyBumps,3e0j8t,BumpQuestions,3,Tue Jul 21 02:11:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you don't have to know the number, only they do to help you with your health. There's zero reason why your SO needs to know, too. The doc should work with you on this."
BabyBumps,3e0j8t,sucumber,5,Tue Jul 21 06:33:11 2015 UTC,I always step on the scale backwards at the doctor's office. My ED therapist has trained me very well to do that.
BabyBumps,3e0j8t,Merisiel,3,Tue Jul 21 09:47:05 2015 UTC,"I am recovering from a years long struggle with an eating disorder, so my heart goes out to you in the realest way. Every time you get weighed, you definitely reserve the right to tell the nurse weighing you that you don't want her to tell you the number. In my experience, this always works. You can also tell the nurse to write in your chart or tell the doctor not to mention the number to you. My OB team has fully understood and had no problem keeping the number a secret. Good luck! If you're super worried about it, try calling ahead and explaining your situation to the nurses station. They're professionals and they want you to enjoy your experience there, I promise :)"
BabyBumps,3e0j8t,graceepoche,2,Tue Jul 21 00:55:08 2015 UTC,"Totally understandable. Just close your eyes when they weigh you and let your OB and all nurses/techs know not to let you know your weight. But, they have to keep track of your weight on your record."
BabyBumps,3e0j8t,UnicornToots,2,Tue Jul 21 01:16:36 2015 UTC,Just don't look at your weight when they take it at he doctor - face the other way and let your doctor know you don't want to know the numbers for body image issues. They can still get the info they need without you stressing out about the numbers. I'm going to have to start doing this because I'm starting to freak out and I really really don't want to hit 200.
BabyBumps,3e0j8t,kams88,2,Tue Jul 21 01:27:30 2015 UTC,"Every doctors office I've ever been to in my life has told me my weight outloud, even though I could obviously see it. Have I really just had crap luck? :/"
BabyBumps,3e0j8t,kams88,2,Tue Jul 21 01:43:20 2015 UTC,That's really weird. Just let them know you don't want to know the weight when the go to weigh you and they should keep their mouths shut.
BabyBumps,3e0j8t,monkeyface496,2,Tue Jul 21 01:48:15 2015 UTC,I don't like speaking up but I guess I'll have to. I mean...it is their job to care if I'm comfortable... :/
BabyBumps,3e0j8t,MaeBeWeird,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:14:34 2015 UTC,"Absolutely say something.  I'm a nurse and usually say the number out loud, mostly so I don't forget it while I'm walking back to the desk.  If a patient asked me not to tell them, I would keep quiet.  If they told me the reason was because of a history of ED or body image issues, then I would make every concerted effort to ensure their request was taken seriously by others on the team (with their consent of course).  My point is, the more they know the more they can help you."
BabyBumps,3e0j8t,kams88,2,Tue Jul 21 13:19:41 2015 UTC,"You won't be their first patient with a history of eating disorders. If they act like not telling you or you not looking is a bad thing, find a new doctor. But I highly doubt they will react that way."

BabyBumps,3e0j8t,pregball,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:58 2015 UTC,I've only been weighed twice so far and I'm 28 weeks - once at my first appointment and once at 24 weeks to track how my gain was going.  Surely it's not necessary for them to weigh you at every appointment unless visually it looks like there is cause to do so? I am the same as you and when losing weight several years ago became obsessed with the number of the scale and had to ban myself from them in the end. I asked not to be told my weight at my first appointment (which the midwife didn't but then the OB didn't realise and told me anyway :-/)
BabyBumps,3e0j8t,septicidal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:30:43 2015 UTC,"Man, lucky you.  My midwife LOVES to micromanage my weight - first appointment she wrote ""UNDERWEIGHT"" all in caps on my chart and tsked me for being underweight, and when I was four pounds heavier at my next appointment (not even sure I actually ""gained"" four pounds - I was so damn constipated) she tsked me for gaining too much weight between appointments.  I wish she could think about the bigger picture before just zeroing in on her little height/weight chart and lecturing me accordingly.  I seriously feel being a tiny bit ""UNDERWEIGHT"" at first and four pounds heavier four weeks later has literally NO bearing on the health and well-being of me or my baby."

Unfortunately, my little white cat sheds like a Great Pyrenees in the spring time and finding that damn hair everywhere is making me a tiny bit crazy. And woe to my husband if he leaves his dishes in the sink.  But on the upshot, today I've goodwilled half my old wardrobe, cleaned my entire house, organized my refrigerator, and it's starting to spill over into work. I might have redone the entire drystock area over the past few days. And by might I mean I absolutely did."

I know this isn't the same for every clinic though, not all of them have a counsellor on staff, and a few people in other forums I'm on have mentioned having to wait a few days after the scan to get their results from the midwife or obs. I'd check with your obstetrician or midwife to find out if they are sending the blood results to the ultrasound place or if you will get the final results from them. Or call the ultrasound clinic to find out their process. Good luck!"

Try some new positioning and maybe putting on some background noise like soft music if you normally don't. Something that keeps your brain occupied. I cried a few times during sex because I was frustrated that I couldn't get comfortable during all the activities, and my husband and I could not do the things we used to be able to do.

I think it's a self esteem problem... I eventually talked with him about it and he now makes extra special care to let me know that he loves me and just wants to be with me. Try increasing the foreplay and try not to be self  conscious. It helps me to have the lights off, a candle going, and music playing softly. Don't worry, it won't last forever :)"

BabyBumps,3dyr03,wehappy3,4,Mon Jul 20 18:35:44 2015 UTC,"I made a skirt steak quesadilla for first breakfast yesterday. Then second breakfast was pasta with butter and cheese, with a side of blueberries."

I am so damned suave...I can stand with one hand on the wall, put my other hand on my hip, just lean over and let go. I am even working on my puking accuracy--just put a little target at the bottom of the throne and let me score some extra points. After three decades of natural puking, I feel like a pro. ;)"

BabyBumps,3dyr03,wehappy3,9,Mon Jul 20 18:02:05 2015 UTC,Quince paste is a delicious substitute and it comes in a plastic tub so it's shatter proof. Cheese deserves fruit spread dammit!

BabyBumps,3dyr03,BumpQuestions,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:48:13 2015 UTC,"Driving has been hard for me, and the only food I've been craving is from a restaurant 30-40 minutes away. So the other day I finally worked up the energy to drive all the way and grab my sandwich from there. I was too excited to wait to get home to eat it, so I sat in the car with a movie up on my phone and ate everything as fast as I could without puking. It tasted so good that I started crying.  After I finished my food and made my way back home, I stopped off at Whole Foods for some cheesecake, a snack for the drive, chips, and a drink. And that all made me cry too."
BabyBumps,3dyr03,MakinABaby,5,Mon Jul 20 20:44:02 2015 UTC,Mm sounds delicious! We are supposed to move on Wedneaday so pretty much all of our food and cooking stuff is packed away. I went to the store to get essentials for us and bought NOTHING unhealthy at all- seriously! I resisted the whole time. But then I passed a Wendy's on my way home and pulled into the garage with a chocolate frosty and spicy nuggets. Mmmm.
BabyBumps,3dyr03,violetvgn,3,Mon Jul 20 19:01:15 2015 UTC,The combo of Wendy's spicy/salty foods and a frosty is like magic. It's heavenly.
BabyBumps,3dyr03,rachael_ruth,2,Tue Jul 21 00:40:13 2015 UTC,I think the worst thing about Wendy's is that one is across the street from me.  At least it's a busy street on a weird corner on the total opposite side of my apartment so I have to talk myself into driving there and it's kind of a huge pain in the ass exiting the drive thru.  But I eat there more than I'm willing to admit even to strangers online.

So we drove together and he went inside to grab it. :D  ...Not going to lie, though, this is something I'd be likely to do before the pregnancy as well."
BabyBumps,3dyr03,halfcream,2,Mon Jul 20 22:27:30 2015 UTC,I was hovering/squatting to pee in a public bathroom bc the seat was nasty and covered in pee. I was leaning forward so much and trying to center my stream that the stream flowed up and onto my lower belly towards my belly button and dripped on my underwear. All I could do was laugh. Next time I'll just wipe the seat and sit I guess.

BabyBumps,3dyr03,CreativeButtons,2,Mon Jul 20 17:24:08 2015 UTC,I had a dream last night that I was hot sweaty and hugely pregnant. My SO and I had stopped at a gas station on our way to go camping. My hands were full and I spot a soft serve ice cream machine I swear it had holy golden light all around it. I only had room to either hold the cone or pull the handle to get ice cream out. SO was in the bathroom and no one would help me I had a full on melt down and then fell and spilled the ice cream all over me. I woke up crying.

BabyBumps,3dyseq,1babybee,9,Mon Jul 20 17:08:21 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up- You may want to forgo the aloe on at least some of them. I've read multiple posts on BB saying that the aloe got a little... slimy.. once it had thawed (which happens pretty quickly). It might just be a personal preference thing, but my suggestion is to make a few with and a few without just to see for yourself. Also, not many people know this but to make a at-home ice pack, just put 1 part rubbing alcohol to 2 parts water in a ziplock freezer bag (I usually double up to prevent leaks). It makes a really nice gel pack but it won't freeze entirely. This is usually what they give you at the hospital in those long white ice pack things."

She still refused to I had to send her home and dock her day I couldn't fathom how she thought that it was ok.   Now that I am pregnant I am so self concious of what I am wearing for two reasons 1. I don't want the additional attention and 2. I would be mortified if my boss or coworkers thought I looked in appropriate.

BabyBumps,3dxxbe,rosekayleigh,13,Mon Jul 20 18:35:06 2015 UTC,"AMEN.  I'm 26 weeks and now and it's all I hear.  And I'm out of cute responses to make me feel less uncomfortable about it.  I'm pregnant, not some freak side show.  Yes, my stomach is bigger.  Yes, my boobs are bigger.  And if you think telling me that my face is ""fuller"" is going to make me feel anything but self-conscious and fat, screw you."
BabyBumps,3dxxbe,MR_icke,11,Mon Jul 20 17:11:17 2015 UTC,Yep 26 weeks here too and I was handling it as best I could until last week and then I just hit the end of my rope. I hate being a bitch so I really wish they would just take the hint and leave me alone. It's mostly our installers who I only see in the mornings. I'm just going to close my office door when I get in until they leave and hope it lets up. Crossing my fingers they don't catch me in the parking lot.
BabyBumps,3dxxbe,myratatto,7,Mon Jul 20 18:17:55 2015 UTC,"Lol. I love a good, justified rant. What your co-workers are doing is really obnoxious. I don't understand why people think they have the right to say such personal things to pregnant women or to touch our bodies. We don't become public property once we get pregnant. It's really dehumanizing and rude. A lot of people don't think before they speak. They don't understand the message they're sending when they open their mouths. What you look like is none of their business and it's just as rude to comment on your appearance now as it was before you were pregnant. I don't blame you for being fed up at all."
BabyBumps,3dxxbe,redsea18,4,Mon Jul 20 14:33:30 2015 UTC,Thank you! And then they ask me why I'm cranky! Well let's see I'm 6.5 months along and since the day I announced (I waited until just shy of 20 weeks for this reason) I get a comment every.single.morning from the same group of people. I am the most laid back person.. you can joke with me all day about inappropriate crap but this.. THIS bothers me. Don't comment on my personal appearance. And please tell me how I look pregnant. Are you referring to my gigantic boobs or my large ass or the cantaloup I'm smuggling under my stretchy shirt. I should ask specifics and make them uncomfortable. I'm sure that would just backfire though.
BabyBumps,3dxxbe,nicqui,4,Mon Jul 20 14:49:56 2015 UTC,"I'm a teacher and go back to work in a week and a half.  NOT looking forward to the comments.  It was bad enough when I saw these people every day - now that it's been a month, I'm going to be hearing about how ENORMOUS and GIGANTIC I am.  Thanks.  Thanks a lot people.  Because I don't already feel like a whale and I totally don't change my outfit 10 times each morning and cry because nothing fits.  The only acceptable thing to say to a pregnant woman is ""You look lovely/beautiful/great.""  That I can accept.  If you ask me ""Are you sure it's not twins?!"" I WILL PUNCH YOU."
BabyBumps,3dxxbe,gialives9,2,Mon Jul 20 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"I started saying ""my doctor says I'm measuring exactly how I should"" and a few people cut it out with the twins comments."

My favorite was when I was walking by someone's desk...minding my own business, and some chick stopped me to tell me how much my face is ""filling out."" Okay cool, thanks for calling me fat. Glad I asked (oh, but I didn't...)."
BabyBumps,3dxxbe,CommeCi_CommeCa,4,Mon Jul 20 21:46:53 2015 UTC,I got the face comment too!!!! Unless you were emaciated before being pregnant this is not a compliment!

Just wanted to let you know you're not alone!   I've been laying down after I poop and drinking some water, and it goes away somewhat quickly. I haven't called because it always goes away. I chalked it up to diarrhea or Braxton hicks, or a combo of both. If it was more frequent or consistent, I'd be a little more alarmed.   Are you feeling any better now after some time has passed?"

BabyBumps,3dyetl,amuhlou,8,Mon Jul 20 15:32:05 2015 UTC,"I got it today from another doctor- she's not even an OB or anything pregnancy related but because she sees pregnant women every week she KNOWS what I'm supposed to be measuring at 32w. She kept saying ""but you're so small are you sure you're gaining enough weight?""  Yes I'm small- I have massive hips that are tilted back that my baby hides in, he likes being posterior. I was also pretty athletic before getting pregnant so my belly is a little more restricted by muscle. Also I'm just small. Now thanks for your comment please direct me to the closest Dunkin."

BabyBumps,3dyetl,Dr_Vivaporu,6,Tue Jul 21 01:38:24 2015 UTC,I am exactly with you. Baby boy ha been measuring consistently a week behind and if one more flipping person tells me how tiny I am I'm gonna flip a lid.
BabyBumps,3dyetl,OriDoodle,6,Mon Jul 20 16:24:54 2015 UTC,I'm thinking you carrying small probably doesn't have much to do with the baby being a little on the smaller side. I look small for 33 weeks but my baby has consistently measured 4 weeks ahead (yikes.) I guess what I'm saying is you don't have to say anything about it if you don't want plus it's likely coincidental anyway.
BabyBumps,3dyetl,emsbaby,3,Mon Jul 20 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"that's true! I also carried a tad small with #1 but he measured fine (as far as I know). But since I have the tendency to carry small, people have the tendency to comment and I'm like 'yeah, don't remind me.'"
BabyBumps,3dyetl,Amy_MUA,4,Mon Jul 20 17:17:21 2015 UTC,"I carry big and in the front, if you look from behind my waist hip ratio is great, then you get to the front hoolllly smokes. Everyone looks at me like I'm about to drop down, squat and pop this baby out any second."
BabyBumps,3dyetl,Amy_MUA,2,Mon Jul 20 19:08:02 2015 UTC,Haha the visual you gave is great.  I carry small because all my weight gain goes right to my big hips and thighs instead. I'm also convinced I have a long torso which makes it much more roomy in there.
BabyBumps,3dyetl,letsjustbe,2,Mon Jul 20 19:36:12 2015 UTC,"Wide hips but short torso, the only way is... Out!!!  It is annoying how people judge the way you carry, a friend of mine carried small but she had a longer torso and her baby was nestled I there - I'd much rather that than me looking like a walrus, although it has its charms my tummy touches the steering wheel."
BabyBumps,3dyetl,Creepella_the_third,3,Tue Jul 21 07:45:46 2015 UTC,Same here. At each appointment the baby is measuring a little more behind. Not to mention I'm still three pounds down from my pre-pregnancy weight at 22.5 weeks even though I'm eating like crazy. The docs make it seem like it's not that big of a deal but seem more concerned each time. No fun! Good luck!
BabyBumps,3dyetl,Creepella_the_third,3,Mon Jul 20 16:37:45 2015 UTC,"I measured small. They harassed me about it at my doctors appointment constantly, but I knew we were fine. My baby was 8 lbs at birth. I honestly was expecting another 6 lb baby like my daughter. I have no idea where I put him because I did look small."
BabyBumps,3dyetl,Ks26739,3,Mon Jul 20 19:15:11 2015 UTC,"wow, that would be a shocker! A mom from my birth class when I was pregnant with #1 said she was consistently measuring really large and the doctors were concerned and pushing for induction etc. Even the growth ultrasound looked like baby was big. Baby came out perfectly healthy and less than 6#."
BabyBumps,3dyetl,Ks26739,3,Mon Jul 20 19:38:34 2015 UTC,I am glad I thought he was 6 lb. I had a vbac and it made it mentally easier thinking he was 6 lb. lol
BabyBumps,3dyetl,bagelsandkittens,3,Mon Jul 20 20:07:09 2015 UTC,"The average person commenting of a pregnant women isn't saying ""you look small!"" with concern. They are likely saying it to boost your confidence. Like damn girl you look awesome. Most people really have no idea how big or small a pregnant lady should be at any given time ya know?   I always measured a couple weeks smaller. Baby girl also measured small. We had an extra growth scan and NST the last couple weeks. Still measured small but otherwise was fine. She was born at 6.6 but was also 21 inches long!    My boss joked with me when I told him I was pregnant how I would get HUGE and be miserable and I was like, no way, I'm going to be dainty and lovely. Turns out I was right about the dainty part. Lol"
BabyBumps,3dyetl,ladycyberdemon23,2,Mon Jul 20 19:16:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would normally appreciate the comments as long as the docs seemed ok with it. So hopefully that will be the case after the growth scan!   Our first was 6lb 12oz and 20"" so he was kind of small but tall. Tiny head too which I have absolutely no complaints about lol."
BabyBumps,3dyetl,Freeryder_24,2,Mon Jul 20 19:33:59 2015 UTC,"My dr was really great about not getting me worked up or worried. Baby still measured a couple weeks off at the growth scan and she was like ""meh..she's not that far behind and our scans aren't totally spot on""  As far as I know, they don't get really concerned until baby appears to fall REALLY behind.  I should mention too that I gave birth a week LATE. Totally expecting an elephant baby (despite being small, lol) Dr. said there was nothing causing her to be so small and that I must just make small babies. One of those things I guess."
BabyBumps,3dyetl,seb4790,3,Mon Jul 20 19:48:47 2015 UTC,"Well I guess the good thing is at 37 weeks, there isn't a ton of time for her to fall that far behind. There's just always something to worry about. Irrational stuff like 'has my cup of coffee a day stunted her growth?!'"

I was just commenting to let you know though that when I started having contractions at 34 weeks, my office told me that once I hit 34 weeks, the fetal fibronectin (sp?) wasn't as accurate, so they don't do it. Also that if I went into labor, they wouldn't give baby steroids or try to stop my contractions besides giving me fluids, that it was just too much of a gray area as to whether those are actually helpful at that point."

BabyBumps,3e0za6,lakashhar,5,Tue Jul 21 03:01:28 2015 UTC,"The hospital should offer tours. Go on one. Give yourself a chance to warm up to the idea. Once I went on my tour, I realized I could see myself doing it there. It was way less clinical and hospital than I imagined. All of the medical equipment is hidden in the room. And unless I have an intervention (pitocin, epidural) I don't have to have an IV. Big jetted bathtubs. Mood lighting. All that jazz."
BabyBumps,3e0za6,jules0072,2,Tue Jul 21 03:10:44 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell all the equipment is behind a closet door, so I hopefully will be good there, but from my understanding they require the iv :( I'm going to see if they would be okay with putting the hook up in my arm, but not using the actual iv bag and such unless it becomes nessecery. I don't  know if they will be okay with that compromise or not though. I'll ask. Needles are fine...its all the equipment and the tubes and the wires that scare me."
BabyBumps,3e0za6,BumpQuestions,2,Tue Jul 21 03:32:41 2015 UTC,"This is the hep lock I mentioned, they probably require ""iv placement"" not necessarily an IV. I recommend you start making a list of questions and tick them off on the tour as you go- that's what we did and we found that it was extremely helpful! Though homey like I mentioned, our hospital does have a few pieces of equipment out in plain sight like a contraction monitor and the hookups for oxygen. But I don't see the hookups as scary equipment- you don't have to look at them anyways- bounce on your bouncy ball facing away or just let them fade into the background. Labor is so focus-demanding that you might not even have the opportunity to really notice them."
BabyBumps,3e0za6,SrslyYouToo,3,Tue Jul 21 04:09:59 2015 UTC,"I'd say meet with the OB and talk through your fears. Ask questions like will they do anything to calm you if you DO have an panic attack, like what would be their plan of action?  Does the hospital have any midwives that deliver at this birthing center?  If so I would also book an appointment with one of them.  I would make sure that you are very open about this situation and definitely keep an open dialog with your practitioner through your entire pregnancy.  Definitely tour this hospital and ask as many questions as you can."
BabyBumps,3e0za6,BumpQuestions,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:13:29 2015 UTC,"That's a good idea to ask. Knowing how they would handle that could provide some reassurance for me. I definitely plan on being upfront about it, and I'm lucky my friend knows the doctor so well, as she is happy to hold my hand as much as I need meeting him and all that."
BabyBumps,3e0za6,BumpQuestions,2,Tue Jul 21 03:28:16 2015 UTC,"The labor and delivery ward of our hospital didn't even feel like a hospital, it was great! They had those fake hardwood floors which look so real, unlike the gross white floors and stark lighting in the rest of the hospital. It really felt homey. I also don't have to be hooked up to anything at all- Just have to have a hep lock in place in case I do need to be hooked up at some point. These are not scary or overly intrusive, they actually can be very good things in the case of an emergency. I am delivering with a midwife at our hospital which is an awesome plus. Our hospital has zero ""away from baby"" time in a normal delivery- a parent can always be present everywhere baby goes. I think many hospitals these days are very understanding and some (like mine) are even encouraging of minimal intervention deliveries! We get to bring in our birthing ball, eat during labor, use the shower or tub, bed for husband is there, etc. It's not as institutionalized as it was many years ago. That doesn't mean it's right for EVERYONE, but it could be right for you!  The birth center at your hospital sounds really nice, I would definitely call them and go on a tour. There are tons of resources out there for questions to ask especially if you are really nervous and need some relaxation while there. You're right, 3k is a LOT of money for an extremely short-lived experience. Maybe a tour and talking with the staff will help you get over your fear, especially if you let them know well in advance that you are scared of the environment and ask questions about how they deal with the fear. Talk to your care providers too, or look for other women who have delivered at your hospital's birth center and ask about their experiences. If there's a local la leche league or some sort of breastfeeding support group, you could email them and ask if they have anyone who would be willing to speak with you.  Good luck!! You will make the right choice for yourself and your family."
BabyBumps,3e0za6,2ndstartotheright,2,Tue Jul 21 03:36:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That does sound a lot better than the image I have in my head. They have a tour available in about a month (they only do them on Sundays with 10 people at a time). My friend is gonna see if she can get anything earlier for me though as she knows the staff there personally. This hospital also has zero away from baby time, which made me feel much better, and will happily hand me my gloppy screaming child as soon as its out and breathing.   I don't think I will get over my fear, but I'm hopeful that we can make it seem enough like its not a scary hospital room that I will be okay. My image of hospitals is akin to alien abduction while being trapped around death and sickness. Its a pretty big priority of mine that my baby has an awesome pediatrician in hopes they don't have to deal with this in their life because its not the best phobia to have. I wish it at least made rational sense."
BabyBumps,3e0za6,crunchyfayetteville,2,Tue Jul 21 03:56:37 2015 UTC,"No it's not irrational to feel that way. Hospitals are terrifying especially if you spent any significant time in one. My husband spent three months straight in one at age 12, another month before 12 and another at 14. He hates them, he won't even go to the doctor when he's sick without a huge fuss because he's scared he will end up back at the hospital again. When you have crappy experiences or crappy perceptions it makes it that big scary death machine. But he was comfortable in the labor wing, it really is a different place. I hope you will feel more comfortable after your tour and can make the best choice for your family after that. You'll do the right thing for you all, that's for sure. In the mean time relax, you have plenty of time to be worried about things, don't start until it's totally necessary :)"
BabyBumps,3e0za6,crunchyfayetteville,2,Tue Jul 21 04:06:49 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, this is a very small sample size, but 4 out of the 6 home birth moms I know personally wound up in the hospital due to complications during or after at least one of their labors. I'm not sure what reliable resources there are for more widespread statistics, but it seems worth considering if it would be worse to you to plan to work through the anxiety around hospitals from the get go (with the benefit of saving money) or to possibly be faced with it suddenly down the line. I'm guessing odds are good you and your baby would have no reason to go, but how awful if you were out $3000 and had to go anyway?  I hope you find a way to have a comfortable, peaceful birth, wherever it winds up happening!"
BabyBumps,3e0za6,joyful5678,2,Tue Jul 21 04:10:08 2015 UTC,"I may be outside of my advice realm here but have you discussed this with local midwives? I know in our area, midwives are very willing to work with you on what you can afford...setting up a payment plan or even discounting your rate. I'd encourage you to go that route if that is where you're most comfortable. Be transparent with them during the interview process and see what they say!"
BabyBumps,3e0za6,laurenkk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:17:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, I had an interview and found a great midwife, and that was going to be our plan. Unfortunately everything must be paid in full by 34 weeks, and she will only knock $100 off the price for paying cash. I want it to be okay and we could find a way to afford it, but 3k is more than I spent on my car. I feel obscenely selfish for wanting to do such an expensive option when I qualify for free care."
BabyBumps,3e0za6,kiwi1855,2,Tue Jul 21 04:59:05 2015 UTC,"Do not feel selfish!! This is the birth of your child. I understand where you're coming from. My midwife was around the same plus I had to pay for labs out of pocket (not included in my midwife's fee...). I had private insurance but they didn't pay for a home birth midwife. It wouldn't have been free if I went to the hospital for delivery versus using a midwife, but it would have been about the same. Hoping you have a wonderful birthday experience, whichever route you take!"
BabyBumps,3e0za6,bagelsandkittens,2,Tue Jul 21 05:47:08 2015 UTC,"Whatever you decide know that taking care of your own mental health is not selfish.  I too have been dreaming about home birth for years and have had major hospital anxiety that most outsiders think is silly.  It's hard to explain without having lived my history but it is also very real so you're not alone there. And for low risk pregnancy the statistics on home birth safety are very much in your favor.  Are there any sliding scale midwives in your area?   A doula is a great idea if you need to be in a hospital and would cost less...and more of them have sliding scale options especially the newer ones.  I think they lower cs rates by 40% or so and knowing tjat might help w the anxiety.  Can you find an ob that ""gets"" it and will work with your anxiety? I was referred to one for a consult as backup and I could tell she'd be great to work w if the need arose. She told me of taking patients w birth trauma histories into the OR on advance to help them overcome their fears. It seemed very compassionate and patient.  I still hope it doesn't come to that of course but knowing the option is there took a ton of stress away.  If you do end up choosing to birth in the hospital...exposure can help a lot.  I ended up admitted unexpectedly at 21+6 and after a cerclage was placed and I spent three days in bed there I now feel less terrified of needing to possibly deliver there if baby comes early or I have other complications.  I'm still working hard to go full term and birth at home but it's at least a less scary possibility. Having had so many appointments there during pregnancy has also made the space itself easier to be in.  Good luck. :)"
BabyBumps,3e014r,alwaystryharder,4,Mon Jul 20 22:25:09 2015 UTC,I have anterior placenta BUT I have never had a day where I don't feel baby. Sometimes it can just be a calmer type of day ya know? Just as long as you get 6 kicks in two hours you should be alright. If not you should get looked at! It never hurts.
BabyBumps,3e014r,alycenwonder,3,Tue Jul 21 00:47:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, of course as soon as I posted this and ate dinner he got active and has been active since! He did 10 kicks in 5 min... So think we are okay, but I'm still going to ask :)"

BabyBumps,3e014r,UnicornToots,2,Mon Jul 20 22:35:39 2015 UTC,It feels terrible... Sometimes I feel like I need to support the bottom of my belly to get any relief. Getting up from sitting and moving sometimes is all I need to trigger really bad pain around my groin and on the sides of the bottom of my belly.
BabyBumps,3e014r,atasteofhappiness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:27 2015 UTC,"I'm nearly 33 weeks and yesterday I was freaking out all day because baby wasn't moving very much. Well today he or she made up for lost time! I spent my morning commute and the first hour at work experiencing the most violent kicks ever, paired with cervical punches/cramps/something awful/scratching maybe? It was insane.   If he or she wouldn't have moved today, I'd have called my OB. If you're at all confused or concerns, by all means give them a call. You won't be laughed at for it!"
BabyBumps,3e014r,atasteofhappiness,2,Mon Jul 20 23:04:24 2015 UTC,I see my ob on Wednesday so I'll ask then. He 'passed' today and I've felt a few hard kicks since then!  But yeah the violent kicks are terrible!!
BabyBumps,3e014r,atasteofhappiness,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:16:49 2015 UTC,"You mentioned kick counts ""this morning"" - does morning tend to be his most active time?  I found with both this and my first pregnancy that I can only do kick counts consistently in the evening - that's when my babies tend to be constantly moving.  Maybe try a different time of day?  My placenta is also anterior."
BabyBumps,3e014r,bagelsandkittens,2,Mon Jul 20 23:11:05 2015 UTC,Morning and evening tend to be active times. But sometimes it varies. Some days he is active all day except the evening... So that's why I get confused about when to do them...
BabyBumps,3e0dz2,princesspopcorn,2,Tue Jul 21 00:06:36 2015 UTC,I'm waiting until Amazon cyber monday sales. We got such  good deals on upgrades for our son it only seems to make sense for us to wait again. The only thing we may get earlier is a car seat just incase little missy comes sooner than expected.
BabyBumps,3e0dz2,confusedasalways,2,Tue Jul 21 03:10:32 2015 UTC,I actually just returned that stroller. It was a huge pain in the ass to fold and even worse to open up. One-handed storage? Bullshit!
BabyBumps,3e0dz2,UnicornToots,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:20:33 2015 UTC,"Just as a suggestion for stroller and car seat shopping. Even though there might be some really good deals out there, make sure to try them out first. By that I mean, fold and close it, carry it around or lift it, etc. Like the person above mentioned, some are a huge pain to work with even though they might have a good price tag. A good stroller doesn't have to be 300 dollars but it shouldn't be a hassle to work with either."
BabyBumps,3e0dz2,WhiteRushin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:00:00 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on the good clearance deals! I told my mom about it and she found one of those 4 in 1 cribs, that grow with the child. Not sure the original price but it was marked down to $115. She wanted to buy it but feels it's too soon, I'm 10+1. I'll need it eventually but maybe it IS too soon."
BabyBumps,3dzmxc,FoxyMissRoxy,13,Mon Jul 20 20:42:47 2015 UTC,Stripping membranes wont make baby come if she's not ready.  Might wanna explain that to your mom.
BabyBumps,3dzmxc,MaeBeWeird,11,Mon Jul 20 20:55:35 2015 UTC,"Don't feel guilty.  Your doctor knows what is best medically for you and your baby, not your mom."
BabyBumps,3dzmxc,BananaBoggle,4,Mon Jul 20 20:51:31 2015 UTC,"Pack your bags, you're going on a guilt-trip! Moms are good for this kind of bullshit. Tell her its not a spectator sport, and you do not need the extra stress right now. It might seem harsh, but she'll get over it fine once the baby is here. <3"
BabyBumps,3dzmxc,traininthedistance,3,Mon Jul 20 23:31:27 2015 UTC,"I know honesty is usually the best policy ... but if I were you, I'd probably get the membrane strip anyway, but tell my mum I'd decided against it. If it doesn't work, no harm done - if it does work, then obviously your body was ready for labour - you can't necessarily prove it was the membrane strip that started it!"
BabyBumps,3dzmxc,sestrasestra,4,Tue Jul 21 01:33:30 2015 UTC,May I ask why you are considering it at this juncture?
BabyBumps,3dzmxc,Trexy,5,Mon Jul 20 21:30:46 2015 UTC,"Just to speed things along possibly I think. I am leaking fluid and am looking at being induced on my due date anyways, and I REALLY REALLY REALLY don't want to be induced, so he suggested this as a way to perhaps move things along."
BabyBumps,3dzmxc,emsbaby,2,Mon Jul 20 21:50:55 2015 UTC,I'm in a similar boat. I never wanted to have my membranes stripped (mostly because I didn't think it works unless you're ready to go anyway.) But they don't want me going past 39 weeks so I think I'll probably take the chance that it might get things rolling.
BabyBumps,3dzmxc,PrimrosePlath,2,Mon Jul 20 22:51:35 2015 UTC,"I don't mind advice- but my mom is the type to give it when she has no clue what she's talking about - in these times I always make it a point to ask her where she did her residency, did her post-doc work, etc - depending on the type of advice she's giving. Usually gets the point across, but I'm a jerk. I feel your pain, but your doctor is the one who knows what's going on with you, so no need to feel guilty."
BabyBumps,3dzmxc,BumpQuestions,2,Tue Jul 21 01:18:10 2015 UTC,"Ask your mom if she would come watch your pap smear or colonoscopy if you weren't pregnant. Because a membrane sweep doesn't mean anything when it comes to labor, it has the potential to help labor start but it's not like a chemical induction. We see stories all the time from women who had their membranes stripped 3 times and didn't go into labor."
BabyBumps,3dzmxc,SmartyMcSmartyPants,2,Tue Jul 21 02:09:46 2015 UTC,I had my membranes stripped with both of my prior pregnancies between 38 and 39 weeks.  With them I was ~60-70% effaced and 4cm dilated...it did nothing.  My oldest waited until her due date and my youngest the day before.  It is definitely not pregnancy inducing!  Your baby will come when he/she is ready should you choose to strip the membranes.  :)

BabyBumps,3dzpy2,am1986,3,Mon Jul 20 23:49:56 2015 UTC,Years ago I had a swollen lymph node in my armpit. It was painful and eventually started to ooze. I ended up having to go on antibiotics because it was infected and then removed. I have had other swollen lymph nodes but they usually resolve on there own.  Check with your doctor and make sure that everything is ok. I'm sure everything is fine but it is better to have it looked at.
BabyBumps,3dzpy2,mamakat415,2,Tue Jul 21 03:13:11 2015 UTC,I noticed a few lumps in my armpits after my second.Mentioned it to the midwife and she said it's just hormones and not to worry.She said something along the lines of if they don't disappear in a couple of months mention it again.She wasn't concerned and they disappeared once my hormones chilled out.I didn't breastfeed though so I don't know if this made a difference to how quickly they went.Got a couple after #3 too but again they disappeared pretty quickly :D

If there is a fire that causes damage to our condos, we are responsible for all the damages.  Our neighbors washer was leaking into the downstairs neighbors garage and they paid for the damages.

It's specifically there to deal with issues from shared walls/utility lines, etc.  I know it's awful to deal with, but it will get dealt with and hopefully the insurance is good about remedying everything quickly.  I hear you on the condo hate, though... We live in a condo and while it's good most of the time, there are moments that make me want to sell and never look back."

My biggest fear is that I'll still be here,in this most awkward of situations,when labour starts,and my ex will be completely useless and unhelpful (we both decided he'd be my birth partner but I'm worried about it) I'm excited to be a mom! I'm excited to meet this little totally-new person we created!! I'm really looking forward to not having to live with my ex and work every little thing out with him..basically,to be the head of my own household again! Bit worried about being a single mom,but my parents split when I was 14 so I know it's not as tough as I might've thought.

BabyBumps,3dzrey,jennimr,2,Mon Jul 20 22:54:25 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of on the fence. I was casually seeing my SO for a couple of months and he was pretty supportive in the early days.  However, when it hit 20 weeks and he hadn't told his family yet, I kind of pulled away. I moved back to my hometown about a month ago to be closer to my parents, and prior to moving, he was promising up and down that he was moving with me. Then it turned into I'll move there a couple of months after you.  Now, I'm 26 weeks tomorrow and he still hasn't told his parents or made any sort of advance in the plans to move here. It's only about 6.5 hours away, and I know he's anxious and freaking out but it just seems less and less likely that he'll end up coming out.  Like you, I have a lot of support here, though, so I'm glad I moved! I don't drive and our public transportation is much more limited than I'm used to so I'm mostly scared that I'll feel stuck and get depressed. I'm also pretty stressed about finances.  I'm super excited to meet my little girl, though! Excited for baby cuddles and learning right along with her. I'm excited that I no longer have to live with roommates, that I'll be the head of the household. I'm looking forward to a much more structured life than I'm used to.

According to my doctors/anesthesiologist, they want a platelet count of 100 in order to do an epidural. Some will dip down to 80. Mine were 76. All that meant was that I had to do it without the meds! No other complications, unless you count some tearing. My only advice to you is that this is going to be super painful for her (especially if she can't have an epidural), so be super nice and wonderful and supportive! Pitocin contractions are no joke!

This third and final I will have my husband home, but I am kind worried about getting sick of him being here... so...    My tips for you:  Do not be afraid to PUT THE BABY DOWN. I see so many new moms who even pee holding their babies because they feel guilty putting them down... its ok to drop them in a swing or bouncy seat.  You deserve to pee hands free damnit!   Dont forget to eat, like seriously... You will feel like total junk if you do.    If you are breastfeeding, set up a breastfeeding station where you plan on doing that, things to include:  WATER... I can not stress this enough, the second that baby latches you will have never been so damn thirsty in your damn life.  The REMOTE if you are near the TV, your computer, tablet or phone, nursing can be extremely boring, and snacks for those days when the baby just wants to eat for an hour and you forgot to eat again...   Make sure you husband knows your expectations for when he gets home from work.  Gone are the days of ""I just need to relax for an hour before engaging with you""  He needs to know that until shit calms down he will be 100% ON the second he walks in the door... I mean, he gets to pee if he has to and get a drink but thats it man, thats it.   Decided ahead of time if you are going to have him get up in the night with you or not.  I personally did not have my husband get up because he works sometimes 70 hours a week and I was nursing.  HOWEVER, he must understand that there will be exceptions to this rule.  Finding yourself crying hysterically in the corner in the middle of the night with a screaming baby is not an unheard of thing... make sure he knows that even though he has to work now is the time to step up and grab that kid and let you get some sleep.   I say this a lot on this sub because it was the best piece of advice I have ever heard from a nurse.  This woman was in her 60's, and she was sitting in my hospital room with us late one night just chatting and she looked my husband dead in the eye and said ""There WILL be a point where she will start to cry, do her, yourself and that baby a favor and take that baby and let her sleep""    There was one night where my husband woke to me sobbing, like ugly cry sobbing, because the baby had been nursing for 3 hours in the middle of the night and I was desperately looking for a pacifier like a crazy person.  He looked at me, picked up the baby and sent me to bed, he said he found the pacifier and the baby stopped crying and they hung out for 2 hours while I slept until he needed to eat again.  It was exactly what I needed... it was 2am... he did in fact, have to work the next day.  He was amazing."

I am SO glad my boss doesn't care when I'm gone for appointments or for how long. If the work is getting done he's cool."

BabyBumps,3dz9di,momonomicon,4,Mon Jul 20 19:30:05 2015 UTC,"Did he speak to his boss about some flexibility? Perhaps working from home, doing 4 hours, coming home for a while, doing the rest later, that kind of thing? I don't know if it's possible buy maybe they'd help?"

BabyBumps,3dz9di,baby_ham,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:32:03 2015 UTC,I was going to say the same thing. Game studios expect you to work 12 hour days and don't give a F if you have a family.
BabyBumps,3dz9di,knittybynature,3,Tue Jul 21 03:40:19 2015 UTC,"Frozen meals, easy nutritious snacks, and easy access to water. I recommend getting the biggest water bottle you can find.   It's definitely manageable. My biggest concern would be if you are sore or have any mobility issues (you might if you have a c section). If that is the case, then you probably want someone there with you for a week or so.   Can your husband ask of he can work from home at all for a few weeks? My husband is a programmer, and he was able to after he went back."
BabyBumps,3dz9di,nicqui,3,Mon Jul 20 20:13:46 2015 UTC,I'm coming here for the tips and encouragement. We aren't sure of what my hubby's leave is going to be (trying to send emails to HR) but he won't have a lot of vacation left so I may be by myself quite a bit. My friend has offered to come stay with me for two weeks which will be incredibly helpful (she is the type that will cook/do dishes/stay out of the way if necessary. I never feel like I have to host her). I'm just not sure exactly when to have her come because baby can be here anytime up to 2 weeks before or after my due date. (She's flying across the country so we have to have dates set soonish). I feel like there's so many unplanable variables that make it difficult to know when to have her here. :/
BabyBumps,3dz9di,knittybynature,2,Mon Jul 20 21:32:43 2015 UTC,"My husband has no leave, either.  I'm hoping that he can at least work from home or take a few days just to help us get situated.  We definitely can't afford any unpaid time off for him."

BabyBumps,3dy7tg,onacloudyday,11,Mon Jul 20 14:39:36 2015 UTC,"I know there are meds for a lot of mental disorders out there that are pregnancy safe. There isn't anything they can give you at all?  On the note of wanting to move out- If you were in a perfectly happy and healthy relationship before stopping your meds, perhaps explain to him what not being on them is doing to you, and that you feel you should be around your family who knows how to handle you when you aren't on them. Try to put into words how you felt before you went off them, reassure him you're not abandoning him- you just need to get through the pregnancy! As soon as baby is born you can go back on your medications. Perhaps with a little space you'll even start to stabilize as the pregnancy progresses and you can visit him. If he is in this for the long haul with you he will be understanding and give you your space, but don't abandon him. You are totally aware that everything was dandy before you had to stop meds- and so you know that it can be that way again. :)"
BabyBumps,3dy7tg,cartoonhero42,3,Mon Jul 20 15:05:14 2015 UTC,I agree! You're also going through the roughest part of the pregnancy right now where you're not used to the crazy hormones and changing body. None of that is helping! At 10w all I wanted to do was sleep and did not want my husband to touch me at all and I'm not bipolar. My temper was very short too because of everything happening. You're going through a huge change and it's pretty amazing that you're aware of it all.
BabyBumps,3dy7tg,Tesalin,2,Mon Jul 20 15:28:21 2015 UTC,"I second that! I am only 5 1/2 weeks but already my hormones are making a huge difference in my mood. My husband has been fantastic and I love him so much but most of the time in the last week I can't stand him. His words, his actions, his touch all make me squirm uncomfortably. It doesn't help that I feel miserable. That all comes with the territory and it is so magnified for you because of your withdrawal from medication. Don't give up!"
BabyBumps,3dy7tg,jjohnson13112,7,Tue Jul 21 12:26:37 2015 UTC,Thank you :)
BabyBumps,3dy7tg,sparklekitteh,5,Mon Jul 20 15:15:59 2015 UTC,"I have bipolar II. Going completely off meds was NOT an option for me, so I made that clear with my psychiatrist. Several are less risky for pregnancy than others, especially if you take a lower dose (or none at all) during the first trimester.  I'm on Lamictal, which is considered one of the ""safest"" as far as mood stabilizers go. One study showed an increased rate of cleft lip/cleft palate, but other studies have shown no increased risk. Cleft is something that can be fixed with surgery, and we decided that was something we could deal with since keeping my mental health stable was most important.  There are also several antidepressants that fall into a similar category. I'm on Lexapro, which is working well, and I've heard that Wellbutrin is a low-risk as well. (Though some folks with bipolar, myself included, can go a bit manic at higher doses.) The issue with SSRI's is that the baby can have a bit of withdrawal after birth, being a bit more irritable and sleepy than normal, but that's something you can deal with too.  Feel free to PM if you want to chat, I'm happy to help if I can :)"
BabyBumps,3dy7tg,ADHDprofessional,5,Mon Jul 20 15:49:33 2015 UTC,I'm agreeing with all the other ladies. Please get a second opinion and go back on a pregnancy safe mood stabilizer. It is VERY dangerous to be off medications with bipolar disorder. I don't mean to scare you but unmedicated peripartum and postpartum bipolar is exceptionally unsafe for you and your baby. This is what leads to those horror stories of women losing touch with reality and harming their children. Please talk to a doctor or psychiatrist who specializes in women's issues so they can prescribe a pregnancy safe medication.
BabyBumps,3dy7tg,ireallylikesculpture,2,Mon Jul 20 16:03:01 2015 UTC,"A successful relationship is about sharing both the good and the bad. A real turning point for me in my mental health recovery was opening up about it to my partner..like all the gory details. You said you don't want him to see you in a full blown episode, but if its not him then who is? Because somebody someday will have to, and shutting yourself away in your mums basement is only running away from the inevitable, you have to let someone in on your vunurability eventually, which is hard, I should know. It might be that you are projecting negative feelings towards your SO because you dont want to justify opening up to him but if your partner is worth his salt he'll stick around and give you the space and support you need to start getting better. Best of luck."
BabyBumps,3dy7tg,sparklekitteh,7,Mon Jul 20 16:52:03 2015 UTC,"Excellent point! If anybody's going to be there for you during an episode, it's hopefully your SO. Opening up can be scary, but that's how you'll get help."
BabyBumps,3dy7tg,graceepoche,3,Mon Jul 20 18:24:18 2015 UTC,"FIrst off, congratulations!   Secondly, I would definitely get a second opinion on pregnancy safe meds, they're out there! Also you might not agree, but it sounds like the only reason you're no longer interested in your boyfriend and apartment is because you went off your meds. You should probably talk to someone, a medical professional, about this. Bipolar disorder has a way of making you think things that are not reflective of who you are. I would know, I'm type II bipolar, rapid cycling, and I've gone through more than one ""i absolutely hate and want to kill my partner"" stages in the past. Best of luck to you, seriously. Keep us updated on how things are going."
BabyBumps,3dy7tg,snailien,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:31:54 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I'm 25+6 and bipolar type 1! I've often experienced the feelings you described, but I lucked out because the pregnancy hormones have mostly stabilized my moods. I couldn't imagine dealing with that on top of all the pregnancy stuff, I'm so sorry. :(   When I first started my OB appointments, my doctor said that for many pregnant women with mental illness, the reward far outweighs the risk when it comes to meds. If I recall correctly, most bipolar moms are recommended to stay only on a mood stabilizer through pregnancy, but I assume if you're type 2 an anti-depressant as well. I've seen moms here and elsewhere who remained on Zoloft through pregnancy. I was on Lamictal, Lexipro, Adderall and Ativan pre-pregnancy, and my psychiatrist said that Lamictal was probably the safest/best option for pregnant women because it has anti-depressant qualities as well. I'm not sure if that recommendation would be the same for you, though.  If I was in your position, I'd talk to my OB or a prenatal psychiatrist about going back on at least some form of meds for the remainder of your pregnancy. Even if it's less than you were on before or a different combo, it's worth a shot. You're almost in your second trimester, so the risk dramatically decreases and you'll at least have a break for a little while and be set up for postpartum.  Hope this helps a little bit! XO"

I am exhausted after every meal unless it's a light snack (and I've never really been much of a snacker). I don't know if it's because everything is so jam packed in there and squished or if it's a digestion issue but I can't wait to have my old appetite and (hopefully) metabolism back.

If anyone gets annoyed by it I tell them it's an arbitrary date in the middle of the four week period that babies are expected and only 4% of babies are actually born on that date.

I did get a second opinion about my pelvis and without examining me they basically said oh we'll probably induce and let you try natural for a while first.

Pediatrician said she didn't look overdue at all, she was right on time. She mentioned something about overdue babies having really peely skin or something. So yah, due dates from LMP aren't always accurate. You may have ovulated later than is typical in your cycle. Also, my OB wanted to schedule an induction for 41 weeks because that's their standard procedure . I said I wanted to wait until 42 weeks and they were fine with that but had me do extra monitoring/tests. So don't feel pressured into an induction if you don't want one."

BabyBumps,3dz166,laurenzobe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:50:35 2015 UTC,You'd probably only be able to use if before your due date if your doctor will indicate that your pregnancy is enough to qualify you for disability.  My doctor's office has a sign that specifically warns that non-complicated pregnancies are not a disability.

BabyBumps,3dz166,bluesky557,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:17:13 2015 UTC,"I work in health care, I deal with FMLA a lot. The only thing FMLA guarantees you is that you cannot be replaced while you are under FMLA. Your job cannot fire you and hire someone else simply because you are dealing with personal or family medical issues. FMLA does not guarantee pay at all. Your short term disability leave is different - this is a benefit provided by your employer (and is not a requirement for them to carry). Most STDL plans require you use some PTO first - mine is 1/3 of your accrued PTO hours, some are 100% of your PTO time, etc. STDL also accrues differently based on employer. Mine is 1.84 hours per 80 hour pay period. I have been at my job for 3 years the day I am due and will have 3 and half weeks of STDL. It sounds like yours is a standard amount (5 weeks) with a week of PTO/sick leave first.   Hopefully that helps explain it."
BabyBumps,3dz166,Chinasun04,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:34:12 2015 UTC,This is common and is actually part of FMLA--your employer can require you to use up all your sick and vacation days before taking any kind of other leave.
BabyBumps,3dz166,jlynnbizatch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:34:20 2015 UTC,"I worked for 2.5 years in disability benefits. You are mostly correct that if you have a one week elimination period (what you are referring to as a waiting period) and you date of disability is considered to be your due date, yes you'd get paid the 5 weeks. HOWEVER, if you are written off work a wee km before (maybe you're swelling or back is hurting or whatever and your doc is willing to go ahead and give you an out of work note / restrictions) then that date would be your date of disability and would begin that 1 week waiting period thus, you'd get the full 6 weeks post partum. Does that make sense? Feel free to ask me more."

Though that is a wide range of years, I think the bottom line is that there isn't any need for them, rather than aesthetics, so its best to leave them out. I  did register for a breathable mesh one however. I think the consensus these days is to leave baby with as little in the crib as possible.   http://www.parenting.com/article/sids-prevention"
BabyBumps,3dyir9,DTJB0510,5,Mon Jul 20 16:09:07 2015 UTC,I was just reading about crib bumpers on Lucie's List. Her recommendation is to use breathable ones for babies 5mon+: http://admin.lucieslist.com/crib-bumpers
BabyBumps,3dyir9,questionablecake,3,Mon Jul 20 20:40:06 2015 UTC,"We have used breathable bumpers like those with our baby who is now a toddler. A couple things about them:  Initially I slid them about half way down so that they only peek up above the mattress. I did this because without the bumper her pacifier kept falling out of the crib.  When she got a bit bigger I pulled them up higher but still kept about a quarter of the bumper below the mattress. I did this because she was able to stick her leg under the bumper and through the crib slats and her leg was stuck.  When she was even older, around 18 months, I once again pulled hem about halfway down because she was trying to stand up on them. They do slide down if she tried to stand on them, buuuut.. It seemed better to be more cautious.  This worked very well for us with the toddler and we will do the same thing with this next beanie baby. :)"

For the first while he'll have no bumper, but when he gets older and squirmy, rolling over and moving around and such, the bumper will be going back up because from what I understand there is a WAY greater chance of them getting an arm or leg stuck in the crib slats and somewhat hurting themselves than suffocating on a bumper at that age.

BabyBumps,3dza6g,Bmorehon,4,Mon Jul 20 19:27:47 2015 UTC,"I worked in an upscale lingerie boutique for about 6 months and can confirm: 90% of our first time clients were wearing the wrong size bra. SO many of them came back, even though our stuff was expensive, because of how much more comfortable they were once they found the right size. Since becoming pregnant, finding a bra that fits has become impossible though. And I will say that if you've been wearing the wrong size for 10 years, the 'right' size is going to feel weird/uncomfortable for the first little bit. For me it was around 3 weeks before it felt right, so that is something to keep in mind! If you're buying quality bras that fit properly and you're washing them properly, most women only need 3 bras in their stash."
BabyBumps,3dza6g,phoenix0r,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:59 2015 UTC,What is the most common ways people's bras don't fit? Too small around the bust/cup?
BabyBumps,3dza6g,Bmorehon,2,Tue Jul 21 07:25:51 2015 UTC,"It's usually both and it depends on the size of a woman. For instance, many slim women with bigger busts go for a smaller band and larger cups like the 34D (Dont know why but this is like some sort of magic number) and they usually need a 36C. Where as larger women go for a smaller band size and smaller cup than they need because they feel like they are getting support. I'm sure that r/abrathatfits has more info but basically you want the center section to lay flat against your breast bone, no gaps (which feels weird at first!) and you want your band to fit at the same line all the way around your back instead of riding up your back. For me it took several weeks for my backfat to get used to the new position of my band lol. I'm also breaking all the rules right now as far as a well-fit bra goes but with my boobs being different sizes from day to day I can't really keep up."

BabyBumps,3dy4km,septicidal,3,Mon Jul 20 15:12:25 2015 UTC,"Talk to your OB and see if they can help refer you to a perinatal psychiatrist.  They can help evaluate you properly and discuss what treatment options will be most appropriate.  The important thing is to address it as early as possible because depression/anxiety/other mood issues can have negative effects on pregnancy and can worsen after giving birth.  I was on a safer-for-pregnancy antidepressant prior to conceiving and have stayed on it with the guidance of my OB and psychiatrist.  The perinatal psychiatrist was also able to prescribe an anxiety medication, to take as-needed, if I have anxiety attacks during pregnancy.  My anxiety got really bad in early pregnancy but I also had to go off the anxiety medication I had been on prior to pregnancy, which can have a rebound effect.  One thing my perinatal psychiatrist has told me, over and over, is that depression and anxiety are actually very common in pregnancy, it's just taboo in our society to talk about it because historically society expects pregnancy to be a happy time.  But the brain is trying to cope with massively fluctuating hormones and other bodily changes, and in some people that triggers mood issues.  The best thing you can do for yourself, your growing baby, and the rest of your family is to find good support resources and use them as much as you need."
BabyBumps,3dy4km,jamnscones,3,Mon Jul 20 15:09:58 2015 UTC,"Pre-pregnancy I was seeing a counsellor for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to help me manage low mood and depression, and I'll continue to see them throughout my pregnancy and postpartum too. What has helped me is breathing/relaxation techniques, and also talking with someone who could help me work out what triggered my low mood. I'm in the UK so I had access through my GP, but there is stuff available online too, just google CBT. I hope you can find something or someone that can help you :) feeling low is really difficult, but asking for help is a really important step. Also, forgive yourself! I spent ages making myself worse because I blamed myself for not being able to cope, but in fact I was doing fine, and I'm sure you are too. Hugs x"
BabyBumps,3dy4km,honeydee,2,Mon Jul 20 16:54:59 2015 UTC,"Currently dealing with antenatal depression. It's horrible. It's caused my mom and I to fight about my childhood, my step-sisters and a whole lot more. I've been exhausted more often and have to force myself out of the house some days.  What helps me is exercising. Even when I don't want to. Pregnancy yoga is the biggest helper. Or I'll go for a long walk.   Right now, I'm looking for a therapist in my area so I can speak about it with a professional. I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety 10 years ago so I already know the drill when it comes to depression. Shit sucks. You can't take the necessary medication to level out your moods so, speaking to someone, anyone, helps.  Bottom line, my advice would be to exercise more. Wear your brain out. Or speak with a professional or your boyfriend to get it out more.   Don't go through this alone, it only makes it worse. It took me forever to talk about it with my husband, but now I'm doing better."

BabyBumps,3dy4km,lovemeatmyworstbrook,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:07:14 2015 UTC,"I also get extremely lonely sometimes. My boyfriend will be playing video games and relaxing after a stressful day, which I really don't mind. But something inside me makes me start thinking about how lonely I am sitting on the couch watching Netflix by myself.   I suggest you let your boyfriend know you feel this way sometimes. Just ask for half an hour of his time for a hug and some company. Put it as you did here and it's clear you're not telling him off or anything, you just need a little extra affection.  I don't have anything as bad as you but I have my down days where I feel so empty inside or angry or upset with everything. Just half an hour with my husband like over lunch or whatever, no TV or other distractions, often makes a huge difference. Sometimes in the evening he's busy so I just find things to keep myself busy or chat to people on irc/facebook so I'm not too demanding.  I think overall you probably need something more than that, I'm saying this as one little thing that may help, not some magical cure. But do bare in mind that depression is a bit of a monster, so if you still feel lonely anyway don't panic or make yourself feel guilty. It's, unfortunately, another symptom.   I think it goes without saying that I also think you should bring it up with your doctors. Make it clear how badly it's affecting you, don't let them brush you off if they don't seem to get it. You may not want medication but you should consider it and research anything offered before turning it down. Yes some things are not ideal but when weighing up the true risks vs benefit, sometimes medications are worth it.  Edit: I saw the comments about therapy, which I always forget because I didn't go that route myself. Obviously a viable option that is also good to research and consider!"
BabyBumps,3dy4km,Pinkindabrain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:55:58 2015 UTC,I've already let him know. He is understanding about it and usually gives me the time I need.

When I had spotting I called my midwife. She reassured me, ordered an early ultrasound and sent me in for a rhogam shot. If you have a negative blood type I would call your OB office. Rhogam keeps mom's negative blood cells from attacking baby's positive blood cells. Since I am O- and my husband is A+ our babe is most likely positive.

Just this morning I had to say good bye to string cheese. Eggs, apples, cheese, chicken, seafood, pancakes, and the list goes on and on I can't even look at without gagging. Hoping it gets better!

I cant handle chewing a whole piece of meat. Gross And fish is still right out.   You really don't need a ton of protein (I think around 71g and I'm managing it, it sounds like we have similar issues too) and vegetable and grain sources are perfectly fine (vegans and vegetarians do just peachy without meat/dairy). If you are okay with veggies, try steamed and salted Edamame (soya) bean pods. I ate a lot of frozen peas as well. They are both great sources of protein. It depends on your food aversions though. I call oatmeal my gateway food-if I can eat that I can try something else. I add hemp seeds to my oatmeal. A cup of skim milk has like 8g of protein as well, I can't eat yogurt or cheeses anymore :( but a glass of milk or a scoop of ice cream are okay Chickpeas (or hummus) and brown rice make a complete protein. Eggs sit okay with me some days, usually scrambled. Hopefully it passes. I would not force yourself to eat meat if it grosses you out, it could cause a lifelong dislike."

It's not quite as personal as writing letter by hand, and I considered doing that and putting everything in a scrapbook, but I know myself and I'm a LOT more likely to just type something up or send a pic from my phone than I am to print a picture out and write a letter!"

If I felt like gagging or throwing up I went up or down a floor into a bathroom where it was less likely I would run into someone from my department. -Drank decaf tea out of my coffee mug or carried around a water bottle. -Always carried a notebook, which I usually held in front of my stomach. -Wore lots of dresses that were looser or tops with cardigans, to hide the bloat (and let me tell you there was serious bloat). -As far as fatigue, I didn't do anything other than power through but my best tips for this are to get up and walk around; leave a meeting to go to the bathroom and splash cold water on your face if you need to; chew gum or suck on mints.  My friend used to take a nap in her car over her lunch break to get through the day.  I didn't really have a reason for hiding it except I just wanted to--I didn't want to be the talk of the office especially until the first trimester was past.  I will say, however, that I felt like EVERYONE knew; I thought it was written on my face; it seemed like people were making comments left and right that insinuated something (""Oh, I craved Sprite so bad when I was pregnant!"" as I'm drinking Sprite; ""You look different today!"")  but later on when I told those people they were all totally shocked!"

BabyBumps,3dz3h8,snuglasfur,2,Mon Jul 20 18:24:48 2015 UTC,"The Quadruple Marker Test (or ""quad screening"") measures the levels of Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), HCG, Estriol, and Inhibin A in your blood to determine your risk for having a baby with certain chromosomal defects:   Down syndrome (trisomy 21). Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) Spina bifida Anencephaly   You blood risk is just that - a risk, it is not a positive or a negative result.  The Harmony and MaterniT21 blood tests deliver your results with a ""positive"" or ""negative"" (for example, anything lower than 1:100 is a negative)  for the four chromosomal defects I listed above, as well as several others. It is 99% accurate at determining the health of your baby.  The only further testing is an amniocentesis, which carries a general risk of miscarriage (approximately 1:500). Most Maternal Fetal Medicine specialists will only perform an amniocentesis if you're at a high risk for a child with a certain disorder/defect and the benefit of the amniocentesis outweighs the risk of miscarriage.  Generally, the anatomy scan at 20w will accurately show significant chromosomal defects and an amniocentesis is typically done in the same range as the anatomy scan.   I had an amniocentesis at 22 weeks with my son, despite having a risk of 1:>5000 and two ""soft markers"" on his anatomy scan, our odds of having a perfectly healthy baby were definitely on our side, but knowing he was healthy was more important.  As it turns out, despite having an amniocentesis, he DOES have a chromosomal micro deletion, so.. there's that to think about as well. He had a neonatal micro array analysis done with genetics."
BabyBumps,3dz3h8,Luca_overthemoon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:50:11 2015 UTC,"Did you find out about the chromosomal micro deletion via the amnio? Or was it discovered after he was born? Just curious, if you don't mind sharing."

It is not something amniocentesis routinely looks for, and his birth defects are not a result of his microdeletion, they were all random.. how unlucky!"
BabyBumps,3dz3h8,Luca_overthemoon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:28:39 2015 UTC,Research this for sure. My husband and I had the first test even though I wasn't a high risk. Where I am it is mandatory to do the blood test between 16-20 weeks. But because there was something strange on our ultrasound we were a bit worried. Upon further research I found alot of doctors do not prefer to do further testing if your ultrasound is good and your blood test is good. This is because as far as I know the risk of an amino causing miscarriage is higher then your child having Downs.  Our third ultra sound showed no abnormality and blood tests were great. I still asked my brother in law (In training to become surgeon) and he said that the blood tests are pretty accurate.   If your blood test doesn't produce a great result then you could do an amino. But ultimately it would be up to you. Would it matter in the end? If you would keep the baby no matter what then the risk could not be worth it. I don't know!!! It's up to you in the end. I wish you so much luck.

My OB said that 1 in 50 is about when they start pushing for most testing.

BabyBumps,3dydfg,EveryOtherTime,3,Mon Jul 20 18:23:34 2015 UTC,Commenting to follow!

BabyBumps,3dydfg,bettyBoo77,6,Mon Jul 20 16:55:57 2015 UTC,My understanding is that your own cord blood isn't as useful to you as someone else's... I haven't done the full research myself but most recommend donating rather than storing it.
BabyBumps,3dydfg,lamicroondas,2,Mon Jul 20 17:52:55 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that you might be the rare case where storage might actually be worth it. I'm not a doctor or medical professional but when I did the research (a few years ago) my doctor friends basically said that if there were no known genetic diseases in the family, you should donate. It wasn't an option when I was last giving birth. The problem with storage is that (again-not a medical professional and this may have changed) is that it's hard to figure out who's doing it well/right and there are no guarantees. If you need the core blood later, there are no guarantees that it's been stored properly or will be in any state to help. That said, there maybe better evidence now to help you make a more informed decision. I'd talk to your husband's doctors and to your doctor to figure out if it's worth the cost. This time, our hospital let's you donate so we'll be donating."
BabyBumps,3dydfg,bettyBoo77,2,Mon Jul 20 18:26:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input! In our case, it's not a completely debilitating disease (although pretty sucky), and there's an incredibly small chance of kiddo having it (especially if female so that will factor in). From a logical standpoint, I think it might do more good on the whole being donated to research... From an emotional standpoint, I'd hate to take a chance, no matter how small, at saving our kid from a lot of suckiness. Super complicated. We'll be talking with a genetic counselor as a start."

That said, it's super expensive to store and there doesn't seem to be good evidence that it will be helpful. But I think you're doing all the right things-talk to a genetic counselor and talk to your OB. Our hospital has been great about giving us all the information we want. For us, donating is a no brainer because we're not willing to pay for storage but would LOVE for it to be used to help someone else.

For that reason we were going to donate to a public bank but our hospital does not offer donations.   Things like viacord scream ""scam"" to me. Some research shows that many customers are paying to have unusable tissue stored due to improper packaging and storage. Any company that emails me on a more than weekly basis for a ""free informational brunch or dinner!""

I know the science is there and they're really working on it, but at this point I just can't afford to take the financial risk when I'm already (seriously) losing sleep over the prices of health insurance in general... $200+ more a month in storage fees for something we may or may not need or may or may not be able to even use is just not possible right now."

BabyBumps,3dy9b8,Anna_Banananana,12,Mon Jul 20 14:51:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't buy stuff but I set money aside. Open a new savings account and put a couple dollars or more away a week. If you got a pay raise use the ""extra"" money to start saving and paying off any excess bills. By saving money you will be able to purchase the items you need once you become pregnant or after the baby shower. You will also have a emergency stash incase something comes up during pregnancy, like bedrest where you become unable to work.  Items can come and go in fashion or child safety. What maybe a good item now in a couple of years could be determined a health hazard. Plus certain items do not really store well over the years. Plastic can become dry and brittle or discolored depending on the storage environment.   You should also make a list of large wants or needs for your household. Several years ago me and my SO discussed having children and he wanted to make sure that we had a stable home. He wanted to own a home and make sure we had new/newish vehicles. He also wanted to eliminate as much of our unnecessary debt. So we worked on our finances, bought a house and saved money. I'm glad that we did that it has saved us.   I'm a planner and did a bunch of research on items I wanted years ago. I'm glad I didn't buy anything. So much changes over time. You can always get buy with the basics (crib, car seat, diapers) if money becomes tight. Or you may luck out and have someone gift you their hand me downs. Something that you are set onon now may change as you get older. There are so many different variables involved that can change.   And something that is hard to think about. Trying to conceive is a journey, some people have an easy journey and conceive after a month or two and sometimes it can take a year or more. Everyones journey is different and it can be stressful having baby items going unused around the house if you have issues with infertility. I don't want to discourage you. I hope that you can have a plan and lay a good foundation for your future."
BabyBumps,3dy9b8,robotmaythen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:27:12 2015 UTC,"This is great advice. Get your financial house in order. Honestly, 9 months is plenty of time to start buying (I was afraid to buy one single thing until after 12 weeks and I'm still feeling well prepared and ahead of the game on purchases here at 24 weeks).   And I don't mean to be a downer whatsoever, but it's not always easy to get pregnant. Many people try for a long time. I know if I would have spent money on baby items before TTC, it would have been so much harder to have them around staring at me for the 1.5 years of heartache it took to conceive. Not to mention that money sitting in baby items that I would have been able to use for fertility treatments."
BabyBumps,3dy9b8,digitabulist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:31:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your input, it was very thorough! I like the idea of opening another savings account. We already have a house and good cars, and we're renting out the unused bedrooms in our house for extra money on top of our incomes. But I definitely agree that a couple of dollars a week would end up being a lot of money after at least two years, longer potentially."
BabyBumps,3dy9b8,lamicroondas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:35:12 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend this, as you don't know what your world will look like when you do get pregnant. I wish we had started a baby fund years ago, I naively just figured ""we'll work it out when we get there"". Well, we're here and hubs is in school working part time, and I just started a new job with not great maternity benefits, oh and by the way we need a new roof on our year old house... The list goes on and on. We'll still work it out, but in those golden DINK years (dual income, no kids), we could have been saving more."
BabyBumps,3dy9b8,themadchild,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:49:58 2015 UTC,"I had a hope chest for when I got married. My husband and I found things over time that would be good for our first apartment together. If you're cloth diapering and have no big rush, you can look for more sales. Just get one or two at a time and it won't be so bad.  I'd recommend against clothing and blankets until after a baby shower, or you might end up with overkill."
BabyBumps,3dzrle,silla103,2,Mon Jul 20 21:15:21 2015 UTC,I second looking into renting one! Good luck
BabyBumps,3dzrle,tpmow,2,Mon Jul 20 23:50:03 2015 UTC,"Have you looked into buying a used one? It's not as gross as you think. Anything that touches the milk can be bought separately at a fraction of the cost. Also, I believe most hospitals will rent one to you, mine actually just gave me a manual one even though I already had my electric one. Yes a manual one would suck, but if your at home most of the time anyway, you wouldn't need to pump as often as you would if you were at work.  EDIT for additional question: Now that you aren't employed, who is your insurance through?"
BabyBumps,3dzrle,hottoddy4me,2,Mon Jul 20 21:21:47 2015 UTC,"I second this. I bought a Medela pump off of craigslist (double electric) for $60. I wasn't planning on purchasing a pump for a few weeks, but I got engorged 4 days after my little guy was born, and needed one ASAP without spending the extra money that we hadn't yet budgeted for. They gave me a ton of extra stuff to go with it, but I just went to the gift shop at the hospital and bought new tubes/flanges/shields/etc. and threw out everything but the pump and the power cords! Way cheaper than a whole brand new pump and it worked great the entire year that I used it!"

BabyBumps,3dxass,Shadow_raven95,58,Mon Jul 20 08:27:58 2015 UTC,"Eh I wont get into what I think about porn beyond ""used responsibly it is fine"".  The way he is using it, plus using it despite knowing your feelings? Not fine.  I would be seeking out a marriage counselor."
BabyBumps,3dxass,MaeBeWeird,25,Mon Jul 20 08:32:36 2015 UTC,"This is the only answer.  Regardless of viewpoints on porn, he's neglecting your feelings, hiding this from you at times, and isn't getting better. Just like anything else that is important to a person (religion, childfree vs having children, etc.), this type of thing needs to be agreed upon before marriage, else someone will get hurt - this is what is happening here.  OP - if your husband won't change his habit, then counseling is your next step."
BabyBumps,3dxass,UnicornToots,22,Mon Jul 20 10:08:44 2015 UTC,"Marriage counselor. The line about him getting drunk and saying hurtful things is a red flag. Yes, he is doing something deliberately hurtful, but to take it a step further... He needs help. And, he needs to be the one sleeping on the couch, not you."
BabyBumps,3dxass,Trexy,21,Mon Jul 20 10:50:42 2015 UTC,"yea you guys need help. im a married man with a pregnant wife, and she is afraid to have sex because of some bleeding the next day after sex a few weeks ago, so i watch porn sometimes too. but i would never ever reject her for porn, nor would i get drunk and say mean things to her to boot. sounds like an asshole to be honest."
BabyBumps,3dxass,rosekayleigh,3,Mon Jul 20 11:12:44 2015 UTC,"Your wife sounds like she's going through the same thing I am. I'm so scared to have sex because I had a little bit of bleeding the day after. I feel bad, like I'm neglecting my husband (who's always in the mood). That's another story though. I don't want to hijack the OP's thread.  OP: Your husband need to respect you and what you're going through. What he's doing is totally unacceptable. It sounds like he has an addiction if he's turning down real sex for simulated nonsense. Buying the Oculus Rift to watch porn is a huge confirmation of that. He needs to see a therapist. Too much pornography can alter the pleasure-reward centers of the brain and screw up your sexual functioning. He needs to deal with this problem before it gets worse. If I were you, I'd come up with an ultimatum. That's me though. I don't know your relationship or how your husband would respond to ultimatums. Only you can know that. I've caught my husband looking at porn twice (before I was pregnant) and I was devastated. I have a zero tolerance policy. So, in some ways, I'm probably not a good person to talk to about it because of my strict stance. I think it's such a flagrant slap in the face, especially when you're pregnant. You have every right to feel hurt and angry. Try getting him to talk to a therapist of he won't talk to you about it."
BabyBumps,3dxass,IsItMyTurnYeti,4,Mon Jul 20 14:04:06 2015 UTC,"I have no problems with porn, HOWEVER, he is using porn and turning you down?? That's hurtful and not okay! Maybe suggest couples counseling? Have you told him how badly he is hurting you?"
BabyBumps,3dxass,themadchild,4,Mon Jul 20 15:35:08 2015 UTC,This is an addiction. His drinking may be as well. He needs to be teady to treat his addiction before intervention or therapy is likely to work. What he is doing is emotional abuse: manipulation to sate his addiction. Can you nicely reach out to his family?

BabyBumps,3dxass,g33kch1c,3,Mon Jul 20 17:33:45 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry you have to deal with this right now.  Pregnancy is hard enough as it is.     I don't care what the substance is,  if he is not participating in your marriage,  dismissing your feelings and being hurtful toward you,  it is abusive and completely inexcusable. I agree with everyone else that counseling is essential. His willingness to retreat from your marriage might mean he is likely to refuse counseling,  and you can't make him go.  If he refuses,  you are faced with a very,  very difficult decision; accept his behavior,  or leave."
BabyBumps,3dxass,potatofreudster,0,Mon Jul 20 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I am with you on this one. I don't believe in porn in the marriage unless perhaps you watch it as a couple.  I would highly suggest a marriage counselor if he won't give it up, knowing how much it hurts you."

BabyBumps,3dys03,luigisfuckingpeach,2,Mon Jul 20 17:48:30 2015 UTC,"I like our Avent bottles.   Cleaning matters. Don't get something with a million parts unless your baby really has gas problems.  I thought I would save money by buying the larger bottle size as I didn't think I'd have a problem with just not filling. What I didn't realize was that the larger sizes come with the higher flow nipples. I'm glad I looked before baby came, but I did need to go and find newborn nipples.  I breastfeed and never had a problem sticking with the newborn nipples the entire time."
BabyBumps,3dys03,momonomicon,2,Mon Jul 20 20:22:52 2015 UTC,"We went through about 10 different types and brands before settling down on Dr. Brown's Bottles. They really helped, especially considering he was super gassy. We just got the slow flow nipples."

BabyBumps,3dys03,g33kch1c,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:49:15 2015 UTC,"No experience yet but I'm in the same boat as you. I plan on breast feeding but will pump for when I'm not home and Dad is and when my mother watches the baby when I go back to work 3 days a week. Someone bought the starter set of Avent Naturals for our shower this weekend and I am buying a starter set of Munchkin Latch as well. Both have wide nipples and supposedly mimic the flow of the breast. I'll see how these 2 kinds work out before trying another brand like Dr Browns, but the reviews on those 2 convinced me to try them out at least!"
BabyBumps,3dys03,sphyxy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:21:15 2015 UTC,"I have used serveral kinds including dr. Browns, avent, mam, a super fancy one I can't remember the name of that mimics the breast, and a couple different playtex ones. Hands down my favorite are the playtex drop ins. They are super easy to clean because you just throw away the liners, and with the coupling rings I can pump directly into the liners and pop them in the fridge. This also makes reheating the milk super easy, I just keep a coffee mug half full of water next to the microwave. When I need to reheat a bottle, I microwave the water for 30 seconds, then put the whole liner with milk in the cup for 30-60 seconds and the milk is perfectly heated, fast and never too hot. Just drop the liner into the bottle and replace the cap with a nipple and you're ready to go! I'm 38+6 with my second son, my first son is almost 21 months and still breastfeeds here and there. I don't offer but don't refuse him if he asks. I'm only making colostrum right now, so some days he doesn't ask and thus doesn't nurse at all, and other days he will nurse several times throughout the day, typically for naps."
BabyBumps,3dys03,MrsTroy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:14:43 2015 UTC,"These are our favorite. They are light weight, easy for baby to hold, easy to clean, and at a great price. I recommend getting at least 20 bottles. (2+ sets) Gerber First Essentials Still you might want to get a smaller set for your newborn if you don't breast feed."
BabyBumps,3dys03,Donaturtle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:37:44 2015 UTC,"I would only buy one each of a few brands that are known to be good for breastfeeding. Buy more after baby has a preference. Also consider your pump. If your baby will use the bottle nipple designed for your storage bottles it's more convenient.  My son wasn't picky, but he started on Nuk as a newborn, then he liked Avent, and finally preferred medela."
BabyBumps,3dys03,midwestlover610,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:57:29 2015 UTC,"I use Tommee Tippee closer to nature bottles as well as their pacifiers. The nipples for the bottles come in either 0-3 or 0-6 (can't remember and I'm too lazy to check) for slow flow. I suggest starting with slow flow, especially if you plan on breastfeeding as well.  Just depends on what your baby prefers. Some are picky and some aren't. So don't stock up on one brand of bottle until you know. If money isn't an issue maybe buy a couple single bottles, 1 per brand/type."
BabyBumps,3dys03,Frubberina,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:10 2015 UTC,Last time I just bought the playtex bottles. This time around I did research on the best bottle for breast feeding women and found one I really like. It mimics a boob. It's actually really neat and you can control low. medium and high flow on it! So no need to buy different nipples. Check out Adiri bottles.

The procedure I consented to was an IUD insertion which was supervised by and later double checked by a doctor. The observation I consented to was with my midwife. I said yes to the possible presence of a student midwife  and that they were allowed to gather materials or assist their teaching midwife (who would he the third midwife and not my.primaey or secondary midwife attending me) but that they were not to check me or preform any tests on me. I was allowed to be very specific with my peramiters  for the midwife, less so with the doctor student, it was more of an all in or all out thing."
BabyBumps,3dy19o,Preglant,2,Mon Jul 20 18:55:09 2015 UTC,"After a bit of research, here is the scope — you can refuse any treatment. Period.  Physicians require an expressed consent to treatment, and if you don't give one, they can't do anything to you.   I left 12 hours after my last delivery by c-section. They refused to let me go and I had to insist, telling them they can't hold me there against my will. I had to sign a paper, acknowledging that I was leaving against medical advice, but they let me go. Mind you it was in Newfoundland, but I am pretty sure they won't push treatment on you in Ontario either.   There is still no way I will let any student near me — last time I ended up being poked with a needles 3 times instead of one, and ended up with a giant bruise on my thigh that didn't go away for over a month - it was the longest time it took for a bruise to clear and it was brought upon me by a medical student!   http://www.cpso.on.ca/policies-publications/policy/consent-to-medical-treatment  http://settlement.org/ontario/health/patients-rights-and-responsibilities/rights-and-responsibilities-of-patients/what-are-my-rights-as-a-patient/"

You should also get your support person to back you up. The hospital/health region should have info on patient advocacy so you can find out exactly what your rights are. The only thing with the OB is depending on the size of the hospital and time of day/week there might not be another option. If you are really worried about not being respected, talk to your doc...don't let them downplay your concerns, also ask if you can make appointments with the other OB's who might end up delivering your baby, bring a birth plan, your support person and emphasize your concerns (this is encouraged where I'm delivering, but I'm in western Canada). Meeting them might allay some of your fears. You could also consider hiring a doula to help back up you your support person. You could also go back to the hospital and rescind your consent for student involvement."
BabyBumps,3dy19o,1veganhorsiesss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:36:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'm really not worried about other OBs, it's more the numerous and/or unnecessary procedures to let students practice (and the possible risks involved) that's my major concern. A more minor one that I thought of along with it is what if there's a doctor or a nurse who is being an asshat, do I have any rights, etc. It seems like we do have options after all. I don't really blame my doctor for not advertising that fact of course."

It's all just a waiting game at this pint but I can't sit and do nothing!

I can't offer you much advice atm since I'm still pregnant but I can tell you that you should really rest when you can. Anytime you can physically take a nap and have the opportunity, please do so. I have very little help since their dad lives 5000 miles away in another country and is too damn immature to get his shit together and I'm running myself  ragged. Dont be afraid to take some alone time. Seriously, have your SO take  your son and take a few to yourself.

Yeah you have to take care of a baby, but also take extra good care of you.

Are you still wearing your compression stockings?

BabyBumps,3dxstw,sameasaduck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:20 2015 UTC,"Sounds like this is pretty much resolved, but if it makes you feel any better I also had some spotting in the first trimester. Mine was around 7 weeks. I previously had a miscarriage, so when I saw the blood I was absolutely sure that was the end. But I'm currently 14 weeks and going strong! I had an ultrasound but they never did say if they found any reason for the bleeding.  The uncertainty of it was the WORST, though. I just wanted to know one way or the other so I could move on."

I had bright red bleeding at 7 weeks and again at 13 weeks and I definitely freaked out. It turned out to be nothing to be worried about, but it is so worth it to have that reassurance via ultrasound. I'm glad you're getting checked out so that you can rest easier as well. I wish you the best in the rest of your pregnancy!"
BabyBumps,3dxstw,rainbowbrite0884,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:33:43 2015 UTC,"I've had random spotting throughout my pregnancy. I've only had it twice in the second trimester. The last time was the day after sex. I'm 23 weeks now. I stress every time, but it's never accompanied by cramps and it's never much blood. The midwives and on call OB were never concerned because they didn't see any blood in my uterus in my early ultrasound and I wasn't cramping or bleeding much. I think mine was a result of straining to hard when I went #2 (sorry, tmi). Some women are just spotters. My mom was too. It doesn't necessarily mean anything bad. I hope you get some assurance on Thursday. I know how stressful seeing blood can be during pregnancy."

BabyBumps,3dxstw,whatgoesup56,6,Mon Jul 20 12:32:05 2015 UTC,I don't think relying on a test at this point is smart because it can take weeks for your hcg to go down after a miscarriage. I've done this in the past and was let down. I just don't want to over react and make something worse.
BabyBumps,3dxstw,whatgoesup56,0,Mon Jul 20 12:39:11 2015 UTC,React however you want! There's no such thing as overreacting when it comes to your body and the baby inside of it. You have every right to tell them you want an appointment.

BabyBumps,3dxj9e,itsAnthem,8,Mon Jul 20 10:32:08 2015 UTC,Hey you can go after him through the CSA however while he has no income there is nothing they can do. However once he starts working they will start deducting what he owes from his payslip.   What he owes will be totalled up and include what he owes to date. So for example of he takes 5 years to find a job. When he starts working he will owe 5 years of child support.  I know several people on both sides who deal with CSA.

BabyBumps,3dxj9e,ireallylikesculpture,11,Mon Jul 20 10:39:33 2015 UTC,No we don't imprison people for having no money.
BabyBumps,3dxj9e,Triforceninja,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:43:13 2015 UTC,Good on the UK.  How do they enforce that the father is paying?
BabyBumps,3dxj9e,ireallylikesculpture,3,Mon Jul 20 12:58:37 2015 UTC,"The CSA can take money directly from the parents wages, same as tax an national insurance, the parent doesn't even see the money."
BabyBumps,3dxj9e,kalyissa,0,Mon Jul 20 14:43:55 2015 UTC,I don't know of anyone who has had that.  There is nothing that can be done if they have no income. They won't go after families income.

BabyBumps,3dxj9e,slohomo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:59:33 2015 UTC,Isn't that only if they're not paying what's been ordered while employed? I don't think they can punish you if you have no income.

BabyBumps,3dxj9e,alwaystryharder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:58:11 2015 UTC,I've never heard of this happening in the US. My dad would've been in jail a lot for this. They can hold a person in contempt of court for not paying and then you can go through the process of having the state deduct their pay for the child support.

Remember unemployment isn't necessarily a choice, but it would be worthwhile flagging him up with CSA when baby is born.

BabyBumps,3dxj9e,PurpleKelpie,2,Mon Jul 20 10:55:11 2015 UTC,"As someone who's father is a tireless asshole who took every opportunity to be paid under the table so he could avoid automatically deducted child support: it might be worth it to completely cut ties. My grandparents also paid his living expenses until their death, when he was 53. The inheritance they left him (and me, although he stole my portion when I was a minor) lasted until he was 58. I hear he's now bordering homelessness.  It was hard to watch my mom struggle financially. I knew the exact cost of how much it was to raise me, because my mom commented about it constantly. To this day as an adult I feel like a financial burden. I'm very conscientious of what we can 'afford', even though we are easily middle-upper class.   I wish I didn't have the influence of my asshole sperm donor growing up. I wish he had no parental rights to leverage against my mother when he felt like hurting her. I wish she had walked away and remarried, found a way to be happy with someone else. There's lots of stellar step-dads out there, I wish I had one.   Anyways, this is just my perspective. The money comes with strings. If he pays whenever he does a get a job (if ever! My own dad managed unemployment for the vast majority of his adult life. Now he's ""retired"").. it can come around to bite you. So just be careful, because social services might pay more than he would and they won't turn on you and fight you."
BabyBumps,3dxj9e,xmck11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:14:49 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly!! As someone with a father who was given the option of keeping his £5 a week as long as he didn't come back it hurts like a bitch to know that he would rather have his money.  On the plus side I have absolutely nothing to do with him and I never need to.  I met him when I was 19 and cut contact at 20, the negativity that come along with having a parent in your life that is at best disinterested is a far bigger hurt than not having them at all.  My father's family also enabled him and anyone who thinks that it is OK for their grandson (and his mother) to be left with NO financial or emotional support is also not worth having around.  Cut ALL family ties."
BabyBumps,3dxj9e,kalyissa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:34:22 2015 UTC,I could have written this. My mom specifically did not put my father's name on my birth certificate (it says unknown). If he had wanted to be involved he could have petitioned the court for his rights after the fact. He didn't and my mom didn't have to worry about him manipulating her or me. I am far and away better off for not being around his toxic influence growing up.
BabyBumps,3dxng0,daybreakinglight,4,Mon Jul 20 11:30:08 2015 UTC,My dog got sprayed when I was preto with son #1. No issues!     We used Hydrogen peroxide mixed with baking soda and liquid Dawn to remove the smell works a lot better than all the other gimmicks and is what the local animal control recommends.    You can google for the amounts.    We also bought nature's miracle deskunking stuff (I can't remember the name) when we had the opportunity to further help.    Be careful where you wash your dog as the oil that the spray is made from can linger so you need do contain where you keep your dog so that things don't get ruined  Good luck!!

Our cat got sprayed a few years ago and it took so long to get the smell out of her completely - even then, any time she got wet (bathing herself, usually) she's start smelling again.  We shut her in the bathroom for the first couple of days to try to isolate the smell, and we tried peroxide as well as specific skunk smell remover stuff.  There's nothing harmful to your baby as long as you, yourself didn't get sprayed in the mouth and ingest it or something... even then, probably not!  Good luck with airing the place out!"

I was a hardcore dieter in a past life, always criticizing myself and making me feel guilty for any ""not-good"" thing I put in my mouth... and it drove me to develop an eating disorder. I've been fine for about 4 years now, thankfully, but it's been a struggle in those years not to be so judgmental about what I eat. Food is sustinance and nothing more - it's not something to be worried about, pregnant or not, especially if your doctor gives you a clean bill of health.  When I got pregnant, I decided not to change a damn thing about what I eat or don't eat - I just ate as I usually did. So far, so good health-wise for me and my baby - and no stress, worry, or anxiety... which is the best part!"

A bagel is much better than, say, an entire pizza. A little bit of what you fancy does you good :)   It's wonderful that you saw your daughter. I saw mine at a 4d scan a few weeks ago & it was the most amazing thing! She had her hands all over her face but we got a couple of pics.

Your body is getting the energy it needs to help LO grow, whether it's from a banana or for a bagel. As long as you have enough vitamins and good stuff-- from prenatals and from ""healthy"" food-- food that's less healthy isn't going to actively harm the baby.  Besides, once you hit 24 weeks or so, the baby can taste what you're eating, and the more things you try the better! ;)"

BabyBumps,3du8ev,irunfast2,5,Sun Jul 19 16:39:05 2015 UTC,"Well, worst case scenario, if some don't fit, you could make it a patch for the front of a onesie/shirt that does fit. Just cut out the graphic, and use either a fabric glue, sewing machine (more time consuming and I don't even know how to do this, lol) or iron transfer glue, and it'll be adequate for a month-aversary picture at least!"

Someone should tell that Etsy seller to use a different brand or she's going to have some very disgruntled customers.   For OP - just make sure you don't wash these in warm water, and don't put them in the dryer. And plan on cute pants so you don't have to snap the onesies for the picture. ;)"

Eating something like granola usually helps me, along with reading a very boring book in ""night mode"" on my phone's kindle app. If I can't go to sleep after an hour or so, I get up and take a hot shower. The drop in your body temperature after getting out of the shower and going back to bed (in an air conditioned room) is a great signal to your body to fall back to sleep. Even still, I am usually exhausted when I get up in the morning. Pregnancy and quality sleep just don't go together very well."

With a lot of work he put it, we cuddle and we're able to hold each other, but the back rubbing or random touching always made my body feel weird. But for this specific moment, I was able to enjoy it (then my body made the whole weirded out thing an hour later :( ).  Hoping it comes back though! It's like nails on a chalkboard to be touched for me.. It sucks.

BabyBumps,3dx7kj,SuperPaws,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:23:06 2015 UTC,Mmm... Milk!

BabyBumps,3dx7kj,rookiebrookie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:50:40 2015 UTC,I'm like that with milk w/o being pregnant. When I was hungover I craved milk more than anything too but I could easily put away a gallon every 5/6 days on my own. I've slowed down a bit and mixed it up with soy or almond milk since being pregnant bc I got gestational diabetes and am trying to keep to the serving sizes.

Now we are struggling to drink the 4L in a week.  I completely went off milk and still can barely drink it straight. For whatever reason it leaves a nasty chemical taste in my mouth most of the time. I can eat other dairy based foods (cheese, sour cream, yogurt etc) or eat things cooked with milk (macaroni and cheese and other pasta type dishes with dairy) but straight cold milk in a glass? Not usually.   I want my moo juice back!"

BabyBumps,3dzhex,PrimrosePlath,3,Mon Jul 20 20:04:42 2015 UTC,"I have never been worried about cooked wine. I have shrimp scampi, chicken picattta, and add red wine to my tomato sauce every time. I love wine sauce, and eat it frequently. I have never once felt even a little buzzed from alcohol cooked with food. And that is the point where you should be concerned.  They did a study about drinking during pregnancy in Australia, where it isn't so taboo. There were no negative effects for children whose mothers drank moderate amounts while pregnant.  Enjoy your wine sauces!"
BabyBumps,3dzhex,momonomicon,3,Mon Jul 20 20:35:48 2015 UTC,"The cultural variation is so interesting. It is really quite taboo in (many parts of) the US, but it also seems class-based, too. I study substance use and motherhood, and I've talked to lots of women whose doctors have told them that light drinking is fine - heck, some of them have even been encouraged to have a glass of red wine at night. Other women report their doctors telling them absolutely no alcohol at all, and even being harassed by family members or complete strangers if they, say, have a beer or something.  Part of the problem is that we just don't know enough about fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Some women drink A LOT and have no problems, others seem to drink only lightly and end up with complications. There might be a genetic or epigenetic factor involved (some genetic lines might be more susceptible). When I did my dissertation research, I talked to one woman who drank an entire fifth of rum every day during her pregnancy and had no complications (er, other than the alcoholism)."
BabyBumps,3dzhex,playingdecoy,2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:34 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. My italian friends make fun of me, because all their moms had wine throughout their pregnancies (not excessively of course) - but it's just a non issue for them."
BabyBumps,3dzhex,meepmeep1357,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:21 2015 UTC,"What I remember reading is that there is a genetic factor involved - if a woman processes alcohol well, her fetus will be fine even if she drinks during pregnancy, and if she does not, even small amounts will give the fetus FAS.

BabyBumps,3dzhex,playingdecoy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:46:31 2015 UTC,The gap in knowledge about FASD is HUGE isn't it? Your review sounds fascinating. The social class/educational outcome/racial background are factors here too. The Aust/NZ/Ireland/Brit study some have mentioned here noted a significant correlation with cigarette smoking (which itself is a class & mental health issue)  - did you look at that as well?
BabyBumps,3dzhex,Tomkhagai,6,Tue Jul 21 16:54:46 2015 UTC,"I did look at women who smoked, but I'm a criminologist, so they were largely included as comparisons for women using illegal drugs (to look at the added difficulties women faced trying to access health services, etc., while avoiding arrest). I did think it was interesting that I talked to women who had done cocaine, heroin, meth, all sorts of ""hard"" drugs, and they would often quit those drugs when they got pregnant but couldn't quit the cigarettes. I had one woman tell me ""I could put down the crack pipe and walk away, but I just can't seem to quit smoking."" Nicotine is addictive, yo!"
BabyBumps,3dzhex,Tomkhagai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:00:59 2015 UTC,Aah! Fascinating! I've got a mate in pop health who looked at the progression of smoking addiction for her masters. Amazing stuff.

I hope you don't mind me pulling you up on it; it's stringently reinforced to women that we shouldn't drink. I'm so disappointed we have this reputation internationally.  Here's what's dodgy about the science journalism:   Our National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines are strongly reinforced by docs and professional midwives across the country. They have this history:    1992-2001: no amount of alcohol is safe - just don't drink. 2001-2009: an occasional drink, defined as 1-2 units per week, is ok. 2009-present: no amount of alcohol is ok - just don't drink.   Guess when the Australian SCOPE data was gathered for the BMJ study? 2004-2011.    which leads to factor #2 - some science journalism is inaccurate,  irresponsible and quite frankly crap.  The study has been shonkily reported on in a number of the less reliable popular news sources. For instance, another point ignored by all but two articles is that occasional drinking was far more likely to have occurred in the first trimester, and, the BMJ study suggests, could have been limited to the 4-6 weeks before most women knew they were pregnant.  However, data was gathered at 15 weeks only.  Australian rates were significantly below those of other countries reviewed (I'm about to check that I read this correctly - will edit this again if so..) Yep I'm back. This article, contributed to by a study author, sums it up. The author mentions that occasional drinking was differently defined by some guidelines: http://theconversation.com/women-arent-following-advice-to-stop-drinking-when-pregnant-44304"

My grandmother's doctor said nothing and she had 2 Manhattan cocktails every day of her adult life, pregnant or not, and she had 7 healthy pregnancies and kids. I didn't drink a sip of alcohol during my first pregnancy out of sheer fear that anything could go wrong, and things went wrong anyway. So far, LO has been very healthy and I'll have an occasional glass of wine or half a beer. I read the Australian study and a few others and felt it was okay. Bottom line: If you aren't comfortable, don't do it, but I really don't think you have anything to worry about."
BabyBumps,3dwisd,Patternutz,3,Mon Jul 20 03:02:19 2015 UTC,"Mine definitely hasn't slowed down. If anything, I swear she's gotten even more active."
BabyBumps,3dwisd,Rosertot,3,Mon Jul 20 03:46:40 2015 UTC,Babies should remain fairly active until birth.
BabyBumps,3dwisd,MerMista,2,Mon Jul 20 06:51:47 2015 UTC,Mine actually kicks harder now. It does hurt sometimes for sure. I always wonder how they kick so hard and not break something in there! LOL.
BabyBumps,3dwisd,alycenwonder,3,Mon Jul 20 04:21:00 2015 UTC,Omg the momentum from a huge whallop to the side today nearly knocked me off the toilet earlier!
BabyBumps,3dwisd,samsg1,2,Mon Jul 20 11:25:33 2015 UTC,"My LO is always pushing her butt out right under my ribs on the right side. She pushed so much that she makes my bump uneven and it feels so weird! I keep talking to her and saying ""please, please, put your butt down"" haha"
BabyBumps,3dwisd,cheekyuptowngirl,2,Mon Jul 20 05:20:31 2015 UTC,"I never heard of babies slowing down as you approach birth. According to this, it's a myth. The only difference between baby movement later in pregnancy versus earlier in pregnancy is that there's not enough room to flip... but the baby will still keep kicking, moving its arms, head-butting, etc. like it always has!"
BabyBumps,3dwisd,UnicornToots,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:10:46 2015 UTC,I read that if they slow down it's actually cause for concern.
BabyBumps,3dwisd,cactuscat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:31:09 2015 UTC,"That's true for any point in pregnancy, yes. But the notion that it's normal for a baby to get less active in later pregnancy is what's a myth.   Not having a baby flip around anymore isn't a concern, but a drop in kick frequency may warrant a call to your OB. I do a kick count a few times a week just to keep track of this, but I don't count flips differently than kicks."

BabyBumps,3dyc4x,sparklekitteh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:26:57 2015 UTC,"Correct, they won't add vitamin boosts or protein unless you ask. The exception is a few that are ""pre-boosted"" and they list on the menu board which extras they include. Just ask them to skip!"
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,babylamb33,13,Mon Jul 20 00:34:43 2015 UTC,Yep should not have looked at that. Not at all. That needle...
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,giraffeneckhugs,2,Mon Jul 20 01:33:08 2015 UTC,I'm in the same camp and yet any time I'm faced with needles and choices I feel I need to research and watch videos/read stories/look at pictures. 99% of the time huge regret.   I don't want some gigantic needle like that all up in my spine. ..

BabyBumps,3dw2ea,giraffeneckhugs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:30:39 2015 UTC,I know!! Everyone laughs that I have 2 tattoos and piercings and didn't even flinch. But I paid for those and enjoy them etc etc. Epidural is temporary and medical. It's different! !
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,Devium92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:23:42 2015 UTC,I really hate needles and probably will never get a tattoo for that reason. I don't even like getting my finger pricked for blood sugar tests. My grandma always wanted to do it to me just to check and I always screamed and ran. I know it's bad.
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,giraffeneckhugs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:29:22 2015 UTC,"It's weird for me. I'm Canadian so I don't pay for medical stuff (beyond dental, eye and prescription meds) so a blood test is free. But I researched and planned my tattoo and put down a nonrefundable deposit.  If I chickened out I was now out that money which would suck.  The tattoos mean something to me and I love them. Might be why I can get them no problem and yet blood tests turn me into a nervous pile of tearful goop."
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,Devium92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:39:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I really want some tattoos but I'm too chicken.
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,giraffeneckhugs,0,Mon Jul 20 14:41:24 2015 UTC,"It's really not bad. After they give you a shot of lidocaine, which doesn't hurt any worse than any other shot, it's painless. Feels a little weird.... But doesn't hurt at all."
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,Lauren0,2,Mon Jul 20 02:59:44 2015 UTC,Yeah not good with needles at all. I have to be gassed to the heavens at the dentist if they are even doing a cleaning let alone a lidocaine shot if there's a filling or something to be done.   IV needles are even worse for me. Can't imagine having to hold still while in labour for them to muck about on/in my spine.
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,Devium92,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:03:11 2015 UTC,I was absolutely terrified of the epidural even though I knew I wanted one. It was not bad at all. You don't have to see anything. I just leaned over and closed my eyes. It was done in less than a minute.
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,prolificsalo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:02:13 2015 UTC,Well that makes it a bit better. I don't know if I want one or not. I think I'm still in the wait and see boat. Like if I can't breath through the contractions anymore then I will get one but things change.
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,giraffeneckhugs,11,Mon Jul 20 14:34:03 2015 UTC,I'm generally terrified of needles so I had imagined this a lot worse than it actually was. Thanks for sharing.. this has oddly calmed down.

BabyBumps,3dw2ea,Da-Honeybears,16,Mon Jul 20 11:12:26 2015 UTC,I spent last sat night watching youtube videos of natural births and then decided to watch births with epidural. I know it's different for everyone but the difference in the calmness of the mother and people in the room sold it for me. Poke a needle anywhere you want bc I def don't want what I saw in the natural videos. I'm pretty sure they only uploaded the blood curdling screamers with everyone in the room yelling a them to push or other things to youtube. Just watching those made me anxious.
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,hotsy__totsy,2,Mon Jul 20 00:58:17 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way after watching tons of birth videos. Besides, I'm not afraid of needles. Like, not at all. Terrified of spiders, but needles have never scared me. I've been poked at so many times in my life (blood draws, surgery, having my face repaired after a dog attack, allergy tests, shots, etc.) I'm very desensitized. I have a feeling I'll be begging for that epidural needle. :-)"
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,rosekayleigh,2,Mon Jul 20 10:27:56 2015 UTC,"I don't have a fear of needles, but I do kinda have a fear of not being able to control/feel an entire section of my body.  That's the part that scares me more about the epidural!"

BabyBumps,3dw2ea,hotsy__totsy,2,Mon Jul 20 12:28:00 2015 UTC,"Yep! We watched a lot of episodes of one born every minute and it's crazy the difference! They get the epidural and then they're either sat chilling with their husband or reading etc or they're sleeping!  I always thought it funny that people would be scared of the epidural to the point of not wanting one. It's a needle vs a human coming out of your vagina, neither really sound pleasant!"
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,LadyCatFeline,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:36 2015 UTC,My epidural was a breeze.
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,Lauren0,6,Mon Jul 20 02:53:56 2015 UTC,I actually think this looks kinda cool. I just hope mine works properly!
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,snailien,5,Mon Jul 20 00:44:28 2015 UTC,Thank you for this.  I need to see a medical procedure done before I feel comfortable undergoing it.  This has made me so much more calm about going through the procedure.
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,YourPlot,4,Mon Jul 20 02:30:32 2015 UTC,Oh god.. I didn't need to see that. I'm in panic mode.. Probably gonna need one of those suckers!
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,Monsterification,7,Mon Jul 20 00:39:56 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people have problems with epidurals, but I have had two so far, and two births and my epidurals were amazing.   It looks pretty intimidating from this angle, but I only felt pressure, like someone was poking me in the back with their finger, and a little pinch, and then sweet sweet relief."
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,SrslyYouToo,3,Mon Jul 20 00:51:24 2015 UTC,"Is there no local lidocaine? I had a spinal tap and follow up spinal patch and was given lidocaine for each, barely felt a thing!"
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,coppernecas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:48:09 2015 UTC,I got I shot of lidocaine before I got stuck with the big needle. I think that's pretty standard.
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,Lauren0,7,Mon Jul 20 02:54:51 2015 UTC,"I have zero regrets about my epidural. It was amazing! It didn't take very long to administer at all.  When it was administered I felt only pressure, no pain whatsoever, then it was pure pain-free nirvana."
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,alisani,3,Mon Jul 20 02:11:11 2015 UTC,Huh. That's not as scary looking as I thought. I hope seeing those pictures helps me instead of freaking me out when I'm in labour. Thanks for posting this.
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,HappyRoobee,3,Mon Jul 20 02:28:56 2015 UTC,That actually helped me be less afraid of it. Now I know what will be going on back there

BabyBumps,3dw2ea,makeupandmartinis,3,Mon Jul 20 09:06:54 2015 UTC,I'm only scared of an epidural because I heard a long time ago that it can paralyze you if you flinch or if the nurse administers it wrong. Idk how true or how possible that is but I've been scared ever since lol and I know I'm gonna need one!
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,YourPlot,5,Mon Jul 20 02:03:52 2015 UTC,"I had been worried about this too.  So I looked up the numbers.  You have a 1 in 250,000 chance of being paralyzed by undergoing an epidural.  So it's very, very, very unlikely to happen."
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,makeupandmartinis,3,Mon Jul 20 02:29:30 2015 UTC,You are awesome. Thank you
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,SrslyYouToo,3,Mon Jul 20 02:51:09 2015 UTC,"I have had two epidurals, I have had sever contractions through them and they basically tell you to get in a position where its kind of impossible to flinch and I had a nurse who was helping me stay in position.  Also the insertion of the epidural is done by an anesthesiologist, those guys are supposed to know their shit.  I think it cost me 10k just to have him walk in the room....     Anyway, he made sure I was in between contractions when he did anything, so he would pause if I was having a contraction, and it took him all of 2 minutes from start to finish."
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,midwestlover610,3,Mon Jul 20 04:00:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, my back muscles just spasmed from looking at that. I still have scar tissue and slight pain/tightening in the spot my epidural was administered. Also, you have to ""hunch forward"" and stay still... Really difficult to do with a giant contracting belly."
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,codysgrl10,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:55:10 2015 UTC,I had four of them. I also still get the tightness/numbness once in a while. Definitely got a weird feeling in my back looking at these!
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,midwestlover610,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:48:29 2015 UTC,Isn't it strange? I had two more spinals directly after my epidural(spinal headache). So I'm sure it has to do with the amount of scar tissue in the area.
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,MsBud,3,Mon Jul 20 12:51:22 2015 UTC,"It may just be me but having done a med free labor and delivery, that scared me more than delivering med free again. That looks scary as hell to me.   Edit: downvotes aren't a disagree button folks. We're all entitled to our opinion..."

I will do it when it's inherent risks are outweighed by other medical complications.      As a comfort measure?!? No thank you.     The funny thing in all this.   I'm absolutely fine with needles, I have great veins, I've given plasma regularly in the past and those needles have some serious gauge to them.  But I have two parents who are nurses,  and an number of friends as well who agree, if you are able to tolerate and progress well without it, the outcomes for yourself and the babe are worth it.   Being able to me mobile and alert after the birth is important for both mom and babes.  Do some women love it and think it's a miracle, yep.  Do some suffer bad placement, fever and other mild complications, yep.   Do a few suffer other worse ones, yep.  Horror stories are told more often that those of uncomplicated birth, but the statistics and incidence reports are worth checking into to balance these.  Am I glad that we all get to make our own informed choices.   Hells yes!   Work with your heath team and do what's best for you and your babe and what ever you do will be a'ok."
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,Shortkaik,2,Mon Jul 20 04:04:38 2015 UTC,This is about my thinking as well - it's great that we all have a choice!    I am not afraid of needles or of them doing it wrong but not being able to move freely?  That scares me!

I just remember the nurse distracting me and telling me to sit up and hold on to her arms.  I guess she is really awesome because she distracted me the whole time. I did not see that huge gigantic needle. The only clue I had was the husband (who has a fear of needles) turning pale and leaning against the wall, trying to crawl into the wall. Somehow, reading/watching these are scarier."

Not even the epidural headache or whatever else side effects they tell you about. I did freak out a little the first time when I saw the needle.   I could walk normally-ish for all of the births within roughly 10 minutes of having the epidural removed.  Hell, with my last two I didn't tear at all and was doing the laundry at home the day after I gave birth.  Practice really does make perfect I guess."
BabyBumps,3dw2ea,eshol02,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:36:57 2015 UTC,"I had always been extremely afraid of needles, just getting a shot would cause me to be light headed and to pass out, but I did get an epidural, and let me tell you something... It's nowhere near as bad as it looks.   The worst part of the whole thing is staying still while they are putting it in, since you are mid contractions.   You get a shot of lidocaine first to numb the area, and guess what, it feels the same as a REGULAR SHOT!   Then they insert the little catheter, which is mostly just a feeling of pressure. What helped me was to lean forward with a pillow under my stomach and squeezed my husband's hands.   The actual insertion only takes a few minutes, especially if you've got a great anesthesiologist, and the catheter that actually stays in your back is extremely thin.   Within 10 minutes of insertion, you are amazed at the lack of pain. The nurse would tell me, ""You're having a huge contraction right now!"" Literally didn't feel a thing. Even if not for the pain control, what was most amazing was being able to sleep and get my strength up for pushing a delivery, which is beyond exhausting.   Don't worry, when you are ready to push, you will definitely be able to feel it, you're body just takes over and does what it has to do.   I am 110% happy with my choice and will definitely get an epidural again with my next kids. Hope this helped to ease the fears!"

BabyBumps,3dw1bh,marrakesh,3,Mon Jul 20 04:24:53 2015 UTC,"I would assume ""who makes the rules"" are the same people who silently judge and don't show or rsvp to make some sort of point?

A warm salt water rinse is also good to help with the sore throat.   Having asthma, respiratory infections seriously suck ass. Some doctors don't recommend Vicks, some are okay with it. If you're desperate, put a blob on your chest after a hot shower. I'd do one or the other: honey with tea before bed to suppress cough to sleep well, and the hot shower / Vicks when you feel so wheezy you can't stand it."

BabyBumps,3dw1bh,melissarose8585,6,Mon Jul 20 03:24:51 2015 UTC,"A lot of places it's culture/etiquette. For example, where I'm from the average person spends $100 or more on a shower gift and you only get one no matter what. Most people can't afford to do this every time someone has a kid."
BabyBumps,3dw1bh,kalyissa,0,Mon Jul 20 03:36:14 2015 UTC,Wow seriously! If the person the shower is for has friends that can afford to do that even once than they themselves are probably well off enough that they don't need the free stuff and can manage on their own. My niece is having her second  and I plan on buying her new baby presents shower or not.
BabyBumps,3dw1bh,Yassssmaam,7,Mon Jul 20 03:49:34 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that people are well off, it's just that they are treated as major affairs in a person's life. You spend that money helping bless a friend with things that they are supposed to use for all of their children. Additionally, with etiquette calling for only one shower, the gifts tend to be a little more extravagant.   For second and other children, usually only family (close, immediate family) buys tiny gifts to bless the child.   But I'm from a highly traditional southern US background. I did etiquette classes and cotillion and all those little rituals that teach you how to behave in that society. So for us it's highly cultural and no one would dream of having a second or third shower. They've all had the same training! ;)"
BabyBumps,3dw1bh,TheLibraryLady,2,Mon Jul 20 08:58:20 2015 UTC,"My entire family, including my siblings and I, all did cotillion as well and the girls were debutantes (we're from Southern California though). While I was taught the same thing about showers, I still wouldn't call it tacky like some people did here. I think you're right. It's a cultural thing. The only time there would be more than one shower is if there's a significant age gap between children. For instance, my mother had me 11 years before my sister and she remarried before having my sister. My grandmother put on an extravagant baby shower at her home. It was catered and professionally planned. My brother, who was born 4 years after, did not warrant a shower though. So, it was the same thing you described. One big event, instead of several smaller ones. Ultimately, it's a matter of taste. If you're throwing smaller, more casual parties then multiple showers is fine I think. If you're having a bigger, more formal party then one is enough. It sounds like the OP was just having a little BBQ get-together though, so it sounds alright to me. She invited the men and was going to BBQ. Maybe it should have been called a BBQ for Baby, instead of baby shower to avoid confusion? Either way, her friends should've been more communicative and polite."

Every summer from ages six to ten I spent two weeks attending an etiquette school. It considered very rude in my family to have more than one shower unless you have a significant age gap (now throwing a celebration and asking for no gifts is totally different). However, my once removed cousin had a shower for each of their children, so I think it's just becoming common place. Now, I think it is even more rude to rsvp to an event you clearly didn't plan on attending, especially without issuing an apology! I mean, that's really poor manners in any social circle.  I say poopoo on the friends in this case."

Assuming he is literally yelling, is he ordinarily that unsympathetic and insensitive? Because the way he is treating you is absolutely not okay. I hope you know that. And I'm sorry you're dealing with it.   Perhaps you could get bring him in to speak with your OB or midwife about it? Or, if this is typical behavior, maybe a marriage counselor?"

Even if you weren't vomiting all the time and were in fact just being kinda lazy, he shouldn't be yelling at you. You yell at animals to stop them from doing something to hurt themselves or others, you don't yell at people and you especially don't yell at your spouse.  This is a selfishness/being a jerk problem, not a confusion about what it means to have HG problem.  That said, if you really were just exaggerating and he's just being a little whiny about having to do more chores, show him... literally anything related to pregnancy symptoms. My pregnancy app reminds partners pretty much every day that mom-to-be is probably very sick and very tired and to help her out by picking up some slack."

They can be a real eye opener. There is also a  YouTube clip of two guys who are hooked up to electrodes and have contractions simulated for them.

He's just snarky and aloof to most everyone, but she didn't know that.  Bradley is a 12-week series and is a major commitment.

BabyBumps,3dw685,TotallyInept,4,Mon Jul 20 02:00:54 2015 UTC,"My husband is the same way. When I had my first baby I thought that he would be more supportive because I'd be in a lot of pain but that was not the case. He complained that he was tired and I had to tell him to take a nap, even though I was the one who was in labor. He kept trying to tell me that's it's not that bad and it was my choice to not have meds so I couldn't complain. With this pregnancy I'm getting a doula so I don't have to rely on him. He's not a horrible person, he's just horrible at being sensitive and it's really important to have someone who will be looking out for you. I would suggest not relying on him if you don't think he can support you the way you need him to and bring in someone else. Good luck!"

I also don't have super strong feelings about my birth plan - I am willing to be flexible anything arises. But when I need the emotional support, I know I will REALLY need it. First step is to see if a doula is covered though! Sucks that the $ may decide but that's how life goes..."

BabyBumps,3dw685,Brendada,2,Mon Jul 20 07:15:05 2015 UTC,"Oh sister I hear you. Last night I was falling asleep wondering why the hell I fought so hard for our relationship a few months ago.   I hired a friend who is a L&D nurse as my doula. She did our birth and infant education classes and found a way to get SO comfortable and excited. Then she told me she is going to be gone for the two weeks prior to my due date. If I don't have baby by thurs this week, she won't be back until August 9. Fml.   My friends have all been flaky - I'm the first to have a kid amongst us. My mom has become a nightmare. I am going to let her be there because it's her first grandkid, but she is zero help on a normal day so I'm not counting on her. My little sister lives far away.  So, I downloaded the hypnobabies recordings. I've watched 2 million birthing videos. I've decided that this is my moment as a woman. Especially considering I am pretty sure I'll be raising baby on my own, I'm owning all of it.   When I picked my hospital, I talked to women who had delivered at the ones I could select from and made sure I picked one where the staff rocked. I had to go in for an NST at 30 weeks and got my first taste of the nursing staff. They will definitely help me power thru this.   Of course, at 37 weeks, with increasingly painful BH, pelvic pain, back pain, and third trimester morning sickness, most days I want to collapse into someone's loving arms and just be told it's going to be ok, I'm doing a beautiful job.

Don't really know how to rely on him because whenever I've tried to bring up some (usually rational) fear/concern I have,he brushes it off or shuts it down altogether. We decided long ago that he's going to be my birth partner but he's never been great at giving comfort and feels awkward about physical contact at the best of times! Now we're broken up I don't know what he's going to be like when the time comes. So yeah...... I feel you mama :("
BabyBumps,3dwz7g,junebug0331,2,Mon Jul 20 05:49:56 2015 UTC,"I had one at 38+4 and went into labor that night! So like 11 or 12 hours later? More specifically my water broke while I was in bed, lol. Had LO at 38+5!   It definitely isn't comfortable, that's for sure. But I thought of it like something much bigger will be passing through here soon, so this is something I can get through! I had DH with me and held his hand, which helped.   As far as symptoms after, I had some spotting immediately after (as in dr's fingers were messy), and the spotting continued all day but tapered off. Mild cramping for about an hour after the appointment and then just plain third trimester exhaustion.   My Dr said there was a 50/50 chance it could make something happen in the 72 hours after the sweep, so I took the chance and got my baby because of it! :)  Good luck, lady!!"

BabyBumps,3dwz7g,ejpg,2,Mon Jul 20 08:50:36 2015 UTC,"At my 39 + 5 appointment on Friday morning, my doctor asked if I wanted a sweep as I'd been having infrequent, but fairly strong contractions majority of the night before. It was uncomfortable, I think it depends on the person, but I just focused elsewhere and it's quick so that is a bonus! I started cramping when I got to my car in the parking lot, and had to take a second. Rest of Friday was uneventful - until about 9/10 pm and contractions really started. I toughed it out at home for over twelve hours, practicing breathing techniques & swaying on all fours because this part was truly painful & I had the most intense back labour with each contraction. when they were 3/4 minutes apart, I went into the hospital and was admitted by noon Saturday, (7/18) & at four cm & fully effaced. Long story short, one perfect, & heartbreakingly beautiful baby boy was born at 6:43 pm that night and was incredibly fast for a first-timer such as myself. (I was told I only pushed for maybe twenty or so minutes before he joined the world!) - The sweeps may not work for everyone, but I firmly now believe if baby is done cookin' they absolutely can ramp things up & get things moving. wishing you the best of luck! & my apologies for the wall of text! 😌🙏🏻"
BabyBumps,3dwz7g,riveting_rosie,2,Mon Jul 20 12:08:51 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, some docs/MWs won't (can't?) do a membrane sweep unless you're already at least a centimeter or so dilated. I asked my MW for it in my last pregnancy and was denied, even though I was overdue, since my cervix was still sealed up tight. Hoping for some earlier dilation this second time around!"

If you've had a cervical check before, it is really just an extension of that. Doc explained that she literally just swept her fingers around up there - it took no time at all and I didn't even know she did it until she said she had.   I had some light spotting for about 24 hours afterward. It hasn't seemed to help kick start my labor, since I'm still sitting here pregnant four days later at 40+4!"

It is a medical procedure and should never be done without your consent.  Yet so many doctors do anyway.
BabyBumps,3dwz7g,entailments,3,Mon Jul 20 07:58:29 2015 UTC,"FWIW, we had talked about it the week before and I had asked for it to be done. You're right, she should've said something before doing it though."

BabyBumps,3dwz7g,Cyndragosa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:09:01 2015 UTC,"Membrane sweeps haven't been shown to be very effective at starting labor. Source My labor starting was probably more related to the fact that I was overdue than getting the sweep. I have heard of people getting them weekly starting at 38 weeks though. The risks are pretty much nil, so it's common practice. I think it's a personal choice as to whether you want to try and let things happen naturally or try to hurry things along."
BabyBumps,3dwu7w,awkward_thunder,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:53:53 2015 UTC,I wasn't nauseous with my first much at all and it was all later in my pregnancy. This time I've  been horribly sick since 5 weeks. Had to start taking otc meds for it because it's been brutal. I have all sorts of symptoms I never had last time. I wear I've had round ligament pain for a couple weeks ((currently 12 weeks). Even though it seems to early I remember that feeling from last time.

BabyBumps,3dwu7w,Evervescent0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:23:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I felt queasy at 4 weeks on the dot. By that point, I'd known I was pregnant for six days (early BFP) and was really excited to enjoy a couple of weeks symptom-free before things got going. No such luck. My husband and I went to a nice restaurant and my stomach was oddly unsettled. I could hardly force down food. I thought it could have been unrelated to pregnancy, but the next day (4w1d) the nausea kicked in with a vengeance and stayed.  I don't know about round ligament pain at 6DPO, because I'm pretty sure that's related to the uterus stretching out and I've never made it past the first trimester before, but I definitely had weird twingey/tingly pelvic cramps starting at about 5DPO. They were really different from anything I've felt before, to the point where I told a friend ""if I'm not pregnant, I am truly going to check myself into a mental health facility for TTC-related delusion, because I swear to God I'm implanting."" Lo and behold, BFP.  Good luck!"

BabyBumps,3dycpm,digitabulist,5,Mon Jul 20 15:16:28 2015 UTC,"I was just in the same situation! I had a friend who had offered, but then her marriage basically exploded recently, and no way am I going to ask her about it now. I'm 27 weeks tomorrow, so two weeks ago at 25 weeks I was really starting to wonder what the heck I should do. I did not at all feel comfortable just blatantly asking my friends if they would throw me a party so I could get free stuff. But dammit, I wanted that free stuff!  A friendgirl of mine gave a perfect solution - ask a family member to be a ""silent"" host and throw the darn thing yourself. I asked my aunt to be the ""front man"" and I'm doing all the planning, invites, etc. Just put the front man's name for the RSVP  and set up a joint email account ""wimwoodsbabyshower@email.com"" sort of thing, for people to correspond with. They don't have to know who was actually behind the mechanics of it all. That might actually be a relief for your MIL because she can get the kudos but doesn't have to worry about the time or expense of planning two in one month.  My aunt was happy to do it. Hopefully yours will too!"
BabyBumps,3dycpm,wimwood,2,Mon Jul 20 16:29:56 2015 UTC,That's a great idea! I'm 17w and it hasn't been mentioned to me either- which is crazy cause I have tons of friends and close with my family. I may have to do this if it comes down to it. Thanks!
BabyBumps,3dycpm,Grkgdss00,5,Mon Jul 20 20:50:25 2015 UTC,"If you want a party, throw one yourself. Make it less ""shower""-y and more like, ""Let's have one last party before the baby is here! Come for lunch, and bring a gift only if you want to!"" Send them a link to your registries if you want to, but maybe be casual about it.  I'm having a shower when I'm about 36 weeks pregnant and it's being thrown by my mother at my sister's house. My sister is the closest family member to me, geographically, and is shitty at planning things so I asked my mom to do my shower. I didn't feel needy or bad about it - I just said that I wanted a baby shower and we should do it at my sister's house (my sister was and is thrilled to host!) but, even though my mom lives 2000 miles away, she needs to help my sister out with most of the prep.  I don't feel like ""that girl"", nor do I feel unreasonable for doing it the way I did. But, if you want to avoid any awkwardness, maybe just have a fun little lunch with your friends and family in place of a mom-planned shower."
BabyBumps,3dycpm,UnicornToots,2,Mon Jul 20 15:27:08 2015 UTC,"I know EXACTLY how you feel.  I'm 28 weeks and no one has offered to throw me a shower.  Everyone assumes I am having one - and I discussed a good date for it (with mom, MIL, always-busy friends) when I was just barely pregnant since all of both of our families live out of town and would be travelling in.  I think since we decided a date so early people figured someone was already throwing it.  I know some people say to just throw it yourself, but I don't personally feel comfortable doing that.  I don't want to send out invitations asking people to come to my own shower. Just my personal taste.  I thought by best friend would offer, and I dropped some hints, but either she didn't get the hints or she doesn't want to host.  That's fine, I'm not going to force her.  I actually cried a bit this past weekend because I figured I should just give up and not have a shower since clearly no one cares enough about me to throw one!!! (cue preggo hormones, trying to hold back tears during Zumba class)  In the end, today in fact, I decided... I will -organize- the shower, but I've asked my mom to be the official host (the one people RSVP to, etc.)  We'll rent a private room in a restaurant or community centre.  It's not ideal but I really want a chance to get together with my friends/family one last time before the baby comes, that's what really matters to me!"

I don't really need it to be fancy with all those pinteresting things at all honestly, I just want to see my friends and family and have my day, and not feel like a loser that no one cares about.  Also, what do I say when people keep asking when my shower is??"
BabyBumps,3dycpm,shouldbutwont,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"This might be a different and unhelpful perspective, but in my family's culture, we don't ""do"" showers (viewed as bad luck). I still wanted to celebrate the baby, so we're going to have a baby-themed party after the baby arrives. I personally don't need anything (this is my second girl) but if people bring a gift that would be lovely and appreciated too -- in your case you could include registry info though?"
BabyBumps,3dycpm,Axenus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:55 2015 UTC,Yeah we don't do showers in my family's culture either. Plan to have a 0th birthday party essentially once the kid gets here. No gifts expected just everyone celebrating and being fat on foods together and seeing the newborn.
BabyBumps,3dycpm,MAC_Sable_eyes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:02 2015 UTC,"Same here. I'm part south East Asian and part of my culture (especially the husband) considers it bad luck to have a baby shower before the baby is born. They are really superstitious and worry that the ""GODs"" or ancestors might get pissed off and take the baby back. We do however have a ""baby shower"" after the baby is born that is hosted by the parents. Usually, that is around the baby being a month old or a year old. The great thing about my culture is that instead of baby gifts, you get money! Money for in lieu of wedding gifts. Money in lieu of birthday gifts. Money in lieu of baby gifts! It is not considered tacky but actually expected. Nowadays, more Americanized people would bring gifts though."

My family (parents, siblings, and grandmother) is in Southern California and I live in New England where my husband and his family are from. Maybe if I were back home in CA, I'd be expecting it a bit more. I understand having dreamed of your shower and being disappointed about it not happening. I still think it's a privilege and it's not the end of the world if you don't have one. I never like expecting parties, gifts, or anything like that because not everyone is as conscientious as you'd like them to be. So, I always go in expecting nothing (except for when it comes to my husband, of course) so I'm never disappointed. Anyways, I do hope you get your dream shower, but if you don't, you have your dream baby and that's what really matters. :-)"

It really is there for a reason! The sole purpose of a registry is to let you know exactly what mom and dad want for their baby.

We just feel that a lot of new parents get so extremely caught up in BABY (understandably so) that they forget to spend time & energy on themselves & each other. Plus, a new baby is stressful!

BabyBumps,3dwfle,ginakirsch,3,Mon Jul 20 03:20:56 2015 UTC,Oh wow. I've been worried about the same thing all day. Ive been having episodes of cramps in the middle-right side of my belly lasting a few secs and occuring every couple minutes... Now resting and drinking water to see if it passes. This is all so nerve wrecking! I'm glad to hear it was a false alarm
BabyBumps,3dwfle,katiegrillz,2,Mon Jul 20 03:19:46 2015 UTC,So glad you got checked out... and that it wasn't a worst case scenario (although sounds awful as far as pain goes!).
BabyBumps,3dwfle,SrslyYouToo,3,Mon Jul 20 03:08:42 2015 UTC,"I see that you had your first baby quite some time ago, and while I do not want to assume anything about your age I can tell you that for me personally... it was way easier to be pregnant when I was younger than now.   I was 25 when I was pregnant with my first, I turned 26 a week later.  That pregnancy was a breeze, even my midwife said ""I am not really supposed to say this.. but those teen moms! They bounce right back!""  My last I was 33, turned 34 on the day he was born and that pregnancy was way harder, and I know it was because my body was older.   And now at 34, turning 35 this week and giving birth again next month its even worse this time."
BabyBumps,3dwfle,SrslyYouToo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:13:53 2015 UTC,"I was 16 when I had my first and  minus a bit of morning sickness it was the easiest pregnancy. I just turned 28. Everyone's been telling me it gets harder the older you get, I assumed it would be the opposite. I would have really liked one more but not sure I can go through this all again.  Poor us :("
BabyBumps,3dwfle,rosekayleigh,2,Mon Jul 20 04:31:31 2015 UTC,"My sister was 15 when she had her first, she was your age when she had her second.   She was telling me how two weeks later she was up and fine, but when she had her second at 28 the recovery time was a LOT harder.   I think its harder to have an infant when you are a teenager, but its definitely harder to be pregnant when you are older!"
BabyBumps,3dwfle,carissimos,2,Mon Jul 20 04:34:25 2015 UTC,"I find that laying down helps. If possible, try to sleep it off. When I have a bad pain (migraines, round ligament pain, cramps before I was pregnant, etc.) I try to sleep it off if I'm home. When I sleep, the pain dissipates so that when I wake up it's practically gone. It can be hard to fall asleep when you're in pain. You could take one benadryl (which is safe during pregnancy, but ask your doctor if you want professional assurance) if you can't fall asleep naturally. Take a few Tylenol before passing out and then nap for a couple hours. It might help if you're anything like me. Good luck!"
BabyBumps,3dvvjp,Amandalovesu904,3,Sun Jul 19 23:34:41 2015 UTC,"My back KILLED from about weeks 17-20ish, then got better (until later in third trimester, anyway). I figured my posture, which isn't good anyway, was thrown off as my bump started to form and my gait changed a little.   Do you have a snoogie or some kind of support pillow? Sleeping with the support behind me and a pillow between my legs made my back pain a lot less severe. I also found that some prenatal yoga poses helped, going between the cat and cow position on all fours seemed to work some of the soreness out and help me stretch.   Don't feel bad that your husband is doing the housework- you're growing a human!"

This time, i started incorporating chiropractic care into my week starting at the 3rd trimester. I would have started chrio earlier and go more often but I cannot afford more than I'm going now.  I can tell you it makes a huge difference immediately (the con is that when you get out of alignment you feel pain again....)"
BabyBumps,3dvvjp,crunchyfayetteville,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:43:11 2015 UTC,"My back started getting bad after 20 weeks. It progressively got worse while working four 10 hour days, going to school and keeping up on house work. Finally it got to the point where I was missing more and more work and my back would have me in teara after only being at work a few hours and then  be sore the entire next day.   Finally my doctor wrote me a note for a seated position at 36 weeks and my work couldn't accommodate so I have been off since then.   Do not suffer as long as I did before seeking some sort of relief. It's not worth it."

I luckily have a desk job but even that is hard sometimes because of the pressure. Make sure you are wearing the most supportive and comfortable shoes possible, it should help some. Also try taking an NSAID (Aleve, ibuprofen) before the pain hits & sit w a heating pad at night on low."
BabyBumps,3dvvjp,ElucidatedOne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:24:40 2015 UTC,"Just remembered that you NOT supposed to take NSAIDs while pregnant, I did on occasion anyway. I think there is more of a risk in 3rd trimester."

BabyBumps,3dvbad,haeley13,16,Sun Jul 19 20:42:04 2015 UTC,"That is my age gap with my younger sister.  Advice: don't treat your older child differently since there is now a younger person in the house (example: don't refuse to let your older child do things they should be doing, like going out, having friends over for sleepovers, having parties, etc because there is now someone younger who isn't allowed to do those things).  The biggest issue with our age gap in my experience was the fact that I couldn't do certain things because my younger sister would want to do them too or want to do them earlier than I was allowed to do them, and it caused a lot of resentment.  Set rules about who is allowed to do what and at what age and stick to them, and if your younger child throws a fit because ""they aren't allowed to do them too"" teach them that it is because of her age and that they will when they're that age too.  I wasn't allowed to do a lot of things for the reasons I listed but my sister was able to do them and at a much younger age (once I was no longer living at home, so my sister's pre-teen and teenage years) ""because she doesn't need to set an example for anyone like you did.""  Resentment-city.  I always explained it to my mother as ""everyone in the house is only as old as [younger sister],"" so please, don't do that to your older sibling."

BabyBumps,3dvbad,FKPuu,2,Mon Jul 20 12:05:53 2015 UTC,"I was 7 when my little brother was born. I wanted a little sibling SO BAD and doted on him for a long time. And then there was a period of years where I was going through puberty and my little brother clung to me and I was perpetually annoyed by him. I hated the huge time difference, I just wanted a sibling I could relate to! By the time I was in high school we were getting along again and now at 25 & 18, we are good friends and the gap is barely noticeable anymore."
BabyBumps,3dvbad,EmbraceThisMoment,2,Sun Jul 19 22:09:25 2015 UTC,"My brother and I are 5 years apart. I loved him so much! He was my adorable little brother and I loved helping take care of him and playing with him. I was like a third guardian when he got a bit older... I was always very protective of him. I helped him with school, and with life in general, since I was ahead enough that I could actually provide some advice and guidance. As a kid, he really looked up to me. There were times when he annoyed me, of course, because he would stick to me like glue, but overall we got along very well. Now that we're both adults, we are still very close and often hang out.  There are lots of very positive aspects to the 5+ year age gap. Definitely ask for her help with the baby. She will be happy to help and be a big sis. Make sure to give her 1 on 1 time without the baby as well."

I think there was a period of resentment between my 2 sisters growing up, the older intimidated the younger. The older thought the younger got preferential treatment. I feel like that sort of thing is pretty normal for siblings with any age gap, there are going to be periods when there is tension.   Now my siblings are like my best friends. We're all really close. There were benefits for the younger ones (introduced to cool stuff earlier, we took them to do fun stuff like snow boarding trips and concerts etc) and for the older ones (experience with babies, more freedom from parents, no pressure to have kids, parents don't have empty nest).   I'm so happy my parents had so many accidents!"

Only advice I would give is to not use your daughter as a babysitter when time comes. I am the oldest of 4 and my next siblings were 6 and 7 years younger, so I babysat them from very young age (different country where it was normal). I couldn't go outside to play unless I took them with me - and what's the point of going out when I have to supervise two toddlers in a sandbox?   My daughter seems to be excited about the new baby and we put some ideas in her head about teaching the new baby walk, talk, read, write and doing art, picking her up after school together.  She is a very loving girl and she will love her little sister, I can totally see that."
BabyBumps,3dvbad,Preglant,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:13:31 2015 UTC,My brother and I were pretty far apart in age. It is harder I think because your child is so used to being an only child. I remember feeling awful about having a sibling after being alone and loving it for so long (The age gap was like 12 years though). But as the day grew closer I got excited and happy. I love my brother and it's almost like I am the fun older sibling. He comes to my house for sleepovers and we do fun stuff together. I love it.

My expectations were put on a very high pedestal and everything was ""for her. "" so I agree with that other comment, please let your older one still live her life as kids her age do and not expect her to be the role model that the younger one needs. Talk about pressure. My sister and I definitely have differences in personality and different interests in pop culture because when she was a blossoming 13 year old I was partying it up with my 20+ year old friends. I found her annoying for the most part and since I was supposed to be the ""role model"" I definitely became a mother hen to her which I feel had been detrimental to her in her maturing years because she's always been babied by everyone. 7 years is quite the difference if I say so myself.

BabyBumps,3dvbad,Kristiejoy,2,Mon Jul 20 05:13:05 2015 UTC,"I always wished that my brother and I were closer in age. He is seven years younger. Our house was Resentment City  Rant Time: I always had to babysit him (starting at 11 until I left the house at 17), I was always the one in the wrong (no matter what the circumstances), I always had to do the sharing and the sacrificing (he had to be included when my friends came over, if I was playing with something and he wanted it, he got it. He could be in my room but I couldn't go in his). The parenting style changed from good to poopy between kids but I was still held to the old standard. I was late for curfew by 20 minutes at 15 and I was grounded for weeks, he stole my mom's car for a joyride at 2am when he was 15 and nothing. End Rant.  My advice: Be consistent and remember that your daughter has been an only child for seven years so she might get crabby from time to time about her new sibling."
BabyBumps,3dvbad,kotacoette,2,Mon Jul 20 05:22:47 2015 UTC,"That does sound harsh!   My 14 year old never babysits the 7 year old. Neither one is allowed in the others room without permission. I especially stress this to the 7 year old because he tends to be the one to break this rule. When my oldest son has friends are over, I make the little one to give them their space."
BabyBumps,3dvbad,ComfortablyyNumb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:58 2015 UTC,"My sons are nearly 7 years apart.   In the early days it was absolutely fine. We were very honest with my first son about his half-brothers arrival. They had to share a bedroom from the start, so it was a big adjustment for him.  The hardest part for me was making sure I gave my oldest child special time with me whenever possible. Just the two of us, going for a walk or going shopping, anything. He has to know that he's just as special and loved as he ever was.   14 months ago we had our third. She's two years younger than my middle boy, and 9 years younger than the oldest. I can see big differences in the relationship between the two boys (oldest son loves his brother, but the little guy can be a drag - tantrums are not fun, and he doesn't know how to share toys), and between each boy and our daughter. The babies are great friends, and my oldest boy has become more of a protector of the two, and he is my best little helper.   It is difficult for a 7 year old to learn that fighting over a toy with a two year old will never have a positive end, but he has learned to compromise. And I always reward him for tolerance and patience toward his brother."
BabyBumps,3dvbad,AMeadon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:47:50 2015 UTC,"My sister is 11 years younger than me and my brother is 15 years younger. Lol. Don't worry. In the end, they'll love each other no matter what. She'll be the big sister and get to learn so much from helping you with the baby. I did with my siblings and it prepared me for motherhood in a huge way. A 7 year age gap isn't that big, all things considered. I get along great with my sister and she's always felt like my sister. My brother only recently started feeling ""brotherly"" to me. He was more like a baby to me for years. Now he's 14 and we have a much more equal relationship because we share some common interests (mainly video games, lol). And he has tons in common with my husband, who is the also the baby of his family (they are both really good baseball players and talk sports all the time). He can't wait to be an uncle.  Whatever the age gap, they're siblings. It'll work itself out. I do agree with the person who said to not treat the older child differently than you would otherwise just because there's a baby around. My mom was very strict with me as a kid and very lenient with my sister and that drove me nuts. Make sure you show your older daughter plenty of attention after baby comes. You can feel forgotten when you're the older sibling. Involve your daughter in the care of the baby, but don't overburden her. It'll help her feel like she's part of the process instead of just outside looking in. Mainly, try to treat them equally. The rest will sort itself out in time."

The day my mom had him my aunt and uncle watched me, took me to old navy to buy a new dress, and then we went to the hospital where I got to meet my new little brother.   Being on the other side of things I would say it's a great experience. She's old enough to understand why babies need so much attention but at the same time there will still be some jealousy. Just make sure to include her.   My biggest issue with growing up was that he got more presents than I did.

I think there are pro's and con's to having them really close as well as having a big space between. Also, I am 12 years older than my baby brother and it was great.

BabyBumps,3dur3h,HeavensTouch,6,Sun Jul 19 17:51:13 2015 UTC,"Find a crock pot cookbook (or recipes on Pinterest). I love ""Fix it and Forget it"" cookbooks. They are so easy the directions are literally: put ingredients in crock pot and cook on low/high for X hours. I am going to prep a bunch of those starting at 36ish weeks by putting all the ingredients in a freezer ziploc and then writing cook times on the bag. I'll probably have to defrost the bag the day before I want to cook it but that's no biggie. Plus the crock pot recipes generally make big batches so you get lots of leftovers."

BabyBumps,3dur3h,LadyCatFeline,4,Mon Jul 20 19:47:12 2015 UTC,"We made the freezer meals yesterday at 37 weeks, one month's worth of food. I cooked all the meats and such, like teriyaki chicken with onions and stuff cooked in, then bought a ton of packs of microwave steam veggies and microwave uncle bens rice and instant mash packs. More room in the freezer for food and some bits are fresh :) Also, some things like banquet pies are 87c each and microwave in 4 mins, then you don't have to have something reheated.  For the hospital bag, we just did that too. Same stuff we'd pack for a weekend away, PJs, clothes, toiletries. Camera and batteries, any entertainment like a book or magazines. Stuff for your husband like a pillow, blanket, clothes etc. Snacks, nursing bra, pads, nipple cream. We have it in the trunk ready to go, a towel in the car for possible leakage, and then we have a list stuck to the back of the door for things to grab on the way out (phone chargers, wallets, a sandwich etc)."

BabyBumps,3dur3h,spatts0709,7,Mon Jul 20 12:57:21 2015 UTC,"I haven't popped a kid out yet...but one of my favorite semi- prepare ahead and freeze things that is stupid easy is shredded chicken in the crock pot which can be made into so many different things. I'll get a giant pack of chicken breasts from Costco or one of those family packs (we have a huge crock pot so just put in what will fit without it overflowing when liquid cooks out of the chicken) put in half a diced onion, whole-ish box of low sodium chicken broth, throw in some parsley flakes and pepper. Cook on high (if you have a crock pot you can program) for at least four hours and low for four or five more until we get home from work. Attack with a couple dinner forks to shred, maybe a knife and a fork...There should just be a little bit of liquid left, I'll typically separate it into at least two or three batches where some gets frozen. You can do so much with this, future filling for quesadillas, enchiladas, throw barbecue sauce in and mix for sandwiches, can make chicken corn chowder or white chicken chili pretty quickly if chicken is prepped ahead. So much can be done with shredded chicken, its great when it's just sitting in the freezer ready to go with whatever whim you have to quickly throw something together. Can even just thaw in the fridge and make chicken salad! Sometimes I like ladeling in a bit of the broth to the ones I freeze in case I want to season in a pan, it helps with cooking. Sometimes I'll just throw in a can of diced mostly drained tomatoes, can of rinsed black beans, some cumin, garlic and diced red pepper and some other spices and cook real quick in a skillet, use as taco filling with some cheese, lettuce and sour cream. It is very versatile."

BabyBumps,3dur3h,hotsy__totsy,2,Sun Jul 19 20:32:29 2015 UTC,"I did mine around 36 weeks. I did lasagna, enchiladas, beef stew, ginger-squash soup, calzones, meatballs, marinara, and individual pocket pies. I also bought frozen rice from Trader joes's as an easy side. My biggest regret was that nearly everything I made had cheese in it and my little guy ended up having a milk protein sensitivity. This time around I won't be stockpiling quite as much food (we got rid of our extra fridge/freezer) and I will make sure to include a lot of dairy free options. Also, the problem I had with the casserole style dishes was that the heating time is so long. I had to be thinking about what to throw in the oven about 2 hours before we wanted to eat. Not a big deal if you have some foresight, but it was hard for me when I was running on empty."

BabyBumps,3dur3h,jumble_bee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:29:31 2015 UTC,"Same boat with the hospital bag, GD, and freezer meals!!! I made 38 weeks yesterday and I'm thinking I will keep with the diet though because now I'm used to it and I know what's good and what doesn't work and hopefully with breastfeeding the weight will fall off like I've read about it doing (but I won't hold my breath.) As far as freezer meals- I started today. I've got a pot roast going in the crock pot and am going to start making gumbo later this afternoon. My husband had a man shower in another city where all our friends are and came back with a lot more meat/food left over than he expected so I also plan on cooking that and divvying it all up to grab and go too at some point this week. My aunt has said she wants to come over and make a bunch of freezer meals for us too but I'm worried that if others do that then the GD diet will not be considered so I'd rather make most of them on my own. I plan on doing portion controlled containers though since currently my husband and I work opposite hours..well now he does since Friday was my last day at work..but the portion control food has been what has helped with the GD numbers being good. I would could cook extra for dinner then grab a thing of leftover dinner to eat for lunch the next day. I started a pinterest board for freezer meal ideas but I doubt I'ma be in the kitchen making all those fancy meals. It's more just to have ideas I guess. I'm thinking maybe lasagna, spaghetti (I've had whole wheat pasta spaghetti once and my numbers didn't jump but haven't had lasagna in a long time so we'll see how that goes with the sugar levels), jambalaya, gumbo, pot roast, baked chicken, pork chops. I'm hoping it's not too naive of me to assume I won't be too tired to warm up or sear some veggies real quick to go with the other foods mentioned above etc. Also my husband easily steps in if I'm too lazy to cook already so I doubt I'll be the one always making food for the both of us. As far as the hospital bag - I've started and stopped packing twice already bc there are thing's I still wear now that I will want to have with me then. I've got nipple cream and diaper cream (that's babys but I'm thinking I might use some if needed for sure,) an outfit and swaddle blanket for baby, a kimono type robe for me, some socks, lots of old funky granny panties (formerly period underwear on their way to getting retired lol.) We'll eventually throw in phone chargers, my makeup bag (which is basically colored chapstick and eyeliner/mascara) travel toiletries for shower teeth etc. I've got baby wipes and witch hazel wipes too just in case. I've also got a box of Altoids for when one of us might have stanky breath and get too close hehe. I've set aside a maxi dress and/or maxi skirt with a tank top to come home in and also a pj spaghetti strap empire waist short dress I usually hang around the house in for lounging in the hospital bed. I also have these two potato sack looking flowy shirts that my step mom got me from old navy. They're long like just over my butt and they're WAY too big but cute and very comfy so I figured I'll pack those too. They both make my boobs look like giant hanging torpedos though so I'll def be wearing the robe/bra with those. I haven't bought any nursing bras yet either bc my boobs haven't changed in size this whole pregnancy yet and I didn't wanna waste my money on a nursing bra when I don't know how big they'll get. I'm thinking I'll pack a few sports bras then get nursing ones after or just not wear a bra til I'm home. That's about all I can think of so far tho..sorry so long! :) Good luck :)"

I am fairly new to freezer meals so I bought some e-cookbooks from this website http://newleafwellness.biz. I am in no way affiliated but I used these books starting last Monday and I now have 31 dinners in my freezer, mostly ones that go straight into the crockpot. I liked that a lot of the recipes were no-cook in their preparation. Hope this helps."

BabyBumps,3dvnbu,MrsMoose7911,4,Sun Jul 19 22:24:12 2015 UTC,"This is a hard question to ask because you can get something as low as $100 or as high as thousands and thousands of dollars. For medical care it has to do with your location and your insurance. Totally out of pocket a regular birth can cost you 15k, but most people have insurance and aren't paying nearly that much. In terms of actual things, some people buy the minimum or just receive the minimum needed and get things second hand, while others go all out. Formula feeding with for sure add a couple hundred dollars a month for the first few months as well. Cloth diapering has a higher upfront cost, diapers has a regular monthly cost later on. Long story short, I would suggest writing a list of all your expenses. Call your insurance company and find out what to expect to pay, have a list of essentials you need, are you okay buying second hand or getting hand-me-downs, do you want a new basic crib, or a top of the line crib. People spend $100 on a new crib or $5k on a new crib. If you don't know how much an item will cost, look around on Amazon or Target and get an idea of what the average one will cost you..ect"

However, I personally went with the Chicco KeyFit 30 car seat.   It has a compatible stroller to click the car seat into and it's very convenient so I won't have to wake him up to transfer him to the stroller.  But the stroller is huge!    Check out lucieslist.com she reviews different strollers and car seat combinations and give you the pros and cons of each.   I think it's a great starting point."

BabyBumps,3dvnbu,orangething,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:37:36 2015 UTC,"Does the midwife not take insurance? We looked into a midwifery group that did not take insurance and their cost was 7k. This was for a hospital birth though, where the hospital would be covered under insurance. Recommendations for baby thugs are once again one of those things that are very subjective, you have to ask more specifics. Like I have a small car, what are the best car seats and stroller combos that can easily fit into a small trunk and back. For others, space isn't an issue, they want one with the best wheels because they walk a lot in all types of grounds and weather. Also, sometimes it's worth spending a little more if your planning on having more kids and would like to reuse as many items as possible. You can save money by mainly buying neutral color things to avoid having a boy in a bright pink stroller later on."
BabyBumps,3dvnbu,orangething,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:14:35 2015 UTC,"Most of them seem to, the issue is that we don't have any. My husbands company switched providers last Xmas and the new plan is quite a bit more expensive for a level that would be useful. So since at the time we weren't trying for a baby and because the rep I spoke to made it clear they're not real pro-midwife we kinda said ""screw it"". We'll definitely bite the bullet on it now that there's a kid in the mix but that's the story of why we're paying cash for a midwife. A couple of the midwife's sites I looked at also mentioned a break for cash payers, I just haven't called around yet because I didn't want to bother them until I'd done my research. We live in a little town that fancies itself Mini Seattle and things are accordingly expensive so I was trying to get a bead on what others were paying elsewhere so as to have a sense for whether the cost I'm being given is fair and how it compares to hospital costs. You're right about specifics, I'm sorry, I thought casting a wide opinion net would be better and ended up making it more complicated....story of my life. lol Anyways, we live in a tiny house and just bought a bigger one (about 400sqft, not counting a giant covered deck, set for Sept. delivery) that sits on my parents farm so there's plenty of 'outside' to be had but space indoors is at a premium. Space saving suggestions would be wonderful! As for the car, we've got a Subaru Forester that's 4 door and seems roomy to me but then I've never wrestled a car seat so I dunno. Spending more for an adjustable one that'll keep us from having to buy a second one later seems smart but again, this is my first rodeo so all opinions are welcome. I'm not sure about how many kids we'll have, to be honest I'm kind of a mess in terms of how I feel about this one so I honestly don't know if I'll meet this kid and then want a whole set or be so very done. That said, it seems prudent to spend a little more for stuff that'll last if for nothing more than it's re-sale value but I have a hard time deciding which products claims seem legit to me since I've got zero experience in baby thingology. Sorry for the huge post....but thank you SO much for your advice!"
BabyBumps,3dvnbu,MedusaGrey,2,Mon Jul 20 14:07:36 2015 UTC,"As another said, this varies SO widely. But I'll give you a breakdown of where we're at and our expected medical expenses at the moment. Maybe it will help. I'm also including numbers from my sister's raising of her babies monthly (formula based). I did some averaging. I will say some of hers includes diaper hoarding beforehand and formula at a discount because she's an amazing couponer and breastfed some as well.   Baby gear - close to $2k if not more. That's clothes, blankets, gear, strollers, medicines, washes, wipes, bottles, dishes, toys, playmats, bassinet, all that stuff. Plus I received a ton of diapers and wipes from showers. I'm not done yet either - he'll need his convertible carseat later, more toys, more clothes, toddler bed, more medicines, etc. And that's just by age 3.  Maternity clothes and stuff - $700 or so got me clothed and outfitted throughout. At 39w I've just about run out of outfits other than yoga pants and Maxi dresses though. And no shoes fit me hardly anymore.   Medical - $500 deductible, max out of pocket is $2k. I will pay that this year between l&d, OB, and anesthesia. We're already close to meeting the deductible through ultrasounds, medications, lab work, etc. We have excellent insurance thank god; without it the standard l&d cost at my hospital is $10k for regular and $22k for c-section. My hospital won't let you in without insurance or a $3k down payment if uninsured. They'll send you up the road 2 exits to a Catholic nonprofit.   Maternity leave - I get FMLA but company offers no leave pay. I'll get maybe $1k in pto pay since I took time during pregnancy for doc visits and such, and then 6 weeks at no more than 600 per week because I was able to sign up while pregnant (blessed). So another $3k received. I'll get $4k for 10 weeks - that leaves me short a good $4k. We've put that back and consider that a cost.   Monthly costs - this is our baby budget. $600 per month for daycare, $200 per month for diapers and formula (we have tons of diapers already), and another $200 per month for medical, clothes, toys, anything else. So baby will add $1000 per month to our spending."

BabyBumps,3dvpnz,MrTucker3,3,Sun Jul 19 22:43:26 2015 UTC,"We are going to continue to use Amazon for things like toilet paper, shampoo, etc.  Considering using Blue Apron (just like Plated but local) to have groceries for three meals a week delivered."
BabyBumps,3dvpnz,catsarethenewblack,2,Sun Jul 19 23:24:53 2015 UTC,I use Blue Apron and I LOVE it. I will use Blue Apron until the day I die. I have never been sent a bad tasting meal.
BabyBumps,3dvpnz,peachy_keen_bitches,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:31:34 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add a comment about Blue Apron - I really liked the ingredients and recipes they sent, but I found all the cooking to be time consuming (some meals took ~1hr). I think it's great if you want to immerse yourself in cooking (date night?), but I doubt it would be all that convenient with a newborn."
BabyBumps,3dvpnz,questionablecake,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:30:46 2015 UTC,I second this. I stopped doing BA in my first trimester. There's no way I would do it with a newborn.
BabyBumps,3dvpnz,emsbaby,2,Mon Jul 20 14:39:54 2015 UTC,"My in laws use a subscription service for non-grocery items like paper products, cleaners, trash bags, etc. They seem to enjoy it since they've used it for years. Sorry, I have zero experience with grocery services, but some local chains may set something up for you. It may depend on the store, however."
BabyBumps,3dvpnz,themadchild,2,Sun Jul 19 23:18:21 2015 UTC,"I've been doing online grocery shopping for about 5 years now and it's awesome.  We have 2 grocery stores locally that will deliver to our house and one tends to be more expensive than the other, so that's one thing to consider.  They also usually charge a delivery/service fee of $10-15 but if you're using something like Peapod with Stop and Shop you can get the first 2 months of delivery for free when you sign up.  And honestly, Peapod tends to be more expensive than regular grocery shopping overall (their prices are different from the stores) but for other stores like Shoprite it's actually about the same price to go to the store or do delivery.  Also, usually if you spend over $100 on groceries when you shop, you'll usually get $10-15 off of the delivery/service fee.  So yes, I will definitely be doing grocery delivery after the baby's born and continue indefinitely.  It's sooo much easier and more convenient."
BabyBumps,3dvpnz,Meghany21,2,Sun Jul 19 23:29:22 2015 UTC,"Oh god it sounds so heavenly. It's pretty cheap here, too so I think it will be worth it! I can just take it week by week until I'm ready to venture out into the world, right?"
BabyBumps,3dvpnz,Meghany21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:06:36 2015 UTC,Absolutely! You choose when you want it delivered. It doesn't have to be a weekly thing or biweekly or even monthly. And if you're strapped for groceries you can usually have it delivered the next day if you order before the cutoff time.
BabyBumps,3dvpnz,Meghany21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:32:34 2015 UTC,"Oh and they carry in everything heavy for you, which makes it even more awesome. I can't stress enough how awesome it is, haha."

I LOVED it. any friends that get pregnant, I will definatly steer them towards this. I didnt want to leave the house for about 2 weeks post delivery and this way I didnt have to :)"

I'd love to do it all the time, but I don't really need it. You can get everything you need from your computer. It's super-convenient and worth it if you won't have anyone to help you with the shopping. By the way, you don't have to pay for delivery necessarily. I had mine delivered, but you could have your husband pick up the groceries from the store to avoid the extra delivery charge."

BabyBumps,3dui7y,MR_icke,8,Sun Jul 19 18:09:34 2015 UTC,"I've been avoiding them as well (also had a real fear of the thought of childbirth prior to getting pregnant, which has practically gone away now).  That being said, I always ""peek"" at birth stories (usually skip to the very bottom to see the baby pics!) and have began to read bits and pieces, but still can't stomach traumatic birth stories.  Would rather keep a calm mind about it.  I'll admit though - I did cave and watch the viral of the woman giving birth in the car.  It actually made me cry and think HOLY SHIT I CAN DO THIS!  Not saying you should watch it, but it definitely wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  In fact, I really hope my birth goes that quickly and smoothly (though preferably in a hospital, not a car).    What's helped the most is simply talking to my doctor about what to expect and asking him all the ""what if something goes wrong"" questions.  He's been great about answering these things calmly and has let me know that no matter what, I'm in good hands.  I feel much better about the thought of having to have an emergency c-section, but also have peace of mind knowing that he is fully supportive of my wanting a natural birth and that I won't be pushed into having an unnecessary procedure."
BabyBumps,3dui7y,MR_icke,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:30:12 2015 UTC,"Haha I also skim/peek at the birth stories I do read. I'm going to start reading a positive story for every negative one I do happen upon, I think. Talking through the process with my midwife, touring the birth facility etc. should give me a lot of peace of mind, I just wish I knew all the questions I should be asking! I'm sure that's very Googleable though..."
BabyBumps,3dui7y,koh522,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:19:44 2015 UTC,"Do NOT Google it hahahaha.  It will probably come up with some horrible WebMD article ;)  I always think of new questions and just ask each time I go.  Basically, I told my OB ""This is what I am HOPING for, though I know I can't plan exactly how it will go"" and then asked him what circumstances call for a c-section, induction, etc.    I made sure I would have freedom to move around, switch positions, etc, and feel much more confident knowing I won't be strapped to a bed with my legs in stirrups.    Another question I made sure to ask was what their typical procedure is with the baby directly after birth.  Obviously it depends on how things go, but should I have an uncomplicated birth, they will place the baby directly on my chest, wait to cut the cord (my husband will be the one to cut it) and we will try breast feeding immediately.  I was worried they would just take my baby away to clean him up and I wouldn't get to see him for 15 minutes or so (thanks for that image, Hollywood).  And should anything happen to me or baby, my husband will go with baby.  They never separate the infants from their parents at this clinic - I love it!"
BabyBumps,3dui7y,koh522,2,Mon Jul 20 01:03:34 2015 UTC,"Those are great ideas of things to ask. Luckily my midwife clinic is very clear about their standard procedures - for instance, they practice delayed cord clamping unless you are donating the blood, they give you the baby for skin time immediately after, the lactation consultant visits you right away, etc. You can give birth in a variety of positions, and they will provide pain meds or support you in the event of an unmedicated birth. While having a song identity and cohesive approach, they also seem very flexible and accommodating if I do have special requests or concerns. It's a nice balance."
BabyBumps,3dui7y,rpsychnurse,4,Mon Jul 20 01:14:46 2015 UTC,"I had two peaceful, uneventful births that went precisely according to the birth plan. (Natural, unmedicated, vaginal - hospital location, one with an OB and one with a midwife.) Would be happy to dig them up for you if you'd like!"

BabyBumps,3dui7y,carolina_snowglobe,3,Sun Jul 19 23:47:06 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way! When we were TTC I actually read a fair amount of birth stories for some reason but since baby's conception I avoid them! I don't want to read negative/traumatic stories because I am already anxious enough and I don't want to read positive ones because I don't want to have unrealistic expectations of my birth. I still go back and forth between ""my body is made for this- no big deal"" and ""I will never be able to do this-oh my god!"". I like to think I'm getting less scared and more prepared but I don't think birth stories will help either way!"

If I had read a bunch of birth stories before I got pregnant, I might have gone right back on the pill, lol. Although I did read about a friend's VERY difficult birth on her blog back when we were trying, but I guess I thought those complications wouldn't likely affect me (she is VERY plus sized and that had scary consequences for her in the delivery room)."
BabyBumps,3dui7y,MorituriNolumusMori,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:58:58 2015 UTC,I'm curious to know how her weight caused her problems during delivery? I'm not plus sized but I've always wondered about this
BabyBumps,3dui7y,prolificsalo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:36:40 2015 UTC,"Obese women tend to have less effective contractions, so more induced labors, delivery complications, and unplanned C sections. This was the case for my friend. Both their epidural attempts failed and they couldn't get an IV in her. It was harder for them to monitor the baby during childbirth and they ended up figuring out that she needed a C section when it was almost too late - since through this process, her baby boy actually lost oxygen for several minutes. As far as they can tell he is completely fine now, over a year later, but at the time it was suuuuper scary."

BabyBumps,3dui7y,disenchantedprincess,2,Tue Jul 21 20:07:42 2015 UTC,"I was kind of the same way during pregnancy. I was ok with reading the stories (would often skip through parts that seemed overly terrible), but I refused to watch any videos of births or epidurals. Did NOT want to have those images playing on a loop in my head when I couldn't sleep at night. I had a c-section and never once thought, ""hmmm I really wish I had seen _______ on video before this happened."""
BabyBumps,3dui7y,MerMista,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:42:28 2015 UTC,That's great to know. I have wondered if afterwards I will wish I had watched a bunch of videos and read a bunch more stories...but I think I will just continue to follow my intuition on this. :)

I'm planning a home birth with a midwife and am very lucky that she has some past clients who have written their birth stories or even have videos. She has them hyperlinked on her website and honestly its so reassuring. I get to watch/read about my midwife in action, and even if the birth is difficult I feel okay about it because she handles things so well. I tried to find more home birth stories online though. Do not Google that. Do not."
BabyBumps,3dui7y,ifoundxaway,2,Sun Jul 19 18:53:56 2015 UTC,"LOL no idea...I know my husband is not really the ""put yourself in someone else's shoes"" type but after that I gave him a firm talking to about trying to imagine how he would feel if he were me, about to go through something so physically intense (and potentially dangerous). After that he was thoughtful so hopefully he gets it!  I'm giving birth with a midwife in a hospital - adjacent birthing center... I'll see if I can find some detailed testimonials from moms who have delivered there. Great idea!"
BabyBumps,3dui7y,BumpQuestions,2,Sun Jul 19 23:23:06 2015 UTC,"Yup, same here. I am reading all the stories on here, but have a no video rule. Before getting pregnant I was still in the ""I'm not super sure I want to do this baby thing"" mindset, primarily because of my fears about doctors, hospitals, and the whole shoving a human being through my bits thing. So, I thought educating myself would help. I was wrong.   The more I read, the more freaked out and uncertain I became. So I finally stopped reading and we stopped using protection, on the theory that if things just happened on their own, I'd handle it better than trying to force myself to make a firm decision. That worked. Ended up pregnant, happy about it, and somehow the idea that now childbirth is inevitable actually eased my fears. I still want to learn the basics(through reading only, no graphic pictures, no videos) so that I can make some decisions about how I want to approach things, but for the most part, I'm just plain more comfortable with things if I don't overload myself with info.  I am also refusing to watch that particular video, lol!"
BabyBumps,3dui7y,stardust1283,2,Sun Jul 19 19:05:14 2015 UTC,"the idea that childbirth is inevitable actually eased my fears   Exactly how I feel. Before I was like, can I really handle this childbirth thing? It seems so scary. Now I'm like, well, it's for sure happening, so let's do this thing."

BabyBumps,3dvxs9,WildKat53,2,Sun Jul 19 23:53:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to suggest to you to get this or that stroller but I do have some tips that may help you decide. Consider your mode of transportation. Is your car large or small? Some infant car seats are huge and can not fit into tiny cars. Also, the way the stroller folds up, will it fit into your trunk space? A Ford Explorer will have a bigger trunk space than say a Toyota Matrix. Or if you don't have a car and take public transportation, you may want to look into a lighter stroller/seat combo rather than a heavy one. Do you have an active lifestyle as oppose to a more sedentary lifestyle. They have those huge three wheel strollers, great for outdoors. They have the regular (and cheaper option) four wheel strollers great for just everyday and most are lighter and folds smaller than the joggers. Most stores have strollers on display where you can go check out and take apart (I do to see if it is easy to fold and how big it is)."
BabyBumps,3dvxs9,MAC_Sable_eyes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:32:14 2015 UTC,"We're getting the Britax B-Agile stroller and the infant seat adapter bar for non-Britax carriers. Our infant seat is a Graco Snugride 30, with bases in both of our cars.  When baby is big enough to be out of the infant seat, we have a Diono Ranier, which can extended rear-face and then become a forward facing seat and booster. The expiration on the Diono alone is something like 8-10 years, so we should be all set with those three things. Also, Target has the best price on the Britax, and the classic-connect Snugrides are on sale for under $100 in select colors."
BabyBumps,3dvxs9,Ampersandcastles_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:49:44 2015 UTC,"They really are mostly a personal choice thing.  To be able to be sold, they all have to meet the same safety requirements.    I was also getting overwhelmed, so when I saw a really great deal on a Keyfit 30 + stroller combo (at the sale price, the combo was cheaper than buying JUST the car seat alone at BRU!)  I snatched it up and was done with it!  Just make sure it fits in your car... I have a super tiny back seat (Ford Fiesta hatchback) so I went the BRU and tried out a few that I'd seen listed online as being reasonably short.  Still have to put the passenger seat pretty much all the way up, though!"
BabyBumps,3dvxs9,Shortkaik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:30:16 2015 UTC,"I bought the Graco Aire3 Click Connect Travel System: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M5PX4II/ref=sr_ph_1?m=ATVPDKIKX0DER  My husband and I went to Babies R Us and Target one weekend and tried pushing around pretty much all their strollers and looked at all the infant car seats. I have a Toyota Matrix and he has a Mazdaspeed3. Pretty much all seats will fit behind me (I'm 5'3) but not behind him (He's 6'3). So we looked for strollers that were light, easy to collapse, and easy to maneuver. I also asked around work and everyone seemed to agree with me that the 3 wheel strollers were the easiest to move around. The most stable 3 wheel stroller we found was the Britax B-agile. We also like the Baby Jogger City Mini but would only go that route if we found a good price as it was almost identical to the Britax. My husband wasn't a fan of the Britax b-safe 30 or the 35 or the 35 elite only because he like the fabric of the Chicco Keyfit 30 so much more. The 35 elite's huge infant head pad thing is also not removable. It's hard plastic behind it. Padding wise I thought both were fine. The Graco snugride 35 which comes with the Aire3 travel system had similar material (that rugged stuff) as the Chicco but not as much padding. Graco = $269 ish, Britax = $349 ish, Chicco Bravo system = $349 ish but Chicco Bravo was 4 wheels. So at Babies R US we really wanted the Chicco Keyfit 30 seat but the Britax stroller. Altogether it would cost about $400 after some sales and stuff plus cost of an adapter of maybe $20 clearance at Target. BUT then Amazon prime day happened and as I was super disappointed they only had the old Britax strollers and they weren't even that cheap, the Graco came up! Got it for $189 after taxes which was cheaper than a seat or stroller alone. It's currently $269.99 which is $100 more than that Amazon sale price but I think after getting it and setting it up I would still have bought it. The stroller is just as stable as the Britax, easy to fold, lightweight, comes with neoprene cup holder for baby, double plastic cup holder on handle for you and a zippered compartment, huge canopy that will cover the infant seat too, zippered canopy part that extends the canopy even more with a mesh so you can see the baby if you want, a peek a boo mesh part in the canopy if you don't want a full zippered mesh parts, full reclining stroller (good for quick diaper changes while you're out or if you need the stroller and don't have carseat around) and large tires. The carseat is very light and fits in my car too. The click connect is easy to use. The base for the carseat says it uses the latch system but on the bottom of the carseat is a ""locking clip"" for seatbelts. If you need to use the seatbelt instead, you can use that with the locking clip. You can also install the seat without the base at all. This is good for when you're in a friends car or taxi or even your family's second car. It's not as padded as the chicco, but rolled up receiving blankets on either side of the baby will work just fine! Value wise, I really recommend the Graco Aire3 travel system. But I also recommend you going to a couple stores, pushing the strollers around, collapsing them, lifting them, installing the seat in your car (Babies R Us lets you do this sometimes), and testing out the connecting system mechanism."
BabyBumps,3dvxs9,Tesalin,0,Mon Jul 20 16:37:51 2015 UTC,I got the graco click and connect (jogging stroller) because my sisters have the same stroller and I can use theirs and the car seat clicks into the stroller:
BabyBumps,3dvxs9,kams88,0,Sun Jul 19 23:56:54 2015 UTC,SO and I picked up a graco click connect combo (snugride 30 infant carseat/carrier and comfy cruiser stroller). It cost about $180 with tax. It is really easy to assemble and is pretty durable seeming even though it is lighweight. Has good reviews too 😊

BabyBumps,3dvxs9,__sesame__,0,Mon Jul 20 01:06:31 2015 UTC,"I bought the evenflo system because they had blue for 50% off at a place near me. (Ended up being $70).

BabyBumps,3dtvzg,PinkMonkeySlippers,30,Sun Jul 19 12:31:01 2015 UTC,"That sounds so frustrating. I think if she was helping out a lot/doing all the  cleaning, paying for her meals would be a nice gesture...but it's crazy that she expects to basically have an all inclusive vacation at your house for nothing right after you gave birth.  Have you talked to her at all?"
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,BananaBoggle,6,Sun Jul 19 12:49:06 2015 UTC,I know better then to let anyone stay with us to help. We don't love houseguest. Hope she goes home soon
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,tpmow,2,Sun Jul 19 13:59:39 2015 UTC,"We've talked to her about a few things, but it doesn't seem to sink in.  She leaves in two days...we're counting the hours."
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,ZisforZombie,20,Mon Jul 20 18:13:55 2015 UTC,"Hide the Kcups. Buy some cheap coffee and one of those $5 reusable Kcups. That might help with that issue.   The rest I have no advice for, I'm sorry. I hope her 10 days are almost up though!"
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,ZisforZombie,2,Sun Jul 19 14:53:12 2015 UTC,"I bought some cheap coffee and dragged out the old drip brewer.  She seemed disappointed, but oh well...at least she's not blowing through $10 worth of coffee a day."
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,snarklepop,3,Mon Jul 20 18:14:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's insane! Kcups are literally for the people who throw one in and then run out the door. Not to sit there and keep drinking. Way to expensive."
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,gullibletammy,36,Mon Jul 20 18:58:56 2015 UTC,"Have you been giving her specific jobs/tasks to do? ""Mom, can you load the dishes into the dishwasher so I can finish nursing baby?"" Is it possible she doesn't know what needs to be done?   She's there to help, so delegate as much as you can."
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,gullibletammy,11,Sun Jul 19 15:02:10 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I wouldn't wish that on anyone after it happened to me. Your story is EXACTLY the same as mine when I had my first baby. My mom lives 10 hours away and it was her first grandchild so she was adamant about staying with us after the baby arrived. Biggest hassle of my life. She got lost on the way into town, her cell was dead and calling from random pay phones because she forgot her phone charger. We had just gotten discharged from the hospital and home with the baby and my poor husband had to drive around town and find her. And on top of that she brought her very annoying and loud dog with her. My mom lives alone and it definitely has affected her social skills. She was just soooo needy and talkative and just not at all what I needed right after having my first baby. I'm so beyond happy that for my second, who's due any minute now that no one will be visiting."
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,catsalots,2,Sun Jul 19 15:10:30 2015 UTC,"Oh my goodness, that sounds awful...sucks that you had to go through that."
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,sotepetsenu,2,Mon Jul 20 18:15:13 2015 UTC,I'm sorry you did too. There's so much more I could add to what she did to completely ruin there experience but I didn't want to hijack you any more than I already did :P
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,catsalots,9,Mon Jul 20 18:20:29 2015 UTC,"My only fear when my mom comes is putting the top-only dishwasher items on the bottom. Please don't ruin my pyrex storage lids! I'm pretty controlling in the kitchen when it comes to where things go and cleaning things.   These things are considered ""petty"". What you are annoyed at is not! You shouldn't be responsible for housing and feeding another person right now at all. I'm sorry!"
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,sotepetsenu,2,Sun Jul 19 16:29:55 2015 UTC,"Destroying pyrex lids is not petty.  Can you even buy replacements for those?  If someone melted one of mine, they would need to be a gracious as fuck person who would forgive me for yelling obscenities at them and never apologizing.  So yeah, I'm pretty controlling in my kitchen too."
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,ashtrizzle,2,Mon Jul 20 20:54:55 2015 UTC,"Haha the thing is she's the kind of person that would not hesitate to buy me a new set if she accidentally ruined them.   I just looked it up and you can replace the lids! Through pyrex, but it looks like Amazon is cheaper (for the sizes I would need)."
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,LadyCatFeline,3,Mon Jul 20 22:40:00 2015 UTC,"Well dang, and then I would feel extra bad for yelling.  Great to know I can replace the lids!  We got ours last year while living in a place with no dishwasher, and just moved... with our new dishwasher still packaged up waiting to get installed :P  I'm hoping neither of us will ever need to replace the lids!"
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,cmcg1227,8,Mon Jul 20 23:44:32 2015 UTC,"I super feel for you. It seems like you need to remind her that she was there to help, yet hasn't provided any help at all. Maybe give her some sort of chore list so she knows exactly what she should be doing?"

MIL wanted to be there for the birth and after, we said no because I don't feel like I know her well enough, it's a very formal relationship and I'd be pretty uncomfortable with that. My mum lives in the UK and is better at giving alone time, but... lives in the UK.  I'd let a friend stay, because I'd confront a friend about this kinda shit! But that's why no MIL, I wouldn't feel comfortable asking for space or alone time, more help, etc etc"
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,cheekyuptowngirl,6,Sun Jul 19 14:33:42 2015 UTC,"I would actively suggest the things you want from her: ""mom can you please [throw in a load of laundry, load/unload the dishwasher, sweep the kitchen]? It would really help me out."" Then when you go out to eat, don't invite her. Say ""[SO] and I are going for dinner with the baby."" If you want alone time, you're probably going to have to suggest it...""Mom would you mind hanging out in your room for a while so we can have some alone time?"""

BabyBumps,3dtvzg,Oblivinatior,4,Mon Jul 20 18:16:40 2015 UTC,I can't really offer advise but to tell you I am feeling concerned about my MIL! She lives a block and half down the street and I just have this funny feeling that when LO arrives that she's just going to decide to randomly show up whenever she feels like it. My own mom lives 15 minutes away and her car is currently out of commission. My own mother would never make unannounced appearances because she knows I HATE it. I have myself all nervous of what's to come and know I'm going to freak the f out if ppl are arriving unannounced and expecting to be entertained!
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,tobiasvl,5,Sun Jul 19 16:15:30 2015 UTC,"If she comes by, your SO need to make it clear to her that she's not to do that, as you need your rest, etc. you can say it too, but it might be better coming from SO."
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,QuirkyQbana,3,Sun Jul 19 16:25:45 2015 UTC,"I read this article.

Mommy and baby are sleeping. Please call us and let us know when you would like to stop by so we can arrange for a time when we can all enjoy your company."""

UGH!"
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,browneyedgirl79,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:26:07 2015 UTC,Maybe be proactive? Let her know that you're more than happy for her to visit but she's just got to call first to make sure you're feeling up to it that day (plus are up and dressed). So you're telling her she's welcome but also that some days you're not going to want visitors.
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,sakurahorror,7,Mon Jul 20 07:24:19 2015 UTC,"She's staying with you?? Wow, right after we got our kid we almost didn't make it through the few lunch visits we got, and they just lasted a couple of hours each.   Anyway, she sounds a little quirky, but points 3 and 5 are extremely rude. Not only is she not helping, she's costing you extra money and not least work, which you don't need more of during this time."

BabyBumps,3dtvzg,PrimrosePlath,3,Sun Jul 19 14:40:23 2015 UTC,"That would all drive me completely up the wall, OP. You have every right to be frustrated. I am refusing all house guests for a month after the birth, for my own sanity and the health of the guests! For people on the fence, make sure you get a commitment on what ""help"" means before the guest arrives. Lots of people want to ""help"" after the birth so try to get them to expand on that before you agree to open your home to them during such a fragile time. To some people help means simply the gift of their company and holding the baby once or twice. Be warned!"
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,EFIW1560,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:13:12 2015 UTC,"She was very specific on the phone months ago that she wanted to help by doing dishes, dusting, etc.  She's done nothing but sit around all day drinking coffee and talking to the point I'm shocked her voice hasn't given out.  I mean, I love my Mom, but everyone's got their limits, you know?"
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,meepmeep1357,3,Mon Jul 20 18:19:35 2015 UTC,"We absolutely LOVED having my MiL here while I was in the hospital having Savannah and for a week after.  I can't even remember that week, but I do know that there was a LOT of food in our freezer after she left, and our house was spotless.  I'm sorry your Mom is being like that.  My Mom is coming from August 2nd-11th and I know she will be really helpful.  She hasn't seen Savannah yet in person, and I know it will be hard for her to put her down."
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,sea_warrior,6,Mon Jul 20 00:09:13 2015 UTC,"My toddler had a heart procedure and I was due 9 days after that, so my mom came early to help. She ended up staying almost a month (which was fine with me!). She was helpful in keeping my toddler occupied and letting me bond with the new baby, and also took all the overnight stuff for the toddler (toddler didn't sleep through the night until a few weeks after the new baby began sttn). She helped clean (or at least occupied toddler so I could clean, which is actually preferable because I use cleaning as a way to destress).   If my MIL had come... Yea, no, I'd have gone bonkers and stabbed someone."
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,mischiefmanaged613,2,Sun Jul 19 15:16:20 2015 UTC,It must have been so stressful to have your toddler have a procedure so close to your due date! Mine is possibly going to have a minor day surgery for an umbilical hernia around when baby is due and I'm having nightmares that I'll go into labour when she's having the surgery.
BabyBumps,3dtvzg,k2p2,4,Sun Jul 19 19:20:56 2015 UTC,"It was a cath lab procedure, not open heart (that was when I was 10 weeks pregnant...), so at least there's that...

I have been drinking the tea for like three weeks :( I would also like to know if pumping would help!!
BabyBumps,3dvb7k,Oatroot,3,Sun Jul 19 21:12:28 2015 UTC,It definitely does not bring in labor and is considered safe for the whole term because it doesn't. It just helps the uterus out.  We actually buy it in bulk for our dairy goats. All our girls get a few table spoons a day for their whole pregnancy. Haven't had a birthing issue once with it. knock on wood

I mean, I know the first three weeks are the hardest and I know every experience is different, but in the hospital when I go to breastfeed for the very first time, is it going to be excruciating?"
BabyBumps,3dv349,themadchild,4,Mon Jul 20 11:25:23 2015 UTC,How.. how normal is it to feel like you have to pee all the time at 30 weeks? I get up 4-6x a night if I'm hydrated. Sometimes when I'm done going I still lightly feel like I have to go? The amount can vary greatly. Sometimes it's only like.. a few tablespoons. Other times it feels like a normal pre-pregnancy amount!
BabyBumps,3dv349,ginakirsch,3,Sun Jul 19 20:43:04 2015 UTC,Normal. Blame the baby.
BabyBumps,3dv349,joyful5678,3,Mon Jul 20 01:30:54 2015 UTC,"My entire pregnancy ive been getting up alot to pee. Varies from 15 mins intervals to 30, 45, and 1h. Overnight sometimes if im lucky i go 2h without peeing but thats rare. And i dont even drink the recommended 8 glasses a day... So yeah i think 4-6 times in a night is fine, i even wish i peed so little, but thats solely based on my crazy pee-all-the-time experience lol"
BabyBumps,3dv349,Axenus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"Must be normal...I'm also due Sep 30 and  Mmy sort of funny/sarcastic question was going to be ""What IS the world record for max number of times one person can pee in a day?"" (Because I think I'm breaking it)   :)"
BabyBumps,3dv349,Wioffi,0,Mon Jul 20 05:29:52 2015 UTC,"I've always been a pee-er lol. But sometimes it's really frequent. I rock back and forth on the toilet to squeeze every drop and that helps somewhat. I also ""sleep pee"" as in I get up to go to the washroom without waking up (thank you body for being so well trained). But one night I had to pee so many times my lady parts were sore from wiping lol"
BabyBumps,3dv349,Axenus,2,Sun Jul 19 22:17:21 2015 UTC,"I can't figure out baby clothes sizes. I got 2 boxes full of clothes with different sizes. Some of the onesies are labeled as 12mos, but they look smaller than other onesies that are 6mos (different brands).  I'm trying to figure out how I can sort and store them (rolled/folded, not hung), I don't have to go through all of them every time my baby grows bigger.  I have no idea what babies look like at different ages, and I want to store all the 0-3 clothes in a drawer to make changing easier..  Any advice?"
BabyBumps,3dv349,snailien,6,Sun Jul 19 19:56:58 2015 UTC,"Google brand name and size chart. They will usually be done by weight. Then you can figure out what sizes with one brand go with what sizes with another. Helpful brands tell you the weight on the tag, but that seems to be rare."
BabyBumps,3dv349,PinkleopardPJ,2,Sun Jul 19 19:59:00 2015 UTC,"So if there's no brand information online, and they don't say weight on the tag do we compare lengths/ widths with other onesies to put them with similar sizes?  I have a bunch of stuff from who-knows-where I'm trying to organize and there's no information and they're considerably different lengths than others of ""same size"". @_@  Once they're washed can I just compare them to eachother? Or is there still going to be a dramatically different fit?"
BabyBumps,3dv349,koh522,2,Sun Jul 19 22:14:35 2015 UTC,"I'm getting a new apartment soon and it's looking like I'll be in a 1bdr (860 sq ft) for the first year. I know newborns don't really need a nursery or a ton of space at first, but I'm not entirely set on sleeping arrangements. I'm putting a bassinet on my registry, but I'm wondering if I should also accept a hand-me-down crib to keep for when she gets bigger. I can probably stick the crib in storage with my parents for the year if need be, but I'm just not sure if I'll want it sooner. Any thoughts? Thanks. ☺️"
BabyBumps,3dv349,blabbypopper,2,Sun Jul 19 20:20:58 2015 UTC,"We lived in an 800 sq ft one bedroom apartment for the first 18 months of my son's life. We had a bassinet for when he was tiny, then he slept in a pack n play (which is smaller than a crib), then we finally assembled the crib when he was about a year old. But the crib stayed in storage until then so I'd say if you're cool with it, wait on getting a crib or plan on storing it for a while."
BabyBumps,3dv349,fullmetaljacki,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:26:21 2015 UTC,"We co-sleep and I breastfed my kids until 18 months, BUT, I have never used a crib. Your arrangements may differ, if course, but that was my experience.  If the crib is free, isn't recalled, and you have a place to store it, I would accept it and move on. 😃"
BabyBumps,3dv349,fussandfeathers,2,Mon Jul 20 01:22:09 2015 UTC,"Gliders. My husband asked why I wanted one and I said we needed one. He asked why...and I didn't know. Lol. From what I've read, they make for an easy soothing method with minimal effort. Am I missing anything else that makes them useful?"
BabyBumps,3dv349,fullmetaljacki,2,Sun Jul 19 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"If you set it in a quiet room you can make dark it makes feeding a curious baby much less stressful. Dont give them stimulation and they are more likely to feed.  I never had a glider. I just lay in my bed with lights out and fed baby laying next to me, usually worked fine."

BabyBumps,3dv349,sat0123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:30:02 2015 UTC,I've been camped out on the couch trying not to word vomit on my partner.
BabyBumps,3dv349,Savannah94,2,Mon Jul 20 01:33:39 2015 UTC,"It's different for everyone, but what worked best for me is eating a bit of protein every 1-2 hours. My go to snacks are string cheese, little home-made bean and cheese burritos, banana with peanut butter, or a handfull of almonds. It didn't cure the morning sickness, but it made it tolerable. I also had a prescription for Diclegis which helped a lot too."
BabyBumps,3dv349,LilCuppincake,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:08:55 2015 UTC,I'm going to try some of those!  What's that prescription?
BabyBumps,3dv349,sat0123,2,Sun Jul 19 23:21:26 2015 UTC,"Diclegis is a prescription that's essentially vitamin B6 and doxylamine, which is found in Unisom SleepTabs.  When I started having morning sickness, my doctor recommended just straight B6 - I think she recommended 10mg, but I could only find 100mg tablets so I took quarters of them.  For whatever reason, that didn't help as much as actual Diclegis did.  You take Diclegis 2-3 times a day, regardless of whether you're having active symptoms, and it's longer-release.  When Diclegis stopped being enough for me, they put me on Zofran, which is what they prescribe for women with hyperemesis gravidarum (what Kate Middleton had) and to chemo patients.  You take Zofran right when you feel like you're going to throw up.  If you're feeling nauseous right when you get up, keep some saltine crackers by your bed and eat a couple before you get out of bed.  Some women think citrus helps too, either eating or smelling an orange."
BabyBumps,3dv349,Savannah94,2,Sun Jul 19 23:42:36 2015 UTC,Oh wow I didn't know that.  I'm going to talk to my obgyn and see what she recommends so I'm not taking something she doesn't want me to.
BabyBumps,3dv349,Empiricalbaker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:00:19 2015 UTC,"With the Diclegis, I ended up taking 2 pills at bedtime, then 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon. They were very expensive (insurance didn't cover it) so when I ran out, I just ended up taking Unisom and B6 at bedtime. My ""morning"" sickness is seeming to ease up a bit now, though I still hurl whenever I smell chicken."
BabyBumps,3dv349,sat0123,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:52:30 2015 UTC,"I also took two at bedtime and one in the morning.  The instructions said I could up it to 3 and 2, but when I was still complaining, they just upped me to Zofran.  My insurance covered the Diclegis, but the copay was still $40 or something like that.  Seems ridiculous for a medicine that's been around since the 1950s - and that was for the generic!  24 weeks today, and I haven't taken Zofran in a week.  Crossing my fingers that I've finally gotten over that mess."
BabyBumps,3dv349,pregball,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:56:53 2015 UTC,I don't know what my obgyn will say but I'm going to take all of the advice that I can get.  I take a prenatal vitamin which has B6 in it so I have that base covered.  Oh I keep having the same dream.
BabyBumps,3dv349,Savannah94,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:31:00 2015 UTC,"Solgar makes a 25mg B6.  Unfortunately, 10mg B6 is not available in the US, which seems silly and a missed market!  Especially since 100mg is about where bag things can start happening."
BabyBumps,3dv349,pregball,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:11:44 2015 UTC,"Yea, I took about 150mg for a couple days in a row til I looked up the maximum recommended dose, and then seriously began wondering why they sell 100mg pills.  If you can normally get B6 from food, it seems like it'd become pretty easy to overdose by taking a 100mg supplement."
BabyBumps,3dv349,Savannah94,2,Mon Jul 20 00:16:55 2015 UTC,"I'm on promethazine, which has been a lifesaver.  I asked for zofran after reading about it on this sub, and my midwife said she no longer prescribes it because a study linked it to birth defects...whatever, one study doesn't mean it isn't safe.  But I'm so so happy with promethazine.  And unlike the Diclegis some other ladies are talking about, insurance does cover it."
BabyBumps,3dv349,pregball,2,Mon Jul 20 01:00:46 2015 UTC,Did you have any side effects on the promethazine or zofran?  That's kind of concerning that there is that study.
BabyBumps,3dv349,Savannah94,2,Mon Jul 20 01:24:45 2015 UTC,"Oh, I was never on Zofran.  I just meant that I read about Zofran on this sub, called my midwife to ask for a prescription, and she said she does not prescribe it anymore on account of the study.  Then she recommended Promethazine and gave me the prescription.  Promethazine does have the side effect of drowsiness - I usually take a half pill and I feel totally fine even if I'm at work or doing chores or something.  But if I take it at night, I'll usually take a whole pill and I do feel it makes me sleep more deeply.  If it's the weekend, I usually sleep an hour later if I have taken Promethazine the night before.  Also my nurse friend said that almost all antinausea meds will make you constipated, even though this isn't listed as a side effect of Promethazine.  But yeah...I've been pretty constipated.    For me, morning sickness was basically taking over my life.  I was sitting at work doing absolutely nothing, staring at my keyboard just trying not to barf.  Promethazine lets me be a functional human being.  I would definitely recommend it."
BabyBumps,3dv349,pregball,2,Mon Jul 20 02:12:41 2015 UTC,That sounds like the one to ask for then.  The constipated part doesn't sound like fun but at this point I'm desperate to be a functional human as you said.  The drowsiness I can deal with even if its not fun to have.  I appreciate you helping me to get out of the morning sickness.  I know my partner is ready for me to be better.
BabyBumps,3dv349,crystlgrn,2,Mon Jul 20 03:13:16 2015 UTC,"Good luck!  Just FYI, I did not even have to go in to my midwife's office - I just called her, explained the morning sickness and asked for a prescription.  She called it in to my pharmacy and I went to pick it up immediately."
BabyBumps,3dv349,desles,2,Mon Jul 20 12:13:23 2015 UTC,I called and she prescribed promethazine.  She sent it electronically to the pharmacy.  I already picked it up.  Here's to hoping it helps me.  What's the difference between a midwife and ob?
BabyBumps,3dv349,stardust1283,2,Mon Jul 20 14:05:25 2015 UTC,"Awesome, it's so nice just getting what you need without having to go in to the office.  A midwife is a nurse who is specially trained in caring for pregnant moms and delivering babies, and an OB (obstetrician) is pretty much the same but is a trained M.D. (doctor) and can deliver babies surgically via C-section.    Outside of the U.S., midwives are MUCH more popular because people feel that in a normal pregnancy, having an OB care for you is not necessary because the OB's special training will not come in to play if you have a normal birth.  But within the U.S., OB's are a lot more common.  I was given the choice between a midwife and an OB and I chose a midwife.  If they find any abnormal issues with my pregnancy I will switch to an OB."
BabyBumps,3dv349,pregball,2,Mon Jul 20 14:27:56 2015 UTC,Any suggestions on a good twin stroller/carseat combo? We don't have many baby stores in my area so target is my best option. I've been looking online but it's hard to tell how well carseats will fit in some of the double strollers.
BabyBumps,3dv349,Brittaniii17,2,Mon Jul 20 00:57:44 2015 UTC,24 weeks. My nipples keep peeling. Is this normal?

I got SPD this week and that's made me mobility limited, which sucks because before I was trying to be super active. Any induction methods that you guys have that may really work?

BabyBumps,3dv349,whatgoesup56,2,Mon Jul 20 01:53:45 2015 UTC,I have my first ultrasound (will be the very start of Week 13) on Wednesday and I'm so nervous.  I'm also getting the Verifi genetic screening test.  I've had so much anxiety that something is going to be wrong with the baby; I just can't wait for it to be over.
BabyBumps,3dv349,rookiebrookie,2,Mon Jul 20 02:38:20 2015 UTC,Is nearly 27 weeks too early to feel him in my ribs every once in a while? I feel like I'm starting to sort of feel him move rather than just jab me. I'm curious if it's Baby I'm feeling up that high or just my insides squishing around.
