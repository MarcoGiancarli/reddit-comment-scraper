ImaginaryAstronauts,3bsz7z,chaispicetea,8,Wed Jul 1 22:08:59 2015 UTC,"Blurb from the artist's website:  When experiments testing the viability of tapping into the quantum vacuum for energy were performed on the Apollo 21 Lab Station, reports devolved into strange ramblings about how their conclusions were inconceivable to human minds. Before all communication ceased, garbled messages were sent to earth from the astronauts about their experiments revealing to them the ""howling face of the sun."" A rescue crew was violently repulsed from the station by corpses in the astronaut's space suits. Footage of the incident show ghostly images of tormented figures hanging just behind these corpses, struggling, but seemingly unable to pull themselves apart from their decaying bodies.  Link to author's website. Nothing else is space-related but it's creepily awesome."

Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night.  Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night.  Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  And you, my father, there on the sad height, Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

That's all he has left. 25 secs to get inside the hub, cycle the lock, scramble inside and try to make his way into the RV. He doesn't know the state of things on the other side of the hatch. Shards of glass float everywhere, but he can see the tiny port on the hatch still intact which means that whatever's blown the glass must be somewhere else inside the hub. So there might not be much atmosphere inside. And all he has is 25 seconds worth of O2 in the suit. After that he would have an additional 30 secs until loss of consciousness due to hypoxia but under those conditions he wouldn't be very effective. Too many unknowns. The RV could be in need to service without fuel or O2 canisters or even worse, without a flight profile uploaded yet. It could be stuck, unable to detach from the coupler which could be damaged or without power. The hub could be on fire. There could be another explosion while he was transiting through it. Right now there where a million ways this day could get worse. It didn't look promising.  But he would be damned it he is going to just sit and let himself die.

ImaginaryAstronauts,2cvsdb,AwwHellChewbacca,1 point,Thu Aug 7 13:50:10 2014 UTC,Maybe she is a badass and is about to smoke a motherfucker without even looking at him. Did you ever think about that?

ImaginaryAstronauts,27b57h,karmicviolence,2,Wed Jun 4 17:57:05 2014 UTC,"For over 4 years object S31 has remained in a stable Geosynchronous Orbit around Earth. It is theorised that the object possesses massive intelligence. No effort of communication has been successful since its initial arrival where it emitted an intense display of light in response to the orbital approach of the International Space Station.   Very little is actually known about Object S31. It is the topic of much international debate and tension as to how to next proceed. It is still unclear as to what the object's intentions are. It is theorised that the object is in fact one singular organism of intelligent design (created by some other intelligent life form) yet this too is the subject of much heated debate.   Though there has been no official go ahead for any nation to further attempt communication, the International Space Station has remained locked in orbit beneath it since its arrival. Due to this, the space station has rapidly under gone hardware re-purposing to make it more efficient at close range studies.*"
