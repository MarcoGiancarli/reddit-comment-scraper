FreeGamesOnSteam,392i1g,NickNacPattyWac,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:45:32 2015 UTC,Because a beta key only gives you access to beta...

FreeGamesOnSteam,38aatg,legendprotocol,4,Tue Jun 2 22:23:35 2015 UTC,As far as free games go this one is really good. Mainly because it is what it is. It's just a bunch of jigsaw puzzles relatively relaxing brainless thing to pass time with. It's not perfect or the best virtual jigsaw dealy but it functions just fine. Would recommend. Mainly cause it's free.

Unfortunately after the time that it would take to sign in to your separate facebook account, you would have reached the point where the effort required to get a steam key doesn't outweigh how awful the game looks. In all honesty you are better off just not wasting the effort on a 2003 game.  I still want to thank the OP though for posting this, we all appreciate it."

FreeGamesOnSteam,33mib9,drewmb10,7,Thu Apr 23 18:54:28 2015 UTC,what's the point of the game key when the game can be downloaded for free this time on steam? will the game be playable even after the open beta period if a key has been used?
FreeGamesOnSteam,33mib9,kexmester,0,Thu Apr 23 19:44:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's only free to play for until the beta ends, and then you have to pay on steam, while with this you keep it."
FreeGamesOnSteam,33mib9,YepNepDep,4,Thu Apr 23 21:36:54 2015 UTC,That's not how the developer explained it on the Steam forums (or at least not how I understood it). That sounded like everyone gets das boot after the 2 week beta.  http://steamcommunity.com/app/263060/discussions/0/618459931322275412/
FreeGamesOnSteam,33mib9,WNW3,2,Fri Apr 24 16:58:10 2015 UTC,"I don't see how we will get to keep it. When I redeemed the code it never bounded to my Library, the same as if you would click Play on the open beta button on Steam."
FreeGamesOnSteam,33mib9,TakiSQ,2,Fri Apr 24 14:59:07 2015 UTC,I got the key and then added it to my account.  in account details it now says:  Item                        Acquisition Method  Blockstorm Open Beta        Retail
FreeGamesOnSteam,33mib9,xTkAx,3,Fri Apr 24 19:45:18 2015 UTC,"Try uninstalling it. You won't find it in your Library anymore. As for account details, everything appears there even F2P and Free Weekend games."
FreeGamesOnSteam,33mib9,TakiSQ,2,Fri Apr 24 21:14:40 2015 UTC,you're right!  learn something every day!  thx! :D     but when i go to the block storm store page it says it is already in my library.  is this just slow to update in the steam client?
FreeGamesOnSteam,33mib9,xTkAx,3,Sat Apr 25 12:12:13 2015 UTC,"Saying in the Store Page that it is in your Library is also something that happens for Free Weekend and F2P games but as soon as it ends, you remove it, it won't be on your Library.  But I am guessing it's the same case as with the Fractured Space thing, when the free play/free weekend/free 2 weeks end you get to keep it if you have it installed, that's just my guess."
FreeGamesOnSteam,33mib9,TakiSQ,3,Sat Apr 25 17:15:57 2015 UTC,"On the far right tab called 'Open Beta', just enter your email to get the Steam key!"

FreeGamesOnSteam,2xcnvs,Vincent2128,1 point,Sun Mar 1 14:08:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but I suppose it depends on the company holding the particular betas.  They count in Steam Library as a game if on Steam, and I think some betas I've been in did give out keys after, or just updated to a regular version from the beta.    Other ones I participated in definitely didn't give anything of monetary value, though some have given me in-game trinkets and things for participating that people couldn't have after the fact.    Not sure where or how to find that information out though in these cases."
FreeGamesOnSteam,2xcnvs,wishywashywonka,3,Sat Feb 28 00:20:18 2015 UTC,"Just a note the title of this post is wrong, the game is called Total War Battles: KINGDOM.  I've signed up for the BETA and will post if accepted, not sure how likely it is since they wanted to know a pretty unreasonable amount of personal information and I didn't give them entirely truthful answers (full name, date of birth, mailing address).  No word on when the beta keys will be released, the FAQ says soon though.  Updates on their facebook page are very frequent which is nice for anyone keeping an eye on the game, they post status/concept updates 1-5 times a week."

FreeGamesOnSteam,2x5s3n,jakeman77,2,Sat Feb 28 16:36:08 2015 UTC,"Shadowbans are used on account that may be spammers. IIRC, t's an automated process, so it obviously makes mistakes.  Also, as far as I know, all the others actions that break the rules get you a normal ban."
FreeGamesOnSteam,2x5s3n,WNW3,2,Sat Feb 28 18:23:22 2015 UTC,"I see, that makes sense. Thanks for the response.  What's the point in using a shadowban, as opposed to a normal ban?"
FreeGamesOnSteam,2x5s3n,wishywashywonka,2,Sat Feb 28 18:36:45 2015 UTC,"It takes longer for the spammer to notice that they are banned.  If you are shadowbanned, you can still comment, submit posts and vote, but other redditors will not see your comments/votes,  The only person who can see their posts are the moderators of the subreddit he's in. We can also approve their comments, one by one, if we want.    Basically, it makes them lose their time spamming invisible posts, only seeen by themselves and the mods."
FreeGamesOnSteam,2x5s3n,Hexcellion,2,Sat Feb 28 19:01:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That makes a lot of sense now. In my three years of being on Reddit, I never learned about shadowbanning. Thanks for the explanation!"

I finally found where to get the keys for the other free games, buried underneath my profile preferences, by accident.  However, whenever I click on the blue ""Get your Steam Game here"" button, it opens up my Steam page in a new tab ... and nothing else happens.   ETA Ok, I found the Two Worlds button at the bottom of the games list. And I think the issue with Enclave was because it turns out I already have the game."
FreeGamesOnSteam,2q9x4k,HasNoFeels,3,Wed Dec 24 15:54:39 2014 UTC,"Also, if a page comes up that says all keys have been taken, try the blue button again. It can take a number of attempts before it goes through."

FreeGamesOnSteam,2q9x4k,drid3r,4,Wed Dec 24 16:24:38 2014 UTC,Remember that there is a hourly key limit just try again every hour or so and youll get the game :)
FreeGamesOnSteam,2q9x4k,nenjiavero,2,Wed Dec 24 13:12:51 2014 UTC,Thanks :)  Does the game have co-op?
