vintageaudio,3e55ol,Slickrick1688,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:22:15 2015 UTC,As I understand it the master tapes that vinyls are pressed from are on r2r tapes so the format itself is about as good as it gets in analog. This particular tape deck is for home use from 1968 so not nearly as good as some of the studio decks from the late 70s early 80s. But still fun to use and now I have an excuse to start collecting tapes while a save up for a better deck!

I'm working on cleaning and setting everything up as well as I can, but everything is in great shape, the speakers work, cabinets are good, grills are good, and the table holds speed.

vintageaudio,3dz25u,Slickrick1688,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:44:44 2015 UTC,"thanks!    I bought an LED / bulb kit on ebay     I replaced all the blue fuse type LEDs myself.  It was kind of a pain in the ass, but definitely doable.    I don't have a soldering kit, so I had a local shop do the reg bulbs (red stereo and yellow phono).  I assume it's not very hard but I needed maintenance on my receiver anyway.    I also bought the missing button on ebay.   The wood case I found an ebayer seller who makes replica cabinets.  He is also on audiokarma.org.  He did an amazing job and it looks great.  I can give you his email if you are interested in a somewhat cheap and beautiful case."
vintageaudio,3e0i48,indirobomoore,2,Tue Jul 21 00:40:24 2015 UTC,"Typical turn on rush hitting the speakers. New caps are needed. A short term solution would be to turn off speakers before powering up unit, assuming this sansui has that option, waiting 30s to a min then engaging speakers.  Swing over to audiokarma. I'm sure someone over there has recapped your model of receiver and would be glad to help."
vintageaudio,3e0i48,pioneertele,2,Tue Jul 21 05:18:26 2015 UTC,Bias adjustment on these old Sansui sets needs to be done with care and an ammeter in series with the quick acting fuses.  DC offset is fixed on this particular model and bias should be set to 10mA flowing through the quick acting fuse with no signal and no load present.
vintageaudio,3e0i48,madscientistEE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:08 2015 UTC,"Although bad caps are a distinct possibility, the receiver definitely probably needs adjustment for DC bias and quiescent current.  This is a fairly easy task that can be accomplished with the service manual from HifiEngine, a screwdriver, and a multimeter.  EDIT: Apparently this one uses a single-sided internal power supply with capacitors to couple to the speakers.  What this means is that, simply due to the original design of the receiver, there will practically always be a thump when turning it on.  It's possible that replacement capacitors will reduce the thump, but honestly it's something I just wouldn't worry about.  That said, it would do good to check that the current through the quick-acting fuse (as described by /u/madscientistEE) is in spec."

vintageaudio,3dw3vw,saratogacv60,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:55:26 2015 UTC,"There must be a disconnect between what is sitting in warehouses and what has been made available for sale.  I am noticing some rapidly rising prices for 10 inch reels this past year.  7 inch reels do not appear to be an issue as they are still relatively cheap.  It is the higher quality tapes such as the EE Extended Range tapes that increased to $30 and beyond for 10 inch reels in the retail market.    ATR Magnetics in France and Jai Industries in India appear to be the only remaining tape manufacturers left with current production facilities.  I hear that another European manufacturer may come online this year but even with this new capacity, the 10 inch reels are being sold for $37 each at MSRP.  If you know of a seller of EE tape in 10.5 inch reels at a decent price, I would recommend that you take advantage of that now since these tapes are no longer made by any of the current production facilities."
vintageaudio,3dw3vw,LaserRanger,3,Wed Jul 22 06:09:35 2015 UTC,"I was going to say the same. For the last few years, a lot of new indie releases have been on tape. I've seen prices of nice tape players continue to rise online as well.   I am heading back to CDs. Vinyl has become too expensive (I am still buying new vinyl, just not as much). A new CD sells for about as much as the digital download, and I get a physical copy of something with artwork.

vintageaudio,3dw3vw,swampnuts,-1,Wed Jul 22 10:20:59 2015 UTC,"Heck no.  8-tracks and cassettes were all over the place when I was growing up.  Lots of vinyl and some reel-to-reel, too.  I have many memories of cassette players eating tapes.  I do not want to go back to that.  I got back into vinyl several years ago, but my turntable is going up for sale to pay for a nice CNC machine.  All the good used records have either disappeared or been marked up a whole lot.  New records are often ridiculously expensive.  I'm out.  I don't like mechanical reproduction.  There are too many variables at play which makes good reproduction difficult.  Plus tape degrades and maintaining tape gear can be quite expensive.  Further, parts for tape machines can be difficult to find.  Why are people so opposed to digital?  We've gone far beyond mechanical devices (including CD players) and digital can produce excellent results.  Further, a decent DAC is cheap today and digital storage gets cheaper and bigger constantly.  Which is why I've moved everything to a digital server.  Access is so much easier and it really sounds good.  I still have a radio tuner, but I'm even thinking about selling that since I like streaming.  I hope these legacy format fads go away.  My firm opinion is that music should come before the format and you should put as much money as possible into the best speakers you can buy or build.  If you have good music and good speakers, everything else is secondary.  Music and speakers will make you a lot happier than a collection will."

The 42-tube Magnavox Concert Grand came in several different cabinets and a few were pretty dark. I always figured the more expensive stuff had to be offered in traditional aesthetics to appeal to older consumers with more disposable income.

vintageaudio,3dv5o9,captainbodacious,4,Sun Jul 19 19:53:42 2015 UTC,"150 for that receiver is a good price. I'd buy one for that, if it's in nice shape and fully functional. You can definitely get your money back out at that price. It has a stellar phono stage - very open and airy, and will pair nicely with mid to higher end cartridges and stylii. You won't be disappointed unless you're pairing it with a garbage cartridge or shot stylus. I have an sx780 in collection and it is one of shining stars as well as my daily driver.   Put a good mid level cart and stylus in that tt and you have a great setup. Technics tts are usually pretty well respected. Just don't skimp on the cartridge and stylus. Garbage in, garbage out!"
vintageaudio,3dv5o9,LoganPhyve,2,Sun Jul 19 22:56:52 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. A very fair price for an excellent receiver. Although I never owned a 780, I used a 680 (which Ive kept as a backup now that I have a 7800) which is very similar in comparison. You'll love it."
vintageaudio,3dv5o9,TheLastGovernment,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:06:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I really appreciate the input here. As a beginner, I have to ask do you have any recommendations for decent (cheapish?) mid level cartridges and stylii? I won't skimp on quality but also don't have access to a fortune to put this together. Once again, thanks a ton ya'll."
vintageaudio,3dv5o9,ohbehavekenobi,2,Mon Jul 20 02:12:35 2015 UTC,"Usually the relationship between speaker and receiver is more important.  I would buy the 780 for $150 if everything works properly and no one here will tell you different.  For speakers, KLH Model 6 or Large Advents will be around $100-200 if you hunt a little.  Massive, quality sound for entry level.  I'm not sure about the specific pairing of these and the 780 because I haven't repaired mine yet and I know the KLH Model 6 is power hungry.. they sound massive on my Yahama 100wpc receiver.  Also, whatever vintage speakers you buy make sure they can be opened somehow to replace capacitors; its essential."
vintageaudio,3dv5o9,ohbehavekenobi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:02:08 2015 UTC,Really appreciate the help here. I'm looking at a pair of Baby Advent II's for $65 that would be ideal for the bedroom setup I'm looking to build. Seller says the foam has been recently redone but I'll certainly I vestige the capacitors. Do you have any further recommendations for things I should look out for when I examine this receiver?

vintageaudio,3dtc5h,antihero,2,Sun Jul 19 06:48:51 2015 UTC,You can use pretty much anything as long as it gives you about 50-60 watts or more in 8 ohms.

vintageaudio,3dt9x8,meecrob11,2,Sun Jul 19 06:14:27 2015 UTC,"I’ve made this post for a couple of reasons.  One, to show off :) But also to see if anyone uses the same components and I guess to help anyone who maybe in the future comes across these components and finds themselves in the same position as me and just want more info.  Marantz Model 22, era 1969 - Here in Australia, Marantz receivers were popular, but not as popular as they are in the states, most vintage receivers are like old technics systems or low watt, entry level sort of items, so one night when I was browsing Gumtree (the Craigslist of Aus) someone in my area was having a garage sale and I saw this bad boy in amongst pictures of items he was selling.  I texted him straight away to see how much he wanted for it, he said $40, I said I will take that item off his hands and see him tomorrow at 9.  When I picked it up, it was pretty dirty from storage, few bugs dead inside, but it fired up and the lights came on so I quickly took it home and started on the tidy up.  It cleaned up really well, I then took it to my hifi guy who did a quick service (for $70) and it was running as good as new, the only other outstanding items was the wood case, which was pretty worn.  After much online research I decided to sand it back and shellac the case.  I’m pretty happy with how it came up, but shellac is hard to use, so I only did about 4 coats. Looking back, I think it would have been better oiled than shellac, but I kinda like the DIY vibe of the unit and the impurities.  Lastly, it was missing one of the feet, I managed to find another really crappy Marantz tape deck that didn’t work, so I just took the feet off that. Overall it’s a great receiver, rated at 40 watts per channel it pretty much drives anything you throw at it, it has a warm sound, it sounds really good when spinning rekkids.  Turntable – Technics SLD2 – An incredibly common turntable, so I probably don’t really need to say much here. I bought it from an old lady who had hardly used it for $40, so the dust cover is pretty rough from being in the shed for 20 years, but it runs beautifully and has never let me down, it’s running with a Shure m97xe, again, I don’t need to say anything more on this cart, it’s a great cartridge.  Speakers – Hitachi Lo-D Model HS90F – Rated at 140 watts, these are big speakers, maybe a little big for my receiver, but I don’t tend to push these babies that much, they do love to be cranked though.  They produce a really clear sound, if anything the low ends might be a little soft, but when cranked the bass is very clear and not distorted.  I found these pop up on Gumtree one Thursday afternoon, they were asking $100, again like receivers, good speakers are hard to come by, I picked these up the next day, I couldn’t find much information about these (other than http://audio-database.com/Lo-D-HITACHI/speaker/hs-90f-e.html) from what the previous owner told me, he was given them by a friend in England who used to work for Hitachi in the 1980’s.  I would love to hear from anyone who knows anything more about these speakers, if you own/owned these at some stage, or what they might be worth, love to hear from you. I dig them and they look ridiculously pretty.   There's also a CD player. It plays CD's, I picked up a mini-marantz system, didn't like it, sold it, but kept the CD player :-)"

vintageaudio,3dsb8d,AnnOccupanther,2,Sun Jul 19 02:44:22 2015 UTC,"High percentage alcohol (90%+), static free brush, a handful of q tips and a microfiber. It took about an hour on this one because it was dusty from storage. I don't think cleaning it offers any real performance advantage, but it's part of the process for audio gear I receive. It gives me the time to go over closely and look for broken solder joints or any surprises.   I would definitely get that marantz out if the closet :)"

vintageaudio,3dthft,wenonaks,3,Sun Jul 19 08:16:35 2015 UTC,"I can handle these if you need a shop. You need someone that's experienced with audio gear; the local TV guy may or may not be able to perform the work up to McIntosh standards. Shipping to my place may be quite expensive. PM me if you want to inquire.   Don't spend exorbitant amounts on cords or cables. They make no substantive difference to the sound once you get interconencts that are well shielded and speaker wires thick enough for the current. Put your money into restoring the McIntosh gear and a very good set of large speakers. (I suggest either some monster JBLs, ADS like the L1xxx or Polks like the SDA1. McIntosh speakers are available at exorbitant prices. DIY kits are also a great option.)  The Technics turntable may do the other equipment justice if it's one of their nicer direct drive units. Upgrade the cartridge instead if it is.   The 2205 needs a quick internal inspection and to have it's bias and offset checked. Offset checks on these are done internally due to the output transformers being used. It will have zero measurable offset at the output but if it's unbalanced, I can see that on the scope as uneven waveforms. This should always be correct as there's no adjustment. Deviations suggest input stage drift which will trigger a couple extra more invasive tests and a phone call to give a new estimate. A distortion analysis should be done. If the shop is not equipped to do this, they are ill-equipped for audio work and you should go elsewhere. The meter circuit should be checked for accuracy and adjusted as necessary. The controls should probably be cleaned.   The C-30 likewise needs an internal inspection and a round of Deoxit most likely. A distortion check should be performed.  The tuner needs an internal inspection and an alignment check."
vintageaudio,3dthft,madscientistEE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:37:11 2015 UTC,"My advice to you would be to take it into an audio service shop. Ask them to do an invasive check only. No cleanings, no servicing. Have them give you a detailed list of what needs to be fixed or cleaned, and perhaps shop around to some other audio repair stores and get more estimates. Fixing theses Mcintosh's can bring a heavy burden to your wallet. However, you will be the envy of most vintage setups (including me) and you should feel comfortable knowing that you'll be experiencing some of the richest sound possibly afforded."
