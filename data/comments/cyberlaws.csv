Man arrested after filming fatal crash from inside car   My first impression was that he had filmed the actual crash from inside his own car, via a dash-cam.

Here I was, all ready to get my pitchfork out over police arresting people exercising their rights to film in public, but no. Its just some asshole that has no respect.

The sockets are there to power cleaning equipment while the trains are stopped in depots, and they’re clearly marked “cleaners use only and not for public use”.   It's against the rules because it's against the rules isn't a justification.  The cleaners aren't using them at the time, so that's not really sufficient justification.     If something was directly plugged into it (for example a standard computer, or a laptop without a battery in) the equipment would probably be damaged at any section gaps where the power supply changes from one substation to another   This is a reason to warn people not to use them.

This could be a personal device, but at that size, I doubt it.  My guess would be government or news media.  Either way, they should have knocked it out of the air if they are worried about safety.

cyberlaws,3d50ro,yoloimgay,4,Mon Jul 13 17:05:24 2015 UTC,"No, first amendment. If it's written down.  There's an open question as to whether ""cyber weapons"" are protected by the second amendment, with the likely answer being ""no"" because it's hard to determine what the reasonable non-criminal use would be. Under that rubric, it might be lawful to possess them, but it's much easier to restrict the right to do so (e.g., with licensing, or blanket bans on certain functionality). -- There's also an open question as to what a ""cyber weapon"" is!  That' the best I can do at the moment, but googling around on some law blogs will give a good idea of where the thinking is. I'm sure somebody has written about it.  Oh! Another interesting point is that EO 13694 may make it illegal to do anything to ""support"" certain kinds of criminal/terrorist acts with computers. ""Support"" (or whatever similar word they use) isn't defined, so writing tools could get your assets frozen, but really we don't know.  Most of this presents issues that are completely novel in the law, which is to say that it's going to be years before the law is settled on it.

Why should the online world have different rules than the offline one, it's ridiculous."

cyberlaws,3bvae8,AnonymousTechie,5,Thu Jul 2 13:22:58 2015 UTC,Intending to cause emotional distress will come after.

cyberlaws,3bdy00,SomebodyReasonable,3,Sun Jun 28 08:43:48 2015 UTC,I believe that the timid response to the Snowden leaks surprised the securocrats and they now feel confident to codify into law the same activities they were once hiding in fear for popular retribution.
