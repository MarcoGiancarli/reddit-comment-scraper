'The possession of power changes powerholders—usually in ways invisible to them—by triggering activation of the behavioral approach system, based in the left frontal cortex and fueled by the neurotransmitter dopamine. It’s automatic. Nevertheless, it makes powerful people quick to act on appetites, to detect opportunities for material and social rewards such as food, money, attention, sex, and approval. They think about sex more and flirt more flagrantly. Poorly attuned to others, they pay little attention to others’ feelings and assess their attitudes, interests, and needs inaccurately. Politeness be damned, they act rudely, indulging their own whims. “Having power,” Keltner reports, “makes people more likely to act as sociopaths.”'  https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201312/love-and-power  We are hardwired to behave this way when we have power.

Modern values are a smoke cloud that exploits the workings of the human mind to give full control of the metaphorical ship to power groups who have shaped the world the way they want it, and want it to stay that way.   This is for example demonstrated by the overall arrogance of the Western block towards its values, UK, France, US, and many other have lately been hammering that we must stop those who do not recognize our values.   This is a frightening thing really, because it implies we should not question our values. And also, what are our values? Because it surely is not what they claim it to be, we don't have democracy, we are not free, we are not all equal in the eyes of the law.

conspiracy,3e2tq2,Bovolt,5,Tue Jul 21 17:05:56 2015 UTC,"I'd define anarchy as absence of coercive, unjustified hierarchy. This means things like the state and capitalism.   Within the anarchist spectrum, I'm not entirely sure how I would define myself. I like elements of both anarcho-communism and individualist anarchism.   As far as visions for society, I like Noam Chomsky's vision:    ""...community, or workplace, family, larger society, whatever it may be, should be under direct control of its participants. So that would mean workers' councils in industry, popular democracy in communities, interaction between them, free associations in larger groups, up to organisation of international society.""   I would add that I view decentralization of society as preferable. Decentralization allows groups of people to create rules, customs, and social norms that apply to their specific situation, location, and needs.  People should have control over the places they live, work, etc., and should probably not have control over places and things that they don't participate in.  I also agree with most of the things presented here.    we'd be back to a hunter gatherer state   Some anarchists believe this is what should happen. I'm not entirely convinced.   I've found that this series of videos (not produced by me) is really good at summing up why I believe the things that I do.   If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them."

Some historians expressed doubt that the Führer had shot himself, speculating that accounts of Hitler's death had been embellished to present his suicide in a suitably heroic light. But a fragment of skull, complete with bullet hole, which was taken from the bunker by the Russians and displayed in Moscow in 2000, appeared to settle the argument. Until now.   In the wake of new revelations, the histories of Hitler's death may need to be rewritten – and left open-ended. American researchers claim to have demonstrated that the skull fragment, secretly preserved for decades by Soviet intelligence, belonged to a woman under 40, whose identity is unknown. DNA analyses performed on the bone, now held by the Russian State Archive in Moscow, have been processed at the genetics lab of the University of Connecticut.

I don't support this collection of data on US citizens, but I also know that it's an inevitable product of information gathering in general.  A natural evolution of decades of spying on the Russians and Chinese.    If we don't have a profile of every US citizen, then you can sure as hell bet that the Russians and Chinese are doing it.  The idea is an electronic warfare zero-sum game where each party has enough information to discredit the other's entire government and infrastructure leaders.  For example, Chinese state hackers could release very sensitive personal information on nearly every major US government official or mogul and destroy their reputations overnight.  Allegations of kiddie porn, sexual deviance, tax evasion, etc...  With one massive dump they could send us into chaos.  Likewise, we could do the same to them.  So the US tactic is to spy on it's own citizens so it knows what the Chinese and Russia have so it can prepare counter measures against such an attack.  Such as specifically seeding false information to weeding out corrupt officials quietly before someone else does.    When you stop focusing on the hatred for this spying and look at it from a global military perspective, you begin to understand why it's happening, and that not much can be done to stop it.  So instead of fighting it, you decided to just make sure it stays in check and that the power isn't abusing the common citizen."

That would be unfair to the other silk sellers.   If Congress knew about it, they would have insider info for both their own interests and their constituents.

Because fast-track shouldn't be dependant upon what's in the TPP. the TPP wasn't up for vote, fast track was.  Fast track prevents senators from adding bloat/earmarks to bills. Prevents them from adding their own bribes onto a bill. Pass the bill as it stands or reject it - no, a million dollars to your pet project which has nothing to do with the TPP can't be considered.  I was against fast track originally because I thought TPP was directly related, but it's not.

Then you think something is being done and vote democrat or green and then say ""I made a difference.""  How about we set it up so if someone pollutes another person's property, the people who are impacted get their property rights protected and can sue like the wind?  Imagine the results of the BP oil spill after they dropped oil on the whole shoreline of the gulf of Mexico.  Under a property rights system, BP wouldn't even exist any more, they'd have been sued into oblivion.  Same for a textile company that utterly fucks a whole river.

It's highly suspected that Saudi Arabia has nukes as well. This is the main reason Israel wants to go to war with Iran because they would lose nuclear superiority in the area if Iran could get a nuke. Iran has no chance of producing one because even if they could get enough enriched uranium they wouldn't be able to test a nuclear weapon accept via a proxy such a N. Korea. This entire situation is a complete clusterfuck and I would be happy if the US would keep itself uninvolved however that's unlikely to happen. I know it's convenient to brand one faction evil over another but morality isn't black and white. The way I see it is there are assholes on every side who we allow too much control.

You're making it out like Iran is the harmless victim and Israel is the only aggressor in the situation. That's an extremely misleading narrative. Iran has consistently been one of the biggest, if not the biggest players in Middle Eastern politics. They constantly quarrel with the Saudis and have played a big part in influencing the Syrian civil war in favor of Assad. Israel and Iran do not get long because Israel is allied with the Saudis. It has nothing to do with Palestine, and it has nothing to do with a fear of being bombed (the decision would be political suicide for Israel, especially after the recent nuclear deal).   As for Israel being more powerful, I'm not going to argue that Israel is an immense superpower capable of taking out the entire Middle East. I just don't see how that is something to hold against them. If Iran had the capabilities of developing a comparable army, do you think they wouldn't?

While hezbollah was able to hold their positions for more than 3 weeks and effectively making it impossible for israel to capture parts of Lebanon for extended periods of time.   And now Hezbollah is a terrorist organization that only exists to meddle in the affairs of other countries. It exists as an arm to stretch Iranian influence and combat Israeli objectives.  Look, I am not a supporter of Israel's actions. I think they have a similar complex the America where they think they know what's best for everyone, and it results in some shady shit, primarily in the West Bank. But to act like Iran is this patron saint of the Middle East is madness. They do just as much shit as the Saudis, and they're playing the victim in the exact same manner as Israel.

This is...strange. I did not claim anywhere that the researchers claimed 95% of people have OCD. I specifically said symptoms of OCD, which is an entirely different thing. This is the line I quoted from the researchers: ""The hallmarks of OCD are obsessions and compulsions. The vast majority (over 95% of people) have both.""  As I said, it appears that they are claiming 95 percent of people have symptoms of OCD. Not that 95 percent of people with OCD have these symptoms. I would assume that 100 percent of people with OCD have obsessions and compulsions, since OCD stands for obsessive and compulsive disorder. This is further supported by the study I linked in this thread, in which it is claimed: ""a new study shows that 94 percent of people experience such symptoms in their daily lives. That is, being somewhat OCD is remarkably common."" My interpretation of this is that these researchers were referring to this statistic (from last year, but has probably been updated to ""over 95%"" since then), which is what I originally said.      In short, this thread really highlights how extremely easy it is to twist and manipulate a conversation.

On top of what you pointed out, those ""rituals"" they're talking about aren't someone counting to 10 in order to calm down; they're talking about things like counting all the steps you take. Saying a phrase 3 times in your head every time you cross through a door. Making lists of things constantly in your mind. Counting the amount of letters in the words before you say them. THAT is OCD. And living with that, without treatment, is a god damned nightmare."
