mapleleafs,3duigs,edmontonmatty,2,Sun Jul 19 16:37:08 2015 UTC,For those that dont know:  NHLe Numbers area nice way to compare counting numbers between players in different leagues and how they would transfer into NHL numbers.
mapleleafs,3duigs,PessimisticPanda,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:41:19 2015 UTC,So Dominic Tominato was more successful than Kapanen last year?  This seems silly. How can you translate points from different leagues into NHL numbers?
mapleleafs,3duigs,Xer0day,3,Sun Jul 19 19:28:36 2015 UTC,Not so silly. Tominato is 3 years older. Hes expected to have better production.
mapleleafs,3duigs,ersal,2,Sun Jul 19 19:41:01 2015 UTC,Also; Toninato rips it up every year he's been invited to camp. I wouldn't be surprised if his game translates very well to the pro leagues.
mapleleafs,3dr2yi,Charl3magne,5,Sat Jul 18 17:16:01 2015 UTC,"The player I am most interested in this season is Peter Holland. Ever since we picked him up from ANA, he has shown some real flashes of brilliance. Unfortunately, that's all they've been and he's only hit a career high of 25 points last year in his first full season as a Leaf (62 games). But at 24 years old, he still has room to grow and a ton to learn from Babcock.   With Kessel gone and Bozak having to compete for the Leafs #1C role, I fully expect our centremen to be much more fluid throughout the lineup and Holland to snatch away some of Bozak's minutes, getting some 2C (behind Kadri) and PP minutes. I'm really hoping to see him hit about 40 points (20/20) and continue his development as a solid two-way player. I see him as being a long term option for the Leafs at C. Killing penalties, chipping in offensively, responsible defensively, and able to move throughout the lineup, I think he is going to be one of our best role-players for years to come.  Marner-Kadri-Holland-Gauthier is an offensively talented and defensively responsible group of centremen that could be strong for the Leafs for many years."
mapleleafs,3dr2yi,tormsc,3,Sat Jul 18 17:26:54 2015 UTC,"Why is this constantly being discussed every single day?  We're winning the cup this year, just deal with it."
mapleleafs,3dr2yi,edmontonmatty,2,Sat Jul 18 21:25:29 2015 UTC,"Ok, well I'm excited. We all know this is not going to be a year of great expectations, but I tend to look at things positively and that's what I'm gonna do this season as well.   Babcock is the wild card in all this, if we did not have him I would not be nearly as positive. Having mike with our team will help shape the culture of this team going forward. The effort they put in, day in and day out.   I know that was always talked about a lot during the Carlyle years but I do think it matters. I remember during 24/7, one thing stuck with me with Babcock and it was after a hard loss. He told one of his guys not to hang his head because it was bad body language. And it made me wonder how different a team would be if they all had that mentality from the start.   Leafs never really had a fresh start. When Burke came in he scrapped the old team and traded in other players. Now the leafs are home growing their guys it makes me really excited.  For this year I'm really interested to see how Phaneuf fairs under Babcock more than anyone. He's a good defensemen that gets a bad wrap and it will be fun to see what he will be like with a coach that will know how to use him, and use him with the right partner.  Rielly is another interesting guy, see if he can develop into the guy we all hope he can be. PA Parentue is one I'm hoping has a big year so we can flip him.  Kadri basically has to have a big year if he really wants to get paid.   But all in all, the Marlies might be more interesting and exciting this year. With lepesig brown Nylander Kapanen and Harrington all looking to make an impact, should be a fun team. Add on to that Marner coming off being the second highest in points in the ohl last year, I wanna see him a year older just dominating the ohl next year."
mapleleafs,3dr2yi,MoreHtsThnSadaharuOh,3,Sat Jul 18 23:13:34 2015 UTC,"I'm absolutely excited to see the Babcock factor as well. Seeing the new culture that the Leafs develop is going to be so huge going forward. We saw some hints of it at the prospects camp, this is a team that everyone should be proud to play for.   I also really agree about the Marlies. I'm planning on watching more of their games than the big club, because I'm excited to watch the development of the kids and it's more fun to cheer for wins!"

mapleleafs,3d2j4o,edmontonmatty,2,Mon Jul 13 00:32:32 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if they plan on buying anyone out. Can't see why they would really.

mapleleafs,3c8224,edmontonmatty,3,Sun Jul 5 20:09:34 2015 UTC,probably both. its either one year or 4-5+ and they likely weren't paying him enough for a long term deal given his off year. They could't do 2 years because then he would become a UFA at the end of it.

I give Nylander the edge because of the ability to score exceptional goals and put up exceptional clips against men on a terrible team, and in another pro league in the AHL."
mapleleafs,3c42xz,edmontonmatty,2,Sat Jul 4 16:05:22 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people were disappointed with the Kessel return, including me, but when you break it down, a 1st round pick, good prospect, and young roster player, is pretty much what I expecting, which is kind of what we got (minus the salary retension... argh). We knew the 1st round pick wouldn't be too high since none of the bottom teams were looking for a 27 year old sniper, plus none were on his trade list anyway. The player we should focus on is Kapanen.  I remember last year researching the players and rankings, I was surprised Kapanen fell so far. I thought Pittsburgh got a steal, which is what a lot of people thought. I know he wasn't stellar in the WJC but in all honesty, who cares, it's one tournament. What will really tell us what he can do is this year with the Marlies. The 1st round pick is great and Scott Harrington looks okay, but the key to this trade is Kapanen. He's the one to watch."

They have traveled basically the same path in life. So close that its scary. Kapanen is just Nylander Light.   After having slept on the deal for a couple day, im ok with the deal. I just can't get over retained salary. Im hearing some now try and say ""oh its not that much, its really not going to effect us"" and its not a lot and it wont effect us...until it does.   Until there will be that time where we are going to need 3 mill in space and we have that money tied up in buying out Gleason and retaining salary on kessel. thats when it will fuck us over and im so not happy about having this on our cap for the next 7 years!."

mapleleafs,3bx5ov,whynot_theleafs,3,Thu Jul 2 22:48:18 2015 UTC,"Dubas said Spaling would be returning to center. Also, I think Bailey plays RW and Winnik plays LW.  Nylander was playing LW last year but some people are guessing they may move him to center this year, nothing has been confirmed though. I'm sure Brennan will see NHL time this year as well. You're also missing Carrick. Johnson is playing another year in Sweden this season but he'll be at the prospects camp."
mapleleafs,3bx5ov,ersal,2,Fri Jul 3 16:16:32 2015 UTC,"I got Spaling as 3C if the team moves Bozak. Winnik plays C but I could have sworn he played RW this past year, dont remember Bailey.  Honestly with the marlies I had a harder time, I don't follow them as closely as others (/u/shutupisaac being one that does).   Nylander could go to center but I think things worked well on the left and froese did well at C. Only reason I think they can change it if they think want Nylander as C  in the NHL. But looking at the center depth the marlies have id be suprised."
mapleleafs,3bx5ov,ersal,2,Fri Jul 3 21:31:56 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the 2nd line was Winnik-Kadri-Santorelli. I'm not that certain about Bailey either, he played so little.  Since Hunter pretty much said Marner would be playing center, it's pretty safe to say Nylander will be on his wing."

It would be nice if we could have a Nylander-Marner-Kapanen or Nylander-Marner-Brown line in a few years. Create our own triplets line like they have in Tampa Bay.
mapleleafs,3bx5ov,1337_L34f,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:04:37 2015 UTC,The Marlies/Solar Bears are looking so deep right now that I wouldn't even bother with doing a mock lineup there because I don't know who's gonna stick. They have a lot of C's that it doesn't make sense for Nylander to shift as much as everyone wants him to.
mapleleafs,3bx5ov,1337_L34f,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:33:41 2015 UTC,"I think I would flip Frattin and Kapenan. Kapanenan only has 4 games worth of North American hockey. He needs to be sheltered a bit. Give him PP time instead.  However I think that Frattin will be back in the NHL because our RW depth on the NHL level is awful with Panik and PA Parenteau leading the pack.... This also leaves another bottom six spot for one of Bailey or Hyman, I'm going to guess Hyman.  Pretty sure Zach Hyman is a RW as well. We might actually be forced to move Nylander to centre. If that's the case I have Soshnikov going to the left, because he shoots left already so he might be able to adjust easier than some of the right shots (like Frattin)  so I have  Leipsic/Froese/Frattin (If he's in the NHL shift everyone up one on the RW)  Levio/Nylander/Brown  Johnson/Gauthier/Hyman(or Bailey)  Shoshnikov/Verhaeghe/Kapenan(with PP time)  Bodie being an extra (or some camp stand out)"

mapleleafs,3bu0wi,edmontonmatty,6,Thu Jul 2 03:39:18 2015 UTC,I think everyones just sad. We lost the one guy that gave us hope as leafs fans. Just give us time to recover
mapleleafs,3bu0wi,ZombieTofu,5,Thu Jul 2 08:09:50 2015 UTC,I'm actually okay with the return. I'm just so sick of paying players not to play us.   I also think this will make the offense more spread out and maybe better possession wise.   Still though gonna miss the cookie monster
mapleleafs,3bu0wi,1337_L34f,2,Thu Jul 2 12:17:07 2015 UTC,Yeah. He was great. I'm sad :(

I'd love to ship out Polak and have  Phaneuf/Rielly  Gardiner/Franson (Maybe Babcock gets their magic back)  Marcinin/Hunwick  Robidas  Going forward in the rebuild. I know it's not much of a change, but it would be a faster d-core with better possession numbers and leave our strength (relative to the rest of the Roster with Kessel gone) on the back end.  Either way I'm glad we can leave Percy, Harrington, Granberg, Loov all in the AHL at least another year.  Edit: Also solid post, good round up."

mapleleafs,3brsfn,edmontonmatty,5,Wed Jul 1 22:13:38 2015 UTC,"To play against us really.  Kapanen looks good, but harrington is not exciting me, his numbers are not that good even for the AHL. Spalling is a good add...But i expected more for an elite winger and to not retain salary. Stupid to retain salary.  Kessel must have just been awful behind the scenes."

mapleleafs,3brsfn,edmontonmatty,2,Thu Jul 2 17:53:56 2015 UTC,"Well there are some things about that.  Their first could end up just like this years. 16th overall. Adding kessel does help their scoring but was scoring really their biggest problem? I think it was their lack of depth. I can still see them getting a first round exit.   And the second we give in that deal would be the penguins second or got in the winnik deal in the first place. So it does not matter where our second is, if they make the playoffs they just get their second back."
mapleleafs,3brsfn,Old_Runescape,0,Thu Jul 2 16:24:38 2015 UTC,"Kessel was never going to score more than 60 points with us I don't think.

So what did we see happen? Dubas signed 3 forwards with decent possession numbers.  The strong point of the team is now in Defense because Phaneuf is still here.   We will see a much more structured game going forward because our offense won't revolve around Kessel, and instead should be balanced throughout the lineup."
mapleleafs,3brsfn,edmontonmatty,2,Thu Jul 2 01:19:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think run in gun offense was ever in Babcocks mind.   You are right, it will be interesting to see what babcock does with this good possession team with a decent defense core (more of a mishmash of players)."

mapleleafs,3bld6t,matdwyer,5,Tue Jun 30 04:47:02 2015 UTC,Franson 2014-15 salary was $3.3 mil.    2013-14 = $2 mil 2012-13 = $1.2   Each year the Leafs pulled him along with one year contracts and trouble negotiating.   I see him pushing for an extended contract with around $5mil
mapleleafs,3bld6t,edmontonmatty,5,Tue Jun 30 04:03:01 2015 UTC,Yeah he's getting at least 5x5 but I would bet on 6x6
mapleleafs,3bld6t,Snizzin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:15:32 2015 UTC,There's a zero percent chance he gets a 6x6. They can barely trade Phaneuf on a 7x7 they aren't going to make the same mistake twice.
mapleleafs,3bld6t,edmontonmatty,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:27:55 2015 UTC,"That depends on how much the guys want him. He's a ufa and now, for the first time he's dealt with the leafs he has all the leverage. And let's be honest, it's not like he's not asking for the moon."
mapleleafs,3bld6t,Snizzin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:16:47 2015 UTC,I'm not saying he's not going to ask for it. I'm just saying there's no way the management agrees to those terms.

He's rumoured to want to come back, (just crap I've heard around the innernetz, nothing serious at all.

mapleleafs,3bld6t,ersal,2,Tue Jun 30 16:18:03 2015 UTC,"He'll definitely want over $5m and probably term in the 5+ range. In all honesty, he's worth it, I just don't know if it's right for Toronto at the moment.  If Dion gets moved then that's a different conversation. Polak is also on the last year of his contract so he'll probably get moved at the deadline. Franson could be useful if all this happens but 5 years is a lot."

He isn't in terrible shape; however, he is never at peak condition and as the year goes on you see the wear on him more than others.   Gary Roberts is an incredibly talented health nut that will have him eating right and training daily."
mapleleafs,3bjj1g,c3judge,2,Mon Jun 29 21:45:18 2015 UTC,"That is very good, maybe he wants to work hard to get in real good shape for playing under Babcock. If he is traded, maybe this makes his value go up a bit? And maybe his value will go up next year if he is more in shape too."
mapleleafs,3bjj1g,Old_Runescape,2,Mon Jun 29 23:21:03 2015 UTC,I always thought Phil was a great athlete but there's nothing wrong with pushing yourself further. I'll be interested to see how Roberts can help him.
mapleleafs,3bj4zp,rossrhea,6,Mon Jun 29 17:29:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, we'd have to get CRAZY returns to make retaining salary worth it, and I don't think there's a team that could give us a good enough package in return. Your deal doesn't sound entirely unreasonable. We're almost certainly taking a bad contract in return, no two ways about it."
mapleleafs,3bj4zp,le_canuck,5,Mon Jun 29 17:35:47 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think so  It's one thing to take a 2/3/4 year bad contract back in a deal, but retaining money until 2022.... (you can't retain for a limited number of years, it has to be the full contract)  Having dead money on the cap as we're coming out of a rebuild will be a huge problem - and it's unnecessary, Kessel is not overpaid like Phaneuf is (look at the Corey Perry and Patrick Kane deals as comparison)"
mapleleafs,3bj4zp,MoreHtsThnSadaharuOh,2,Tue Jun 30 02:47:51 2015 UTC,No. Not unless we are getting something unmovable without it. Like Maatta + poulit outta pits
mapleleafs,3bj4zp,edmontonmatty,2,Mon Jun 29 20:01:51 2015 UTC,That would destroy pittsburgh's defense. I'd say try and pick up Matt Murray or Kapanen instead.
mapleleafs,3bj4zp,MacerV,3,Mon Jun 29 20:12:38 2015 UTC,Its starts with Maatta if we are holding 2 mill. we can go from there.

mapleleafs,3bet39,rossrhea,8,Sun Jun 28 15:56:36 2015 UTC,"If no one wants to give us a pick for him then it makes sense to keep him - we do need actual warm bodies to fill out the roster, and his cap hit is irrelevant to us.

mapleleafs,3bet39,Old_Runescape,2,Sun Jun 28 19:50:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not surprised, I didn't think he'd be traded yet. I heard pretty much no talk about him leading up to the draft. The only thing I saw was today that there was a potential deal with Bozak heading to Nashville and us getting Stalberg back, I'm not sure who or what else would be involved.  If Bozak does get traded, we would definitely need to look for another center in the UFA market, our depth at center would be really thin. Maybe take a flyer on the newly bought out Mike Richards for a short term low money deal."
mapleleafs,3bet39,ersal,3,Sun Jun 28 20:28:46 2015 UTC,Which im not against. He would be a good deadline guy for the leafs to trade for. Probably boost the price at the deadline as well.   I have already accepted we are going to be bad next year. Having him on or off this team makes no difference.
mapleleafs,3bet39,edmontonmatty,2,Sun Jun 28 17:27:53 2015 UTC,Really?  People don't want an overpaid third line centre whose stats are so obviously inflated by playing with an allstar winger?  I am shocked.

mapleleafs,3bbui5,greatnessinthemaking,2,Sat Jun 27 20:04:59 2015 UTC,Does anyone know why there is 31 picks in the second round but only 30 in the rest?
mapleleafs,3bbui5,abcSpectacular,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:44:24 2015 UTC,Chicago was given a compensatory pick  (which is what we traded for) because they didn't sign Kevin Hayes from the 2010 draft. This pick was pick #61.
mapleleafs,3bbui5,PessimisticPanda,2,Sun Jun 28 11:00:23 2015 UTC,"Not to nitpick, but I don't think we traded for the compensatory pick as it was the last pick of the round which would have been Chicagos normal pick as they won the cup.   Chicagos other 2nd rounder, which was maybe 10-15 picks earlier was likely the compensatory pick."
mapleleafs,3bbui5,rossrhea,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:21:09 2015 UTC,"List of thoughts after the last two days:  - I'm really interested to see what Babcock can do with Marincin. Also happy EP is loading normally for me again.   - Part of my gut is feeling uneasy about not taking Hanifin or Provorov, since I'd love to have a guy like that to play with MoRiles.    - Continuing that thread, I'm kinda disappointed we missed out on Kylington by one goddamn pick, but Bracco seems to fit the new MO and anyone that destroys the assist record like that has to be worth something.   - Korostelev probably fell for a reason. Not that I'm unhappy wit the pick, but there's probably something happening there that the general populace doesn't know about.  - I have a good feeling about Timashov. 71A is insane. He also seems pretty heavy for a guy that's so short.   Edit: Formatting"
mapleleafs,3bbui5,MatthewJordan,2,Sun Jun 28 15:26:00 2015 UTC,"I would have liked the leafs to try and trade up for Provorov, for all I know they tried and did not succeed. Marner and Provorov would have been a good win for this team."
mapleleafs,3bbui5,rossrhea,2,Sun Jun 28 17:23:10 2015 UTC,"I'm happy with all the picks they made and I trust the scouting and as much as I would've wanted provorov, I know that we'll have high picks next year and there are a few very good defensive prospects for that draft.   I trust that they drafted by their definition of BPA. Overall I'm very happy with the draft :)"
mapleleafs,3bbui5,c3judge,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:04:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was really hoping to get that ARI pick, but in hindsight it sounds like there was no way Maloney would have moved it for anything that didn't involve a player/prospect like Rielly."

mapleleafs,3bbui5,c3judge,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:28:55 2015 UTC,Listening on the radio all I heard was the Leafs trading further and further down in the draft just before they picked.

mapleleafs,3bc4o2,1337_L34f,2,Mon Jun 29 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"One thing i have noticed about this new management is they are looking in unconventional places to find pieces that may be undervalued to build the team.  Like Dubas and hunter outta the OHL. There are plenty of NHL GM's they could have picked from, but they grabbed OHL guys because they are talented and no one else has."
mapleleafs,3bc4o2,1337_L34f,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:04:06 2015 UTC,"unconventional places to find pieces that may be undervalued to build the team.   And I think it's great however, Even Dubas and Hunter haven't really proven anything on the NHL level yet.  I remember when JFJ was the next shiny unconventional piece.   I think it's great, but a possible reason why these guys haven't been able to move out one of our big contracts is that neither of them have enough respect/connections around the league at the moment.  However I think my biggest problem is I don't like the idea of rookie coaches working with young players, like Eakins in Edmonton.  The only proven staff we have at the moment is Babcock. No one else really has any real NHL experience, including Shanahan."
mapleleafs,3bc4o2,1337_L34f,2,Mon Jun 29 20:59:51 2015 UTC,"Your 100% right. Nothing is proven yet.  But what is there to prove at the moment? When most of these got here the damage has been done and we have been in ""oh shit mode""  Not many gm's look like genius in a rebuilding team. I mean tim Murray made sucking into a science and even then it took him awhile to move vanek and miller.  I don't have a problem with them not moving them yet or even if we start the season with them. We have to hold out and get the best deal possible, and if that is not there yet. We wait."

On the forward side of thing you have Kadri, Panik, Holland,   These are guys that aren't too old that will insulate the core we are trying to build. Something that a team like Edmonton has lacked throughout their rebuild.  Imagine if Edmonton kept guys like Cogs instead of offloading them for picks, then you wouldn't have a guy like Leon Draisaitl in the lineup for no reason, or have to acquire another vet like Roy."

If this wasn't ticketed it would be bananas - I ended up working there helping a marketing company last year and got to do all the stuff away from the crowds, but I could totally see how people felt ripped off with the paid tickets last year. Really no reason for the leafs to be milking it they way they did.  Looks like there is also a $85 breakfast package that gives early access, breakfast, and an autographed thing - I'll probably do that. If you're a high roller and want a $500 front row ticket for the state of the union you can do that too, I bet they have meet and greets for that as well.   Honestly the fan fest last year was pretty fun, it wasn't worth paying for your family to go, but the dressing room tour was cool, pics at centre ice, some free swag, etc. I personally won't wait 2 hours for an autograph, but some people are into that - hopefully with the tickets here they are timed (access for 9-11, 11-2, 2-6 sorta thing) and that should help manage the crowds.  All in all it's great that the leafs took the feedback from the fans and are learning how to do this right - another example of why they're one of the best organizations in the league. Was bush league to try to charge for this last year."

His absolute and total awareness of other players' positions on the ice is a testament to his incredible knowledge of the game. Roy possesses the intangibles of maturity and character that can't be taught, as well as the individual skill that turns heads every time he is on the ice. All-in-all, a highly intelligent defenceman that plays high-percentage hockey and is a catalyst for positive plays in all three zones. (Curtis Joe, EP 2014)   When talking to scouts about Jeremy Roy, the name Duncan Keith often shows up in the same sentence; the offensive and defensive traits embodied by the Chicago Blackhawks star defenseman seem to be akin to what the young Roy aspires to. - [EP] - See more at: http://www.eliteprospects.com/player.php?player=151150#sthash.It5UcCS5.dpuf   Oliver Kylington seems to be me like a kaberle type, and might be a guy that is worth a flier on (I'm sure willie knows him).

Oliver Kylington is only average sized, but lets you forget the missing inches with his hockey sense, his strong vision and remarkable skating abilities.

Strome was the perfect fit for them but because of the stupid draft lottery they couldn't get him. If they took Hanifin you would complain he's not a Toronto boy. If they took Provorov you'd complain they took him too high and he's going back to the KHL. Marner was the best player available.

I really really wanted Zboril at 24 but boston did 1 of 3 things right.   wanted the leafs to pick up Harkin, Roy, Merkley, Sprong or Klington at 24...they moved down to 29 and only Merkley off the board...so then they grabbed their own pick at 34 (traded away for beriner) back. Out standing because after 30 Harkin, Roy, Sprong and Klington are still on the board!!! great for us.   These both traded gave us 2 extra picks and we still might get the guy I want!!!!

It's most likely going to cost us Phil to get another top 10 pick though, but I say just fucking do it. I'd move JVR too if he can get us a similar pick. With that friendly contract for a couple more years, the return on him is going to be more than many people think."

With the draft so deep, gm's can think they can still get a good player farther down and most don't wanna go outside the first round.   I suspect teams would be willing to move their top picks, but would require a first in return. We just gotta find that guy. And it must be between Arizona, New Jersey or Carolina to have a chance at Provorov."

mapleleafs,3av8nd,Stiffedup,2,Wed Jun 24 13:18:48 2015 UTC,Shanuber (Pronounced Shanoober)
mapleleafs,3av8nd,Jeffler,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:41:57 2015 UTC,Shanterbas? Duhunahan?
mapleleafs,3av8nd,edmontonmatty,2,Tue Jun 23 20:45:25 2015 UTC,"Leafs would be better suited to go after 5 or 6 unless they have their eyes specifically on Strome, or think that teams are trying up to beat them to Marner. Coyotes are definitely taking Strome if they stay at three."
mapleleafs,3av8nd,MacerV,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:43:47 2015 UTC,Marner at 3 and Provarov at 4.  I reading a lot about how highly the leafs value provarov. on MvsW they had a guy on (forget the name) and he was so high and had great things to say about ivan.  Heres the podcast where they talk about Provarov happens at 8:20
mapleleafs,3av8nd,flykessel,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:42:03 2015 UTC,Shanahan Dubus Hunter Babcck  ...isn't the answer clear? Its obviously Mike Dub Shan Hunt Clock
mapleleafs,3av8nd,Old_Runescape,4,Tue Jun 23 22:00:41 2015 UTC,MIKE DAD BAB CLOCK EH! THUMBS UP LETS GO!
mapleleafs,3auekc,rossrhea,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:20:21 2015 UTC,Any Idea on what Erixon will be getting? With his number of contracts hes gotten so far makes me think it will be above 1 mill.
mapleleafs,3auekc,edmontonmatty,2,Tue Jun 23 16:54:59 2015 UTC,I'm hoping for something in the 1-3 range.
mapleleafs,3auekc,edmontonmatty,3,Tue Jun 23 18:04:15 2015 UTC,"I don't see him making 3 mill. He was a fringe guy, I think 1.5 is where its gonna land."
mapleleafs,3auekc,edmontonmatty,2,Tue Jun 23 18:05:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really hope not. 3 would be kinda crazy."
mapleleafs,3auekc,edmontonmatty,3,Tue Jun 23 18:07:24 2015 UTC,"And if he gets a contract with us, I wanna see him playing with the team consistently. I still don't really know what to make of him."
mapleleafs,3auekc,edmontonmatty,2,Tue Jun 23 18:09:20 2015 UTC,I'd really like to see him get some actual minutes. Babs should find a spot for him though.
mapleleafs,3aq7o3,edmontonmatty,5,Mon Jun 22 16:51:30 2015 UTC,"Why should we care about trading Kessel to Montreal? We aren't going to be competing with them for several years. If they offer the best return, even marginally, I'd gladly ship him to MTL."
mapleleafs,3aq7o3,178239104511126,2,Tue Jun 23 13:10:50 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine him going there at all. They have no salary room, and no great picks to trade us. I see him going to a worse team for better picks."
mapleleafs,3aq7o3,Mveepee,3,Tue Jun 23 13:31:42 2015 UTC,"I am aware that it presents some problems on their end, but if they had the best offer, I would have no problem shipping Kessel to Montreal."
mapleleafs,3aq7o3,178239104511126,2,Tue Jun 23 13:39:27 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry, yeah I totally agree. With Montreal or Boston on the list the rivalry thing will probably be put aside."
mapleleafs,3aq7o3,Mveepee,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:42:41 2015 UTC,I think shipping him to Montreal means we would get a little extra outta them than if we shipped him to somewhere out west.  You can argue we overpaid for him from Boston where if someone else was interested in the west would have had to only offered less.
mapleleafs,3aq7o3,UncleTrapspringer,7,Tue Jun 23 15:45:04 2015 UTC,I know this isn't relevant to the submission but man this whole 2 subreddits thing really sucks. The content and discussion just got split in half
mapleleafs,3aq7o3,jadeesanton,4,Mon Jun 22 21:52:38 2015 UTC,Is there a reason why there are two?
mapleleafs,3aq7o3,UncleTrapspringer,10,Tue Jun 23 00:20:43 2015 UTC,"From what I understand some people got tired of the user base of the main sub and there was kind of a ""screw you guys we will make a more mature subreddit"" and this happened. The intention was to foster discussion but I really think it just divided the users and the content."
mapleleafs,3aq7o3,sh1tbr1cks,5,Tue Jun 23 00:26:49 2015 UTC,I think that's essentially accurate
mapleleafs,3aq7o3,User63,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:10:12 2015 UTC,Saying the users are divided is an over statement.  Only 5 people post.
mapleleafs,3aq7o3,UncleTrapspringer,2,Tue Jun 23 02:29:33 2015 UTC,But it's 5 of the main people who drive discussion on /r/leafs
mapleleafs,3aogvm,MacerV,3,Mon Jun 22 04:59:04 2015 UTC,Calder Cup here we come!
mapleleafs,3aogvm,illuminati_by_nature,2,Mon Jun 22 13:56:38 2015 UTC,"Top centers: Draisatl, Nylander, Froese/Rupert/Verhaghe/Gauthier  Top wingers: Leipsic, Brown, Johnson, Soshnikov, Bailey, Leivo  They'd be dangerous."
mapleleafs,3aogvm,illuminati_by_nature,2,Mon Jun 22 14:05:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, and even the next year(or is it 2 years?) when it's safe to assume a bunch make the jump to the Leafs then the OHL players can join the Marlies and they'd be just as dangerous."
mapleleafs,3aogvm,edmontonmatty,2,Mon Jun 22 14:14:34 2015 UTC,I see some such as Draisatl making the NHL next season at the latest.  But yeah after 2 years several will make their way up and be filled by picks from the next 2 years.
mapleleafs,3aogvm,Probablywontreadthis,2,Mon Jun 22 14:19:21 2015 UTC,"I think we ended with better jr teams than NHL teams if they were to play each other. But hey, that was the goal really. Hello Auston matthews"
mapleleafs,3aogvm,UncleTrapspringer,2,Mon Jun 22 16:23:11 2015 UTC,Just a few things are questionable but it's a mock draft so I hope you four had fun doing it.   I can't wait for the real draft.
mapleleafs,3aogvm,MrHalligan,2,Mon Jun 22 08:45:46 2015 UTC,"I would say it was fun...and hectic. And I wouldn't say we necessarily lost any trade but we didn't really ""win"" any either. Overall pretty fair dealings I'd say. Lots of trading now for future risk. We also still have Kessel to flip."
mapleleafs,3aogvm,MrHalligan,2,Mon Jun 22 11:55:53 2015 UTC,Seems we have high hopes on Dr. Drain but man oh man Winnipeg went out in a blaze of fire.
mapleleafs,3aogvm,edmontonmatty,2,Mon Jun 22 16:35:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at the time of the deal we were close to deals involving other top 10 picks so though we'd get Provarov or Werenski as well so our defense is weak after all of it but we still have Kessel to trade and I imagine we could get back a decent defensive prospect back."
