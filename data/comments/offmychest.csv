offmychest,3e2yu4,notoriousjb87,5,Tue Jul 21 15:53:56 2015 UTC,"Nice, congrats man. And thanks. ive kinda been in the retail ""market"" for like almost 2 years so im kinda happy im going back into it, even though that the only thing i know currently. Either way best of luck to you my friend."
offmychest,3e2yu4,MissMamanda,7,Tue Jul 21 15:57:21 2015 UTC,"Good luck! And p.s., doesn't matter if it is ""just"" retail. Still a job, still gives you an incentive to work hard at what you do now so that you can do what you love in the future. I hope school and the job goes well for you!"
offmychest,3e2yu4,sqqueen,6,Tue Jul 21 16:24:21 2015 UTC,"During your interview, remember, they want to know if you will solve problems for them (ideal) or if you're going to be a problem (no!). I would suggest you ask them what is the biggest problem they have and how they would prefer that the employee handle it."
offmychest,3e2yu4,sqqueen,5,Tue Jul 21 16:53:47 2015 UTC,"Yea, im keeping this in mind. Since the job is a shoe store and my recent previous job was marshalls, kind of a warehouse of clothing departments and house departments. there was always situation where a quick solution is needed.   But common problems with shoe departments is usually security and theft. So a common solution is usually always interact with the customer and let them know that you're always around and keeping an eye on everything or everyone."

offmychest,3e38al,kelltain,2,Tue Jul 21 17:04:05 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I feel a lot of the people who have issues chose to leave it unaddressed for so long, but then they come to reddit and their eyes light up.  At that point, they have a bunch of people that will listen to them.  Then, they'll recognize reddit as a 'safe place' for them.  In my personal opinion, depression and other mental illnesses can be more effectively addressed in a professional setting."

Even though I'm subbed to less populated and specific interest oriented subs, I'm seeing so much garbage all the time. I try to avoid looking at threads that I know will bother me, but that's so tiresome and depressing. The thing that I hate most is the overly cynical attitudes (that often escalate to pure hating) towards things people disagree with or don't understand. This frustrates me so much. I'm going to keep visiting reddit for now, however, because the really great content mostly makes up for all the nasty shit floating around."
offmychest,3e38al,NERD_RAGE_,3,Tue Jul 21 17:44:14 2015 UTC,I couldn't recommend Snapzu enough if you're looking for something new and different. They are like a better reddit with nice people. Check out this recent video review posted by the This Week in Google show.

offmychest,3e2j8w,ToTheMoon28,5,Tue Jul 21 13:38:23 2015 UTC,"Hey. I felt that way at your age. Very much so.  Over 10 years later, and there are only a handful (perhaps 3) people that I can say I've established genuine connections with. None of them were from high school. My high school years were spent being part of a group that I never felt a part of. I was the tag-along. Accepted but never known. This was before cell phones and texting, but I never received calls ""just to talk"" or invitations to hang out. I never went to a high school party. I never had a boyfriend in high school. Weekends and nights I worked hard for school. I always did sports and kept in great shape. But socially? I felt that the world of high school didn't offer much for me and wondered if there was more. I was right.  What I've come to realize is that...I don't like most people. What you're asking for - genuine relationships - are incredibly hard to find. If you find one in high school (even just one), you did a great job. In the meantime, just experience things. Work hard. Learn. Don't give up on yourself."
offmychest,3e2j8w,well-who-cares,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:39:24 2015 UTC,"Dear friend, loneliness is a temporary thing. However, it is something we overcome, and that's what makes us human. Whether it be that you're more different than society or it is other people that you wish to be with, there will always be people/friends to accept and care for you.  In my days of loneliness, I overcame it by meeting people with similar interest. The main reason why groups stay together is because they have have a common interest. Find something that you really enjoy and socialize yourself with people that enjoy the same thing.  I'm assuming you're still in high school since you said that you're going to be sixteen soon, so if your school has clubs, consider joining one or more that has your best interest and have fun with the people in them! There will always be people that will accept and care for you.  Don't forget to look on the bright side, for there is always a better view there. Stay positive friend. Hope my comment helped. :)"
offmychest,3e2j8w,emaNriSuoY,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:56 2015 UTC,"If you can, try to find someone in a similar position. This is totally not a ""you're young"" speech, just my experience, I always felt like I had no real friends through middle school and the first two years of high school because I would bounce from group to group constantly, so on my birthdays I would invite a ton of people, and most every one said yes, and year and year again it would be about the same 4 people who showed up. So what I want you to take from that is look for consistency in people, people who want nothing from you in exchange, invite them to go to the movies or something, initiate some memories. What I found out in college (local community college 100yards from my high school that most people ended up at) is that all of those people that I thought didn't give a shit about me greeted me like we were long lost relatives, always inviting me to things, telling me how they always loved my sense of humor, and how they wish we had known each other better sooner, strangest thing of my life. What I boiled it down to is typical high schooler age lack of awareness for others, this is a phase that some people will grow out of just you wait and see. Last tip I can think of, get involved in an extra curricular (or more) that you are interested it, for me it was Cross Country running, swimming, choir, Future Farmers of America (FFA kids were actually assholes but the animals were awesome) these kinds of activities foster a common interest that makes bonding much easier, there are challenges that the group must overcome and so there is a very strong sense of team. So basically, you do you for now, don't focus on putting yourself out there so much as developing something you can enjoy about yourself, others will see that and become attracted to you, for friendship or otherwise. Not entirely relevant but it turns out my two very best friends are girls that I have known since kindergarten... we didn't even start being friends until the end of high school. Hope I could be at least a little helpful, best wishes <3"
offmychest,3e2j8w,read_and_seek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:36:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe the type of people you're trying to hangout with are assholes? You should definitely keep putting yourself out there but don't wait for the same group of friends to notice you if they haven't already. Fuck them. High school sucks man. It's full of clicky dickheads. Try to make friends with different types of people, there's a lot of nice people out there that maybe you've overlooked or haven't considered. You've probably heard this before but most often you generally don't ever talk to people again after high school anyway. You might run into a few people you recognize once you turn 21 at the bars but after that, people get married and have kids or move away to college and you never see them again. So I wouldn't worry too much about the fuckheads at your high school. What are your hobbies? Join leagues or teams with other like-minded people and be friends with them. You're 16, you only have a few years left and then you won't even remember this part of your life. It gets better after high school, you start meeting new people from all different age groups especially once you join the work-force. Maybe your high school career wasn't legendary but that doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. No body gives a shit about high school once your out. Its like an awkward bad memory everyone tries to forget."
offmychest,3e2j8w,lideea,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:27 2015 UTC,"I was like that not a long time ago... then i asked myself the following:  Do i want friends or Do i need friends?  I believe this to be something like ""manipulation of the crowd"". When everyone has something your mind makes it up in a way that you will WANT to obtain those things to fit in society and in the end you will feel like its your own desire to have that, whereas you actually wouldnt want it. Ask yourself questions like  Do i want to talk to someone? Do i want to hang out with someone? Do i want to have sexual intercourse with someone? Do i have problems to talk about to someone?  Each of them has different solutions than friends. Of course friends can also fit in the solution, but it's not a necessity.   I'm going to be sixteen soon, I feel like this is a period of my life where I'm supposed to be having fun and sharing experiences with other people.   I'm not sure, but to me ""having fun"" and ""sharing experiences with other people"" do not indicate any form of ""friendship"". Society binds ""having fun"" to other people too much. You CAN have fun on your own, you don't necessarily need others for that. To be honest, for the most part you really don't need anyone to have fun, you feel the fun not them. That's a different matter when you can have fun with someone too. And sharing experiences can be done with your family too, or here on reddit. When i want to share something with someone, but i have no one to talk to i go to reddit, or just strike a random girl on facebook that i know and tell her what happened to me. It's just hillarious how surprised they are and where it can lead to:P Well yeah... you see i have my own way of fun, and i don't need anyone for that.  Remember one last thing: When you have fun, it's only you."

We all know what happens to people if The Internet(tm) decides to punish someone. Hello death threats and swattings and non-stop harassment.  Also remember that it can quickly get very uncomfortable for many of the spouses who were cheated on. Imagine everyone at work finding out that your husband has been cheating on you. That's gonna be fun. Or how about your kids, if your classmates or the school bullies find out that one of your parents was on that site?  It seems like a remarkably scummy website (not just because it caters to cheaters, but also because they charge money from their users if you want to delete your profile? Wtf, that's just blackmailing). I wouldn't mind seeing the site be forced to close down. It's a business, and a pretty awful one in many ways.  But even if it's a scummy website, and even if its users are immoral or bad people, I can't support their private details, their credit card numbers and naked photos and names and contact details being publicized on the internet."

offmychest,3e2gss,the_military_issue,5,Tue Jul 21 13:16:35 2015 UTC,"You're not fucked. You just have to make some decisions that aren't 100% how you imagined your life, which is extremely common.   You are 19 and don't have to go back to Korea until you are 25, so you have plenty of time to enroll in language courses and make that happen.   You could also choose put college on hold, go to Singapore and do what you need to do to keep that citizenship, then come back and finish your degree. Personally I think this is the best option. The world does not end if you need to take a leave of absence during college, or if you graduate a few years older than you imagined you would. It might even be a beneficial growing experience for you.   Lastly, getting married is not the only way to get U.S. citizenship, but it sounds like you don't even want to be a citizen of the U.S. You just want to live there for a few years, but eventually return to Singapore. There are school and work related visas which will allow you to stay in the U.S. for a few years and never even apply for permanent residency, and no marriage is involved."
offmychest,3e2gss,symfonies,3,Tue Jul 21 14:04:46 2015 UTC,"Dude, I totally understand where you are coming from, and you are not totally fucked, nor are you alone.    I am also in a similar boat. I am currently a 20 year old Korean citizen living in America. I need to also go do my military service but it is complicated with the fact that our families immigration lawyer fucked up. So long story short, application for visa change got rejected twice, and my family and I have been out of status for quite a few years now in the States.  This Means that  I am stuck in the U.S because once I get out, I can never come back (at least for 10 years).  When this happened to me sophomore year of High school I was angry at the world, that suddenly I have become an ""illegal alien"" and that my future suddenly became super uncertain. I was wondering if I would be able to go to college, or have a future here in the states, and sophomore year and part of Junior Year I literally played League and Starcraft all day. Things are still the way they are, but it kind of worked out to somewhat where I wanted to be. Life can be very uncertain, and you might have to take detours, but don't lose hope.   It is not true that Korea renounces your citizenship after you graduate from college if you don't serve in the military... (where did you hear that from?). It is actually pretty common for people to ""draft dodge"" by not being in Korea.  Also you can  post-pone your military service even after age of 25 for reasons of ""emigration from Korea"" , and ""school"" and other stuff like that I believe. It says that on your passport as well, that you must submit a form for ""foreign travel extension"" 15 days before you are 25 or something like that.   Also once you are over the age of 35 I think they exempt you automatically (but of course you can't enter Korea during that time, but seems like you wouldn't want to anyways).  You will be surprised at how many people face similar issues here too.    If you ever want to talk about this issue feel free to pm me. It really helped me when I talked about my apprehension about my future with my friend who was in a similar situation as me."

Unless you come from lots of money, I think you would benefit from learning Korean, as it'll give you an edge over candidates come job time, and then perhaps you can start thinking about affording SAS for your future kids.  Also, what did that international education give you if not the most prepared outlook on travelling around, trying new things, meeting new friends, being throw in the deep end surrounded by culture, and accepting your immersion?

Or your parents have more wisdom and insight into people and the world because they've been around longer, and their dislike of this boyfriend should actually be a warning to you.  But my mind is crafting narratives that make it like, you're going back to an abusive relationship and your parents know but also realize they're powerless to do anything about it.  Or maybe, on the other hand, you're just one ethnicity dating another ethnicity and your parents are, like, super conservative and a little prejudice. In which case, victory to you!  Or your boyfriend isn't abusive, but he's a complete drain. A drop-out druggie, a black hole into which all your love and effort ia going to be dumped and never returned in kind.  I wish I knew more about the story. 8 years ago mine would have been the same. Her parents didn't like me because I wasn't Christian.

I can't do keto, and losing weight and KEEPING IT OFF is something that you have to make permanent changes for. You can't just do the diet, lose the weight, then go back to doing whatever you want. Find something that you can stick with.   Also, if you're a binger, like me, and it seems you are...Just don't buy the damn oreos. Saying no for the first 3 days is the hardest. It gets easier after that, and then you don't even want them anymore.  If you want help, please message me. I'm not perfect, but I've learned a hell of a lot about all kinds of things regarding diet and nutrition. Some people just need a buddy to do it with. I'm here for you if you need me."

To my dad I never put enough effort, he graduated with honors in a difficult engineering while working on the side to pay both his and his brother's tuition.  It put a heavy strain in the whole family. He took a chance everytime he could to remind me how I'd fail at life unless I took things more seriously, wether it was on private or in public it didn't matter to him, I was goign to be a failure because I liked to enjoy a bit of my free time with videogames instead of dedicating 100% of my life to study and to sleep.  As soon as I graduated I moved to another city rather far away and it changed the dynamic for the best, I still visit often, but when I do its more about doing cool things and enjoying things together rather than the shitty toxic stuff that happened daily before.  These were 7 awful years I'm glad I left behind, I hope it gets better to you aswell, many parents don't realize of what they have until it's missing, soon enough he'll be pestering you to visit more often."

The Baby Boomers were born into superabundance, and they grew up arrogant and woefully ignorant. They, in essence, sold out all of the subsequent generations in a deal with the Devil, and rejected the Greatest Generation's wisdom en masse.. The bill has come due, and as much as they want it to be paid in full by their children (and children's children) they will not get away scott-free.     Every man has his day. Yes, even the hypocritical hippies"
offmychest,3e15av,thediscardpile,7,Tue Jul 21 04:15:35 2015 UTC,"Please also be aware that the baby boomers have sucked royal dick at saving for long term care and other types of insurance, and that 95% of them will go completely broke before they die. Most of them will rely on the govt or their families for income. It's statistics at this point.   Which is scary, but it's reality.   So be better than them, and invest in life insurance and long term care insurance.   DESTROY your tests to get your MBA, get a kick ass job (you will, you know how to work hard) and SAVE.   THAT, friend, is how you will beat them."

You were never meant to be a clone of your brother, you were always intended to be a person in your own right with your own personality.    I am just a fragile little girl, struggling with debilitating mental illness.   IMO, this is much harder than what your brother has achieved. Your brother has to argue points of law with other people. You have to argue points of morality within yourself.    The fact that I was able to finally move out on my own at 23 is an incredible step.

Our society tells women to shut up and take it (for whatever reason - take it because it's a compliment, take it because you can't prove malintent, take it because they don't know what they're doing, take it because it's not going to stop [has there ever been a problem in history that was solved but had previously been thought of as ""It's never going to change""?
