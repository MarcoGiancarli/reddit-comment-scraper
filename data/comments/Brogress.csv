Brogress,3dudpi,Andrewpcc,13,Sun Jul 19 15:53:14 2015 UTC,"Hey yall, the first pic was from last summer. I started lifting in September of 2014 and did a pretty major cut to get down to 172 lbs. The last pic is after about 9 months of lifting at 193 lbs.   1RM lifts are 415 dead, 330 squat, 240 bench.   I cut drastically at 1500 calories for about 2 months and lost 30 pounds quickly, then went to maintenance (post cut picture is the bottom left) then I started to bulk for 5 months and lastly cut for another 2 (right pic). Now I'm eating at maintenance at 3750 calories per day, eating about 300-350g protein.   I train on a PPL split, hitting chest/tri/delts, back/bi, and legs. I always start training on pull and leg days with compound movements: squats and deads, training for strength on deads and strength then hypertrophy on squats.   My upper body lifts are mostly in the 3-5 sets at 8-15 reps for hypertrophy.   Any body critique, bf estimate, ect. would be helpful!"
Brogress,3dudpi,FutureBIEmp,8,Sun Jul 19 15:56:29 2015 UTC,"Seems like you're doing great so far but Jesus, man, you do not need that much protein in your diet."
Brogress,3dudpi,nmandelas_ghost,8,Sun Jul 19 17:18:41 2015 UTC,"I understand that completely. I don't need it, but I really like eating meat, and actually enjoy chicken still. So until that changes or causes some issues I will probably keep it up like that."
Brogress,3dudpi,hyperproliferative,2,Sun Jul 19 17:29:34 2015 UTC,That seems like something you should at least run by a doctor if you have access to one. That seems like a significantly abnormal diet.
Brogress,3dudpi,Kuresov,6,Mon Jul 20 12:53:00 2015 UTC,"PhD in oncology here - Not really abnormal. Your kidneys will filter out ALL the excess protein, and unless you're drinking those stupid fucking protein shakes, you're not in any risk of proteinuria because of the difficulty with which your body digests whole animal muscle (it's like a slow release). Protein shakes are like diabetes for your kidneys. Now, I must say that there is a lot of evidence that calorie restriction in mammals will lead to a longer life span and much slower aging than with a standard diet, but this has never been validated in humans.   My advice is just do what feels good. It's your life."
Brogress,3dudpi,i_poop_splinters,2,Mon Jul 20 15:11:46 2015 UTC,Could you give us some more info on your stance on protein shakes? I'm guessing this info in based on whey?

As far as gear goes, I feel I can still make a lot of progress naturally, so although I have considered it, I have not used it and nor will I in the near future."
Brogress,3dudpi,Skittle-time,-2,Sun Jul 19 17:41:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I meant something a bit more ahem powerful.  Good progress.  IMO, keep that mindset about gear, but that's a personal decision..."

Brogress,3dob8t,Trenks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:37:28 2015 UTC,First 3 months was a horrible routine I was really just messing around training almost every muscle group on the same day 2-3 times a week. Then last 2 months a 2 day split i belive you call it? Wed: Chest + arms Thu: Back + arms Fri: rest day  Sat: Legs Sun: Chest + arms Monday and tuesday rest  Have skipped out on shoulders and legs alot sadly which im working on. Sadly we have a shitty gym aswell so no powerlifting like deadlifts which i would really love to do.  Diet; i live in an asian household so we eat rice + chicken like every other day wasnt hard adding tuna in there and drink 2 whey shakes a day  Also ALOT of pizza lol I know its not good so Ill change it soon  I know its not impressive what im showing but maybe motivate other people i was surprised how much you can change in 5 months

Brogress,3dknlf,phaed,6,Fri Jul 17 05:23:55 2015 UTC,Yep! Haha I was sitting at 98kg before I left for overseas travelling (not natty) so to bounce back fairly quickly as a natty I'm very happy.
Brogress,3dknlf,renewedhope,2,Fri Jul 17 06:45:31 2015 UTC,How many calories you taking in a day? Example diet plan for day?
Brogress,3dknlf,simbazz,3,Fri Jul 17 09:51:20 2015 UTC,"I don't count calories....my food intake is just eating as much good stuff as I can get in my mouth or afford haha.   But I was eating meals with about 150 calories and 20-40g protein (I'm guessing only) about 6-8 times a day.  What I normal do is buy 1kg of mince (beef, pork, Turkey, chicken, whatever I would constantly switch), then throw in 500-1000g of brown rice, a zucchini, two carrots, 250g spinach, 375g of black beans, 375g of refried beans, 300g mushrooms, a large eggplant, 6 diced tomatoes and sometimes cheese. And cook it all up and that would usually last me a day or two. I'd just repeat that meal plan and sometimes switch to a ravioli version where I'd throw all the same veggies in, with 1kg of ravioli and 500g of mince.   I was taking a multivitamin every 3-4 days, minimum of 1.5L of water a day (it's winter here so I don't usually drink much water unless I'm at the gym). A coffee an hour prior to working out, so no pre workout. And no other supplements."
Brogress,3dknlf,simbazz,2,Fri Jul 17 12:53:04 2015 UTC,Nice progress and lifts mate! What's up with your squat? The difference between your Deadlift and Squat is huge.
Brogress,3dknlf,Khandakerex,2,Fri Jul 17 10:53:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks, Yeah haha I think the only reasoning behind the difference in my squat and deadlift is a) I love deadlifts haha one of if not my favourite exercise, and b) I'm mostly leg haha (I'm guessing the top of my hip bone sits 120cm of the ground) so to get ass to the grass squats I've got to travel a long way. For 2 years I busted my ass squatting to little increase in weight haha just one of the joys of being tall I guess?!?! But gotta work with what I've got. A 6 plate (140kg) squat is my end goal by the end of the year"
Brogress,3dknlf,Khandakerex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:40:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess being almost 2m tall does that to your squat. Friend of mine is ""only"" 190cm and his DL is 205kg while his squat is 130kg.  140kg squat should be doable if you're strong enough to DL 220!"

When I got back home in Brisbane, Australia my old company I left before travelling contacted me with a job available down in Melbourne (about 1700km away) so I moved cities. New city, new motivation with previous body-building experience plus my new job means I can smash it in the gym and have a life outside of work.   I'll be starting a cycle once I hit 90kg and plateau for about a month."

Brogress,3dknlf,modernbenoni,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:10:48 2015 UTC,my unsolicited advice:  concentrate on legs.  As a fellow tall person I can sympathize with the struggles of filling those long mfers out.  Make the most of your cycle and hit the body parts that are hardest to bring up.
Brogress,3dknlf,DomUK89,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:42:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, haha thanks! haha my 1st and 2nd cycle I focused hard on them. I did get results.

Brogress,3de42n,glabius,2,Wed Jul 15 16:09:24 2015 UTC,"So basically pull/push/legs - rest pull/push/legs, 6x a week? Did you do more moderate intensity higher volume? What rep ranges? You've  made some crazy gains, I'd be curious to hear more specifics."
Brogress,3de42n,JackOscar,2,Wed Jul 15 18:48:44 2015 UTC,"I do 3 different intensity and rep ranges with all three of the lifts. So a volume day, at 65% of my max 4 sets of 10. Another day at 78% of my max with 4 sets of 6. And a heavy day at 88% of my max 4 sets of triples. And these are rotated in a way that I don't totally burn out my major muscle groups all in the same 3 days."

I deal with a lot of kids with anorexia, is there anything in particular that has been helpful to you during your recovery that didn't come from within? What helped you change your mindset, and is there anything that would've been helpful coming from an adult when you were only starting out?"
Brogress,3de42n,TecN9ne,2,Wed Jul 15 18:44:28 2015 UTC,"It was just trying to find new healthy outlets to focus on instead of controlling my food intake. When I moved from my parents house when I graduated, I became a lot healthier because I had a lot more control over all aspects of my life and my issues with food slowly worked themselves out. It's not much help, but having people around me who really supported me were a great help."

Wish I had gone in with a clearer plan but you live and you learn. Then I started squatting/deadlifting a month or so in. But I've been doing chest/back, shoulders/arms, legs/core since October (6 days a week), but like I said I had to take a few months off. Ive done arnold's blueprint to mass a couple times and saw awesome results, I really recommend that. I still do the same split as in the blueprint and mostly the same exercises but kinda experimenting with set/ranges at the moment. Sorry for rambling, if you want more specifics feel free to ask."

Brogress,3cxshs,ELLEN_POO,6,Sat Jul 11 21:33:50 2015 UTC,"I figured I'd do another brogress post after almost another two years.  My workout is split into 4 different days. Back/Bicepts, Chest/Triceps, Legs, and Shoulders. I never worry about rep ranges. I just push myself hard with whatever I do during the heaviest sets.  Back day: weighted pullups, seal rows, and low rows, and a few sets of bicep curls. I don't deadlift. I want to keep my long term risk of injury as low as I can. Reps/Sets don't matter for me. I do Anywhere from 1-25 reps per set, and anywhere from 2-6 sets for any given excersize. It's always random.   Chest day: Bench press, cable flies, tricep pulldowns, and sometimes close grip bench.  Leg day: Squats, and lunges, and standing or seated calf raises.  Shoulder day: Shoulder press, lateral raise, front delt raises, rear delt cable pulls, shrugs.  In general, the amount of exersizes I do each workout is not many.  Macros: Almost always 50c/25p/25f. Doesn't matter if I'm bulking or cutting  Bulking calories: 2800ish Cutting calories: 2000 + cardio most days  Feel free to ask me any questions. I'll answer them when I get back from the gym.

My weight, if I remember correctly, peaked at 163lbs during the first bulk, about 160lbs the second bulk, and 164lbs during my most recent bulk.

I actually started in December but i have no pics of back then but i remember i weighted 192 by then. Anyway I cut from mid-december to May 31th from 192 to 165. While i was cutting i did my own bro split, it was something like chest/triceps x2 a week, back/biceps x2 a week, shoulder/arms x1 a week.  I started bulking on June 1th and that same day i switched to PHAT (im on week 6 now and loving it, tho these workouts are INTENSE as fuark). 1st day of bulk i weighted 165lbs, atm i weight 170lbs. About my nutrition, I was cutting on 1800-2000 cals/day. Now im bulking on 3500 cals/day (i thought i was going to bulk easily on 3k cals a day but boy i was wrong lol, i went from 165-169 rather easily, but the last 1.5lbs have been hell, in fact in 2 weeks i only gained 0.5lbs, i wanna slow bulk but at least i aim for 0.5lbs/week. So i might raise cals to 3700 cals/day... My lifts are in title. Dont mind my squat... I started squatting in May... Shame on me.

I don’t eat any added sugars or carbs except what’s in fruits, nuts, and vegetables. I listen to what my body needs and only eat when I’m hungry. I can tell when I’m struggling for a banana or avocado. Usually on workout days or the following morning I’ll have a bigger appetite, but I don’t stress about counting calories.

I've noticed that belly fat for me is the last to go--I still have about 2-4 pounds i'd like to work off. When I was 220 pounds, most of my fat was in my stomach and legs. I'm not an expert, but upping the intensity and decreasing the rest time in between sets may help. Also, be sure to drink enough water and get enough sleep. Days following a good leg or ab workout I'll notice my body holds a lot more water and my muscles look a little bloated, don't let that bum you out."

For body weight squats, I'll do as many as I can for 3 sets.   I like to super set, so I'll do pull ups then in between sets i'll work in some leg raises or another ab exercise.

How do you get full on veggies and meat? I feel like you'd have to eat so much meat, which I don't like in excess. Last question, do you think it was the keto or the bodyweight workouts that helped you most? Why did you do bodyweight versus traditional lifting?"
Brogress,3cokqx,scrotalimplosion,4,Thu Jul 9 22:51:08 2015 UTC,"I keep carbs, just in their natural forms. If you think about rice and grains, they are a highly concentrated form of carbs. Imagine before people learned how to farm, they would never pick 100 wheat germs and ground them up, etc because that would be too much effort and not enough calories.   I get incredibly full from vegetables, but the most important thing I believe is to remove added sugars from our diets. When we eat refined sugar our bodies produce insulin which tricks the brain into being more hungry and the body to store fat. Remember the 5 hour energy commercials--""tired of that 3 o'clock feeling"". Well that 3 oclock crash is from insulin levels dropping from the sugar/carbs we eat at lunch. The great thing about natural sugars found in nuts, fruits, vegetables is that the fiber in them regulate insulin levels. I've never had more energy and felt more than when I switched to my current diet.   I did IIFYM for years and I would always be hungry, felt like shit, and could never sustain it, hence the yo-yo dieting. I feel this is entirely sustainable and don't ever feel hungry. In fact, I feel like now I can go a lot longer without eating (and some people prefer fasting on keto).   As far as the body weight exercises, I don't really know. I kind of wanted to see what my body would look like naturally without lifting weights. I like to think of my body as a big weight itself. I'm not really trying to get huge because that would probably require too much maintenance and working an 8-5 job makes it really hard to focus on work and the gym."
Brogress,3cokqx,RuffRhyno,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:53:21 2015 UTC,"Wow man, I totally agree with you. It's so hard to maintain lifting with work. And I feel the same about refined sugars/carbs, but I find it hard not to eat rice or grains, considering they're a part of so many diets. Did you learn all this from somewhere or through Google?"

Tire flips/drags weighted runs(chains on my shoulders) tire slams pull/chin ups dips burpees I would only take Sundays off to rest and I'd work out twice a day.

Started an actual split a year ago, but didn't start getting committed enough to go to the gym every day (minus 1 or 2 rest days) until about 8 months ago.   Always been fat and wanted abs, but never really dedicated myself to a cut, so just stayed the same weight this whole time.  Starting first real cut today and plan on sticking with it. Gonna try and get around 200g of protein and hopefully around 2200cal a day to shed some bf before I start my first bulk.  I've toyed with a couple different splits over the past year and I've really enjoyed the Arnold split and found a lot of progress with it, however I haven't stuck with it this past month, just doing a halfdecent bro split.  Starting back with either the Arnold split or Kai Greene's split today.  I know its not a lot of progress and I respect all of you who DO have amazing progress pictures.  But looking back on before I started lifting and seeing where I am now, despite it not being all that impressive, it inspires me because it is change.

Jawline squared out, nips look to have a tiny bit of gyno (although it might look worse if his nips were not hard), and the acne blemishes on the body (notice the other pictures of his arms look pretty clean and good skin.

Brogress,3c3syd,Letters567,77,Sat Jul 4 22:36:58 2015 UTC,Is this where you tell us you gained 33lbs of muscle in under a year with hard work and a clean healthy diet?
Brogress,3c3syd,majorchamp,6,Sat Jul 4 14:44:39 2015 UTC,Not all of that would be muscle bro.  You gain fat along with muscle. And by the looks of it he is pretty skinny to begin with. So it is not unrealistic for him to gain 15-20 pounds of muscle in 1 year especially if its his first year of training.
Brogress,3c3syd,majorchamp,7,Sat Jul 4 15:28:09 2015 UTC,"I know, was being cheeky with my statement."
Brogress,3c3syd,simplify_simplify,9,Sat Jul 4 15:30:54 2015 UTC,Not enhanced if that's what you're getting at. Should be noted that I've been very active through skateboarding since the age of 12. When i started weight training I tracked macros very precisely and ate junk food when i didn't have much of an appetite.
Brogress,3c3syd,simplify_simplify,6,Sat Jul 4 15:03:03 2015 UTC,"squat, bench, and deadlift numbers?"
Brogress,3c3syd,KezzaPwNz,8,Sat Jul 4 15:10:16 2015 UTC,"I don't have good strength numbers, these are pounds converted from kg's, 209x1 bench, 308x2 squat, 330x1 deadlift (stopped deadlifting a while ago)."
Brogress,3c3syd,alexandros87,3,Sat Jul 4 15:29:17 2015 UTC,May I ask why you stopped deadlifts?
Brogress,3c3syd,Killerpoptart,7,Sat Jul 4 16:11:23 2015 UTC,"To avoid possible injury, I also feel like I can work back much more effectively without it."
Brogress,3c3syd,majorchamp,11,Sat Jul 4 16:33:48 2015 UTC,"To avoid possible injury   I don't want to sound argumentative, but isn't the potential for injury pretty much the same for deadlifts and squats, or any other compound lift?  I can understand if you prefer other lifts - and to each their own - but I'm not sure I understand the reasoning for avoiding deads because of potential injuries."
Brogress,3c3syd,FisherKing22,5,Sat Jul 4 20:20:45 2015 UTC,I never do dead lifts and squats... I feel i still can't do them properly without feeling like i am hurting my lower back/neck respectively.  I've never struggled to find alternatives for those 2 exercises. They aren't the be all and end all of exercise choices.
Brogress,3c3syd,Gymnocalycium,2,Fri Jul 10 13:55:39 2015 UTC,"solid numbers for one year of training, keep it up!"
Brogress,3c3syd,majorchamp,4,Sat Jul 4 16:03:34 2015 UTC,Majorchamp you're not going to believe me but in 2 years of training i went from 135lbs to 180 naturally. Some peoples bodies have been starved out to the point where it's been looking for an excuse to grow. Some of us who were really skinny were meant to be bigger people if we just ate more food...
Brogress,3c3syd,Killerpoptart,13,Sat Jul 4 20:08:12 2015 UTC,"24 months and 11 months aren't the same thing, IMHO."

Brogress,3c3syd,merrickx,2,Sun Jul 5 03:28:16 2015 UTC,"I'll bet its closer to 20 lbs muscle, 5-8 lbs fat and 5-8 lbs water.  Still extremely good progress.  It's a little ridiculous to assume all the weight he gained was muscle.  I doubt he was taking anything, unless his diet was absolute shit.  I think he'd have put on more than 30 lbs if he had been on gear for 11 months."
Brogress,3c3syd,calleon,11,Sat Jul 4 16:03:29 2015 UTC,"There are 160lb individuals who are on gear. Not everyone on gear is 200lbs at 6% bodyfat. That said, I was being cheeky about the all muscle comment, but that is the stupid shit you see floating around when people making dramatic changes.  If this timetable is true and non-geared, congrats that is amazing progress. Naturals can spend 3+ years trying to get those exact same results.    And you can't blame me for my original comment, 95% of bodybuilding, online fitness, supplements, etc. are complete bullshit. It's easier to be pessimistic than optimistic in this stupid industry tbh."
Brogress,3c3syd,merrickx,4,Sat Jul 4 16:16:22 2015 UTC,"My personal experience: year 5 of bodybuilding, just finished my first cycle and I went from 6'2"" 205 to 6'2"" 230 in 15 weeks.  I am pretty sure I'm leaner as well.  Possibly just a good responder, but still.  15 weeks vs 11 months.  OP would be much bigger if he had thrown in a cycle or two unless he wasn't watching his diet well (and I mean like hardly at all).    I know 160 lb individuals who are on gear.  My argument for OP not based on his ending weight, but based on how much lean mass he gained in 11 months.  It would have been a lot more if he was on gear."
Brogress,3c3syd,majorchamp,4,Sat Jul 4 16:27:51 2015 UTC,"I am 10 years older, been lifting for 4 years, have a 450lb deadlift, 230lb bench, and 300+ squat, sitting in mid 170's bodyweight and just NOW look like OP. It's normal to question."
Brogress,3c3syd,SirDawid,-3,Sat Jul 4 16:20:24 2015 UTC,"OP could have had the same results in 3-4 months with gear.  Edit: same results from his pictures.  2nd Edit:  Since you guys don't understand what I'm saying, enjoy a study reiterating what I've said see table 4 and figure 1 for the illustration of my point.  In 10 weeks, steroid users put on 13 lbs of lean mass from running test-e at 600mg/week.  If OP were to have done a cycle and cruised after he'd have gained a lot more than 30 lbs in 11 months.  I'd bet he could have gained closer to 50."
Brogress,3c3syd,Normal_Man,3,Sat Jul 4 16:41:51 2015 UTC,So since when is .5 pounds of muscle a week unnatural? I thought it was fairly average for beginners.
Brogress,3c3syd,freshairr,13,Tue Jul 7 04:49:38 2015 UTC,"33lbs of muscle in one year? Very little fat gain, if any. Who's your dealer?"
Brogress,3c3syd,glabius,-14,Sat Jul 4 15:42:50 2015 UTC,"Why does everyone in these subs always default to this? 11 months is a pretty long time if you don't have a lot of time-consuming obligations.  I looked similar to OP after just 6 months, but had a bit of a skinny-fat build going into it. Same height but different weights. Started at 155, little muscle, mostly fat, shot up to almost 190, then ended up back at 170 or so at the end of the 6 months.  Then again, this was partially due to work obligation, and I had the opportunity to work out every day of the week, and for several hours a day, aaand in some of the best facilities."
Brogress,3c3syd,glabius,25,Sat Jul 4 16:18:01 2015 UTC,"Because some of us aren't as gullible as people would like us to be. I'm not saying the guy isn't natural, I think it's more than likely he's not being honest with the time scale of 11 months. Look at his arms for example, it looks like his arms have grown 3-4 inches in less than a year with hardly any fat gain. He also looks like he's aged more than 11 months too."
Brogress,3c3syd,glabius,-8,Sat Jul 4 16:36:51 2015 UTC,"There's an in between when it comes to gullibility and jumping the gun.  Now, I don't follow fitness stuff, by the book, at any significant capacity, but it seems a lot of people in these subs are extremely critical toward anyone who's able to make some significant changes in under a year.  Maybe it's just me, but I've had my ups and downs, and some very, very stark differences, and every single huge change I've made to my body, every single time (gains wise, not losses) has been within a year, usually a lot less.  Like OP, with that much change in 11 months. From what I've seen in the military, through special programs etc., OP's case doesn't seem particularly special in the sense of probability, capability etc. I'm honestly starting to think that a lot of people in these subs have been acclimated to more ""casual"" routines,   Without any fat gain? I went up to 190 in muscle, fat etc., and despite the fat, still had good definition all around, abdominals included, and came back down to 170, all in the span of 6 months. If OP could put on most of his muscle in the span of 6 or 7 months, it doesn't take a whole lot of time to cut a decent amount of it in the remaining 4 or 5 months. A fuckton of work, certainly, but not an exorbitant amount of time.   Every time I see these things, I wish I had documented one of my own transformations a lot better. I think there'd be very few people on this sub who would even believe me.  I will agree though, his before picture looks like it could be taken well before he started actually working out, but most of the kids in these subs look a lot older after they've put on a couple dozen pounds anyway."
Brogress,3c3syd,lickcunt2,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:05:15 2015 UTC,"The impression we are left with, IMHO, is that this was nothing but a bulk in 11 months.  I mean just to cut through the bullshit, but saying ""bulk for 7 months and cut for 4 months"" as a natural, in your first visit toward lifting weights is extremely unlikely to get those results.  His arms exploded. I am natural, and have similar arms as OP, but I am honest that is has been a 4 year journey. In fact started at 174, and currently at 174, just different looking body.    I feel like this is at least a 2 year before/after"
Brogress,3c3syd,Justcallitanight,5,Sat Jul 4 19:57:32 2015 UTC,This is incredible progress for 11 months. How much did you eat? What are your workouts? Do you have magic powers?

Workout routine changed very often, started with Chest/Tris, Back/Bis, Legs, Shoulders then moved on to Chest/Quads, Back/Hamstrings, Shoulders/Arms repeated only taking a day off when I felt like I needed it. Doing the single body part split at the moment about 5 weeks into a cut. My body seems to recover very quickly and I rarely feel muscle soreness after training."

Brogress,3c3syd,baleia_azul,5,Sat Jul 4 18:23:59 2015 UTC,no homo thats some great progress and take the steroid comments as compliments you did make some serious gains but i dont think its impossible it looks as tho you have a good metabolism and had a clean diet. I think people in this sub forget how the first year of going hard you can make some serious gains. now if you did the same thing again this year id understand the rumblings but i believe this can be achieved by hard work in a year keep it up

Brogress,3c2lk8,calleon,3,Sat Jul 4 07:22:09 2015 UTC,Yeah your right it's not a bad thing to give constructive criticism. Without tracking you really have no idea what you are really consuming.

Brogress,3bxnqa,AncientApple,15,Fri Jul 3 00:50:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks mate! I'll try to be complete about my meals and routine as I can.  Diet: First 3 months where 2500 calories at 35/35/30 Protein,carbs,fats. Last 2 months had to get tricky/creative, dropped down to 2000 calories a day, still 35/35/30 and the last month of this was carb cycling. Mon/Thur= Medium carb days, Tues/Fri/Sat=low carb days, Wednesday=high carb day, and every sunday I had a whole cheat day and ate whatever I wanted.  Routine:Mon/Thurs=Chest/Back, Tues/Friday=Bi's/Tri's/Calves/Forearms, Weds/Sat=Legs/Shoulders, Sunday=either rest if I'm lazy or go for a run outside or something active.  As for cardio, first 3 months= about 3 times a week for 30 mins each time. Last 2 months I bumped it up to 5-7 times a week for 30 mins each time. I'm a runner as well so it would be an average of 20-25 miles a week i would run.  Oh and 1 last point is for the last month and a half I'd say I did all my cardio+workouts (I liked to do them together) fasted.  Hope all this makes sense to everyone lol"

I'm thinking about working out 5x a week instead of 3x a week but I just need to find the right routine. I'll look into yours even if that means modifying it a bit.   One questions about the food.

Simultaneously I was crushing myself as hard as ever at the gym while being super tired and worn out.

I was really skinny (59kg) and at first I was worried that I couldn't see a difference at all after about 9 weeks and wasn't lifting too much more than when I started.   Friend of mine told me not to worry about the numbers and just keep eating shit tons of food. Anyway he's right, it's just hard at the beginning but it takes off like a rocket (until you hit another roof... and another, and another...) Just stick with it."

You carry more fat now but you're not bigger. This is why your lifts went up. You can move more weight if you're heavier than skinny, more mass to push with. Hell, are you going for hypertrophy? Are you on starting strength or 5x5? Those aren't hypertrophy programs, so that could be a problem as well.   Anyway, post this stuff up and you'll get your answers."
Brogress,3bymdz,skarples,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:17:00 2015 UTC,"I'm eating 3000 calories per day (been a little inconsistent with stomach issues, which I'm seeing a doctor about). 140g+ protein.

Brogress,3bymdz,RetardedDolphinShit,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:31:20 2015 UTC,"Can we see the legs? I'm super curious now.  I would consider changing the Thursday and Friday routine. You're neglecting your shoulders. Add shrugs, reverse flyes, lateral raises, face pulls, the almighty overhead press, and some external and internal rotations. Devoting a whole day to shoulders and traps really helped my physique and I'm sure it'd do wonders for you. You could do shoulders on Thursday and maybe condense Friday into a chest and back day, focusing on different back movements like t bar rows, one arm dumbbell rows, pullovers, and interspersing them with incline chest presses, landmine chest presses, and maybe a little pec deck. Back and chest on the same day is weird for some folks, but that's how Arnie did it--and it's served me fine too during some of my 12 week plans.  Good luck!"

Can't bench 80kgsX10 anymore, now 70kgsx6 is my max. Deadlift max is 150kgs, didn't drop much. But with pulling movement I got stronger. Ab workouts too got easier.

Brogress,3bmtu7,xenzor,-5,Tue Jun 30 18:40:49 2015 UTC,Yeah totally unrealistic for someone to gain 1.5 lbs a month right?...
Brogress,3bmtu7,rocketkielbasa,18,Tue Jun 30 18:22:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe with great genetics and doing everything right. But 1.5-2 lbs a month is about the most muscle anyone is realistically going to gain, and then you have to factor in the time it takes to cut after you inevitably gain some fat.  Most places I've read say that no one really gains more than 20 lbs of lean mass their first year, and after that, 10 lbs a year is considered pretty good progress.  Again, not saying I'm sure he's not natty. But yes, I would say it is abnormal."
Brogress,3bmtu7,ayjayred,7,Tue Jun 30 18:26:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. He's well within natural limits (~22.6 FFMI assuming 8% BF), but that is certainly extremely good muscle gain in 2 years. I'm somewhere around 25 lbs of muscle gain in 2 years, with very rough BF% estimates. Unfortunately I'm also a lot fatter than OP, at around 16-18% right now. Then again I started lifting at 27..."
Brogress,3bmtu7,Terminator2a,2,Tue Jun 30 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"lol 8%?  he's 11% at best, probably 12%. Still looks fucking fantastic, but I'm most impressed by his lifts and specifically his bench. Hitting 315 after 2 years of training is damn impressive."

Brogress,3bnu6i,QDOS,2,Wed Jul 1 00:14:30 2015 UTC,"this probably isn't natural, but the angle doesn't show much, however most ladies who compete use Anavar at least. Anavar is used to preserve muscle when dropping weight really low (like a slim lady) without the increase in test like other drugs do. But it does cause voice lowering and clit growth. (a lady in my gym who competes has a really low voice and she definitely uses)"

It's not fun. You're basically a zombie with no emotions. But it helps to remember that prep is something I'm choosing to do; no one is forcing me. It's an opportunity, not an obligation. :)"
Brogress,3bnu6i,unstablebull,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:21:39 2015 UTC,"I kind of disagree with the hormone levels, you can counter with drugs to help keep levels high (men take drugs to maintain hormone levels to prevent gyno for instance). This helps with negative effects like ED and such as a result of cutting.   That said, it's going to affect you some no matter what since body fat levels are so low at that point.   Again, amazing progress."

Lifting history: - Started when I was 14 - Longest lifting break 6-8months (2 times) - Never watched my macros/diet before - Stereotypical bro split while avoiding legdays      Now: - Decided to get back in shape in january - Started starvation cutting, weight fell off but felt awful in gym - Started counting macros and nutrition, felt 2x better - Decided to cut at 1300 calories - Switched to PPLx2 routine, super volume routine, super high # of high effort working sets - Ended cut in beginning of may at 138 then started reverse diet - Currently eating 2400 calories, approaching bulking territory - Legs are lagging due to years of neglect, only started squatting in may      Lifts aren't really impressive, I have super small joints/bones/hips (5.9 in wrists/27 waist/29 hips), so sucks for lifting heavy, but good for bodybuilding"
Brogress,3bgxn7,Muffmuncher,5,Mon Jun 29 03:20:14 2015 UTC,"Dude, you're 149 pounds? :/ I'm 5'9, and 31, so I'm guessing I gotta hit those numbers to look like you, approx. I'm somewhere at 180 pounds now....  Also, what were your meals like at 1300 cals? How many meals did you have, could you share an average day meal plan?"
Brogress,3bgxn7,Muffmuncher,13,Mon Jun 29 09:35:23 2015 UTC,"One thing to learn about bodybuilding is that its not about absolute numbers. While at the IFBB level, absolute weight due to bone structure may not matter as its a tiny % of their total weight due to massive muscles, it has to be accounted for at this level. I have sub 6in wrists/8 inch ankles/29in hips so I have a very small bone structure except decent size shoulder width. This why I look bigger than what I weigh. For a more normal male bone structure, it will probably take 160-165 pounds, and if that structure has wider hip to shoulder ratios, then the taper wont be pronounced and will also look smaller. For my 1300 calorie cut I did Intermittent fasting, was eating super low carb, 150g protein, 40-50g fat, and rest carbs which is basically nothing, like 50-60ish. Alot of greek yogurt, eggs, chicken, protein powders, with hummus/peanut butter for fats and taste. I would try to eat all the carbs eithier before or after workout and rely on refeed weekends to get glycogen storage back up. Relied on caffeine, creatine, and citrulline to keep energy up in the gym."

Brogress,3bgxn7,Amour-De-Soi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:19:59 2015 UTC,1300 calories is pretty low for a guy whose metabolic resting rate would be in the 1500 I'd guess. Glad you didn't keep that up for long because if you started bulking you could potentially put on some bad weight early.
Brogress,3bgxn7,MamaCallsMePrecious,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:54:04 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by this? I'm cutting at 1600 calories (BRM = 1800) for the past 3 months, however, I believe my metabolism has adapted so I'm adding HIIT and upping my calories to compensate. However, are you implying that if he jumped up to 2400 immediately, he'd mostly be putting on fat?   This was a concern of mine, but I haven't found much literature on the subject. I'll be cutting for another month or so before I want to start bulking, but I was hoping to slowly increase my calories by increments of 250 every week until I'm at a surplus of 500."
Brogress,3bgxn7,Amour-De-Soi,2,Mon Jun 29 15:33:09 2015 UTC,I guess what I mean is that at 1300 calories and exercise his body would become so efficient at using every calorie over a long period of time. So if he kept it up then making a 1000 calorie jump would mess up everything his body had adjusted to. He'd be increasing his intake by almost double. The body would take a while to adjust to that additional 1000 calories and early on he'd put on some bad weight which would be counteractive to trying to add muscle mass.

Brogress,3bgxn7,codithejedi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:40:15 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks for the fast response. One question, and this sounds stupid I know, but why do you need a calorie surplus when gaining vs. figuring out a maintenance level? Is it because figuring out maintenance calories with a changing body is too hard to do? Is it because it's always better to have more than not enough calories when lifting? Is it because more calories let's you heal faster?"
Brogress,3bgxn7,codithejedi,2,Mon Jun 29 20:46:19 2015 UTC,"Building muscle requires calories, so the body doesn't want to build muscle unless it has extra calories to burn to use to build the muscle. There's also other benefits like more energy in the gym due to surplus calories so you can train harder and longer, better muscle pumps to stretch muscle fascia (the sheath that surrounds the muscle, theorized to limit muscle growth) and also feed the muscle with more nutrients which allows better healing and recovery etc."

Brogress,3bgxn7,scrotalimplosion,2,Mon Jun 29 21:20:05 2015 UTC,It's not that ridiculous because the OP said that he lifted for half of his life. Much of the muscles were just hidden under the fat. This kind of progress is pretty much impossible for a beginner who never lifted before.
Brogress,3bgxn7,ak22801,2,Mon Jun 29 21:31:46 2015 UTC,"Yup, all natty. Alot of the changes are due to muscle memory since I lifted for a long time before but just got outa shape.

I have a partial torn labrum on my left shoulder so my shoulders often catch and pop if Im not careful and I can do heavy decline or front leaning dip motions.  I like to cut hard and fast, cause who the hell likes cutting. Just keep protein high and remember to refeed. One disadvantage of a high deficit cut is that if it goes on too long your metabolism starts adapting to the deficit so you need to reverse diet once cut is done."

Do you refeed up to your maintenance cals or to your cutting cals only and drop protein to add more carbs?

Mostly Cardio/Abs/Arms   I started cooking my own meals, (Chicken, broccoli, rice, quinoa, protein shakes, healthier cereal and random fruit & vegetables) I have been eating mainly that for the past 8 months.  I cut out alcohol out of my diet as it was racking up with calories and then giving me munchies later in the night. I also decided to enter myself in my first half-marathon and the 3 months leading up to that, it really kept me motivated to stay healthy. I ended up running it in 1:38:49 (7:30 mile pace)  All in all, I made sure to workout almost daily, sometimes hit double days. No matter how many times I slipped up and ate pizza or ice cream, I made sure to get my ass back in the gym the next day and keep going.

I have a sports background, so I definitely did not start from scratch, but I started lifting seriously on my 15th birthday in June two years ago. I slow bulked for the first 18 months and got to my highest weight of around 170. From there I did some short bulk/cut cycles about one month each and slowly leaned out to where I am now.  Album here: http://imgur.com/a/5cmZ2  My workouts have evolved a lot since I started, but it's kept the same basic structure. I run a four day push/legs/pull/core cycle that I repeat indefinitely, so in a perfect world I workout every day, but take rest days as I need them and just pick back up where I left off.  Each workout starts with a heavy compound for 4x3-6 and then I do accessories for the muscles involved in that compound for sets of 8-16.  Push Flat Bench: 4 x 3-6 Incline Bench: 4 x 3-6 Tricep Accessory: 6 x 8-16 Chest Accessory: 6 x 8-16  Leg Squats: 4 x 3-6 Calves: Bpak's 10 x 10+10 [hamstrings: 6 x 8-16 quads: 6 x 8-16] Or [compound movement for my volume 6 x 8-16 ex. Walking lunges or leg press]  Pull Rear delt: 4 x 8-16 Lat (horizontal): 4 x 8-16 Lateral delt: 4 x 8-16 Lat (vertical): 4 x 8-16 Traps: 6 x 8-16 Biceps: 6 x 8-16 Front delt: 4 x 8-16   Core Deadlift: 4 x 3-6 Abs: hella  Honestly, I eat like shit, but I make sure to at least hit my calorie and protein requirements. I just eat a lot of fast food and drink a lot of chocolate milk. I didn't start using myfitnesspal until about 20 months in, and I'm currently in gains purgatory cus I can't decide whether to bulk or cut from here. I've been maintaining my weight at ~161 for a month now but my strength is still going up, so idc. I look good. I never really did cardio until the past few months. I now play soccer or frisbee for a few hours about 3 times a week.

Goals for the next year is to stay around the same weight, lean out, and bring up my total."

Brogress,3b87dj,Batman5991,11,Sat Jun 27 04:30:43 2015 UTC,"Do/did you also ask everyone with better grades than you if they take study drugs like Ritalin? If you can accept that some people are naturally able to learn better why is it so hard to accept that some people are naturally predisposed to building more muscle? Also it's not like he started a complete noob, he had already been lifting 3 years and had pretty solid numbers (especially his bench). He also didn't give his measurements so we don't even know if he's as big as he looks.   Besides, even if he did a few cycles, you can't blame the man for not admitting to it in a post with his face in it. Remember that cell tech is still illegal in most places.   And before you come with the ""unrealistic expectations for those poor beginners"" argument, his progress is over 5 years and his lifting career has already lasted 8. If somewhere down the road a lifter doesn't see what might be possible or not for him, they're doing something wrong. It's not like he's implying beginners can expect results like this.   /rant"
Brogress,3b87dj,eradicati0nx,2,Sat Jun 27 11:27:47 2015 UTC,I readily accept that some people are predisposed to gain more muscle and appear more muscular than others. With that said this level of muscularity obviously isn't natural.  I have nothing against steroid use. What bugs me is when people lie about it. It's misleading and propagates the disinformation that's already rampant in the fitness industry.  The feds aren't gonna come bust down his door because he admitted to running a cycle on reddit.  And if he really didn't want the subject broached he could have refrained from commenting on the subject rather than claiming full natty.
Brogress,3b87dj,nixon007,2,Sat Jun 27 12:15:22 2015 UTC,"With that said this level of muscularity obviously isn't natural.   Until he comes with measurements we won't know for sure. The camera can make everyone look huge.    I have nothing against steroid use. What bugs me is when people lie about it. It's misleading and propagates the disinformation that's already rampant in the fitness industry.   Lol, how did I know? That's basically the ""unrealistic expectations for those poor beginners"" argument, only worded differently so I'll also word my previous comment regarding that differently. If someone doesn't figure out by their 2nd or 3rd year of training what may or may not be naturally possible for them that's on them. There's more than enough honest information out there.    The feds aren't gonna come bust down his door because he admitted to running a cycle on reddit.   Maybe, maybe not. Some people are a bit paranoid about that. If he's not comfortable publicly admitting to using illegal substances, he's not comfortable admitting that.    And if he really didn't want the subject broached he could have refrained from commenting on the subject rather than claiming full natty.   He could've. If he does juice that or beating around the bush would've been the tactful thing to do. So either he's telling the truth or he just didn't know a tactful response."

I'm not going to stop claiming natty because you're pessimistic about the body but this is pretty realistically achievable naturally with time.   As far as diet and routine, I eat fairly clean but I don't really keep track of macros or anything. My routine changes constantly but I'm doing a pretty basic pplppl split. I was doing a 7 day a week bro split but it was time to change it up. I don't have a set workout, as I just do what my body is feeling. Here is my template for my old bro split though.   sunday-Back   3x10ea varying grip weighted pull-ups    4x12-15 seated rows   4x12-15 underhand rows   4x12-15 wide pull downs    4x12-15 lat pullovers   4x12-15 meadow rows  Monday-Chest   4x12-15 db bench press   4x12-15 cable flyes   4x12-15 superset land mine press/champagnes   4x12-15 chest press   4x12-15 seated low flyes  Tuesday-Legs   5 minute hypertrophy squat   2 sets barbell walking lunges   3 sets 10 LRboth leg extensions   3x10 Straight leg deadlift   5x15 Sumo deadlifts  Wednesday-Shoulders   3x12-15 machine press   3x15 Close grip ohp   3x12-15 front raises   8x12-15 lateral raises   5x20 shrugs   Thursday-Back   4x8 deadlifts   4x12-15 meadow rows   4x12-15 underhand rows   4x12-15 wide pull downs    4x12-15 v-bar pull downs    4x12-15 lat pullovers  Friday- Chest   Bench press pyramid    4x12-15 cable flyes   4x10 superset land mine press/champagne   4x12-15 incline flyes   4x12-15 chest press   4x12-15 incline chest press  Saturday- arms  Whatever I feel like.   It's pretty generic, and I didn't really use it verbatim but it's a great workout to get to feeling what your body needs to grow."

Feel free to ask me to post pictures of other muscle groups, e.g. core and legs, because I didn't include them in the photo.  Nutrition:  First few months of lifting, I had no idea what I was doing, especially when it came to dieting. I wasn't eating enough. I started my first real bulk in the previous summer and kept it going until winter, however, I had gained a lot of fat. I was eating 3000 kcal at first and ended at 3500kcal/day in winter.   I went on a cut during spring, starting February, cutting at 2200 kcal, then at 1800 kcal towards the end of spring. I am now on a bulk of 3000 kcal and will continue to keep it there. Diet consists mostly of bananas, oats, chicken, ground turkey, rice, tuna, protein shakes, and spaghetti.   Macro goals:  ~60g Fat  ~180g Protein  ~412 g Carbs  I use myfitnesspal.

Brogress,3b4jpe,theGuatemalanYMCA,5,Fri Jun 26 00:27:55 2015 UTC,Muscle memory. Sounds like he was pretty well build in the past and let it go and muscle memory makes it easier to get back to where he was.

Brogress,3b4jpe,Zuslash,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:42:44 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily muscle memory. It's because when you build muscle you create new muscle cells when your existing cells are maxed out. Once you quit lifting, the cells begin to shed mass. So it is easier to grow existing muscle cells than to create new ones. The same thing works with fat cells which is why fat people who get skinny can gain it back so fast."

You can access it for free here: http://www.buffdudes.net/2015/02/buff-dudes-12-week-home-gym-workout-plan.html  I added a few extra weeks to it, and for the first phase of the plan I substituted the original plans' first week phase (since I hate full body workouts and prefer splits).  This was between the end of February and now. Picture was taken 1 week after I ended my cut, so I'm looking my fullest there. Overall I didn't end up as lean this year as I had planned, but my goal is to gain muscle and I don't really see the point in grinding out any more weeks of cutting when I'm happy with how I look and am ready to start bulking again.  My diet was to stay around 2200 calories (or a little lower if I didn't feel too hungry at the end of the day) during the cut. My macros stayed at roughly 40% protein, 35% carbohydrate, and 25% fat. Foods I typically ate: oats, cottage cheese (so much cottage cheese), chicken breasts in flour tortilla wraps, chocolate rice cakes with PB2 if I needed something sweet. Dinners I usually just ate a moderate portion of whatever my wife was cooking so that it fit my macros."

Brogress,3avmva,nakedjay,2,Wed Jun 24 00:37:26 2015 UTC,"No regular cardio. My average weight training session is around an hour and 15 minutes with very minimal rest, so heart rate is high throughout.

Brogress,3as7p1,jon04,2,Tue Jun 23 03:24:59 2015 UTC,Off season. Eating anything and everything around 5-6k calories daily. My metabolism it's really fast from playing lacrosse my whole life so I have to shovel food in to grow. And for my diet it went like this:  Diet started at 100g fat 185g carb and 330g protein 45 mins walking a day  After 3 weeks diet change 40g fat 125g carbs 330g protein 45 mins walking twice a day  After 1 more week of whats above I started carb cycling 40g fat 125g carbs 330g protein and every fourth day carbs would be 300g daily. 60 mins walking twice a day  Finally 40g fat 275g carbs 330g protein. 45 mins walking once a day.
Brogress,3as7p1,Nutella_Boy,3,Wed Jun 24 10:25:51 2015 UTC,Why so much protein bro?
Brogress,3as7p1,jon04,-3,Fri Jul 3 01:59:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for response, however is it possible to outline the exact foods and quantities you ate? Thanks!"
Brogress,3as7p1,tryhardfreshman,2,Fri Jun 26 16:07:44 2015 UTC,So I'm always curious to hear from people who have made such good transformations-- How has your life changed since 4 years ago? The physical is obvious but would you say your confidence level has changed or mindset at all? Do people treat you differently from before you started bodybuilding? Details like that are always interesting.
Brogress,3as7p1,Jollywog,3,Tue Jun 23 21:26:46 2015 UTC,I guess I'm a lot more confident yeah but before I started lifting I wasn't insecure about my body. It's so weird I use to wear anything and feel normal. Now if a shirt doesn't fit right I don't want to wear it. But when I was so skinny I didn't even care how my body looked. And as for people treating me different yeah definitely. Some of my friends are really happy for me and some of them kinda faded away from jealously. It's really stupid because everyone is capable of doing what I did but instead they just got bitter and jealous toward me because I actually did it. I try to inspire people with bodybuilding because I never knew much about it now it's my dream and passion and what I live for and I want others to find that in their life regardless of what it may be.

Plus for 6'3 you would have a really big head (no offense) but 99% of the time you can spot a manlet by the fact his head looks larger compared to his body than that of a taller person's.  Edit: grammar

Brogress,3an08w,double_ended_cow,3,Mon Jun 22 06:43:53 2015 UTC,Maybe you have body dysmorphia or something. From checking out your pics in your submitted history you look stockier than the OP. You have a thicker and stronger core than OP. Your frame is wider than his as well. He just naturally has smaller hips/waist than you while having equally broad shoulders. He is also carrying around a few % more fat than you as well.

Also you may have much bigger legs than I do, mine are proportionate but not where I would like them to be yet and I feel like that would give me a decent amount of more weight!

Brogress,3an08w,squak_more,0,Fri Jul 3 21:25:48 2015 UTC,Cycle or no? 50 pounds in two years with minimal fat gains is questionable. Even that post the other day where OP admitted to using he'd only gained 36 pounds in 6 years...
Brogress,3an08w,squak_more,3,Sun Jun 21 22:48:20 2015 UTC,"No cycle! I feel like I could have made even more gains if my diet was in check, because I stalled at 170ish for a good amount of time just having a hard time eating enough to gain but I'm still happy with my progress"
Brogress,3an08w,squak_more,10,Mon Jun 22 00:46:38 2015 UTC,"I dont think its questionable. You can realistically gain 26 lbs muscle per yr, and he probably put on maybe 5-10 lbs of fat, so 40-45 lbs of lean muscle is nothing crazy.  Whose this guy who only put on 36 lbs after steroid use? That just sounds dumb. People become pro body builders after ""6 yrs of steroid use"""

I gained like 15 lbs (from 225) doing that. Then starting in March I started eating 2 eggs in the morning, bag of carrots and gallon of water for lunch, and a chicken breast for dinner, around 2000 calories. I lost 15 lbs in like 5 weeks doing that, but after that I got kinda lazy but still made sure I was eating under 2500 calories, and lost the rest doing that. Nothing too strict at all."

Brogress,3a4lwz,jsong_fitness,12,Wed Jun 17 04:41:08 2015 UTC,"Posting here since apparently this is allowed on r/bodybuilding...  Background Information I’ve been working out for 6 years now. Started off doing a mixture of full-body workouts, bro-splits, and body weight exercise in addition to programs like Insanity and P90x. When I started, I was 130 pounds at 5’8”. As you can see in the before pictures, I was a very scrawny kid.   I didn’t really treat training seriously until about 2 years ago. In the last 2 years, I got my diet in check, started tracking calories/macros, and began training harder in the gym and focusing on bodybuilding as a lifestyle. Pic number 4 shows what I looked like prior to getting my shit together (around 176 pounds in this pic).  After that, I cut down for summer last year, then I did another bulk to up around 182 pounds, and now I’m sitting at around 172 pounds currently.  I will be doing my first Men’s Physique show in 12 weeks. If anybody wants to follow along during my contest prep, you can check out my Instagram account: @jsong_fitness  Here are the details. Note that everything listed below is what I currently do.  Workout Most exercises are done 70-80% 1RM, and I stick to between 8-12 reps and 4-5 sets per exercise. Sometimes, I will throw in drop sets, negatives, forced reps, etc., and I will try to vary these techniques up each week. Also, I tend to go heavy on the first exercise each day. For example, for squats, I may do 5 sets of 6-8 reps and focus on strength. Most of the time however, the focus is on hypertrophy and getting a great pump!  Sunday: Legs -Squats -Leg press -Stiff leg deadlifts -Reverse lunges -Leg extensions -Leg curls  Monday: Chest and Calves -Incline bench press -Flat DB bench press -Flat DB flies -Hammer strength press -Machine press -Cable crossover/pec deck -Standing calf raises -Donkey calf raises -Seated calf raises  Tuesday: Back and Abs -Deadlifts -Lat pulldowns -Hammer Strength machine rows -Straight arm lat pulldowns -Bent over barbell rows -Seated rows -Reverse grip lat pulldowns -Hanging leg raises -Flat bench leg raises -Ab crunch machine -Side planks  I will only go heavy on the abdominal crunch machine. For other ab exercises, I’ll focus on controlled movements and aim for at least 12-15 reps  Wednesday: Shoulders -Standing or seated over-head press -DB, barbell, or plate front raises -Seated DB side lateral raises -DB reverse flies -Cable side raises -Cable rear delt flies -Machine shrugs -Reverse pec deck flies  Thursday: Arms and Abs -Alternating DB curls -EZ bar curls -Seated hammer strength curls -Cable curls with rope handle -Skullcrushers -Close grip bench press -Rope pushdowns -Bar pushdowns -Ab crunch machine -Hanging leg raises -Planks with alternating knee tucks -V-ups (crunches with legs in air, reach for toes)  Friday: Repeat routine starting with legs, or rest day and repeat on Saturday  Diet Currently I’m bulking. Contest prep cut will begin in about 1 week. Total calories: ~3500kcal, Carbs: 375g, Protein: 275g, Fat: 100g  Trying to keep it clean during bulking. Lots of brown rice, oatmeal, sweet potato, egg whites, beef, chicken, fish. Calories will obviously begin to decrease as I begin cutting, and I may cycle carbs as well.  Lifting Stats Bench press: 245, Squat: 325, Deadlift: 445  I am very open to critique and constructive criticism. I know I won’t be able to do much in terms of mass in twelve weeks, but I will take that into consideration next off season.  Also, I’ll be happy to answer any questions.  TLDR: Working out for 6 years, trained seriously for the last 2. Weight has fluctuated over the years, but overall progressed from 130 pounds to 172 pounds, and will be doing my first men’s physique show in 12 weeks. Follow along if you’d like on my IG: @jsong_fitness"

Brogress,39q9tp,narzule,6,Sat Jun 13 19:22:03 2015 UTC,"Day 1   Chest + triceps   Day 2   Back + Biceps   Day 3   Legs + shoulders   Day 4   Triceps + Chest   Day 5   Biceps + Back   Day 6   Shoulders + Legs   Day 7   Full body routine, pull ups, dips, Olympic lifts   Few nights a week I would do some cardio and bodyweight training outside (calistenics, plyometrics etc.)  I had this routine for the last 3 months I think, I had a lot of free time, ate enough protein and just didn't wanna stop training, sweating and working. I still work out 7 days a week, sometimes twice a day, just because I like to train."
Brogress,39q9tp,jefffffffff,8,Sat Jun 13 19:30:28 2015 UTC,"I like how you flipped the wording on days 4-6 as if that made a difference (for example chest + triceps for day 1, then triceps + chest for day 4) haha"
Brogress,39q9tp,Sp33d0J03,4,Sun Jun 14 01:24:45 2015 UTC,Well actually on day 1 I would primarily hit chest and wouldn't switch to training triceps until I couldn't train chest anymore. As a result I would still hit triceps but I would be very exhausted and not tire them out completely. And ofcourse with some chest-exercises I'm hitting triceps already.  And then a few days later I would be hitting the first 3 days again but now I would train the other bodyparts first so I wouldn't reglect them!
Brogress,39q9tp,yuurapik,3,Sun Jun 14 05:42:34 2015 UTC,No rest?
Brogress,39q9tp,Riddick_,13,Sat Jun 13 19:52:09 2015 UTC,"Well sometimes I would take day 7 off.

Other than that, If I didn't feel like my body was going to quit on me that day, I would train."

I think a lot of the times we just see before/after and forget how difficult in reality it was for that person.  Quick question, if you could do it over, would you have still aimed for 6 kg between Nov-Mar or would you have done a slower bulk like what you are planning on doing now? Also, did you not find 3 days a week was sufficient?"
Brogress,39r4dg,giulianodev,2,Sun Jun 14 01:23:53 2015 UTC,"I would probably have gone for a slower pace, 3-3.5kg all-in-all. When I look back at my heaviest picture I feel it was kind of insane letting the bulk go that far. I basically went all-in since I had already packed on more weight than I wanted to when I started really going to the gym.  3 days a week is definitely sufficient, but I want to improve even more on my lifts. I don't know if higher frequency is the answer, but I want to try it at least since I love being at the gym!"

Brogress,39li5j,acm162,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:29:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. But yeah, it's probably that I could lift more than 185 at the beginning; I think it was just a mental block, but that's all I felt like I could do when I started.  I just wasn't that comfortable under the bar at first. I feel like it was 1/3 form improvement, 1/3 eating a lot more, and 1/3 hitting the gym 6 days a week (push day 3 of those) consistently every week."
Brogress,39li5j,d5000,9,Fri Jun 12 16:40:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not a naysayer, rather, pointing out my utter disbelief:  I don't know how this was possible in 4.5 months.  35lbs, a 58% increase in your squat, a 67% increase in your bench, over a 65% increase in your deadlift, and over a 61% increase in your OHP?  Either you're a god, on gear (who cares), or you had SIGNIFICANT strength from HS that was mostly lying in wait for some reinvigoration."
Brogress,39li5j,d5000,5,Fri Jun 12 19:33:49 2015 UTC,"I'd like to say it's the first option, but I know it's kind of the third. I'd consider myself pretty strong to begin with; growing up on a farm, I've been around 180# since 8th grade. After all the manual labor jobs I've had I needed to work on form and get used to being under the bar.   I'm still getting stronger pretty consistently but nowhere near as fast as the first 1.5-2 months."

Brogress,39li5j,deckoturf,-2,Sun Jun 14 06:45:56 2015 UTC,His beginner lifts were barely better than untrained. Most of this was noob gains.
Brogress,39li5j,deckoturf,3,Tue Jun 23 03:29:54 2015 UTC,As long as you're making that kind of progress you should keep pushing through the bulk. I'd say a solid 70%+ BB's wish that they had bulked longer and maintained steady progress once they see their physique at full cut. If you're happy with your lifts/size/strength where you're at; Cut it up. Side note: Your arms and Delts have made some serious progress. Nicely done.
Brogress,39li5j,Jonny_RockandFit,3,Fri Jun 12 18:06:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, it's just hard to tell if I'm putting on too much fat when I see myself everyday. My lifts are still going up so maybe I'll just try to slow my bulk rather then move straight to cutting so soon."
Brogress,39li5j,BloodyWraps,3,Fri Jun 12 20:03:35 2015 UTC,"I'm a lot smaller than you (5'9 165 now) but I bulked from 155-195 in like 5 months. I got a fuck ton stronger and lifting was great. Benched like 315 for a few deadlifted 475 etc granted I had been lifting for a few years off adn on. And let me tell you first hand I regret it. It's honestly pretty hard to gain more than 20 lbs of lean mass in a YEAR even with noob gains. You might have, but the rest is probably fat and will make for a long and shitty cut. Your experience might be different from mine but I had to cut a long time and in the end I really only gained 10 lbs of lean mass. I'm just letting you know of my experience in case you wanna dial the bulk back a bit so you won't be miserable during your cut but like I said you might be having a completely different experience than I did."
Brogress,39li5j,emptycalsxycuriosity,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:58:16 2015 UTC,"See that's kinda what I'm worried about. Do I look like I put on even just 20# of lean mass between the two albums? I can't tell because I look at myself every day and even looking at the two albums side by side, I'm hardly an objective observer.  Everything I've read says you can't really put on any more than a pound of lean muscle per week, and that's if you're in like the 90th percentile in terms of genetics, and have your workout and diet dialed in to what works best for you right away. Maybe I'm lucky and that's me but I don't want to rely on such low odds and assumptions.   Thanks for your perspective man."
Brogress,39li5j,jiggle_the_handle,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:17:52 2015 UTC,Yeah man I would definitely slow the bulk down or cut. I mean you've gotten bigger for sure. That's obvious. I can't tell just by looking how much lean mass you've gained though that's too tough since people store fat differently and fat effects them visually  differently as well. For me the long cut was depressing and difficult and i felt very dyel and shitty even at the end. Maybe you did put on that much muscle and put on minimal fat! I can't judge that. Only you will know at the end of all of this. I'd just say be cautious.
Brogress,39li5j,Nutella_Boy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:23:29 2015 UTC,"calculate your bf%. Multiply your total weight by your BF% as a decimal, subtract that number from your total weight: this is your LBM. That will tell you how much muscle/fat you have on you. Then you can adjust your goals accordingly."
Brogress,39li5j,cum_farts_of_a_clown,2,Sat Jun 13 11:27:47 2015 UTC,"I hear that brother. I think you've got the right idea though. You're pretty tall (taller than me at least) so I'd go up to like... 245-250 and then cut from there. Looking good man, keep it up."
Brogress,39li5j,spirit_spine,3,Fri Jun 12 20:15:10 2015 UTC,"From the pictures it is hard to tell that you gained 30+ lbs. Some  zoomed out pictures might give a better perspective.  But seriously beast gains man. Unreal strength increase. Chest yeah could use a little more mass, and there's no back shot but you can see some descent lats from the front. Seriously jealous of those quad gains though man. I don't have access to a leg press or leg extension, and I don't utilize my legs well in the squat, so it's hard to isolate them for hypertrophy.  You look pretty good where you are, if you bulk much more you're just gonna have a longer cut. If you do want to bulk more, I'd highly suggested doing maintenance for a week or 2, get your set point normalized and your hormones in check. I'd also echo the idea of throwing in a few very high protein, low everything else days. Look up Protein Sparing Modified Fast. Like 2g/lb of bodyweight and not much else.  With summer here I'd think you'd want to lean out a bit and then go for another bulk. Nice progress all around though."
Brogress,39li5j,y1NYang69,2,Sat Jun 13 09:51:44 2015 UTC,Ignoring the time frame it seems like it's time for a cut.  You've probably got twenty pounds of fat to lose which would take approximately five months to accomplish.  Assuming you're not going to prep for a show in which case I'd say longer.   It will then be much easier to determine what your need to improve upon
Brogress,39li5j,azulsteel,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if I keep bulking much longer, I think I'm definitely going to slow it down. Maybe maintenance calories until I plateau in strength and then start a not very aggressive cut. I'm not prepping for anything but I'm definitely starting to feel a little fluffy."

Brogress,396iqb,too_shitty,10,Tue Jun 9 18:07:11 2015 UTC,"Here's a pic from before my bulk to give an idea of what I looked like then.  This was this past August.  Bulk pics are from Feb.  After pics are from yesterday.  http://imgur.com/AhnqEcx  Prior to my bulk my weight was around 170 and my lifts were:  Bench - 155x5, Deadlift 255x1, Squat 275x5  I gained a fair bit of strength over this past cut, which really surprised me.  This August will be my 2 year mark lifting.  I started around 150lb (and was 200lb of mostly fat 6 months prior to that... have pics of that too if that's interesting).  I did cut pretty low on Cals.  Was running around 2300 (macros somewhere around 225c/65f/190p or thereabouts)."

Brogress,396iqb,DuckFan83,7,Tue Jun 9 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"Here's the complete timeline:  February of 2013 (around 200lb):  http://imgur.com/mndNrPW  August of 2013 (about 150lb): http://imgur.com/MhQzmTL ... REALLY small haha.  I did this cut with a really dumb really restrictive clean diet.  (This was done purely through cardio and diet.  No lifting because I had a wrist injury... started lifting in late August 2013/September 2013)  Then... the pictures you see above represent August of 2014 (1 year lifting approx), Feb 2015 (about a year and a half of lifting), and Yesterday (close to 20-22ish months lifting... 2 years this August)"
Brogress,396iqb,thidr0,2,Tue Jun 9 19:04:46 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the pics! I was mostly curious cause I pretty much would stick my current self in that same spot where you were when you did that first cut (i started at 210 5'11""), but with more base muscle mass underneath. At 210 is when I started and have cut down to 180 with both lifting/cardio and a clean iifym diet.   I was kinda curious as to your before and after from 200 to 150 looked like to see if I could kinda gauge how far I should cut, and I decided that 150 would be be a little bit too much for me to cut, maybe 160/165 or so :P"
Brogress,396iqb,chefbubba5,2,Tue Jun 9 19:19:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I got pretty low at 150.  I wasn't able to lift at all either (because of an injury), so I had to basically try to achieve my goal of abs purely through diet and cardio.  Not very fun. :P"

Brogress,396iqb,wtfitsvee,2,Sun Jun 21 23:50:58 2015 UTC,"It was pretty brutal.  I didn't really understand nutrition and basic concepts (like that dietary fat doesn't make you fat, carbs don't inherently make you fat, that you don't want to eat in an extreme deficit, other stuff).  It was like 80% protein, 5-10% carbs, 10% fat.  Very stereotypical clean foods.  I'd do IIFYM if I did it again."
Brogress,396iqb,SlimyScrotum,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:26:52 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate on your routine while bulking? Thanks great results
Brogress,396iqb,Iupvoteforknowledge,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:06:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words!  I can certainly do that!  Keep in mind that some of my routine was the way it was because I had a few muscle groups I wanted to pay extra special attention to (namely chest, rear delts, and lats).  My routine also has a number of optional exercises in it.  For example, if my chest already feels sufficiently exhausted, I might not do decline one day or incline one day.  The routine is as follows:  Monday - Power Upper (This is all heavy lifts at a lower rep range... hitting back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, chest)  Tuesday - Power Lower (Again heavy lifts with low reps... all things legs.  Sometimes I incorporated work on my deadlift 1RM here)  Wednesday - Rest  Thursday - Shoulders and back hypertrophy (I go higher on reps and lower on weight)  Friday - Leg hypertrophy (again high rep lower on weight)  Saturday - Arms and chest hypertrophy (higher rep lower weight)  Sunday - Rest  The routine I started with is this one: http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html  Some notable additions were adding deadlift 1RM training on Tuesdays.  I also added face pulls and rear delt flies on both days where I hit my shoulder.  I also swapped out dumbbell bench with barbell (personal preference) and added in 3 sets of incline, decline, and flat cable flies.  I don't do hack squat because I tore my meniscus a few years back and it aggrevates my knee.  While bulking I didn't do any cardio, but I might try that next time around (since near the end I was feeling pretty taxed doing cardiovascular activity).  Does that help?  Happy to provide more info!"

Brogress,396iqb,lgcurry,2,Wed Jun 10 03:08:59 2015 UTC,"Chiming in.  The front shot was unflexed in both before and after.  If anything, the before my abs were flexed because I was embarrassed that I looked fat.  My shoulder vein is more prominent when I'm leaner.  You can say I'm open fist flexing, but I'm not.  I can't really provide much more than that.  Pale to tan, yep that's accurate.  Shorts below flab and above, that's not accurate.  If you look closely, that flab is gone.  It just appears that my shorts are above the flab because the flab isn't there anymore.  Feel free to check out my back pictures and other progress pictures I linked.  It's pretty hard to fake or cheese back width. :)  You're definitely correct that I'm tanner and that definitely helps.  I wasn't going to get rid of my summer tan and make myself intentionally look worse for a progress pic. :)"
Brogress,396iqb,RedSpectral_moon,2,Wed Jun 10 07:05:27 2015 UTC,I have nothing to prove to anyone lol.  If I was flexing you'd see clear veins all the way down both arms.

Over the course of the years I got more interested in working out, and within the last few years I got even more serious with exercise, and fine tuned my diet.   Now I do a combination of high Olympic/Power lifting 3-4 days a week with some high intensity CrossFit workouts a couple days a week to keep my CV system in check. I'll rest anywhere from 1-2 days a week depending how I feel, or take an active recovery day. On AR days I'll go rock climbing, paddle boarding, kayaking, working in the yard or practice on my couch-fridge sprints.   Diet wise is pretty simple. If you made me name it, it would resemble a paleo/primal diet. Plenty of eggs, meats, fruits, veggies and water. I use MyFitnessPal just to kind of have an idea of what my caloric intake is like but I'm not obsessive about counting macros."

Brogress,38zyjl,Olivia93,3,Mon Jun 8 06:21:19 2015 UTC,"What kind of exercise program are you running? Your lats have some significant development, but interestingly enough your erectors are under developed. Are you doing any solid strength training involving back extensions, deadlifts and squats?   Honestly, you have made some progress that is fantastic and keep it up you look good. But, in a year and 2 months time that is much less progress than I would expect especially at those calorie levels that you have posted. In order to not gain that much muscle mass you must be doing a lot of cardio and not enough heavy lifting. My fiancee has been training lifting heavy with me on about a 1800-2000 calorie a day diet and she has absolutely exploded. I definitely think you have some ""noob"" gains left in the tank.  I would throw in some more low-back and trap work into your program or really just more heavy ass deadlifts and squats. I just think your program may be a little unbalanced. Your rear delts have really popped and your lats, but other things are lagging.  How about the wheels? Do you have any brogress pics of them?"
Brogress,38zyjl,psychotheraplst,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:44:22 2015 UTC,"I do quite a lot of squats and deadlifts. I have started doing a stength 5x5 program, before I was doing 6-10 rep ranges. I play football (soccer) around twice a week so that could be why. I have a lot of trouble with consistency to be honest, more with my eating than lifting.   I hope so! Thank you. I don't have any current pictures of the wheels but will be sure to take some. They lag more for me than upper body in my opinion. Will take on your advice!"

Brogress,38x1tu,y1NYang69,2,Thu Jun 11 03:49:09 2015 UTC,There was this thread about using the foam roller to alleviate your posture.  It can also depend on how severe it is. If you're the Hunchback of Notre Dame; I imagine you would look a lot taller. Best to foam roll and exercise good posture. Either by means of working out to strengthen your upper/lower back and standing up straight.
Brogress,38x1tu,Terrance_aka_Magnus,2,Tue Jun 9 01:55:43 2015 UTC,"I'm 6'5"" and shortly after I started working out I got a few comments from people that I see every day saying that they didn't realize I was so tall. Another guy that I work with everyday saw me outside of work recently and said he wasn't sure it was me because he wasn't sure I was so tall. I definitely haven't gotten any taller.  I think it is just an optical illusion. Having a little larger shoulders, lats, and traps while having a smaller belly and waist moves the visual center of a person's body upwards. If this is true, it doesn't take much because I am bare out of DYEL mode myself."

Brogress,38x1tu,djg08,-1,Fri Jun 12 10:59:33 2015 UTC,Lifting improves your posture. With improved posture comes the perception that you are taller.

You should be a lot bigger if you can put up those numbers. If you're interested in getting bigger and want more specific dietary advice, please feel free to ask.  As for your body comp itself, I can tell you aren't working your rear delts very hard or your shoulders would be more round. Keep in mind that the shoulder is really 3 separate muscles and it should be worked as such.   From the front I cannot see your lats at all, which you usually can with someone at your body fat. I can't say for certain, but your back may need to be worked harder too. Make sure you are doing lots of pull-ups (weighted if you can) and bent over BB row in your back routine.  Another thing you are lacking is strong ab definition. I highly recommend doing abs once or twice a week. For me at least, at has really helped with my ab definition. I like decline Russian twist, dragon flags, and hanging leg raises the best. You should be able to find all these on Google.   Lastly, your trapezius muscles are seriously lacking. You need to be doing shrugs to get them to grow. I would google ""bodybuilding trapezius workout"" and click on the first bodybuilding.com link for some advice.

I know a lot of people like to shit on them, but it did wonders for me. Got me bulked up within a few months of getting 4 scoops of that shit a day.

Brogress,383kuz,brogressthrowaway123,3,Mon Jun 1 16:36:34 2015 UTC,"my advice?  increase rep range from 7-12.  12 being the first working set and increasing weight down to the last set managing 7 reps.  love handles are disappearing, give it time.  for the purpose of getting lean, I'd cut out the nuts.  Sure, they are great source of good fats but they are also calorie dense.  If you want abs and obliques to pop you'll need to eat in a calorie deficit and a handful of nuts won't fill you up like a 9 oz chicken breast."
Brogress,383kuz,PinkBootedBandit,3,Mon Jun 1 19:06:10 2015 UTC,"A cheat day per week can be a problem. I generally allow myself a cheat day once every two weeks, and it's not really a cheat ""day"" more of a single cheat meal. If you diet down with a 500 calorie deficit for 6 days you'll gross a -3000 calorie deficit for the week, and it's not at all hard to indulge in a cheat day and obliterate all that progress for the week.   Also, you don't mention counting calories; you need to do this, at least for three months straight so you can get an idea of how consistent you are being with your diet, and will have a clearer idea of what foods and portions work as the backbone for hitting the right calorie and macro totals. It can be a pain, but with MyFitnessPal or FitBit's searchable food databases it's pretty easy.  And finally, have you built progressive overload into your plan? Doing the same routine for months and months allows your body to adapt to those movements, and it locks you into a static amount of intensity in the gym. I like to build out 12-16 week plans where every three weeks I will gradually incorporate more exercises, more reps, and more supersets while trying to maintain the same level of weight lifted. I know you are dividing your time between strength and hypertrophy, so maybe my advice applies more toward those hypertrophy days, but just try to keep in mind that your workouts must be progressively heavier or more intense. If you can't go heavier, then do more exercises with less rest time with the same weights. Good luck!"

Brogress,37sdvk,JackofAllSuedes,6,Sat May 30 00:26:33 2015 UTC,Thats insane progress! You look huge! Do you mind elaborating on your routine some? And do you know your lift numbers?
Brogress,37sdvk,Dqblue,3,Sat May 30 02:55:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks man! I varied number of sets and reps but I'll give you a couple exercises that I love for each body part:   Chest: Bench, DB flies Tris: Reverse-grip pulldowns, skullcrushers Shoulders: Military press, side lateral raises Back: Lat pulldown, seated cable row Bis: Supinated curls, ez bar curls Legs: Squats, leg press, quad extensions   Again, I strongly believe that any exercise where you can really feel the contraction is great (as long as you're not risking injury). I'm not sure what my max lifts are, but I rep a 5x5 on bench for ~175 and squat a 5x5 for ~185. I don't deadlift because I don't want to risk injury (though I might learn it properly and get into it). My lift numbers aren't great but I focus more on form and contraction. It seems to be working so far for my physique!"
Brogress,37sdvk,paperwheelbarrow,1 point,Sat May 30 03:31:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely look tons better! You kind of remind me of my bone structure/insertion type of deal (wide waist, narrow shoulders) so my only suggestion would be to maybe add some more shoulder volume. It helped my physique a ton to add 2-3 extra high rep, low weight shoulder workouts (cable/dumbbell lateral raises x15-20-whichever you don't currently do, upright row) and really focus on the contraction like you mentioned. My shoulders responded to low weight, high reps much better size wise. Then again you are going on a cut so I'm sure that will help your s/w ratio anyways. Keep it up!"
Brogress,37sdvk,spirit_spine,1 point,Sat May 30 08:22:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, shoulders have definitely been a weak point for me for a while now so I've been trying to bring them up. I haven't really tried high-rep work though so maybe my body will respond well to that. Thanks for the advice!"
Brogress,37sdvk,cujothebadger,1 point,Sat May 30 14:11:50 2015 UTC,"squat a 5x5 for ~185   Damn, with wheels like yours I would have thought you could do way more (and you probably can!).  You do any cardio?"
Brogress,37sdvk,Gymnocalycium,1 point,Sat Jun 13 13:45:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks man! I'm blessed with large quads to begin with, but my squat is definitely weaker than it should be. Other than some low intensity cardio for warming up, I did not consistently do any during the bulk"

Brogress,37nc84,Xerdia,2,Fri May 29 03:28:37 2015 UTC,that's kind of how it works when people have more muscle... not really sure why you are asking that
Brogress,37nc84,helplesslurker,2,Fri May 29 01:34:04 2015 UTC,He weighs 10 lbs more and still looks skinny. I'm assuming he's not skinnyfat in which case he would weigh significantly more than OP if he had the same physique. The weight difference is probably due to a larger frame and/or denser bones.
Brogress,37nc84,Xerdia,-2,Fri May 29 06:21:14 2015 UTC,denser bones   Fucking lol
Brogress,37nc84,JPFresh,-1,Fri May 29 12:14:36 2015 UTC,"What's so ""fucking"" funny? Bone density is a very real thing, a healthy diet along with any form of strenuous exercise increases it, and it can add up to 10-15 lbs of weight to your body. Genetics play a key role in determining skeletal structure and size. Frame size charts generally increment at around 10 lbs, making the difference between a small body frame and a large body frame of up to 30 lbs. Combine the two and your making for a difference of anywhere between 20 - 45lbs. That would explain the difference in appearance between two individuals with the same weight and height but completely different levels of muscle mass or bf%."

But there are countless scientific studies showing that the most lean muscle anyone can build naturally in one month is around 2 lbs. And that's if you're still getting noob gains - someone lifting for 2+ years such as yourself can hope for about 1 pound of lean muscle per month.   So if you can honestly say that you gained almost 8x more lean muscle per month than the average, well...congrats, you're a freak of nature"

I'm a natural athlete and I know I'm a genetic freak. I get told that every time I step in the gym because I out work and out lift guys who are way bigger than me. I don't train 5 times a week like your ""average guy"", I lift heavy with 2-3 minutes in between my sets. Squat, bench and dead EVERY workout, while 90% of the guys I see at the gym don't squat or dead, ever. The weight I gained is not all muscle and these pictures are from the first two months I started lifting. I was unhealthy at 160 and malnourished, which is why I gained so much mass early, that plus creatine and water.   Stick to your arm curls, bud, you obviously aren't knowledgeable in this subject."

By ppl twice a week do you mean Push/pull/legs/push/pull/legs/rest or push/pull/legs/rest/repeat?  And are you deadlifting twice a week on pull days?"
Brogress,36pjiy,jonny_deep,1 point,Thu May 21 03:57:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. I played football and had a weights class all through high school and those first pictures were from my senior year.

I just got back from college and work a manual labor job ten hours a day, so deadlifting has been out of the question lately. I was doing them on my second leg day though."

Brogress,36q1ci,DeckJesta,4,Thu May 21 09:41:10 2015 UTC,I obsessed over weight for a while mate and it can really fuck with your mindset and affect your gains. Forget the scales bro hit your goal then afterwards maybe start a lean bulk if you're wanting to add weight and keep it lean.  You've done so well mate don't stop now. I was feeling shitty and unmotivated today but seeing your progress has helped.

Since week 5 to week 6.5 i cheated which set me back for a 1 1/2 week.  I think its cause i was just expecting the gains to come alot quicker with only a year of seriously working out.  Now, do you bros have any guesses on what my bodyfat % may be?"

Cutting down below 10-12% bodyfat is pointless outside of competition and likely detrimental. You're done with the cut, now go eat, move some weights, and do it all over again and you'll like your cut more each time."

Brogress,36kapf,assballsclitdick,1 point,Sun May 24 02:03:51 2015 UTC,"I don't like talking about my lifts because I feel like a bitch. I stopped flat benching because I didn't feel like it was building me mass and it takes a toll on my shoulders, I was flat benching 175 3x5 but I switched to dumbbell flat bench about  a month ago and I've been running 55-65 lb dumbbells for 4x10-12. I  back squat anywhere from a plate and a half to 2 plates depending on the day for 5 sets and 8-12 reps. Very new to front squats but I add 5lbs every workout and I started with just the bar, I'm at 25 lbs and after every session I feel like my abs and lower back really had a solid workout,  I feel like my clavicles arn't used to any pressure at all and because of that they always hurt after a sesh.  my deadlifts are fucking pathetic, I switched to only overhand grip and I do 4-5 sets of 5-7 reps with 2 plates. I've been rowing 55's on each side for 5-6 reps and 5 sets while switching grip width and pull length to maximize the pump in My lats . I plan to start bulking hard in September  so hopefully I can work up to some noteworthy lifts, I haven't worked out in a surplus yet so that's my excuse for being so weak :D.   Edit: I really feel like You need to cheat on the last repsAnd last sets ofRows to really get a good pump in the lats and centre back, I think that a lot of the growth comes from the bar going from your chest back down to the floor so do what you Can within reason to get the bar up there"

Brogress,36b6l8,SexLiesAndExercise,3,Mon May 18 05:49:19 2015 UTC,"Before I started to workout I wasn't eating well at all. I would have only like one meal a day because my appetite was really low or just wouldn't care to eat anything at all. I just ate enough to survive. After I set the goal to become fit I started to have breakfast everyday with full grain bread, cheese and a whole lot of salad. I also ate alot of canned tuna, salmon and rice. I barely ate sweets or  drunk any soda at all, which kind of explains why I got leaner in my first body weight transformation. After I started to hit the gym I just ate everything and didn't count any calories at all. I was eating burgers and pizza at least 3 times a week, cause I worked part time at a pizzeria, besides that I always drank 1 scoop of whey with water in the morning and 1 scoop of whey with 500g whole milk after my workout. Before May I was actually at 82kg(180lbs). I started to cut at the beginning of May. I am just eating rice, chicken breast or fish at the moment to get shredded for the summer."

My friend said that  I was lucky and that it was due to my ""good genetics"", and the gym worker answered him that he thinks it is more because of my dedication that he saw me nearly every day at the gym working out really hard.

Brogress,36b6l8,PinkBootedBandit,2,Mon May 18 08:57:30 2015 UTC,Well 177cm is 5.8 feet which is confusingly what google shows first. I guess that's it

Brogress,35yh4r,juniorv376,1 point,Thu May 14 18:20:06 2015 UTC,I doubt it was 14 pounds of fat. A large portion of that is likely water weight that he shredded doing hiit - people that start programs like hiit or diets like keto that get rid of water weight will see a quick 10lbs drop and then 1-2lbs a week or so after that.   Not to discredit OP or anything. His brogress is legit.
Brogress,35yh4r,keesh,2,Thu May 14 23:13:54 2015 UTC,"I think your post does the opposite of discredit. It shows that just because he lost a lot In short time, that it doesn't mean he lost too much."

I've been eating the same stuff pretty much everyday but damn it tastes soo good!.. enough grilled chicken breast to feed a family of 4 with loads of different veg..rice.. chicken wraps.. bro food basically   I train everyday at home.. I've been to a gym once in my life and hated it. I have a bench, barbells, dumbbells and a pullup bar   I just train chest shoulders and back  e.g monday chest bench press, weighted dips, weighted diamond pushups, chest flys, and I finish it off with 100 reps of DB press  Tuesday: shoulders: military press, side raise, upright row, 100 reps of DB shoulder press to finish off  Wednesday: 6 sets of weighted pullups mixing up the type of grip (wide/normal/close) followed by 6 sets of unweighted pullups and to finish it off 10 sets of chin ups  and repeat that all week, no rest days  For cardio I do about 25 minutes of HIIT type boxing most days (hit the bag for as hard/fast as I can for 30 seconds then pace up and down for a minute x15)  I do 10 sets of the best kind of  dragon flags I can do every night before bed, I like to read before bed to help me sleep so I'll read a page of a book, do a set of dragon flags, read another page, another set x10 I have trouble sleeping and doing this helps a lot   again I doubt people will agree with this but it's what I've been doing and I feel great all day"

Brogress,35yh4r,Reddittingallday,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:33:44 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with fasting as long as you are getting your daily nutritional needs. It might be beneficial to take a multivitamin with the water-soluble vitamins at the other end of the day that you eat, but probably isn't necessary (I've been eating once a day for years now).  Your current routine sounds great for developing above average fitness and maintaining it. Keep with it, and feel free to change it up. But don't be afraid to pursue other goals by hitting the gym. You'll learn to like it and it introduces some possibility of meeting other cool people with similar goals."

There are probably very few 17 year olds your age that have made as much progress naturally.  Edit: If you were looking for pointers, you could probably hit your biceps harder which is not the normal advice for someone into bodybuilding, but your triceps and chest look massive in comparison to your bis. Also, lets get a picture of the back and the wheels. Your lats look huge already from the front."

Brogress,35i500,TheJtecStudios,3,Sun May 10 16:36:47 2015 UTC,Use  a TDEE calculator. Find your maintenance calories and add 300-500. Keep your protein about the same but increase carbs and fats accordingly. If your still on a deficit make sure your reverse diet. Don't just jump from 2000 to 2800 or whatever. Go slowly as you want to keep any fat gain to the minimum. Obviously you will gain some body fat but it comes with the territory.
Brogress,35i500,you-asshat,2,Sun May 10 20:44:49 2015 UTC,Good job man. The hard part now is not mistaking a bulk for an open diet.

Brogress,35i500,AcornBiter,7,Mon May 11 18:59:36 2015 UTC,So much broscience.
Brogress,35i500,you-asshat,3,Sun May 10 17:23:23 2015 UTC,No kidding. Most studies point to 0.5-1.0 grams of protein per pound of  LEAN body mass. Eventually your body will just use excess protein as fuel like anything else. If you want to gain weight keep your protein the same and up your carbs/fats. I find that bulk or cut I stay at the same level of protein but just alter my carbs and fats.
Brogress,35i500,filthy_casul,1 point,Sun May 10 19:55:44 2015 UTC,"Really? I crank my protein down when I bulk and raise my carbs, fats usually stay around the same for me. I tried 0.7 grams per pound when I was bulking and it worked pretty damn good for me, and I imagine you could go even lower than that. Now that I'm on a cut, it's around 1 gram per pound just because I'm a light dude and I had a hard time not exceeding my protein while bulking."
Brogress,35i500,you-asshat,2,Sun May 10 20:40:31 2015 UTC,I said per pound of lean mass. So if your 180 with 15% BF then roughly 155-160 grams of protein is plenty.  But I agree protein is more important on a cut. Its just a rough estimate but you definitely don't need to increase your protein while bulking is what I was trying to point out.
Brogress,35i500,Braggle,1 point,Mon May 11 16:32:22 2015 UTC,Really? I've always heard I need 1g per pound and then some. So what the first guy said sounded right to me.

Brogress,35eraj,swinghound1,2,Sat May 9 17:15:06 2015 UTC,"Petty textbook cut, nice job. Can you elaborate more on your routine and why you felt it necessary to do daily push-ups and pull-ups ?"
Brogress,35eraj,losingprogress,1 point,Sun May 10 15:04:09 2015 UTC,"I have always had trouble with growing my chest, which I'm pretty sure was due to my back being pretty weak.  Wide grip pull ups were always a struggle (usually could only barely squeak out 5 sets of 5 reps).  I decided to do a 5x5 every morning until they became easy and then started adding a single rep each day after.  I'm now up to 5 sets of 11 reps and starting to do 12's. Hopefully my next bulk won't limit my upper chest size from my back strength.  Pullups I kept doing a 4x20, but changed them to slowly be diamond pushups, then one arm against a wall, now I'm trying to slowly get to one-arm pushups on the floor."
Brogress,35eraj,losingprogress,1 point,Wed May 13 11:52:05 2015 UTC,"That's awesome that your reps went up, but do you feel it added significant mass to your back? I also have a small back and am thinking of doing this, even though I hit 50 pull-ups every Monday during chest+back."
Brogress,35eraj,Righteousparkour,1 point,Wed May 13 16:30:55 2015 UTC,How did you find your back felt when you got to back day after all the pull ups?
Brogress,35eraj,greneroom,2,Sat May 9 18:22:30 2015 UTC,"Because it was really gradual, it didn't seem that hard most days.  However not enough sleep or other factors sometimes meant I skipped it if I didn't have enough energy in the morning.  I did the pull ups in the morning before work, and then my actual workout in the late afternoon, so I was slightly weaker but still good enough to complete it."

Brogress,357mk8,Warya,6,Fri May 8 03:28:32 2015 UTC,"Dude, you're looking sick. As a fellow tall-bro (6'2""), have a quick question. I'm running PPLx2 with rest right now as well.. are your days different (first PPL and second PPL each week)? I have flipped between doing 8-12 the whole time or doing my first PPL (M-W) as heavy weights, lower reps and second PPL (TH-S) as lighter weight, higher reps.  Any insight you can give on your weights in regards to your routine would be helpful (I can't see the fitocracy link for some reason)!"
Brogress,357mk8,TheUnfaithful,1 point,Thu May 7 20:45:31 2015 UTC,"My PPL is pull push legs, pull push legs, rest, repeat. A lot of people do push first, so I just wanted to specify that.    I go heavy every time. I've been thinking of changing one day to higher reps like you do, but I'm still making steady progress so far. Currently every workout my main compound lifts aim for 5 reps (3-5 reps towards end) of 3 sets, and 8-12 reps on accessory movements.    Also, thanks for the compliments!    EDIT: I adjust accordingly to how I feel each day as well, some days I'll lower the weights 5-10 lbs if I feel shitty."
Brogress,357mk8,NerdMachine,2,Thu May 7 20:50:23 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, so main compound for 3x5, then 8-12x3 for accessories, sounds good!

Breakfast and dinner i can go perfect with calories but at school the temptation is absolutely killer. Any good pop substitutes?"
Brogress,34w6cb,DuckFan83,1 point,Tue May 5 14:22:40 2015 UTC,Diet soda?
Brogress,34w6cb,Donedunit,1 point,Tue May 5 14:39:16 2015 UTC,"I feel you on that one!  Except as a 31 year old, it is beer, not soda."
Brogress,34w6cb,abutor_,1 point,Tue May 5 15:22:28 2015 UTC,Flavoured sparkling waters using Sucralose is what helps me - no calories and really tastes like normal soda!  Let me know if you need any diet help!

Brogress,346uxe,whendoesOpTicplay,2,Wed Apr 29 04:38:16 2015 UTC,"I know this is 2 weeks old but i'm going to reply anyways.  Never, ever have that attitude. It never works. You are not getting swole for next semester over the summer, you are adding a few hours of working out every week to your life. You'll see what I mean when you are 1 month into, though having that attitude usually doesn't last you a month."
Brogress,346uxe,clumpnut,1 point,Wed May 13 03:47:23 2015 UTC,"I know it won't be that significant, but its a start for next school year. I want to develop a habit so I will keep up with it during next semester."
Brogress,346uxe,whendoesOpTicplay,2,Wed May 13 04:16:39 2015 UTC,That's great progress for just 2 months! Have you gained much strength/progressed much with your workouts?
Brogress,346uxe,stickyelbows,2,Tue Apr 28 20:56:07 2015 UTC,"I have this body weight workout routine i have built combining stuff from the most famous body weight workout programs. The first times i did the workout it took me 40 minutes to complete. Today when i finished it, i completed it in 24 minutes. I was really weak when i started. Record time is 23 minutes."
Brogress,346uxe,QDOS,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:02:41 2015 UTC,Make sure to continue to progressively overload aka make your workout harder or longer to increase time under tension and volume
Brogress,346uxe,Wazqaz,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:40:10 2015 UTC,I've already increased reps and i spend more time perfecting the move than just trying to pull trough the workout as fast as i can.
Brogress,346uxe,BlakeBrai,0,Tue Apr 28 21:58:37 2015 UTC,"You should aim for a workout at least 30 to 45 minutes long. Although it can be a good indicator, going fast is not always the best. Rather do 10 controlled reps of 2 seconds each (for example) than 10 fast reps that seem too choppy/butchered. At some point, some body weight exercises can be done with added weights (example dips with a plate attached to a chain to your waist) as to make sure you work out the strength as much as endurance. Good job nonetheless!"
Brogress,346uxe,BlakeBrai,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:51:55 2015 UTC,"Thats only my body weight workout. I spend another 25 minutes on the kettlebell. That is where i try to perfect my stand and do slow reps to increase tension. Thank you for the suggestions tho, ive been reading alot about how to keep the gains coming and how to advance."

Brogress,33y9yz,TheScion,4,Sun Apr 26 21:26:34 2015 UTC,"Wow. That's quite an awesome transformation. I'm curious, has this change had an effect on your personality/confidence? I'm not trying to insinuate that you necessarily had confidence issues prior, just that the change might have made you more confident."
Brogress,33y9yz,NathanielSamuelKim,12,Sun Apr 26 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"It most definitely has. When I started I was in a pretty bad place (terrible post-breakup depression), but even at my best I wasn't too confident. I don't attribute it all to the changes in my body, but I've definitely learned to be more outgoing, assertive, and, most importantly, ""not give a fuck."" And as much of a douchebag as it may make me sound, people definitely treat me way differently now. It's kinda crazy how that type of constant positive reinforcement helps build confidence."
Brogress,33y9yz,thealec,3,Sun Apr 26 21:29:16 2015 UTC,"I hear you man, learning to not give a fuck about other people's opinions is a huge plus and it's probably why I started gyming. Nice transformation n I'm glad to hear ur doing better man."
Brogress,33y9yz,thealec,4,Mon Apr 27 02:11:09 2015 UTC,"Psh reads these things anyway?   But seriously great job on your bulk and cut. Your triceps look great, especially the outer head. Your legs are looking a little small though. Were you working on getting a good bulk before focusing on big leg definition?"
Brogress,33y9yz,donkeyoil1,3,Mon Apr 27 03:23:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks, working tris is definitely my favorite. Honestly I can just lose myself in it and do 20+ sets.   As for legs, they are most definitely small. I mean much bigger than I started with, but I'm not happy with them at all. Sadly it's the knee injury and the doctor's orders to lay off of most (and sometimes all) lower body training for the past 8 months or so. The pain only bothers me while lifting and occasionally cardio, but never in every day life, so they really are trying to avoid surgery."
Brogress,33y9yz,TatdGreaser,3,Mon Apr 27 03:52:39 2015 UTC,I hear that! My legs are small despite constant training. My pain comes from old rugby injuries.   Tris and delts are on point bro

Brogress,33y9yz,Violator92,3,Mon Apr 27 04:37:52 2015 UTC,Current program is PPL/PPL with a hypertrophy day and a strength day.   Fuck yea dude. I love doing a routine like this. Awesome work man.
Brogress,33y9yz,Texas22,1 point,Mon Apr 27 12:43:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's been great. I love being in the gym, it's pretty customizable, and has had great size and strength results. Just gotta make sure to keep progressing on weights. I've toyed with the idea of using a 5/3/1 progression for the strength days. I originally had been doing PHAT but the upper body power day just works so much better when you split it in two."

Brogress,33y9yz,lmao5plate,2,Mon Apr 27 14:26:52 2015 UTC,Amazing progress!  Congratulations at getting ripped and big.   What shoulder issues did you have and how did you work around them?
Brogress,33y9yz,Avicenna1,2,Mon Apr 27 13:42:40 2015 UTC,"My right shoulder has had recurring pains of varying degrees for the past few years. I have a slightly more than minor case of scoliosis so it makes certain movements not work 100% symmetrically, which adds to the pain if I do too much pressing sometimes. Diagnosis was rotator cuff tendonitis. I've managed to almost completely eliminate the pain by doing lots of shoulder warm ups and mobility, 5ish days a week. Band pull aparts, working on external rotation, daily light face pulls, dislocations, wall slides, and some stretches the PT showed me. It sounds like a lot but it really take 5-10 minutes before the start of each upper body workout. If it flares up I usually take a week or two off benching and just do lighter cable chest work, which somehow doesn't aggravate it at all."

Brogress,33x3ir,PinkBootedBandit,2,Sun Apr 26 19:34:11 2015 UTC,I haven't maxed out yet. I focused on dumbbell a little too heavy and only about a month and a half ago I switched to mainly barbell. Thursday my 5x5 was with 225lbs and I feel I could've done a little more. Squat I haven't gone too heavy because I injured my back a little while ago and I'm still a little scarred to go heavy. My heaviest in a working set was 265lbs. I'll be going for 270lbs today. And deadlift I am working with really light weight because of the lower back injury.

Brogress,33q9aq,reyabc,3,Fri Apr 24 18:30:47 2015 UTC,"I eat a lot of fruits (mangos, berries, plums, nectarines, etc.), veggies (broccoli, spinach, kale, courgette, tomatoes) and fat (EVOO, avocados, peanut butter, grass fed butter). I drink whole milk and eat cottage cheese before bed sometimes. I don't eat a ton of carbs, but when I do it's mostly brown rice, quinoa, and whole wheat bread. For protein I crush a lot of eggs and drink whey/casein. Oh and I have peanut butter oatmeal every single morning and it's delicious. Also I usually take a shot of espresso as soon as I wake up, about 30 min before my workout.   FWIW, the last time I working out regularly, I wasn't a vegetarian, but I haven't had any problems with fatigue or gains now that I don't eat meat.   As far as the strength gains... I think I just had a ton of room for improvement. I used to put up 225 3 years ago so I knew mentally that I should at least be able to get there. Also I'm 23 so I can probably thank testosterone a bit as well."

Brogress,33miom,EuVTL,2,Fri Apr 24 15:54:09 2015 UTC,Yea I think my lifts improved so fast because I lifted a lot in my teens so it was like my muscles already knew what to do. Dedication is key I haven't skipped going to the gym except for when they close due to weather. If I can do it anyone can

Also, that's amazing that you started out at a 250 lb deadlift (and have since improved it tremendously!)  Why do you think your starting max was so high for this particular lift?"
Brogress,33b0wn,skittlesbatch,5,Tue Apr 21 03:52:58 2015 UTC,"She says she started deadlifts one year after everything else, so presumably a high squat, strong back, familiarity with liftig cues, etc helped her.   Still crazy high though."

Brogress,33b0wn,drewbowski22,2,Tue Apr 21 04:37:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't consider my routine a beginner routine.

Brogress,33b0wn,TatdGreaser,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:07:37 2015 UTC,"Well you see at the beginning of the year I weighed 135 pounds and as my new years resolution I've started working out everyday. I'm down to 123-ish pounds and don't think I have to loose any more weight (I'm only 5'6"" so my BMI is 19.5) so instead I've started trying to lift. Granted I don't know a whole lot about it aside from some tips I've gotten from friends but I really do enjoy having muscle :) As for my ultimate goals? A flat stomach would be a good start but I really want a six pack and nicely defined arms; both of which I must say you have and look stunning with."
Brogress,33b0wn,majetuani,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:15:29 2015 UTC,"First off, congrats on sticking with your resolution! The best tip I have is to find and stick to a program that suites your experience level and goals. It seems like your goals are mostly aesthetic. Two programs I  think could be right up your ally are Strong Curves and NROLFW. I have never personally tried them as my goals initially were primarily strength focused, but I have heard great things of them and they are tried and true programs. After you have been on a program for a while you can start to tailor your routine more to personal goals. I didn't start my own routine until about a year ago. Its not generally recommended for beginners to make their own routine as it can result in muscle imbalances and issues that stem from that."
Brogress,33b0wn,njtrafficsignshopper,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:18:15 2015 UTC,Do you know where could I find the Strong Curves and NROLFW workouts? I'd like to give them a shot since I don't really have my own routine. Also do you know if there is a description of the moves somewhere? Because I'm kinda unfamiliar with the terminology of some them. Thanks!

Brogress,33agkw,smarge24,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:10:07 2015 UTC,Yeah summer is just around the corner so that's why I wasn't sure if I should cut/maintain for summer then continue the bulk after August.

Brogress,33agkw,Jax_Masterson,5,Tue Apr 21 01:40:21 2015 UTC,"I would cut dude. You're not fat by any means but the mental benefits of looking really good while having your shirt off are pretty awesome. You can either cut quickly and start a slow bulk halfway through the summer, or cut slowly until like July, maintain for the rest of the summer, and go full on bulk as soon as summer is over. The one caveat I would place on this scenario is that you really focus on your strength work. You can get stronger while cutting, and those strength gains will really come in handy when you recommit to a bulk. JMO."

Brogress,33agkw,MortifiedCucumber,2,Tue Apr 21 00:59:34 2015 UTC,"I know I want to be bigger, which is why part of me wants to bulk. Another part of me thinks that if I do a proper cut I will get the lean look and abs and realize maybe size doesn't matter as much.   I guess I was posting this to ask the question of whether or not I have enough size already to look good after a cut and not be too small."
Brogress,33agkw,Awestin,5,Tue Apr 21 01:04:15 2015 UTC,You're looking good right now and I think that a cut would do you well. You will definitely look a lot better after a cut. Bulking is fun but if you haven't been lean before I think this is a good point to cut and really show all the hard work you've put in
Brogress,33agkw,geoman91,2,Tue Apr 21 01:08:15 2015 UTC,"This is honestly the leanest I've really ever been so thats why part of me is scared to go super lean because I never have. I started out at under 100 lbs skinny fat, and pretty much just a constant bulk with minor cuts."

Brogress,3390zh,protoman999,5,Mon Apr 20 16:51:09 2015 UTC,The beginning ones are probably lower than what I could really do but SL said to start a little lower. I also cheered for the past 2 years so I had some previous strength from that. I ate 100 calories above maintenance for the first 2 months which is when I made most of my strength gains. Now I'm in week 8ish of trying to cut and look more aesthetic so I've kinda stalled out.
Brogress,3390zh,Skelito,5,Mon Apr 20 16:58:01 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you are being downvoted ? Maybe some redditors are jealous of your gains. Those numbers are possible, especially if you took time off and let yourself go. The First month back in the gym you see bigger jumps in your progress than you would if you have been working out for 6 months straight."
Brogress,3390zh,Awestin,2,Mon Apr 20 18:10:42 2015 UTC,That's what I'm saying! I was for before I just let myself go for like 8 months (freshman 15 is real). The first two months I was increasing by 5 pounds easily pretty much every workout.

Brogress,331ha7,parco-molo,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:17:10 2015 UTC,"Right now I'm on my own program where I do chest and shoulders twice a week, and legs and back twice. So Dl 1 day, squats 1 day, variations of bench press twice a week and OHP or arnold press twice. What do you think I'm lacking/should be working on? Cheers"
Brogress,331ha7,imnewtothisI,2,Sun Apr 19 07:32:38 2015 UTC,"An actual program designed by experts that has been shown to be effective via repeated usage.  Seriously, how does an adult male stall on a 5x5 at less than 115 kg squat? And that was a year ago! Get back on 5x5 style or similar program (i.e. a beginner's routine) and eat more if you are somehow stalling."

Brogress,32yyoi,Lutran,2,Sat Apr 18 19:13:42 2015 UTC,No routine? People are going to ask.
Brogress,32yyoi,Milkster,2,Sun Apr 19 04:48:26 2015 UTC,"My bad. I didn't think about it.  I started off doing crossfit in 2003 and quit that maybe a year after the first set of photos here. From there I did Bill Starr's 5x5 for a while until I couldn't handle the volume at which point I went to 5/3/1. I ran that for a couple years, got my lifts to 405lbs for squat, 285lbs for bench, 475 for deadlift, and 185 for press. That was probably three months ago, at which point I had several nagging injuries that seem to prefer a higher rep/volume  lower intensity program. Since then my general week looks like this:  Monday · Back squat in sets of 8 until I can't get 8 reps with good form, back off to about 5 lbs heavier than last week's and perform 2-3 more sets of 8.  · Hang snatch pulls 3-4 x 6, or 6 x 3 depending on if I want to go heavier or not · Stiff leg deadlift 4 x 8-10 · Ab work  Tuesday · Bench up to a max set of 8 · DB bench 4 x 8 heavy · Neutral pull ups 3-4 x 10+ · DB incline bench 3 x 12 moderate to heavy · Modified Pendlay off of blocks (limited flexibility) 4 x 8-10 moderate  · Incline curls 3 x 12 · Face pulls 3 x 15 · Tricep press downs 3 x 15   Thursday · Hybrid deadlift up to max/heavy set of 8, try to get 5 pounds more than last week · Hang snatch pulls 3x6 or 6 x 3 · Back squat 1 x 20 · Ab work  Friday · Seated press to 8 rep max · Neutral pull ups 3-4 x 10+ · DB seated press 4 x 10 - 12 heavy · Meadows row 3 x 10 moderate to heavy · Lateral raises, kind of playing around with reps, sets, and tempos to see which makes me feel it the most. So far very high rep drop sets seem to work well.  · Rear delt kick back 4 x 15 · Face pulls 3 x 15 · Tricep push downs 3 x 15  I have a lot more volume for my upper body days than my lower body days, but I find the upper body work less taxing which allows me to spend less time recovering between sets. Please feel free to give any advice."
Brogress,32tk72,MikeA86,6,Thu Apr 16 16:31:28 2015 UTC,"I would definitely continue with a bulk if I were you. Your squat and dl are pretty good, but if you put on some muscle in your chest I think your bench could shoot up pretty well. I'd probably try to eat around the same calories every day instead of fluctuating between training and rest days unless you train less than 3 days per week. Possibly try a program with more volume than 5/3/1. I think it's safe to say your bench is low enough that if you trained it more, you'd see good progress."
Brogress,32tk72,sellyourself,2,Thu Apr 16 19:33:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's useful. I've always had a stronger lower body than upper and my bench has tended to suck. Higher volume/frequency for incline pressing/benching, you think?   Will try not fluctuating as much with calories. I was going for putting on size while staying lean, hence the slowish muscle gain. But I think I've just got the fear of getting fat if I up the calories too much - I know this probably won't happen and I can't have everything...  Thanks again for the feedback. Much appreciated."
Brogress,32tk72,Milkster,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:53:43 2015 UTC,"You just won't hit 15%+ BF overnight, it's a gradual increase. For someone your height, you could easily be 230+. Yes, to get better at something, do it more often. Want to become a better bencher? Bench more and do more accessory work for chest/shoulders/triceps while still keeping your back up to par."
Brogress,32tk72,Tarqon,2,Fri Apr 17 05:13:39 2015 UTC,"Sorry, forgot to include that. Have been doing Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 for the last 6 months or so. 3/4 days a week, main lifts are press, deadlift, bench and squat on different days. Higher volume assistance exercises (chins, dips, rows, RDLs, split squats and some L-sits). Occasional hill sprints and play hockey once a week."
Brogress,32tk72,LukeatanPeninsula,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:54:37 2015 UTC,"Yup, pretty much. If you're careful and don't overestimate your ""training 1RM"" then the progress is fairly consistent. You can mess around with the different accessory templates as well. I'm a big fan."

Brogress,32pfnr,dudethrowthataway,2,Wed Apr 15 18:05:07 2015 UTC,Jesus that's a lot of volume. Not sure how to word this but do you consider this lifting heavy? Or is this more of a 70%-your-max weights and going for large volume?
Brogress,32pfnr,Zmirburger,2,Wed Apr 15 18:09:55 2015 UTC,"I built it over time but my ""philosophy"" was to try to maintain muscle mass while cutting weight. I used to be a big boy lol. I am no pro obviously lol but I would say most are 70% of my max and I try to do a lot of reps so I get a great workout in."

Brogress,32d1m6,Strength_,4,Sun Apr 12 19:43:19 2015 UTC,What weight is the middle? 205 ish? Also what kind of cals and macros did you have this guy on?
Brogress,32d1m6,NewMeKnewYou,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:58:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would say about 205. I don't require my clients to send me weekly progress pictures so I'm not 100% sure what week that picture was taken.   I had hit on very low carbs for the first 10 weeks. Then low carbs again on week 16.  The macros changed from week to week.   His calorie intake varied but was always from 2150 to 2600.   Week 11-15 was 40%, 35%, 25%. C/P/F.   I had him on a 4 day split in the beginning and we finished the program on a PPL.   If you have any more questions feel free to ask."
Brogress,32d1m6,DoobaDoobaDooba,2,Sun Apr 12 22:11:22 2015 UTC,"I actually just started my first cut last week and am actually almost the same starting stats as your client (6'4"" 218). I was recommended a carb cycling diet of 2300kcal with 40/40/20 pfc on rest days and 2600kcal with 40/20/40 on lifting days (3 per week). Do you think that this will get me results?   I understand that everyone has a different body and the diet will need fine tuning, but on a basic level do you think this is a good place to start?   Unbelievable job with your client btw! Great motivation!"
Brogress,32d1m6,DoobaDoobaDooba,2,Mon Apr 13 13:32:49 2015 UTC,You only lift three times a week? Is bodybuilding your goal or are you just focused on weight loss?   Those calories and macros look good. Stay focused and hit those macros as perfectly as you can the first three weeks. After those first three weeks you will know a lot more about your body and how it reacts to your diet. Stay focused!!!
Brogress,32d1m6,DoobaDoobaDooba,2,Mon Apr 13 14:10:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because of a super busy schedule that's all I can fit in 90% of the time. I do chest/shoulders/tris, back/bis, and legs/abs as my days (day off before legs). My goal is to build muscle and get cut so I guess that falls under body building.  I recently went through a cycle of weight and strength gain (really dirty bulk) shooting from about 200 to 220 and I want to get leaner now before possibly starting a smart, clean bulk. If I had to guess I'd say my bf% is 16-18.  Thanks for the help, man! I've really been trying hard and have done well getting really close to my macros so I'm glad I had someone with more expertise confirm that I am at least on the right track! Gotta put in the work now ;)"
Brogress,32d1m6,DoobaDoobaDooba,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:46:12 2015 UTC,"If you can truly only fit in 3 days a week of training and you would like to see the biggest difference aesthetic-wise, I would recommend a chest/back, arms/shoulders, legs/abs split. This is because your arms and shoulders are your ""beach muscles"" and for beginners they are the most important muscles for aesthetics IMO. They deserve their own day, if you only lift 3x a week. I normally recommend a PPL split, but that's only if you can train more often.   Please note that you will not see amazing results from only weight training 3 days a week, but you will see results with the correct nutrition. (and they can still be very good results)"
Brogress,32d1m6,DAD_FISTER,2,Mon Apr 13 19:06:00 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'm gonna take your advice and change my split. I'm going to do Chest/Back today, abs/legs tomorrow and then shoulders/arms on Thursday.   Another quick questions for you if you wouldn't mind: prior to starting my cut, I was doing most exercises as 4 sets with around 8 reps besides when I would try to up my strength. While cutting would you recommend doing lower reps, more sets like 5x5, reducing my sets by one with the same number of reps, or keeping the 4x8 scheme? Im really afraid of losing muscle and strength as I lose weight so I have no idea which scheme would preserve them the best.  Once again, thank you so much for your advice and your detailed, knowledgeable responses. You are a godsend my friend!"
Brogress,32d1m6,DoobaDoobaDooba,2,Mon Apr 13 21:07:28 2015 UTC,"I would do 4 sets of 8-10. If you want you can burn some extra calories and only take 30-45 second breaks between sets. For me, I prefer to take a least a minute break and just do some light cardio at the end if need be.   If you're hitting your protein and other macros you shouldn't see a big loss in strength. I would even expect your strength to continue growing."
Brogress,32cjpa,simonfuruncle,4,Sun Apr 12 17:16:00 2015 UTC,"I respect your experience, just posting this incase it ends up helping. I recently found it educational, but have less experience lifting.   https://youtu.be/JJ5iCcKzg2Q"

Learning to retract my scapulae was what got me up to 2 plates on bench (I was stuck on 45-35 for like three months), but I definitely don't bring my shoulders down enough according to this video. I'll give that a try to take some stress of my shoulder. Thanks!"
Brogress,32cjpa,tresvian,3,Sun Apr 12 18:10:28 2015 UTC,What helped my chest is to touch my elbows and try to imitate that feeling while benching. Incline helps too. Squeeze the bar like the middle was a spring and you're holding on to the handles.

Brogress,32a4u5,first_five-eighth,8,Tue Jun 9 03:34:29 2015 UTC,"As others have said, pounding water and eating more fiber helps. So does eating slower. This a big oversimplification, but your brain starts to feel full about twenty minutes after your stomach does. Eating a small meal or snack before you start to get REALLY hungry will help fend off cravings.  After a week or two, your body will adjust to the lower intake. Your stomach will actually shrink a bit and you'll feel full with less food in you.  I have a tendency to eat unconsciously when I'm sitting around the house, so spending the whole day out and taking my meals with me helps a lot."
Brogress,32a4u5,LilMissKitKat,3,Sun Apr 12 00:34:03 2015 UTC,"Its funny but I can get full really quick but then about 20 minutes after I start getting snacky and craving sweets. Not sure what exactly this is related to hormonally, maybe the insulin release?"
Brogress,32a4u5,AberHammer87,8,Sun Apr 12 14:37:18 2015 UTC,"Gotta say will power is the biggest factor here.  You will be hungry when cutting.  You're running a caloric deficit.  The longer you last the easier it is.  I eat lots of green veggies to help.  Water, gum, fibre supplements. In Canada ephedrine is over the counter and that works really well."

Brogress,32a4u5,Chilis1,2,Sun Apr 12 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"I wish weed worked for me. Instead, I don't feel hungry AND get so focused on the act of chewing that it freaks me out and I just stop eating. Not too bad if I was on a straight cut, but trying to recomp and train for a meet makes it hard."

Brogress,32a4u5,lolinmarx,2,Sun Apr 12 00:35:54 2015 UTC,"So here's my routine, and it's not that bad to be honest.  I know you say caffeine doesn't do much for you, but it's more of a mental thing then anything.  I wake up around 8, drink a cup of coffee.    Done with that, usually have a second cup.  Right before I go workout at noon/1, I drink a third cup (preworkout).    I then allow myself to finally eat around 2:00.  I've built up a routine that I'm not hungry at all because my body has gotten used to it.  I also eat predominately protein and fats (chicken, lean meat, etc) and very few carbs because carbs are not very filling.    I then eat again at 8:00, and this prevents me from going to bed hungry which is the worst.  I don't drink that much water, but I'm sure this could make me feel more full throughout the day."
Brogress,32a4u5,CHOCOBAM,2,Sun Apr 12 01:33:23 2015 UTC,How bad do you want it?   Drink coffee plain black between meals.  Add some low calorie sweetener if you must. It's hot and the caffeine helps keep you satisfied.
Brogress,32a4u5,NookieNinjas,2,Sun Apr 12 05:43:34 2015 UTC,"Low carb, high fat. Fat and protein keep you full. Carb foods are often high calorie for very little hunger satisfaction. Drink a glass of water with your meal. Set a strict eating schedule and stick to it. Add more time between meals by finding something else to do for 15-30 minutes. Eat your meal slowly over 20-30 minutes. Half the battle is in your head."
Brogress,32a4u5,HeadRollsOff,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:50:38 2015 UTC,"I've been keto for a few months now, it's definitly helped me long term but I have these lapses where I overeat. Yesterday was my worst binge in a long time but I went up to like 4k calories, I'm not sure quite how but yeah."
Brogress,32a4u5,blot101,2,Sun Apr 12 16:29:57 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you have a hard time controlling yourself. Try fasting for 16 hours. Not only will this help with your cut, but it will give you a clearer understanding of your relationship with food and maybe resolve some of the self control issues with which you've been struggling."
Brogress,32a4u5,policeboy4,2,Sun Apr 12 16:38:54 2015 UTC,"Maybe don't eat entire blocks of freaking cheese, and go buy some fresh fruit and vegetables to add to your meals. Broccoli, spinach, cabbage, lettuce, celery, spring onions, cucumbers, tomatoes,  etc.   Also get some snacking fruit like bananas, apples, oranges.   If these sound bland to you, then also get a jar of nice mustard, a vinegar, a nice bottle of olive oil, maybe some honey, a bottle of your favourite hot sauce, salt and pepper. And you can eat these things with different low cal dressing everynight of the week. Just be careful with the honey and oil.  You can feel full as hell, while on a cut if you make smart choices. And stop buying crap at the supermarket."

Brogress,32a4u5,policeboy4,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:03:08 2015 UTC,"I find eating a mountain of veg as a large part of my dinner definitely helps! Stuff like broccoli has really low calories, so you can eat a large volume of it, and then don't feel like having dessert. I also find drinking pints of water helps.  But honestly, other than that it's brain training. Getting into the habit of eating less, and choosing low calorie foods above high calorie stuff like peanut butter, cheese, butter, biscuits, cake. It's savoring your food, knowing the difference between 'hungry' and 'not completely full', embracing those moments when you do feel a little hungry as a reminder that you're kicking arse, and thinking ahead (I could eat 1,200 calories for lunch, but if I eat 600 now, then I can have a whole 600 more later!).  Sometimes it's shit, but only sometimes :-)"
Brogress,32a4u5,Jollywog,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:59:27 2015 UTC,"Personally, I eat a pound of broccoli before every meal. Its an extra 3 dollars per day. The next think I eat is a big piece of chicken, a cup of coffee, and an egg. then a banana, then if I'm still hungry ill have a glass of water and wait 20 minutes. Then if I'm aching for food, I'll eat spaghetti with cheese.  I stopped getting to the point of needing spaghetti eventually.     I used to count calories, but after I did this a while I figured it was kind of hard to eat like this and get too many calories.  Plus, the calories I do get have a hard time sticking around unless they're contributing to my muscle or recovery."

But you don't need to eat 5000 calories a day at 135 pounds to gain weight, that is full blown ridiculous.   All you're doing is gaining a shit load of fat that you're going to want to deal with later, and the lifestyle you're currently living isn't even remotely sustainable.   If you ate 3000cals decent-ish cals a day, you would have got to where you are now within a few months, but have a significantly lower bf.  I'm really not knocking your progress, each to there own, but I don't want to see some kids reading your post and thinking they have to eat 5000cals, worst case scenario giving up, or best case simply getting fat and disillusioned.

Motivates me and Greg Plit was certainly a talented speaker rest his soul.   As for the height I'm still pretty young and i assumed i was 6'2 ahah. After doing measurements properly (not replying on doctors - they tend to add an inch) i released i am in fact 6'1 although i wish i was 6'2.   For sure wasn't muscle i lost!

Brogress,31tsk0,bruceville_road,5,Wed Apr 8 03:27:21 2015 UTC,Thanks! I wouldn't say they're amazing but i appreciate the awesome compliment. I train shrugs with dumbbells for sets of 30-50 every upper body day and i also do facepulls 3-4 times a week to keep my shoulders healthy. I love facepulls because when done right they hit the mid to upper traps really well (and obviously the rear delts).
Brogress,31tsk0,bruceville_road,7,Wed Apr 8 03:35:59 2015 UTC,"How much weight would you say you use with the dumbbells, and I maybe misunderstanding you on this one - 30-50 reps?"
Brogress,31tsk0,Joey208,11,Wed Apr 8 03:48:48 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah multiple sets of 30-50 reps. I used to shrug really heavy on a barbell but it never worked as well as really high rep full range of motion dumbbell shrugs. I start around 50lbs for sets of 50 and will go up to 80 for sets of 30. Sometimes I'll use a barbell for heavy sets of 8-12, but I always finish with high rep dumbbell work."

Brogress,31ljex,ZC89,6,Mon Apr 6 05:06:56 2015 UTC,"Dependant on your day to day lifestyle I think at 5'10 you could easily up your calories a bit more, especially as you're on a four day.   I'm at 5'11 workout 5 days and have a sit down job and my maintenance works out to be around the 2400-2600 mark, and I bulk at around 3000, well my discipline is crap so I bulk at like infinity cals.  I mean it's entirely dependant on your goals and if you wanna put on a bit more weight. I reckon you could hit another 25lbs, almost as lean as you've already done, in less than three years moving forward.  I know basically all I've said is more cals = more size, which is pretty obvious. I just think you've got a bit of wiggle room to eat more without becoming a fat mess."
Brogress,31ljex,Ed-0510,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:53:55 2015 UTC,I've worked with the idea of more calories but it's definitely tough to fit into a day. I respect the hell out of anyone who can manage 3000+ calories and keep it clean. But it's not ruled out as of right now. If i'm unhappy with my results over the next few months i'll be making those changes. Thanks for the input!
Brogress,31ljex,hazytimez,2,Mon Apr 6 16:34:11 2015 UTC,"Just a tip if looking to consume more calories:  Make a big brotein shake! In mine, I have 1.5 cups milk, a banana, big scoop of peanut butter (50-60g), 2 scoops of ON protein powder, and 1/2 cup oats. This totals to around 1000-1200 calories, and is packed with tons of each macronutrient. It only takes about 15 minutes to make and 5 minutes to drink, so if you're busy and trying to bulk harder, I would definitely recommend it."

Specifically, what kind of progressions were you at from the beginning and how long did it take you to progress into the more advanced ones? Really just looking to compare; that's really motivating and just want to make sure I'm on track. Thanks man!"
Brogress,316flb,dcgigs,2,Thu Apr 2 15:36:45 2015 UTC,"When i first started i just did the beginner routine without the pull ups ( got a pull up bar 2 months later).  My progressions were for push ups : decline push ups for 3x 12 reps and then diamond push ups. After getting 3x8+ reps on the diamond push ups i went to pseudo planche push ups on the floor and later to the rings with weights (took me 6 months to get there) which are better for my hands :D.  Dips: chair dips with the legs on the ground for 3-4 months and later i just went to ring dips when i bought them and added weights.  Rows: i already started at tucked front lever rows since i got the pull up bar abit later and i do them on rings now since you can get a better range of motion with them.  Pull ups: I used the grease the groove method for this one since i could only do 5 chin ups / 3 pull ups and when i reached 20+ chin ups and 15+ pull ups ( after 5 months ) i also added some weights.  L-sit: started with a tucked L-sit and it took me like 3-4 months to get to a 1 leg tucked l-sit and about 7 months for a full L-sit.  Some advanced moves: I can do the human flag now, a freestanding handstand push up and one arm push ups. Muscles ups and the planche are still too hard for me."

The rest was just IIFYM but i tried to eat meat everyday.  On the bulk i eat the cottage cheese joghurt once per day in the evening and 100g oats 350ml milk and 30g whey (850 calories, fibers and 45g protein) in the morning. The rest was also just IIFYM but on a bulk i only ate 4-5 times per week meat since i had more calories to get protein from other sources."
Brogress,318ztr,Jamon_Iberico,6,Thu Apr 2 23:19:26 2015 UTC,Definitely keep bulking for a while man. Do a slow bulk (~350 calories over tdee) to allow yourself to put on quality weight. Keep your macros right and be consistent and you'll continue to see great gains

Usually I'd be painting walls, chipping out old bricks, shoveling rubble,etc. but often I'd have to carry 50lb/60lb cement bags, paint, etc. It wasn't the hardest of jobs but it was a quite tiring working 40-50 hours a week. I rarely had the energy and time to go to the gym after work after I got home, and I'd have to bike 20 minutes to the gym to get there. On top of that, hot days + a labor job left with me a weakened appetite. I'd be so tired after getting home I'd just want to pass out."

Brogress,314b9r,gotteric,0,Thu Apr 2 22:13:14 2015 UTC,You're on week 8....... Take a look at yourself again at the 6 month mark. If you've been consistent you should see a noticeable difference.
Brogress,314b9r,Billytown,4,Thu Apr 2 05:04:22 2015 UTC,"You could also try posting in r/weightroom. It's more geared (pun intended) towards lifting performance but that's OK. Personally, I think there is also value in r/bodybuilding, mostly because there is a wide variety of goals people have and the community is generally accepting of physique goals (assuming you don't put down someone else's goals in the process).   Anyway.. In my experience, when people are in the early stages the priorities for lifting are, in increasing order of importance, workout intensely, workout frequency, and don't get injured. There honestly isn't more to it when you are new.   With respect to eating, what worked for me is close to what you're doing now. I used MFP, and still sometimes do, BUT with one big caveat. I always overestimated my calories by 10% and underestimated my protein by about the same. The reason being that I was not at a stage where macro precision was necessary and humans are awful at estimating. Unless you're eating something that is prepackaged with nutritional info or weighing everything out (volume is much easier to screw up) eating more than you expect can happen really easily.   I hope this helps.  tl;dr people who are just starting to get in shape don't need precision and optimization, just dedication and intensity (and a few helpful tricks)"
Brogress,314b9r,chinchillin88,1 point,Thu Apr 2 01:54:34 2015 UTC,Thank you- that is a great tip. I'm going to drop my cals down and take your suggestions about estimating. It HAS to be a diet problem if I'm stalling this long.   I'm Also very tempted to go 4 days a week lifting and having a cardio focus 2 days a week. I'm worried this will slow down fat loss though.
Brogress,314b9r,bumbuff,11,Thu Apr 2 02:17:25 2015 UTC,"You're screwing up somewhere in the kitchen. If you aren't absolutely on top of your diet, you're wasting your time, seriously. You say you've been tracking since last fall but haven't seen any progress, in which case you're cheating yourself somewhere, not counting something you're putting in your mouth, and/or your calorie targets for the day are way too high. (If you're not losing weight, you're still eating too much... duh...) Or your ""cheat"" days are out of control (you shouldn't even have them if you're truly serious about reaching your goals as quickly as possible).    There isn't anything magical about this process. Given what you've said, I'd guess your calorie intake is out of whack and needs to be significantly lower. At your size, with your lack of strength, you probably don't have a lot of muscle which means you have a really high abundance of fat. That shit needs to GO. Keep lifting, you can make gains, but you sound like you need to get a handle on your food intake.  I've worked with guys in your condition. I've never seen one actually make it. I hope you're different."
Brogress,314b9r,theoccassional,2,Wed Apr 1 22:52:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, if you're not loosing weight on the current amount of calories, cut 100 calories a week and see if you lose weight. Sounds like you want to cut more than you want to bulk. I'd say 2490 is a just about enough calories to NOT make a deficit, so go slowly with lowering your calories. I used a basic Calorie counter for your height and age you should be eating 1900 - 2100 calories for weight loss. Not for muscle gain. You may feel a little hungry because the amount of food you've been eating, but that's normal when your dropping calories, stick to the numbers and you will see results. I forgot what article I read, but unless you're training like an olympic athlete with cardio (like Michael Phelps spending 6 hours in the pool, multiple days a week) then you aren't losing muscle mass by going on the treadmill, rower, or stair stepper machine during your training for 30-45 mins after you lift. Cardio is not your enemy for getting ripped and boxing will greatly help in getting cut.  If the aesthetic your looking for is more big and muscular, that's a slightly different methodology that I don't know too much about. But think about this, it's easier to maintain a lean ""bro"" look when your lower in weight than it is to be a massive guy."
Brogress,314b9r,bumbuff,2,Thu Apr 9 14:28:56 2015 UTC,Diet. Diet. Diet. Somethings up.  Tracking your diet becomes your religion.
Brogress,314b9r,bumbuff,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:14:17 2015 UTC,"Reply to both (u/Billytown) as well-  I know. Calories in/Calories out. It’s really very simple. I just went over MFP and I’ve tracked every damn thing. Like I said-I don’t even keep track of exercise cals on the thing. Just food.  I can not see where it’s off, but I suppose it absolutely must be. Both MFP and the TDEE tracker I used put me at about a 3500 TDEE, so 2500 would give me about two pounds a week loss. Maybe it’s off and maybe my TDEE is closer to 3000, so I should drop to 2000 a day?  u/Billytown - as for the strength, it’s my only complaint with SS5X5. I don’t feel particularly challenged. I’ve added my weight every workout as instructed but I’m nowhere near what my max would be. I understand the point is - of course- to gain strength steadily, but I know I can lift heavier. Just trying to stick to the program.  The fat has to go. The link I posted to the other user is pretty much exactly where I’m at looks wise, albeit a bit taller. Admittedly, I have lost a significant portion of weight since I first started hitting the gym 5-6 days a week, but I’m stalling badly.  I suppose my question is - how does one even gain results like the ones I found here and posted on a deficit? I always figured I could gain muscle once I was able to start eating above TDEE, but it seems it can be done along with weight loss.   I will drop the daily cals to 2,000 and see if things start happening. Is it time to switch to a more intermediate 4xday a week lifting program? Keep the boxing to two days a week and the cals down to 2,000? I’m worried less cardio means slower fat loss.  Is not feeling challenged enough on SS5X5 a sign it’s time to move on?  I’ve read on a few bro-sciency subreddits that lifting on a relatively empty stomach is fine. I’ve been lifting early morning on a banana only followed by breakfast. Maybe leave it to the end of the day with food in my stomach?  Stupid question: Carbs ok after evening lifting for weight loss? (a potato say?)  Forgive the questions - I’ve researched all of them and I’ve seen a million different answers.   I've worked with guys in your condition. I've never seen one actually make it. I hope you're different.”    -This hit me right in the feels Thank you for the brutal honesty/inspiration. I am determined to make it"
Brogress,314b9r,cmw69krinkle,4,Wed Apr 1 23:53:10 2015 UTC,"If you've been putting everything in your log, do the math to find your TDEE. No need.to guesstimate when you have all the data readily available. Calculators are for starting off, but you will need to observe and adjust over time based on your experience."
Brogress,314b9r,Little-Big-Man,2,Thu Apr 2 00:57:24 2015 UTC,I’m worried less cardio means slower fat loss.   Maybe you need something else?  Cardio/Weights didn't really give me the results I wanted.  I started alternating between 2.5 months bootcamp and 2.5 months of Cardio/Weights.   I've seen uber gains.
Brogress,314b9r,Little-Big-Man,2,Thu Apr 2 00:05:21 2015 UTC,I box a few nights a wee which involves a LOT of bootcampy stuff.   This is where I always get confused. Lift more or cardio more?
Brogress,314b9r,Donedunit,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:31:07 2015 UTC,"That depends on what your primary goal is right now: bulk or cut?    I am in no way certified to tell you what you should or should not do.  However, personal experience has taught me that trying to do both at the same time is very hard.   If I were in your shoes, and I was only a decade ago, I'd be focusing on a cut first.  Get the weight down for summer time, look nice and trim.    When I first started to cut, I typically dropped my calories to 1200 per day as a default.  And then tack on more as I exercise. As you put on some muscle, you'll move up your default amount.   As for cardio during my cut phase, I typically do 2-40 minute bike rides or stationary bike a day. One before work, one after. Lifting is done in the morning too. During the summer I also like to mix in 1 or 2 laps across a local lake."
Brogress,310xya,JRBrinnehh,7,Wed Apr 1 06:17:04 2015 UTC,You're ready for a bulk. Hit then delts hard so they can catch up to your arms

Brogress,310xya,fallacybuffet,3,Thu Apr 2 18:35:48 2015 UTC,"You wont look shredded. I'd rather be 150lbs 10% bodyfat, than 130lbs 7% bodyfat. You need a lot of muscle to look shredded, which you don't have.   Not hating, but dont be delusional."
Brogress,310xya,NigBeCray,3,Mon Apr 6 07:22:35 2015 UTC,"I hope this isn't against the rules of the /r/brogress, but to the ""bulk vs cut"" debate, I just wanted to add that over at /r/ketogains we also believe in a third option, called the recomp--body recomposition.  The plan is to eat a few hundred calories more than TDEE on workout days and a few hundred calories less on rest days.  Obviously, this works best on a 3- or 4-workouts per week schedule.  And all while keeping in ketosis, of course.  The result is a long, slow recomposition, as you gain muscle from lifting while burning bodyfat for energy on deficit days.  PS.  You look awesome, dude.  Show it off this summer!"

Brogress,30fk5k,WankMeOff,0,Mon Mar 30 18:25:07 2015 UTC,"The thing is, my weight varies on different scales... on the most accurate medical scale, I am 174ish... I will admit a lot of my weight is in my legs, and I really do eat well over 4000 calories a day... but regardless I am not going to stop, I just may need to eat even more"
Brogress,30fk5k,SuperMayonnaise,2,Mon Mar 30 23:15:11 2015 UTC,"pic of the wheels? I feel like you're greatly underestimating how much food ""well over 400cals"" is. but agree to disagree, you're looking to better yourself just like all of us so that's great."

Brogress,30fk5k,britishweather1,1 point,Sat Apr 4 04:37:41 2015 UTC,That's not how it works.   For example you log your food by estimates and you dont weight it that's why you think you eat 4000 calories but in reality its only 3000.
Brogress,30fk5k,SuperMayonnaise,0,Sat Apr 4 07:17:36 2015 UTC,"I eat about 4200 I don't think you get how much food it is. Carb wise it's equal to 4 entire cups of rice, protein and fats about 24 oz of chicken and 14 eggs. This isn't my diet plan at all but just to give you an idea of the volume of food that is."
Brogress,30fk5k,jonhova,1 point,Sat Apr 4 07:47:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah.... I really do. I don't guesstimate calories too much. I literally eat entire boxes of pasta, cereal, ice cream, etc everyday to make sure I hit the calories. Stuff like chicken I buy frozen and divide up based on how many servings are in the bag. So unless the serving sizes on the packages are lying, I really do eat the amount I calculate.   Like I'm not totally oblivious to what a certain amount of calories looks like. I have a feeling I just naturally burn it off though."

Brogress,307hd7,jeanhyuk,9,Wed Mar 25 03:27:14 2015 UTC,"I feel stupid for not having it checked out by a doctor but it's muscular, I know that. I've been to a few casual massage therapists which have helped me figure out exactly what muscles are being affected so I've been working on them and it's gotten better. I just have to stretch and go at it with a foam roller about an hour a day. Pretty much every muscle in my hips is constantly pulling... Planning on going to a sports physical therapist when I get the chance to do so."

Neurologists have some knowledge and can help you get things scanned but the treatment they'll suggest is probably what you're already doing. Not much you can do about it, unfortunately.  Source: chronically tight, sore muscles, seen 25 doctors and tried 3 different treatments with limited results. They don't even know what's wrong."

Brogress,307hd7,BloodhoundGang,7,Wed Mar 25 19:17:20 2015 UTC,"That's including warming up, abs and stretching/foam rolling afterwards, so I suppose my workouts tend to be around an hour and  a half depending on the day."

Brogress,307hd7,virilantix,2,Wed Mar 25 23:20:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, not till the end. I took the cut slow at first so my body could adjust then steadily kept dropping calories till I was regularly eating around 1,800. I wanted to experiment how low I could take it and ate about 1,500 near the end. That's really the only time I noticed a significant loss in strength and some muscle mass."
Brogress,307hd7,virilantix,2,Wed Mar 25 23:34:56 2015 UTC,Were you using cutting agents? such as clen or EC stack?
Brogress,307hd7,Nutella_Boy,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:41:43 2015 UTC,"No cutting agents, but I drank coffee like my life depended on it. Mostly to subdue my cravings. Will probably try an EC stack the next time I cut, though."

Brogress,307hd7,DwelveDeeper,9,Wed Mar 25 04:02:31 2015 UTC,"No problem man. I suggest you get my fitness pal to track what you're eating so you get a grasp of how many calories you're getting exactly but I eat 2 cups of oatmeal, 12oz of chicken, two glasses of whole milk, two bananas, four scoops total of protein powder, 50g of dextrose (sugar), some random meal that has 800 calories w/ 40g of protein and like 4 tablespoons of peanut butter. it takes time eating your way up to it but you'll adjust and what works for me might not work for you so you just gotta learn what you can and can't work with for whatever reason. My fitness pal is almost essential though, I strongly recommend it."
Brogress,307hd7,BjornarShock,5,Wed Mar 25 04:36:16 2015 UTC,"4000 calories on pretty clean food? Respect brotha. Great gains man, youve clearly put in the work and research."
Brogress,307hd7,policeboy4,2,Wed Mar 25 13:31:38 2015 UTC,"2 cups of oatmeal is like 200g of carbs, 2 bananas at most 80g, two glasses of whole milk like ~30g, 50g dextrose and 4 tbsp of PB is ~15g = 375g or max would be 400. You still need another 190g, wouldn't you forgot rice, sweet potatoes, pasta or something?  Sick progress!"
Brogress,307hd7,policeboy4,2,Sat Mar 28 21:53:51 2015 UTC,"You're right, I forgot I have a 24 ounce smoothie that's roughly 150g of carbs... Glad you looked that up, apparently I'm not eating as much as I should."
Brogress,307hd7,Terateu,2,Sat Mar 28 22:33:26 2015 UTC,how much do you spend on food? i'm really struggling to make ends meet when i try to eat properly.
Brogress,307hd7,virilantix,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:05:39 2015 UTC,"I spend kind of a lot honestly, but luckily I'm in a situation where I can do so comfortably. I'd say I spend around $400 a month but if you stick to mainly eating chicken and oatmeal/rice for your protein and carb macros, you'll save a lot. Just remember to get in some vegetables if you can. Gotta get those nutrients, man. And whole milk is pretty cheap and a good source of fats and protein."

Brogress,303ach,narkazokh,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:19:57 2015 UTC,I calculated my TDEE using the formula with the little/no exercise level. That puts me at 2500 for maintenance and I tried to eat anywhere from 1800-2000 calories. If I did cardio I allowed myself to eat a couple hundred more calories. I kept a daily log of my weight and adjusted my calories every three weeks if necessary.
Brogress,303ach,narkazokh,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:34:23 2015 UTC,"did you lift at all or just in general had better success using the no exercise option? the reason i ask is bc im lifting 4-5x per week with 2-3x of cardio but the no exercise option seems to be working better...but just for 6'2 210, 2100 cals feels low"
Brogress,303ach,zzfish1095,1 point,Thu Mar 26 00:24:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I lifted and did some cardio. I thought the calories felt low at first but the weight was coming off at a decent rate. Not too fast. Just gotta start with something and tweak as you go. Make sure weight yourself everyday at the same time. Makes it easy to tweak if you need to

Brogress,2zzctq,Phil_Dakuchi,3,Mon Mar 23 15:49:37 2015 UTC,"Bench is at 265, squat I don't really max but I think the most I ever did was 315 for 3. And honestly I haven't deadlifted in the last ~6 months but my back has grown tremendously. Now I do heavy rack pulls and shit tons of rows and pull ups/downs. But when I did max out my dead it was at 395. The reason why I don't deadlift is after doing them I find that the amount of volume I can do for back in rows etc reduces by a lot."
Brogress,2zzctq,Phil_Dakuchi,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:41:40 2015 UTC,"Good info thx. Btw have you done SL 5x5? I'm starting that program right now after mostly just bodyweight strength training and a few months of also incorporating bench and low bar squats into the mix. I'm pretty satisfied with how I look at the moment, but I'm mainly excited to see my 1RM's after doing SL. 1000lb club is one of my goals."
Brogress,2zzctq,ballerhoops,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:33:15 2015 UTC,"I tried it for a little when I started. But honestly if your goal is bodybuilding max numbers don't really matter.

I'm assuming that's the end of my noob gains, and I wanna work on purely strength for a while before I go back to aesthetics as my lifts are still pretty low. Bench 1RM is 250 with good form, havent tested squat but i can do 5x5 @ 200. I feel like I still have a lot to gain in terms of strength, and I hope some more muscle will come along with that and not too much fat while I do SL for the next 12 weeks.  Also when I heard about 1000lbs I saw myself wanting to do that, but I'm definitely not tryna be a fatass powerlifter (not like thats even possible as I'm an ecto)"

Brogress,2zzctq,parco-molo,5,Mon Mar 23 06:16:03 2015 UTC,"I kinda feel this way about this entire subreddit. And there is also a big difference between a 25 year old doing it, A 35 year old, and a 45 year old doing it. However, I don't want to discourage anyone of any age. Now being in my 40's I realize it takes SO much more work and discipline than it did at 25. It really really sucks as your metabolism slows down in life.   Let all young readers of this be aware and let this info spur you past any procrastination. Do it now. Be healthy now. The pay offs in two decades are immeasurable. I see so many other 40-somethings who were never physically fit when younger and now have so much more trouble with daily life and health. Relative to them, I don't because I had some level of dedication when I was younger that has made my bones stronger and my general health better than average for being 40 something. It's nice when I go in for the annual physical and the doctor says ""Ok, you can skip a year"". Mean while I'm shocked at the number of co-workers and friends of the same age that have multiple prescriptions, problems sleeping, no energy, etc. I think being active makes a HUGE difference that can make your immediate quality of life better, then also later quality of day to day life is good."

Brogress,2zzctq,ReMaine,2,Mon Mar 23 15:51:57 2015 UTC,I'm 42 and started lifting in December. The good thing is that I have so much more discipline and patience now than I had when I was younger. I'm happy seeing some small results after 3 months and I do this to look better a year or two from now and being able to live an active life as a retiree 25-45 years from now. When I was a teenager I couldn't bother doing something that didn't pay off immediately: three weeks was an eternity.

Brogress,302i8r,phteven24,7,Mon Mar 23 23:43:52 2015 UTC,1 month progress...
Brogress,302i8r,G0hanTheSaiyan,3,Wed Mar 25 18:52:52 2015 UTC,"Since you aren't training legs, you should try to gain (at most) two pounds per month. If you started doing heavy weighted squats you could bump that up to a maximum of four pounds per month. Both maximums are assuming you want to stay relatively lean."

Brogress,2zyz4n,clipartghost,0,Mon Mar 23 14:55:49 2015 UTC,"You do 4 warmup sets then? That seems a bit excessive at that weight, but if it works it works.  Also you might want to consider tracking your calories or at least increasing them- if you average 1750/day now try 1900 for example. 0.5 lbs/month is extremely conservative; you would probably benefit from more."

Brogress,2zyz4n,turn30left,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:56:01 2015 UTC,"Solid progress.  What are your goals, though?  You gained 7lbs, so I'm guessing you're trying to put on muscle?  You should really get your diet in check.  Tracking cals isn't that tough to do, it really only takes a couple minutes a day, it's just a hard habit to get into.  But if you really want to see progress you need to know how many calories and protein you're getting so when you hit a wall you can adjust accordingly.  Also good to get into the habit for when you want to start cutting again.  I never believe anyone that claims to know how many calories they eat without tracking because almost everyone that does that is way off (myself included when I tried)."
Brogress,2zyz4n,turn30left,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:04:09 2015 UTC,Great work. Your stomach has flattened out nicely. Have you noticed your pants starting to get tight around the thighs due to muscle gain?

Brogress,2zwcpn,theoccassional,6,Sun Mar 22 13:28:57 2015 UTC,It's all in your head. I think some people confuse bitch tits with nipple placement. Some dudes just have nips that point down. I can't even see what your talking about. Get huge

I've been going at it a lot more aggressive these last 2 months. As for workouts I need to get a set routine putting on strength is getting harder specifically my bench. I've been stuck at 285 for a little while now. I typically lift 4 days a week It looks something like this.  Monday: Upper body Tuesday: Lower body Wednesday: Cardio/Abs Thursday: Upper Body Friday: Lower Body Saturday: Off Sunday: Cardio/Abs  I bench on both upper body days. The first upper body day consist of bench as my primary strength workout followed by arm workouts that support bench, the second upper body day is going to focus on shoulders/delts/back with bench as my secondary. I will typically focus on benching for reps on this day.   On lower body days the first one will focus on squat followed by leg press, calf raises, quad extensions, and leg curls. Sometimes I will use the prowler or flip tractor tires for some extra work. The second lower body day looks the same but rather than squat I dead lift."

Brogress,2zoju0,WILDCOX,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:48:06 2015 UTC,"Try mixing it up more. I used to do the same thing until my buddy showed me something different. Instead of chest and triceps, try chest and biceps. Instead of back and biceps, try back and triceps. Dedicate a day to deadlifting and one to squatting. Instead of using bench press as your main chest exercise, try doing weighted dips and for back weighted pull-ups. I started doing all of this and it was like going to the gym for the first time again.  Normally when I would do chest and triceps together, by the time I got to triceps they would be worn out already from doing chest, so I couldn't push them as hard with heavy weights. It's kind of like, you can either get a half ass tricep workout or you can go hard as shit on some biceps. I choose to go hard as shit, but that's just me.   If you want to just keep doing what you are doing one thing I think you should do is this... M --chest + triceps T --back + biceps W --legs and shoulders Th -- triceps + chest F --biceps + back S --shoulders + legs S -- rest  ...just to make sure you can hit biceps, triceps, and shoulders while you are fresh.   Edit: If you are going to downvote me because you think I'm full of shit, how about you respond with a counter argument."
Brogress,2zoju0,WILDCOX,2,Fri Mar 20 16:03:37 2015 UTC,"Awesome tips man! My PR on DL was 4 plates for a single rep but I never reached that more than twice. I'm on a low carb cut now so I feel really weak on DL but I do them every week twice! I mix up my routine with going heavy on chest on the first day and going heavy on tris the other. I do this the same with back biceps legs and shoulders. So I train every part hard each week.  I will try to do some weighted stuff next week, I'm looking forward to try some new stuff man!"

Brogress,2zi59z,DesertDrummer,6,Wed Mar 18 21:13:45 2015 UTC,I was eating roughly (a lot of estimation) 3000 calories during my bulk. Now on my cut I am cutting at a much more precise measurement of 2000 calories. I have noticed only a minimal amount of strength decrease. So I'm assuming it has been largely fat loss which is good. A huge thing that has helped me is I've been drinking a lot less. I used to have a beer or even two every night with dinner and that really adds up. Now I barely drink at all (maybe once a month for a night out) and have replaced the vice with seltzer which helps curb my appetite.

Brogress,2z50x1,parco-molo,8,Sun Mar 15 23:48:38 2015 UTC,"Just ran some numbers for anyone interested:  Assuming he was 10% bf before and 10% after, he gained 3.1 pounds of fat and 27.9 pounds of muscle.  That works out to (on average) approximately .54 pounds of muscle a week, or ~2.16 pounds a month. Definitely within the realm of what is achieved by people in their first year of training, especially when you're at that age."
Brogress,2z50x1,Zephyrv,2,Mon Mar 16 07:08:09 2015 UTC,"A 9:1 muscle:fat ratio is pretty bonkers though. If true, that certainly can't be expected for the average person."
Brogress,2z50x1,Zephyrv,2,Mon Mar 16 14:06:41 2015 UTC,"Read about p-ratio here  The leaner you are when you begin, the greater your LBM gain:fat gain ratio. Seeing as OP was a hungry skeleton starting out...  Further, 10% is a pretty conservative estimate for the after pic. Each additional 1% increase in the true BF% would equate to a 1.5 pound increase in the amount of fat.  11%: 4.6 fat, 26.4 muscle = 5.7 ratio 12%: 6.1 fat, 24.9 muscle = 4.1 ratio 13%: 7.6 fat, 23.4 muscle = 3.07 ratio  As you can see, even a little deviation from my conservative estimation greatly reduces the ratio."

Brogress,2yxp79,DAD_FISTER,1 point,Sat Mar 14 01:14:50 2015 UTC,"I have switched to ab wheel 5 sets of 20 reps. Then after, I basically do crunches on a ball, 5 sets of 10. The trick that I do, is to really focus on squeezing your abs."
Brogress,2yyilu,dirtystilts,3,Fri Mar 13 22:13:52 2015 UTC,"Personally I would continue bulking for a bit.  But, for you, it depends on when you want to stop. If you want to cut for summer, start at the appropriate time. If your ok going more, than do so! If you decide to continue to bulk, just don't get too fat lol. You still look fine now, like you easily could keep going. But, if you decide to cut now, you will look very strong. Keep an eye on bf % if you decide to bulk more! Amazing progress, keep it up!"
Brogress,2yyilu,nnet3,1 point,Sat Mar 14 03:53:10 2015 UTC,"My original goal was to bulk up to 185 before I cut down, I'm just worried I might take on too much body fat with that goal. If I were to cut, I would probably bulk back up afterwords honestly as I am nowhere near the end goal yet."
Brogress,2yyilu,nnet3,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:43:20 2015 UTC,"I think you are fine to keep bulking for a while. If you feel uncomfortable about your weight, then cut. It is up to how you feel. Good luck!"

Brogress,2yvg17,NookieNinjas,2,Fri Mar 13 04:04:05 2015 UTC,No. My lower-body is proportionally sized and strong but not as developed(i.e lack of obvious teardrop etc.Also i'm a pretty hairy guy waist down so it's not nearly as aesthetically pleasing unless I trim my lowerbody hair). I train quads/glutes/calves/hams once a week. I want to push for more but I play basketball and the DOMS I get limits my play if I push for 2 leg days a week. Hope that helps.
Brogress,2yvg17,Avicenna1,7,Fri Mar 13 04:53:30 2015 UTC,"You've mentioned that your hairiness isn't aesthetically pleasing before. You know that's just in your head right? You're a man. Embrace it, because there's a whole lot of people out there that love hairiness."
Brogress,2yvg17,Avicenna1,2,Fri Mar 13 12:48:43 2015 UTC,I'm not entirely in denial of being a hairy man. But when it comes to presenting one's muscles less hair (imo) increases definition. I appreciate the encouragement though!

If you want to balance strength and size ICF. Personally I'm doing ICF until I hit 180 bench and then I'll do a brosplit."

Brogress,2yp9gn,Wheyman92,6,Wed Mar 11 18:26:14 2015 UTC,Whats your training split look like? Total calorie intake?
Brogress,2yp9gn,villainouscoke,9,Wed Mar 11 18:31:56 2015 UTC,"My training varies, but I have had more structured lifting programs in the past! I do not train chest (ever) and very rarely hit biceps or triceps because I have a specific look I'm aiming for. I tend to hit biceps inadvertently on back day so they do get worked. I spent a large portion of last year trying to grow my triceps - then realized I don't really like them that big so I'm letting them fade back a little.  That being said, I always have 2 leg days (one more quad focused, one more hamstring focused), shoulders 1x week, back 1x week, abs & calves get their own day. I usually do some type of cardio every day (I rest if I need to) and don't track it or have a set amount (typically ~ 25 min incline treadmill).   Sunday: legs/quads  Monday: shoulders  Tuesday: rest  Wednesday: legs/hams  Thursday: abs/calves  Friday: rest  Saturday: rest, or restart split/cycle, or tris/abs (clean up day)  I go by my schedule and/or how I'm feeling, what's sore, etc. Rest days move around but I try to keep my leg days spread apart and try not to hit Shoulders and Back on consecutive days.  Calories are around ~1800 right now.. I follow macros not cals  Protein: at least 150g/day  Carbs: 200g at the moment (changes)  Fats: ~30g/day"
Brogress,2yp9gn,moarcheesepls,5,Wed Mar 11 19:15:02 2015 UTC,Have you ever encountered being unbalanced from never training chest? Any postural issues? I train similarly and would like to drop the chest training as well but I don't want any weird side effects.
Brogress,2yp9gn,clipartghost,7,Wed Mar 11 22:33:44 2015 UTC,"I have to assume you're a female.. otherwise pls train chest lol. But no, I haven't noticed any negative effects from not training it! I have implants and don't like the way the muscle contracts around them - looks and feels weird.. so I definitely don't want to build that area."
Brogress,2yp9gn,hasmany,0,Thu Mar 12 03:54:46 2015 UTC,why would being female have anything to do with training chest?
Brogress,2yp9gn,turn30left,6,Sun Mar 15 15:32:57 2015 UTC,"I think girls have valid reasons to avoid training chest, if they so choose. Those w implants can look and feel balanced without pecs.

I started out using Jamie Eason's LiveFit trainer program - ran thru that twice back in 2010/2011 and learned a lot about how to structure a workout split.

I've found that at the amateur level it's perfectly fine to not be very precise with calorie counting. I just keep a rough running total in my head of the food that I've eaten so far that day and adjust accordingly. Getting more protein is more important than exceeding your daily call by 2 or 3 hundred imo."

I'm not sure if this is exactly what other people would say but to me recomp is losing fat while putting on muscle at the same time. Therefore your body ratio shifts. Bulking and cutting, you're only doing one at a time."

Brogress,2yhhyv,CapoeiristaAlpinista,3,Mon Mar 9 22:15:43 2015 UTC,"I'm roughly you're beginner stats, with your current strength haha. But what kills me is diet. Did you keep your diet pretty simple? My struggle is finding some meals that are relatively quick and easy that gets enough protein. So I guess my question is, what did your diet look like? Great results man!"
Brogress,2yhhyv,CapoeiristaAlpinista,3,Mon Mar 9 22:15:22 2015 UTC,"On my first cut it was a low carb with the carbs coming from nuts and veggies. A lot of chicken and almonds and veggies. I do not recomend a low carb. Bulking it was a lot of rice, red meat, some chicken. I got a little more lenient and started tearing up buffets, taking the gf out. I did IIFYM with about 70% typical 'clean' foods. Greek yogurt was a godsend on a bulk. This cut I get about 1850 calories and my macros are: protein 170, fats 50-66, carbs 120-170. I still eat chicken everyday. But my carbs come from yogurt, rice, sweet potatoes. It is cals in vs cals out. I will tell you what kept me going though. I love eating, so before my workout at noon I eat a quick carb source a banana or clif bar. Then after I drink a protein shake. I save 1250-1600 cals till 5 and eat all of it then. So it is like a bulk.  Any typos I am sorry I am on mobile."
Brogress,2yhhyv,turn30left,2,Mon Mar 9 22:24:46 2015 UTC,"No spelling problems man. I appreciate the response. So keep the foods really simple, and save the majority of your calories for the end of the day? Perfect man. Thank you."

Brogress,2yhhyv,bicyclefan,6,Tue Mar 10 20:30:46 2015 UTC,how the fuck can you benchpress 225lbs five times after 1 year of training?
Brogress,2yhhyv,tryfitnessdickin,8,Mon Mar 9 23:22:46 2015 UTC,That's not that unusual is it?
Brogress,2yhhyv,colaturka,4,Mon Mar 9 23:41:04 2015 UTC,There are many factors that go into it. It's safe to assume he simply worked hard. It's not that unattainable for 13 months. It's pretty much where he should be. I'm more impressed with his deadlift to be honest
Brogress,2yhhyv,tryfitnessdickin,1 point,Mon Mar 9 23:57:12 2015 UTC,Interesting. I've never benched on a regular basis but I can do 225 like 7 times. Pull ups on the other hand were really hard for me and seemed to take forever to be able to do a respectable amount.
Brogress,2yhhyv,qedb,1 point,Tue Mar 10 01:30:53 2015 UTC,I benched every other day for five months and got mine up to 265x4 in that time frame. It depends entirely on the person.
Brogress,2yhhyv,Buckeye1234,1 point,Tue Mar 10 00:34:35 2015 UTC,what rep scheme?
Brogress,2yhhyv,mgenson94,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:06:47 2015 UTC,"I do three sets of ten, starting with a weight I'm confident in, working to a weight I know I can only do 7-8 of without assistance or a break. So, for example, 185, 205, 225. I continue doing this, maybe bumping my start weight up if it's a good day, and go until I can compete all three sets without assistance. Then, my sets become 205, 225, 225. Repeat. Then 225, 225, 225. The last two are usually very short lived, but it's a progression that kept me going. After completing those, my next set would start with 225, 225, 245. Profit. (Side note, however, I also did decline and incline following the flat press, using the same idea.)"
Brogress,2yhhyv,ClarkDV,3,Wed Mar 11 14:54:31 2015 UTC,Icf 5x5 but I benched 3x a week. That took my bench from 155x5 to 210x5. Then I used Lyle McDonalds GBR the rest of the way. But starting out I could do 135x7.

Brogress,2yfxia,moosetrack,3,Mon Mar 9 15:15:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah no bother! For the majority of the 3 years where I was seriously lifting I had a:  Monday: Back & Bis  Wednesday: Chest & Tris  Friday: Shoulders & Arms  All exercises 3 x 8-10 reps  I didn't hit legs for a long time cause I play basketball and I can't play after hitting legs. I'd do some leg work on the off season but not nearly enough. These days I've stopped playing basketball for a while so I've changed up my split a small bit. I do Shoulders and arms at the weekends now and throw in a leg day at some point during the week. I've tendonitis in my knee so I'm taking it slow but my legs are alright already from cycling and bball.  With regards to eating I'm in college so its hard to eat properly. At the moment I'll just eat a big breakfast, two sandwiches and a Tupperware of chicken and pasta for college and then dinner when I get home. I'm too lazy to count calories so I just try to eat as much as I can while eating clean enough, although I won't deprive myself of a filthy kebab on a night out."

Brogress,2xvclu,Legal-Eagle,0,Wed Mar 4 14:32:17 2015 UTC,How many calories did you shoot for per day? Curious because i'm the same height. I eat about 4000/day and it has been a very slow weight gain.
Brogress,2xvclu,Cthulu2013,2,Wed Mar 4 13:20:05 2015 UTC,Anywhere from 3800-4500. I try to stay over 4k.

Brogress,2xpe0v,behringer__,18,Tue Mar 3 00:23:48 2015 UTC,"Training for a meet at the end of March. Hoping for 425 squat, 275 bench and 550 deadlift.  I train with a coach and powerlifting team, but the routine is something like this:   Monday: Heavy back squats, deadlift secondary (RDL at the moment) and leg accessories Wednesday: Heavy bench, overhead press/bench accessories, some light back work to balance out. Arm accessories. Friday: Heavy deadlift, squat secondary (front squat at the moment), back accessory work Saturday: Overhead press and pull-ups, bench secondary (floor press atm), arm work."
Brogress,2xpe0v,Unnamedwookie,3,Mon Mar 2 20:30:28 2015 UTC,Is that a mouthguard? Any reason (I mean I get the reason but anything specific?)

Between a mouthgard during heavy lifts and a night guard I'm hoping I can stave it off indefinitely (or until they have a better option than either stripping off the roof of your mouth or using cadaver gums)."
Brogress,2xpe0v,myufa1,2,Mon Mar 2 21:49:44 2015 UTC,I can tell you it's also probably because you're brushing too hard - I'm working with a few dentists right now on a force sensitive brush/i powerlift as well and this is a common thing.

Brogress,2xpe0v,bootleggedfirework,4,Mon Mar 2 22:54:55 2015 UTC,Why such a wide base? Not critical just wondering if it is helpful
Brogress,2xpe0v,Strapyy,11,Mon Mar 2 21:49:59 2015 UTC,"It's a modified sumo stance. True sumo would be even wider (search youtube for Dan Green deadlift).  The honest reason why we train that way at our gym is that it's more (and I hate using this word) functional than a traditional stance deadlift. There are a fair amount of people my coach guides that aren't competitive powerlifters, and the sumo stance is closer to the actual stance you'd take lifting up a box off the ground.  EDIT: In terms of it being helpful, I'd encourage everyone to try both and see what works best for them. Sumo was how I was taught and I was always stronger with it than a conventional stance."

Brogress,2xpe0v,autowikibot,7,Tue Mar 3 03:30:25 2015 UTC,"It's only dangerous if you lock your knees for too long and that ones down to cutting circulation. Locking any join should do no damage so long as it's within its intended range of motion. Think of yourself standing for long periods of time, you probably lock your knees for a little while and take turns ""unlocking"" then so let them rest."

Brogress,2xpdjw,tin_str,7,Tue Mar 3 12:46:46 2015 UTC,"I had made a post on brogress about a year ago.  It's been a year since then and a lot has changed. I got flamed in my original post for bragging about my   ""lean gains""   and arguing about not needing to lift heavy weights. Don't worry /brogress/thers i've seen the light. About 6 months ago I started lifting. I did the strong lifts program for 6 months straight.   During the course of that time I continued playing soccer. I was getting quite a bit of cardio every week, in the neighborhood of 3-5 hours.  I worked out every Mon/wed/fri:   Squat 5x5: I originally couldn't even get parallel with a sumo squat. I'm pretty tall and spend a lot of time sitting so my hip flexors were ridiculously tight. I have an elaborate stretching / warmup routine for everytime I squat. Eventually I loosened up and was able to go ass to grass. My biggest achievement was a bro in the gym who was squatting 360 lbs complemented me on my squat form.   Started 120 lb squat ---> Currently at 255 lb squat   Bench 5x5: Back in like 2012 I went to the gym on a split and basically fucked around. I didn't really have a proper routine and was doing hypertrophy. We benched every single day. So I have great form for benching. Problem is I don't have enough mass on my chest.    Started 120 lb bench ---> Currently at 165 lb bench   Bent Over Barbell Row 5x5: I struggled with this lift for the longest time. The form was extremely uncomfortable as I had poor flexibility and I'm tall as hell. I stuck with it for months but when the weight started getting high I had issues with my shoulder. My back is extremely tight, to the point when I would squat, near the end of my set it feels like my shoulder is going to pop out from having my arms back. I switched up from a bent over row to seated bench rows. My body has been much happier with me since.   Started at 65lb row ---> Got to 115 row  Switched to seated rows at 120lb ---> currently at 160lb seated row   Overhead Press 5x5: What a struggle. Holy shit. This one was brutal for me as I was so tight I could not raise my arms straight above my head and tuck my ears against my arms. I basically did this with terrible form for a while until I hurt myself. Luckily it wasn't too bad, but essentially I would move my arms up with the weight, and I would have a ""click"" in my left bicep. One of the PT's finally corrected my form and showed me some stuff to help out with my flexibility, but the exercise continued to fuck my shoulder so I switched to a machine overhead press. My buddy continued to barbell OHP and while he did that I would go do an elaborate stretch routine and then machine OHP with a hypertrophy set, 3x10-12.   Started Barbell OHP 75lbs ---> didn't get past 75lbs  Started Machine OHP 80lbs ---> Got to 140lbs machine OHP   Deadlift 5x5: Again as with some of the previous lifts, deadlift was a struggle for me. I didn't like crouching and bending over so much, but eventually a found a form that was comfortable. I continued this form for 6 months until a PT corrected me. Since this recent correction i've dropped my weight to fix my form, but i've steadily started climbing back up again. I now make sure to deadlift in my socks, and try my best to scrape my shins with the bar. I know with my body proportions I am built to deadlift like a boss, but I just need to get there first.   Started deadlift 145lbs ---> got to 230lbs  Fixed form restarted at 205lbs ---> currently at 225lbs  All of this lifting was while I continued to play for two soccer teams and play futsal. (soccer varient) I participated in a beep test (leger shuttle run) in January and was very proud to score 13, which in a class of 250 first year kines kids was the highest score. (2 other people tied my score.)  In January I got frustrated with my men's team and decided ""fuck it I'm going to bulk."" I kept up with it for approximately 1 month and actually managed to put on some weight. My main changes were the introduction of eggs whites and oats into my diet.   Since then I've rethought my goals and I care more about soccer than bulking. I am currently working on a new program that still has my big lifts in it, but also new stuff for my ""soccer performance.""  Diet  -I basically eat a big bowl of vector and have a couple cups of black coffee every morning. I try to have a second breakfast of oats if I can manage it.  -At lunch I will make my protein, (Musclepharm Combat) with skim milk and take my 4 fish oils and 1 multivit. I usually also make a sandwich with deli chicken and cheese.  -Dinner is a toss up, sometimes it's healthy sometimes it's not. Frequently I eat pizza, or burgers and fries, or lasagna. Linguine, tortellini, steak, and pork makes frequent appearances though.  -Throughout the day I intermittently take a swig of egg whites.   Sups  I take musclepharm 100% pure creatine with some sugar right before every workout and mens soccer game.  I take musclepharm 100% pure glutamine after every workout.  As mentioned before, Musclepharm combat protein powder, fish oils and a multivit.  Thanks for reading! Also below is basically an insight into my old fitness opinions.  Old album description (for the luls):   I was always decently active. I've played soccer almost my entire life. However I was never very health conscious or naturally built. I have a naturally very skinny body type. During the summer of 2013 I went for 5 km runs almost every single day in addition to playing soccer. By the end of the summer I had gotten down to 5% bf.  The lowest my weight ever got was 168 pounds. In September I started a new fitness regime. This was brought about for two reasons. 1. I was tired of being a toothpick. 2. I was concerned about keeping up my athleticism as winter came about.  I created a Google docs workout sheet to track my workouts. I can't be bothered to go to the gym because of money time and a gym partner so I knew I was stuck was at home workouts. The structure of my regime was as follows:   three workouts a week cardio every workout 3 or 4 different weight exercises    I did this workout sheet with my close friend who lives at the other end of the city. It worked out great because we could see each others workouts since it was a shared document. It really helped motivate and keep us accountable to each other.  Every few weeks I would switch in new exercises. I have limited equipment so most exercises were body weight or done with a basic set of dumbbells.   After we got into the swing of it we scaled up the number of exercises. Each workout would hit chest, abs, biceps and have a special focus depending on the week.  Using this system we cycled the workouts so we were never doing the same one for too long so our bodies would get used to it.  I've heard this maximizes gains. Now onto diet. I am naturally so god damn skinny I gave up all hopes of getting big. I can't be arsed to calorie count and eat like a whore for 6-8 months just to trick my body into putting on weight.  I decided I would stay lean and mean and my objective was to maintain 5% body fat while slowly gaining muscle.  I'm happy to say that after 6 months I've gone from 170 lbs to 175 lbs. Not a big weight difference but visually its huge."

Brogress,2xpytt,Mahkneesdontwork,2,Tue Mar 3 22:50:06 2015 UTC,"cross posting to /r/gainit   Not going to write shit loads, if there's something you want to know comment it and I'll answer it, going to keep it short.   Pictures : - I know the lighting isn't the same but I've moved out since the first pictures were taken and it was either lighting that really exaggerated everything, or pictures in the dark..  Before shots: http://imgur.com/a/0UXb1  After shots: https://imgur.com/a/dnY0u  Side by side: http://imgur.com/a/hj3DZ  Gonna go ahead and ask for criticism here, feel free to be brutal. What do I need to work more? I feel like my lats shoulders and chest look shit in comparison to my arms. What should I do next, carry on bulking or cut a little? I'm loving the progress I'm making and am inclined to carry on bulking but would love to hear what other people think.  I didn't take any before leg shots because I had never done a single set of leg exercises at that point. Legs still look weak as shit, if anyone really wants leg shots ask away but they're far from impressive.  Intro  I'm 19 y/o, 6 3, 190cm, have been going to the gym for about 4 years, very on/off. All together I will have racked up maybe 3 months consistent training. In those 4 years I didn't count my calories once for a full day, didn't have a proper regime, didn't lift with good form. With a proper diet and proper routine I could have made the same progress in about a months time.  I fucked my shoulder in my first few weeks when benching (either SLAP tear or a rotator cuff problem) which still causes me issues today, I have very mild pectus excavatum and my rib cage sticks out weirdly at the bottom (thanks mum for those last two).  I took these 6 weeks very seriously in terms of diet and training. GVT is a brutal routine and hurts like a bitch, the DOMS for the first 2 weeks were incredible too. Noob gains + GVT = gains.  Routine  I've been doing GVT for the last 6 weeks, today was my last day. My routine:  Day 1: Chest and back   Day 2: Legs and abs  Day 3: Rest  Day 4: Arms and shoulders  Day 5: Rest  Check out http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/luis13.htm for more information, explains it much better than I ever could. Google it, Youtube it etc.  My shoulder issue initially made it very hard to do chest and shoulders which is why I neglected these prior to starting this routine. A guy at my gym saw me wincing in pain while doing 22lbs dumbbell chest press and asked me what my issue was, he told me to pin my shoulder blades back and together for almost every upper body exercise I do. I've been doing this ever since and have had no issues whatsoever. Shoutout to the random guy at the gym.  If anyone wants specific exercises I did just ask.  I deadlifted a lot in the 4 years before so my lower back was fairly strong going into this, so I did very little lower back stuff and focused on traps and lats.   Diet  I'm yet another kid that always cried about how much he was eating and how fast his metabolism was so I went a bit crazy with my calorie goals. I was aiming to eat 7500 calories a day at the start, I managed to do this for about 2 weeks before realising how shitty it was making me feel. I then cut it down to 5500, sometimes I went over this but I made sure I never went under. In the 6 weeks I did not have a single day where I did not hit 5500 calories.   I did the GOMAD diet even though I know it's fairly controversial these days. I drank 4500ml whole milk a day which totalled to 2.9k calories. On top of this I ate a load of fried eggs, avocados, oats, peanuts, peanut butter, bread. I had a diet which was extremely high in fats and sugar and (relatively) extremely low in carbs. I know this isn't ideal but it worked great for me and was the only way I could eat so much.  Supplements  I have 5g creatine a day. I have a scoop of preworkout before I head out to the gym. I took BCAA's for the first week of training and then realised the stuff in the pills I had in my whey anyway so I stopped. I also had 60g 80% whey every day, and an extra 30g on days where I trained. I did not use any kinds of mass gainers.  tl;dr fucked around for 4 years, trained properly for 6 weeks and made more progress than in the last 4 years, GVT, GOMAD, 5500 calories a day min"
Brogress,2xpytt,aManPerson,4,Mon Mar 2 22:50:25 2015 UTC,did you count pretty strictly? 5500 seems a bit ridiculous to hit EVERY day and it would show a lot more than what you gained I think.
Brogress,2xpytt,aManPerson,1 point,Tue Mar 3 07:25:13 2015 UTC,"I counted very strictly, I was weighing out most of my meals. I do not think I had a single day where I went under 5500, but plenty where I went over."

Brogress,2xpytt,69inchesofgainz,2,Tue Mar 3 15:05:38 2015 UTC,"As far as I know every GVT routine is on on off on off? I think the volume part is more to do with time under tension in the actual workout, not how often you're hitting muscles, but I could be wrong.  I was not eating clean by any means, no baked chicken, no steamed veg, no brown rice. Most of my calories came from the milk I was drinking. On top of that I was eating a lot of peanuts and peanut butter, as well as fried eggs. This is how I made up most of my calories, the rest came from things like pasta and chicken, but max 800 calories from this. I wouldn't say I ate ""dirty"" because I didn't have fast food or anything like that, but I was far from clean."
Brogress,2xpytt,69inchesofgainz,1 point,Tue Mar 3 15:09:13 2015 UTC,"it's early, i'm tired, i might have gotten it mixed up.  ya i still thought the german and the norwegian high volume routines had you hitting the same group very very often.  whatever, it's working for you, so that's good.  i suppose i think ""dirty"" is just high glycemic eating.  cause we're not supposed to avoid fats.  the one good thing it sounds like, hopefully a decent amount of arachidonic acid.  supposedly it's an omega 6 fatty acid that helps PROMOTE inflammation in muscles, which leads to hypertrophy.  untrained people have higher amounts of arachidonic acid, while people who have been resistance training for quite some time have lower levels of it.    it doesn't seem SUPER 100% correct in saying more arachidonic acid will lead to more muslce growth.  great sources of it are animal proteins (that have fats in/with them)."

But i think you have to increase your calorie intake.  Start counting everything.  Macros calories even how much you lift.  Start progressive overloading.  Try looking into doing power days where you only focus on building strength so you can lift more when you do your hypertrophy.    But hey bro GOOD FUCKING PROGRESS.

Brogress,2xlrvw,jw-p,23,Sun Mar 1 22:23:54 2015 UTC,That is beyond impressive. How did you manage to pull this off!
Brogress,2xlrvw,TheUnfaithful,27,Sun Mar 1 22:54:27 2015 UTC,I had a pro body builder train me right from the very beginning. I've eaten clean this entire time except for a few cheat days. I box 3 times a week. I lift 5 times a week. I do cardio and abbs the days I don't lift. When I am lifting I'm in the gym for about 3 hours. I train super high volume. Lots of sets of lots of different lifts for the muscle group I train that day. It's not uncommon for me to do 40 - 50 sets in a workout! My diet has been 200 grams protein 180 grams carbs and 40 grams fat at about 2400 calories a day.
Brogress,2xlrvw,TheUnfaithful,11,Sun Mar 1 23:01:12 2015 UTC,Impressive stuff. That takes a lot of dedication to be able to do that every single day.

Brogress,2xlrvw,DAD_FISTER,0,Mon Mar 2 00:33:44 2015 UTC,Why are you at the gym for 3 hours? lol  That seems incredibly inefficient.
Brogress,2xlrvw,tony_randomredditter,7,Mon Mar 2 03:48:09 2015 UTC,15 - 20 minutes cardio to start off. 10 -15 stretching/ mobility work. 10-15 abbs. So about an hour right there after its all done. Then I go lift. I fuck shit up for the rest of the time. I never feel as if I'm tired in the gym. It's not hard for me to lose track of time and be there for 4 hours sometimes. I honestly love lifting. If I could make it my job I would. I'm happy in the gym. I love to see how hard I can push myself everytime!

Brogress,2xlrvw,swcurry30,4,Sun Mar 1 23:50:34 2015 UTC,No idea. Although heavy abb work helped out alot. Same with heavy oblique movements. But I quit those after it started to look like I had love handles again. They grew insanely fast and made me look weird. I'm not too worried about the lose skin though. I'm sure in another year of training I'll of filled out enough to not notice it.

I was on a walker for months, then crutches and a big brace. I was scared to jump, squat, pivot, take a knee. It was as much a physical obstacle to overcome as it was a psychological one. I kinda knew I was stronger than I thought, but I never tried for big weight and low reps. Once I started adding weight, I couldn't fucking believe how strong I was. Now, I'm not strong really, but I couldn't believe that I was capable of lifting these weights when in my head I was a cripple. 5/3/1 is the best part of my life, and now lifting is fun."

Bench Press - 115lbs to 265lbs max.  Deadlift - 105lbs to 385lbs max.  Squat - 95lbs to 330lbs max.   In September of 2011, I weighed 125lbs and was crippled by a motorcycle accident that took place a year prior. I walked with a limp and was told by multiple doctors that I could never participate in sports again.  I started lifting April 2012 with about 7 months clean. At my strongest (August 2014) I weighed 167lbs, and my combined big three weight went from 315lbs to 980lbs  Progress has been slow. Some of that was because of the old injuries, and some because up until Summer 2014, I was scared to get under heavy weight. When I started 5/3/1 my weights ramped up quick.  Lifting weights makes me happy, and there are few other things I get this excited about."

It might mess with your weightlifting a bit but this can be offse by having a little carbs before a workout. Anyways best of luck with everything

Brogress,2x1z1z,PM_ME_YOUR_TRADRACK,-1,Wed Feb 25 04:03:00 2015 UTC,Routine: Chest/Back Bis/Tris/Shoulders/Traps Legs/Abs  my diet is a dirty bulk but i am still conscious about not eating stuff thats too processed but I have a fair bit of cheap fast food. I always make sure to have lots of protein on a lift day and shakes after a lift.  I workout 5 times a week on average for the last 6 weeks. Before that I went through a noob gain phase and then lost my strength but not the weight after i stopped for a few months.

That was my last bulk focusing primarily on strength. I'm doing Oly Lifting and Crossfit right now, and I'm focusing on some weak points right now. Couldn't even tell you my numbers lol. My last squat day, I switched to high bar squats, and 275 for sets. I accidentally OHPed 155 the other day (I was working on jerks. I didn't lock out, so I got pissed and tried to press it. And it worked. My jerks though are more push jerks. I'm not quick enough under the bar, and haven't went heavy enough so that I can't press it).

Brogress,2x1z1z,CHooTZ,19,Wed Feb 25 03:17:03 2015 UTC,You're not 5-7%. I'd say ~10% is a more reasonable estimate. Here's a chart showing what the various stages look like.
Brogress,2x1z1z,Mr_CritiicaL,9,Wed Feb 25 18:02:02 2015 UTC,"Woah I agree, that's interesting I've never seen that. I'd say 8-10% then."
Brogress,2x1z1z,Mr_CritiicaL,1 point,Wed Feb 25 03:59:08 2015 UTC,"something about this seems slightly off; although I am not an expert in this area so I can't explain it from a textbook perspective; but what I do know is that back in college when I was running track/xc we all had our body fat tested and pretty much every single one of us fell between 4% and 8% but none of us were ripped like those guys. Of course, we were running between 70 and 120 miles a week; but my point is, I don't think body fat is directly related to the story those pictures tell. I think it is possible he has 5-7% body fat but he just doesn't have the growth of those muscles to make them as pronounced as they are in those pictures."
Brogress,2x1z1z,geo38,6,Wed Feb 25 05:23:01 2015 UTC,"While I doubt the chart is 100% accurate, what is even less accurate are almost all methods of bodyfat analysis short of an MRI. I doubt almost any of you were 4%. Most professional bodybuilders will only maintain 4% for a few days around competition. 8% is definitely reasonable for very lean runners, and 6% is probably the lower edge of bodyfat that you would see in people not specifically trying to get a low bodyfat percentage. I really don't think that it is possible that he is 5-7%. Not only that, but if you have more muscle mass, the same amount of fat will contribute to a lower relative perccentage. Therefore if he is less muscular, he will have an even higher bodyfat than someone with the same amount of fat and more muscle.  Just take a look at what 4% bodyfat looks like."
Brogress,2x1z1z,Nible,1 point,Wed Feb 25 05:26:24 2015 UTC,"It's possible you're right about 3% in most circumstances, but it definitely is possible to achieve 4% - though it means you have almost no fat whatsoever except that around your vital organs. It definitely isn't sustainable and generally bodybuilders can only maintain it for a few days around their competition.  Not to mention that since body fat percentage is inherently relative to your total mass (and vital organs don't grow with your size), if you have 400 lbs of total mass (it's possible, look at Hafthór Björnsson), the X pounds of fat it takes to keep your organs alive is going to be a much lower overall percentage of your overall mass than if you were 200 lbs."

Brogress,2wxfs1,GhostriderFlyBy,18,Tue Feb 24 06:01:25 2015 UTC,Some of the weight I've gained in the last year has undoubtedly been from puberty and because I was growing. But that doesn't mean my gains were only because of puberty. I've been working out 5 days a week for at least 6 of the last 12 months. I've also been trying my best to eat in excess and live a healthier lifestyle. Puberty can't be used as an excuse for gains but I acknowledge its presence and helpfulness.

Brogress,2wxfs1,AASresearch,14,Wed Feb 25 04:01:39 2015 UTC,"If you think gear is necessary to attain this physique, or to make this type of progress, you're mixed up, to say the least. Stay forever small, sweetheart."
Brogress,2wxfs1,Mr_Responsible,12,Wed Feb 25 03:59:50 2015 UTC,Proof? Some of that muscle gain is just due to his age as a growing teen
Brogress,2wxfs1,YoungMacDre,16,Tue Feb 24 16:13:37 2015 UTC,idk how i could provide proof but I think its pretty obvious that I did not use steroids. Yes a lot of the weight I gained was due to puberty and even height that I've gained in the last year. This physique is 100% attainable natural.
Brogress,2wxfs1,dreams_of_ants,8,Tue Feb 24 16:34:38 2015 UTC,I agree
Brogress,2wxfs1,phrakture,-24,Tue Feb 24 22:33:27 2015 UTC,Those delts too beautiful to be natty lite bra
Brogress,2wxfs1,Raminto,11,Tue Feb 24 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"If these delts are too nice to be naturally attainable, what the fuck kinda delts are you workin with, puddin?"
Brogress,2wxfs1,modernbenoni,2,Wed Feb 25 04:02:53 2015 UTC,If you got even a hint of delts then you are on gear obviously. Next year you're gonna have to cut off your arms to stay clear of steroid accusations from losers on the internet.
Brogress,2wxfs1,AASresearch,-20,Wed Feb 25 12:53:13 2015 UTC,"Puddin? Sweetheart? Why you acting sweet, faggot? What are u, OPs alt account?"
Brogress,2wxfs1,modernbenoni,10,Wed Feb 25 04:11:13 2015 UTC,"You seem upset, son. Please, do go on.    Edit: Saw that you're 5ft10in and 125lbs. I got it now. Sorry to pick on you. Shouldn't kick a fella when he's already down."
Brogress,2wxfs1,KhalmiNatty,6,Wed Feb 25 04:16:20 2015 UTC,"Not even close IMO. My delts grow faster than any other body part, but my bigger muscles such as chest and back struggle to add mass. He looks completely natural to me."
Brogress,2wxfs1,modernbenoni,15,Tue Feb 24 17:57:03 2015 UTC,"It is pretty obvious that he is completely natural. The kid has like 15 inch biceps with a pump and benches 215. I am not trying to discredit OP's work but if that isn't attainable naturally than we should just pack up our gym bags and fucking quit. This is only the beginning of OP's journey. It's a good example of how important genes are when it comes to bodybuilding. I am 17, have been lifting longer than OP, and am bigger and stronger than him in almost every way and I still do not look as good as him, it's simple genetics."
Brogress,2wxfs1,KhalmiNatty,4,Tue Feb 24 19:48:19 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, having visible abs == gear use now?"

Brogress,2wxfs1,PigDog4,11,Wed Feb 25 04:26:51 2015 UTC,Can you explain please? Are you implying he only rode a bicycle for that body?
Brogress,2wxfs1,flannel_smoothie,-6,Tue Feb 24 10:01:44 2015 UTC,"He's suggesting that OP ""cycled"" steroids.  Nothing wrong with that of course, but it perhaps shouldn't go unsaid as it gives others unrealistic expectations.  Edit: it's probably worth pointing out that most people agreed with this comment and /u/Avicenna1's comment until it was pointed out that he was a noob 6 months ago. Take from that what you will."
Brogress,2wxfs1,modernbenoni,8,Tue Feb 24 10:24:01 2015 UTC,"You're saying something stupid in a sensible tone to make it seem like you're not saying something stupid.  And, you're saying a stupid thing other idiots want to hear.  That gives people an unrealistic view of how much of an idiot you are.  Don't do that."

Brogress,2wxfs1,Raminto,-8,Wed Feb 25 04:00:51 2015 UTC,Wtf dude you just come in and call me dumb without actually saying what part of my comment is dumb? You're a rude person.
Brogress,2wxfs1,PigDog4,6,Wed Feb 25 07:59:15 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with that of course, but it perhaps shouldn't go unsaid as it gives others unrealistic expectations.   Hi! Let me explain to you why you're an idiot. You were ""nicely"" implying that this guy is on steroids. You have no proof at all that and yet you're blindly accusing him of it because he made good progress in a year. You can't just throw your hands up in the air and proclaim steroids just because someone made better progress than you have."
Brogress,2wxfs1,Mr_Strangelove_MSc,-9,Wed Feb 25 11:59:31 2015 UTC,"I wasn't being nice about it, I was being neutral about it. Yes I was implying that he is on steroids because I, like many other people in this thread, think that he's on steroids. His body is achievable natty but for such a short time frame without much attention to nutrition this is a very uncommon case, so for most people to take their expectations of their potential natty progress from this it would give them unrealistic expectations.  Dem delts with dem lifts just don't add up."
Brogress,2wxfs1,SwagaliciousHobo,7,Wed Feb 25 12:04:42 2015 UTC,"Dude was going through puberty and lifting. Is puberty considered running a test cycle these days? Literally no male is natty, then.  Why does it ""need to be said""? You need to say it to make your own mediocre lifts feel better? To encourage other newbies that their mediocre progress is ok?   ""Hey, there new friends! No matter what happens, you're still lapping everyone on the couch! Who cares if you can only deadlift 185 after a year of inconsistent training and that's not even your bodyweight!""  Some people have better genetics. Some people have a harder work ethic than you. Life isn't fair, but it's certainly not going to get more fair by blindly accusing people of steroids."
Brogress,2wxfs1,imonthelisttoo,-5,Wed Feb 25 12:17:49 2015 UTC,Lol stop putting words in my mouth. Literally every one of your points is just assuming that I think things which I do not think at all. Is that all you got?
Brogress,2wxfs1,PigDog4,1 point,Wed Feb 25 12:49:38 2015 UTC,"So why would feel the need to call out OP on steroids if you're happy with your progress and your physique and your lifts?  The kid put on 25 lbs in his first fucking year of lifting. That's 0.5 lbs per week. That's like, literally the number that gets thrown around as a good amount of muscle as a natty lifter.  KhalmiNatty is suggesting that you are stupid.  Nothing wrong with that of course, but it perhaps shouldn't go unsaid as it gives others unrealistic expectations of your intelligence."
Brogress,2wxfs1,modernbenoni,4,Wed Feb 25 16:13:34 2015 UTC,All of it.
Brogress,2wxfs1,GhostriderFlyBy,-6,Wed Feb 25 11:56:36 2015 UTC,So /u/Avicenna1 wasn't suggesting that OP is on steroids?

Brogress,2wxfs1,Bushybushings,1 point,Tue Feb 24 16:39:08 2015 UTC,"is that frowned upon? Sorry I'm new at all this stuff, but is there some hate on creatine?"
Brogress,2wxfs1,MEatRHIT,12,Tue Feb 24 19:28:17 2015 UTC,"These people are subtly (and not so subtly) accusing OP of using steroids.  Since you're new to this, I'll give you a quick rundown on how online progress pics work:  1) Is the poster bigger, leaner, and stronger than me? He's clearly on so many steroids he's going to die at any second.  2) Is the poster smaller and stronger than me? He's clearly on so many steroids that he's going to die any second.  3) Is the poster smaller and weaker than me? Lol dude are you even fucking trying? Get on a beginner program and eat a billion calories per day.  4) Is the poster about my size and strength levels? Start tearing him down about how he took too long to get there. Unless he's been working out for less time than me, then he's definitely on steroids.  I hope this is helpful for you."
Brogress,2wxfs1,PigDog4,5,Wed Feb 25 05:45:47 2015 UTC,"No, creatine is fine and a lot of people take it. It's precisely an ironic joke."

Brogress,2wxfs1,Zephyr4813,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:32:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP.  Also, the fact that you're accusing OP of juice probably means you're far too small to ever be accused of roiding."

This sub is very pro steroids so me trying to shame him for juice would never work.

Usually 15/12/8/6 reps with increasing weights until I'm nearing failure on the final set.  Chest:  Barbell bench  Cable flies  Incline bench  Dips  Shoulders:  Overhead press  Shugs  Lateral raises  Front raises  Reverse cable flies to hit the rear delts  Back:  Deadlifts, depending on how my lower back is feeling  Bent over row  45 degree row with the trx  Cable rows  Pull-ups to failure  Legs:  Squat  Leg extension   Leg curl  Lunges  Calf raises, 6 sets to failure  Bonus video of my first couple of muscle ups"

Honestly I would up the cals quite a bit, you could put on 15 more pounds by the 24 month mark.

After being tired of looking at myself every morning and not being happy I took the plunge, and after months and months I started to see results and truly fell in love. Now I'm so passionate about bodybuilding, I couldn't imagine my life w/o it.  Those other two albums should cover quite a bit, I'd be happy to answer any questions.

But I woke up and consumed my first meal of the day around 5am (usually eggs, turkey bacon, grits, and an apple) I typically sipped on my BCAAS (1half gallon) for my drink. My work started at 6am so I would sip on the way to work and take my supplements (one a day multi, fish oils, vitamin C, beef Aminos, dessicated liver, and vitamin B-Complex) at 8 I'll have my second meal, typically beef or chicken, potatoes, and a green vegetable of a sort. At 10 I have my first snack I'd take 2 scoops of weight gainer and mix in a half a cup of ground up oats and take more beef Amino's and livers. At 12 I take my third meal lunch break and repeat meal 2. Then at 2 I would have my preworkout (no stimulants in it) mixed with Waximaize for a carb source then hit the gym and sip on my second half gallon of BCAAS. (I typically finished this before the workout was over) fresh after I would have a scoop of whey and 2tbs of hot Coco (for a sugar spike) and creatine mixed in it and slug it down on the drive home. I then would have beef, tacos, homemade pizza w/e and more greens as meal 4. I then before bed would take zma, my amino pills. As my before bed snack I would mix 6 TBS of cocwheats into my 2 scoops of whey and slug it down then nap it out.  --My lifting split was Sun: Legs, Mon: Chest & calf, Tues: arms, Wed: Rest day (or abs), Thurs: Back, Fri: Delts & Traps, and Sat: Work on weak areas day or rest day.

Brogress,2wtkxe,thetravelers,13,Mon Feb 23 15:16:09 2015 UTC,The dedication is evident in the gains - nice work man.  Are you considering to maintain the diet and supplement intake? Has it been pricey or have you found any cheap sources?
Brogress,2wtkxe,BallinDalin,4,Mon Feb 23 03:08:17 2015 UTC,Its dang pricey but I found that the amino pills are not THAT bad. They seem like they are but for a container of 500 (133) servings its like 36 bucks. Bcaas get the cheapest u can find with a 2:1:1 split and protein don't worry About isolate thats good stuff but damn pricey just get the proteins.

Which supplements, what do they do, where can I buy them (amazon is best for us overseas folks) , and where I can learn more? I'm assuming I can learn more on this sub-reddit?

Training days have me eating a large amount of carbs (300-400g) with a small amount of fats (30-50g) at a 20% surplus. On rest days I go for a maximum of 50g of carbs and fill the rest with fats to encourage fat burning and to make sure when I eat a lot of carbs on the next training day most of it goes to my muscles as glycogen, all with a 10% deficit of my TDEE. Protein stays at 200g on both training and rest days.  I started out with a +30/-10 percent split for my calories but found I was gaining weight too fast and so i brought it back so I'm gaining 0.5-1lb a week.  As to what I actually eat. For carbs I eat a lot of oats, pasta, rice and potatoes as well as wholemeal bread on occasion. For fats I like to eat peanut butter, avocados, untrimmed meats, cooking with olive oil and taking fish oil supplements. And for protein I eat a lot of eggs, meat, oats, pasta (which has a surprising amount of protein if you buy the right kind), cottage cheese, whey protein powder and 1% milk. Those are my staples, I try to avoid junk food but when I'm bulking I do allow myself more occasions to eat them than when I'm cutting"

Brogress,2wli58,Epic_BBQ,2,Fri Feb 20 23:58:36 2015 UTC,I really appreciate that! I don't really have one set diet I just try to eat as clean as I can. My breakfast is always the same though two packs of oatmeal with 3 large eggs and a pb&j. I try to eat as much chicken and rice as I can but it doesn't always work out. I do drink nitrotech with milk at least once a day and if I'm missing a meal I'll drink two.

Brogress,2wjc5c,penotti,9,Fri Feb 20 11:04:12 2015 UTC,"I know the lighting and positioning is different in the pics, but my back definition has jumped up quite a bit in the last few months.

Brogress,2wjc5c,coffeecupschooner,6,Fri Feb 20 12:37:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Broke my right collarbone last month of 2013, and exactly 4 months later broke my right hand.  My diet has been very consistent:   2400 calories a day, macros all split up in the 30-35% range.  Link to MFP here.  Back ground: I do both crossfit and powerlifting (with some bodybuilding routines thrown in)  Workout routine was a challenge, since for the first third of the year upper body was quite hard because of the collarbone. Followed a P/P/L routine and did a lot of recovery work for my right side.  Then by the end of March, broke my right hand and this made it again hard for upper body, so my focus switched more to legs. I would pretty much train legs about 3-4 times a week and tried adding in other body parts if my hand permitted. Also followed a few short Smolov cycles in April and Wendler 5/3/1 in May/June/July/Aug/Sep.  Before this story becomes too long and boring, I think the biggest help to improve my strength again were:   Barbell rows Strict pull-ups Strict ring dips   I attribute Wendler for making a lot of gains, although in the end it would stress me out too much, so currently following a different program that has already made me set 4 new PR's in 1,5 months.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask!"

Brogress,2w38ym,fluffymug,2,Tue Feb 17 10:33:35 2015 UTC,"This is very impressive work. What you did in 9 months takes lots of people years to accomplish. I read in your xpost to /r/fitness that your calories were down to around 1200. You got results, but I hope you plan on increasing that. Going too low can lead to some muscle wasting. It also says that you're bringing up your calories while counting your macros, so it seems like you know this. I just want to help you avoid the frustration.  I'd really like to know what this tracking system is all about. There appear to be different colors, and certain days have circles around them. Please let me know what is going on here. Also, I really wish you had some bloodwork done for your before and after. I'd love to know what the diet and exercise (mostly HIIT?) has done to your hormones.  Something else I want to mention here. I really thought you were going to have some signs of gyno in your after pics. I am very happy for you that you don't. You seem to have minimal loose skin. You did a pretty quick transformation and you didn't have the side-effects. I know a few people that avoid losing weight because they're conscious of the loose skin. I wonder what helped you avoid that. Typically, people add muscle to deal with the loose skin, but you don't appear much bigger.  This is very impressive. What is your plan to put on muscle? I would recommend lifting weights, but you said you work out at home and I don't know what exercises you can do."

Brogress,2vtgpg,Stamcia,9,Sat Feb 14 09:51:34 2015 UTC,"Background: Lifted on/off since 15, mainly focused on chest and arms, never cared about diet. At the start of my cut on 8th Sept 2014, I had been away from the gym for 2 months, my 5rms up till then were : Bench/Squat/Deadlift: 176lbs/265lb/never.    Day 1-75 8th Sept 2014 194-172lbs, 26-15% bf: I read and decide to start following /r/leangains protocol effective immediately.    Lifting routine: 3 days a week, M/W/F:Back/Legs/Chest split using Reverse Pyramid Training protocol, involves doing 2 sets per exercise, the 1st set to failure at 8-12 reps and the 2nd and last set with 90% the weight of the first set +1 rep. Monday: Assisted Pullups 6 reps Barbell Rows 8x88lbs OHP 8x88lbs Closegrip Chinups 1rep Deadlift 200lb  Wed: Squats 5x200lbs Hamstring machine Calves Glute thrusts 8x160lbs    Fri: Bench Press 8x154lbs Incline dumbbell press 8x44lbs Iso bicep curls 8x22lbs Tricep extensions 8x22lbs    DIET As per leangains protocol, I had a feeding window from 12pm-8pm, I did not eat outside of these hours. For the first 9 weeks, I straight up hit a 7000kcal weekly deficit. My estimated TDEE was around 2400, so I had 1200/1700kcals on rest/lifting days, it was hard in the beginning but my lifts did not stall till week 6. My Rest/Lifting day Protein/Carb/Fat split was roughly 180/50/remainder:200/150/remainder My priorities for dieting were: 1)Meet Protein goal 2)Stay under calorie goal  3)Stay low carb on rest days/high carb on workout days    Day 75-101 17 Nov 2014, 171-166lbs, 15-11%bf After 75 days of hard dieting I decided to slow down my cut as my stalling bench press at 175lbs x 5 was annoying me. Also exam stress was getting to me and I decided to lift more to release stress. I started going everyday except Wednesdays and Sundays, still kept the same body part rotation though.    Diet: I kept the number of high carb days the same (M/Tues/F) even though I had more lifting days (5). I aimed for a lower weekly deficit of 5500kcals, my kcal intake was raised to 1400/1950kcals on low/high carb days, my dieting priorities did not change. Naturally with the increased calories, my pulls started increasing: by mid December I was doing 10 pullups compared to resorting to assisted pullups when I was starting out.      Day 101-120 17th December - 5th Jan 2015 166lbs-169lbs 11-12% BF  I spent the holidays with my local Uni friends' families, tried to do some pushups and eyeballed what I ate, but did not really track. Gained 3 pounds and 1% body fat.    Day 121-159 6th Jan-13th Feb 2015 169lbs- 165lbs 12-10% BF I decided to go for a very mild 3500kcal weekly deficit, my TDEE increased substantially during this period as I started training on the ICU (2800kcal). I stop doing squats and deadlifts after I feel an intense pressure in my inguinal ring on the 3rd week of January. I stop RPT protocol and move towards PPL (without legs really). Due to hectic workdays I now do Push days on Sat and Tues and Pull days on Sun and Wed. I also incorporate an hour of LISS cardio on both Sat and Sun, previously I was doing zero cardio. I also start counting in KG.  Lifting Push: Bench Press 3x80kg 7x72.5kg 5x72.5kg 9x66.5kg 8x66.5kg Incline Dumbbell Press 3x10x22kg 9x22kg 11x20kg Cable Crossover 10x32kg 9x32kg  10x27kg  8x27kg  10x25kg Landmine Press 4x12x20kg Cable Crunches: 3x15x59kg    Pull Up(BW): 12,8,7,6 BB Row: 5x10x55kg Kroc Rows: 5x12x22kg Cable Rows: 5x15x91kg CG Chinups to failure    Notes/Learning points: 1) Diet is boss, I could've done pushups at home all day and I believe I'd have looked 90% similar, seriously, watch your diet, so SO much more important than lifting when you're cutting. 2) I'm a dirty leg-day skipping whore. But I don't want to get a hernia. 3) The first 75 days I ate really clean, and then progressively less clean. I think it makes a difference, but then I changed to many variables to make a proper inference. 4) I did not intentionally add cardio on my heavy lifting weekends; ICU is tiring, physically and psychologically, I had to wake up at 6am and got home at 6pm and then had to study for the next day. Some people who seemed really well and I got close to passed away unexpectedly. I needed something to clear my mind.    THE FUTURE Well, continue my Push/Pull, aiming for a slow bulk at 2700/3000 per day, add in leg day when the pressure goes away.    Any questions just fire away, I generally try to answer to the best of my ability!  Back Progress: http://imgur.com/a/9fGxW Front Progress: http://imgur.com/a/Tae9Z"
Brogress,2vtgpg,Noissim,6,Fri Feb 13 23:15:59 2015 UTC,"Definitely keep with your plans to bulk. While you absolutely did a great job of cutting off that excess fat to look shredded, I feel like you're lacking in size, IMO.   I'm about 6'3"" and have been hovering around 205 for the past few months. Even at that weight I feel like a string bean, I couldn't imagine losing 40lbs of mass.   Also, I'm sorry about the whole hernia/missing leg day thing, that seriously sucks.  Judging by your success with your cut, I'm sure you'll do well with your bulk. Keep up the hard work brah, we're all gonna make it someday."
Brogress,2vtgpg,Noissim,4,Sat Feb 14 00:56:13 2015 UTC,"Cheers mate appreciate the props! Yeah this is the smallest I'm ever gonna be. I started off with a cut instead of a bulk like almost everyone suggested because I felt the discipline learnt during a cut would be invaluable.   Also, the leaner I cut to, the longer I would get to bulk for without getting fat."
Brogress,2vtgpg,Vapo,2,Sat Feb 14 01:00:46 2015 UTC,"You're right with that man, cutting takes quite a bit of self control as I'm sure you've learned.  I don't think I've weighed under 175 since grade 8, but then again, I also stopped gaining height in grade 8.  Maybe see a doctor about your abdominal pain, so they could either a) help you b)tell you how to fix it c)charge you a co-pay to have them tell you there is nothing they can do? Better to be safe than sorry. I worry that skipping leg day too much might overdevelop your upper body."

Are you depressed, frustrated, or just desiring adoration?   The last one is easiest to deal with: just find some way to attain value & get it (for yourself).   The second requires a bit of introspection to locate the cause of frustration, and then courage to take action.  The first - genuine depression - is the most challenging, and best worked out with a therapist that you can honestly, honestly, trust."

Brogress,2viozm,Zephyr4813,1 point,Wed Feb 11 11:59:56 2015 UTC,i did not use any guides i just talked alot with my sister fiance who is pretty buff. But there are some pretty good guides on bodybuilding.com
Brogress,2viozm,reddituser00000,8,Thu Mar 5 11:21:40 2015 UTC,Do you have a before pic?
Brogress,2viozm,IntellegentIdiot,12,Thu Mar 5 21:13:28 2015 UTC,Well he gained 26 pounds and is still very lean so you can imagine his death camp physique.
Brogress,2viozm,Zephyr4813,7,Wed Feb 11 14:41:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's just not really ""progress"" if there's only one side of the equation. It would be like someone posting a picture of a bad physique, and saying, ""this was me when I was out of shape, but I'm jacked now!"" Doesn't really have much impact."
Brogress,2viozm,reddituser00000,2,Wed Feb 11 20:21:32 2015 UTC,Right. This is Brogress not here's what I look like now.
Brogress,2viozm,TheBurningSoda,1 point,Wed Feb 11 20:26:30 2015 UTC,I agree it doesn't have the same impact. Just pointing out my observation.

Brogress,2viozm,CavalierHawks,2,Wed Feb 11 15:20:46 2015 UTC,thank you :)
Brogress,2viozm,CavalierHawks,2,Wed Feb 11 12:41:06 2015 UTC,Hey man don't put yourself down like that. You've exhibited an ability to commit to hard work and dedicate yourself!
Brogress,2viozm,CavalierHawks,2,Wed Feb 11 12:43:30 2015 UTC,Thank you ! :) you just made my day alot better
Brogress,2viozm,broseph-here,2,Wed Feb 11 15:43:26 2015 UTC,"Good job bro! I wish I started when you did. I am 25 and just started last year as skinny fat. When I was your age I was the same body type, super lean. I was 130 when i started at 5'7 and am now at 155 almost a year later. Still kept my top abs, but I'm going to cut back down for the summer and see the results. I look a lot bigger than I am so I try not to go by the scale too much as 155 seems small to me still after a year of lifting and 14% bf. My joints and bones are smaller so I know that takes away from the weight compared to others. My wrist is 6.2in for example.   Keep going man. I would start a lean bulk if I was you and lean bulk all the way through next year. Your frame can hold some more fat and still be lean. I'd make the plunge to 155-160 over the next year and see how you feel."
Brogress,2viozm,beefyliltank,1 point,Wed Feb 11 15:51:08 2015 UTC,thanks alot for the advice! 155lbs is my current goal and im trying to start lean bulking. :) thanks for your comment

Brogress,2v8o2s,Hoffytown,9,Mon Feb 9 03:59:42 2015 UTC,"Year 1 I just did cardio and ate well. Year 2 I started lifting (~11 months ago). I started off with bro splits, then blaha's program, back to bro splits, and finally settled with P/P/L (pull push legs instead of push pull legs) which goes P P L P P L rest, repeat.    EDIT: Not sure if this is sufficient information or if anyone wants more. Feel free to reply to this comment for any other info. If anyone cares about lift #s here are the 3 big ones: Note: These are all 3 sets of 5. I don't test my 1 rep max.

Brogress,2v51ms,MASSIVIST,19,Sat Feb 7 23:39:48 2015 UTC,Dafuq? How did you do that in 9 months??
Brogress,2v51ms,GrannySmithMachine,11,Sun Feb 8 00:50:44 2015 UTC,"I've been playing sports for most of my life and my body was quite receptive to strength training.  I have a bad lower back + hamstrings and could barely do an 80lb deadlift when I started. I just kept upping the weight every week and worked out through the pain. Now I'm using a belt and making sure not to round my back.  I reached 315 on my squat, then realized I wasn't even going down to parallel. So I started that from scratch about a month ago and now I'm going ass-to-grass at 225, parallel at 275. My bench is also at 225 with proper form.  I neglected my diet for far too long though... hit a wall in Oct. and my progress stopped.  Started eating way more carbs/fat/protein and progress continued. I'm not a big eater so I had to force myself to get up early and make an actual breakfast. I make protien shakes with meal supplements (boost etc) to get extra fat/protien/calories."
Brogress,2v51ms,colmusstard,4,Sun Feb 8 01:20:56 2015 UTC,"8 months to go from 80lb DL to 455lb DL? Thats adding more than 10lb a week consistently for 8 months without getting fat? I've never seen progress like that before, which makes me question it a bit..."
Brogress,2v51ms,fluffstravels,1 point,Mon Feb 9 01:23:10 2015 UTC,10 months. Started with fixed barbells in early May (didn't track those) and moved to actual barbell in late May. Here are my PRs. I got stuck on 375 from Aug to Dec. Was sick for almost two months (Sept + Oct) with a lingering lung infection and almost didn't go to the gym at all.  Started making progress again when I started eating better and doing more squats to strengthen my legs.
Brogress,2v51ms,Shepard27,1 point,Mon Feb 9 03:21:18 2015 UTC,I was told not to use a belt because it prevents you from building strength in your lower back. Maybe there's debate on this?
Brogress,2v51ms,Aquipy,3,Sun Feb 8 16:03:24 2015 UTC,I use the belt to stabilize my core and keep parts in their place. I hurt my lower ribs/back early on as things were shifting/moving around. I definitely 'feel' stronger when I'm wearing one... not sure how it would keep me from building strength as I'm still flexing the muscles. Some info here.

Brogress,2v51ms,GrandAce,3,Sun Feb 8 00:57:18 2015 UTC,Can you tell us more about Tough Mudder? I looked at the website and this looks really interesting. I've decided to start training for it.  Do you have to form your own team?
Brogress,2v51ms,GrandAce,5,Sun Feb 8 00:37:52 2015 UTC,"I knew nothing about it, only that I wanted to do it... just bought a ticket online and showed up by myself.  I had no trouble with the obstacles... the distance running was the hardest part. There wasn't enough water stops along the way, and I didn't eat enough before the run.  Lots of people on the sidelines with cramped calves towards the end. I started cramping up too, but I slowed my pace considerably (although your time isn't measured, I was going for speed).  Didn't eat or drink enough after as well (derp) and my legs were sore for the rest of the week.  Will try it again this year with a camelback of some sort and proper shoes."
Brogress,2v51ms,sipoloco,2,Sun Feb 8 01:03:46 2015 UTC,"I've done it two years in a row now, it'll be three this summer. The obstacles are pretty easy so long as you're in decent shape. The running is the toughest part, especially since your clothes will be heavy with mud/water and there will be sand and stuff in your shoes. I'm by no means a super awesome athlete and my friend and I did the course this past summer in 2 hours and 10 minutes. Not terribly fast but pretty good for our skill level.  You can go by yourself no problem, for a few obstacles you'll be helping each other out anyways. Everyone's pretty cool with helping each other.  And the electroshock stuff doesn't hurt as bad as they advertise.  I would recommend doing it at least once and trying it out, plus it's good motivation to train hard.  The beer at the end is pretty damn tasty, too."

Brogress,2v51ms,AASresearch,2,Sun Feb 8 13:03:14 2015 UTC,"Yep! I preferred a wider grip because it felt like it was pulling less on my left shoulder, which has some scar tissue inside. My grip is much closer now and my toes are pointed slightly out."

Brogress,2uxz47,sharmalarm,1 point,Fri Feb 6 22:25:47 2015 UTC,I am currently somewhere between your first and second pictures. I do a slightly modified ICF. Can you talk a little about your decision to start bulking?
Brogress,2uxz47,sharmalarm,2,Sat Feb 7 00:34:05 2015 UTC,"Well, one thing came clear once i started reading /r/bodybuilding or /r/bulkorcut, why would i cut if i dont have any foundation. It was quite clear that i had to start bulking so i could build muscle, but sometimes i had these thoughts like ""I know i have no muscle but i have too much fat"" so i didnt know what to really do. After researching i knew i had to decide between one or the other cause being in the middle was a bad decision. So, what i did was just imagine the body i wanted to achieve and in order to transform into it i had to gain a lot of muscle, the fat afterwards with a good cut will be burned and if you are pacient and dedicated enough you wont lose much muscle. The only thing that i would recommend you is to set a goal and dont hesitate until you achieve it, this takes time and your body will show you if you are doing things right or not."
Brogress,2uxz47,AASresearch,1 point,Sat Feb 7 02:41:35 2015 UTC,"Great answer, thanks man. I'm going to bulk.   I am making some solid newb gains while cutting but not nearly what I'd like to be. I guess its possible to take advantage of the newb gains by bulking as well, that way I can size up and burn a bit of fat as well."

Lunchs are fast food more often than not - McD, Arby's, Subway, etc. On this bulk I've eaten far too much of it to be honest (Don't know how many Quarter Pounders meals with lage fries and two McDoubles I've had ugh). Lately I've been making chilis for lunch (lots of beans, beef or chicken, chopped carrots, celery, tomato). Dinners though are usually home cooked. A meat, veggie, and rice or noodle.

I did 20 minutes of variation cardio after each workout. so I worked out everything twice a week.

Brogress,2ukktf,in_cognito,2,Tue Feb 3 00:53:15 2015 UTC,"It came in a little, more than I thought it would but it's still there, won't be rocking a 6 pack any time soon. I have actually lost more fat from previous pics but you cant see it because of the skin and I think that's stopping any visible progress in the past months comparisons. I am stronger, can work out longer and can feel clothes from a few months ago are even more loose fitting now, but since the skin kinda stays out then you can't see the fat loss/cutting working.  Think I'll leave it quite a while before any more updates, didn't realise there was such a small visible different from previous photos till I saw them together."
Brogress,2ukktf,ButExercisingIsHard,6,Tue Feb 3 07:51:20 2015 UTC,"Mind if I ask the differences between the past five months  ? No doubt you look good but I'm not seeing too much of a difference, maybe there is in strength or something I'm not seeing? Still great job  Edit: Not sure why I'm being down voted for pointing out that five months ago AND two months ago he posted his pics here, and now again with no change in the final picture."
Brogress,2ukktf,DirtyMuneca,2,Mon Feb 2 23:46:24 2015 UTC,Delts and chest maybe. I really don't see five months of progress though.
Brogress,2ukktf,gamesandtheory,2,Tue Feb 3 04:47:01 2015 UTC,"Delts, lats and chest are up, waist has come in quite a bit but yeah hard to see the change from those photos seeing them together, I genuinely think it's the skin as I feel a big difference even though now its obviouse that there visibly isnt much... will leave it quite a while before any more progress pics. Not sure why you're being downvoted either, obvious to see really when going from one to the other."
Brogress,2ukktf,geierseier,1 point,Tue Feb 3 07:22:00 2015 UTC,there's a difference in your ab region too..you can start to make out the the outline of abs in your most recent pic... beast..keep it up

Brogress,2ukktf,P0ckSuppet,1 point,Tue Feb 3 18:19:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I've not done any bulking, it's more or less been all low carb since the beginning. In fact its only since seeing how little progress I've made that I'm deciding to bulk properly for a couple months then cut before summer."

Brogress,2uftlv,Orangedeww21,5,Mon Feb 2 00:11:37 2015 UTC,"For anyone wondering, here is the last 9 months I bulked on 250g carbs and 150g protein and 60g fat. I slowly upped my calories from 2000 to like 3000-ish across 6 weeks and then just maintained that for about 6 months.  My routine was pretty much the same routine I'm running now except it was 5 sets of 15 reps. I used a lot of intra-carbs (for the pump) and postworkout carbs(for the gains). I literally just ate and ate and ate  Workout was this  5 day split  chest/tris Back/bis Shoulders hams and glutes Suads  .  chest - incline barbell, incline DB, cable crossover, dumbbell flyes, dips, overhead dp extentions  .  back - cable row, lat pull down, vgrip pull down, this arm push down thing on the cable machine, a fuck tone of curls, DB curls, barbell curls, cable curls  .  shoulders - DB lat raises, db side lat raises, ohp, front cable raises, barbell press  .  hams - deadlifts, romainain deadlifgts., GHR's. leg curls, a fucking tone of leg curls, kick backs, barbell bridge things  .  quad days, squats, front squats, OH squats, lunbges, leg press, leg extentions, calve raises  . . . . .  Cutting was basically this Stage 1- Switching from bulk to maintenance. I finished on around 2500 calories to 2200, 30P,40C, 30F (in %). This diet switch alone dropped a few KG's  Stage 2- A 6 week transition from maintenance to a 200 calorie deficit. I dropped my calories very slowly - around 50 calories a week, sometimes every other week while monitoring the scales. The aim was to keep my intake as high as possible while maintaining steady fat loss  Stage 3 - I was now at 2000 calories per day, I switched to 40P, 30C and 30F. Still zero cardio by this point. Calories stayed at 2000 I just swapped macros around - I was dropping more KG's  stage 4 - Dropped my calories to 1800 - Switched from percentages to a minimum 200g protein intake and then adjusted my carbs and fats based on what calories were left  Stage 5 - I'm currently running on 1750 with a minimum of 200g protein per day. I've added in 1 high carb day(280g) and 2 low carb days (50G). I'm currently losing weight at about 2lbs per week.  Next stage is to ramp up the cardio  Workout is a 5 day split Monday - Back and bis, Tuesday - Quads and Calves Wednesday - Shoulders Thursday - Rest Friday - Chest and tri Saturday - Hamstrings, Glutus-bootyious and calves Sunday - rest  I added in 10 minutes of sprints post workout which is 2 minutes warm up, 9kmph sprint, 1 minute walking, 10km sprint 90 second sprint, 1 minute walk, 11km, walk, 12, walk, 13km, walk, repeat until 10 minutes is done then 2 minutes walk to cool down"

Unfortunately, I had an accident a few months ago and was not able to bulk during the off season as I had planned. Since I wasn't able to make much brogress (only gained like 2~3 lbs compared to end of the season weight), I figure I'd post pictures that shows how much of a difference lighting can make.  Lifting Stats:   I have not done traditional lifting for almost 2 and a half years due to degenerated disc. On top of that, my shoulder ligament is torn from the recent accident so I can't even bench press nowadays.  Prior to the accident, my routines were something like  Mon, Wed, Fri: ""Bigger"" Muscle 30~40 min.  -Chest (Choice of 2, 4 sets of 8~10 reps): Bench, Inclined Bench, Dumbbell Press, Inclined Press  -Back: Pull-ups and Back Raises  -Legs (Choice of 1- or 2 sometimes): Pistol Squats, Dumbbell Lunge, Squad (Occasionally when my back can handle), dumbbell step up  Tu, Th: ""Smaller"" Muscle 25 ~ 30 min  -Tricep (Choice of 2): Scull Press, Pushdown, One-arm tricep extension, Cable incline tricep extension  -Bicep (Choice of 2): Curl Variations  -Shoulder (Choice of 2): Hand Stand Push-ups w/ wall assist, Dumbell Press, Barbell Press, Lat raise  *I take little to no rest in between sets so the whole routine works kind of like supersets.  Nowadays I do whatever I can and put everything in, in one day. So, for instance, some days I would do 2 types of chest wrokouts,1 bicep, 1 tricep, 1 leg, 1 shoulder. Sometimes I would skip some muscle, since I can only workout for like 30 ~ 40 min, at most.   As far as nutrition goes, I never cared about it, as long as I eat some vegetables everyday. Typically, I would eat no less than 3300 cal/ day (Not sure about the exact number since I don't keep track of it). But during the season, I would eat 3600 cal ~ 4000 cal per day just so I could maintain my weight."

Brogress,2tud6i,JaHetIsChris,-10,Wed Jan 28 04:01:42 2015 UTC,"Whenever I see an anorexic, I always wonder what is the best way to explain to them that they need to work out to get their ideal body.  I know many are in a negative feedback loop. They want to get skinny and look god, but the body goes into a catabolic state, eating away expensive muscle and trying to preserve what little fat is left. So when an anorexic feels their body, they still feel that fat (skinny fat), and continue trying to restrict calories to lose the fat.  Like I know anorexics want to look sexy but they can't just get their. How do you explain to them, the solution to anorexia isn't to eat more and get chubby (like I've seen most anorexics. It seems like the therapy they go through is body acceptance, which just leads to fat gain), but to work out, and get healthy?"
Brogress,2tz3ul,DaMoose94,3,Wed Jan 28 16:21:33 2015 UTC,"you're going to be disappointed with your body if you keep doing what you're doing. You obviously want to cut down to a low body fat and get abs and shit but you've got to walk before you run.  Eat 2.5k cals every day: 1g/1lb protein, get your 20/30/50 (carbs/fat/protein) and don't fuck around when you're at the gym, add in some cardio and you'll be losing weight and gaining muscle at a nice steady pace.  posting your workout would be helpful"

Brogress,2tz3ul,I_eat-kittens,12,Wed Jan 28 16:46:42 2015 UTC,Dude I'm the same height. You're going to turn yourself into a hungry skeleton.    You aren't special to where you magically put on muscle faster unless you're enhanced. Take your time cutting.
Brogress,2tz3ul,I_eat-kittens,-15,Wed Jan 28 17:07:48 2015 UTC,people gain muscle at sifferent rates
Brogress,2tz3ul,NixonNeverleft,3,Wed Jan 28 19:08:55 2015 UTC,"At your height and weight, your bmr is around 1850 calories a day. I don't know how intense your workouts are, but let's say your burning an additional 500 on the workout at least. So your running a deficit of 1350 a day. This would work out to 2.7 pounds of weight loss a week. You don't need to lose a 140 pounds in a year (less because your bmr would change). Add 850 calories of high protein content food and lose it at a more sustainable pace. You would still lose a pound a week with that diet.   Edit: assuming cheat days are negligible. You will probably feel way better too"
Brogress,2tz3ul,NixonNeverleft,2,Wed Jan 28 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"My diet right now is almost entirely proteins and some fats, my objective it to cut out as much carbs as possible so that my body will have no choice but to turn to fats for energy. It's something I came up with myself after learning a lot about anatomy and physiology at school. I could be wrong or I could be right, but I'm willing to lose some muscle in order to lose the fat. High protein and bulking workouts will hp curb the muscle loss"
Brogress,2tz3ul,xzTa,2,Wed Jan 28 20:53:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, cut down on carbs. There is nothing scientifically wrong with what you just said. High protein will help you not lose muscle, and low cal will make you lose weight even if you ate nothing but carbs.   But you also ask for tips on maintaining the weight loss. This diet is not sustainable and you may gain the fat back, when it ends, while having lowered muscle mass. The loss of muscle mass makes your bmr lower (muscle needs more calories to sustain itself than fat).   If you don't grow and maintain muscle there is a good chance you will gain weight back when diet ends and it will be even harder to lose next time if you do gain it back.   If you are careful with calories when you finish weight loss the weight will stay off, but it will be easier with added muscle"
Brogress,2tz3ul,oppressedshitlord,1 point,Wed Jan 28 21:21:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I'm trying my best to maintain muacle while cutting out as many calories as possible.

Brogress,2tngca,Pelarboar,1 point,Wed Jan 28 19:44:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, damn. I thought I had posted a vid, but it seems like I hadn't.   Here is vid of a 160 kg bench 2 months ago. Sorry about the video being sideways. I got an easy 165 few weeks after that.  And yeah, my lifts have went from 140kg/140kg/190kg to 165kg/180kg/210kg in a little over a year.  I have been  focusing on the legs for the last year. About the 5 year history of training - first 2-3 years I did not have the greatest routine or diet, so there's that :)  Edit. I want to add that squatting has always been the hardest lift for me, while bench has been the easiest."
Brogress,2tngca,PinkBootedBandit,6,Thu Jan 29 10:33:32 2015 UTC,That's an elite level of lifting. Especially for his body weight.
Brogress,2tngca,eykanspelgud,2,Mon Jan 26 16:05:29 2015 UTC,What's your training regimen and diet like?
Brogress,2tngca,Qwaybin,3,Sun Jan 25 23:21:25 2015 UTC,Are you doing steroids?
Brogress,2tngca,Afroemo,3,Sun Jan 25 23:21:40 2015 UTC,No steroids here.
Brogress,2tngca,c4lmlikeab0mb,14,Sun Jan 25 23:48:57 2015 UTC,"after that comment nobody aint gonna believe your 345 bench press claim, unless you upload a video where you bench press 345 of course."
Brogress,2tngca,DrCreeps,7,Mon Jan 26 02:59:09 2015 UTC,why would you have to be on steroids to bench 345?
Brogress,2tngca,aizxy,9,Tue Jan 27 23:46:52 2015 UTC,Some people suck and look desperately for a reason to explain why someone is better than them.
Brogress,2tngca,c4lmlikeab0mb,3,Wed Jan 28 15:30:14 2015 UTC,I think its more that his bench is so high and his squat is so low in comparison
Brogress,2tngca,user7779,1 point,Wed Jan 28 16:15:34 2015 UTC,That's because he has a disc issue. Taking steroids would boost your squat too.

Brogress,2tngca,Marsinator,1 point,Wed Jan 28 15:16:56 2015 UTC,"If you have been lifting for two years like OP and are not at least in the 200s, you're not doing the program. Don't even care what program you're ""doing"" - you aren't adhering to it. There is not a single progression based program out there that cannot take a healthy adult male into the 200s in two years... SS should get you at least ridiculously close within a year. Eating is a part of any program."
Brogress,2tngca,boastfulbadger,10,Wed Jan 28 17:19:09 2015 UTC,height? what type of diet/routine did you follow?
Brogress,2tngca,superphotonerd,-2,Sun Jan 25 21:48:35 2015 UTC,"I went through a bunch of cutting and bulking cycles. Calculated my tdee and just added or subtracted 500 calories depending on whether I was bulking\cutting. I made sure I hit my protein and the rest of the calories were attained however I felt like getting them (sometimes not the most clean calories). Once I got to about 190lbs, I ate super clean and ate only food I cooked and a lot of chipotle.   As far as routines go..I did a ppl split with a shoulders/ab day when I felt like I should keep it easy. I didn't really take rest days when I didn't absolutely need to (which was maybe once a week). As far as cardio, I played basketball a few times a week depending on how on top of my diet was for that week."
Brogress,2tngca,superphotonerd,2,Sun Jan 25 22:32:06 2015 UTC,how long were those cycles?
Brogress,2tngca,BroomSIR,4,Mon Jan 26 00:10:45 2015 UTC,Probably a few months each. I wasn't super strict with the amount of time. Depends on if I hit a specific lift number I wanted or a specific weight goal. I just made sure I was pretty consistent with whatever I decided until I switched back over. I even had to learn how to cook lol

When I first started working out it was my main focus so I didn't take many before shots of my full body. Also, I don't have any info because I'm pretty new to building muscle and kind of wing it with my workout. I have an idea of what I'm doing with goals in mind and what not, but I couldn't tell you many of the names of the exercises that I do, or what I weigh because I don't focus on the number on the scale.

Brogress,2tnvw1,ThisIsWhyImHott,1 point,Mon Jan 26 00:45:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) I do deadlifts at 50kgs + weight of the bar (which is shorter so it weighs around 14-15kgs), squats while holding a 20 kg plate , my flexibility sucks so my range of motion is limited and I find this the best way to get a really deep squat while keeping my form in check . I've also incorporated using the squat rack as well, but I keep it pretty light because of the mobility issues ; im working on progressing though! I do inclined leg press , 110kgs + weight of the press, which I have no idea what that weighs. Then I do a couple other things that I don't know the names of that I finish up my gym session with !

Brogress,2t9r2x,xnzs,25,Thu Jan 22 08:11:29 2015 UTC,"I made a post here about 8-9 months ago.  A lot of the criticism I received was that there wasn't enough show of my upper body, and that the pictures overall weren't very telling of my progress. I agreed, and the Instagram filters also added to the problem. I've noticed significant progress in my upper body since that last post, and decided to make another to share it.   Unfortunately my lifts haven't really grown much, as I've been focusing solely on muscle growth and aesthetics, rather than strength.   I'm totally open to any suggestions on how to balance both, because my strength gains have suffered, while I've weirdly gained lean muscle.   Anyway, the two first pics in the album are the same as the last post. These are the only pics I have of when I FIRST started lifting. I wish I had more. I was around 130lb in those. The rest of the pics are from within the past week or so, so very recent.   All criticism and advice you guys/gals have will be falling on very open ears.  Diet: Well, I really don't have one. I don't count macros or anything. I just eat a lot of protein heavy foods. Lots of salmon, lean beef, pork chops/steak, ground turkey/pork, and veggies. And ice cream, lots of ice cream. Some days I lift fasted, and some days i eat a small preworkout meal of some rice and beef.   Body fat: I have no idea what my body fat is. When I first started lifting, I had that checked by my PT and it was 13.8. I haven't had it checked since, I'm not really concerned about my BF, but I guess it'd be nice to have it for stats sake.  Lifts: My bench 1RM (185) and DL 1RM (315) have not changed since my last post. My front squat has gone from 165 to 185. I've been trying to work on my back squat and get more comfortable with the bar on my back, but it still hurts like a bitch to go over 225. I'm at a stalemate as far as my lifts are concerned, and I don't know how to fix it. I feel as if I'm very weak for my size. I don't want to be one of those people that's ""all fluff, no function"" but I seriously don't know how to change that. I want to learn how to balance both.  Routine: I lift 4 days a week. I have a push/press day, pull day, quad day, hamstring day. Not necessarily in that order, though. For push day, I do incline/flat barbell bench, barbell (standing and seated) shoulder presses, dumbbell bench, dumbbell shoulder presses. Also, one armed dumbbell presses and one armed dumbbell bench presses.  For pull day, I focus on rows, curls and cable isolation. I normally do about 6-8 different exercises a session, so i switch it up each week. If i didnt, id be doing like 15-20 lifts alone on my pull day. So, i rotate different rows, curl variations, and cable work each week. Tricep pull downs, cable flyes, isolated one armed cable rows/pulldowns/curls, reverse db flyers, bent over rows, rack pulls, shrugs, hammer curls, reverse ez bar curls, regular ez bar curls, straight bar curls, db curls, tricep extension (w/dumbbells), etc.   Everything is moderate weight, high reps. For instance for shrugs, I'll do 4x20x245. For cable work, I always do 5-6 sets of 10-15 reps. For any dumbbell work, I'll lower the reps a bit, and do 4-6 sets of 8-10."
Brogress,2t9r2x,aManPerson,4,Thu Jan 22 08:20:40 2015 UTC,"2 thoughts come to mind for trying to further advance strength:   switching up reps and how heavy you lift, periodization lifting.  for a few weeks, like 5 sets with 5 reps at 80% 1RM.  then decrease weight to 70% 1RM and do 5x10.  find new 1RM, then jump back up to 80% 1RM with 5x5 for a few weeks. one question i've found asking myself, am i eating excess protein for my current LBM size, so i have enough raw resources to build FURTHER than i am?  try and start counting your protein intake, you might not be high enough.   just a few thoughts."
Brogress,2t9r2x,aManPerson,4,Thu Jan 22 19:28:41 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the kind of advice I need. I'm going to give this a shot. When you say a few weeks do you mean about a month?   I'm going to keep a much tighter grasp on my protein consumption too. I must not be eating enough. Gotta start packing it in...  I'm going to have to really watch that though. I'm already pushing 160, and don't want to get much bigger than that. I'm really happy with my current frame, and don't want to sacrifice my newfound proportion and ""contentment"" for a higher bench or deadlift. I'm going to have to really watch what I eat, and try to keep a balance.  Thank you so much for your thoughts. I'm taking notes here."
Brogress,2t9r2x,aManPerson,3,Thu Jan 22 21:22:19 2015 UTC,"was getting my car fixed earlier so i couldnt look at your pics.  your shoulders look great and i agree, you do have good definition now.  if i had to choose an area of you i'd like to see MORE muscle on, i couldn't decide.  your proportions do look great."
Brogress,2t9r2x,sorc,2,Thu Jan 22 21:54:07 2015 UTC,"ive read periodization in a few articles now.  one i remember, they did 2 weeks at each weight/rep/set combination.  then went high reps/low weight, med weight/reps, high weigh/low reps.  but it's not a huge change in weight mind you.  for a lot of lifts, for me, the difference between doing 5 and 10 reps, is one notch on the machine/5 pounds.  in comments on reddit, someone explained it as ""when you go back to the lower weight, you can focus on form again and make sure you aren't fucking up and doing something wrong.  then you work back up to high weight again and still have great form"".  remember though more strength does not necessarily mean bigger muscles.  (but no one ever deadlifted 500 pounds looking like they weigh 100 pounds).  although, in highschool, i did see a guy weight 165 set a state record.  he squatted 515 pounds.   soooooooo, ya........"

Brogress,2t9r2x,renewedhope,2,Thu Jan 22 15:58:56 2015 UTC,"I made the switch from solely strength training (3x3's, 5x3s, and 5x5s) to high volume, high rep training.   The reason I switched it up was because I had hit such a hard wall with my strength progression. Nothing was progressing anymore, I so I decided to do switch to the higher reps/sets and adding more exercises into my daily regimen.   My diet hasn't really changed a bit, except I do eat more now. I still feel like I'm not eating enough though, even with the 7lbs I've added. :/"
Brogress,2t9r2x,ILuhMeSomeBlackWomen,1 point,Thu Jan 22 21:16:47 2015 UTC,What do you consider high rep.  bench for example.
Brogress,2t9r2x,StillNeverNotFresh,1 point,Fri Jan 23 02:17:16 2015 UTC,"For barbell bench, I never go higher than 10 reps per set. I'll either do 5x10 or 8x6.   Compared to when I did 6x3s and 5x5s, I've seen much better gains. As far as muscle growth, anyway."

Brogress,2t9r2x,OnceUponTheCross,2,Fri Jan 23 09:14:45 2015 UTC,"Ooohhh, that is so hard. If I absolutely HAD to choose ONE it'd be Ben & Jerry's Milk and Cookies.   Another close favorite is this dulce de leche ice cream made by this local ice cream shop. Their flavors rotate, so when they have it, I jump at the chance to get it. Soooooooo good.   Ive been really digging some of the Bluebell seasonal flavors, too. Their peppermint bark was delicious and I'm loving their current Mardi Gras king cake. :)"
Brogress,2t9r2x,ranman1124,2,Fri Jan 23 09:43:11 2015 UTC,"I miss Mardi Gras cake :(  I think there's a common ""health ideal"" that ice cream is not healthy for you, and a lot of people cut that shit out religiously... but looking at the macros and not really giving a fuck it's not too bad for you. especially if you're just trying to put on weight.  That being said, I'm gonna get some ice cream this weekend.  No American stuff here in Germany yet, but they do have some interesting brands here."

If we want get nit picky I'd say you could work a bit on back development in terms of width for proportionality's sake. The separation and size seem to overpower the width.

Brogress,2t8lsm,Devtanix,2,Sun Jan 25 08:14:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I started off doing reverse pyramid training doing a Chest/Back/Legs on a M/W/F split and cycling carbs.  Reverse pyramid training involves doing only 2 working sets per exercise, starts with the 1st set to failure usually between the 6-8 rep range and the 2nd set with 90% of the previous weight but +1 rep. Chest day: Bench press Incline bench press Dumbbell curls Tricep extensions     Back day: Pullups Barbell rows OHP Chinups Deadlifts    Leg day: Back squats Hip thrusts SLDL Calves    Starting 3 weeks ago I've been doing a PPL variant with a lot more volume though, definitely feeling it a lot more in my chest especially. Diet: The diet was definitely 90% of this cut, important to point out because so many beginners (or at least myself definitely) do not understand that DIET IS EVERYTHING. Workout days : P/C/F:200/200/80 in grams with a total of 2200kcals. Rest days: P/C/F: 180/30/50 in grams with a total of 1500kcals.    I didn't always adhere that strictly to my diet daily, but made sure I compensated for any deficits/overeats, ensuring I had a strict weekly deficit. For the first 101 days I did not have a single cheat meal, then came Xmas holidays and I put my diet on hold for 14 days. I gained 1.3kg including water weight during that period.  My priorities were: 1. Meet protein goal (>180g) 2. Get under total kcal (<2200kcal, <1500kcal) 3. Cycle carbs ( Low on rest, high on workout days)  The first 101 days I ate really clean and did 0 cardio, after xmas break I started training in ICU where I was on my feet all the time and my TDEE increased by 500kcals (calculated by additional weight loss). I added cardio into my routine and started eating less clean ( fried chicken/ potato chips/ ice cream) but sticking to the same net calories. Let me just say that eating clean definitely feels different- less hunger, feel better, lift better and although I'm leaner now, I feel like I looked better when I ate clean. On the flipside- Ice cream."

Brogress,2t0u99,Name_Change,3,Tue Jan 20 08:03:05 2015 UTC,"In the past 4 months my squat has gone from 365 to 455lbs. Bench from 235 to 275. Deadlift fron 405 to 475. This is from one cycle of Smolov for squats and Smolov Jr. for bench. My deadlift just got better from all the squats.  All the other time I was running PPL though. Doing 5x5 on compound lifts. I didn't up the weight as often as I could have, but I was more worried about size rather than strength. Now I'm switching over to more strength work and want to compete in powerlifting. Most likely going to train for another year before I compete."

Brogress,2t0u99,theJUIC3_isL00se,7,Tue Jan 20 14:22:35 2015 UTC,"I count calories and protein. 500 calorie surplus for bulking. Cutting was anywhere from 300-1000 calorie deficit. Protein I try to get at least 200g. When I cut I'm pretty strict, but bulking I'll eat whatever kind of foods I feel like. Cutting is a lot of vegetables, meat, rice, eggs, and protein shakes. Also, when i bulk I can get enough calories and protein without shakes, so i only drink them when cutting."

My personal advice for cut is that if you are not going to compete don't try to be too specific with your diet, cause it's only gonna stress you. And also don't get afraid when it looks like you're loosing some of your gains ( it's gonna look like that) just go trought the cut and at the end you realise it was all worth it."
Brogress,2suqov,goudendonut,3,Mon Jan 19 04:29:21 2015 UTC,"So first off this is like incredible progress with a great ending physique.

Brogress,2suqov,MAccNasty,10,Mon Jan 19 00:07:11 2015 UTC,"Not all progress is due to steroids... You can tell he was holding fat at 198, all he did was cut. Stop being mediocre and actually put in some damn effort. Just because he's bigger than you automatically means he's juicing?"

I started bulking since I play Rugby and wanted to have more size/strength on my side. I bulked for roughly about 7-8 months (slow bulk) and got up to about 198lbs by the end of it. After that with summer coming (I'm Australian) I started a hard-cut for about 2 months, and have been maintaining since then !"
Brogress,2stpsf,emmick4,6,Sun Jan 18 12:27:54 2015 UTC,"incredible progress, was your diet that restrict? or you just had a mild calorie surplus?"

Honestly I just used the cliché IIFYM calculator !  http://iifym.com/iifym-calculator/  That helped me to see how many grams of carbs, fatso and protein I should be hitting. I sort of just ignored the fibre intake part though haha"
Brogress,2stpsf,lemonrabbits,1 point,Mon Jan 19 01:01:42 2015 UTC,Well it looks like it did the trick for you! And when you were cutting that didn't affect any of your lifting? Just kept to the same routine? I saw you had the low/high carb days; did that correspond to any body part day?
Brogress,2stpsf,velvet_drape,0,Mon Jan 19 21:26:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks man !   When I changed from bulking to cutting my program changed a lot as well. On my bulk, I was doing a 5x5 strength program but that quickly changed to a 6-day split program, focusing on lower weight with higher reps when I started cutting. My exercises changed from only compound movements to more isolate exercises (I still did compound movements while cutting, but obviously wasn't doing the 5x5 for them). My strength changed a lot too but that happens when you're in a caloric deficit.  At first I tried to make my high-carb days land on bigger muscle regions (chest or back for example), but since I only had 2 high-carb days a week, it was too difficult to organise. So I kept my workout routine the same, and made my high-carb days fall onto my Shoulders day and Full-Body day. Eating excess carbs actually refuelled my depleted glycogen stores from the previous days so I was still noticing muscle gains with rapid fat loss."
Brogress,2stpsf,AtlasAtlasAtlas,1 point,Tue Jan 20 01:48:12 2015 UTC,Awesome. Thanks for the detail! I'm just starting a cut and your info is extremely helpful. Thanks! Hopefully my cut goes half as well as yours :p
Brogress,2stpsf,Nickbronline,1 point,Tue Jan 20 14:08:41 2015 UTC,My diet was pretty strict. I calculated my TDEE and added 500 calories every two weeks. Towards the end of the bulk I would sometimes even increase by 500cals every week since progress started to slow down.

Brogress,2s8r5a,trevorparsons,2,Sun Jan 18 20:55:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for replying. You are correct. I've been completely wrong about this. Hair does not grow faster or shorter based on cuts. It's your general health that starts at the cell division with the follicle.

The best thing to do if you wanna lose fat and build muscle is to get on a good diet plan, cardio and lifting weights, emphasis on the diet though. Biggest mistake I made was that I starved myself for the first year and I looked sickly as hell.

I only did cardio twice a day and didn't elect anything after 6, which later on I realized was a very big mistake, cause then it looked like I was flabby, but it was actually all the loose skin, so I never really removed my shirt in public. Later on though, I educated myself about dieting and stuff. After that I started bulking and putting on muscle mass, then started cutting and now this is what my body looks like. I think what you need to do is put on some muscle mass, cause if it jiggles, it's probably fat, count your calories and put on muscle."

She looks scrawny with baggy skin under her arms and legs now and she complains about jiggling but she doesn't work out at all because she is ""not worried about gaining muscle. Muscle won't make her less fat"" WTF? But people seriously think like this constantly.

Brogress,2rv6u1,Gsanta1,2,Sat Jan 10 05:20:58 2015 UTC,To get abs you NEED to exercise them. Do crunches to target the upper abs and leg lifts and sit ups to target the lower abs and obliques.  Also learn to do Dragon Flags if you wanna really hit those abs.
Brogress,2rv6u1,Russz,2,Fri Jan 9 20:55:26 2015 UTC,Dragon Flags are my favorite. Gets me nice and sore
Brogress,2rv6u1,Russz,2,Sat Jan 10 03:44:03 2015 UTC,"There are no lower and upper abs. It's a single muscle, so you don't need two types of different exercises."
Brogress,2rv6u1,Russz,1 point,Sat Jan 10 18:49:10 2015 UTC,"It's a single muscle but it functions in parts. If you do hip flexion, the prime movers are the abdominals but the lower ab fibers and the obliques do most of the contracting. If you do a crunch, the lower ab fibers still contract but not to the same extent as the upper ab fibers. It's like the trapezius muscle. If you do rows, the fibers at the top of the traps don't contract and therefore don't develop. If you do shrugs, the lower fibers dont contract and dont develope. It's still one muscle but not all the fibers of the muscle contract statically.  So we're both correct, but I'm being more technical."
Brogress,2rv6u1,Russz,0,Sat Jan 10 19:04:00 2015 UTC,"If you do hip flexion, the prime movers are the abdominals but the lower ab fibers and the obliques do most of the contracting   Yes, there is of course variation between exercises in how much other muscles contribute, but the rectus abdominis still contracts as a single unit."
Brogress,2rv6u1,shikamiya,1 point,Sat Jan 10 19:16:06 2015 UTC,What I'm trying to say is yes it does contract as a single unit but not every fiber exerts the same amount of force in an exercise. If you only do crunches you will have underdeveloped lower abs.

Brogress,2rv6u1,TheBrownFlavor,2,Sat Jan 10 01:35:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much! -The first 1.5 weeks, I started counting calories via myfitnesspal (I didn't even change the type of foods I ate, just the portions) and started walking in the evening during this period I lost about 5 lbs! I eventually started running only half a mile (I was too out of shape to do more) 2-3 weeks until I finally built up the endurance to run one full mile. -1.5 months in, I started I weight lifting (5 days a week) and running every single day (only 1-2 miles) AND I started following a Ketogenic diet (there's an awesome subreddit for it). I had a summer job that allowed me to afford eating chipotle every single day so I had the best dietary change ever. (REMEMBER: Diet=80% Exercise=20%) -Towards the end of the summer, I started an intermittent fast (which only helped me maintain weight because I turned 21 and started drinking excessively) -THE REGRESS: Two weeks before school started, I had RA training so I had literally no time to work out or eat healthy (our meals were provided so I ate whatever was there). At the beginning of the semester our school opened a Chik-fil-A, and I started eating here twice a day (no lie)... this and the lack of readily available free time for exercise caused me to gain 15lbs. I refused to let my whole summer go to waste, so I slowly got back into the swing of things, adjusting to demands of college. -September: I only worked 2 times a week during my weight training class doing whatever splits we had that day, and started doing midnight runs in training for a 10K -October: I made it my goal to run a minimum of how many days there were in a month (I exceeded this) and I also began intermittent fasting again. I eat one Massive ass meal Ketogenic meal in the caf a day. -November: Still intermittent fasting (I don't calories anymore) I try to do full body workouts 4 times a week and I run 2-4 miles every day . On the weekends I reward myself with one carb meal! It has been a long and slow journey but I'm proud of my discipline and truly believe that if I can get this far, anyone else can too! -December: I was able to stop with ""food rewards"" continued to intermittent fasting but with school out for break, I was able to run a minimum of 4 miles a day. I would also do full body workouts 3-4 a week. ***As far as intermittent fasting and a ketogenic diet go, I feel absolutely amazing. I'm currently taking 21 hours and working and I feel as though I have more energy now than I've had in previous semesters! On the downside, now I have try to save money to buy new clothes haha"

Brogress,2rv6u1,galacticexplorer,3,Sat Jan 10 01:48:00 2015 UTC,"Nice brogress! If you did weightloss stuff, start lifting, eat 250 to 500 calories above basal metabloic rate, and possibly remove any cardio (or at least up your calories to match if you need to do it).   As for lifting, there are a butt ton of good programs out there, and if you are making newbie gains, any program will still get you results, ""newbie gains"", so long as you're consistent. With that in mind, in the fitness community, a lot of people recommend Strong Lifts 5x5 or Starting Strength. I would also add in some accessory work to work your vanity muscles (biceps, calves, traps, etc.) since these programs will have them laggin', even if you've been on these programs for a while (I don't care what Mehdi or Riptoe say, these things laaaag like running a 56K modem on a multiplayer game).  Good luck, bro!   edit: Also, about them dar abs. Squats and deadlifts work your core (so... abs). It varies for each person, but I started seeing mine when I was squatting 1.2x my body weight and deadlifting 1.5x. Then I got fat because I'd rather be forever bulking for them gainz. You do you, bro!"

Implying that the key to having abs is by getting leaner. However partially true, you can't reveal something that isn't there in the first place. Meaning, my abs weren't that thick to reveal anything.   My abs started to show when I incorporated ab work daily for 3 months. There's a good reason why bodybuilders despite being on a low bodyfat still do abdominal exercises.  By the way, good progress! But leaning out more and adding abdominal work will help define your mid section."
Brogress,2rv6u1,yousirnaime,1 point,Fri Jan 9 16:28:39 2015 UTC,"I had the same issue - got really lean and still really no abs - I never worked them at all.  I'd say hit your abs more on next muscle building phase and then on next cut see if you have better abs.   You also look like you are right at that border of when it gets really hard to lose fat @ approximately 10-11% - drop it to 7-8% and you might see more definition, but again, if the muscles are bigger you'll see them at a higher bf%.   Also, you might just genetically not be set up for really visible defined abs.  Look up the bodybuilder ""Boyer Coe"" - He never really got abs because of genetics."

I dont have a 6 pack, just some ab definition, but I've heard from a lot of people that its not so much like sit-ups that'll get you the abs, but its the big 3 lifts, squat, bench, and deadlift that really work your core and will get you abs"
Brogress,2rv6u1,wallymomouth,1 point,Sat Jan 10 00:02:37 2015 UTC,"First of all, co grants on the weight loss! That's super impressive, you've done so much great work.   The next step is working in the muscle. It's hard to focus on fat reduction and muscle building at the same time. You've done great at the fat burning, now time switch to muscle building portion.   Lots of ab exercises/(crunches, bridges, bosu crunches, weighted sit-ups, dead bugs, etc), and lots and lots of protein."

Brogress,2rv6u1,wallymomouth,-2,Sat Jan 10 01:04:27 2015 UTC,Stronglifts or Starting Strengh and eating at a 500 surplus are a good starting point
Brogress,2rv6u1,xnzs,1 point,Fri Jan 9 18:16:33 2015 UTC,"Now that you've learned to control your diet, start using that control and start following a bodybuilding diet.   I've had success with this one. I know it says ""fatloss"" but with your composition, the crazy high protein will help your recomposition like crazy.  6'1"" @ 162lbs + another year of Noob gains leaves you with a lot of room to add mass naturally.   After a couple months of a high protein diet, up your calories. Get on a lifting routine that has progressive overload, heavy ass compound lifts, and builds in some volume work each session. I've had luck with 5/3/1, but others might recommend starting strength"

I included cardio at 30 minutes of incline walking, 5 times a week.  I kept my diet clean and macros were around 40/20/15 eating 5 meals a day. I enjoyed a cheat meal every Sunday evening where I let myself go crazy and eat whatever.  Back to a bit of a bulk now though!

Brogress,2rvkfe,closerthanexpected,2,Fri Jan 9 17:48:33 2015 UTC,Do you ever stand in the shower and then flex your quads and glide your arm up and down your leg to feel the definition of the muscles? That alone makes doing a million squats all worth it.
Brogress,2rvkfe,closerthanexpected,1 point,Fri Jan 9 21:21:30 2015 UTC,Back routine?  Also did you do full body workouts etc? Or Biceps and Back on the same day?
Brogress,2rvkfe,closerthanexpected,1 point,Mon Jan 12 00:56:17 2015 UTC,"I always do back on a separate day. I normally start with a heavy exercise and use low volume, such as dumbbell rows for 4 sets of 8. Then I would do some sort of the following three exercises: supported row, cable row, pulldown. Normally 4 sets of 10 for each of these movements. I do pullovers and hyperextensions at the end of all my back workouts and also train traps on back day. Thanks for asking!"

Lifting Routine:  Did a basic newbie/bro split (still doing it).  Everything is 3-5 sets depending on how I feel at the time.  I start at a weight I think I can do for 10, then 8, another 8, then 6 til failure.  I know it's not really regimented, but it worked for me.  I'll be honest, starting off, I would go heavier than I could ever do without a spot and my friends would assist me.  I could maybe get 4-5 on my own then they would assist me to 8.  Also, I ALWAYS do chest on Monday :P but the rest of the days I pick a body part depending on my recovery.  For the most part it was Monday(Chest) Tues(back) Wed(arms) Thur(Shoulders) Sunday(legs).  Friday and Saturday as rest days because I like to go out on those days. I also do abs at the end of every workout.  Rope pull downs (6 sets for 10-12 reps) and this oblique machine that twists side to side (3 sets for 15 reps)  Chest   Flat bench Incline dumbbells  Flat dumbbell (I sometimes skip this) Weighted dips Incline machine Cable fly Machine fly Burn out on 1 last set of unweighted dips   Back   Rackpulls OR deadlifts depending on how my legs feel Dumbbell rows Lat pulldowns The diagonal vertical pull weighted machine thing (sorry I'm not sure what it's called, I can find a pic if people really want to know) Weighted Row machine (sorry I'm not sure what it's called, I can find a pic if people really want to know) Cable rows with the cable on the ground and bent over a bit (again, not sure what to call this) Burn out with wide grip pull ups   Arms   Close grip bench Barbell curls Seated tricep extensions (?) alternating db curls Weighted dips (much more vertical angle than my chest day dip) Wavy bar(?) curls Tricep pulldowns Preacher curls SKullcrushers or dips (depends on how I feel at this point) Cable curls   Shoulders:   Seated db press Seated reverse fly superset with shrugs Standing 1 arm lateral raises Face pulls Press machine Lateral raises on cable Seated military press on the smith machine   Legs:   Low bar squats Stationary barbell lunges Leg press Leg extensions   Stats  Bench: 235  Dead lift: 385  Squat: 245"
Brogress,2rpmj0,huzzy,5,Thu Jan 8 06:36:56 2015 UTC,Reason why I ask about your before picture is because you seem to already have some muscle definition going on. It seems like you were working out before this too.

You have clearly gotten bigger, your lats are wider.  I'd say you should wait till you are 17/18 before expecting serious gains.  Some people just gain muscle very slowly, but I know that you will get gains faster in a few years; I see no armpit or facial hair so your clearly still going through puberty. Wait till you're 18 you will definitely be pubertized enough :P  Right now I'm 17 and a half and am increasingly getting more facial hair and armpit hair, also I now have a bit of chest hair.

Brogress,2r0x3u,tekbubble,58,Thu Jan 1 18:59:12 2015 UTC,"I posted this in naturalbodybuilding earlier, and they recommended I xpost it here.  I'm 5'8"", 45, started at 186, dropped to 150 (4-5%), currently at 176 (10-12%bf).    For the last two years, I have not skipped a single day. Initially, I just wanted to lose weight and be healthy. First year and a half was beach body products (P90X twice, P90X2, Body Beast, P90X3, Body Beast again). Since July, I've been trying to add some muscle (up 5-7lbs of muscle since July) with brosplit, 9-12 sets per workout in the 2-6 rep range almost exclusively. First year was just blindly following programs. 2014, I've done the research in pursuit of optimal.  Muscleforlife.com's Mike Matthews has provided a great deal of my information.  Although I've not taken a rest day in two years, some days the workout is mobility, yoga, etc... I've had a lot of ups and downs, successes and set backs. I've waaay overreached several times and left some gains on the table. But I'm sticking with it in 2015 and want to add another 10 lbs of muscle this year, maybe 15 if I'm lucky, and 20-25lbs by the time I'm 50 (5 years from now).   Let me know if you have any questions. I would also appreciate any critiques you have of my physique. I feel my chest is my weakest body part. Then legs. I don't plan on competing, but maybe once I hit the 50 year-old bracket, who knows. Right now I'm just enjoying the process and trying to reach my genetic potential after getting a very late start in life.  Appreciate all the natural body builders here and enjoy watching this subreddit everyday.   Thanks,  I'm in position"

I also play basketball every Sunday.  Now for cardio, I do HIIT about twice a week by doing intervals on the recumbent bike for 6-10 minutes, play basketball once a week, and do a P90X3 workout once a week.

Brogress,2r0x3u,nightyLEX,11,Thu Jan 1 21:46:46 2015 UTC,"Depends. I track my calories and macros on Fitbit. Every morsel, down to the gram on the scale. When I was bulking, I got up to 3,500 calories. While cutting, started at 2,400 and bottomed out at 2,100 calories. Once I got to ~10% bodyfat, I started reverse dieting. I've gone up 10 calories every day -- currently at 2,300 calories.  I get at least 1.3grams of protein per lb of bodyweight, usually around 230-260 grams protein. I get at least 45 grams of fat, usually 60-80 grams if I have enough room. Carbs go up and down depending on what I'm doing.  So when I'm cutting, my macros may be 50/20/30 (p/f/c) but when I'm bulking they may be 30/20/50 (p/f/c). The key, for me, is getting enough protein and fat... and then trying to get as many carbs as possible.  I get most of my carbs around the workout.  While cutting, all my workouts are fasted. If I workout at night, I'll eat in the morning. When bulking, I eat all day, but try to have some stretches of 4-6 hours without food here and there.  I eat mostly organic, whole foods, especially when cutting, but I'm not religious about it. Of course, protein powder is always in the mix."

Brogress,2r0x3u,lityou,3,Fri Jan 2 03:11:16 2015 UTC,"I try to drink a lot.  I start the day by slamming 16 ounces, then another 16 ounces like 20 minutes later.  Then a couple cups of coffee.  Then 5 liters by noon (1.3 gallons).  From there I start to taper off.  Then, since I usually workout at 5pm, I get a lot of water before and after my workout in the evenings.    I would guess 2-3 gallons a day counting everything.  1.5-2 gallons straight up water."
Brogress,2r0x3u,infinite_zero00,2,Fri Jan 2 11:58:26 2015 UTC,How do you consume that much protein /day? Im having a hard time hitting 150g... What foods are your base? Cant be cheap

It takes a lot of time to track the nutrition, but I don't want to be doing all this exercise and leave it to chance.  I treat it like a hobby, and that kinda helps.  It is definitely a habit that needs to be consistently developed.    The key really is nutrition.  I can easily dial my weight up and down with precision just by monitoring intake and weight/bf measurements.

I had a constant feeling of defeat like a black cloud looming over me that I couldn't shake.    After buying the program, getting a bunch of equipment, and setting it up, it still took me six months to start.  I was getting mentally prepared because this time when I grabbed the tiger by the tail, I was not going to let go.  I felt like it was my last shot to climb out of the pit.  The pit of misery and despair.  The pit of infinite_zero00 would NOT bang.    If I missed one day, I may potential fall back off the cliff.  So I just physically forced my body to do what my mind wanted it to.  Extremely hard for the first 4-6 months, everyday I didn't feel like starting a workout or sticking to my meal plan.  Now, I look forward to it like a hobby and a passion.  Now, I will bang."

Brogress,2r0x3u,snakeplant,9,Thu Jan 1 19:13:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I've pushed through all injuries.  Sometimes that was a bad decision, sometimes a good decision, but overall it's worked out.  I broke a nose, totally dislocated the tip of my pinkie, and hurt my pinkie toe.  My forearms hurt real bad for about four months, and eventually I learned to stop doing what was hurting them.  I have arthritis in my left shoulder and issues with both rotator cuffs.  I get cortisone shots in both shoulders every 6 months, and that helps a lot.  You can see some asymmetry in my arms -- it's because of the shoulders.  I've also had minor pain issues with all my joints at some point, and my back.    It took me too long, but I've learned to get my rest and recovery the hard way this is the #1 key.  I know immediately now when I need to take a deload week when all my joints start hurting.    The #2 key is form.  About six months ago I started watching every youtube video I could find on form.  I had been doing things wrong all along.  I was benching with the bar at my throat and my elbows flaired out and military pressing without my elbows forward, for example.  My form is much better now, and I know what aggravates my existing conditions.    I also take calcium, glucosamine/chondrotin, generous amounts of vitamin D/K/A and C, curcumin, and a great multivitamin that includes minerals (e.g. magnesium, zinc, etc).    If I was smarter earlier, and backed off as soon as something hurt, then I would have better results.  On the other hand, I felt like if I missed a day, I would fall off a cliff so being dedicated helped me keep going.  I also powered through the flu, and working out actually seemed to help me get sick less often and get better quickly.  At first I was getting home from work late, and had to workout late -- that was really hard."
Brogress,2r0x3u,SecretAgentQ,3,Thu Jan 1 19:22:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for your comprehensive reply. Appreciate it. I struggle with injuries - it seems to me that I'm getting injured more than others.

Brogress,2r0x3u,real1g,3,Thu Jan 1 20:16:40 2015 UTC,"You can overcome this.  One of the keys is to be constantly vigilant and aware of a) anything you do that causes pain and b) any small initial injury.  I still sometimes ignore the warning signs but have gotten better.  The best way is to avoid injury.  If something happens, don't aggravate it.  Also, sometimes getting injured more than others could be a sign of overtraining or not getting enough rest/recovery."

Brogress,2r0x3u,lasae,1 point,Thu Jan 1 22:53:58 2015 UTC,"One more thing about avoiding injuries.  I always, always, always warm-up before working out.  It only takes 10 minutes.  I don't do much static stretching.  My main goal is to lubricate the joints and get some blood into all the muscles.  I start by wiggling my toes, the rotating my ankles, then knees... all the was up to my neck and out to my finger tips.    Every joint gets rotated or hinged back and forth 10 times.  I do body squats, stiff leg deadlifts, twists, reaches, a little jogging in place, all that stuff."

I ate the same thing every day except cheat days on Sundays where I'd eat a large dominos and chocolate bar.

I told you to read up on stronglifts since you don't want to do cardio, and you want to use some weights, and you only have an hour.   Losing weight, keeping it off, and getting fit is a lifestyle change that you'll have to stick with for the rest of your life. If you want to get more ideas, that's cool, but none of them are going to be easier or faster with results than anything I suggested or any other program in any of the fitness subreddit FAQs."

Brogress,2qvzdg,TheSimulator,8,Wed Dec 31 04:21:50 2014 UTC,"Probably not the greatest progress for 3 years, but considering how DYEL I started as and how it came in the middle of a hellish degree program, I'm damn proud of it.  Lift progressions are: Bench: 95 -> 245 Squat: 95 -> 285 Deadlift: 135 -> 325 OHP: 55 -> 125  I tried a LOT of things during this period. Started with a brosplit that emphasized building up to a 1 plate bench, then had to switch over to a circuit training-style workout for school tennis team training.   Most of the 2nd year was spent doing miscellaneous BB.com workouts that my buddy would find for us to do, but I also ran SL 5x5 that helped me build the core lifts up to decent numbers.  For about 3/4 my 3rd year, I was pretty seriously into Crossfit (raises downvote shield). For all the shit people give it, Crossfit is awesome for improving strength when done properly. Our trainer was extremely qualified in power- and weightlifting and was adamantly against the ridiculous high-rep Oly lifting shit that is way too common. He really helped correct some serious form issues that were giving me knee and shoulder trouble and also introduced me to Oly lifting. Unfortunately, I had to quit in August after moving for school. I'm somewhat ashamed to say I picked the brosplit back up for most of the semester.  I'm probably going to start a hypertrophy-oriented routine for the new year, especially focusing on getting some respectable size on my arms. I also think I'm going to shoot for joining the 1000 lbs club since I feel like I still have a lot to gain on squat and deadlift.  Diet was basically nonexistent. I never really tracked macros, just kind of tried to eat generally healthy and protein-rich foods. Every now and then I would count calories to figure out rough intake numbers, but it never was something I spent too much time working on."

Brogress,2qvzdg,Creamkrackered,0,Thu Jan 1 11:31:51 2015 UTC,"The reason bro splits get shit is because those routines often put a lot of emphasis on isolating when in reality, a beginner should learn proper form of and focus on the big compounds (bench, squat, deadlift, ohp, etc.).  Also, as far as I know, there is science stating (please don't make me Google it)  that your muscles recover in like 3 days, so it's a good idea to hit each muscle group twice a week, but with less volume than you would with a brosplit where you only hit a body part once per week.  If you pop over to /r/bodybuilding you'll see that a lot of the dudes, myself included, are doing Push/Pull/Legs. I'm personally doing PPLxPPx (x == rest day).  I should mention, on Push days, you're doing all pushing movements, so essentially, you hit chest, shoulders and triceps. On Pull days, you're doing all pulling movements, so back, traps, rear deltoids and biceps. Leg day is self-explanatory."
Brogress,2qvzdg,AirmanElmo,2,Fri Jan 2 01:37:48 2015 UTC,Ah ok that actually makes perfect sense! I also heard about the 3 day recovery. I have made sure to include all the main compound exercises in my work outs and do focus mainly on perfecting those.

Brogress,2qw22h,0urlasthope,1 point,Fri Jan 16 09:44:35 2015 UTC,"first, find a routine/program that is simple but effective and involves small amounts of progress over a long time (I recommend checking out 5x5 stronglifts). Second, be patient. think micro, not macro in the gym. Don't worry about where you will be in a week, a month or a year. Just focus on one rep at a time. I can say that nothing has caused me to fall of the wagon more times than training way to hard so I would get results fast and then being too sore to go back to the gym for a week. After a few weeks of this I just gave up. Third, make sure you are lifting properly. If you have bad form you run a higher risk of getting hurt, which obviously won't help you out. One last thing is hold discipline over motivation. It's easy to get motivated, but it's still an emotional response to your desire to get in shape. If you are disciplined and make yourself workout even when you really don't want to or aren't feeling it, it will carry you a lot further than just being motivated."

Brogress,2qemnl,djg08,5,Fri Dec 26 03:33:40 2014 UTC,"Very, very true."
Brogress,2qemnl,emptycalsxycuriosity,4,Fri Dec 26 03:49:10 2014 UTC,"Just thought that it might be interesting for someone to see the different stages of body condition throughout the year. Some of the photos have descriptions along with them, but if there are any more questions I am more than happy to answer them.     ALL OF THESE IMAGES WERE FOR SELF INTEREST TO SEE HOW MY BODY CHANGES, APOLOGIES FOR BAD QUALITY OF SOME OF THEM AS I WASN'T PLANNING ON POSTING THEM  My year was experimental, that means that I ran programs for a month or two at a time, diets kept changing at that rate also and I kept changing my mind about losing weight and gaining it.     First 5 weeks, I ran Jim Stoppani's 12 week shortcut to size training, with chicken and rice diet. (That is literally all I had, no spices or sauces. I did have protein shakes). I also only done 10min cardio before and after my workout as I was cycling at least 5 times a week to work and back.    Then after Christmas I tried to continue cutting and losing the extra weight I put on over the christmas.  I was doing a simple bro-split of PPL, 6 times per week, still cycling over 5 times per week.   Starting about March time, if I recall correctly I started eating more and just went for clean bulk diet, which turned to shit quickly as I realise how much my body was craving for sweets.  September was my lowest weight, but as the description mentions, I fucked up with Sodium levels and couldn't lose water weight to get leaner. At this point I weighed 77kg.  December is my recent picture of dirty bulking where I was eating everything, they look horrible, but I don't look as bad in clothes and after the gym when I got a pump. At this stage I weigh between 89-91kg depending on time of day.     Last year was experimental for me and I am glad I've done a lot of weird and inconsistent things as now I can concentrate on a goal without wondering ""what if I do this"" in the middle of my program.    My lift history that I could recover can be found here: http://pastebin.com/jh3QnAH1    Currently my lifts are not very good, which is why I am concentrating on strength all next year (All 5RM): Squat - 110kg Bench - 85kg OHP - 55kg Deadlift - 140kg"
Brogress,2qemnl,xmistersuperman,2,Fri Dec 26 01:22:40 2014 UTC,"Tried Keto diet, it was amazing for weight loss, but when I used too much sodium so I had too much water weight that I could not lose. I added more sodium because I had no carbs, but once I started my bulk, I realised that if I would have cut the sodium, I could have gotten leaner   Can you explain that further?"
Brogress,2qemnl,StickyFruit,2,Fri Dec 26 02:13:02 2014 UTC,"Sure, basically I was taking all carbohydrates out of my diet and I read somewhere that a larger sodium intake will help body retain the water better. I may have taken this advice a bit too hard and was eating cottage cheese with higher sodium count instead of protein shakes and bacon rashers for breakfast that were also high in sodium.     In the end I weighed 77kg and although I was the lightest I've ever cut down to, I was nowhere near my best condition and I have already started losing strength in the gym. I simply didn't see the point of cutting further and decided to go on a slow bulk (which quickly turned into dirty bulk).     Second week into my bulk, I came across an article on /r/bodybuilding  , where someone discussed sodium intake and conditioning. I think I will do Keto again early into 2015, but this time cut my sodium in the end to as low as I can to see how dry I can get, before going back onto normal diet."
Brogress,2qemnl,redbarnes,2,Fri Dec 26 03:22:12 2014 UTC,What prior lifting or dieting did you do before 12/13?
Brogress,2qemnl,StickyFruit,1 point,Fri Dec 26 04:10:33 2014 UTC,"Set of dumbbells, a curl bar and a tricep bar (hollow, cheap). Done curls with them, shoulder presses and tricep extensions when I felt like it every few months for a few weeks, along with push ups and pull ups on a ceiling beam. Then get occupied with something else. Rinse and repeat for 1-2 years."
Brogress,2qbyxu,neotheos,15,Thu Dec 25 02:28:25 2014 UTC,First thing I would recommend is dropping the whole Brad Pitt Fight Club mentality. I think it's unrealistic to set goals based on what other people look like and in my opinion he's really skinny in that movie anyway.   I do congratulate you in losing over 40 lbs! You look much better now but you are skinny and the reason you are not seeing results is because you keep vacillating between bulks and cuts.   Eat at a moderate caloric surplus (300-500 cals) and do heavy compound lifts. Focus on setting new PRs. Do this until your 30th birthday and I promise you'll be stronger and look better. Don't worry about cutting at all until then.
Brogress,2qbyxu,1995C220,2,Thu Dec 25 05:36:23 2014 UTC,"I get why guys want the brad Pitt in fight club look, but he definitely is just scrawny. He was like 150lbs in that movie."

Brogress,2qbyxu,disanchez27,1 point,Thu Dec 25 06:41:50 2014 UTC,My main life long goal has always been 6 pack. Is it just not possible with where I am? I figured just a little less body fat and they would show.
Brogress,2qbyxu,Morten14,3,Thu Dec 25 14:38:17 2014 UTC,Do you train your abs?
Brogress,2qbyxu,Morten14,1 point,Thu Dec 25 16:32:46 2014 UTC,Off and on but for the last 6 months very much so.
Brogress,2qbyxu,Morten14,1 point,Thu Dec 25 22:25:40 2014 UTC,"How do you train them? What I found is that some of the most effective ab exercises is the ab-wheel rollout, dragonflag and hanging leg raises. But really, just keep working hard in the gym and eventually they will show. Given your current lifts 1RM and the fact that you trained for two years to reach those tells me that you could have worked harder or more consistently in the gym. So just get at it, train hard and consistently, and you will reach your goal."
Brogress,2qbyxu,tellzit,1 point,Thu Dec 25 22:56:40 2014 UTC,Weighted crunches and planks with a 45lb plate on my back. I never feel much of a burn from ab wheel rollouts. Dragon flags work but they work so much more than abs. I think the reason my 1rms are so low is because I spent that whole time cutting. The first 6 months I did only cardio (no lifting).
Brogress,2qbyxu,TimRemz689,0,Thu Dec 25 23:56:38 2014 UTC,"Dude, crunches sucks for abs and are bad for the spine, stop doing them, there are so many other exercises that are better for abs. Dragon flags primarily targets the abs, and its the abs that are gonna limit you in that exercise. If it also hits some other muscles as well, thats just a bonus. Try working on your dragonflags, watch some form videos. When you can complete just a few dragonflags, not just the eccentric part, your abs should start to show. Also try to do the ab wheel rollouts from standing if you don't feel a burn from ab wheel rollouts."
Brogress,2qbyxu,hr_shovenstuff,3,Fri Dec 26 02:10:34 2014 UTC,"While ab exercises are important for abs, OP is way far away from abs: ab exercises aren't going to make a difference.  The main thing is his body fat.  He's probably around 14-16% (at least) in that picture, and would need to lose 10 pounds to get the ""fight club"" look.  I agree with the previous advice, gain muscle mass and hit new PRs.  Unfortunately, OP is sort of between a rock and a hard place: cutting is going to mean sacrificing some muscle and could leave him even smaller, but bulking means he's going to be fatter than he wants for a while.  I think the second is better long term as long as done properly."
Brogress,2qbyxu,hr_shovenstuff,3,Mon Dec 29 14:59:02 2014 UTC,I'm in the same boat as you. Same height and weight and look about the same. I have cut or maintained in hopes to obtain abs. I have found that I don't have enough muscle to cut down to. I think I'm going to embark on a bulk.

Brogress,2pc4vv,XisanXbeforeitsakiss,2,Mon Dec 15 17:08:41 2014 UTC,"Thanks! I waited 6 weeks (after the surgery, 4 weeks back into exercising) before I started doing any core specific exercises, and even then I started out doing 10-20 crunches one day a week. After two weeks of that low intensity core I started doing more than one ab exercise for 2 sets 10-20 reps. By week 8 of working out I was back to a fairly normal ab routine. Its hard to describe but it was pretty obvious to me what I could and couldnt do just based on my mobility and if I felt any pain I would immediately stop."

Brogress,2pbrph,redbarnes,2,Mon Dec 15 15:11:36 2014 UTC,"It went well, I feel like I preserved most if not all of the muscle mass I gained. The only con was that with low carb diets, no matter how much you eat, protein and fat they will never make you feel full. The cravings were horrible, but other than that it was fine. Next time I start a cut, I think I will focus more in HIIT cardio, and being in a caloric deficit. I'm not really a fan of ""IIFYM"", but I guess it can't hurt giving it a try."
Brogress,2pbrph,Jollywog,1 point,Mon Dec 15 15:30:13 2014 UTC,"dude you have a lot of leeway left to bulk with. i'd honestly suggest having an extremely small bulk, maybe just TDEE+100 and continue that for months on end. at your current state you will gain relentlessly and itll be extremely effecient. you could bulk/cut but youd likely just end up in the same position in the end except itll be far more uncomfortable to change your diet so often and force your body to keep adapting"

Aim to gain 3-4 lbs per month to take full advantage of your testosterone.  I wish I would have done that when I was 17.

Brogress,2p60qg,i_poop_splinters,1 point,Sat Dec 13 20:20:34 2014 UTC,"I've always been a bit on the chubbier side and started strength training a couple of years ago, but was always backwards and forwards between cutting and bulking. Basically, I think had too much body fat and the weight I gained had a bad muscle:fat ratio, i.e. more fat than muscle.  This time around I'm committed to reaching 10% body fat and slow-bulking from there.  Workout  I'm currently running 5/3/1 BBB. The decreased volume over something like SL/SS/TM is really helping with recovery whilst in a deficit.  I started out with 5x10 on the BBB lifts, but have reduced the volume as I got further into my cut and wasn't recovering - currently doing 3x10 with the same weight.  I try and do 2 sessions per week of HIIT on a bike (nothing drastic; just 15 seconds on, 60 seconds off), but this depends on my energy levels and how I'm performing on my lifts that week.  Diet  As for the diet, not a whole lot has changed in terms of the foods I'm eating, I've just reduced portion sizes. The upside of this is that I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.  My calories at the moment are ~2000. 25% Fat, 35% Protein, 40% Carbs. I'm losing around 4lbs a month, but this doesn't normally work out at 1lb per week - I may go -1lb, -0.6lbs, -1.8lbs, -0.6lbs.  Current meals are:     Breakfast  Scrambled Eggs  Small Pineapple Juice + Creatine  Latte with Skimmed Milk     Morning Snack  Whey Protein + Water  Banana     Lunch  Chicken Salad (inc teaspoon of Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar)  Banana     Pre-workout  Cottage Cheese and Pasta     Post-workout  Whey Protein + Milk     Dinner  Homemade Chilli  Sweet Potato  Broccoli  Frozen Mango Chunks  Small piece of Dark Chocolate"

Brogress,2p3tfo,Hereforthefreecake,2,Fri Dec 12 20:29:06 2014 UTC,What routine are you on?
Brogress,2p3tfo,tel0seh,6,Fri Dec 12 20:41:11 2014 UTC,"My own thing really lol. I never actually got into any training routine that is advertised. I've taken the basics and kind of just built my routine around what works best for me. I don't think any one routine is completely right for any one person, so I did it my way. Right now I have it broken down like this as of currently:  Monday/Thursday(Upper Body Day):   Flat Bench - 8 reps x 5 sets with a weight that challenges you on the last reps Seated Over-head Press 10 reps x 3 sets. I usually use about 120 - 135 lbs. Just enough to fatigue the muscles to better isolate chest. My shoulders are already gifted and don't have to do much to make them grow. Incline Dumbbell Fly 10 reps x 5 sets. Moderate weight, but get a good stretch in the center of the pecs. You can super set these with 15 or 20 push-ups if you want to get a pump going lol.   Onto the Back:   Pull Ups - Wide overhand grip, chin to top of bar. I've never had a strong back til about 4 months ago, so still getting better at these. I do 5-6 reps x 3 sets, super-set these with forward-leaning dips if you have a power tower at the gym. Mixes chest with back, but I feel it helps with loosening up the lats for the next set (Plus it keeps the previous chest pump going lol). Seated Iso-Lateral Row Machine - 10 reps x 6 sets (different hand placements for angles) Moderate to heavy weight. I usually do 100lbs each side and work on getting a full stretch and range of motion. Dumbbell Skull Crushers Moderate weight, hammer type as well as under-hand pull away type (make sure you don't drop the weight on your face this way lol). 10-15 reps depending on weight x 6 sets. Shrugs Heavy Weight - 15-20 reps x 3 sets. Squeeze those traps. Bicep Killer Curls Barbell curls using heavy weight. 70lb for me. 8 reps wide, 8 reps normal, 8 reps narrow grip with 15 or less seconds of rest in between x 3 sets. Hammer and Supenated Curls Burn out your biceps with these at the end until your arms are fatigued and pumped. Usually aim for 10 reps each hand with a medium weight dumbbell.   Tuesday/Friday (Legs & Abs):   Squats 8-10 reps x 5 sets. Usually start light on first set (185lbs for me) and move to heavy weight for last 2 sets. This is the bulk of my leg workout so I try to get the most out of it. Calf Risers 20 reps x 5 sets - Moderate weight, I usually use 60lb dumbbells in each hand Forward Lunges Light to Moderate weight to get a pump going - 14 reps (7 each leg) x 5 sets. If your gym has it, add the use of leg extension machines.. They work wonders. Unfortunately my gym got rid of theirs, so I have to push myself on squats and lunges.   Abs/Core: * Hanging Leg Raises - 20 reps x 5 sets. Focus on slow, concentrated movement to feel the burn.   Weighted Crunch/Ab Machine - 25 reps x 5 sets.   I sometimes finish leg day with a run to make sure I exhaust my legs. Might need extra calories on these days.  Supplements Not taking much beside protein and creatine. I just ordered some BCAA's to help with the cut, but that's about it.  5g Creatine  1-2 scoops protein a day  Calories right at 1650 on most days  I may end up adding Wednesdays as a chest only day and switch to M/F Full upper, W Chest, T/Th Lower to maximize my chest as it needs a bit more work I'm finding.  Hope this helps a bit!"

Triceps: overhead seated dumbbell raises, skull crushers, cable pull downs, inverted single arm cable pull downs, and/or dip machine  Tuesday: legs Squats, front squats, extensions, curls, calves  Wednesday: back and bicep Back: lat pulls, seated rows, high seated rows, t-bar rows, close grip pull downs Biceps: 21s, hammer curls, inverted barbell curls, burn out on preacher curls  Thursday: legs Deadlifts, leg press, extensions, curls, calves  Friday: shoulders and chest (I was unhappy with my chest progress so I started doing chest on Fridays as well) Shoulders: military dumbbell press, front raises, lat raises, bent over rear delt raises, upright barbell rows, dumbbell or hex bar shrugs Chest: dumbbell flat and incline press, dumbbell flys, burn out on a machine  Saturday: I superset 4-5 tricep and bicep workouts  Sunday: And on the 7th day, Brodin rested.  As far as macros I don't count them for the time being. I have a hard time gaining weight so I eat basically everything in sight, making sure I get as much protein and carbs as possible. Chicken breast, shakes, tuna, etc. And lots of pasta, rice, and potatoes. I also make a habit to drink a lot of water and stay away from basically all soda, surgery drinks, and candy.

Brogress,2p0qwi,the_lawlz_king,2,Fri Dec 12 03:10:10 2014 UTC,"Routine:  I have changed my routine around since I started. This is the routine I have been doing for the past 4 months.  (I have no specific day for a particular body part) Day 1: Back and Biceps All pulling exercises (4-5 pulling exercises depending how I am feeling) and at the end add preacher curls just to hit biceps a bit more.  Day 2: Chest and Triceps The exact order I do the day in, flat bench, pec deck machine, close grip flat bench, skull crushers and finally cable pulldowns Day 3: Shoulders - over the past 4 months I have neglected shoulders alot maybe did them 5 times over the past 4 months. This is my routine when I do them.  Seated front shoulder press with a Bar, arnolds, lifting a plate in front of me with straight arms (whatever that is called), and lateral raises.   Don't really do legs because I don't enjoy them and I am not that bothered about them, I workout for fun. My legs are in no way skinny but compared to my upper body yes they are behind.   Every exercises is around the same set and rep wise. I do around 3 sets per exercises and 8 reps. Sometimes I might add a 4th set for example Flat bench."
Brogress,2p0qwi,needmorecharact,2,Fri Dec 12 12:27:05 2014 UTC,"Diet wise: I don't count macros or anything like that. I am a Celiac which means I stay away from bread and anything containing gluten, I even have to avoid beer :(.  The only noticeable routine I have diet wise is eating 4 scrambled eggs in the morning and before bed. I almost only eat homecooked food.   The only supplement I take atm is creatine. I used to take protein powder when I started but honestly I feel like it's a waste of money."

Brogress,2ozpmq,MRSIII,9,Thu Dec 11 17:53:52 2014 UTC,"Everyone is asking how I did this in roughly three months.  The answer is wrestling season and cleaning up my diet a lot, and increasing my water intake.  I walk around at 145-147 pounds but have to make a weekly cut to 141.  Wrestling is very intense, and I can lose about 4 pounds in one hard practice.  I wrestle 5-6 days a week and lift 3-4.  I just injured my shoulder so I can't lift upper body for a while.  I was way stronger in the first picture but I'm a lot more athletic and healthy now."
Brogress,2ozpmq,the_lawlz_king,3,Thu Dec 11 19:28:36 2014 UTC,I was thinking about lifting after wrestling practice every once in a while but now I'm definitely convinced. Good work bro.

Brogress,2ozpmq,PedroIsWatching,13,Thu Dec 11 19:12:02 2014 UTC,It's a lot easier to go to the gym and lift than it is to maintain a good diet.

My sponsor says that once we get sober, nothing is a big deal anymore. I still think that birthdays are a big deal. Also, PR's. PR''s ARE a big deal.   On a side note, your bench is crazy high comparatively. Not sure if strong bench or weak squat/DL.   EDIT: I also started lifting in rehab. Great place to start."
Brogress,2ow2uy,johnny_gunn,3,Wed Dec 10 23:17:53 2014 UTC,"Congrats on 2 years! That's amazing. Working out is a great way to get back some of what we lost in addiction. I think that's why so many treatment programs set aside time for it.   As for the bench and squats. It's a little column A and a little column B. Since I've been lifting, bench has been my strength benchmark (pun kind of intended). I'm doing more squats and DL now because they're good whole body exercises, but I still just like the idea of being able to bench a lot more than my body weight. It's pretty satisfying to politely turn people down when they ask if I need a spot for 225 and then do a set of 10. Squats and DL don't me as excited as bench. Hopefully that will change when I start going up in weight though."
Brogress,2ow2uy,kev_jin,5,Thu Dec 11 02:12:07 2014 UTC,Solid gain. Any idea of you bf% throughout? I'm guessing 12-15 before and around 10 now?
Brogress,2ow2uy,johnny_gunn,3,Wed Dec 10 20:27:59 2014 UTC,"Thanks, man. I didn't check it during this period. As far as changes to BF are concerned, I started gaining a lot of weight when I went from the ""18 months ago"" picture to rehab. At the time of that photo, I weighed around 165. I was probably around 10% at the time.   When I went to rehab, I was a little over 190lbs, but I looked thin in the face. Here's a picture from 3 weeks before checking in. I was probably ~18-20% BF but it was all around my stomach.   If I were to guess, I'm probably between 10 and 12% now. I have visible abs without flexing and am fairly vascular. I'm hoping to get to 315 on bench press before the summer, so I'll probably gain some BF over the winter. I'll try to cut down to under 10% in the spring. My long term goal is to bench press twice my body weight, so I'm shooting for 350 at 175lbs."

Brogress,2onl77,FisherKing22,8,Tue Dec 9 13:01:24 2014 UTC,"Routine:  Has changed a lot. Had an injured AC joint last summer into the fall, so really just played around with whatever didn't hurt. A lot of pulling, hardly any pushing. Focused on squats and deadlifts. I'm now running a 13 week modified Sheiko program by Dave Tate. Started training for powerlifting this spring, hoping to compete in my first comp as a Raw Amateur at 181. Progress probably could be a lot better, but I'm in it for the long haul so I don't beat myself up about it. Hell, I'm in the best shape of my life so, who gives a fuck. I have good days, and bad days. If I'm not feeling so, I'll do all fluff and get a good pump going. I had a bad case of tendinitis start last January and took 2 months off. It's almost gone, but still flares up. This summer I injured my other AC joint (awesome), so bench has been slow again.  Diet: I really used MFP when I started last summer. I cut down from 180 to 157, and started bulking last fall. Have a good idea of what I'm eating everyday now, stays pretty consistent. Lots of cereal, oats, rice, chicken, veggies, shakes, some McDonalds. Usually eat pretty clean. Usually try to hit 2000 calories at the min, with 2500 being my usual number, and 3000 if I'm feeling crazy. I try to view my calories on a weekly basis, and don't sweat the day to day numbers. Protein is usually around 150 grams or higher, with lots of carbs and the remaining numbers going to fats.   Lifting Stats: Bench - 205 (was 135) Squat - 363.5 (was 215) Deadlift - 415 (was 295) So close to the 1000 pound club, which has always been my goal. My others were to hit a 2 plate bench, 3 plate squat, and 4 plate DL, which I've done minus the bench. So once I hit that 225 bench, I'll be at 1003.5.  Cheers!  Edit: Formatting"
Brogress,2onl77,FisherKing22,2,Mon Dec 8 16:06:17 2014 UTC,"Nice work, dude!   What do you do for chest? I have a similar height at 5'9 and weight at 180lbs, but my chest looks like your before photo even though my bench is a good bit higher than yours (275 compared to 205). Clearly you're doing something better than me. Or is your bench just artificially low because of the injury?"
Brogress,2onl77,ToMetric,2,Tue Dec 9 02:17:23 2014 UTC,"Thank you! I do nothing specific for my chest actually, but have been able to incorporate a number of exercises that didn't bother it. So when I couldn't bench at a heavy weight, I was still able to do incline dumbbell flys, so I'd hit those with 70lbs for low volume. I was able to do a ton of pull ups, weighted dips focusing on chest, still did higher volume bench press for more ROM and light weight. I did a lot of pendlay rows, and bent over rows of that nature.    Since the summer I've been incorporating dumbbell flys for 5x10 to almost every workout (3x a week) and that has made my moobs pop out. I really think I've made a lot of gains in my chest since July running this Sheiko program, only for the pure fact there is a ton of volume focusing on the chest/bench, the flys, dips, and heavy DLs.  Hope that helps.   edit: clarification"

Brogress,2omin8,bigw86,2,Mon Dec 8 07:00:09 2014 UTC,"Diet: I eat whatever I have really. I never really buy sugar filled junk food, so it doesn't really get into my diet. When I first started really eating more, I used MyFitnessPal to make sure I hit my goal of 3200 calories every day. I've recently stopped counting, I seem to have gotten pretty good at eating enough without it. Also I began using Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass at the beginning and am still using it. I love the stuff.   Some more specific aspects of my diet:   started out doing GOMAD, now I pretty much do half GOMAD (I love Milk)  Breakfast: If I'm in a hurry, I'll just down half a serving of SM blended with 2.5cups of whole milk. 1000 cals easy.      If I'm not in a hurry, I like to eat some Greek yogurt, 4/5eggs, 3 strips turkey bacon, and a bowl of cereal.   Lunch: PB&J/Totinos Pizza Rolls/granola bars with lots of milk/grilled chicken burritos maybe. These are just some of the things I might eat for lunch on a given day.   Dinner: Ground turkey burritos/chicken/more milk/ whatever is in the fridge   I often use SM as a meal replacement.   Routine: 100% bodyweight. I've been following the programs laid out in Mark Lauren's YAYOG. I should probably step into the gym at some point, especially considering there is a Gold's right next door. But I can't really figure out what routine I want to do. I don't think SS would be the most optimal for me, I'm looking for a more hypertrophy based routine. Perhaps a bro-split, but I would have no clue how to begin building a routine. I have never lifted seriously before."
Brogress,2omin8,bigw86,2,Mon Dec 8 07:18:29 2014 UTC,"Damn man, for only bodyweight work you look pretty good. Did you have any issues with doing GOMAD? I'm thinking of starting it but have never had that much milk so not sure how it'll react with me. I do drink milk though from time to time and eat ice cream like a mother, pizza etc. so I do have a ton of dairy so I'm not lactose intolerant but not sure how a gallon of milk will do me. I'm probably going to buy some lactose pills just incase.   I need to just get my ass out, do the necessary meal planning and start this crap. I'm 28 and 180 and look like Christian Bale from that movie where he was super skinny, I forget what it was called... (The Machinist or something perhaps?) Anyway, great progress and I might  suggest SL 5x5 and put on more weight until like March or so then cut for the summer and you'd look sick."
Brogress,2omin8,bigw86,2,Mon Dec 8 07:34:36 2014 UTC,"Thanks dude. As far as GOMAD goes, I didn't experience that many ill effects. I maybe was more prone to breaking out than before. When puberty hit I never really suffered through terrible acne. Although I have a friend who also was doing GOMAD at the same time as me, and his skin did not take it very well. Keep in mind that we are both 19, puberty is still doing its thing.   And hey man, believe me when I say I know that feel. Look at the first picture, I was incredibly skinny. That is how I have looked my entire life up until this point. After my tonsil surgery, I lost even more weight. Once I was recovered enough I decided it was time to put some fucking weight on my frame. Once I downloaded MyFitnessPal, it was so easy to gain the weight! I look and feel so much healthier now. I visited home for Thanksgiving (I'm a college student) and people did not recognize me. It felt great. If you decide to start putting on some weight, I wish you the best of luck. Some days it can feel like a chore to eat so much, but most days I just love eating."

No thanks!"
Brogress,2omin8,durium,2,Mon Dec 8 17:24:09 2014 UTC,"Ah gotcha. I got mine ""fixed"" when I was 14, so 11 years ago. They took me out of physical education and wanted me to get a rolley backpack which would have been social suicide back then.  I've had complications with my surgery since then and have been progressing my lifts very cautiously. I went to go see someone about the complications considering I had no idea if I was fine or was about to die (my sternum/front chest wall area would make weird popping/cracking noises and then i'd feel a slight pain a day later. He said I was fine and offered to put a titanium plate in me to ""hold everything together"" or I could just move on, try lifting, and see how it goes. I might have to go back for a second opinion lol.  The surgery I got was the most invasive one with the upside-down ""Y"" scar but I remember them telling me I'd be ok to go back to PE after 6 months even with the bar in. Maybe ask around and see if there are other options because I know there are less invasive surgeries nowadays (which is crazy, it's only been 11 years!).  Mine was pretty bad so I had no problem getting rid of my ""dent."" I was extremely self-concious of it at all times. It sucks that I'm having complications but I know my 14 year old self would be happy for my decision."
Brogress,2omin8,Jimmy_the_destroyer,2,Mon Dec 8 17:53:34 2014 UTC,"Bummer about the issues post-surgery. I hope all turns out well for you.   During high school I was extremely self-conscious of the ""bump"" or ""dent"" (mine is a little bit of both). I would hate it when people made comments about it; it really bothered me. After graduating I really just stopped worrying about it. If someone asked me what it was, I would let them know and just brush it off. Now with the weight that I've put on, it looks much better. I'm really glad I didn't go through with the surgery."
Brogress,2omin8,Jimmy_the_destroyer,1 point,Mon Dec 8 18:22:30 2014 UTC,"It's hard to even tell you have pectus excavatum in your recent photos. Great job, especially in only 3.5 months.  I have the opposite form, pectus carinatum. Whereby my sternum protrudes outwards, fortunately nothing anywhere near as severe as you see on a google image search though.   I was also offered the surgery, probably the same one you were offered (ravitch procedure). It's very invasive and a nurse told a story of how one patient got an infection and now lives their life in pain. I said no thanks and then bought a power rack.  Bodybuilding for 9 months has reduced its appearance massively. From a front profile its hard to even notice. And It's completely unnoticeable under any shirt or vest no matter how tight. Which is in stark contrast to how it was.  You definitely made the right decision and the progress you have made is excellent. And at least we will never have any problems with motivation."
Brogress,2omin8,Jimmy_the_destroyer,1 point,Sat Dec 13 11:09:20 2014 UTC,Great to hear from someone else that it's hard to tell I have pectus. Best thing for me is that it's much harder to notice from a side-view.   Here's to hoping it improves even more as I keep putting the work in. Cheers.

If you want any specific tips you need to list out what you eat, what you do, etc.   ...and then if I may be a lecherous homo for a second and add:  5) Don't lose fat and instead post naked pictures to the male equivalent of gonewild /r/ladybonersgw because I love builds like yours.

Started with a typical bro split doing 3x8 mostly.  Once I stopped making progress moved to a 5x5. Recently started Oly lifting to keep things interesting.  I'm mostly trying to gain strength and skills (oly/gymnastics) now that I'm pretty happy with how I look.  Diet is eat everything I can. I would definitely consider myself a hard gainer,  but it's probably because I'm not strict enough with my diet.  As far as supplements-just vitamins and pre-workout. I drink kefir instead of protein shakes."

Brogress,2oi1qk,BTBLAM,2,Thu Dec 18 03:43:46 2014 UTC,"Thanks! I know i was pretty lucky with my genetics all around (imo). Abs have always been the same few exercises for me. All done for 3 sets of 12. Sorry for the huge explanation, but the details are the important part.   1 is always leg lifts. Hanging from a bar, in the top of the dip position, holding yourself at the top of a chin up - all different positions to change the way leg lifts hit your abs. Start with bending your knees up as far as you can, then put a weight between your feet,  then do it with straight legs. Always controlling the negative.   2 cable crunches - making sure you let your whole back extend at the top to get a good stretch in your abs.   3 standing oblique crunches - hold a weight in one hand (30 - 45lbs usually) and the other behind your head bend as far as you can on the weight side so you feel a stretch,  then go as far as you can on the other side."
Brogress,2oi1qk,BTBLAM,2,Thu Dec 18 04:29:33 2014 UTC,"Dont be sorry man, thats EXACTLY what I needed, I just didnt want to swamp you with questions, youre a cool guy man, appreciated.  Leg lifts is the only exercise I dont do for abs, im going to implement it asap;   also did you say always in 3 sets of 12 reps, how do you feel about higher rep ranges? For some reason no matter where I look its always supposed to be 15+ reps for abs, I never liked it either, feels like im just training for endurance when i need those things to grow!"
Brogress,2oi1qk,Froyo_bro,2,Thu Dec 18 15:05:55 2014 UTC,"I'm glad it was helpful!  You will not get blocky abs doing high reps.  Train your abs the way you train anything else.  You want your chest to grow?  Heavy bench pressing is going to do a lot more than a shit load of push ups. It's a very common misconception.  Not that high reps are bad,  they just won't have the same effect.  I never go over 12 reps when I train abs."

Brogress,2o16xf,asljkdfhg,1 point,Tue Dec 2 10:17:35 2014 UTC,Any reason why you decided to not do cardio towards the end of the cut?
Brogress,2o16xf,Hereitcums,3,Tue Dec 2 23:54:24 2014 UTC,Lack of time / motivation
Brogress,2o16xf,Crookmeister,1 point,Wed Dec 3 08:26:15 2014 UTC,I feel ya. Cutting at 1800kcal is hard for me and I'm 155lbs 5'7. Can't imagine how shitty that is for someone of your stature
Brogress,2o16xf,NookieNinjas,1 point,Wed Dec 3 08:47:06 2014 UTC,155.0 lbs = 70.31 kg

Brogress,2o16xf,sevoque,3,Wed Dec 3 16:43:40 2014 UTC,Wow incredible. How did your lifts change throughout your cut?
Brogress,2o16xf,gatsby365,3,Tue Dec 2 11:52:22 2014 UTC,"They went up in the beginning, I think about 5-10% weight increase in the first 2 months. After that lifts stagnated and weights stayed the same until the end."

Added 10kg to my total for 372.5kg (821lbs) at 70.9kg (156lbs) body weight - Wilks: 367.36.   I followed an IIFYM diet, generally with very little cardio.

Brogress,2nyqyl,Chevellephreak,8,Tue Dec 2 04:33:17 2014 UTC,"Nice. I read the report and was impressed, but seeing the photo hit me harder. It made me think of all the people I've seen at meets again and again, which got me thinking, ""Is that the same girl as 3 months ago? She just did that? Whaaaa?!"" Anyway, I'm a visual learner, I guess.   Now that I see the pictures, it makes sense that your bench would be struggling. You are much smaller now, and even if your technique got a lot better, your leverages and ROM are significantly different and less advantageous. Maintaining your bench like you have with that much loss in mass over just a few months is no joke, imho. Once you get to a BW that you're happy with and can eat at or above maintenance for a while, you should see bench inprovements, even without changing your programming, imo."

Brogress,2nyqyl,skeach101,3,Mon Dec 1 21:52:23 2014 UTC,"Great progress! Just curious, do you still row(saw in your history)? And if so do you find it helps or hurts powerlifting? I used to row and have been doing bodybuilding style workouts for years. I found that during season my cardio was great but my strength kind of plateaued."
Brogress,2nyqyl,MakesMyPantsTight,2,Mon Dec 1 22:48:50 2014 UTC,"I don't row anymore. I hopped on the erg for a couple cardio sessions at one point just for kicks lol. Ideally now I can maintain my weight with minimal cardio before any big meet. I don't mind having improved cardio fitness though, and I feel healthier than I did at 180lbs. But before a meet I'd rather save my energy for lifting."
Brogress,2nyqyl,SmallOrange,2,Mon Dec 1 22:53:48 2014 UTC,"lol I sometimes hop on the erg for a warmup on back day or for some quick cardio, but I never row 1000s of meters like we used to do in practice. That makes sense. I do cardio once or twice a week just to stay in good cardiovascular shape, but I feel that lifting improves my cardio fitness enough."
Brogress,2nyqyl,SmallOrange,10,Mon Dec 1 23:29:34 2014 UTC,Exactly. Cardio is anything over 6 reps. haha

Brogress,2nyqyl,shiningdays,2,Tue Dec 2 05:57:23 2014 UTC,I would love to hear more about what you did. I am currently in the high 170's and want to cut down to about 150. It's crazy that you did this in 3 months. Did you do an aggressive cut on calories and a ton of lifting? Did you have to sacrifice any strength gains?
Brogress,2nyqyl,pilotoatomico,2,Tue Dec 2 00:32:16 2014 UTC,"I followed an IIFYM (if it fits your macros) plan that was made by a nutrition coach. The weight dropped slowly for the first 6 weeks because I basically sucked at hitting my macros lol. I decided 6 weeks ago to compete in this meet so I became a lot better at tracking and being accountable for it. Calories decreased gradually. I also did 3 lifting workouts/week (following the Sheiko 3 day program) and cardio as indicated by my coach.   Overall simple, but not easy. Having a coach that knew my goals was great because I could trust they would get me there without me having to stress over it."
Brogress,2nyqyl,hyperking,2,Tue Dec 2 00:43:03 2014 UTC,Awesome! I am following an IIFYM group for women on facebook and thought about getting my numbers done professionally by a coach. I just haven't wanted to pay for it lol. I am lifting 3-4 times a week but would like to embark on a cut.   Having your progress in 3 months is amazing. I am inspired.
Brogress,2nwkk5,BigBilbobaggins,11,Mon Dec 1 03:15:19 2014 UTC,"As for a bit more detail, I focused mainly on getting a high protein intake diet. A lot of grilled burgers and Carnivor protein powder. Other supplements used were Secret Sauce from muscle meds, ON BCAA, ON Creatine, and now ON Protein powder. I don't have a gym near me, so I'm limited to a set of 50 lb adjustable dumbbells and a small bench. Pretty much everything I do is with those weights, outside of a couple P90x workouts. For a while I rotated between workouts 5 times a week, now I've slowed to 3 times a week. Looking to start back up 5 times at the end of December again. Spent my entire life very thin, and struggled to put on muscle, so it was nice to finally see some results!"
Brogress,2nwkk5,swolebro420,20,Mon Dec 1 03:20:03 2014 UTC,"You struggled all your life to put on muscle but added ~30 lbs of it in 7 months with adjustable dumbbells? What is your routine? Those are some puberty-level gains. Great work, man."
Brogress,2nwkk5,nandoschickenwings1,7,Mon Dec 1 05:00:29 2014 UTC,Can you gain 30lbs of actual muscle (not fat) in 7 months naturally? Just asking because I've read quite a few times on some subreddits that you can only pack on like 2lbs a month maximum or something like that.
Brogress,2nwkk5,timesnewboston,4,Mon Dec 1 05:20:50 2014 UTC,"prob not, but 8 pounds glycogen + a little fat + a little muscle you're up 30 pounds"
Brogress,2nwkk5,theflyingvs,2,Mon Dec 1 05:41:59 2014 UTC,5 lb of water from creatine
Brogress,2nwkk5,Massena,6,Mon Dec 1 08:03:47 2014 UTC,"I mean, from the pictures it does look like he gained quite a lot of muscle. Attributing it to glycogen + fat + water makes it sound like this isn't really impressive."
Brogress,2nwkk5,theflyingvs,1 point,Mon Dec 1 19:04:43 2014 UTC,"its insanely impressive, i was just saying look more at the photo instead of the weight. You can clearly see awesome trap, delts, pec growth."
Brogress,2nwkk5,PowerDuffer,1 point,Tue Dec 2 02:23:10 2014 UTC,Mind if I ask you to fill in a beginner about what you mean by glycogen weight gain?
Brogress,2nwkk5,timesnewboston,1 point,Sat Dec 6 22:21:12 2014 UTC,"Okay a non-technical explanation, as I understand it. Glycogen is the energy stored in your muscles. It's not fat, it's more directly availabe. When you're in a cut, there isn't much glycogen in your muscles. So when you start a cut after a bulk, you may lose 8 lbs your first week, but it doesn't mean you lost 8 lbs of fat, just that your glycogen stores are lower"
Brogress,2nwkk5,PowerDuffer,1 point,Sun Dec 7 22:20:18 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback.   Since I posted, a little googling revealed we have--total--just a few pounds of glycogen in our bodies (unless you're obese). And most of it is in your liver.   I think there's a little confusion here."
Brogress,2nwkk5,timesnewboston,1 point,Sun Dec 7 22:32:23 2014 UTC,"Hmm maybe I misunderstood what I read about. I know whenever I switch from surplus to defecit, or vice versa, I swing 10 pounds in the first 10 days or so, then it really slows down to about -2 lbs a week for cut and +.7 pounds for bulk."
Brogress,2nwkk5,K-LAWN,4,Mon Dec 8 00:25:39 2014 UTC,"I was fairly random with the routine, the only thing routine about it was I would make sure I worked out at least 5 times a week. A lot of bench pressing, wide flys, push ups for my chest. Curls, reverse curls, lying triceps press/ Unfortunately I don't have a pullup bar either, so I did a lot of bent over barbell rows, dumbbell shrugs, one arm dumbbell rows. The P90x Leg and back routine was a standard, along with Ab Ripper X about 3 times a week (only 15 minutes, but decent). When I put on my most weight, I wasn't even taking Creatine yet. I was using Musclemeds Carnivor (which technically has creatine in it), Musclemeds Beef Aminos, and Musclemeds Secret Sauce which has a horrible name, but seems to work great. I rotated through pre workouts but most made me feel sick about 40 minutes into the workout, so I tried to stay away from them when I could and just have a coffee and banana before. My nutrition was a huge part of this too. A lot of lean beef, almonds, cottage cheese, special k protein cereal, builder bars, and a large increase in my water intake."
Brogress,2nwkk5,GynosTheNewLipo,3,Mon Dec 1 11:22:38 2014 UTC,Good work. Are all your lifts just upper body? I'd highly recommend investing in a squat rack.
Brogress,2nwkk5,PowerDuffer,3,Mon Dec 1 03:22:14 2014 UTC,"Thanks. I'd love to get something like that setup, but its just finding the room for it right now. With two kids my house has been overrun with toys. Pretty much all of my leg workouts have been p90x. The year before I started lifting I did a lot of running, so my legs had a bit of a head start. But as far as putting on gains in my legs, it has been a struggle."
Brogress,2nwkk5,Deathstrokecph,2,Mon Dec 1 03:30:17 2014 UTC,Check out split squats-- you do them with one dumbbell and they're killer.
Brogress,2nwkk5,tbends,1 point,Mon Dec 1 04:46:38 2014 UTC,"When you say ""a lot of burgers,"" you mean hamburgers without bun, right? Did you count your macro's? If so, share your average?  Great work man. (And ignore the juice trolls giving you a hard time.)"
Brogress,2nwkk5,Heavyonthesarcasm,1 point,Sat Dec 6 22:41:04 2014 UTC,"Thanks! Correct, just the burger, no bun. I would have 2 each day at lunch, but mixed it up from time to time with Reds steak Burritos. They had 29 g of protein per serving, and are fairly inexpensive. I didn't keep track of macros, my wife does, and tried getting me to as well, but I basically stuck to the same meals and snacks. Burgers, chicken, cottage cheese, yogurt, almonds , hummus, rice cakes with peanut butter, and banana before each workout. The fact that I never got strict with my nutrition in the past was probably why I never saw results before. Once I got in the routine, I loved every minute of it! Never really had cravings for Doritos or soda anymore, which was nice."
Brogress,2nwkk5,BoX_xedUp,3,Sat Dec 6 22:54:26 2014 UTC,Just for your own sake you should take a afterphoto with the same lightning (front) instead of the overlight. It'll make future comparisons even better.
Brogress,2nwkk5,ChickenMcVincent,2,Mon Dec 1 07:30:36 2014 UTC,"Agreed. Unfortunately I didn't plan ahead with the before shot, probably expecting to have the same results I always had. I went a bit overkill on the after shot by setting up my studio lights and backdrop."
Brogress,2nwkk5,davidthecoolman,2,Mon Dec 1 11:30:57 2014 UTC,He's saying you should take an after shot with the same lighting. Even if it isn't ideal it would show your progress better.

Brogress,2nwkk5,dssssd,4,Mon Dec 1 04:57:00 2014 UTC,kinda looks like you did some touch ups to your after pic
Brogress,2nwkk5,dssssd,16,Mon Dec 1 07:32:55 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately I didn't use any lighting on the 'before' shot, but did on the after. Makes it seem a bit more drastic because of that. I do photography as a side hobby/job, so I have studio lights and whatnot which makes for a much better photo. Good eye!"
Brogress,2nwkk5,dssssd,6,Mon Dec 1 11:25:06 2014 UTC,"35, lots of new muscle....what sort of special sauce are we talking here?"

Brogress,2nwkk5,ChickenMcVincent,7,Tue Dec 2 04:21:08 2014 UTC,"I had to google that to get what that meant. Unless they are sneaking it in supplements these days, I wouldn't go near steroids. The whole reason I started lifting was to get healthy for my 2 and 4 year old, not compromise my health with something like that."
Brogress,2nwkk5,theredcandy,2,Tue Dec 2 11:25:12 2014 UTC,It's cool I don't have anything against roids. I think this kind of progress for you age over that short period of a time is highly unlikely. Either your lying about the time frame or that's not the weight it was 7 months ago but maybe the last time you weighed your self which could've been along time ago. Either was you still did a good job roids or not.
Brogress,2nwkk5,cynicalMIND,3,Wed Dec 3 02:55:58 2014 UTC,"I'm really not sure what TRT is to be honest.  I did list all the supplements I was using during the 7 month time frame, but it sounds like you're taking about something else. The 7 month time frame started back in March after I took my kids on a trip to Disney, and saw the video and photos of myself once I got back. That kind of jump started my obsession with lifting."
Brogress,2nwkk5,ELEMENTALITYNES,2,Wed Dec 3 03:03:28 2014 UTC,You should be so embarrassed for yourself
Brogress,2nwkk5,Work-After,2,Wed Dec 3 03:18:29 2014 UTC,For implying he must be on steroids.
Brogress,2nwkk5,beta-fish,0,Sat Dec 6 01:45:28 2014 UTC,"So to you, this kid is definitely on gear. I don't see how it's about me ""not knowing about steroid use."" What does that have to do with anything? I know about natural lifting, and I know enough to say what he did is not that remarkable for a natural. Good yes, ""definitely on steroids,"" no way."
Brogress,2nwkk5,PhoKingGr8,0,Sat Dec 6 02:47:02 2014 UTC,"I don't know that I would call a 35 year old man a kid, first off. Second, please please show me another example of someone going from chubby with no muscle to having capped delts, striations, and vascularity in seven months naturally at the point their body has already started to decrease testosterone production.  If this dude was 18, I would be more inclined to buy it. 35? Nope."
Brogress,2nwkk5,PhoKingGr8,3,Sat Dec 6 02:53:14 2014 UTC,"I give you credit for your conviction on this, but you're wrong. I know by me saying ""I don't use steroids"" doesn't change anything in your mind, and the reality is it doesn't really matter what you believe. The sad thing is you really believe it's something that is impossible to achieve at 35. Looking at your past post history, it looks like you yourself are into using steroids, so it would be understandable why you would think it's the reason for my results."
Brogress,2nwkk5,Matt08642,2,Sat Dec 6 03:08:13 2014 UTC,"I would say reality is the reason for my belief in your results, but you are welcome to think as you like. Your changes are still fantastic, natural or not. Please don't feel like I'm trying to take that away from you."
Brogress,2nwkk5,Collected1,2,Sat Dec 6 03:23:13 2014 UTC,"Let it go, dude.   If he was about this big, but ripped and super dry, I'd see why you'd be this obsessed. The dude has a noticeable amount of fat, shaved his torso, took a picture with good lighting, and looks oiled up or something. Also, this could well be what he looks like with a pump."

Brogress,2nur8h,Molinkintov,3,Sun Nov 30 19:03:49 2014 UTC,"I did a Layne Norton type program where I tried to figure out what I was eating currently, which I deemed was around 3000  calories and then I took some off little by little from there.

Brogress,2nur8h,Jollywog,2,Sun Nov 30 19:17:14 2014 UTC,For how long did you stay at 1850cal? And how often did you drop the calories?
Brogress,2nur8h,dead_ed,2,Mon Dec 1 09:17:20 2014 UTC,"I didn't stay at 1850 for very long. This was my first serious cut that I would say I actually knew what I was doing so I tried to lose 1-1.5 lbs a week. So if I wasn't losing quick enough I would drop calories. I want always 100% strict with my macros though so I ended up dieting for a lot longer than I should've because I had some set backs. Because of this, I never got quite as cut as I wanted to but overall it was a good learning experience."

My new routine is start off by benching,squatting,deadlifting, or OH pressing heavy, then moving on to isolation for whatever muscle I feel like targeting that day. I usually try to incorporate light arm work in every other day but I find it to be rather boring so I tend to ignore arms every now and then."

For awhile I was doing smolov on squat and deadlift but it got to a point where I literally couldn't walk after lifting so that ended quickly. I just try to do doubles and triples somewhere within 90% of my max weight and bench, squat, dead and OH press. Everything else I just do for some isolation, I don't really have a set routine after my heavy lifts."

That being said, for 3 years in you should be a lot bigger. And also I don't believe you are 180lbs at 6 foot. I'm 6'2"" 180lbs and I have a lot more muscle mass than you and I'm just as lean (roughly 8% bodyfat, I'm an ectomorph as well). Your progress is looking great and it sounds like you're doing it right (I.E. Eating a lot, eating clean, doing compound exercises) which is all awesome bro  All I'm saying is I feel your numbers are a little exaggerated. But again, overall great progress.  Edit: I'm an idiot and didn't see you were 16 that would make sense you're not as big after 3 years like I was (I'm 20) but I still don't think you're 180lbs when you're that lean."

Introduce a weighted barbell now and still focus on that tension. When you get to the end of the range of motion (ROM) you squeeze the muscle as hard as you can, forcing blood into it.   The difficulty is apply the same process to muscle that you can't easily tense. Just takes some practice. Mind muscle contraction I think they call it.  Hope this helps a little."

Brogress,2no6sv,PohFahVoh,5,Sun Nov 30 13:01:09 2014 UTC,"From the article:   There’s a fundamental concept in the science of muscle physiology called the “length tension relationship,” which refers to how much force a muscle can generate relative to its length. As numerous studies have shown, muscles exhibit the highest force output when working from somewhere between fully elongated (stretched) and fully shortened (contracted). Simply put, for every exercise you use to get bigger, stronger or faster, your muscles exert maximum force in the middle range of a rep. Additionally, the more force you generate within this “mid range,” the more motor units you recruit, which means you’ll be bringing more muscle into the game.   He brings up basic physiology relating to length tension relatonship to back up the point about how his new exercise is 'the best'. The truth is that these things are far, far more complex than that. The only thing the author does is give the impression that he knows what he's talking about because he uses big words. He might even have a point in saying that constant tension is a good for hypertrophy, but putting our your half baked theories of how it all hangs together proves nothing. Typical bro science."

Not sure if I'm allowed to mention where I got my routine from (if considered advertising), but I'm using the Aworkoutroutine beginner routine.

You can do romanian deadlifts, it works the hamstrings like crazy so you shouldnt real feel it in your back too much. I would recommend you to do something other than this routine tho. Why do a mix of bodysplit routine and powerlifting, i mean if i look at the ratios here, Your doing a bunch of rowing and pressing and abs, your gonna develop imbalances from your shoulders and pecs being stronger than your mid-back. Id add in a lot of face-pulls, band pull aparts and some YWL´s to balance it out, your body composition will favour more volume anyway."

Brogress,2na7we,zYwi3c,24,Mon Nov 24 18:59:59 2014 UTC,"Complete overhaul of the diet, cut all the shit and went low carb/high protein and also did leangains.com intermittent fasting eating plan. Started off with Insanity, purely cardio and low carb to strip some fat and get me off my ass. After 2 months I introduced weight training and built up from there with the odd cardio here and there. Diet isn't a diet anymore, it's just how it is. Yes I do legs before it gets mentioned haha, I'm up to 310lbs for 10 on squats but it's a small gym, ran out of weights... they're getting more in."
Brogress,2na7we,nephilis,3,Mon Nov 24 19:07:23 2014 UTC,dude you are a massive inspiration. you give me hope i can get to sub 200lb mark.  I'm like 238. Strong as an ox from lots of gym time and weights but so much belly fat when i'm not getting a pump at the gym doesn't look great.  been doing pure cardio days for the last 3 weeks to start tackling all that underlying visceral fat
Brogress,2na7we,picbandit,3,Tue Nov 25 01:49:54 2014 UTC,"Fantastic, keep up the hard work! I found in the beginning that I could cut my calories quite a bit and get my energy from my fat stores and just keep going. Some days I'd do a 16km cycle then do 1.5hrs of weight training afterwards. You can do it!"
Brogress,2na7we,modernbenoni,2,Tue Nov 25 08:08:20 2014 UTC,Awesome. Do you still IF? Hows your carb intake at the moment?
Brogress,2na7we,Deathstrokecph,8,Mon Nov 24 20:00:40 2014 UTC,"I do Insanity on the days I can't make it to the gym, maybe once or twice a week. Carbs are still low but not super strict, I don't eat bread, rice, potatoes, pasta etc... probably a crap diet but it works for me and I find it easy to stick to. I don't have cheat days, I have random treats instead, a cookie with my coffee, chocolate shake after a heavy workout etc."

Brogress,2na7we,beefyliltank,3,Tue Nov 25 11:08:40 2014 UTC,"I worked in a slaughterhouse for 5 years, I left that to work in an office and that's when I piled the weight on. I'd been there for 10 years, so I was more or less getting fatter over that 10 year period. I hadn't done any serious lifting, was just casual gym stuff maybe twice a week which was off and on again, but nothing substantial at all.  I don't have a spotter or a gym buddy so haven't quite tested my 1 rep max. Bench press I'm at 110kg for 5, squat 140kg for 10 but there's no weights left to add, deadlift 150kg for 5. Just now I'm doing a tricep/incline dumb bell chest press superset. Again I'm limited by what my small local gym has, the dumb bells only go to 25kg. I'll do 10 skull crushers with 20kg DB's then straight into 10 chest press with 25kg, repeat 3x. Drop the skull crusher dumb bells down to 18kg but keep the chest to 25kg,do 15 skull crushers and 15 chest press 3x with, drop down again and 20/20, drop again and do 25/25, drop again and do 30/30 doing 3 sets per drop... works out to 600 rep total.  I'll jump on seated row do an iron marathon 1 rep, then 2, then 3... up to 20, works out to 210 reps total, minimum 10 sec rest between. It's silly resistive bands so not sure the weight, may only be 50kg at very most.  I'll hop on bench and start at 55kg (40 on the plates and that bar is 15) for 10, keep adding 10kg each set till I reach max weight, I then drop back to 55kg and 10 and 10, so 10 reps and 10 sec rest, repeat until exhaustion. Drop 10kg to 45 and repeat 10 and 10 till I can't finish, drop one more time to 35kg and this time to 30 reps and 10 sec rest till exhuastion.  I'll then finish off with 21's on curls and close curl with kettle bell, nothing too heavy at this point. 25kg on the EZ for 21s then straight to a 24kg kettle bell for 10 close grip curls.  That's an average workout. I mix and match, have dedicated shoulder days, decline rows and leg days, but a lot of the time I just have to take what I can get as it's a really small gym with not much space... 3 people on the weights and there's no room for anyone else. Sorry it's sporadic, I more or less just made it all up as I went along."

The first picture was in the summer of 2009 right after Air Force basic training so we were really doing more cardio and calisthenics. The second one was in the summer of 2011 about six months after a deployment where I started lifting (on and off with plenty of cheat meals)   The last picture was taken last night. I've gotten serious about lifting around the beginning of 2012 and started going to the gym religiously, but with a diet of hot pockets, microwaveable taquitos, pizza etc. It wasn't until 2013 where I realized that you can't out work the diet and started eating better and leaning out more."

On my heavy days (legs and days I do deadlifts) I'll have a serving of fruit about 30min-one hour before the workout. The rest of the week is all just meat and veggies, particularly cauliflower rice. Make sure to hydrate too!   Monday: Legs Tuesday: Back, bis, and obliques  Wednesday: Shoulders, tris, and abs Thursday: Cardio Friday: Chest, obliques, and abs Sat and Sun: Rest days but I try and stick to the diet and allow myself 1-3 cheat meals  I also ensure that I do squats, deadlifts, and overhead press within the week because I like them compound exercises"

Brogress,2n0lz6,TatdGreaser,1 point,Sat Nov 22 13:08:19 2014 UTC,I'd feel pretty lazy only going three days a week just because I can only dedicate an hour a day to it except on Saturdays.

Brogress,2n0lz6,Russz,1 point,Sat Nov 22 00:15:27 2014 UTC,"Ah Ok I see. I used to do like 2 hours a day each time. But the problem was that I didn't follow a program, so while I made decent progress in some lifts and endurance exercises, I stalled fairly quick on my strength gains.   Doing a bit of SL now..past few weeks were fucked, but today had a great gym day and overall great week. I might switch to MadCow soon simply because I'm not exactly a novice anymore and SL is only cutting it for so long."

Brogress,2n1fij,eradicati0nx,5,Sat Nov 22 06:46:26 2014 UTC,Workout schedule is pretty straightforward - 2 days on 1 day off legs - chest & tris - back & bis - shoulders calves and abs - Towards the end you start mixing it up.   Food wise I was super strict. Breakfast lunch and dinner was 1 cup egg whites + 1 cup steamed vegetables + 1 cup of brown rice/whole grain noodles/sweet potato + 1 - 1/2 cup baked chicken breast and would have 1 or 2 cheat meals per week but didnt go overboard when i did. Rice cakes for snacks throughout the day. Didn't take any supplements other than White Flood reborn for pre-workout and muscle milk for post

Brogress,2n1fij,BroomSIR,2,Sat Nov 22 18:24:40 2014 UTC,"I think people are getting upset because most people don't just show cuts here. They show the bulk part too. As others indicated the title implies a complete transformation, and we're missing the important half; otherwise it can go in /r/progress or whatever other diet-related sub  You look great. You're accomplishing a lot. Not so much brogress though as you obviously had your muscles when you started. Further proof it is hard to gain muscle mass while cutting."

Brogress,2mrx4w,ELEMENTALITYNES,1 point,Wed Nov 19 18:51:35 2014 UTC,I work at lifetime. They are working on replacing the removable keys with a combo lock that works with your card. They've been losing too much money on lost keys.
Brogress,2mrx4w,ChickenChaseur,0,Thu Nov 20 02:26:46 2014 UTC,"Oh shit my Lifetime has a completely different locker setup, and I didn't even notice OP's was only keys. Basically the way the lockers work at my lifetime, is essentially the ""lock"" is a little knob that when vertical, the lock is open, but when you twist it horizontally, it is closed. There are four little dials on the side of the knob, all going from 0-9. So you open the locker and put your stuff inside, close the locker door, then with the knob vertical, you change the four dials to a combination that you will remember. Then you turn the knob horizontally, locking the locker. When you mix up the dials to any combination that isn't the combination you initially set, the knob won't turn vertically again. The knob only opens when you turn the dials to the right combination. The lockers can also be opened by a key that only the maintenance workers have, so if you happen to forget the combination you set, you can just call a worker over to open your locker real quick."
Brogress,2mrx4w,ELEMENTALITYNES,1 point,Thu Nov 20 14:04:35 2014 UTC,Yup thats what All lifetimes are moving to. The older ones have a key that comes out when you put your card in it when you close and lock it. The key doesn't come out or move unless you put your membership card in it.

Brogress,2mj5r8,canofsodapop,2,Thu Nov 20 20:52:08 2014 UTC,Thanks! The benefit is that it's the fastest way to build lean mass. It becomes extremely hard to gain muscle while eating at maintenance after awhile so I bulk to make it easier to gain muscle. Then I cut to make sure I don't get too fat :)

Brogress,2mj5r8,Bstpitch,3,Mon Nov 17 19:15:39 2014 UTC,What was your diet n macros while bulking and cutting?
Brogress,2mj5r8,topps_chrome,6,Mon Nov 17 07:15:05 2014 UTC,"3500-4000 calories a day bulking. All clean foods. The only foods I eat are chicken breast, brown rice, eggs, wheat bread, broccoli, and peanut butter. I eat 2 lbs of chicken breast a day, 6 eggs, ton of broccoli, and filled the rest of the calories with carbs from wheat bread+rice, and fat from peanut butter.  When I'm cutting I just take my carbs really low, as low as 50g a day sometimes."
Brogress,2mj5r8,Bstpitch,3,Mon Nov 17 07:21:41 2014 UTC,How many calories do you have when cutting? Do you make up for the lack of carbs by upping protein and fat like a keto diet or do you carb cycle where you have high carb days like once a week?
Brogress,2mj5r8,kwunyurn,1 point,Mon Nov 17 13:31:27 2014 UTC,It all just depends how hard I want to cut and what my time frame is. Usually somewhere around 500 calories under maintenance. I don't up protein and fat to compensate nor do I have high carb days.
Brogress,2mj5r8,Marsinator,1 point,Mon Nov 17 15:34:23 2014 UTC,Damn 50g of carbs is killer. How often would you go that low carb during your cuts? And did you have any refeed days when cutting?
Brogress,2mj5r8,Sciar,1 point,Wed Nov 19 08:18:25 2014 UTC,"Just whenever cutting got really difficult. I did on occasion, but it was never planned. More of a keeping sanity thing. Perhaps once every 2 weeks or so."

Brogress,2mhsh4,gatsby365,1 point,Mon Nov 17 16:50:28 2014 UTC,"Thanks. I really attribute a lot of my progress from the summer - I was able to workout with a good friend of mine who has similar goals, fitness perspective, etc. and that helped a lot. We were consistently pushing each other and helping each other out.   That, combined with having a solid diet (nothing special like I said, but home cooking and high protein) are the main things I feel like were responsible for most of my progress."

Skinny guy here, and I'm just wondering if you could talk about how much $ you spent weekly/monthly on food, what resources you had to prepare it and what you ended up doing with it all.

TBH you really dont need a month before you start working out at all. At the gym you might feel self conscious but honestly nobody's judging you. just make sure to ask someone for help if you think your form is off or if you dont know what you're doing"
Brogress,2mcfav,mokarney,0,Sat Nov 15 19:37:42 2014 UTC,"Hey thanks a lot man. It's not a self consciousness thing, it's a fear that my body won't be able to do/build anything with the working out without stocking up first. Or that I'll make only bare minimum gains and won't derive enough motivation and pleasure out of that to keep up the hard work. But that diet guideline of yours is simple as anything and I'm going to start at home workouts while working on my diet now.   Appreciate your time dude."

So 1rm for squats stands at - 130kg (286lbs)  Bench - I only use dumbbells. Last time I did the bar, I comfortably pressed 100kg (220lbs). Like I said, I train on my own and burn the muscle out in other ways.  Deadlift - I rack pull. I'm 6ft3"" and pull conventionally and without the use of proper plates, the bar starts way to low.

Brogress,2m84kg,aether_nz,2,Fri Nov 14 00:18:57 2014 UTC,"/r/gainit can be considered a subset of /r/fitness, there is a lot of overlap. Although /r/gainit only contains posts relating to gaining lean mass whereas /r/fitness has many other sorts of posts as well."

I figure I'll probably restart the cycle as I'm seeing some good strength gains, but I've read that just restarting everything at once is a bit boring as you're lifting light for a few weeks.

If i skip 3-4 days my back gets so tight it kills. The gym is my physical therapy. But I havnt squatted at all since. Been trying to help stablize it with cable machine routines right now.

Brogress,2m0sqb,BobTheSwagjesus,2,Wed Nov 12 07:53:30 2014 UTC,"36 here as well with a full-time job and 2 kids.  36 really isn't that old when it comes to changing your physique.  I'm much stronger and more aesthetic now than when I was 19.  You've definitely made good progress in that time with noticeable muscle gains in your arms, shoulders, and chest.  I found the biggest change in my appearance came when I started really paying attention to my diet and started tracking macros.  I would recommend eating at a slight deficit (~1 lb per week) to shed some excess fat and uncover more of the muscle you've developed underneath.  You also may want to consider switching up your routine if you find yourself stalling on your lifts and you're passed the novice stage.  This upper/lower split has worked really well for me and fits in to my schedule since you can do it in only 3 or 4 days per week:  http://www.aworkoutroutine.com/the-muscle-building-workout-routine/    The key is consistency.  Keep it up!"
Brogress,2m0sqb,PhatsCockstrangla,2,Wed Nov 12 15:15:14 2014 UTC,"Thanks for commenting.  I agree that 36 really isn't that old...its just older than 90% /r/brogress posts. There is a guy at my gym that must be in his mid-60s and is the most ripped guy at the gym.   I'm bulking right now and don't really care if I get fatter. At my height it takes a huge amount of calories to put on weight and  progress in my lifts. Its much more practical for me to eat calories wherever I can then cut the weight off later, than to try to stay slim while making progress. I'd like to get to a 2-plate bench and a 3-plate DL before I worry about dropping any fat.   I consider myself done with SS which was why I decided to make the before/after picture now. I just switched to PHUL. I like it so far because I really prefer the strength aspect of lifting but with my long limbs I can use the hypertrophy days because vanity."
Brogress,2m0sqb,yardeni,1 point,Wed Nov 12 15:31:34 2014 UTC,We're pretty much equal on strength. You should be proud man! Keep working out and enjoy every minute. I'm sure it feels great to know you're getting stronger every day :)
Brogress,2m0sqb,radbitt,1 point,Thu Nov 13 19:40:52 2014 UTC,"Great job on the progress. Keep it up!  Your numbers are almost exactly the same as where I'm at right now, just my squat is a bit lower.

Brogress,2lzftd,Shotdownm,2,Tue Nov 11 20:13:20 2014 UTC,"I've actually been working out for about 10 years, but I really didn't start taking my nutrition seriously until 18 months ago.  As for me reaching my limit, I have tried everything from doing extremely heavy lifts (only 2-3 reps per set) and eating nearly double my estimated maintainable calories; all I gained was fat. Plus I am almost 30 years old now, I'm past my prime. I probably could gain a bit more muscle, but not a lot. I'm actually pretty happy with where I am right now. A bit more muscle would be nice, but I'm comfortable with how I look now."
Brogress,2lzftd,Shotdownm,8,Tue Nov 11 20:21:28 2014 UTC,Have you tried eating slighty over your maintance aka lean bulk and working out hard? I kind of really think that you are selling yourself short by saying this is genetic maximum.. Not even close..
Brogress,2lzftd,GynosTheNewLipo,2,Tue Nov 11 20:56:29 2014 UTC,"Yeah. I've tried that many, many times."
Brogress,2lzftd,Jollywog,2,Tue Nov 11 22:13:11 2014 UTC,"Okay you lets say you can't gain more muscle (Which I still don't fully believe) You can get leaner for sure by lowering your bodyfat% and therefor getting a better fat/muscle ratio, of which will improve how lean you are."

Brogress,2lzftd,Aquipy,1 point,Wed Nov 12 00:18:14 2014 UTC,What he is saying is its impossible to hit your genetic potential in such a short time. It will be very difficult but you are far from it. Its something like 5 years of solid regular work before you do. You said below in your post you didn't start doing nutrition right until 18 months ago. It's seriously 90% diet.

Brogress,2lyyos,Chiurazzik,1 point,Tue Nov 11 15:23:52 2014 UTC,"Thanks so much!  Preface: I was a complete novice to working out when I started and still am in many aspects, I feel that most of my results have stemmed changing my eating habits.  -The first 1.5 weeks, I started counting calories via myfitnesspal (I didn't even change the type of foods I ate, just the portions) and started walking in the evening during this period I lost about 5 lbs! I eventually started running only half a mile (I was too out of shape to do more) 2-3 weeks until I finally built up the endurance to run one full mile.  -1.5 months in,  I started I weight lifting (5 days a week) and running every single day (only 1-2 miles) AND I started following a Ketogenic diet (there's an awesome subreddit for it). I had a summer job that allowed me to afford eating chipotle every single day so I had the best dietary change ever. (REMEMBER: Diet=80% Exercise=20%) -Towards the end of the summer, I started an intermittent fast (which only helped me maintain weight because I turned 21 and started drinking excessively)  -THE REGRESS: Two weeks before school started, I had RA training so I had literally no time to work out or eat healthy (our meals were provided so I ate whatever was there). At the beginning of the semester our school opened a Chik-fil-A, and I started eating here twice a day (no lie)... this and the lack of readily available free time for exercise caused me to gain 15lbs. I refused to let my whole summer go to waste, so I slowly got back into the swing of things, adjusting to demands of college.   -September: I only worked 2 times a week during my weight training class doing whatever splits we had that day, and started doing midnight runs in training for a 10K -October: I made it my goal to run a minimum of how many days there were in a month (I exceeded this) and I also began intermittent fasting again. I eat one Massive ass meal Ketogenic meal in the caf a day. -November: Still intermittent fasting (I don't calories anymore) I try to do full body workouts 4 times a week and I run 2-4 miles every day . On the weekends I reward myself with one carb meal!  It has been a long and slow journey but I'm proud of my discipline and truly believe that if I can get this far, anyone else can too!   I typed this up super fast so it may seem disjunct. If you need any clarifications, please ask!"

Brogress,2lyyos,bro69,1 point,Tue Nov 11 17:30:26 2014 UTC,"To expound upon my diet. My one meal a day in our school's caf typically consists of  -2-3 cheese burger patties (no sauce, no bun). -Whatever type of chicken they have out (sometimes I'll get a little ranch on the side) -Dark veggies to get the minimum amount of carbs I need (mostly broccoli from the salad bar), some celery for fiber. -If they have pasta, I typically get whatever meat topping (no noodles) they have with that.  -and if I'm still hungry 2-3 more cheese burger patties ;) -and three glasses of water (minimum)  -I'm typically full all day after eating this much in one sitting :)   *I thoroughly support the notion that, if you have to go hungry when you change your dietary routine, then you're doing it wrong!

Brogress,2lpxy3,Redundant_Bot,81,Sun Nov 9 15:27:37 2014 UTC,Thanks! I've had the same routine for a couple years. I used to do olympic lifting but I have to many injuries now. I also try to run at least once a week. Day 1 - Chest & triceps Day 2 - back & biceps  Day 3 - legs & shoulders Day 4 - deadlifts & biceps Day 5 - off  I've never kept track of macros but i just make sure I get in atleast 3000 calories a day. If I start too get fat I cut back to 2000 calories a day for a few weeks. I think it works pretty good and it's easy. My cycle is just test cause it's cheap lol.

Brogress,2lip01,tristinGrind,6,Thu Nov 13 20:48:45 2014 UTC,"Are you taking supplements during your training. Besides vegan, whats your diet like?"
Brogress,2lip01,TarAldarion,11,Thu Nov 6 22:32:09 2014 UTC,"I start every day with a big fat smoothie - cup of oats, couple of bananas, rice milk, soy protein, kale or other greens, frozen fruit, and nut butter or coconut cream.  I eat as much as I can throughout the day without getting sick (and eating enough has easily been as much work as lifting, which I only do 3 days a week). Typically I have 4-6 medium sized meals a day. Mostly whole foods, plenty of stuff like lentils, rice, tempeh, though a couple days a week I have junk food in between meals. Gaining weight is very unnatural for me so I err on the side of too much rather than too little.  Soy protein was my only supplement until a week ago when I started taking creatine."
Brogress,2lip01,TheSurrealistTourist,4,Thu Nov 6 22:40:11 2014 UTC,Do you think being vegan is holding you back?
Brogress,2lip01,TheSurrealistTourist,6,Thu Nov 6 22:46:26 2014 UTC,Not at this point. I'm very happy with my gains so far and from looking around I'd say they're pretty good for any diet within this period of time. When I started out I told myself if I felt I wasn't progressing enough I'd start eating eggs but I've been pleasantly surprised at how it's gone.  I did recently start taking creatine though. There are a few disadvantages of a vegan diet and one is no dietary source of creatine.
Brogress,2lip01,reikou92,3,Thu Nov 6 22:55:53 2014 UTC,Im glad youre happy with the results. You look great for such a short period of time. Being new to lifting (I havent even started yet...)

Brogress,2lip01,interrobanginn,1 point,Thu Nov 6 23:26:43 2014 UTC,I think thats what draws me to it mostly. How much time are you spending in the gym a day with this?

Brogress,2lip01,rand486,1 point,Sat Nov 8 03:58:11 2014 UTC,"Nice progress dude! I'm an ovo-lacto vegetarian (trying to become vegan though) that just started Stronglifts this week. I just had a couple of questions for you. First off, how many calories are you taking in each day? What are some of the ""junk"" foods you eat? About how much do you spend on groceries a week? The foods you mentioned seem like they would run quite the bill. Do you attribute a lot of your success to the fact that you're eating whole foods rather than synthetic meats and starches such as pasta? Sorry about the bombardment of questions."
Brogress,2lip01,mechrock,2,Fri Nov 7 03:12:39 2014 UTC,"Actually a lot of my food is quite cheap - bulk lentils, oats, rice, bananas, veggies, etc. I do spend more on food than I did before though, even factoring in the fact that I eat out less. I just looked over my bank statement and it's probably about about 80-90 bucks a week though when I first started out (and was almost strictly eating the healthy stuff) it was easily 50 or less a week.  I attribute my success to lifting a lot and eating a lot. I had pasta and field roast today actually and it was fine, though I don't really like the fake meats and cheeses and whatnot that much these days. I guess I'm kinda being won over to the IIFYM thing, though for the most part if I'm doing extremely physically demanding activities my body craves nutritious foods so it kind of takes care of itself.  Oh and I'd say I probably eat around 3000 - 3500 calories a day."

Brogress,2lip01,TarAldarion,2,Thu Nov 6 23:43:51 2014 UTC,Well a significant portion of that for me is body fat. I'm as surprised as anyone but I believe if I can do it anyone can since I'm naturally very skinny as you can see in the before pics.   Just gotta lift big and eat big.
Brogress,2lip01,throwawayccc000,3,Fri Nov 7 00:28:40 2014 UTC,How much protein did you manage to intake everyday? I'm thinking about lifting myself.
Brogress,2lip01,elStoogeDR,2,Thu Nov 6 22:33:24 2014 UTC,"I don't really count macros or anything, but I do put 25 g soy protein in my smoothie every day along with nut butter and oats, have good whole foods protein sources throughout the day (lentils, tempeh, beans, etc.) and sometimes have a protein bar or something in between meals. So I get a decent amount but probably a lot less than other people I see on here."

Brogress,2lip01,Not_Hobbes,3,Fri Nov 7 03:49:31 2014 UTC,I'd say it fluctuates a bit but probably around 100 - 125. Any more than that feels unnecessary to me.
Brogress,2lip01,WolfgangPetry,-8,Fri Nov 7 05:50:44 2014 UTC,"Not saying you have to do this because obviously what you're doing is working for you, but a classic general rule of thumb for someone trying to put on mass is to eat 2g of protein for every pound of bodyweight. That's a bit of broscience , IMO.  However, studies have shown that novice bodybuilders should consume about 1g of protein per pound at least.   http://jap.physiology.org/content/73/2/767"
Brogress,2lip01,Jaytu,2,Fri Nov 7 06:37:34 2014 UTC,Almost everyone says 1g/lb. When people say two they are saying 2g/kg which is about the same as 1g/lb. And also he is getting between 62-78g/lb which is really fine.   http://bayesianbodybuilding.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/
Brogress,2lip01,ChickenChaseur,-1,Fri Nov 7 17:14:02 2014 UTC,"Thanks for that. I spew broscience, call it out to be broscience, recommend the 1g/lb, and downvotes rain down anyway. Probably should have left out that ""at least"" lol.   Since I have always had a hard time meeting my macros I found that if I aim for a higher goal (that golden gram/lb) I'm more apt to meet my macros than had I simply aimed for the .82g/lb.  In other words, when I'm training on a bulk, I ""try"" to eat 200g of protein a day knowing that I won't get anywhere close, which usually leaves me around 150-165g that I should be getting.   If some feel comfortable enough with counting their macros that they don't do that, then all the better for them.  tl;dr Different strokes for different folks"
Brogress,2lip01,redhotred,2,Fri Nov 7 18:44:06 2014 UTC,"I tried forcing higher protein intake in the beginning due to reading those kinds of things, but I found past a certain point I was not meeting my body's nutritional needs (by giving too much protein vs. other nutrients). Basically my idea is if it isn't broke don't fix it and then when things start to plateau I can reconsider those sorts of factors."

I decided to keep bulking and made a goal of 15 more lbs. It was pretty easy to be honest, kept relatively clean diet with cheat days here and there. Shortly after I made my first progress post I got terrible exertion headaches, took a month off lifting. After that I kept with a P/P/L routine until about 9 months in. I started 5/3/1 BBB 3 month challenge, which was okay. Honestly I didn't feel it was too hard til I got to month three. It truly is ""boring"" but 5 x 10 225lb Squats and D/L were crazy, and provided fun challenge. Felt like I made some strength gains but overall I like the P/P/L split better.   My estimated 1 RMs - OHP 170lbs (tested) Squat/DL around 360 lbs (did 3x5 320 squat yesterday), BP 235 lbs (tested). Not quite 1000 pound club but I'm happy.  Goal from here on out is to keep my strength gains up, maybe gain a few more lbs. Take off for 2 weeks at the end of December, then start my cut. Hoping to get down to 190 before June. Love being bigger although I haven't enjoyed ripping all my clothes and moving up 3 pants sizes and 1-2 shirt sizes. I made some pretty good facial gains too. Everyone notices how much bigger I've gotten and it's all been positive.  Thanks to this community for the inspiration. I started because a bad breakup. If you're reading this and were in my shoes a year ago.. start now, it's the best thing you can do for yourself."

Brogress,2lfky0,narkazokh,2,Thu Nov 6 14:14:26 2014 UTC,"Hey man, congrats! you've made some great progress. I had a question.. in your 6 month progress post (last one), you said you were eating 3.5-4k cals/day. Have you still been eating this amount these past 6 months? Also, can I ask what you do for a living? I'm also 25/5'10, but work a very sedentary job. If i were to eat 3.5-4k cals/day, I'd get fat as shit. Thanks for the inspiration, brobro."
Brogress,2lfky0,narkazokh,2,Thu Nov 6 18:29:21 2014 UTC,"I've still been eating around 3.5k cals per day maybe more to be honest. I honestly do not count at all.   Typical day is breakfast - 4 xl eggs, 1 whole wheat PB sandwich, 16 oz milk,   lunch - either 3 entree meal from Panda (Grilled Chicken / beef and broc, brown rice, steamed veggies) or chipotle (double black beans/ brown rice, meat, cheese, veggies) with 16 oz milk.   A snack before the gym at 5 (protein bar and milk or nuts). Dinner is usually whole wheat pasta with sausage or beef, or burgers on wheat/ chicken and broc, protein shake with creatine before bed.  I actually have a pretty sedentary job as well. I'm at my desk 8-5 most days. Once or twice a week I drive around for half a day (sales job) so I'm not too active. You probably won't get fat if you eat 3.5k cals clean (veggies, meats, wheat products, dairy). How much do you weigh now?"

Try to do more benching and more deadlifting if you want improvements in strength, though I'm sure you know that already. You wouldn't need to add much more to see some sweet strength gains.

Brogress,2lep2h,Gnill,6,Wed Nov 5 23:57:28 2014 UTC,"Diet: I'm a student and a lazy one at that so I had no diet in particular. I just made sure I ate enough protein, carbs and fat a day. I got to where I am with a pretty hackjob diet but consistent gym efforts.  The main things were:   Chicken breast or streak for dinner almost always. Ate quite a lot of eggs/omlettes 3 scoop protein shakes daily with creatine Ate a tonne of cereal honestly   Routine: I tried my best to go to the gym all seven days of the week, the gym is a 10 minute walk from where I flat so it's easy to go. I did a brosplit for the most of the year which went something like:    Chest + Calves - Always did flyes no matter what chest workout. Calf raises were pretty much the only thing I could do at my gym so I did a lot of sets. Shoulders - I pretty much always included lateral raises. My rear delts I had to focus on since a few months ago with facepulls which has helped. Back - I go to a university gym full on powerlifters so deadlift is much of an option. I instead did rack pulls and hyperextensions for lower back. Always did wide lat pulldowns and I absolutely love all rowing exercises. Biceps - Mainly just used the preacher curl machine and basic barbell curls. If you have an EZ bar accessible to you then I'd recommend that over barbell. Triceps - Lots of cable exercises. Straight/V-bar and Rope pulldowns. Did dips to get a bit of chest action as well. Legs - Regular squats for many sets, front squats for many sets (both like 5/6 sets), leg press, and leg extensions until fail. I have iliotibial band syndrome on my left leg so I couldn't really do hamstrings as hard as I wanted. For those I did stiff-legged deadlift, lying leg curls. Abs - I really like hanging leg raises, knee raises and ab wheel stuff. I also sometimes like doing broomsticks and cable crunches (I don't know what you call them). I did most things for 10-8 rep range except abs and calves which would sometimes hit 20-30 reps."

First pic is one of the only ones I could grab off of facebook of me before I started lifting, probably around 2008.  Next two are 2010-2011, I made sure to hit the gym as often as possible, but wasn't really serious with my supplementation or routine.  Third pic is last year, getting pretty serious about lifting, and discovered sweet lighting in my building's gym.  Final pic is my current physique.  I'd say I'm pretty focused and serious with my routine and constantly improving my body.  Diet still needs attention; due to my work schedule and work itself I rarely eat anywhere near the amount of calories I need to.

If and when I get to the point you're at now (approximately the same height) I would like to think I would just maintain. Good on you for constantly improving though."
Brogress,2l8glg,Mampfificationful,7,Tue Nov 4 05:42:56 2014 UTC,"yeah I'll be the first to admit I didn't pay as much attention to my legs as I should have for the longest time.  I didn't necessarily skip legs, I would just devote as much time in the gym for legs as I did for chest, for example. I've recently started to give myself a lot more time in the gym when I train legs, and slowly seeing results is assuring.  thanks for checking out my post."
Brogress,2l8glg,french16,-8,Tue Nov 4 05:54:47 2014 UTC,"I think you might just have poor squat form, it seems very odd you can squat the same amount as your max bench..."
Brogress,2l8glg,CowboyBigBoss,8,Tue Nov 4 10:17:13 2014 UTC,"I think its actually the contrary, if I widen my stance to almost sumo width and squat down to just above parallel, I easily add 50lbs to my squat.  However, Ive become more and more of a form nazi lately, checking my ego at the door, and when I squat my legs rarely go wider than 10'' apart, my knees are always facing forward parallel to each other, and not angled out, and I squat as deep as I can.  Maybe from a powerlifting or bodybuilding perspective that's shitty form, but I'm only 25 and more concerned with not destroying my back just to say I squat a little heavier."
Brogress,2l8glg,snapchatmeyoursmile,3,Tue Nov 4 17:14:18 2014 UTC,I don't think it matters how wide your stance is.

Did you do anything in particular, or did it just fix itself?"
Brogress,2l8glg,BooAndMinsc,2,Wed Nov 26 15:09:46 2014 UTC,"well it helped when I got my chest tattoo, because if i was slouching or not standing upright, it would look like an uneven line across my chest as opposed to the slight dip from shoulder to shoulder as it was supposed to.  the vain truth though is that when I started getting visible muscles, they wouldn't show (traps specifically) if i was slouching or my back wasn't straight. and after all what good are gains if you cant show them off/throw them in everyones face"

Bis/Tris and finish with light forearm exercises mostly to help with circulation related pain in my arms    Back.  I try to alternate between heavy row exercises and light ones.   Leg Day.  1 Quad then 1 Calf the 1 Hamstring exercise and rotate until I'm done.  (still working on this one) finish with some abs.   Shoulders.

I used a slingshot for a month and I noticed my bench going up a bit, but then I got my 1/2 sleeve tattoo and didn't want to use it until it healed completely.  I've been meaning to throw it back on and see how I fare, I just haven't bothered."
Brogress,2l8glg,Dinney,1 point,Tue Nov 4 06:51:37 2014 UTC,can you fill me in on what rep ranges you used to get up to that point?
Brogress,2l8glg,nandoschickenwings1,5,Tue Nov 4 07:11:51 2014 UTC,"sorry if it's not too specific, im not one for really tracking reps/sets.    in the beginning most days I would do 135x12  185x8-10 225x4-6.  depending if i felt good or had a friend to spot, i'd try 255 1 or two times.    as I got stronger I would do 135x10 185x10 225x6-8 (until failure pretty much).  then I would do one more one-rep set at 275.    if i got 275, I would throw on a 5lb plate and do that for 1 rep, and go up until I couldn't bench the weight once on my own.   Nowadays I don't like to wear myself out on lower weight, so I'll bench 135x5 165x5 185x5 205x5 225x5 (all pause reps) then 275x~3 normal rep, 305x1, then 315x1 if i'm having a good day, I can't hit it consistently quite yet.  the next week i'll throw a 5lb plate on before I load up the first 45lb plate and repeat the same rep range (145x5, 175x5, 195x5 etc etc).  each week I try to add at the very least a 2.5lb plate to the bar (a bastardized 5x5, if you will)"

Ensure you're well nourished so you get the most out of your workouts, which means hitting all your macros, not just your protein.  You can eat all the protein you want, but if you don't have the carbs and fats to give you the energy, your body is just going to catabolize whatever is available to it instead of building muscle.  Also, wrong sub.  /r/fitness is where you wanted.  And whether or not you're interested in the gear, /r/steroids for an extremely helpful community regarding increasing in size/strength.  When you get really geeky about your lifting, /r/weightroom.  Hope that helps."
Brogress,2l4sel,thealec,2,Mon Nov 3 22:12:25 2014 UTC,"Cable flys, tri-kickbacks, and 21's are by far the easiest way to add size to both arms and chest.  How much do you eat and train?"

Brogress,2l4sel,Otterwut,1 point,Mon Nov 3 21:47:44 2014 UTC,I read something that basically said if you werent cycling 21's were a waste of time compared to other rep schemes. Anyone have any info on this?
Brogress,2l4sel,thealec,2,Tue Nov 4 00:46:22 2014 UTC,I haven't heard of that. I have heard that 21's are a great way to get your foot in the door and can then be added to other complex rotation exercises.
Brogress,2l4sel,d5000,1 point,Tue Nov 4 01:46:07 2014 UTC,"I have an 86"" wingspan, and let me tell you - it's going to take time.  Our biceps and triceps (and shoulders, to some extent) are SO long.  Genetic differences aside from our smaller swolebros, we're going to put on muscle at the same rate it's just that the mass is stretched rather than being more compact for those with small arms.  Any major lifts that incorporate hypertrophy rep ranges wiht linear progression will do it.  I've been running PHAT for almost 6 months and have seen gainz, but it's taken time."
Brogress,2l4sel,Sciar,1 point,Mon Nov 3 22:01:02 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure how long you've been working out but I'm 6'2"" and had a similar issue but based on your picture I've got a lot more definition in those areas than you and I actually weigh about 10-15lbs less than you.  Time was my key, I lift heavy and I keep trying to push it. There's no exercise like bench for gaining in the chest. It took mine a very long time but as my bench has risen so has my chests development. I had to add on a bit of bodyweight to keep it rising but it's built up now.  I have a similar giant wingspan too, my arms don't always look huge, if I flex there's a ton of definition and if I don't they can look kinda meh. I only have my OHP up to about 130lbs but my shoulders pop out quite a bit. That's what really gives your arm a muscular look when it's not even flexed.   In my opinion there's only two real answers to your question. Heavy compound lifts and weight. Keep on gaining, I think in the end I want to be around 205lbs with a low bodyfat which is quite a bit of work. Shorter guys can pull off a body I'd be perfectly content as my final look around 170lbs but for us we need way more weight to actually look fit at all times."

I found out that proper nutrition and consistency and routine is EVERYTHING. Shocked to see I made progress within the first couple of weeks!

For breakfast I always chose the oats option as opposed to egg whites and the time taken cooking them up in meal prep.  I kept it simple for lunch and dinner I almost exclusively had (Chicken breast/Lean red meat) with steamed veggies and brown/white rice. However in week 9-12 there is no carbs after breakfast. They advise you to use their products but it's not needed. I used my usual protein, bulk cassein, and own pre workout.  I had cheat meals yes once or twice a week. Unashamedly love my suger and fat.

Also Greek yogurt and two protein shake during the day (which includes one shake work skim milk after workouts)

Brogress,2ku6uv,pilotoatomico,2,Thu Nov 6 23:09:42 2014 UTC,Nicely done! Can you tell me anything about your routine or dietary plan?
Brogress,2ku6uv,pilotoatomico,1 point,Fri Oct 31 00:51:30 2014 UTC,"Thanks! My routine is a 4 day split.   Monday - legs/abs  Tuesday - chest/bi/tri  Thursday - Shoulders/back  Friday - Chest/bi/tri  I hit traps a couple times during the week  I also have a weights class. It's not very strict so I just focus on my own exercises.  My diet during my weight loss was just me eating healthier, cutting out drinks with calories/fast food/etc. I do not count calories or macros. For my bulk all I do now is just eat more, but still eating healthy."

Did you do any cardio? Is it possible you could tell me how it all started for you? It would be greatly appreciated.
Brogress,2ku6uv,jefffffffff,1 point,Fri Nov 21 07:42:33 2014 UTC,Yeah I did about 20 minutes of cardio each gym session. And what do you exactly mean by how it all started? Do you mean how I got fat? Or how I started working out
Brogress,2ku6uv,uberBored,2,Fri Nov 21 15:06:31 2014 UTC,How you started working out. I just see a lot of skinny dudes trying to get big and not enough fat dudes trying to get fit.
Brogress,2ku6uv,tburns1469,1 point,Fri Nov 21 16:24:25 2014 UTC,"I started last summer, mainly focusing on lifting weights and then doing around 20 minutes of cardio per gym session. My diet wasnt perfect so it took me a little while longer than i anticipated to lose all the weight.  Looking at it now i wish i just focused on losing all the weight and then gaining muscle. It would have been so much easier"

Brogress,2konxo,spacetug,3,Thu Oct 30 15:07:01 2014 UTC,"Congrats on the progress!  Are your most recent pictures flexed or relaxed? If flexed, you're probably around 12-14% bodyfat. If relaxed, probably around 10%.  Estimating bodyfat by photos is generally not very accurate, due to variations from person to person. If you want a real number, get a DEXA scan."

Brogress,2ki675,MattyStack,6,Mon Oct 27 21:40:00 2014 UTC,I am very interested in seeing a video of you benching 200lbs and deadlifting 315. I have a hard time believing that when you weigh 130lbs but it's certainly possible if you were on some strength training programs.  http://www.exrx.net/Testing/WeightLifting/BenchStandards.html - at your weight you're near advanced level lifts... which is crazy.
Brogress,2ki675,Unique-Name,4,Tue Oct 28 19:03:30 2014 UTC,"I have good genetics. My dad used to be a powerlifter. I had a (around 130lbs)bodyweight bench when I started.  This is the best I can provide you with.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/ojdlbx7buh8fkhn/IMG_1269.MOV?dl=0 (This was a video of me doing 185x4 bench)  This video is embarrassing though(Please ignore the grunting). I do realize my form got shitty, but the weight was very heavy for me.  I was able to do my current numbers in about half a year. I'm excited to see that I can do once I start bulking."
Brogress,2ki675,Unique-Name,2,Tue Oct 28 20:00:06 2014 UTC,"If those are 2x 5lbs, that's approx 195lbs? So I'll take it considering you repped it more than once.  Very impressive, don't mind the grunting. I'm about 162lbs I train purely for bodybuilding. I don't ever try for strength, but you can certainly tell that strength/mass are usually linear but you can train a lot of strength regardless of mass and you my friend prove that.  I can probably max rep 195 maybe 200 for one. but usually 185x3.  Nice lifts dude!"
Brogress,2ki675,Darth2132,3,Tue Oct 28 20:06:25 2014 UTC,"Thanks. That is actually 185 lbs in total. The plates in my basement have weird weights. The small plate is 2.5 lbs, and the plate in the middle is like 22.5."
Brogress,2ki675,Darth2132,4,Tue Oct 28 20:24:57 2014 UTC,"You're lookin' ripped, but since you weigh 130lbs I would think bulking is a better idea than cutting. However, it's you're body, do whatever the fuck you wanna do."
Brogress,2ki675,zoingk,6,Mon Oct 27 22:30:50 2014 UTC,"Thanks. I do this for wrestling, so I'm not trying to bulk until after the season when I don't have to make weight anymore."

Brogress,2k8fhc,HighRisk26,3,Sat Oct 25 17:57:07 2014 UTC,"Thanks dude! Well when I started lifting I had a very low bf % and I was able to maintain a similar percentage throughout my lifting career. I do no cardio and have yet to run through a full bulk and cut cycle. I picked up a 12lb bag of optimum nutrition mass gainer (called serious mass) and taking 2 scoops everyday for about 2 weeks allowed me to put on over 7 pounds of mostly muscle but still some fat. I've been off the gainer for a few weeks now so I have probably lost a little fat since then but I still have maintained a pretty decent bf%. Currently I am ""bulking"" although I'm not eating as much as I should be but I do not do any cardio and try and eat as much as possible. I have not used any type or steroid or anything like that. I take a pre workout before I workout which has a small amount of creatine in it and usually drink a 25g whey protein shake after I workout. Other than that and the gainer I have not taken anything else to help with my lifting/physique. I'm trying to put on some more mass and cut in the spring to lower my bf%. But yea that's pretty much it. I haven't missed a day at the gym (5 days a week no exceptions) and have been very consistent with my eating habits. Thanks again man, means a lot."

So i knew right off the bat what to do and what works. But my for my workout schedule I do chest and tris on the same day (a lot of benching, weighted dips, close grip bench press, pec fly machine, chest press, tricep pull down.) I do back and bis on the same day (Weighted wide and close grip pullups, bent over row, lat pull down, seated row, bicep curls, hammer, preacher.) For shoulders I do mostly military press, over head dumbbell press, and lateral raise. And finally for legs I do pretty much only squats. My lower body is not as strong as my upper body so im a little behind with my legs. But i generally do 3 sets or more of each at 1-3 reps, 4-6 reps, 4-8 reps. I' ve continued this routine since I started and its worked for me so far. Thanks again"

Brogress,2k8fhc,neon627,1 point,Sun Oct 26 12:15:43 2014 UTC,"Thanks man! And I usually start off each lift at a heavy weight and get about 1-3 reps. Not for every exercise and I don't max out everyday so some days I start off with like 4-6 reps. But after my first set i usually do the same weight for the same reps (if I can haha) and then for the third set I drop the weight a bit and do at least 5-6 reps. I don't do too much low weight high rep so I hardly ever do sets with over 10-12 reps.  So for instance on bench I do a heavy set for 1-3 reps, do it again, then drop the weight by 10-20 pounds and get 3-6 reps in, then drop the weight a bit more and get 6-8 reps in. Lately I've been trying to get more low weight high rep to switch it up but I still mainly focus on heavier weight and lower rep."

Lots of chipotle, chicken, brown rice, spinach, broccoli, asparagus, steak, oatmeal + blueberries, and yogurt. I also try and have milk with every meal if it's available."
Brogress,2k7qs4,TotesBlazed,2,Fri Oct 24 23:07:11 2014 UTC,How did you come up with your routine? Did you just look for a mix of lifts off of websites that focused on the muscle groups with enough sets and reps until you were tired out?
Brogress,2k7qs4,hohnsenhoff,2,Fri Oct 24 22:43:01 2014 UTC,"When I started I just aimlessly lifted things until I got comfortable in the gym. Then a buddy of mine suggested I pulled my head out of my ass and pick a muscle group to lift every day. I ended up crafting this split based on how long it usually takes to recover. The only real issue I have with it is there isn't enough gap between triceps and chest for how long it takes me to recover. I'm thinking about switching to a chest/tris, back/bis split to deal with my longer recovery."
Brogress,2k7qs4,hohnsenhoff,2,Fri Oct 24 23:09:22 2014 UTC,Sounds good. R/fitness has this never ending circle jerk about SS but I feel like you do what's good for you
Brogress,2k7qs4,hohnsenhoff,2,Fri Oct 24 23:45:44 2014 UTC,"wtf dude, you bulked up and your body fat went down? (I ask because hip bones )"
Brogress,2k7qs4,urgencyy,0,Fri Oct 24 23:37:04 2014 UTC,"Newbie gains. Also those are obliques bro, not hip bones.."
Brogress,2k7qs4,sipoloco,2,Sat Oct 25 02:41:11 2014 UTC,"That looks surprisingly like myself in the first picture, good to have a reference point that I can go off of"
Brogress,2k7qs4,thatbadrogue,2,Fri Oct 24 23:58:23 2014 UTC,"Hey, good luck, brother. If I could offer any advice it would be to not worry about body fat and eat big from the start. I spent a few months eating at matintiance and went nowhere."
Brogress,2k7qs4,superpersian,2,Sat Oct 25 00:06:34 2014 UTC,"Okay, yeah my issue is with my ADHD meds they are amphetamine-based so my appetite is zero. Going to have to go to shakes"
Brogress,2k7qs4,superpersian,4,Sat Oct 25 00:36:48 2014 UTC,"I might recommend marijuana, either medically or otherwise, at night to help you fit in another meal; it helps a lot of my friends who have similar meds control their appetite."
Brogress,2k7qs4,thatbadrogue,2,Sat Oct 25 23:35:56 2014 UTC,"Yeah not going to do that, my job is in security and they drug test a LOT. Thanks for the idea"

Brogress,2k6bjk,hueyIewis,19,Fri Oct 24 16:51:45 2014 UTC,"this guy is 6 percent after his dexa scan,so you might not be, but good progress nonetheless. It would be helpful if you included some info like lift numbers, routines or diet too."
Brogress,2k6bjk,tjenator,7,Fri Oct 24 13:29:15 2014 UTC,This guy is not 6%.
Brogress,2k6bjk,cyan2k,4,Fri Oct 24 18:19:39 2014 UTC,It seems you missed the part with the dexa scan confirming his 6% BF. OP is at 8-9% BF max.
Brogress,2k6bjk,tjenator,5,Wed Oct 29 12:50:30 2014 UTC,By this guy I meant OP.
Brogress,2k6bjk,cyan2k,3,Wed Oct 29 12:54:41 2014 UTC,Ah I see. Sry for this misunderstanding.
Brogress,2k6bjk,tjenator,2,Wed Oct 29 13:10:25 2014 UTC,Nah man don't worry about it.
Brogress,2k6bjk,super101,8,Wed Oct 29 15:14:19 2014 UTC,lifts?
Brogress,2k6bjk,SwordfshII,3,Fri Oct 24 12:57:27 2014 UTC,Bench - 235lb max Squat - about 260lbs max Deadlift - 335 max
Brogress,2k6bjk,ilovemagicmush,12,Fri Oct 24 19:08:59 2014 UTC,"That isn't 6 percent, that is more like 8-9 percent. 6 is way drier and veinier"
Brogress,2k6bjk,Janneman-a,5,Fri Oct 24 14:37:19 2014 UTC,You look great dude! Not 6% though. Probably 9-10 ish.

Brogress,2k6bjk,Vontom,1 point,Fri Oct 24 14:36:55 2014 UTC,"Sorry it's taken so long to get back to you. I kept meaning to measure my arms lol. They're 15.5"" cold 16"" pumped. I'm shooting for 17-17.5's. Good luck with you cut btw lol. They're painful."
Brogress,2k6bjk,fuweike,1 point,Sun Oct 26 08:56:19 2014 UTC,Can you say what exercise routine had the biggest impact on your development?
Brogress,2k6bjk,Vontom,1 point,Fri Oct 24 14:42:42 2014 UTC,All of them. Lol I'm gonna be posting my routine to another comment in a second
Brogress,2k6bjk,DiepFries,1 point,Fri Oct 24 19:09:43 2014 UTC,Can you post your diet and routine?
Brogress,2k32uy,GoldBond007,10,Thu Oct 23 10:55:35 2014 UTC,I read it first and thought it was six months progress not 1 year and 6 months. Did you take large breaks inbetween? You need to eat a hell of a lot more and track your diet. I like to use a notepad and write what i eat then calculate the calories and other nutritional information. It really really helps with gainz. Also i'd take the advice of /u/tcmeng because you really shouldnt be deadlifting what you bench lol maybe for a warmup yeah but not as a main workout. Still though you look way better than before so congrats.
Brogress,2k32uy,psychollama1,1 point,Thu Oct 23 14:35:22 2014 UTC,it has more to do with I had no idea what I was doing and it took me longer than I would have really liked to learn how to do the lifts properly and not feel like an idiot. That feeling made me bail more times than I'd like to admit. It wasn't until 7 months in that I gained enough confidence to actually talk to people and ask questions. That's when I finally left the machines and really started using the free weights.
Brogress,2k32uy,psychollama1,1 point,Thu Oct 23 20:34:30 2014 UTC,ahh yeah i know that feeling. for the first few months of my lifting journey i only used machines and did a shit ton of cardio haha not exactly the best way to make gainz. you should follow a good program like icf or ss for a few months and then post again. Im sure youll make some great gains
Brogress,2k32uy,maninorbit,1 point,Thu Oct 23 20:55:05 2014 UTC,"Haha thanks man. That's pretty much what I was doing too. I'm really starting to take this seriously now. I think I just have to work on my diet and ditch the workout I'm on now. It helped, but I'm seeing a lot of good ideas on here"
Brogress,2k32uy,psychollama1,-1,Thu Oct 23 21:15:13 2014 UTC,There are plenty of smartphone apps that can track your calories and macros without having to pull out pen and paper.  What is this the 1980's?
Brogress,2k32uy,TheTrickIsNothing,3,Thu Oct 23 15:22:16 2014 UTC,"i like writing it down, if he wants to use an app he can do whatever he wants"
Brogress,2k32uy,fuweike,7,Thu Oct 23 17:03:04 2014 UTC,You can deadlift more! I believe in you.
Brogress,2k32uy,tcmeng,2,Thu Oct 23 11:52:11 2014 UTC,That's what I chant to myself whenever I try!
Brogress,2k32uy,-ogre-,2,Thu Oct 23 12:06:03 2014 UTC,"Try harder.  You can do it.  Also, I'd like to add: you can squat way more than that.  I would focus on major compound lifts.  Look up Starting Strength or a similar program that focuses on barbell lifts.  Add five pounds each time you work out until you fail the lift.  You really have to give it all you've got.  If you complete the exercise and don't feel like a whipped rag, you know you should have tried harder and/or lifted more weight.  You will see the results of your hard work.  You've made good progress so far, but have a ways to go before anything great."
Brogress,2k32uy,Aquipy,9,Thu Oct 23 16:56:34 2014 UTC,You should do a beginner routine like Ice Cream Fitness - http://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/jason-blaha-ice-cream-fitness-5x5-novice-workout  It is a terrific routine and will even out your numbers a little more. You should not be benching what you deadlift. Those numbers should go: Overhead press < Bench < Squat < Deadlift.  Don't worry about weight too much and focus on a few months of heavy lifting and good form. Cheers
Brogress,2k32uy,i_poop_splinters,34,Thu Oct 23 13:36:54 2014 UTC,I'm going to keep it real with you and I expect a lot of down votes. You look like absolute shit if it's true that you have been training for a year and six months.
Brogress,2k32uy,Ozarkian,13,Thu Oct 23 12:41:22 2014 UTC,"Damn that's harsh, and OP I feel like you could've gotten way bigger in a year and 6 months. Progress is progress THO, and you definitely look better. Great job"
Brogress,2k32uy,Vistian,-2,Thu Oct 23 13:18:04 2014 UTC,"is it really bad though? He's obviously gained muscle and slimmed down.. He probably didn't do a traditional bulk and cut, but who actually started off counting macros here?   I think his progress is solid"
Brogress,2k32uy,Onimal,6,Thu Oct 23 18:05:33 2014 UTC,"I'm going to keep it real and agree with you. Part of the allure of this sub is so out of shape people can look and say ""this is what 1 year and 6 months worth of dedication might look like if i commit myself"". To have this guy's after result? I wouldn't work a month for that.  Sorry...your realness was contagious"
Brogress,2k32uy,-ogre-,-8,Thu Oct 23 19:34:40 2014 UTC,"Wow 21 lbs of what could be muscle in a month?  You must be an impressive specimen to achieve that. Either that or you struggle to lose 3 lbs in a month while being a hefty 232 lb dude lol come on man, if you are going to judge with nothing insightful to say, judge based on what's possible for yo. Not what you see others around you doing."
Brogress,2k32uy,Rosenmyah,8,Thu Oct 23 21:00:34 2014 UTC,"I hate that this is the top comment rather than legitimate good advice like ""do starting strength and eat a lot more"". This is really a bummer and doesn't help him in anyway."
Brogress,2k32uy,-ogre-,11,Thu Oct 23 16:25:48 2014 UTC,"Ok, what exactly? Like I said, I'm here to learn."
Brogress,2k32uy,Spezticle_Spence,11,Thu Oct 23 12:56:12 2014 UTC,Choose a goal: Cut or Bulk  Find a diet Plan:  Try IIFYM (it works)  Find a lifting program  Do that every single day of your life.
Brogress,2k32uy,Vistian,7,Thu Oct 23 16:30:45 2014 UTC,"Let's forget about the aesthetic for a second, cause you look better than when you first started (shoulders and delts).  But lets focus on your actual lifts. Your bench is the same as your deadlift. And your squat is way stronger than your deadlift. I'm thinking this is due to an unbalanced routine because it's usually deadlift > squat > benchpress. What is your lifting schedule (routine) like?"
Brogress,2k32uy,supercharly,-4,Thu Oct 23 22:53:46 2014 UTC,For awhile I really thought that it would be ideal to have each of the lifts pretty close to the same number so that's what I was trying for.
Brogress,2k32uy,spirit_spine,-6,Thu Oct 23 23:35:32 2014 UTC,"What are you trying to do, get big and bully or be lean and cut."
Brogress,2k32uy,supercharly,1 point,Thu Oct 23 13:00:25 2014 UTC,"Well at first all I wanted to do was just get out of the 150 zone. Now that I did that, I want to start working on being lean and defined before I try my hand at bulking."
Brogress,2k32uy,spirit_spine,2,Thu Oct 23 13:06:46 2014 UTC,If I were you id bulk for ages
Brogress,2k32uy,MaliciousMirth,-1,Fri Oct 24 02:28:48 2014 UTC,I would advise a 12 week bulk of clean calories and compound lifts honestly. It's almost like a nice sculpture you have to have a big block of ice before you can chisel it out for the sculpture.
Brogress,2k32uy,supercharly,-1,Thu Oct 23 13:11:35 2014 UTC,"plz tell us oh great one what a clean calorie is? Do you mean a ""clean bulk?""   if you're gonna bulk it has to be longer than 12 weeks. A ""clean bulk"" is .5 lbs a week so 12 weeks theoretically can only fetch 6 lbs gained, and no tall of that will be muscle.  I would double that... 24 weeks. Bulk for the next half a year. Do a program you enjoy. Just make sure you are always trying to do more reps or more weight. You will be good."
Brogress,2k32uy,MaliciousMirth,4,Thu Oct 23 18:07:42 2014 UTC,I came to say this.
Brogress,2k32uy,mephyt,-1,Thu Oct 23 20:33:04 2014 UTC,He's right.
Brogress,2k32uy,EpReese,17,Thu Oct 23 16:23:44 2014 UTC,"That's OK progress actually, here are some before/after comparison pictures.  Your bodyfat% remained in the 16% / 17% range, and your lean mass went from 125 lbs to about 143 lbs. That means you put on ~18 lbs of muscle, so almost exactly 1 lb of muscle per month. That's on the lower end of the bulking spectrum but that's all right (regular lifters put on between 1 lb and 3 lbs of muscle per month)  Bonus fact: your shoulders-to-waist ratio went from 1.41 to 1.60. Nice job."
Brogress,2k32uy,chadman42,12,Thu Oct 23 16:53:02 2014 UTC,I bet there are redditors who would pay you small amounts of money to put a size comparison graph like that together for them.
Brogress,2k32uy,chadman42,19,Thu Oct 23 17:01:18 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I've been building an app that does exactly that actually (and other nifty features such as bodyfat-eyeballing). It's not ready yet but I plan to release it in the next few months!"
Brogress,2k32uy,theedoor,3,Thu Oct 23 17:08:03 2014 UTC,"Oh, awesome, keep us all updated on that!"
Brogress,2k32uy,Who_Runs_Barter_Town,2,Thu Oct 23 17:17:47 2014 UTC,Can you send me a reminder or will you post in this sub once its done?  I really liked that graph you did inlaying all the pics.

Brogress,2jzpln,midgetforce2k,-5,Wed Oct 22 19:26:29 2014 UTC,Easy answer? Smart guys who want to get big quick.
Brogress,2jzpln,WishfulTraveler,5,Wed Oct 22 19:39:46 2014 UTC,This is not smart.  Gear doesn't grow your ligaments anywhere near as fast as it does your muscles so you set yourself up for a tear.  It's generally not recommended to start gear until you're a relatively advanced lifter.
Brogress,2jzpln,CJS14,1 point,Wed Oct 22 22:54:38 2014 UTC,Yes. The biggest issue you face is ligament health. Just take it easy when you lift for at least a year to let them catch up. It's a really drastic change and the body needs time to recover.
Brogress,2jzpln,WishfulTraveler,1 point,Thu Oct 23 00:43:11 2014 UTC,"Honestly, i seriously doubt it. I think it's far more likely he's lied about the time frame, or the pictures aren't even him. No one pins in the first 5 months of going to the gym."

Brogress,2ju2fm,moddestmouse,3,Tue Oct 21 00:42:32 2014 UTC,"Ive changed up my workouts a lot over time, but most recently ive been running a P/P/L variation twice a week, and if im feeling good on the rest day ill normally go in and hit some week spots (calves, arms, whatever else im feeling small about). This has been working best for me because my body responds well to a lot of volume. And diet-wise i keep my macros around 40\30\30 and im bulking at 3400 calories daily. Which is 500 over my maintenance level"
Brogress,2ju2fm,Kezas,3,Tue Oct 21 17:41:15 2014 UTC,Did you start right from the get go eating 3400? How can someone eat at such a huge surplus for 3 years and be so ripped? Or have you done cuts
Brogress,2ju2fm,B_S_O_D,4,Tue Oct 21 18:07:33 2014 UTC,"No im only eating 3400 on my current bulk, i was on a cut over summer at around 2400 which ended a month ago. I got down to around 7% after my cut and in the picture i was at around 8.8% a month into the bulk."

Brogress,2jp7gf,Nickbronline,2,Sun Oct 19 21:52:00 2014 UTC,"Yeah I'm with OP.as a 6'0 person, above-average height/tall people usually tend to eat way more calories than one who is shorter.

Brogress,2jp7gf,CantChooseUsernames,1 point,Sun Oct 19 21:57:41 2014 UTC,I've been eating a lot of food mostly heathy but I don't gain any weight which is annoying. Should I start counting my calories ?
Brogress,2jp7gf,CantChooseUsernames,1 point,Sun Oct 19 23:16:37 2014 UTC,"yes!  you're not enough calories, trust me. calculate your calorie Expidenture, add 500 calories to that, and wait two weeks. If you weight gain, keep it like that. If you don't, add 100 more. Tailor it until you're gaining weight at a healthy rate (.5 or 1 lbs per week)  I was 160 and now im 167 after ~6-7weeks.   Just remember if you're gaining weight too fast, it's probably fat, so tone it down a bit if you notice that."

Brogress,2jp7gf,EvilMooBear,1 point,Mon Oct 20 11:29:36 2014 UTC,"You can find tons of workout routines online. I use PPL I described it in a little more detail above. My advice would just be to make sure you're eating enough; 6'2 is pretty tall so you're probably pretty skinny like me. Just make sure you're not skipping meals and make sure you're putting your time in at the gym. Use good form and try to focus on mind-muscle connection, use light weights until you have the form down then you can move up in weight."

Brogress,2jp7gf,spitak,-1,Mon Oct 20 01:25:15 2014 UTC,Protein shakes are like necessary if you're even remotely serious about gains
Brogress,2jp7gf,yutrahkill,1 point,Tue Oct 21 05:15:55 2014 UTC,I knew that but there is so many different kinds that I wouldn't know where to start.

Brogress,2jpy9d,Conquerz,4,Mon Oct 20 06:16:33 2014 UTC,"My routine is the culmination of three years of slowly adding things which work and subtracting things which don't. normally it is along the lines of Monday: bicep, forearms, chest Tuesday: back, trap, bi, chest Wednesday: tri, forearms,bi, chest Thursday: Legs Friday: chest, forearms, trap, bi, Saturday: Off Sunday: delts, traps, bi, chest. I realize it is outlandish, but bodybuilding is one of the most individualistic hobbies out there and this is tried and true to work for me. As far as diet goes, I'm unfortunately a low income college-student.... so my diet is shitty I eat fast food and ramen a lot, I also can only afford whatever the cheapest protein is at whatever grocery store I'm at and I can't afford supplements . I eat about 4000-4500 on days I lift. I also take my multi and 4 fish oil tabs (2 in the mornings and 2 before bed)"

On October 27th I'll be celebrating going to the gym every single week for the last 12 months. There was a week in January where I worked out 2 times a week. And a couple in July where I worked out only 2-3 times a week. But it's been consistent 5-6 days a week in all the other months.  Remaining uninteresting to strangers has resulted in not having a girlfriend or a social life which has helped tremendously in being able to accomplish such a feat.   DIET (example:)  Breakfast: 2 scoops of Whey with 250 mL of 2% milk (sometimes with 100 g of oatmeal or another cereal.)  Lunch: 2 Ham and Cheese sandwiches, granola bar, and a Protein Shake (2 scoops of Mutant Mass, Water, and 5 g of Creatine Powder)  Snack: Protein Shake (2 Scoops of Mutant Mass and water) Maybe some peanuts/trail mix/granola bar (40 g.)  Dinner: 2 Chicken breasts, white rice, veggies, cup of water  Late night Snack: Cold Oatmeal in milk and 2 scoops of whey  Throughout the day, I drink a lot of Water. Lots and lots of water. I have a metal water bottle on me at all times during work and workouts. I drink a shit ton of water.  This diet has been my usual for the last 2 months. In the months before that (January to August) My lunch consisted of either McDonalds (2 McDoubles and small fries) or Subway (6 inch sub of the day with sweet onion sauce), because of convenience during work."
Brogress,2jmkvu,urgencyy,5,Sun Oct 19 02:01:43 2014 UTC,240 BP? the chest doesn't seem like one that could lift 240 but if you say so  edit: with that routine and diet I think you should be seeing more of a difference
Brogress,2jmkvu,NigBeCray,1 point,Sun Oct 19 05:37:13 2014 UTC,"Ok, admittedly, I do incremental sets and it's on a smith machine, so it should be 220 due to lower barbell weight. My sets are 180, 190, 200, 210, 220. 100 lbs on both sides + the barbell.   The routine has been like that for only the last 4 months. Before that, I only did dumbell bench presses. My sessions were also 45 min- 1 hr, so overall I worked out less. My diet was also worse, as mentioned above, until 2 months ago.   I'm happy with my gains. Maybe the pic is too blurry, or not a good angle... But I noticed a tremendous physique change over the last 6 months.   As for chest development, I do notice some underdevelopment. Perhaps my form needs to be worked on."
Brogress,2jmkvu,Thmaxify,2,Sun Oct 19 13:14:15 2014 UTC,Perhaps my form needs to be worked on.   If you're not injured stop using the Smith machine.  You're not building any of your stabilizer muscles so the strength you gain doesn't have much carry over to real life situations or to an actual bench press.

Not a ""cut""... the order matters because it is astronomically easier to lose fat when you have lots of muscle. Muscle requires more  calories just to maintain. So if you pack on 20 lbs of muscle and 15lbs of fat, you could look great. And with that extra muscle it would only take a month to shed that fat.

Ive packed on a ton of muscle and when I shred down to 10% there will be light years of difference between me and you. You keep mentioning aesthetics as your goal and not strength. If you will go educate yourself you will see they are not mutally exclusive. A linear progression up in weight is required to continually overload the muscle and cause growth.

Brogress,2ij0xt,Ibeatmario,7,Tue Oct 7 13:15:36 2014 UTC,Why Would you rate bf against height?
Brogress,2ij0xt,Russz,0,Wed Oct 8 04:41:40 2014 UTC,Should never go over 12% for a bulk period(that's what the big guys say) id say never go past 15%
Brogress,2ij0xt,fuweike,1 point,Tue Oct 7 15:37:44 2014 UTC,Any guess what my BF is currently?
Brogress,2ij0xt,nsummy,1 point,Tue Oct 7 17:47:24 2014 UTC,"ahhh id say maybe around 14-17% im no professional at this tho, just through personal experience."
Brogress,2ij0xt,Raid33,0,Wed Oct 8 11:41:44 2014 UTC,"This is anecdotal evidence, but I've heard it over and over. If you see your brachial artery, you're at 10-12%. If you see your lower abs, you're at 10% and lower."
Brogress,2ij0xt,TheHispanicPanic,3,Wed Oct 8 03:04:30 2014 UTC,"It really depends on your preference, its hard for us to answer. Personally I'd probably bulk about 5 more pounds and cut back to 160-165 but that's just me."
Brogress,2ij0xt,Nutchos,2,Tue Oct 7 05:58:12 2014 UTC,I would start cutting.  I put more emphasis on looking good than attaining maximum mass.  Just my opinion.
Brogress,2ij0xt,Joey208,2,Tue Oct 7 19:19:21 2014 UTC,This is a total personal preference and will depend on your goals. Personally I would cut down but I'm from the camp that believes you can get big muscles while staying lean.  I have no desire to do that ridiculous process of bulking and cutting.
Brogress,2ij0xt,schutyser,1 point,Wed Oct 8 04:27:03 2014 UTC,"I wish I looked like that now... but either way If i was in your shoes i'd slow bulk as the winter is coming/here and then i'd cut when feb/march arrives. I usually start to cut when I get that ""oh shit im really fat"" feeling but you're definately not there."

Brogress,2ii7i5,huzzy,-4,Tue Oct 7 01:04:07 2014 UTC,"^ I would suggest you don't focus on a wide grip, but a close grip instead. It builds the back a lot better. But for detail, include wide grip"
Brogress,2ii7i5,mat1101,0,Tue Oct 7 02:07:56 2014 UTC,"I believe it's the opposite of what you're saying. Wide grip focuses more on the back, while close grip involves a greater use of the arms/biceps."
Brogress,2ii7i5,mat1101,2,Tue Oct 7 02:28:13 2014 UTC,"i usually do a mix of both 2 close/2wides, According to PoG chris jones it reallys depends on how close you hold it for close grip to really hit the back. Usually i hold it just a lil bit more then shoulder width and really try and flex my lats for each pull with a slight angle  I'm certainly doing PHAT. On my upper power day i do pedlay rows with cable rows  On back/arms hyper i do db rolls, wide/close grip, and t bar lol basically anything for my back i really want to build it lol"
Brogress,2ii7i5,mat1101,-5,Tue Oct 7 03:09:11 2014 UTC,"Close grip adds more thickness to the back, while wide adds width, that's what I'm saying, just to clarify"

Brogress,2ike63,Jinbag,-2,Tue Oct 7 15:52:02 2014 UTC,"Ok, Sorry there's no before pictures, but to give context i was a fatty kid until about a year ago when i lost weight, started seriously lifting at the beginning of the year. Tarn 16 a couple weeks ago, I started bulking about a month and a half ago and my current macros are:   2050 calories on rest and 2400 on workout  250C/350C  50F  130P  Tracking on MFP with a food scale and recording my daily weight.  My training is currently a mix of Isolation work, Oly Weightlifting, and the ocassional crossfit, 3-4 Times a week. I currently follow SL 5X5. Any tips on training diet and physique are greatly appreciated."
Brogress,2ike63,windowintheskies,3,Tue Oct 7 15:20:03 2014 UTC,"I think you can afford to eat more. You're still growing and still in puberty, a little more food wouldn't hurt. Keep it up."
Brogress,2ike63,thealec,0,Tue Oct 7 15:50:51 2014 UTC,"I'm trying not to gain too much fat, however, how much more would you suggest would be enough? On workout days i can eat between 2400 to 2550 depending on the workout."
Brogress,2ike63,thealec,3,Tue Oct 7 15:58:13 2014 UTC,"If you're wanting to do a lean bulk then you should be eating more than 3k calories a day of predominantly proteins and complex carbs from fruits and veggies. Always remember though, that fat is required for healthy muscle growth.  At 16 you have a lot of growing left to do so don't get bogged down when you aren't seeing huge gains. Focus on developing good forms and habits early on so you'll be shredded come your 21st birthday."
Brogress,2ike63,GynosTheNewLipo,1 point,Tue Oct 7 16:25:24 2014 UTC,"3k seems like a LOT considering i'm 5'5, but i'll surely eat more. I doubt i'll grow much more since i have the manlet genes in me haha, but thank you."

On bench I do either a 5x5 or an 8,5,3,1. I personally find the 8,5,3,1 to be most helpful with everything because you can do it on bench, squat, and deadlift. For those of you that don't know it's basically 4 sets where you do 8 reps with less weight, next set 5 reps with more weight, and so on. The 1 set should be 95% of your one rep max (respectively)"

Brogress,2ido2t,SandNegro1,6,Sun Oct 5 20:50:59 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I can buy into everything else but the age with all of that muscle mass and even more unlikely, strength, just doesn't add up. It's incredibly hard to put on that kind of strength in one year, especially at the age of 14. But great progress regardless."
Brogress,2ido2t,Sved_the_Tank,-2,Mon Oct 6 15:18:13 2014 UTC,Why does my age make it harder for me to put on that amount of muscle mass in a year?
Brogress,2ido2t,Sved_the_Tank,7,Tue Oct 7 01:44:35 2014 UTC,"Because muscle mass is going to be easier to put on when you hit your peak, and have the most testosterone, around 26-28 years old. But the main thing is that strength (looking at your lifting numbers), is something that takes a lot of time and comes with age, not just muscle mass. And only lifting for a year does not allow you to deadlift and squat over 450lbs. Something about these stats/ age/ time lifting just doesn't add up"

You would be in some crazy high percentile if this was true, but its possible, just suspicious.   You have a great body for physique, wide lats and wide shoulders are the two things they want.

Brogress,2ido2t,BombMarley,8,Sun Oct 12 13:23:01 2014 UTC,make sure your eating enough I barely gained any weight for about 2 months because for some reason I didn't realize I had to eat a lot to gain muscle. Once I started eating I just gained muscle like crazy. Don't program hop find one that you like and stick with it until you can't get any more out of it. My strength started going up a lot when I wasn't completely changing my program every month (muscle confusion isn't real). Make sure your getting enough sleep I try for at least 7.5 hours a night.  Never skip a workout I've never skipped one since I started.  Try to Keep your flexibility good. That's something I've been working on a lot lately because I had trouble a couple months ago getting into a full squat. Don't let getting abs be your number 1 focus unless you already have muscle. Your focus should be muscle first and think about cutting for better looking abs later   If you have any other questions you can pm me. I'm kinda the guy that most people at my school come to if they want advice on lifting so I'm used to helping people out with this stuff.
Brogress,2ido2t,BombMarley,1 point,Sun Oct 12 16:02:29 2014 UTC,"Thanks bro! Definitely eating enough, but made mediocre progress becuase of program hopping during the summer. Gonna stick to starting strength for a couple months now."

I also try to hit hear delts  after every pushing workout. I try to eat over 4000 calories a day and as much protein as I can get (don't really track macros or anything).

My lifts right now are not that recent (haven't maxed out in a while am planning for a big pr day in a couple weeks) . .  .  bench=285lbs (planning to hit 305 in a few weeks)  Squat with wraps= 475 (planning to hit 500)  Deadlift= 455 (got 475 to my knees and couldn't lock it out)  Clean= 225x2  Snatch=135x2 (done it maybe twice in my life)  Pull-ups= 16  Ohp= 190  I can post other pictures if anyone is interested  I also have videos of my bench, squat, deadlift, and clean."

Brogress,2hlojk,famasfilms,2,Sun Sep 28 02:17:26 2014 UTC,"I actually went from a strength straining program I used to do in HS weight training into An intermediate bodybuilding push/pull split before going onto PHAT. I was about 1 year into my training before I got on PHAT. I would actually recommend that path since it helps you progress in strength and form some more while still seeing aesthetic gains before attempting the PHAT beast.

Just made sure I was on a caloric surplus and got enough grams of protein. But I'm planning taking my diet more serious, I just have to do some research first! When it comes to supplements, I use whey protein, vitamins (gingseng & fish oil) and I just started taking creatine.   Routine: 5 days of training/week.   Back/biceps:  - Heavy sets of curls then drop sets - Wide grip chin-ups sets to failure.  - Reverse grip pull downs.  - Heavy sets if hammer curls then drop sets.  - Barbell row.  - Concenreation curls (regular & hammer).  - Reverse flyes.  - Preacher curls.  - Wide & close grip pull downs.   Chest/triceps: - Machine flyes.  - One armed push downs to failure.  - Dips until failure.  - Rope push downs.  - Heavy sets of incline dumbbell press then drop sets.  - Cable overhead extension. - Close grip flat bench.  - Flat bench.  - Cable flyes (both lower and upper)  - Skull Crushers.  Shoulders/legs: - Dumbbell lateral raise until failure.  - Leg extension.  - Heavy sets of dumbbell shoulder press (or Arnold press) until failure then drop sets.  - Heavy sets of leg press then drop sets.  - Barbell front raise.  - Kettlebell shrug.  - Squats & lunges.  - Barbell press.  - Leg curls.  - Barbell rear delt raise.  - Barbell calf raise.  - Face pulls.

Brogress,2hkicd,thesorrow312,4,Fri Sep 26 23:59:04 2014 UTC,"Is this the order you do things?  What are your numbers on the major compounds after all this time? No deadlift?   You would be far better off doing a ready made program. If this is the order you do your movements in, then its terribly wrong. You are doing isolation before compound. By the time you get to those flat bench and squats you are going to be pretty exhausted. Those should be the meat and potatoes of your lifting, not just one of the many things you do.  Have you looked at programs like ice cream fitness?"
Brogress,2hkicd,AuzeTheOrdinary,1 point,Sat Sep 27 02:52:21 2014 UTC,"No, it's not the specific order. Bench is usually the first exercise I do on chest day, both incline and flat! And when training legs, I do leg extension first, then move over to squats! It actually feels really good doing extensions before squatting, as long as I don't exhaust myself.   I bench about 210, have never tried anything higher. And squat: 280-290. You guessed right, no deadlifts yet. I would really like to begin doing it  on a regular basis, I just need to learn the proper technique so I don't hurt myself. I've had problems with my collarbone some time but that won't affect deadlifting right? If you have a specific video of website I should look at that would be great!  I've just browsed through a couple of training programs, but never seen anything that caught my attention. All though I would really like to try something new! Is there any other program you recommend except ice cream fitness? Thanks a lot for the advice by the way, much appreciated!"

Brogress,2gxp51,SwagBau5,1 point,Sun Sep 21 19:26:31 2014 UTC,"You certainly can, but you will need to eat at that level of body composition, not what you're used to.  20 lbs of muscle needs quite a bit more food then you're used to when you're 140lbs.  After a few days/weeks off, depending on what you're taking, your appetite will start to spin down to more natural levels, and it will become harder and harder to eat enough - oftentimes eating enough is the hardest part.    If you intend to put on mass, do it when you're lean already; you'll get more quality mass, and can remain lean if you're diligent."

I have been cutting for about 7 weeks and I gave in and have eaten a but more for about 2-3 week and I definitely feel a lot more bloated disappointed in myself. If you could share some tips that would be great! Cheers and keep on lifting!
Brogress,2gxory,JimmyRustlez,1 point,Wed Sep 24 08:48:33 2014 UTC,"I didn't cut by choice, I cut because there wasn't enough food in my house to eat in excess of maintenance. Just make sure that your protein intake is around 1-1.5g/lb you weigh. You might not make progress but you will at least keep some if not all of your strength/muscle. I didn't count any macros during my cut except protein. It sucks to say but I'm not very knowledgable on the subject of cutting and I can only tell you what I did."

The squat and deadlift are kinda low too but it's understandable considering the injury.  Assuming it's a working set, you started at 70 lbs. adding 5 lbs. a week (Which is on the low side for linear gains, most people can add five workout to workout for quite a while.) you have 26 weeks, giving roughly a 200 pound working set assuming no deloads or other issues.  You didn't mention what your starting goal was but if it was performance/strength related maybe lower the volume and focus on intensity and get those numbers up a bit?"

Brogress,2gl6d4,vivalapants,5,Wed Sep 17 01:21:15 2014 UTC,"Duuuude, nice job. Any advice to someone with shitty knees?"
Brogress,2gl6d4,okletstryanother,8,Tue Sep 16 21:24:24 2014 UTC,Learn how to squat. Make sure you get comfortable at the very bottom position of the squat by doing alot of mobility work (hip mobility and ankle mobility). Having good mobility will relieve alot of stress from you joints. If you have a knee injury that causes alot of pain when squatting then stop squatting. It's not worth it getting your knees fucked up further.
Brogress,2gl6d4,schutyser,2,Wed Sep 17 01:18:44 2014 UTC,My knees are injured from playing soccer. I did squats today now I'm in pain again. I need alternative workouts with less to no stress on knees if that's even possible.
Brogress,2gl6d4,Lomelgande,2,Wed Sep 17 04:43:06 2014 UTC,I would just stick to leg press. I know that's frowned on reddit but it will help
Brogress,2gl6d4,nationalism2,2,Wed Sep 17 09:30:29 2014 UTC,"If it's too bad, just don't squat. I know reddit meatheads consider this unacceptable, but better to train legs using leg press/ extension / hamstring curls/ lunges etc. Why risk injury and missing training? I know squatting is optimum for leg training, but it's not the only way. Best of luck"
Brogress,2gl6d4,Lomelgande,1 point,Wed Sep 17 14:25:15 2014 UTC,"Don't go past 90 degrees for one try different squat set ups (front, wide,..) use a bench and do sit down squats use lower weights and more reps (I know it sucks but it will work aswell) do leg press (<90degrees) + leg curls  deadlift is a great leg workout aswell if you can do that (stiff legged will hit hamstrings for example)   I have had 3 knee operations, it suck but try find your own thing that works instead of hurts ;)"
Brogress,2gl6d4,B_S_O_D,5,Fri Oct 17 15:15:44 2014 UTC,What's your routine? That's some crazy gains. Nice job.
Brogress,2gl6d4,iX1911,8,Tue Sep 16 20:25:51 2014 UTC,All I can say is squats. I changed from squatting once a week to 3 times a week and changed my leg day so that Squats take around 80% of my routine. So I might go anywhere from 6 to 10 sets of heavy squats. Then end my leg day with either light leg presses or leg extensions. Sometimes i vary with front squats depending on how I feel. I don't train my hamstrings on these days because deadlift days destroy my hammies enough.
Brogress,2gl6d4,romanagr,2,Tue Sep 16 20:35:55 2014 UTC,"Nice, I don't know what's wrong with me but my legs are basically shot after 2 or 3 sets. I guess I need to do more."
Brogress,2gl6d4,ballandabiscuit,1 point,Wed Sep 17 00:16:13 2014 UTC,Experiment with more sets and see if you get better results. I can almost guarantee that 2 or 3 sets will not be enough for maximum hypertrophy.

I'm currently 5'8 and 230 and I can't tell you how much I envy your progress man. Your post was truly inspiring and I know I'll keep coming back to it over my weight loss. Thanks so much for posting.   Couple questions. You lost a lot of weight. What did you do about clothes during that time? Did you buy some new clothes every 30lbs or something or just tough it out til you got to your goal weight? I worry I'll finally get down to my goal weight, buy a whole new wardrobe and then want to bulk and my clothes won't fit. Do you think this will be a problem? Also, any issues with loose skin? I want to buy some dumb bells and a weight bench for home. Can you recommend a good weight routine to get me started?   Thanks for the post. And good luck on everything"
Brogress,2g27n3,TreighS,1 point,Thu Sep 11 10:53:15 2014 UTC,"For clothes: I pretty much waited until I was totally done losing weight, then I bought a bunch of clothes. I bought smalls and mediums smalls for when i cut and mediums for when I bulk.  As for loose skin I didn't really have  a problem because im young and I guess I have good genetics for losing loose skin. A good weight routine would be SL 5x5 or Starting Strength.

A few questions, as I'm roughly at your before weight like one of the other dudes here.  1) You said during your cut you did a lot of cardio. How much?  2) Did you lift during your cut too?  3) Did you eat really clean during your cut, or just focused on high protein and 1900 calories?   4) (Not really a question, more curiosity) You said you were drinking heavily 2-3 times per week, and your post says you're 18. Do you live in an area with lax liquor laws/regulations? I live in Salt Lake City, and well... liquor laws are nuts out here. Zion curtains and whatnot.  Anyway, congrats on the results man!

Lots of lean protein / whey / chicken breast / steak. Oats and rice. Eggs, peanut butter ect. Vegetables like broccoli.

Brogress,2fy7mv,imgkz,4,Wed Sep 10 04:01:14 2014 UTC,"Thanks man. Yea I do meal preps whenever I have time to do so. The prep itself consists of cooking about 6-8 pounds of chicken on the grill, then about 4-5 cups of rice white or brown. I measure out the portions and put them into tupperware and then I put frozen veggies in with to fill the rest of the container. Once I heat it in the microwave it steams the veggies.  As for in between meals I eat anything from eggs, peanut butter, whole avocados, bowl of oats ect... On days I dont have prepped meals I eat the foods I just said and I'll also grab a chipotle bowl, just enough so I can make another prep."

Brogress,2fxsz5,ghostabdi,5,Wed Sep 10 00:58:34 2014 UTC,"TL;DR if you don't want to read a wall of text:  Was 225, lost 50 lbs, gained 10.  Torso comparison.  Arm comparison.  Back picture.  Begin actual post  In the summer of 2012 I came to a startling realization while standing in front of my bathroom mirror; I was fat and out of shape. It was at this point that I decided to start dropping some pounds. Initially, after some very brief research, I started a) drinking lots of water to help with cravings and b) tracking what I ate using MyFitnessPal. Using the app made a huge difference; for the first time I realized just how many calories were in some of the snacks that I was mindlessly eating. For the majority of my weightloss, I was eating around 1500 calories/day, down from my estimated TDEE of around 2300.  I had periods of relapse and re-deiting, however the general trend in my weight was definitively downward. By July of 2013, a year after I initially started my transformation, I had lost almost 50 lbs on the dot. Now that my weight was pretty much under control, I decided it would be a good time to actually start building some muscle. The only issue is that I did not do nearly enough research into it, and just thought it would be enough to half-assedly do some exercising now and again. So it was that I began doing an idiotic regimen of bodyweight exercises based in my screwed-up idea of what would make me stronger. Unfortunately, I didn't keep my sheet where I tracked my exercises, but essentially I would do a full-body routine once or twice a week. However, I had no idea about hypertrophy, progressive difficulty, or what forms endurance. Due to this, I just kept trying to do more and more in a row of the same type of exercises. This idiotic workout plan combined with my complete lack of knowledge regarding necessary nutrition for gaining muscle mass led to less than satisfying results.  After the first few months without a ton to show for it, I decided to do a little bit more research. It was at this point that I discovered /r/bodyweightfitness, and with it, the idea that I'd need to progress through more and more difficult exercises as my body adapted to be able to see real improvement. I found startbodyweight.com, and while I liked their progressions, I wasn't a fan of their chart. So I used my modest graphic design skills to whip up one just for myself. However, though I was starting to get the picture, I was still shockingly unaware of how largely nutrition factors into building muscle. Disregarding this though, I was able to make some progress by the July after this. I had gained about 10 lbs, and went from doing Bulgarian Split Squats to Advanced Shrimp Squats, barely able to do 4 half-pullups to doing 3x4 Dead-hang Pullups, Decline Pike Pushups to Raised Wall Handstand Pushups, Decline Diamond Pushups to One Arm Pushups, and from Side Planks to Wall Planks.  It was then that I discovered /r/fitness, and with it both the reasons for good nutrition and the advantages that I would see from hitting up a gym. I began eating better and trying to come close to my protein macros, as well as keeping my carbs and fats in check. While I still didn't have access to a gym, I knew I would at my university in September, so I started doing my research.  This brings me up to date. I've just finished my first week of Starting Strength at my university gym, and I'm hooked. While I looked at my bodyweight routine as a necessary chore, I didn't enjoy the actual process or expending the time doing it. However, I've been absolutely loving going to the gym. Something about being able to have more defined progression combined with the atmosphere has me hooked. I've been using Jefit to track my lifts so far and it seems to work very well. My lifts are predictably bad as my body adapts to the lifts and their respective forms, but I'm really enjoying myself, and honestly am looking forward to spending more time in the gym. My current stats are:  Squat: 3x5 140 lbs  Bench: 3x5 105 lbs  OHP: 3x5 75 lbs  DL: 1x5 135 lbs  I generally aim for about 2600 kcal per day, with 160g protein. Unfortunately I'm on a strict university meal plan, so I'm not allowed to cook my own food, or buy much other than whey, milk, and eggs and some breakfast products outside of what I purchase from the university's restaurants.  And here I am today, though I still feel like I'm just starting, I've definitely had significant improvement from 2 years ago, and what makes me the most excited is looking forward another 2 years.  Torso comparison.  Arm comparison. (a few months old pic, but my arm hasn't changed too dramatically since then)  Back picture. (sorry for lack of comparison and shitty quality, I only found out how to take the picture solo a few days ago)"
Brogress,2fxsz5,lukaslegi,1 point,Tue Sep 9 20:13:28 2014 UTC,"Maybe I'm totally wrong here, but your deadlift should probably be a fair bit higher than your squat. I'm a pretty new lifter (just started again), and my squat is at 100 (110 last week, but went down to correct form), while my deadlift is at 140. If I remember other people's progress, their deadlift is almost always their highest lift by a fair bit."
Brogress,2fxsz5,ghostabdi,1 point,Tue Sep 9 21:00:10 2014 UTC,"It should be, and probably will be, but I've only just started actually doing powerlifts at the gym, so i haven't had time to balance the muscles out yet. I have already build up my quads and glutes through a lot of biking and taekwondo, so they may be disproportionate currently."
Brogress,2fxsz5,lukaslegi,2,Tue Sep 9 22:30:07 2014 UTC,"Since you're probably still making 10 lb increases in your squat every work out, consider doing a 15-20 lb jump for your deadlift. You should be able to handle it at that weight still. Most people can add 20 lb to their first few deadlifts as it is."
Brogress,2fxsz5,ayjayred,3,Tue Sep 9 23:23:20 2014 UTC,"From the looks of things, once you get a feel for the weights you are lifting, your squats and deadlifts will increase pretty quickly.

Brogress,2fvfv1,Eldwick,6,Tue Sep 9 03:10:00 2014 UTC,"I started out the first month and a half lifting 3 days a week with a full body high rep (8-12) routine, running 2-3 days a week, and eating very clean. The past month and a half I have switched to SL5x5 adding dips, pull ups, and 21's. I've also unfortunately drastically cut down on cardio in the past month and started eating more dirty in an effort to bulk."

Plus I'm tensing in the second pic (for a girl) my diet consisted of pretty much staying away from sugar, eating most of my carbs in the morning (none at night).  Normally I would wake up with a protein shake, multivitamin, and fish oil. Get ready then have breakfast which was often bacon, eggs and toast.   Morning tea: 2x cans of tuna with crackers and piece of fruit (usually apple)  Lunch: Chicken and salad wraps or rolls which I couldn't avoid because I'm in the navy and you get what they give you or u buy your own.   Afternoon tea: 2x tuna again.   Dinner: Bulk meat, (usually chicken) some veggies (heaps of broccoli), and salad again along with cheese because I love cheese.   Workout ~hour or so after dinner  Pre-workout: C4 cellucore  Intra-workout: Xtend Post-workout (proie): 100% whey gold standard. 2 scoops. Mixed with 5g of BSC creatine.  Before bed: 1 scoop casein protein. (For sleep gains)  I would drink HEAPS of water and sometimes diet coke or whatever, I would have one cheat meal on a Friday afternoon but made sure I didn't go too crazy. I also cut drinking grog WAY down to like 2 a weekend. (This was the hardest).  As for routine I followed various bodybuilding.com plans but found jim stoppanis shortcut to shred was a killer! And I also would ride my bike on Sundays or some other cardio... Bulk cardio.   Good Luck!"

One month later I switched to a 6 day split workout (extremely bad decision, my body couldn't cope with that level of exercise). All this time I was slow cutting (also stupid, I switched to slow bulking after that). About 2 months ago I decided to go back to the All Pro Beginner Workout (full body workout) and have been doing that with 30 minutes of abs on my rest days (tuesday/thursday) ever since.

I lost a ton of weight. I then switched to fencing, the sport I did in undergrad, and lifted to compliment that.  Finally I was lifting 4x a week and pole 2x a week, with practically no cardio. I tried a bunch of different programs this past year, a bunch of different gyms, and a couple countries! So I'm extra glad / amazed that I've made so much progress with how hard it's been to get a regular schedule.

Brogress,2fg690,chanandler_bong__,3,Thu Sep 4 14:46:41 2014 UTC,"I seriously advise you not to gain fat so fast. It's going to hinder the definition of your muscles, produce more estrogen (fat produces estrogen) and slow your muscle gain.   If you start with a very low body fat, cherish that - many guys wish they had that. Then be patient and do a lean bulk - aim for 2 lbs a month gain. You'll gain almost all muscle and will look incredible in a year - and won't even need to go on cutting phase."
Brogress,2fg690,chanandler_bong__,1 point,Sun Sep 7 19:25:22 2014 UTC,In hindsight I know you are right. I have recently been reading up on bulking myself and realised that the massive bulking people in this subreddit supports are far from optimal. I will say tho that I feel better about going to the gym since the fat gives me a false sense of progress! But I will definitly try to cut down and stay as close to 300 over my recomended daily intake as possible. I would rather stay in shape all throughout the year than have to spend 3 months cutting while not gaining as much :)   Thank you for pointing it out tho and not only giving me what I want to hear!

The only muscles I hit were Chest, triceps, shoulders, and biceps. Once I was able to go to the gym more I did a P/P/L routine. I'm not gonna right down all the sets and reps but I focus on the main compounds for lower reps and isolation for higher reps.  Diet: My diet stayed mostly the same just eating a lot more of what I usually eat. The only dramatic changes were drinking up to 40oz of whole milk a day sometimes and a cup of either almonds or peanuts.  Pictures: First picture is about two weeks before I started lifting. The second and third pictures are from today.  Any criticism is welcome.  If anybody is curious what my max lifts were when I started: Bench 85, Squat 115, Deadlift 135."

Brogress,2f7wi4,raki27,11,Tue Sep 2 17:23:09 2014 UTC,at the time I ran cross country and track (I actually still do) and I weighed 89lbs. freshman year. I was so small I was being curled by the other skinny dudes on the team so eventually around the beginning of sophomore year I decided it was time for a change. I pretty much started working out for respect and attention from grills but I keep gaining and progressing because I like to see myself get bigger and stronger each week.
Brogress,2f7wi4,74152963741593,-18,Tue Sep 2 14:35:30 2014 UTC,"Ok, thanks, fair enough. I don't disagree you were underweight and could've used some more muscle, especially if the team sport you refer to was physical ( american football, fighting, etc,). [My primary language is not English so I don't know if being curled actually implies a particular sport.]  But to my understanding, your focus is cross and track? In this case, doesn't being this big hinder you? I mean, it's a lot to carry.  I was asking if there was a reason because, at least to the information that you've presented, there's no practicality (in my opinion), in your position, to be this big.  To lay the cards on the table, i'm suggesting that, considering what's mentioned earlier, going this big might be an overcompensation for what you lacked previously (respect and girl attention). This is fairly common in bodybuilding, but it only fakes a solution. The fact that you feel the need to progress further might mean the underlying is not resolved.  If you'd wake up tomorrow morning and you'd be 120, would you feel less confident? Or if you'd wake up 170 and ripped as fuck, would you feel more confident?"

Brogress,2f7cek,blank101,1 point,Tue Sep 2 22:12:33 2014 UTC,"Yes, PT exercises do help your core but won't adjust that disc back to proper alignment.  The amazing thing about the body is that it always adapts and heals itself under the right conditions.  Thus, you feeling better doesn't necessarily mean that your problem has been resolved.   There are over 200 different types of chiropractic techniques.  I'm not sure what kind of adjustments your chiro gave you, but sacral occipital technique will definitely help.   It focuses on tractioning your pelvic and lower back muscles allowing the disc to gradually ""slip"" back into place.   A little more specific than your ""rack 'em and crack 'em"" typical chiros."

Brogress,2f7cek,johnny_gunn,6,Mon Sep 1 22:21:33 2014 UTC,I was thinking 11-12%.  Everyone is a little different so it's hard to be sure without a test.

Brogress,2f7cek,byAnarchy,2,Mon Sep 1 23:44:31 2014 UTC,"Yeah, hips/lower belly store the last of your fat it looks like.   You are low - probably below 10% though.  You don't get abs like that at 12.  You are probably going to go to about 7-8% before you lose that lower belly but honestly you are looking pretty solid now.  I would say more mass on your shoulders is more important than cutting lower.  You are moving into the slow tedious stubborn cut land."

Brogress,2elx6f,ahh_salmon_skin_roll,2,Thu Aug 28 04:29:58 2014 UTC,"I would drop calorie intake about 300 then a additional 100 per week. At the same time I increased protein proton broton brotein intake 30 grams and then a additional 30 grams a week. I lost low amount of lbs, sometimes I had even had minimal weight gain. If your new to lifting you can gain muscle on a cut. My gains of muscle during the cut were greatly smaller than during the bulk. But, hey building muscle and cutting fat will transform your body. Much more difficult to achieve bigger lifts during a cut. But, then again my cuts aren't nearly as deep as a crash diet. After my 21 day cuts, I slowly bring my calories back up to bulk, the same way and pace I cut by. Its called reverse dieting. Cuts are easier to follow when the cut is lighter. You can gain muscle and lift bigger weights, while dropping fat. My dietary fat intake stayed static. I found you don't need to focus on protein during a bulk nearly as much as on a cut. My routine during cuts include daily low-intensity cardio and the same weightlifting programs as the bulk, for the most part. I love to bike, thats my preferred cardio."
Brogress,2elx6f,ahh_salmon_skin_roll,2,Thu Aug 28 05:58:23 2014 UTC,"Thanks, did your lifts go up during the cut, stay the same or go down?"
Brogress,2elx6f,ahh_salmon_skin_roll,2,Thu Aug 28 14:03:52 2014 UTC,"My lifts would normally flat line for most of the cut, then I would gradually pick up more. Its really easy to over train while cutting, so I never pushed up significantly heavy weight. I would train around 70% 1RM then bump to 80 then 85% 1RM. I only perform new maxed out lifts during bulks. I never deadlift during a cut. I found deadlifting during a cut to be very hard on the joints."
Brogress,2elx6f,woodenfleshbeast,2,Thu Aug 28 15:54:34 2014 UTC,Did you decrease the number of days per week of lifting? What about the number of sets for each body part?

Brogress,2egxvg,Pimping_NZ,12,Sun Aug 24 20:47:06 2014 UTC,Barely even has his noob gains.
Brogress,2egxvg,jap-a-negro,-3,Mon Aug 25 09:09:22 2014 UTC,"Short class physique, not bodybuilding. I'm the same size (with different weight distribution) as a good friend of mine who competed in June and placed fourth in a national qualifier. No, I'm not contest ready now, but I still have six months."
Brogress,2egxvg,hakujin214,4,Sun Aug 24 20:50:36 2014 UTC,How many people were in the competition where your friend placed fourth?
Brogress,2egxvg,DurianDurian,43,Mon Aug 25 06:08:28 2014 UTC,Three

Brogress,2egxvg,toki09,17,Sun Aug 24 23:30:58 2014 UTC,yea. I mean good progress. But this guy still has 2-4 years of training left before he should even mention the word competition.

Brogress,2egxvg,jefffffffff,-9,Sun Aug 24 21:29:50 2014 UTC,What is your question exactly.. Sorry it's been a long day and I'm at work. Lol.
Brogress,2egxvg,closerthanassumed,8,Sun Aug 24 21:38:00 2014 UTC,"What is the weight you push/pull on Benchpress, deadlifts, and squats?"
Brogress,2egxvg,zzfish1095,-8,Sun Aug 24 21:59:12 2014 UTC,"Due to the certain aesthetic things they look for in the physique class I've been instructed not to dead lift anymore but my max was 225 about two months ago. Squats were the same, but I've started to take it easy due to my knees being bad.. And with chest being my weakest muscle group, flat bench and incline are sitting at 155. Nothing special, nor do I brag about these."
Brogress,2egxvg,spankmyalpaca,37,Sun Aug 24 23:45:32 2014 UTC,Bodybuilding turning into r/cringe?? Fuk man. Nice progress but your no where near any contest. Use my hate to fuel yourself.

Brogress,2egxvg,Caption_Bots_Dad,5,Sun Aug 24 23:57:32 2014 UTC,"Look, I know people that have been contest ready from being skinny after only 6 months. They put on 60 pounds in 4 months and then cut down in two months and actually looked awesome. Of course, a year and a half later, they got their pro bodybuilder card. It just doesn't look like you're making that same progress. Not impossible, but you need to bulk, bulk, bulk and then cut hard. Good luck..."
Brogress,2egxvg,shred_a,1 point,Mon Aug 25 15:41:55 2014 UTC,I wouldn't dare go near a contest until I was around 185 at least at >6% bodyfat   There is no way you can get near that in only a few month
Brogress,2egxvg,Leviethen7,3,Sat Aug 30 01:15:23 2014 UTC,"Theres so many cringe worthy things about this post. But I think the saddest thing is that you don't dead lift anymore due to aesthetic reasons. Thats just the dumbest thing I've ever read, you're making a huge mistake. whoever gave you that advice, if they could hear themselves talk they would not stop throwing up."
Brogress,2egxvg,curtainmuglamp,0,Sat Aug 30 19:03:46 2014 UTC,"The reason given was one of the muscle groups targeted is your traps. I understand the benefits of deads, that's why I used to do them so much. But according the certain aesthetic things they look for in the physique class, big delts and the v taper, if you have large traps it makes you look like a diamond and therefore points are deducted. I'm not saying fuck dead lifts at all, I miss doing them. I think the clarification behind which contest class I was preparing for was missed somehow..."
Brogress,2egxvg,ThatsFair,6,Sat Aug 30 19:36:39 2014 UTC,but you have no definition in your traps at all. Go back to dead lifting.

Brogress,2egxvg,-ogre-,14,Mon Aug 25 04:13:01 2014 UTC,Great progress and all...but workout for nine months and thinking you get on stage in 6 months is an insult to all the serious physique competitors out there from amateur to pro level.
Brogress,2egxvg,phommt,-14,Mon Aug 25 02:42:23 2014 UTC,"I'm assuming you're a competitor yourself? I know plenty of competitors where I'm from (amateur) that have gotten competition ready in a year and a half. If I don't feel stage ready, I won't step on stage. That's how it is. I will be getting with a prep trainer next month and if competition season rolls around and he doesn't think I'm ready, I won't compete. Simple as that."

I gained 20 lbs of muscle in 2 months by lifting like this and eating like this! This was not a natural transformation.""   New lifters understand that they won't achieve the same growth and keep putting in hard work to achieve natural gains."

I went home for a family wedding after about 2 months of trying to gain some mass after being the runner physique and they kept commenting on how I look like I've filled into my body, and look like a grown man.  Everyone, except my grandfather, who asked if I had been eating too much because it looks like I had a beer belly. >.<"
Brogress,2ehbs6,Billytown,3,Mon Aug 25 01:07:18 2014 UTC,of course   pls don't make AAS use sound shameful. your attitude towards it is the entire reason people lie about it

Brogress,2ehbs6,Boomdoompow,-2,Sat Aug 30 01:27:12 2014 UTC,"So you want people admitting to using drugs that may be illegal and attach pictures of themselves, but it cool because ""it's for the newbies""."
Brogress,2ehbs6,Boomdoompow,7,Mon Sep 8 02:33:51 2014 UTC,"You act like thats a huge deal. It isn't. Oh wait, brb police at my door for talking about steroids on internet!   You think the police break down doors of every redditor on r/steroids? It isn't a huge deal to discuss AAS usage. I'm not asking people to provide every detail of their cycle or blast, from dosages to sources. Just a mention that the transformation wasn't natural. If you're so concerned with legality, it leaves ambiguity as to whether it were legal prohormones or banned steroids.   Don't be an ass. If you're scared of ""found out"" for using steroids, nobody will make you mention it. But that isn't helping anybody, especially when people then go on to credit it to their diet. Thats bullshit."
Brogress,2ehbs6,TO_throwaway1,2,Mon Aug 25 19:06:44 2014 UTC,"I don't think the police will be breaking down anybody's door, that doesn't mean it won't effect some other part of a guys life. If they feel comfortable admitting it they will if not why pressure them. The ""for the newbies"" annoys me, it's just something people say when they want too pretend like they don't judge dudes who use but still want too talk down too them or justify their own shitty gains. If someone is gonna quit because they don't have a six pack in two months they would have found another excuse anyways,. Acting like false natty is discouraging people from lifting is just dumb, if anything it's keeping little 16 year olds off the stuff because that's about the upper threshold of people who fall for that that bullshit. I honestly don't use the stuff I'm barley disciplined enough to follow my own diet much less run some serious chemicals the right way.  I just don't see any reason for people to expect a guy too admit to something like that for the sake of people who will probably quit anyways, or worse convince some 17 year old who has done six months of SS that he is at his ""natural limit."""

Nothing against him or anyone else that wants to get huge.  And beyond this, anyone with that kind of discipline is impressive. It just doesn't come across as very practical.   It's an idea borne out of a need to look like some exaggerated person that spends an exaggerated amount of time at the gym.  As for skinny fight club fag...I like it.  With a little more beef to him that would have been alright.    If you're trying to bait me with your comments, I do all my 'real' talking  in person.

Brogress,2e1ubp,RealResults,30,Wed Aug 20 03:51:21 2014 UTC,Personally I'd say cut. You're already quite muscular and I don't think a really bulky physique matches your height. You'll look much nicer being shredded and strong than being less defined and more stodgy.  Of course it all depends on what YOU want.

Deadlifting in lifters is a preference, some people prefer it, but it does slightly increase your range of motion (meaning the lift is harder)."

New season starts in 3 weeks and i will play the next few months again. Glad i did my cut  My diet started at around 3200 kcal and ended in the range of 2600-2700. Wasnt easy to really find a good pace and i think i  can still improve a lot in that area in the future  Bench: 3 Sets  5 Reps with 225lbs in the last weeks.  I will try my best to improve my bench, because i feel my chest lacks a lot. Compared to my lat and other parts its out of propotion. Because of some injuries in the past ( Shoulder and ankle ) i had some big issues doing bench and squats. But since around  a year i really figured out the perfect squat form. Like 2 weeks ago i finally reworked my complete bench- form and now i finally can start to put on some weight.  Squat: 3 Sets 5 Reps 315 lbs  Deadlift : 3 Sets 5 Reps ~ 380 lbs.   These are the numbers i trained with in the last weeks. So i am not sure what to expect when i finally are back to ~ 3500 kcal +.   Besides basketball getting stronger in the Big lifts will definitely be my focus in the next year. I am not satisfied with the numbers, especially compared to my own height and bodyweight. Especially the first 2 years i didnt put much focus on getting stronger. I still made some good gains, but i probably missed a big oppurtunity to build some solid base strength.

Because exercises like squats work multiple muscles (instead of isolation exercises like dumbbell curls, designed to work only one) the theory is you need a much smaller group of exercises to work your whole system.   As far as I can tell, this is to make your workout quicker, and to prevent muscle imbalances (E.G beast arms and puny legs) - which means at the end of a beginner program like SS or SL you have a great foundation to move onto bigger lifts."
Brogress,2du24d,smallnorth,2,Mon Aug 18 08:24:51 2014 UTC,Exactly. Also in a lot of programs with many exercises you work at a lower percentage of 1RM than you do in these more focused programs.

I did it for maybe a year and moved to a bodybuilding routine. But they are still my biggest muscles. In hind site I wish I would have focused more on my lacking muscles.

Tuesday - Chest, Shoulders, and Tricep  Wednesday - Legs and Abs  Thursday - Back and Bicep  Saturday - Legs and Abs  Sunday - Chest, Shoulders, and Back  Rest on Monday and Friday  Also at the end of every workout I run on the treadmill for 15 mins starting from 6 speed and increase half a speed every 3 minutes.  Bench - 200lbs 5x5.  Squats - 180lbs 5x5.  Deadlift - 220lbs 5x5 I workout at Planet Fitness so the big 3 are done on the Smith Machine  As for diets, I work in a Vietnamese restaurant so i can get my hands on varieties of meats and vegetable. I completely cut off carbs on all my meals so no rice and noodles, just vegetable and lots of meat (beef, chicken, and pork). I only count proteins so i consume about 140 to 150 grams of protein per day. I eat 5 times a day every 2 and a half to 3 hours and i try to eat as clean as i can, no fatty meats and fried food.  I will try to keep this up until the end of summer then go on a lean bulk during the fall and winter."
Brogress,2dkm99,BurrowingBob,8,Thu Aug 14 21:00:54 2014 UTC,Bench - 200lbs 5x5. Squats - 180lbs 5x5.   how come your squat is so much lower than your bench?
Brogress,2dkm99,BurrowingBob,11,Thu Aug 14 22:16:35 2014 UTC,i've been working out my upper body on and off since high school...only recently that i started leg workout

The thing is, i couldn't understand it the way u wrote it. i'm not trying to be insulting, but do u think u could write it again a bit clearer?  If thats okay i would appreciate it. Edit... Thanks mate"
Brogress,2dkm99,eleven7,2,Fri Aug 15 04:44:13 2014 UTC,crazy that your bench is higher than your squat.
Brogress,2dkm99,eleven7,2,Fri Aug 15 07:10:05 2014 UTC,Sorry not to be rude but are your abs really that staggered or is it just the lighting?

Brogress,2dkqm4,urgencyy,4,Thu Aug 14 22:27:42 2014 UTC,"5 years, although only seriously for around 3."
Brogress,2dkqm4,eagle_eye1,5,Thu Aug 14 22:35:03 2014 UTC,Looking for your individual lifts like the actual exercises for chest/back
Brogress,2dkqm4,lateatnight,3,Thu Aug 14 22:43:06 2014 UTC,"Chest/Back:  Bench press is the main focus of the chest part of the day, especially incline. 5x10 on both flat and incline bench press, then various accessory movements such as flys.  For the back part of the workout I love to do pullups, cable rows, and overhead pulls, and muscle ups for fun.  Arms and shoulders day:  Half of the workout focuses on shoulders and the other half on arms. Main focus of the shoulder portion is some variation of overhead press, combine that with lateral raises, front raises, bent over backwards flys(Idk if that's what it's called...) and whatever else I feel like doing. Then moving on to triceps, skullcrushers are the main focus of this portion. Then rope pulldowns and overhead extentions and dips. Then to biceps...bunch of curl variations, not much to say here. Then forearms, wrist curls, backwards wrist curls, stuff like that.  Finally, leg day!  Squats, loads of squats, followed by deadlifts, loads of deadlifts! Anywhere from 5x10 to 8x10 on both. Then leg extentions and curls, and lunges, and good mornings and other accessory stuff, followed by calves.  Oh also, I hit abs every other day, and calves every other day at the end of the workout, just before cardio. So if I'm doing abs, next day is calves, leg days I do both abs and calves.  Everyday 20 min of cardio. Everything 2x a week 1 day off."

Brogress,2dkqm4,narzule,3,Fri Aug 15 01:04:05 2014 UTC,"Oh I forgot to mention, I do abs and calves every other day so if I do abs one day then it's calves the next. I find those muscle groups recover extremely quickly and only a lot of volume will make them develop."
Brogress,2dkqm4,narzule,1 point,Fri Aug 15 01:06:31 2014 UTC,Can you walk me through your typical day for food? I know you listed the food but like quantity and related info.
Brogress,2dkqm4,fannymcslap,1 point,Fri Aug 15 01:27:36 2014 UTC,"ok, question.  That's really all I eat. But is yours pretty much the same meal each time?   What does your typical day of meals look like?"

Brogress,2dkqm4,ThizzelleBundchen,2,Fri Aug 15 20:42:12 2014 UTC,what type of rice? White? Brown?
Brogress,2dkqm4,detonate66,5,Fri Aug 15 20:43:23 2014 UTC,"Generally brown, but if white rice is the only thing left in the house I'll still eat it, I think people put a bit too much emphasis on white vs brown."
Brogress,2dkqm4,Two_phat,3,Fri Aug 15 20:53:35 2014 UTC,"Saw your post on /r/bodybuilding, your progress is amazing. At 19, you have a great foundation."
Brogress,2dkqm4,JK635,2,Sat Aug 16 06:16:13 2014 UTC,"Did you eat similarly during your bulking phases? (chicken, broccoli, rice) and do you take fish oil or multi-vitamins, etc.?   Also, what lifting routines did you follow or like the best during your cuts and bulks?"
Brogress,2dkqm4,twilz,1 point,Thu Aug 14 22:41:58 2014 UTC,"Yup, I just eat a lot more of it, and I add in snacks like granola bars and stuff. Oh and I love eating peanut butter xD  I just take a basic multi-vitamin.  I like Arnold's blueprint routine for cutting and bulking, I altered it to fit my personal goals and I shave off some of the volume while I cut."
Brogress,2dkqm4,JK635,1 point,Thu Aug 14 23:07:52 2014 UTC,Alright thanks for the info man. It's awesome to know you can get such good results from such a simple diet. Keep it up man!
Brogress,2dkqm4,urgencyy,1 point,Fri Aug 15 00:20:36 2014 UTC,Can you elaborate on Arnold's cutting/bulking blueprint?
Brogress,2dkqm4,Fangqaz,1 point,Fri Aug 15 15:22:25 2014 UTC,"Nothing much to say, just remove some of the volume while you are cutting. Listen to your body and do what feels right. If you can do full volume while cutting, more power to you. I can on occasion, but generally I don't because I feel like I don't recover as well."

Brogress,2djl4b,boastfulbadger,3,Thu Aug 14 16:35:06 2014 UTC,Starting strength builds a great foundation. Afterwards you can pick different programs based on your goals
Brogress,2djl4b,breadmaniowa,1 point,Thu Aug 14 17:22:14 2014 UTC,Thank you! I'm going to keep reading up on this!
Brogress,2djl4b,Sverje,1 point,Thu Aug 14 17:39:51 2014 UTC,I am looking at taking a weight training course and modeling the routine after that or PHAT.
Brogress,2djl4b,Sverje,8,Thu Aug 14 16:51:58 2014 UTC,Fuck toning. Continue your deficit and start PHAT with 1 or 2 fewer sets on each exercise. Push pull legs as an alternative routine.  Solid brogress
Brogress,2djl4b,jefffffffff,3,Thu Aug 14 16:36:47 2014 UTC,"I'm really interested in PHAT, but can I ask why you'd suggest doing a few less sets?"
Brogress,2djl4b,polarpack,2,Thu Aug 14 16:51:00 2014 UTC,"If you are an inexperienced lifter you might have trouble keeping up with the program as far as recovery goes. If you feel like you can handle it though, i see no reason not to.  The frequency, intensity and volume balance in PHAT is imo optimal for getting strong and big as a noob.   SS is a joke compared to PHAT if you're going for aestethics."
Brogress,2djl4b,greenman27,1 point,Thu Aug 14 17:41:23 2014 UTC,Thank you! I'm looking to take a weight training course this semester where we design and implement our own routines. This is great advice.

Brogress,2dh38v,BurtReynoldsWrap,6,Thu Aug 14 14:32:42 2014 UTC,Stats. I did SS for three months and PHAT for the remaining three. That's why the bench and OHP is lagging.

Just be as aggressive in the kitchen as you are in the gym and you'll gain.   I'm actually taking my younger causin to the gym with me. He's reeeeaally skinny, but has alway been athletic. He's on a gainer, watching his sleep and various other recovery chemicals to make sure his body doesn't burn the muscles he's working so much for.  I think he gained like 11lbs last month. Now that's just insane amount of gains for an ottermode type. I'll get his supplement list if you'd like to"

I've always trained solely for bodybuilding, I'd say even after I added powerlifting days to my program it was still a bodybuilding regimen; however, I'm joining my university's PL team, so it's time to gain some serious strength. I've never been above 10-12% body fat. I follow IIFYM and ate 3,500+ a day before cutting a bit, and now I'm clean bulking at 3,200 for the entirety of my college freshman year."

I mainly did this because I feel that my lower body is already thick enough, and I also thought that the original PHAT programming could use a little more shoulders and arms. Just my 2 cents though."

As far as pull-up progression goes, anything that hits the lats will help.

Brogress,2dcdbu,datspectersmile,3,Tue Aug 12 16:35:38 2014 UTC,"Thanks!  For my program I started off with a 5x5 to build basic strength, and typically followed that up until I adopted a different program with more variation. The 5x5 was most often squat, bench, and deadlift, with bent over rows, seated military press, and lat pull downs rotated in.  After a while I began taking creatine and lifting more regularly, adding in various auxiliary lifts as I felt I needed them, up until The point where I had to adopt a standardized program for athletics.   The program I was following when I got to the point I was at in the picture with the sombrero was basically: (every other day) squat, leg extensions, leg curls, seated and standing calves, and weighted lunges rotated in, bench (switching between incline, and flat), curls, seated row, and DB fly, followed by box jumps and abdominals (crunches, flutter kicks, leg throws, 3x50, 4x30, and 4x25 respectively). The sets and reps would go on a rotation, 4x6, 4x8, and 4x10.   I stuck with the program up until I injured my ankle, and then once I could lift again, I began Arnold's blueprint and  have loosely followed that for  the past few months.   I couldn't even begin to try and describe my diet, I don't necessarily count my macros, but have a general idea of how many grams of carbs, protein, and how many calories I should have been consuming. A lot of chicken breast and rice, eggs and oatmeal for breakfast usually, and with dinner it's hard to say, I was on a meal plan at my uni.   I've always been rather skinny and have had trouble putting on any sort of weight at all, and when I began treatment for my ADHD mid 2013, the Adderall made it difficult to eat and meet my macros, so I was often on a caloric deficit. So I never really went through a bulk/cut phase. I'd like to, but I really lack the discipline to eat enough for a bulk."

Brogress,2d5yjy,ixaltairxi,16,Sun Aug 10 20:29:43 2014 UTC,"Alright. So I was 19 in the first picture. Originally started lifting because I wanted to gain aesthetic size and was into bodybuilding for about a year. But I soon realized how difficult it was to make size gains for someone my height (or taller). I got discouraged and kind of switched my sights towards powerlifting and I love it a whole lot more than bodybuilding.   I train 4 times a week. Squat, bench, deadlift, and the fourth day is for things I need to work on. Recently it's been shoulder strength. I eat 3000-3500 call a day. I've gone on two cuts since I started, but don't plan on cutting again for a long time.   My current max lifts are (s/b/d) 455lbs, 300lbs, 550lbs, but I have a meet coming up shortly and I expect to hit PRs in all my lifts."

When did you make the switch to powerlifting? and do you only squat/bench/dl once per week? if so, what's the routine? do you feel your vanity muscles have ""suffered"" aesthetically bc of this?  sorry for the questions, but at 183lbs i get discouraged also with being so tall and not getting fat while trying to put on size"
Brogress,2d5yjy,oppressedshitlord,1 point,Mon Aug 11 01:48:52 2014 UTC,"Let's see. For about the first year, I didn't know a damn thing about diet or nutrition. So when I began to educate myself on that, I decided to cut and restart on a clean slate. I cut for about 4 months doing intermittent fasting. Worked decently well, though I think I lost quite a bit of muscle in the process. The second cut was after two peak cycles of powerlifting training. I just ate a little less, focusing more on not losing strength. That was about 3 months from Feb to early May this year. I have been bulking ever since, but slowly because I don't want to get very fat.   Thanks for the compliments. I think I am lean around my waist because I carry most weight in my legs and ass. I always have. I'm not that lean, like 15-17%, but it's pretty ideal for me since I'm a powerlifter.   I switched to powerlifting about 3 months after my first cut. I found it incredibly hard to make any kind of size gains being so tall, like you are experiencing. Also I'm naturally a good deadlifter and my squat wasn't bad to start off with. I started doing workouts focusing on those lifts and began to make great strength gains. I liked that the strength gains came wayyyyy faster than the size for me. Ultimately, that's what got me hooked. Also I figured that with strength, size will come.   As far as my routine... Every day is very similar: I have a squat day, bench day, deadlift day and a misc day. I work my way up to one set of a heavy triple, double or single (depending on how close to a meet I am). All bench reps are paused. Deadlifts are beltless the first 6 weeks. I start to wrap up on squats 3 weeks out. Then two accessory exercises, lots of sets at about 70% my max for low reps. Then maybe something else if I have time. Face pulls are my favorite. The fourth day is more like a bodybuilding routine for strength imbalances.   The vanity muscles question... I honestly don't feel like my vanity muscles were good in the first place. I basically started from scratch when I started powerlifting. I have never had a good looking chest and I have had a hell of a time building my arms. Even when I was super lean I didn't really have a 6 pack or anything. I really just wasn't made to be a bodybuilder. I posted a front pic below, so you can see for yourself."

Brogress,2czk52,DTDtwopoint0,11,Fri Aug 8 16:42:42 2014 UTC,The darker color shows more definition and prevents you from getting washed out in the bright lights. Offstage those trunks are bright orange and my skin was Kenya black but under the lights everything is a lot lighter
Brogress,2czk52,ArBROgast,1 point,Fri Aug 8 16:59:24 2014 UTC,"I 100% agree with this. For my first show, I used a relatively light tan, which made me look absolutely washed out under the lights (albeit the lighting was completely horrendous at that show), so for my next two, just in case, I went hella dark, and it definitely paid off. Much better to be too dark than too light in most cases."

Not an overabundance of rest time, lifting took me an hour or less which is pretty quick for me.  30 minutes of cardio 5 times a week. Treadmill on 15% incline at 3.0 mph, heart rate right around 130.

I've been doing a full body routine 3 or 4 times a week depending on my schedule. Aiming for every exercise I do to be 10 reps with a weight where the 11th would be very difficult. Average work out is about 1 hour. When I started out I could barely do 1 chin up.  As for supps all I use is the cheapest protein I can find on the internet (3 scoops on training day, 2 on rest days) and creatine. I try and eat healthy and get in some protein.

Brogress,2cvuwt,lawoodii,2,Thu Aug 7 19:27:40 2014 UTC,I found pull ups/chin ups to be very beneficial. Its easy to see progress in the amount you can do. They are tough with such long arms and a large amount of a tall guy's bodyweight is not muscle. Plus I feel I built some good muscle mass from doing them
Brogress,2cvuwt,sexybec,1 point,Thu Aug 7 23:11:22 2014 UTC,Is it hard for you to find bars that are high enough to do them? How tall are those dips/chin up/pull up stations? Nice progress :)

Brogress,2cwqwq,tway1253,0,Thu Aug 7 19:05:07 2014 UTC,"This would make a great one of those puzzles where you have to find 5 differences between 2 pictures.    Shorts are a different color Stomach is bloated on the left   ??? I'm stumped about the other 3.  Take a look at the top posts of all time on this subreddit, of the top 25 of only 3 are shorter than a 1 year period. And all of those 3 posts people cutting weight after long periods of training and bulking. Even in those cutting posts, not a single one is 2 months or shorter.  Significant progress (in terms of muscle building) cannot be made in 2 months by anyone, even with performance enhancing drugs. Go back to the gym, lift for the next year, stay disciplined with your diet and sleep, and then you will have some real progress to show.  This isn't to say that you shouldn't be proud of gaining weight for your own health, but that isn't brogress."
Brogress,2cwqwq,ZCount,2,Thu Aug 7 19:54:43 2014 UTC,I do intend on showing some progress after a year and I realize that 2 months isn't enough time to see significant gains.

Brogress,2cwqwq,bluecollarworker,1 point,Thu Aug 7 20:35:51 2014 UTC,Honestly I can barely tell a difference. Maybe if you hadn't eaten so many calories.

But the maximum amount of muscle a beginner can gain per month is 1.5-2.25lbs per month (citation needed). Assuming you gained the maximum, 20lbs of that 25 you gained is fat.  If you busted ass for 2 months at the gym I would be more interested in your lift numbers, because you can make significant progress in that area as a beginner. How have you progressed with chin-ups? How have your sets to failure improved? Etc."

I don't really know what my lift numbers are at the moment, but before the cut it was 150kg deadlift, 130kg squat and I have never tried maxing out on bench but I did 8x80kg for three sets before my cut.   I have been going to the gym for about 1.5 years, with a few breaks every now and then for 1-2 months. In the best of worlds there would be no breaks but unfortunately I have school and other things that come in the way.  Hopefully the remaining months of this year and the entire next year will be without breaks.  And when it comes to routine I usually just go for back/bi, chest/tri/shoulder and legs/abs. I don't really have a schedule that says I am going to do chest on mondays. I work out as often as I can, and I will listen to my body if it feels like I need to rest a day or two.   My diet consists mostly of chicken, broccoli and bulgur. I do use protein powder and amino acids sometimes, too. I probably had a cheat day once a week while on the cut. Some weeks I would have two cheats days and some weeks I would have none.  Again, I am tired so please let me know if I missed anything or if this is in any way confusing to read. Thanks!"

I thought just soap was fine, but it wasn't until I used a loofah and soap to scrub my body that the acne started to calm down. Try to shower as soon as possible after working out. Also you can try a salicylic acid product, for example: Stridex acne pads. Use these after your shower after you work out over all the trouble areas and it should help.   Check out /r/skincareaddiction if you have more questions or you can ask me  Also nice work on the gains! :)"

Brogress,2cikp0,DPRegular,16,Sun Aug 3 18:42:41 2014 UTC,"My Workout (non) Schedule (by req)  I made this chart! when I was studying how working out affected my weight and how my weight affected my ""bad"" cholesterol, but it works perfectly here. As one whose interests gravitate towards research, I am the subject of my own experiments, so, as much as possible, I record EVERYTHING.   The Graph explained  The cyan lines mark workouts. For the 4-yr period in question, I went to the gym 148 times.  (BTW, the height of each line is the number of minutes I worked out divided by 2 plus 100. So, for the very 1st group, I only worked out 36 minutes.)  What it shows  So that 148 number works out to an average of 3.08 visits per month. Note that between Dec 2010 and Jul 2011, there were only 2 gym visits and the second was aborted. This was because I was on a low carb diet and losing weight. Truth is I had NO energy for the gym. The studies show that about 1/3 of people do not adapt well to low carb; I'm one of them. When I eat more carbs I feel SO MUCH MORE ENERGETIC!   So, if you take out those 8 months, I averaged 3.65 gym visits per month. BUT, and this is a very important but, at the end of that weight loss period, I looked like a concentration camp refugee! Losing weight - even on a high protein diet - (prob because I didn't workout) made me lose all my muscle. And I did develop it starting at the very advanced -- ;) -- age of 66.  So, if you look at my ""before"" picture, I am very pudgy, but there was some good muscle underneath that flab in my arms and shoulders. If I'da gone to the gym, I probably woulda just had to lose the fat to reveal it. So, yes, I had to start over and did develop that body working out a little less than once a week.  The lesson here is that all the supplements, workout hoopla, complicated workout plans, etc, are only necessary for hypertrophy. For the average person just wanting to be fit, it doesn't take much time at the gym."

Brogress,2cikp0,reddituser00000,5,Sun Aug 3 20:31:36 2014 UTC,"Good point! Still, I believe the only reason to do the supps, hoopla, etc, is if you can't make any further strength gains. Even if you're impatient, it's prob best to go slower, have more patience and give your body a chance to strengthen in connective tissue, which is slower to build than muscle.  Of course, if you're a teenager with hormones through the roof, you are in a golden window of opportunity --- ride it to the max!"

One of the reasons I initially started trying to get fit because of this video (and of course getting ripped has it's own benefits) and you are pretty much what I'm aiming for right now, let alone when I'm 69.  Also your graph is great.  Brilliant job on this :)"
Brogress,2cikp0,MarmaladeChainsaw,3,Sun Aug 3 23:10:16 2014 UTC,"aww, gosh, thanks! :)  But I'm not convinced I'm anything special on this. Bear with me for a moment as I crank the numbers. So, starting on Jul 2011 as I worked my way back from a minuscule amount of muscle, that spans a period of 3 years.  If you look at What’s My Genetic Muscular Potential? you see the McDonald Model predicts  Year        Potential Rate of Muscle Gain per Year  1   --  20-25 pounds (2 pounds per month)  2   --  10-12 pounds (1 pound per month)  3   --  5-6 pounds (0.5 pound per month)  4+  -   2-3 pounds (not worth calculating)  or 40 lbs of muscle for the 3 years. But this is prob for a 70 kg man and I'm only 50, so that should prob be more like 30 lbs. But look at the paragraph following the chart. I read that as saying if you're older or don't train ""properly"" you haven't used up that 1st year, newbie potential ... so in other words, you just do it slower, but you arrive at the same place. But wait, there's more!! there's no way I've tapped my whole 30 lbs of muscle potential. I would guess I've added maybe 20-25 lbs and I can still put on another 5-10.  Slower ... yes, no prob! ... slow and steady wins the day.   Now if I were all hypertrophied up after 1 year, then I would believe I was special."

As someone around 180 and 6'2"" who still looks pretty stick thin I can tell you that your system may work for smaller bodies but as you go up your advice for the average reduces in effectiveness. You don't have to spend all week at the gym but on one day my body forgets it even did anything. 3 is about the minimum for me to look even remotely okay."
Brogress,2cikp0,losingprogress,3,Mon Aug 4 11:06:54 2014 UTC,"Very interesting! The opposite experience of my current. But lets not jump to hasty conclusions here as to cause; not sure height is most likely. Also, between your experience and mine, we have a sample size of exactly 2, how do we know which of us is closer to the average?  But going back a little bit, when I was in my 30s, I could go to the gym 3x per week and make gains on almost each visit - better on Mondays than Fridays. But by my 50s, WO every other day would produce no gain, I had to leave at least 3 rest days between - although I never tried working different body parts because I'm not interested in hypertrophy. Now at almost 70, I need even more rest between visits.  So, looking at cause, some candidates other than height might be:   age % BF - or more likely, size of base muscle mass how long that muscle mass has been in place how much you use your muscles between gym visits how deeply you stress your muscles at ea gym visit diet genetics metabolic speed whether you are gaining weight or losing weight whether you vary your diet immediately after WOs amount / quality of sleep ... anything else I haven't thought of"

I just did a 2 mile personal best in 20 min, which is no big deal except that it includes a 400 foot climb.  As I mentioned in the WO sched post w the graph, I lost weight with a lowish-carb diet for the 1st year. Then I started reading more about LC diets and discovered they could produce diabetes and were not optimal for aspiring athletes. NOt only that, for my weight, my ""bad"" cholesterol was WAY too high. I tried a little experiment substituting a little beans for for fat calories and was stunned to see a further (unintentional) weight drop, I think, because I was actually satisfied eating less.  I cut way back on sat fat which helped some. Still concerned about the diabetes potential, in Jan 2014, I gave myself a home glucose tolerance test and was dismayed to find my BG over 250 and not coming down.From all appearances, I had made myself diabetic with this diet and I had lost my tolerance for glucose. This was at 25% protein, 50% fat and 25% carb.  Long story short, dug into pubmed to see if this was really the prob and if there was a solution. Yes to both. I changed my diet -- very, slowly and carefully -- to 23% P, 22% F, 55% C by replacing fat cals with whole (as in all parts present) and whole (as in cellurlarly intact)  low GI legumes, veggies and fruit.  As I gradually replaced fat with carbs, I had to keep up walk/running up the hill to burn off the added glucose cuz my body wasn;t making any insulin, and this was a major fitness shift for me. My legs got really strong and I lost another 2 lbs.  Then I discovered that milk protein (among other things you wouldn't want to ingest) has growth hormones in it to cause the calves to put on weight. I had been eating a lot of yogurt so I cut casein out of my diet and lost another 3 lbs. In 10 days!  So, cellularly intact, low GI means little to no processing of foods and don't cook the veggies too much - el dante. Cooking raises the GI.   Here's a typical day:  breakfast: Costco salmon patty, avocado and beans  snack: beans and soy protein patty that I make w TVP, spinach & egg whites  lunch: eggwhites, fruit, chia seed  dinner 1: salad with Costco ""power greens"", tomatoes, avocados, carrot, dried cranberries, soy protein patty, lemon / mustard derssing  dinner 2: soup with green leafy's, potato, carrot, butternut squash, mushrooms, marinara sauce, soy protein patty  snack: soy milk, hemp protein powder, fruit smooothy"

Brogress,2cfju7,Connor_Menees,-8,Sun Aug 3 01:35:19 2014 UTC,Well calories from protein will feed your muscles better than calories from fat and carbs. Most people get enough or more than enough carbs and fats already  EDIT: to feed your muscles to make them bigger
Brogress,2cfju7,scarfox1,12,Sun Aug 3 01:39:57 2014 UTC,"Bro, do you even science? Protein does not 'feed' your muscles more effectively than carbs. Carbs are what 'feed' your cellular engine (if they're available). They are broken down into glucose, which is then used to create ATP, the substance that provides most of the fuel for cells.  Protein (and the essential amino acids within that protein) are what your body uses to make structural and functional components of muscle. This is necessary for creation of new muscle cells, or improvement of existing muscle cells."
Brogress,2cfju7,raoulk,-2,Sun Aug 3 01:49:06 2014 UTC,"Yes, sorry by fuel I meant fuel to make more muscle, not fuel to work the muscles. Protein is needed to make your muscles bigger. Which is why I recommended 1g/lb so he can make his arms and shoulders bigger. That was my bad."
Brogress,2cfju7,ZCount,3,Sun Aug 3 02:09:36 2014 UTC,"You just read that somewhere...  Not much science to back it up.

Brogress,2ccni0,Sp33d0J03,3,Sat Aug 2 12:31:32 2014 UTC,Awesome body. Just awesome but man. It was worth it just for that jaw line.
Brogress,2ccni0,74152963741593,3,Sat Aug 2 15:09:40 2014 UTC,"Great inspiration, man. I'm a former obese man still in the process of losing his last 40 lbs. of weight and while I'm jealous I myself really inspired by your progress.   Any tricks or advice for one trying to make the transition from obese/overweight to buff dude?"
Brogress,2ccni0,almondbutter1,11,Sat Aug 2 03:15:22 2014 UTC,"Not be afraid to fail. WHen i first started i wanted to give up a lot cause i was afraid i couldn't handle it, i ended up skipping meals, skipping workouts, feeling like a failure. But i then i heard the qoute "" Being a failure and failing at something is completely different things. Failing is something you do cause you tried. Being a failure is the result of never trying in the first place.""   So my advice to you is, dont be afraid to make mistakes, everyone fails sometime, it just a matter of getting up and getting back on track when that happens. :)"
Brogress,2ccni0,GreyNietzsche,2,Sat Aug 2 06:35:29 2014 UTC,Failing and being a failure I never thought about it like that. There is a difference that is a total opposite. Thank you for this post it's really inspired me to fail but not be a failure :)

The lack of progress from 2013-2014 is really frustrating, because you can see all of what little weight gain there is went into my legs (Which I started working out regularly in the beginning of 2013 only). So if I do the same as last year I should make exactly zero progress til next summer?"
Brogress,2c7tpg,meridiem,8,Thu Jul 31 06:12:10 2014 UTC,"Kinda confused because your entire upper body looks smaller than a year ago, yet your legs have hugely increased. Are you eating right? What's your routine?"
Brogress,2c7tpg,summerswag,2,Thu Jul 31 07:19:28 2014 UTC,"I don't think that my upper body has gotten smaller. During my bulk I was at around 3000kcals a day with 200g protein, working out about 5 times a week.  This was my routine this year. Exercises were pretty much the same for last year, just a different split, so I feel like it's pretty much impossible that I lost any lean mass.  The visible increase in mass in my legs is due to the fact that I had been neglecting them until last year."
Brogress,2c7tpg,Sciar,1 point,Thu Jul 31 08:04:50 2014 UTC,"Your upper body has definitely not gotten smaller, looking at the 06/2014 pic your lats look way wider than before.

Brogress,2c7tpg,JeanJacquesGoldman,0,Thu Jul 31 13:26:12 2014 UTC,"3000kcals   If you're wondering why you didn't gain much size in 3 years, here's your problem. I usually cut around 2500 calories. 3k is maintenance for me and I'm sure you as well, since you have decent lean body mass. You should add a minimum of 500 calories to that for a few months and watch them numbers grow"
Brogress,2c7tpg,schutyser,1 point,Thu Jul 31 12:19:09 2014 UTC,"Sorry, 3000kcals was just a really shitty estimate, must have been more like 4000. You can see I gained around 10kgs during my bulk, so I don't think that eating too little could have been a problem.."

Brogress,2c7tpg,Bstpitch,2,Thu Jul 31 22:16:30 2014 UTC,"y naturally with perfect genetics maybe 6kg of muscle left to gain. of course nobody has perfect genetics (this is the 0.01% that are born ripped already can do whatever they want and still look fit. if they focus 100% on it with diet and training they would still need 3-5 years to go there from where op is now)  so yeah realistically putting him on normal genetics maybe a bit higher than average hed be able to gain at max 1-2kg of muscle over a year (if everything is done right) and in total maybe 2.5kg left... (we are speaking of being at the same low bodyfat, of course if hed go 140 kg he would have more than 2.5 kg muscle gainz......)  what naturals do at this lvl is train specific muscles so that they gain a little amount that makes them look so much bigger. It is a lot about creating an illusion. lightning, shades, bodyfat, water retention, msucle fullnes (how many carbs are at the moment stored and how much bloood is pumpin through them) how the body actually looks."

I didn't exercise and took ""abs in the kitchen"" to the extreme. I also followed the Paleo Diet very strictly  I had a change in mentality and switched to 5/3/1 BBB and ate everything. I dropped Myfitnesspal, but still followed Paleo about 60%. I hit the 1,000 lbs club and was 202 at my heaviest. Summer came along and I cut to get ready for vacation.  I took the second picture yesterday morning.   I now follow Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 Bodybuilding Routine and LOVE IT."
Brogress,2c2gvr,plindseylax,4,Tue Jul 29 19:07:49 2014 UTC,"I'm with you on the paleo in moderation strategy. Eating natural foods is great, but I found external sources are needed for an adequate carb intake for bulking up (without eating 6 sweet potatoes a day).  I had been using MFP very precisely until last week, when I chose to just drop it and eat big (but healthy). What were your observations about your progress once you dropped MFP?  Great work!"
Brogress,2c2gvr,plindseylax,2,Tue Jul 29 21:06:53 2014 UTC,"Thank you!  MFP was ruining my life, I would plan my nights beforehand and account for what I ate that day to make sure I wouldn't exceed my calories with ONLY vodka shots.   Since I used MFP for so long I am decent at eyeballing foods macro's and it has helped me learn about nutrition.   Since dropping MFP what I have noticed is if I want to bulk and eat ""clean"" I have to eat a very large amount of food. Don't be afraid to eat a lot of healthy food!"
Brogress,2c2gvr,plindseylax,1 point,Tue Jul 29 21:37:11 2014 UTC,"I was in the same boat. All summer I've been gone from 7AM to 7PM with lifting, then work, the football practice, so I packed & tracked everything the night before. Eyeballing is now a piece of cake for me. It's much easier to just grab healthy food now than it was to put exactly 200g of (whatever) in a bag.   I also found that writing down what you eat on your phone (but not how much) can help you stay accountable without counting or stressing over anything.   Do you still have GENERAL macros that you target, but don't obsess over?"

Brogress,2c08k0,ConcernedCivilian,8,Tue Jul 29 04:46:14 2014 UTC,"I really work to change my workout up between 3 different rep cycles every 2 weeks. What I mean by this is that for the first two weeks I'll really emphasize overtraining muscle groups: Chest and Tricep, Back and Bicep, Shoulders and Traps, and Legs. So for every excercise I do ill go 15-10-5-3-1 then back up 2-4-6-8-10. Basically always working to a one rep max. On the next week i'll do 5x5 and then following I'll take about 80%-90% of my max and rep as many times as I can then drop the weight 10 pounds each time all the way to about 50% of my max.  Chest and Tricep  Flat Bench  Incline Bench   Decline Bench  DB flys (flat and incline)  Cable Flys  Scull crusher  Tricep pull down  Overhead extensions  Back and Bicep  DL  Curl Bar super set with DB row  Straight Bar curl super set with seated row  5x10 Pull ups with different grips each time  Bar Bell row  21's  Hammer Curls  Shoulders and Traps  Overhead press  Barbell Traps  DB shoulder press  Arnold Press  Legs  Back Squat  Romanian DL  Leg Press  Calf Raise  End with Leg extension burnout i.e. 75% of max for AMRAP then drop weight 1 stud and continue process to 100 reps  Lifting stats  Bench press (1RM) --> 265  Squat (1RM) --> 325  Deadlift (1RM) --> 405  Basically what I have found success in is going to the gym and not thinking about the workout until I am full swing. I used to worry about it before hand and get negative thoughts about how I don't think I'll be able to lift this or that but when I'm in the process of actually doing it it becomes much easier.

If you're posting progress pics, you better have some thick skin unless your gains are stellar.  In terms of your request for constructive criticism, here you go: Clearly his progress is very poor after 16 months. Based on those pictures, I would have guessed 3 months progress or even less. No substantial muscle gain is visible, but body fat loss is pretty good I guess.   Not sure what his workout plan or diet is, but clearly he's doing something wrong. If he posted either of these it would be much more insightful."

Basically, I try to lean towards lean protein and vegetables. Potato chips are my weakness. I've been trying to avoid them lately because I could devour a huge bag in one sitting if I'm not careful.

Then I gained some knowledge and realized it was shitty brosplit with huge amount of cardio so it gets you results.   After that I started to concentrate on heavy compounds and went from SS to 531 to current push/pull. After the 12 week HC brosplit I started bulking to about 187 until last February, from which I cut to 171. That was in middle of May and after that just slow bulking to vikingmode.

Brogress,2brq4k,ArekDirithe,3,Sat Jul 26 10:35:00 2014 UTC,haha I was just saying because I had similar results in about a year from just doing my own split and I rarely see anything like that in SS transformations.

So Monday might be arms, Tuesday chest, Wednesday Back, etc.  Splits could also mean one day you do ""upper body"" exercises, then another day you do ""lower body"" exercises.

Should I power through the cut and lose remaining fat between here and abs, or just start bulking again and improving diet / routines?"
Brogress,2brxuf,Rijnsburg,7,Sat Jul 26 12:49:27 2014 UTC,"A period of time where you're not going to the gym doesn't at all seem like a good time to start cutting to me, actually.

I'm sure people can and do do this in a year or less but I work full time, enjoy going out on the piss, and started when I was 23 and in uni/college so didn't have the money to feed myself everything I needed. Within this 5 year brogress journey I have fluctuated in weight as I took breaks from the gym for travelling and due to injury. Where I am now is the happiest I have ever been, I can almost see my bottom abs (haven't made an appearance for sometime) and although I'm my heaviest, my waist is also at its smallest.   I will be posting my routine etc down below, I tend to change this every 6 weeks to keep my body guessing. It's similar to when I first started, but much more focused and tweaked to my personal body (but sure it would work for others).  I've said this before, but there is no wrong or right answer when it comes to body building, everyone reacts to it in a different way, I just took longer due to non lack of knowledge and dedication, time, and a love of all things alcohol related.

Brogress,2bn8nd,nephilis,4,Tue Aug 5 04:24:08 2014 UTC,"As requested my routine/diet (sorry for the metric system I live in the UK)  Day 1 Back and biceps  4 x reps bent over rows - 12reps x 50kgs - 10reps x 55kg - 8reps x 60kg - 6reps x 65kg    4 x reps of Lateral pull downs - 12 x 50kg, 10 x 55kg, 8 x 60kg, 6 x 65kg    3 x 10 chip ups - I use the 20kg assisted pad     3 x 12 cable rows (with large cable machine with pulley at very bottom) 15kg on each set, each arm.    3 x12 shrugs with dumbbells - 32kg on each hand each set.    Biceps curl using an EZ bar - 3 x 12-8 reps  Then same with standing dumbbell alternation curls as well as hammer curls - 3x12 @ 10kg on both.  Day 2 Chest and triceps  Flat bench dumbbell press 12x28kg, 10x30kg, 8x32kg, 6x34kg    Incline on the smith machine -  12x20kg(each side), 10x22.5kg, 8x25kg, 6x27.5kg    Decline barbell press (with Olympic bar and plate weights) - 12x20(each side), 10x22.5, 8x25, 6x27.5    3 x15 flat bench flies with 14kg Dumbells   Triceps- 3x as many dips as possible    3x 12 french press - 7.5kg plate's each side.  3x 12 cable extensions (about 20-30kg)     Day 3 Shoulders  With shoulders I tend to keep it lighter cause the muscles are individually much smaller so its better to drop the weight and control the exercise more.   Military press, barbell above the head - 12x30kg bar, 10x40kg, 8x45kg, 6x50kg  3 x 12 Cable Lateral raises with strap handle - 3.5kg each arm (Superset) 3 x 12 Cable front raises with a cable, one arm at a time - 3.5kg each arm    3 x 12 rear shoulder raises - 10kg dumbbell each arm.    3 x 12-8 dumbbell seated shoulder press 12x16 kg, 10x18 kg, 8x20kg       Day 4 Legs  Squats 12x50kg, 10x 60 kg, 8x70 kg, 6x80kg  3 x 12 Step Ups - 15kg dumbbells each hand  3 x 12 Reverse Step Ups - 15kg dumbbells each hand  3 x 12 Leg press - 80kg   (one important thing that has helped me recently is I time every rep/set break to exactly 1 minute, it helps keep intensity up and adds a kind of cardio element)  This is my current clean bulk diet:  Meal 1 – 30grams rolled oats, banana, Total Protein Shake (mixture of whey, milk, egg protein)  Meal 2 – Chicken/Fish/Beef, Broccoli/Spinach/Cabbage, Brown Rice/Sweet Potato/Pasta/Baked Potato  Meal 3 – Banana, Low fat yogurt, Wholemeal Chicken/Tuna/Beef wrap with salad  Pre workout Snack – Peanuts and Total Protein Shake with creatine  Workout  Post workout Snack – Blend 2 cups frozen Cherries/Strawberries/Blueberries/Banana, Total Protein Shake, 1pint Skimmed Milk  Meal 4 - Chicken/Fish/Beef, Broccoli/Spinach/Cabbage  (I have no carbs after 4pm, except a little from the frozen fruit)  This works out to (vague figures) 300-400 grams of protein 160 grams carbs 2600-3000 calories  This is a deficit for me as my daily requirement is around 3000-3500 for maintenance.  Hope this helps!"

When I struggled with it, I'd do what /u/imNOTaprofessional said, and blend things into high calorie shakes, some were easier to keep down than others but it was a good way of getting the calories in!

Brogress,2bleqo,friedpikmin,5,Thu Jul 24 15:49:12 2014 UTC,Can you post the routine? Is it the same when you're both bulking and cutting?
Brogress,2bleqo,KingBanz,8,Thu Jul 24 18:07:37 2014 UTC,"Sure this is a typical day. Some days I throw in extra sets if I'm feeling great, other days I'll drop a couple if I'm dragging ass.   Push:  4 sets flat bench 4 sets incline bench 4 sets dumbbell shoulder press 3 sets rear delt flies 3 sets lateral raises 3 sets skulls crushers 3 sets rope tricep extensions  I'll sub flat/incline bench for dumbells property every 3rd cycle or so. Just because I feel it gives my joints a break.   Legs  5-8 sets squats 3 sets straight leg deadlifts 3 sets weighted walking lunges 3 sets leg extensions  I really need to up my leg game I think  Pull day  4 working sets of deadlifts (every other pull day) 3 sets bent over barbell rows 3 sets bent over barbell rows (underhand grip) 5 sets lat pull down  3 sets standing lat push downs Pull ups to failure 3 sets barbell curls (by this time my biceps are already pretty fried) 3 sets incline dumbbell curls  Honestly I've never done a real bulk as I was fat my whole life.

I was also doing pull-ups on the same days that I did those push-ups.   Once I could do 25 push-ups with each hand, I moved on to handstand push-ups. I did them against the wall until I could do two free standing handstand push-ups.   That was about a week ago that I could finally do it, so I've recently moved into planche exercises. I do about 3 sets of 5 straddle planche push-ups every other day along with the pull-ups that I have not stopped doing the entire time.   For legs, I just do one legged squats every day that I'm not doing the push-ups and pull-ups, and it's been working pretty well because, although you can't see it, my thighs have gotten very defined and a lot stronger.   For abs, I just hang from the pull-up bar and raise my legs up straight and to the sides for 10 sets of 10, plus plan hung puts a lot of stress on the abs.   i hope to reach a full planche soon, but I need to get my shoulders a bit stronger for that.

I have worked with a coach for a while now and he says if you're gonna do it, go for the real thing. The bills are snake-oil, voodoo bullshit.  I didn't believe him tried it anyway. Literally did NOTHING.   Your test will naturally raise with a good diet, exercise, low beer/alcohol intake, and weirdly enough taking tons of dumps (flushes estrogen).   If you want to kick if off, honestly go for the real thing. Check out r/steroids for help. Tons of good, judgement free information.  Finally get your blood-work done, if it's super low your doctor can suggest things to make it better. I got mine done after seeing no difference from taking 'natural testosterone enhancement' and turns out I was really low. Got some good advice from a real doctor and have seen some MAJOR differences.  But again, i'm one dude, who did it one way; and it's really up to your body.

Brogress,2bg50a,Zephyr321,3,Wed Jul 23 05:56:32 2014 UTC,"Dude, go someplace crowded and look around you.  Almost none of the men you'll see can bench their own bodyweight.  Among guys who lift regularly, you are an intermediate lifter.  And your body looks completely different than it did when you started.  That after only a couple months of lifting?  That is great progress!    Pat yourself on the back, bro.  But don't give yourself a shoulder impingment while doing it.  That'll fuck up your progress.  Excellent job so far!"
Brogress,2bg50a,spacetug,1 point,Wed Jul 23 10:27:51 2014 UTC,Thank you so much!  I have been lifting for 11 months but I never was as serious about it until early 2014.

Brogress,2bfzg5,mat1101,4,Wed Jul 23 01:50:34 2014 UTC,"probably because it's a 1 month progress pic. I mean great job and all, but it's getting kinda annoying when people only show their progress after a month to 6 months. People on this sub want to see major changes like after 1.5 years or 2 years, so thats probably why"

Brogress,2bf0cg,OKedition,24,Tue Jul 22 18:17:49 2014 UTC,Not sure I'm buying what you're selling.  That transformation doesn't look anything like 2 months of eating a surplus of 500 cals a day.  You lost a LOT of fat while gaining over 10 pounds of muscle in two months?  Nah.
Brogress,2bf0cg,jermikemike,1 point,Tue Jul 22 21:50:49 2014 UTC,"Those pictures are not from two months ago, I didn't really take any then, so you are kinda right.   They are from when I was doing a lot of opiates and amphetamines and not eating shit. I could have weighed less than 130 then but I was scared to step on a scale.   Since I've got off drugs, started playing soccer again, and messed around over the winter with p90x I had a better starting base than those pictures show."
Brogress,2bf0cg,jermikemike,3,Tue Jul 22 22:00:20 2014 UTC,"That makes sense for the pictures.  I'm still curious about your overall 2 months transformation though.  Basically, you're current pictures look like you just finished a pretty thorough cut.  Your body fat % is very low, probably near the single digits, in those pictures.     I guess you're playing/practicing a shit ton of soccer.   You're on the right track.  Once you get in a gym with some bars and bigger kettles/dumb bells I'd suggest eating a little more each day to give your body some more fuel for those muscles.  Good work."
Brogress,2bf0cg,manboobs123,2,Wed Jul 23 05:07:39 2014 UTC,The scale I use put me at 11 percent 2 months ago when I started working out again. Today it says 15 percent. I hear those scales aren't very accurate but I can definitely tell I've put on some fat along with the muscle.  When I put on a few pounds over the winter I could definitely see my face/cheeks getting fatter but this time that isn't really happening.

Brogress,2bf0cg,Sp33d0J03,1 point,Tue Jul 22 20:36:59 2014 UTC,"Routine is probably less structured than it should be but I mostly follow the Steve cotter extreme kettlebell DVDs.  For the first month I was probably doing 4-5 days of upper body focus and only 1 of legs, but after the first month I switched to 3-4 of upper and 2 leg days. I also have a soccer game once a week.   I start with a couple minute warm up of various swings and snatched to get blood flowing and then I go into the main course.   It's usually 7-8 exercises that I cycle through 3 or 4 times depending on how much energy I have. I aim for the 8-15 rep range for each and by the end of 1 cycle I'm fucking gassed and covered in sweat. Some exercises use two bells at once, some only use one.   I'm all it takes about an hour and after I'm pretty tired.  I also do a lot of different variations of push-ups and pull-ups depending on what else I'm working out that day. And I mean a lot.   I'm a sprinter on the soccer field so I'm not really going for bulk. The numbers I'm more concerned about are my 40 time and vertical leap, more than how much I can squat."

Brogress,2bf0cg,the_moist_maker_,1 point,Wed Jul 23 13:01:38 2014 UTC,"I did work out half assedly for a few months this winter doing the strength p90x videos and then got the kettlebells for Christmas. I couldn't do a single two handed swing when I got them, now I can rep out 12 and feel like a beast.   I didn't really have my diet down either, I just ate more than normal, and I was able to gain a few pounds. Then for some reason I gave it up and didn't lift a thing from March to end of May.   Then I got a hot date and realized I needed to get my ass back working out. But I do think fucking around in the winter gave me a small base to quickly build back up to.   Now I've gotten more into the fitness subs, followed the Steve Cotter video exercises more closely and started eating a lot of chicken and rice. Seeing results though really gives you the most motivation."

Brogress,2bcdd1,Triguy2014,8,Mon Jul 21 23:25:27 2014 UTC,"Point of this Update from: This Original Post is to see if I am gaining too much fat/weight too fast??  Ended my cut end of May and began bulk.  Is gaining almost 20 lbs in 8 weeks too much?  I know the most lean muscle amount gained per week possible is approx .5 lb.  This is my first bulk ever, so I'm pretty new to this.  Program:  Loosely following SL 5x5 with accessory work.  Working out 6 days/week.  Progress [May 23 - Jul 21] (all working weight):   Bench 5x5: 155 -> 210 Dead 1x5:   200 -> 340 Squat 5x5:  200 -> 285 OHP:  Tweaked my shoulder so I haven't been lifting consistently.   Diet: Breakfast:    5 whole eggs 1 cup greek yogurt 1 cup fruit (blueberries or strawberries) 5 pieces of sliced turkey   Lunch:   2 cans of tuna or salmon salad + dressing handful of almonds   Snack:   4 eggs Two pieces of toast with 4 tablespoons of almond butter   Dinner:   10 oz meat salad   Post workout:   2 scoop ON Whey   Supplements:   Kre-alkylen x3 per day BCAA x3 per day Fish Oil x3 per day   Thanks!"
Brogress,2bcdd1,PhatsCockstrangla,3,Mon Jul 21 23:34:52 2014 UTC,"You looked pretty awesome after your cut, but you may want to consider slowing down on your bulk to around .5-1 lb/week.  As you mentioned, you can only gain about .5 lb/week of lean muscle as a natural and any additional calories past a certain point will just be stored as fat.  You'll end up having to cut for much longer after your bulk, which makes it more difficult to preserve your strength and screws up your metabolism.  By slow bulking, you'll gain minimal fat and will look good year round.  With regards to your diet, it looks like you're getting plenty of protein and fats, but very minimal carbs.  You may want to consider upping your carb intake if your mood or energy levels are getting affected."
Brogress,2bcdd1,PhatsCockstrangla,1 point,Tue Jul 22 20:43:25 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response. All of that makes sense. Like I mentioned earlier, this is my first time lifting consistently and bulking, so I've only been used to cutting/maintaining for my previous sport (triathlon).   I'm just worried that if I cut calories too close to my maintenance I'll start stalling out on strength gains - as I've been happy with a consistent increase in all of my lifts this far."
Brogress,2bcdd1,jchn930,1 point,Wed Jul 23 00:26:47 2014 UTC,"You've made some amazing progress so far. However, your strength gains will eventually slow down regardless of how much you're eating. You can't keep adding weight to the bar every week forever.  When you're new to lifting, you can even gain some strength while cutting.  Once you're eating at a sufficient level, eating beyond that won't increase your strength gains, only your fat. Try tapering your calories back slowly to where you're gaining 1 lb/wk and see how you respond."

Brogress,2b37ks,ShupUt,3,Fri Jul 18 23:47:49 2014 UTC,"A good amount of fish, chicken, lots of greens, very low sodium, no excessive carbs, and low fat/sugar. Pretty much lean meats and greens."
Brogress,2b37ks,Armandorene,3,Fri Jul 18 23:59:59 2014 UTC,Can you elaborate?  Like give me an example of your day.  I don't know what a diet at roughly 2700 calories with low carbs and fat looks like.  Are you literally eating 15 chicken breasts a day?
Brogress,2b37ks,Hiant,2,Sat Jul 19 03:44:55 2014 UTC,"Breakfast: Oats, Egg Whites, Mass gainer, Kashi Go Lean cereal, Water Lunch: Chicken Breast/Tuna/Salmon/Trout, mixed vegetables, Mass gainer, Juice Dinner: Tuna/Salmon/Trout/Chicken Breast, more vegetables, Mass gainer*, Juice  Now my diet was and is very repetitive and boring, and to be honest I was limited to a budget so I couldn't go harder on my diet but above is a basic version of it.  My portions are decently sized and it took my sometimes more than an hour to eat all of this when I was starting out, I had little appetite and would get full easy so I just sat down at the table and focused on finishing everything, I tried to make sure I was full at all times except before the gym.   I only listed 3 meals here but those were the big 3, I would eat in between as well.   My mass gainer was: Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass + whole milk + 2-3 Bananas + 1 tbsp Honey  The mass gainer had the most fat/carbs but it really helped put on size fast, and i'm well aware I had an excess of protein, drinking a good amount of water was also key.  Hope that helps."
Brogress,2b37ks,FunnOnABunn,3,Sat Jul 19 03:55:07 2014 UTC,"That does help.  It makes a lot more sense now.  Don't take this the wrong way, but when I read ""no excessive carbs"" I don't envision taking mass gainer 3 times a day, which is literally about 750g of carbs.    Not knocking you for that, because your progress speaks for itself and I am going to look into that mass gainer myself because I have a hard time getting enough calories with a ""cleaner"" diet.

Brogress,2b2uyx,Jewdontknow,1 point,Sat Jul 19 02:58:47 2014 UTC,"I did fasted lifting and cardio at least 5 days a week. For weights I had a basic split focusing on hypertrophy from bodybuilding.com that focuses on doing at least 30-40 total reps for each exercise. For this program, you should only be able to hit 10 reps with the first set of each exercise, then take a 30 sec break, then do as many reps until failure (should be around 5 this time), take a 30 sec break, push as many reps as possible, and continue till you reach at least 30 total reps. So usually for bench, my reps for each set would look something like this: 10,5,5,4,3,3 (30 total). More info here.    Day 1/Chest,front delts,triceps: Bench press, incline bench press, rope pressdowns, overhead dumbbell extensions, dumbbell side laterals Day 2/Upper back,rear-delts,biceps:Chin-ups, pull-ups, chest-supported rows (or seated rows), rear delt flyes, preacher curls. Day 3/Legs,lower back:Romanian deadlifts, front squats, leg curls, leg extensions, standing calf raises, seated calf raises Day 4: Repeat Day 1 Day 5: Repeat Day 2 Day 6: Repeat Day 3 Day 7:Rest (usually did cardio or extra ab work if I went to the gym) I also tried to do at least one form of weighted ab exercise at least once every other day. I'll probably switch to a different routine now that I'll be slow bulking however.  For cardio I would try to burn at least 300-400 cal a day, either by running on the treadmill or hitting the elliptical at heavy resistance. I didn't eat the calories burned from cardio back so that probably what helped me lose a steady 2lb a week."

Brogress,2arnjx,Bubba143,2,Wed Jul 16 02:27:06 2014 UTC,Fascinating. Do you know what the science is behind the intermittent fasting and the not eating eating for 6 hours after waking up? Because I've been accidentally doing this for the past 3 weeks and oddly enough I feel a tremendous difference.

Brogress,2assli,BrbPoolOnFire,-1,Wed Jul 16 04:35:36 2014 UTC,"Nope! I find that a lot of back workouts involve certain shoulder muscles. I'm sure I'll eventually work in some specific shoulder workouts, but for now I'm seeing good progress as is."

Brogress,2aqt96,notathrowawayimshy,8,Tue Jul 15 07:15:18 2014 UTC,You're definitely a lot closer to a v taper. But a thousand calories a day will not help you gain any muscle
Brogress,2aqt96,ReMaine,1 point,Tue Jul 15 10:08:05 2014 UTC,What is a v taper? So what should my target caloric intake be if I want to lose weight and gain muscle?
Brogress,2aqt96,ReMaine,1 point,Tue Jul 15 10:11:09 2014 UTC,Its a V shaped body. You can't lose weight and gain muscle. You do one or the other. Read the FAQ on /r/fitness
Brogress,2aqt96,MichiganFitness,2,Tue Jul 15 10:13:49 2014 UTC,"You can't lose weight and gain muscle.    Isn't that contrary to the first FAQ under the /r/fitness sidebar? The ability to lose weight and gain muscle diminishes as you get closer to a lean, muscular physique. This being especially true for new athletes."
Brogress,2aqt96,ridermiv,1 point,Wed Jul 16 06:15:11 2014 UTC,I think you mean lose fat and gain muscle. Which I believe is still technically not losing weight.
Brogress,2aqt96,ReMaine,1 point,Thu Aug 14 21:16:09 2014 UTC,Ok so do you suggest I cut now or keep my weight even and then cut after a few months? I have a respectable amount of fat still all around my body.
Brogress,2aqt96,ReMaine,1 point,Tue Jul 15 10:19:49 2014 UTC,It's really depends all on what you want to do. If you want to be lean cut but not at 1000 calories or you'll loss muscle mass. Use this to see how much calories you should be getting http://iifym.com/iifym-calculator/.
Brogress,2aqt96,Bushybushings,1 point,Tue Jul 15 10:26:23 2014 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/3B4K56k.png  so at around 2000 calories a day I can lose a bit of fat and gain muscle? sounds good to me.
Brogress,2aqt96,hr_shovenstuff,1 point,Tue Jul 15 10:34:06 2014 UTC,uhh no you'll loss fat and most likely retain muscle
Brogress,2aqt96,Grilled_Chicken,1 point,Tue Jul 15 10:37:53 2014 UTC,"You cannot gain muscle while losing fat, you need a caloric excess to build muscle, and a caloric deficit to lose fat. You can't do both."
Brogress,2aqt96,Grilled_Chicken,3,Sat Jul 19 03:54:18 2014 UTC,"Bulk. Cutting now would be stupid. You can probably count on a solid year bulk before thinking of cutting.   You need muscle to justify a cut. Otherwise you're just thin and scrawny, not a great look. Develop your muscle then show it off."
Brogress,2ansv8,Akumetsu33,16,Mon Jul 14 12:18:42 2014 UTC,"Diet, calories consumed, macros, routines, etc."
Brogress,2ansv8,Milkster,8,Mon Jul 14 13:23:29 2014 UTC,"I never really was a specific details person when it comes to macros/calories(yet).  Diet=  Breakfast: 2 whole eggs with around 10 egg whites, 3 bananas, a cup of oatmeal, whey protein with peanut butter.   Lunch: a cup of brown rice mixed with various vegs(broccoli, carrots, spinach, peas, green beans) and 8oz salmon or filet mignon.  Afternoon lunch: pasta with around 8oz chicken breast and mixed vegs. Whey protein mixed with 2 bananas.  Dinner: Rice or pasta with ground beef or salmon and mixed vegs. Around 10oz sweet/baked potato.  Evening meal:Beans and 3 chicken thighs with a bowl of asparagus and broccoli(around 2 cups) and whey protein.   The meat/fish and rice/pasta can be switched around the meals randomly.  I'd guess around 5,000 to 6,000 calories depending on how I feel. I jog every day and I play basketball almost daily for at least two hours and volleyball at least three times a week so it's a ton of cardio which allows me to consume a lot of calories(and pasta, my favorite) without really worrying about body fat.  Routine  Mondays, wednesdays, saturdays: biceps, chest, lats.  Tuesdays, fridays: back, triceps, shoulders, traps, legs.  Thursdays: Whatever I feel like.  Sunday=rest.  Every 2nd day no matter what day, I work on my core/abs  I don't know my body fat and I don't exactly keep track of my lifting stats. IIRC, bench press=around 160kg?, DL=190kg. As for squats, I've never done a max squat, I'm too scared to try it cause of my knees(had a lot of knee injuries). Always had a fear my knees would give out/dislocate. Regular squats is 180kg I think.   Sorry I couldn't give more specific details. But I would love to hear any advice and suggestions you guys have. Many of you have much more experience and knowledge about bodybuilding than me. I'm always tinkering and trying to improve my diet and routine."
Brogress,2ansv8,ssosina,2,Mon Jul 14 15:17:14 2014 UTC,Awesome! so you were hitting muscle groups at least twice a week?
Brogress,2ansv8,ssosina,1 point,Mon Jul 14 16:40:12 2014 UTC,"Yeah but sometimes if a muscle group still feels sore, I'd skip that one and add it to the next day's workout or save it for thursday, the whatever-you-feel-like workout so I'd still hit my quota per week."
Brogress,2ansv8,twinhed,2,Mon Jul 14 17:42:31 2014 UTC,"just out of interest, did you ever workout to failure?"
Brogress,2ansv8,twinhed,2,Mon Jul 14 21:37:30 2014 UTC,"Yeah. I like doing working out to failure mostly at the end of the work out because if I do it early in the workout, it can affect my other exercises."
Brogress,2ansv8,twinhed,1 point,Tue Jul 15 01:05:34 2014 UTC,Do you recommend beginners hit each muscle group twice a week?
Brogress,2ansv8,svesrujm,2,Mon Jul 14 18:08:11 2014 UTC,"It varies with each person, but IMO, no. I think it's better to learn to crawl first before walking, if that makes sense.  When I started out, I tried doing that. I ended up getting burnt out, lose motivation and pulled muscles I never knew I had. My body wasn't used to the workload and I needed more time to recover back then than now. Start with once a week, and work your way up."
Brogress,2ansv8,svesrujm,1 point,Mon Jul 14 18:49:25 2014 UTC,I'm currently on a 4 day split but during my off days I'm craving the gym and I really want to continue exercising but from what I read people recommend only doing one muscle group per week.
Brogress,2ansv8,Darksider123,1 point,Mon Jul 14 19:53:33 2014 UTC,"I know the feeling of craving the gym haha. Like I said it varies with each person. Listen to your body and decide if you should hit the gym or not. If you're feeling good, go for it! There's always something to work out. Maybe light cardio, core work, calf raises(for me calves can be worked more often than the average muscle group), stuff like that."
Brogress,2ansv8,ChequeBook,2,Mon Jul 14 21:04:04 2014 UTC,"You're right about that, I'm going to move core and calves to twice a week."

You have to be consistent with eating a lot and rest to let your arms grow. I learned it the hard way. Back then, I thought working the arms out constantly would make it grow. I was wrong. Around 5,000-6,000 calories, I think."

Brogress,2ad3zl,SimaSi,2,Sat Jul 12 00:09:43 2014 UTC,I have seen good results from PHAT. I did starting strength in the past and never liked it since all I cared about was looking good and sculpting my body. So I switched to PHAT about three months ago and never looked back. For the first three weeks I cut out two-three exercises from each day since people suggested to do that because of all the volume. My lifts were very low when I started (I was a beginner) but I got 8 hours of sleep each night and enough calories to recover. My DB bench press went from 30lbs to 60 lbs. Here are some pictures.  Excuse the first picture I uploaded them really quick so you can see. I know it's corny but it is my iphone motivational wallpaper. I uploaded two other pictures since the first before picture is blurry and the after picture has special shadow/lighting. I could had seen better results if I ate more.  http://imgur.com/a/AghS7  Many people say to start off with SS or ICF 5x5 but I found those to be boring and I wanted to be in the gym more. I know myself and I knew that I won't stick to a workout routine if it's boring so I switched to PHAT. I switch up some of the exercises every now and then to keep it fresh.
Brogress,2ad3zl,closerthanassumed,3,Sat Jul 12 00:34:30 2014 UTC,I'm getting into lifting and these pictures inspire me. Great results. Just one question I haven't found an answer to yet - do you basically eat the same thing every day?
Brogress,2ad3zl,closerthanassumed,3,Fri Jul 11 02:06:04 2014 UTC,Most of the time yes. I'm less strict when I'm bulking. When I'm cutting I rarely cheat on my diet. I seldom change the spices I put on my meal when I get bored of the taste haha.

Brogress,2a6m50,explosivefajitas,60,Tue Jul 8 22:01:43 2014 UTC,"Not natty, have two cycles. currently (picture in stringer with pump) on a low dose cruise before a bulk into contest prep. I bulk at around 3,600 calories. I find that in this area with at least 250 grams of protein and mostly complex carbs I can grow while staying somewhat maintaining lean-ness. I keep some cardio around to stay athletic and help with conditioning. When cutting I carb cycle and keep my fats/proteins constant. Carbs go 175-125-100 and then a refeed day where I put protein down to 1G per lean mass and eat kind of whatever I want. I eat mostly clean on cuts to help restrict my macros/calories. I am a dietetics student so i do subscribe to clean eating in some ways, but I do enjoy the occasional (sometimes daily) pre workout pop tarts So far I have no cut for more than 6 weeks. Being naturally lean, I lower the calories, up the cardio, and sometimes add in some ephedrine or low dose clen (I have not been convinced I've found legit clen though). I deadlift 455 for 5, Squat 405 for 2-5 right now (switched to front squats to help quad development and rep 315 on that) and I bench 315 for two. I like to train 3-5 reps on big compounds at the beginning of my workouts, and then move into hammer strength/cable/dumbell movements at an 9-12 and sometimes 12-16 rep ranges. I change things up often and try to keep it interesting. I've been lifting for quite a while but only got actually serious and cleaned up my life for the last 3 years. I fell off for about 3-4 months during those 3 years but I've made a commitment to this now."

Brogress,2a6m50,MrM3r,13,Wed Jul 9 03:35:08 2014 UTC,"To be fair the only thing keeping me from creating a youtube channel would be this barrier. I'm the mod of a sub specifically dedicated to sharing sources of drugs for bodybuilding, it would be wrong to lie about this. I am not always this honest with everyone. Impressionable young children, newbies at the gym, women I don't know well, and doctors are never told the truth about my use. All for perfectly fine reasons I believe."
Brogress,2a6m50,throwawayaccount__,4,Wed Jul 9 03:37:41 2014 UTC,"Why wouldn't you want to create a youtube channel? I can think of several channels from guys on gear who admit to it and talk about it (although never in a lot of detail).   And I totally agree that gear use isn't something you should talk about with most people, I just think that on this particular sub it's important that people be honest about it in order to temper people's expectations."
Brogress,2a6m50,chiniwini,5,Wed Jul 9 03:41:44 2014 UTC,"The stigma of me using anabolics is what bothers me. I know very well that I put in the work day in and day out, and that while I tailor my training and nutrition to the drugs I use, most people would not understand nor accept that. I know how the world/internet views steroid usage and my channel would probably not do very well thus. Who do you know on youtube that does, other than jerry ward and jason blaha?"
Brogress,2a6m50,fannymcslap,3,Wed Jul 9 03:44:16 2014 UTC,"There's definitely a very negative stigma associated with it in society, but I think among people who are very serious about fitness its widely accepted, even among people who choose to stay natural. If you're well educated enough, it becomes clear that it isn't ""cheating"" and it can be safe.  Jerry Ward and Jason Blaha are actually the only ones I can think of. I guess you're right; it isn't that common."

There are many cross reactions that can take place with other meds or conditions that you could get (hoping not of course). I just wouldn't want you to get seriously ill and lose any progress. Doctors are bound by patient confidentially and will be there to look out for you.
Brogress,2a6m50,greedo_posted_first,3,Wed Jul 9 17:05:00 2014 UTC,"This is the one thing that I would make an exception for. I generally am a very healthy person (take many preventative health supps, rarely get sick, eat very well, I wrote in the post I'm a dietetics student) so I rarely see my doctor other than for small illnesses or injuries. If I ever needed something hormonal I would definitely let them know. I don't take T3, DNP, or any anti-stress or depressants that would have an issue but I agree with you on that."
Brogress,2a6m50,sloppychris,5,Wed Jul 9 18:12:43 2014 UTC,"I just wanted to say: even if you are not natty, I think that progress is perfectly achievable in 4 years naturally. So everybody, don't get discouraged.  And as others have said, thank you for the honesty.  Edit: from your comment I understand than, for the same muscle (on the same workout), you start with a power lifting exercise and then move to more traditionally bodybuilding sets. Is this correct? Have you tried other approaches, and how did they work?"
Brogress,2a6m50,sterberks,3,Wed Jul 9 15:58:21 2014 UTC,"I think if I had started where I was and slowly lean bulked over that course, yes I could have reached this with 100% accuracy day ina nd day out. I don't have many pictures during my last cycle when I ran tren but I looked incredible I was a lean 235 and had that 3D, vascular, full look that only anabolics can give. But you are right. with everything totally in check I could have reached this  And yes, I start most body parts with the compound for that muscle (chest-bench, shoulders-military press, back-row, etc) and work around 3-5 reps. on the last set I will drop set and bang out 8-12 reps to failure and really get a good squeeze in. from there I move to more bodybuilding rep ranges. I have done wendler, steve cook's big man on campus, shortcut to size, and Doggcrap. I feel this really works well for me along with my current spliut where I do everything once a week except legs and arms, I hit twice. I don't train abs often, maybe every other week heavy and hard."

Obviously OP can decide what he wants to do."

Brogress,2a4z2j,jianthekorean,0,Wed Jul 9 12:27:47 2014 UTC,"I'm constantly wondering the same thing.  Thing is, the body can only use a certain number of calories to build muscle, and past that point, the excess is stored as fat.  The general wisdom is that this number is 500 calories above your maintenance level, and correspondingly cutting is 500 calories below.  I would take an honest look at your body now and ask of the pounds you gained, how many of them were muscle, and how many were fat.  I'd get rid of the fat while consistently and strenuously working out.  You'll keep most of the muscle and look much better.  Then bulk again, cleanly next time.  If you eat way too much, you're only creating the necessity for a cut in the future, which will again risk the gains you've made.  Don't let your weight go up and down, up and down, not really building concrete gains in the process.  Just my two cents."
Brogress,2a4z2j,djg08,0,Wed Jul 9 14:00:02 2014 UTC,"with all due respect, if you're going to hound PohFahVoh for being too fat then advising 'general wisdom' of arbitrary figures just isn't going to get the right results on a day to day basis - the best way of working this out is finding maintenance cals required (Mifflin St-Jeor equation)....working out your daily activity levels (office job, etc sedentary so x1.2 and a labourer might have to adjust by up to 1.75x etc etc all found via google search...) then adjusting via body type (endo, ecto, meso etc - google search a test)   eg. I'm a mesomorph and only require 20% of kcals in fats for a lean bulk. As fats have 9x/g calorie density then I have to hit 66g of fats/day. Protein & Carbs have 4x/g density & so using 2.75g/kg target protein I then fill up the rest of my daily macro goals with Carbs.  Gone off on a slight tangent there but the bottom line is, aesthetic goals are personal goals, he's gained 28 lbs on a dirty bulk...give the lad some credit"

Brogress,2a3u65,dsesin,5,Tue Jul 8 02:03:37 2014 UTC,"I started clean bulking and went from 170lbs to 190 lbs in about 3 months. During that time I did not count my macros, but I ate tons of carbs, protein, fat. Basically everything and anything I could eat. My breakfast would consist of 5 eggs, 2 sausages, and a bowl of oatmeal. As a second meal I would normally eat subway foot longs or chipotle burritos. For lunch I ate large amounts of steak or chicken as well as mountains of rice and veggies. For my fourth meal of the day, I would make myself ""homemade bulkshakes"" they were made of 2 scoops of oatmeal, one scoop of protein, a banana, peanut butter, and milk. For dinner I would eat basically the same thing I ate for lunch. I did this for 3 months straight, and I think what made me gain the most weight was the bulk shakes. When I took the second picture and weighed myself I got scared I was going to get too fat, my goal was to get to 200lbs but I was afraid. I was growing so fast that I got a stretch mark under my armpit. When it was time to cut, I got under a strict keto diet, I would not consume more than 40-50g of carbohydrates per day. I kept my protein and fat intake relatively high. Also I combined this with some cardio, no more than 15 minutes a day of jumping rope. I've been losing fat pretty fast, and I'm trying to get to 10% bodyfat.   TL;DR Bulked too fast/became afraid/cut really fast"

I think most of the weight gained went to my back, biceps, and legs. I gained a little bit of chest, but it's always been a lagging area of mine.

Brogress,2a2iax,willtoprepare,2,Mon Jul 7 18:22:56 2014 UTC,"Training Routine:    Never performed any cardio over this time period. Workout was pretty simple. Monday - Chest ; Tuesday - Back ; Wednesday - Arms ; Thursday - Shoulders ; Friday - Legs. Saturday and Sunday rest.  Lifted heavy; basically would lift the maximum weight possible to six reps of good form. Once I could move up to 10 reps in any one set of that weight, I'd move up in weight and drop back down to six reps. Routine was something like:    Chest 3 sets incline dumbell press 3 sets flat dumbell press 3 sets incline dumbell flys 3 sets cable crossovers  Back 3 sets Deadlift 3 sets lat pulldowns 3 sets one-arm dumbell row 3 sets seated cable row 3 sets bent-over barbell row  Arms 3 sets alternating dumbell curls 3 sets hammer curls 3 sets dumbell preacher curls 3 sets rope pushdown 3 sets overhead triceps extension 3 sets French Press  Shoulders 3 sets military press 3 sets shoulder shrugs 3 sets upright rows 3 sets shoulder flys 3 sets front raises  Legs 3 sets squats/3 sets leg press 3 sets standing calf raises 3 sets leg extensions  Diet I ate pretty clean. Usually about half-dozen eggs, some kind of meat (bacon/sausage/ham), and oatmeal in the morning. A protein shake mid-morning. Two chicken breasts on spinach with some olive oil and vinegar for lunch. Footlong tuna sub with cheese for dinner. Protein shake at night.    I'm going to make another push again, which is why I'm showing this now. This was a couple of years ago. I'm weighing in at 184 right now, and am going to try to get to about 200 in 2 months or so. I'm basically following Jay Cutler's 8 week mass gaining workout and eating 2918 calories a day, 290 protein, 300 carb, 68 fat.   I hope to update here again around the first of September with another post and will tell you how it goes. If you have any questions, feel free to ask."

Brogress,29ts3u,haterman,3,Sat Jul 5 08:49:50 2014 UTC,Hey great job! Just one question. I look like your starting photo and I was wondering if you ate at a calorie deficit or surplus? I recently lost a lot of weight and I'm scared of putting it back on. But at the same time I don't want to waste my time by lifting without eating enough.
Brogress,29ts3u,Mahazzel,6,Fri Jul 4 22:44:43 2014 UTC,"Definitely a deficit! Cutting is all about eating less, than you burn. It's a simple input/output calculation. I started eating clean and counted my calories in the beginning (like for 2 weeks straight). My goal was 1700 cals per day. I got a good feeling of which products had good macros and wich had bad macros. I'm also trying to eat as little carbs as possible (low carb diet). But fuck that shit on weekends! No one can take away a lovely breakfast with croissants and bread from me^"

Brogress,29ts3u,bro69,2,Fri Jul 4 15:36:39 2014 UTC,So I realize this is a dumb question but by 5x5's that is 5 sets of 5 reps right? I look a lot like you did in the second picture. I've been at it for about two months. I've lost a lot of weight before from purely cardio so I can't understand how it didn't do anything for you. Great job by the way. I can't wait until I can post similar results.
Brogress,29ts3u,Koalamanx,2,Fri Jul 4 21:05:29 2014 UTC,Its nice to see ups and down. People think a good body is just some eating clean and working out. They are wrong. To look good you have to live good.
Brogress,29ts3u,bro69,2,Fri Jul 4 21:49:47 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I never saw a person getting fat/unhealthy again on these fitting subreddits. So i hope it's a small inspiration for people who are in the same situation like I've been. GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER, EAT CLEAN AND LIFT STRONG!"

Excel will be your friend. If you can't squat due to spinal issues there are myriad ways to work legs that are not as spine intensive, same for deadlifts.   Just, don't quit. It's been 5 years for me now and I don't have access to my progress pics right now but I will give them along with my Xray...   While good genes and a body that's built right helps, what really gets this shit done is SPIRIT, DRIVE, AND DETERMINATION. Just don't quit and failure will never be a reality."

Didn't even know, just went in to the doc with some back pain and many many appts later I learned I have a leg length discrepancy. I can't run without pain, can't squat, etc etc. The curve has offset my hips and caused a problem in my SI joint.  Do you experience any pain from the scoliosis? How do you deal with it?

Brogress,29npub,vespaz,1 point,Sun Jul 13 17:54:27 2014 UTC,"I'm definitely natural, I don't know the first thing about steroids and I don't have any desire to ever use them because my goal is to be lean and muscular, not huge.   Routine - Basically:  Day 1: (Push) - Shoulders. Overhead press, lateral raises, overhead dumbbell press.  Day 2: (Pull) - Biceps and back. Dumbbell curls, pendlay rows, seated row, slow pull-ups, muscle ups.  Day 3: (Push) - Chest and Triceps. Dumbbell chest flys, Dumbbell press, dlow pushups, tricep extension (cable), dips  Day 4: (Push and Pull) Legs. Squats and Deadlifts.  Rest day  Day 5: Run 4.5 miles with 3 sets of dips, 3 sets of pull ups and 3 sets of muscle ups along the way (the park has lots of bars).  Rest day  I always workout at 4:30 in the morning just because I hate crowds and it works for my schedule. As far as diet, I have a high calorie protein shake for breakfast since I'm starving after the gym. Chicken breast, brown rice and broccoli for lunch, then whatever for dinner as long as its not too full of carbs or fried food. I drink a gallon of water a day, no soda, and only drink on the weekends (more than I should).  I stopped worrying about how heavy the weights are: I only focus on strict, good form and progress in weight very slowly, if at all. I'm not trying to get huge or deadlift 500 pounds. I just want to be the strongest version of myself and look good while I'm at it."
Brogress,29npub,spankmyalpaca,2,Sun Jul 13 20:37:00 2014 UTC,our philosophies mesh well.    you look great and my wife agrees with me to the point where i had to say 'give me the fucking computer back'.    2 questions.  1) do you take 2 rest days? i only see up to day 5 here.  2) are you pretty strict with diet other than drinking and 'whatever' for dinner? i'm a serial grazer.   thanks for the help.
Brogress,29npub,squatheavyeatbig,1 point,Mon Jul 14 01:29:45 2014 UTC,"Haha, thanks man.   Yes I take two rest days. 4 days on, 1 rest day, run/prison workout day, rest day, repeat.  My diet is pretty boring, but I try to think of food as necessary fuel that doesn't always have to be jam packed with variety and flavor - though I do enjoy that on the weekends. I don't have the brain power to calculate and track macros, so I just keep it basic. My lunch every single day during the week is a salt/peppered chicken breast, brown rice and trader joe's frozen broccoli; it's the easiest, healthiest and cheapest meal I can come up with because I suck at cooking. I always read ingredients lists and stay away from hydrogenated oil (trans fat) and anything that's full of a bunch of bullshit. I try to go easy on the sodium just to keep the water weight down and I don't ever drink soda or sugary drinks. Sugar comes from fruit. A gallon of water a day is important too, since it helps with reducing water weight and overall feel goodness. And there is nothing wrong with gazing as long as it's on good stuff and you keep a mental note of your calorie intake for the day. But to answer your question, I'm as strict with my diet as anyone else who cares about fitness and their well-being, but I'm not too crazy with it. My weakness is beer; I love drinking on the weekends!   Sorry for being all over the place, I'm not used to being asked about this stuff!"
Brogress,29npub,squatheavyeatbig,1 point,Mon Jul 14 02:16:34 2014 UTC,"Great.  I'm going to follow your workout for a few months, albeit at a far lesser intensity, I imagine.  I've been running 5k 3x a week and have dropped a few pounds, but everything's been vague in terms of my ultimate goals, You've helped to solidify where I'm going.    ....just keep that pussy whistle away from my wife.   ;)  Cheers man.  I imagine I'll start to see some results in a few months, but realistically, I'm not going to get where you're at for a few years, I'm guessing.  (I'm not fat, just got a little pudge, like most guys that sit on their ass most of the day)  btw, do you usually do 3 sets @ 15 reps or something?  that's probably what I'll go for and increase weight as Ic an.  At my stage, it will be about increasing weight, as I def need more muscle.  When I get somewhere around your level (I'm an optimist), I'll stop worrying about that shit."

Brogress,29mbma,tules,29,Fri Jul 4 08:14:28 2014 UTC,I'm so glad someone posted this. I'm straight and married with kids and I have explicitly told people on this sub they look hot after a transformation partly because it's true partly because I think we all need encouragement but mostly just because I don't care for social norms. It's semi neurotic the way people seem to constantly reestablish the fact they're not gay. Who even fucking cares?
Brogress,29mbma,Wanderlust917,20,Wed Jul 2 09:20:15 2014 UTC,"Who even fucking cares?     As is often the case, ""no homo"" says more about the mentality of the speaker than the substance of what he is saying.  It says that he has a need, planted there by society and likely fostered by his own insecurities, to publicly reaffirm his heterosexuality and distance himself from the substance of his own comments."

The other half are just being playful and would blush and apologize if they realized you were actually a homo. Being a fag-hater isn't cool anymore, especially when the fag is jacked and you're just compensating for your own insecurities.   Heck, I'll use 'no homo' when talking to other guys at the gym.

But, I just wanted to make sure that you do realize that it I don't think it's been used once seriously as an insult towards gay people. Idk if you're used to the term and if it's used where you're from, but as far as homophobic comments go, it's the most lighthearted one possible.  I don't want you to think that those comments come from some deep rooted homophobia is all. If that's not what you're thinking, great. Either way, if members are bothered by it it should go."
Brogress,29mbma,Name_Change,17,Wed Jul 2 21:19:01 2014 UTC,"""As far as homophobic comments go, it's the most lighthearted one possible."" This is kind of the problem with it. No homophobia is ok. Casual prejudice is still a bad thing. I know the vast majority of guys using the phrase aren't thinking about offending queer people when they use it,  but they are making reference to and identifying with a part of our culture that is very specifically homophobic, and that in itself is problematic. I don't think anyone was imagining a group of skinheads, rubbing their hands together behind their keyboards, maniacally plotting the slight annoyance of gay redditers, but there are a bunch of people using it and even if they don't know they're doing it, they're perpetuating a concept of masculinity as being harmed by noticing or commenting on or, god forbid, being attracted to another mans body, and that's the problem. It's the kind of lighthearted homophobia that flys under the radar as 'just joking' but its the kind of prejudice that we have the hardest time rooting out."

You look remarkably similar in the after picture here (at 170lbs) to your before pic in your bulking thread (at 145). In fact, I would say you look skinnier here. I can accept that you gained a lot in your legs, but it's surprising to say the least that you didn't manage to increase upper body mass at all after bulking so hard...just saying. You probably cut too hard and lost a decent amount of upper body gains; you did have torso gains at the top of your bulk, as can be seen in the pics."

As for looks, I don't think I changed much. However, a few guys around the gym have come up to me and complimented my size increase.   My strength increased significantly. Since before my bulk I weighed about 145-155. Now I am around 165-175. I gained about ~15 pounds of muscle.   My 145 before was after a week of dehydrating and no eating.

Currently, my diet consists of roughly 25g of carbs daily, and other than that it's purely protein and veggies. As far as calories and or grams of protein/fats/carbs, I honestly couldn't tell you. My workout split is chest, back, legs, upper chest, and arms/shoulders, alternating between calves and abs daily, with 25 minutes of post workout sprint intervals, followed by 20 minutes of low intensity jogging. As far as supplements go, I am taking a thermogenic, and a diuretic. I wanted to do my first show all natural to know how I would place solely off of genetics and hard work, hence the lack of any test or estrogen blockers. Any critiques would be more than welcome, as well as advice for my first peak week!"

Brogress,29gtn5,ayjayred,15,Mon Jun 30 13:50:08 2014 UTC,"I keep my lifting to one hour flat, with as little rest time as possible, roughly 15 minutes for calves, and then the 45 minutes of cardio. As of recent because of my heightened cardio, my workouts are pretty close to 2hr 15 min. In response to being wiped out during the workout, I'm totally exhausted. I've given up most of my social life to be at the gym, or meal prepping, so it's not like I do all the things a normal 19 year old does (drink, play video games, sleep an absurd amount), as well as lift that much. Sacrifices to my social life are definitely being made for the gainzz."
Brogress,29gtn5,fuweike,4,Mon Jun 30 14:11:24 2014 UTC,"one hour flat?!  impressive!  How many minutes of rest between sets of deadlifts do you take?  You say as little as possible, but I can't imagine a one minute rest being enough."
Brogress,29gtn5,fuweike,3,Mon Jun 30 14:49:25 2014 UTC,"How many minutes of rest time between sets?  Do you superset?  I find if I cut out rest periods between sets, my lifts are 10 or 20 pounds off what they'd be with a rest.  I'm torn between doing more sets at a lighter weight, and doing the most weight possible, but with rest times built in and correspondingly less sets."
Brogress,29gtn5,harvestchops,9,Mon Jun 30 14:55:22 2014 UTC,"Now that I'm cutting and depleted on carbs, I'm not necessarily concerned about the amount of weight that I'm putting up, so much as I am the level of muscle exhaustion that I can achieve. It's natural for your lift numbers to go down while on a cut. But as far as supersets go, the answer is yes. My goal is muscle failure, and supersets help me reach that much faster than single sets."
Brogress,29gtn5,fuweike,6,Mon Jun 30 16:29:05 2014 UTC,You really have a lot of experience and knowledge for a 19 year old.  Thanks for the advice.  I think I will work supersets into my routine and focus on muscle failure.
Brogress,29gtn5,harvestchops,1 point,Mon Jun 30 16:58:36 2014 UTC,"You should study more about failure before you go into it, for the past ten years every set to failure has been a no no in the natural body building community, the consensus tends to be last set to failure and some prefer positive failure. Super sets are great ,but last set and don't over do it. If you don't use drugs you should be working out more than once a week and you will get more gains from not taking every set to failure. Now if you are on test and are only doing once a week than by all means failure is good for most small movements, but doing it compound every set will likely over train you and cause some wheel spinning."
Brogress,29gtn5,Sleetza,1 point,Tue Jul 1 10:04:22 2014 UTC,"I train about 3-5 times a week, either doing a 5 day split, a SS style routine, or a 2 day split push/pull.  I've heard that going to the last rep to really ""push yourself"" is what counts and sets the elite apart.  If I do five sets of some exercise, shouldn't I be going all out, so I can just barely finish the last set?"
Brogress,29gtn5,DontNeedNoThneed,1 point,Tue Jul 1 14:30:56 2014 UTC,"The elite take drugs, naturals don't often get big enough to be considered elite. If you fail every set you over train, this over train causes you to lose mass and strength, but you will see yourself no reason you can't try and  see what it does to you specifically but I advise you measure once a month. When ever you do less reps than you did last week or are not able to add weight to the bar you can bet it was the every set to failure that is costing you efficiency and causing wheel spinning. You can get big doing every set to failure, that's how the old school guys used to do it, it just won't give you mass as fast after awhile unless of course you are on one day a week per muscle and using drugs. My first year I did every set to failure and only put on 18 pounds of muscle.Year 2 I followed current natural body building science and put on 24 pounds. As you can see I put on more my second year than my first doing the same 5 day split, this is rare with out drugs when someone has a proper routine and good diet. I just want you to look into it before you decide completely, just a heads up so to say so you can possibly save time. Failure is great, but it is very easy to over do it and cost gains with it."

Take your time, you'll see it eventually."
Brogress,29j6lm,skarples,6,Tue Jul 1 05:18:37 2014 UTC,"Definitely eat more. Peanut butter and oats--like have been suggested--are great ways of doing this. No need to skip breakfast; you can get quick oats if you don't feel you have time to cook rolled oats. Or just look up a recipe for overnight oats. Prepare your meals ahead of time, and keep snacks handy.  Honestly, I think your routine is probably what needs the most help. Gaining muscle and size takes a long time but based on your pictures I'm concerned you're taking a less than disciplined approach. If you were training hard and diet was the primary issue, I would have expected you to be in here complaining about how you're tired and irritable all the time. How often are you hitting the gym per week and what does your routine look like? If you don't have a set routine when you hit the gym (and I'm guessing you don't or you would have posted it by now), then that should be your top priority going forward. You should be doing compound lifts and a fair amount of accessory work if you want to get larger. An example of a day in the gym where your focus is on chest and triceps could like like this:  *Incline Bench press: pyramiding sets of 12, 10, 8, 6 reps  *Barbell Bench Press: pyramiding sets of 12, 10, 8, 6 reps  *Dumbbell flyes: 4 sets of 10 reps  *Chest dips: 4 sets of 10  *Skull Crushers/tricep extensions: 4 sets of 10 reps  *Tricep Pushdown (cables): 4 sets of 12 reps  This is the kind of volume you want to get that muscle growth going strong. You may have to reduce the weight you're lifting if this looks like a lot more work than you were doing before in the gym. You need to take this same approach with every other day in the gym where you're focusing on a set of muscle groups (or movements if you choose to do a push/pull/leg split). Leg days shouldn't just be about squats (although they're crucial), you should also be doing weighted lunges, romanian deadlifts, leg extensions, leg curls, calf raises, etc.  Definitely post your routine and we can help you improve it. A lot of people either start training too hard and don't have their nutrition right, and they just fall off of it because they end up too tired and cranky all the time. Just as many people hit the gym for a whole year and never realize great results because they aren't pushing their bodies hard enough."
Brogress,29j6lm,skarples,2,Tue Jul 1 18:27:22 2014 UTC,"I go to the gym 6 days a week. I'm on a chest/back, legs, arm split.  Chest day:  Bench 5x3 Incline Bench 5 x 3 Decline Bench 5 x 3 Lat pulldown 10 x 3 Row 10 x 3 Pec Flies 10 x 3 Abs  Legs: Squat 5 x 3  Leg press 5 x 3  Hamstring curls 10 x 3  Calf raises 10 x 3  Ab/Adductor 10 x 3  Leg Extensions 10 x 3  Abs  Arms: Shoulder Press 10 x 3(shoulder hurt, sometimes been skipping)  Shoulder raises 10 x 3(sometimes been skipping, hurt)  Barbell curls 10 x 3  Triceps pushdown 10 x 3  Skullcrushers 10 x 3 (wrist hurt, sometimes skip)  Tricept extensions 10 x 3 (wrist hurt, sometimes skip)  Forearm barbell extension things 10 x 3  Dumbell curls exhaustion  Abs  Rest Day  Repeat"
Brogress,29j6lm,bl1nds1ght,6,Wed Jul 2 03:03:27 2014 UTC,"Alrighty, leg day is looking alright. Though I think you could add in some weighted lunges, Romanian Deadlifts for hamstrings, and maybe use a hacksquat machine instead of the leg press for quads. The volume you're doing looks like it'd be good for building strength, which is probably what you want right now. But, from my own personal experience, I've found pyramiding sets that are in the 12-8 rep range have stimulated the most gains in muscle size. Many people suggest building foundational strength before doing those kinds of sets though.  Chest day looks a little problematic to me because you've thrown in lat pulldowns and rows. So you're essentially doing a chest and back day, which is fine, but I see you cheating your back a little on it. What I would do is transform your chest day and arm day to a chest/triceps day and a back/biceps day. This split will still develop your arms. Keep all the exercises you're doing on chest day except the lat pulldown and rows, and add in triceps pushdown, skull crushers, and dumbbell triceps kickbacks. Do the tricep work after your benches and flyes. You may think you're not effectively working out your triceps because your arms are already fatigued from the bench presses, but this is actually ideal.  Now, for Back and Biceps day, you should be starting off with deadlifts. You may be afraid to do them if you haven't before (I know I was initially), but they're extremely important. Start at a low weight and very slowly work your way up. Just do your typical 5 x 3 sets like you're doing with squats on the deadlifts. Then do your lat pulldowns, your rows, add some one arm dumbbell lifts (chainsaws), and then do barbell curls, hammer curls, and concentration curls.  I usually have a separate day for shoulders and traps, where I'm doing overhead press or arnold's, lateral raises, front raises, upright rows, and shrugs. If you're experiencing pain doing front or lateral raises, don't be afraid to reduce weight, and pay attention to your range of motion. Your elbows should be lining up with your shoulders at the top of the movement. I've found that going higher than that can result in some pain in my own shoulders. Warming up your shoulders with overhead presses or Arnold Presses can really help with discomfort as well when you start isolating the delts.  All in all, my takeaway from looking at your routine is that there are too few compound movements, and you may be giving yourself too much rest time. Try to keep rest times in between sets between 60-90 seconds.  If you really like having an arm day, check out the BUFF Dudes 12 week plan that alternates an arm day into a couple of its phases. You may get an idea for how you might want to modify your workout plan based on what excites you in the gym. The kind of volume in this plan is, in my mind, what you need to really start seeing gains. And, in 3 months time, you won't have trouble visualizing your progress. It'll be evident.  http://buffdudes.blogspot.com/2014/04/buff-dudes-12-week-plan.html"

Brogress,29j6lm,tomdizzo,2,Tue Jul 1 12:38:10 2014 UTC,Dude this takes a hell of a long time. As long as you're eating enough to gain 1-3lbs per month and increasing in strength you can't not make gains. But try looking at gaining in terms of years instead of months.  Cutting takes weeks/months. Gaining significant size takes years.
Brogress,29j6lm,brogressta,1 point,Tue Jul 1 10:39:56 2014 UTC,Seems like you need to get some weight going. Start eating more whats ur weight now?
Brogress,29j6lm,BTBLAM,1 point,Tue Jul 1 08:14:40 2014 UTC,I'm 145 lbs now. I have trouble eating alot. My house has a bug infestation and I don't like keeping food there. I work 7 am -7pm in a hospital and have very little break for lunch. I skip breakfast because most places aren't open. I eat a ~800 calorie lunch and feel very full. I eat a ~1000 calorie dinner and also feel very full. I drink a 40g protein drink before bed. What else can I add to my diet that's very high in calories but not filling?
Brogress,29j6lm,TofuMignon,11,Tue Jul 1 13:09:34 2014 UTC,"Hey, never skip breakfast. Buy some rolled oats, store them in tupperware (air & water tight) to protect them from the bugs. scoop some out into smaller tupperware (the size of a cereal bowl), and chuck in a scoop of protein powder and some water, and eat the oats when you get to work.  I work as a nurse, in a hospital. Even with 12 hour shifts, there's no excuse to skip breakfast."

Brogress,29fy64,Chaseism,7,Mon Jun 30 03:24:07 2014 UTC,"I figured after making that butthurt post a little bit ago complaining about this sub that I was being hypocritical by not posting my own progress, so here it is. If you want a little insight to my progress so far keep reading.   ROUTINE  For the first 7 months (January to end of June) I did SL 5x5 and made mainly strength gains, but was pretty t-rex mode and lost very little weight. I went to Greece for 2 months after (July and August) and lost quite a bit of my gains that I had made, but still kept some strength. When I got back I had tried to go back on SL for a month, but realized that this wasn't working after looking at myself in the mirror.  From October to May/June when the pics were taken I wen't on a very strict cut and followed a P.H.A.T. style routine with quite a few modifications (that I can go into if anybody cares enough).  It was over those 8-9 months where I've seen the most progress and I am continuing that until September where I will bulk again and follow a more strength based program until my numbers reach the point I want them to.  Speaking of lifts, my current numbers are:  Bench - Haven't maxed out, and do alot of incline DB work. Right now my incline DB presses are 85lbs for 3-5 reps. This is definitely a weak spot  Squat - Hit 275*4, no idea what my 1RM is. This was belted though so it doesn't really count.  Deadlift - 315*4, don't know 1RM and this was using chalk and belt so again I don't really count it.  Tbar - I do these instead of barbell rows, and they're my favorite exercise so I'm listing them dammit. Currently pulling 225*5.  DIET  I've seen the most gains in the past 2 months of dieting, even though I've been cutting for 8 months. I attribute this to still learning the ins and outs of counting and planning meals and really fixing my diet, since this is the first time I've ever really dieted strictly. For the past 2 months I've been using /u/awinnarisyou 's dieting plan that he talked about in his post here. I'm currently trying to maintain the level I am, because while I'm not very lean I feel like If I lose more I'll just look puny (My waist is 29"" right now and I can't afford new pants). I figure I'll go on a bulk and gain more muscle and cut again in a bit. Plus I feel like taking a break from cutting for a bit will do some good to my sanity.   TLDR-  Well, that's that. While my gains haven't been as good as I hoped for the time frame, I'm still learning a lot and trying to get better. Please, I would REALLY appreciate it if you tore me a new one. I know I have a lot to improve on and getting new insight on where I should go from here would be perfect. Thanks again guys"
Brogress,29fy64,dieek,12,Mon Jun 30 03:24:12 2014 UTC,Using chalk and a belt doesn't invalidate the lift.

Brogress,29fy64,hakujin214,4,Mon Jun 30 04:27:42 2014 UTC,"Alright, wall of text coming up so if there is a better way of formatting it let me know and I'll make an edit!  Using the template that I showed up there, I made these changes:  Day 1 - Upper Body Power Day   T-bar rows instead of bent over rows (personal preference is the only reason behind this) Took out rack chins cause I didn't feel they were worth waiting for a machine over, but if you have a free smith machine go ahead Inlcine DB press instead of Flat The order I do em in is Inlcine DB Bench -> Tbar -> Dips -> Pullupsi Preacher curls instead of cambered bar curls. Make the last set a drop set as well Add heavy shrugs - 3 sets 6-10 reps Add either dumbbell pullovers, heavy lat pulldowns, or lateral raises   Day 2 - Lower Body Power  Lately, I've been doing Lower Body Power Workouts for both leg days. It rose my numbers a bit, but my legs are my weakest area by far so I need to improve them, so I feel like following the template would be better for you than following what I do, but here are my mod's anyway.    Hack squats - only do if the machine for them is there. I feel like barbell hack squats are ridiculous Do actual deadlifts for 3 sets of 3-5 reps instead of stiff legged deadlifts. Personal preference Do the standing calf raises on a smith machine with my feet elevated so I get more depth.    Day 3 - Rest On this day I do slight accessory work like abs. I'll try to go to the gym but if I don't I won't hate myself. I also do more calve work on this day, making me hit calves 4 a week.   Cable crunches 3x20 Hanging leg raises 3x10 Back extensions 3x20 (holding a 45lb plate to my chest) Seated calf raises 3x 16-20 Standing calf raise 3x 16-20   Cardio if I'm feeling frisky  Day 4 - Back and Shoulder Hypertrophy   Tbar rows - 3x12 instead of what it says there. No rack chins Last set of pulldowns a drop set Last set of lateral raises a drop set Add rear delt cable flys 3x8-12 Add DB pullovers, 3x 12-15 Add DB shrugs, 3x12-15 Add pullups, done throughout day at home.   Day 5 - Lower Body Hypertrophy  I did the same thing this day as the lower body power day. This is in part due to laziness on my side and not wanting to squat for so many reps. I don't think I did my routine was right, but squatting for 6x3 like the template says did absolutely nothing for me.  Day 6 Chest and Arms Hypertrophy   FIRST DO Incline DB bench - 3x8-12, THEN flat Flat DB bench - 3x8-12 Last set of preacher curls is a drop set I use a dumbbell for the seated tricep extensions. Last set of cable pressdowns is a drop set Add more are work at the end if I'm feeling it, most often in the form of chin ups, but I might do unweighted dips here too.    Day 7 - Rest   Same as the rest for day 3.  KEEP IN MIND, these are the CHANGES I made. If I didn't address an exercise in this comment that is in the template, that means I did it how it was described in the template.  Edit - I didn't have any real problems with skin yet. I think it's because I wasn't dieting that well and my macros weren't smart, so I lost the weight fairly slowly. I still have a bit of lower belly fat though, so if I lose that I might have a problem. I found that being SUPER hydrated at all times as well as taking care of your skin helped a little too."

Brogress,29fy64,WKCLC,3,Mon Jun 30 15:26:03 2014 UTC,This was belted though so it doesn't really count.   How does it not count if it's belted? It's not like the belt is actually lifting the weight for you.

Brogress,29fy64,Dr_Max_Gluteus,3,Mon Jun 30 14:08:29 2014 UTC,Well they don't know what they're talking about. The raw classification still allows you to use a belt.

I went from 165-ish to 190 before I started cutting, and by the time 6 months passed exactly, I cut a ridiculous amount of fat to about 172-ish to get back near my original weight. I'm about 5'8, so not sure exactly how it compares to OP."
Brogress,29g1b3,merrickx,-1,Mon Jun 30 07:23:27 2014 UTC,"I think its important to point out that i was 180lbs and in very good shape prior to my depression. I was a college athlete and actively lifting. I really believe a lot of it has to do with me not participating in athletics on a daily basis, allowing my body to pack on mass. Doubling that with more power lifts versus conditioning i use to do for college, muscle mass builds.   Also, as far as genetics goes, my father (shorter stature) use to do power lifting competitions, and as for my brother, he was a great athlete in his own right.  I can't prove it other than video taping a piss test for all of reddit to see lo, so you are welcome to your own opinions."
Brogress,29g1b3,hotrod101,4,Thu Jul 3 01:14:26 2014 UTC,One of your progress pics starts in February at 167lbs and then in March at 187lbs. 20lbs in one month is not steady progress.

Why is it an issue if someone used steroids or ""gear"" to get there? I can understand the downside and health issues with steroids, I guess I don't understand why people get offensive about it.  I personally don't care how one gets there, I can appreciate the work put in to get there (with drugs or naturally). Really I feel that it doesn't matter how you get to the build you want, as long as you get there.

You can use all these cheats that make the game that easier to beat, to get to your ultimate goal of winning. But i know i would feel a LOT more accomplished by not using those cheats and beating it on my own.  So when i get to be in ""good"" shape and someone accuses me of it, then all the hard work and sweat i put in to it is seen in someone else's eyes as ""cheating"".. That i couldn't do it without shortcuts. Its questioning my integrity when i say i am natural.   Couple that with the side affects and potential of cancer...Not for me.

Brogress,29g1b3,hr_shovenstuff,4,Mon Jun 30 05:11:59 2014 UTC,You can put on mass a lot quicker than 'typical standards' if you're underweight. I'm guessing 167lbs at 6'1 is somewhat underweight.
Brogress,29g1b3,hr_shovenstuff,2,Mon Jun 30 05:14:42 2014 UTC,"167 is not considered underweight at 6'1, although it is on the lower end of what is considered ""normal weight"".   Just for perspective, I am 6'1 and I started out at around 150. I have been lifting for almost a year, eating necessary calories, and going to the gym regularly. I weight in at a little over 176 right now.   This guy gained over 40lbs of muscle in 4 months. Even if he was truly underweight, gaining that much muscle in that short amount of time is definitely not natural."
Brogress,29g1b3,rocketkielbasa,2,Mon Jun 30 05:22:18 2014 UTC,"He looks leaner int he before pic, so I wouldn't say 40lbs of muscle. He also had a history of lifting, which makes it easier to gain the muscle back.  I'm not arguing one way or the other whether he is, or isn't on steroids, growth hormone or insulin. I'm just pointing out some facts to take into account."
Brogress,29g1b3,antpocas,4,Mon Jun 30 07:34:46 2014 UTC,"as happy as i am with my progress, i definitely didn't gain 40lbs of straight muscle. I would be willing to bet i had lower BF% in the first pic."

Everyone bigger than me is on roids.  No but srsly, if you lost 15 lbs in a month, it bounces back pretty fast. Especially because you know what you need to do, know you can do it, and actually know what hard work is like.  Also, you're not really that strong for 210 lbs. If you were on roids for 4 months I would damned well hope you squatted more than 315x3."

Brogress,29dr8o,Letsplaywithfire,5,Sun Jun 29 10:32:31 2014 UTC,So in the previously pic my lifts were from memory around Bench: 110kg Squat: 140kg Dead: 170kg  Now they are around  Bench: 145kg Squat: 195kg Deadlift: around 210 to 215 (untested)   I have been following PHAT and as a result really been trying to bring up my squat as I havn't had a deadlift in my weekly program. Occasionally I have put in rack pulls but not a heap. It will be interesting to see how my deadlift improves if/when I swap it out for back squats. Last time a deadlifted was 200kg for one and my last rack pull was 220 for 4 reps. Any other questions just let me know.   Edit: meant to put this in too  http://i.imgur.com/nQ2BOlD.jpg

Brogress,28zd9v,thesorrow312,2,Wed Jun 25 15:53:03 2014 UTC,Count your calories dude. 300 calorie surplus per day should get you about 1lb gained per week. This is a good way to put on mass but make sure its quality and not mostly fat. Or you can go even slower and literally add 200 calories worth of protein shake per day to what you already eat.

Brogress,28xn04,hr_shovenstuff,2,Wed Jun 25 06:54:01 2014 UTC,"Oh no, I lost 40 lbs in 6 months. Ha ha, guess I could've titled that better. Initially I was doing a purely cutting circuit for 6 weeks. 10x10 resting 30 seconds between sets and doing high rep accessory work as super sets with no rest. I was doing that 6 days a week. Once I hit 245 I upped my calories from 2200 to about 2600 and added extra carbs and replaced fats (current macros 210 c , 240 p, 100 f). Since then weight loss has slowed drastically but I'm getting leaner fairly quickly. I don't really want to drop below 225-230 so I know it's going to a longer process to really lean out but I've got a year before summer (I never expected to be beach ready this year). Since I upped my calories I'm seeing a pretty steady strength gain so I will keep using my current routine until that stalls out.current routine is a 4 days, everything gets hit twice.   Monday: chest/ back/ bis/ abs  flat bench - 4 x 10, 8, 6, 2-4 (ex. 145x10, 205x 8, 235 x 6, 285x4 or to fail)  Rack pulls - same set up, resting until recovered  Db incline bench superset with bent over row - 4x 6-10 as heavy as possible  Decline bench superset with T bar row 4x6-10  Db incline superset with db bent over row 4x6-10  Barbell curl down superset with decline weighted sit up 4x10-15  Ez bar preacher curlsuperset with leg raise 4x10- 15  Rest max 90 seconds b/t super sets  Tuesday: legs (front focus)/ shoulders/ traps/ tris  front Squat - 4x10, 8, 6, 4          overhead press 4x 10, 8, 6, 4   For accessories follow same pattern as Monday, superset a leg with a shoulder for 3 excersizes with a 4x 6-10 as heavy as you can set/rep   And 2 trap excersizes with 2 tri excersizes for the same.  Rest Wednesday  Thursday: chest/back/bi/ab  Incline bench - 4x10,8,6,4  Wide grip pull down 4x10,8,6,4  Same deal with accessories  Friday - legs (rear focus) / shoulders/ traps/ tris  Back squat - 4x 10,8,6,4  Upright row - 4x10,8,6,4  Same deal with accessories. The accessory selection doesn't matter as much as long as you go heavy enough to fail around 11 reps.  Every workout ends with 2 rounds of tabata.   I'm lucky enough to have a job that I work a lot of nights so I can get to the gym on off hours. The whole workout takes about an hour an 45 minutes but I've seen good results on it.  Not quite as impressive to lose 40 as gain it I imagine. We get at tested at work for just anything so I don't want to risk taking anything that could pop me. My job is WAY to good for that!"

Brogress,28rrlt,internet_badass_here,17,Sun Jun 22 06:03:29 2014 UTC,"You've made great progress, but unfortunately I don't think the chest issue will resolve itself without surgery, so you should definitely research that option. Skin tends to be fairly resilient, but even so it can only shrink back so much. The good news is that the problem should be easy to solve, and after surgery you should look perfectly normal."

I'm thinking that a little more cutting will do me good, im thinking 165-170ish. However, I do understand that the tits might not go away without surgery but i've decided to get a little leaner, keep lifting heavy and to wait a few years before seriously considering surgery as a last resort. Maybe it will resolve itself, maybe not. It's not that big of a deal to me, it still bothers me mentally a little but people around me don't really care and it doesnt cause me any real discomfort.

Brogress,28k2xy,Organspender,7,Thu Jun 19 17:01:51 2014 UTC,I got fat pretty quick after I started bulking so its hard to say how much lean mass I actually gained after a year.

And I pulled 325 for 9 this morning on the deadlift.  I have no idea what my 1 rep maxes are anymore after my time off and injury but before all that I hit 455 dead, 380 squat and 250 bench.  My upper body lifts are definitely going to be my focal point going forward.  As far as food, I got down to around 2500 cals for my most recent cut with a weekly refeed.  I wasn't doing any cardio.  And for bulking I was up to 3800 cals with a free meal every week which was something on the order of a entire pizza.   I am hoping to approach 220 in the next couple of years as well.  I would like to compete in powerlifting at that weight class."

Brogress,28k2xy,IntellegentIdiot,3,Mon Jun 23 01:34:49 2014 UTC,"Feel free to ask any questions. I used several different styles of training during this time as well as different types of diets.  I most enjoy hybrid routines where I have a couple of heavier compounds lifts each day followed by bodybuilding accessories lifts.    My biggest hurdle came in 2013 when I developed severe insomnia and couldn't train for 7 months because of it.  Once I came back to the gym, after the insomnia was under control, I ended up with triceps tendonitis and lost another 2 months at the end of 2013 rehabbing that.    To get to where I am today I used a modified PHAT routine and cut from 215 to 198 from January to today.  During this cut I have regained most of my former strength and haven't had any issues with my tendonitis.  I am currently 2 weeks into my reverse diet and its going really well.  I look fuller than I did 2 weeks ago and feel so much better, thank you carb Jesus.  I plan on sticking to the modified PHAT routine and really focusing on my upper body this next year going forward.    Thanks!"

Quit smoking weed, taking caffiene in all it's forms, and playing video games 3 months ago, as a result have been training and sparring particularly hard. First time I weight myself was probably 2010, was about 195lbs, 185lbs after starting strength, cruised at about 175 for several years and am now at what I consider to be my athletic peak at 165lbs.

You lost some size that would have looked great with a proper cut, but honestly you look great, and it's an easier look to maintain, I think. I'm 5'10 170, I bulked to about 190, then got injured and dropped 20lbs. I look like you did in your before picture right now and I want those abs man. Good work.   Also, good on you for quitting video games and smoking. I don't smoke, but I started playing games again last month after a 5 month break. I do really enjoy playing with my friends, but man they can seriously suck up time."
Brogress,28aqtc,borntoperform,4,Mon Jun 16 20:31:00 2014 UTC,"Thanks my friend! I could be totally wrong, 100% wrong, 50% wrong, whatever. But I really think that alot of people walk on eggshells when they post shit. It's just the human condition - It's no different in day to day life. Everybody has a filter for fear of being ostracized, it's totally normal, I still have it but I feel like it's waning as time goes on and I get more philosophical, which might explain the downvotes.  It's honestly extremely easy to maintain, diet-wise at least. Aesthetics are not my primary concern, my primary concern is performance, and getting too big for me (in my sport) I think means sacrificing flexibility and endurance. Physiques are most definitely made in the kitchen, but in my opinion, athletic performance is only supplemented by diet - Athletic performance comes from unyielding dedication and training, and learning proper technique. I really think a big part of being healthy comes from focusing on athletics and not physique, but that too is a controversial statement, so I'll leave it at that."

Brogress,288d9g,limitedaccount,32,Mon Jun 16 05:23:50 2014 UTC,"Lifting split is Chest/Back, Arms/Shoulders, Legs all 2x a week, 1 day off.   Breakfast is a big bowl of oatmeal for carbs, then right after I hit the gym. After gym I eat lean chicken breast, brown rice, and broccoli. Then at night I make 6 eggs and some more chicken. Fruits in between as snacks. Approx. 2600 calories a day.  Here's an example of lunch (rice not pictured).   http://i.imgur.com/GEHrWqv.jpg  EDIT:  My lifts are as follows,  335 Bench, 365 squat, 455 deadlift.   Squat is shit since I squat ass to grass. A side goal I have is a 3 plate bench press, 4 plate squat, and 5 plate deadlift. But that secondary to getting fucking huge :)  EDIT 2: Workout in depth  Chest/Back:  Bench press is the main focus of the chest part of the day, especially incline. 5x10 on both flat and incline bench press, then various accessory movements such as flys.  For the back part of the workout I love to do pullups, cable rows, and overhead pulls, along with various other accessory movements.  Arms and shoulders day:  Half of the workout focuses on shoulders and the other half on arms. Main focus of the shoulder portion is some variation of overhead press, combine that with lateral raises, front raises, bent over backwards flys(Idk if that's what it's called...) and whatever else I feel like doing.  Then moving on to triceps, skullcrushers are the main focus of this portion. Then rope pulldowns and overhead extentions and dips.  Then to biceps...bunch of curl variations, not much to say here.  Then forearms, wrist curls, backwards wrist curls, stuff like that.  Finally, leg day!  Squats, loads of squats, followed by deadlifts, loads of deadlifts! Anywhere from 5x10 to 8x10 on both.   Then leg extentions and curls, and lunges, and good mornings and other accessory stuff, followed by calves.  Oh also, I hit abs every other day, and calves every other day at the end of the workout, just before cardio. So if I'm doing abs, next day is calves, leg days I do both abs and calves.  Everyday 20 min of cardio. Everything 2x a week 1 day off.  EDIT 3:   A commenter has brought to my attention that the timeframe of my progress is skewed! I was not 100% certain about the time frame of my transformation so I just went off the dates I posted the pictures onto imgur, upon further thought I believe this progress was over approximately 8 months. Apologies for the mistake, I had no intentions of misinforming!   EDIT 4:  I felt so bad about misinforming you guys about the date that I decided to go into my phone and find the EXIF data for the picture so I could know the exact date!   http://i.imgur.com/XACKbuq.png?1  The picture was taken on 9/28/13, that date and today are 260 days apart. That is just over 8 and a half months apart.  Once again apologies for the mistake! :("

They have the dedication to put in 100s of hours into getting a small stat bonus or becoming a better player, I think that translates into their workout habits should they choose to workout.

Saturdays are a hardcore clean and jerk day - work on form, work up to max, try to PR then do a 1rep x 15 min emom @ 75-80%. My SL and c&j days are all heavy weight. None of them include an 8-15 rep range workout unless it's a warmup with very light weight. I've been doing everything in 3-5 rep range.  The only thing I've been really tracking is protein intake. I've been eating more carbs and less fat after heavy lifting. Then on off days I eat less carbs and more fat.  edit: I should probably just make my own thread instead of hijacking this dudes."

Then on off days I eat less carbs and more fat.   You need to track your calories and macros.  Write down everything you eat each day, and then see how many calories it is, and what the break-down of fat, protein, and carbs is.  If you're serious about looking like OP, you can't just guess at what you're eating.  You have to know how much you're eating so you can be sure it's the right amount.  I was trying to do a bulk a few years ago and thought I was eating 5500 or more calories a day.  It turns out it was less than 4000.  I was off by a ton."

I have been using it for a little over 2 weeks and already I can see physical changes in my body.

Brogress,28035u,MakesMyPantsTight,6,Fri Jun 13 14:22:53 2014 UTC,"My routine is gym 5-6 times a week. I've been training about 12 years now and what works for me is slow, quality reps in the 5-8 range. I'll do around 5 exercises per visit taking me about 45 mins in the weight room. Cardio after (20mins), and I walk to and from the gym (15min each way). I run 5-10k once a week, and sometimes walk 3k to work and back.  Diet? IIFYM. I eat pretty much what I like as long as I track EVERYTHING on myfitnesspal, and if I want to pig out I make myself earn calories with exercise. I aim for 1800 a day, and even if I don't quite make it then 2000 is still good. I'm a massive snacker so I keep alternatives in the house on hand - boiled eggs, chicken, peanut butter. If I don't buy crap food I'm less likely to eat it. I normally cheat on Saturday (sometimes 3000 cal or more).  No steroids or anything, and while I do have protein powder I only have it about once a fortnight."

If you haven't already, try the low-bar position. It feels way more secure on my back and more stable on the way down. Work on hip and ankle mobility. How far you can sink down in that hole to break parallel will be determined by how flexible your hips are... WORK ON IT. Every day find something to hold on to and get into the squat position. Stretch with the movement. Don't be afraid to use plates to raise your heels up. Giving your ankles more room to move forward will help tremendously. If you can, invest in some lifting shoes with a raised heel. I have the Adipowers by Adidas. Best investment I've made by far for squats.  https://m.imgur.com/gDZ1zaa (if you don't look constipated, you're doing it wrong)  Deadlifts... Honestly, i never had problems moving a lot of weight with a conventional stance, but I do have problems keeping my upper back from rounding, which is apparently okay in the powerlifting community if you're working at maximal loads. It feels much more natural and powerful. I've actually injured myself more than once trying to keep my back straight. It doesn't feel right. As long as my lower back is right, I feel fine. A few months ago I switched to sumo stance and I can keep my back straight that way but can't move as much weight.  https://m.imgur.com/mpdS6LH  EDIT: FILM YOURSELF PRACTICING.

You're in a perfect position now to pack on decent muscle due to your low levels of bodyfat. Currently your insulin sensitivity and protein synthesis levels are high and if you take advantage of this by eating about 300-500 calories above maintenance and doing some form of weight training you can expect decent gains to be made.  In regards to where to move on from here, well I suppose that's totally up to you. If you're interested in aesthetics and mass, I'd recommend doing a bodybuilding split. If your interested in increasing strength then you can do a program like SS, SL, 5/3/1, the Texas method, etc. depending on what stage of the lifting life cycle you're at."
Brogress,27s86z,tules,2,Tue Jun 10 13:55:13 2014 UTC,"I've been doing a bit of weight training already. You might be surprised to hear I can bench 90kg for 5 reps. Haven't really been doing much else though apart from body weight squats because the gym I'm at sucks and doesn't have much equipment. Gonna start at a new gym next week and start doing heavy rows and deadlifts. Thanks for the advice, exactly what I was looking for."
Brogress,27s86z,Aussieboy111,2,Tue Jun 10 14:02:27 2014 UTC,"Nice work, brother. According to Strength Standards at your bodyweight (67 kg's) benching 90 kg for 5 reps puts you in the 'advanced lifter' category."
Brogress,27s86z,tules,2,Tue Jun 10 14:09:07 2014 UTC,"Thanks. I have a good bench for my weight, but at 5'11"" I should definitely weigh more than 67kg. I've always struggled to gain weight. The most I've ever weighed was 70kg."

No offense to OP, since he just started deadlifting, but doing a linear program you should be able to get there in 18 monthsish.

Brogress,27nj5z,DudeLikeYeah,2,Sun Jun 8 23:18:12 2014 UTC,"The only difference i see is better lighting and a filter.  If you are trying to cut, count your macros and eat at deficit sized according to your goals, generally 500 calorie deficit a day. Cut down volume as needed.  Bulking advice, eat above maintenance according to your goals. Usually 500 calorie surplus a day. Increase volume and weights.   Its really pretty simple, but not always easy its easy to fail non both ends if you are weak minded, or simply can't handle one or the other because of other goals in your life that take priority."

Brogress,27jyye,InlineReaper,9,Sat Jun 7 16:23:01 2014 UTC,"Thanks very much, first and foremost!  Routine/Macros:  God, this was all over the place. Lemme try to break it down.   First couple weeks, did this, but I didn't feel the burn enough. Around my first progress pic (2 weeks in) I switched to this because I saw the name and thought it fit my needs. Cause that's how you pick a routine. 12 weeks in, I came to my damn senses and switched to this, which was designed by a friend of mine who just got his bachelor's in Kinesiology. Seeing as how I was beginning a Master's in English, I wanted to go with what would be most efficient. Stuck with this for 6 months. The last three months I was on this, which I loved. Great routine, got me in the gym more often, yet it was still manageable.   As for macros, in the first three months I just tried to eat as little as possible while having a cheat meal every couple weeks. Seemed to work!  Transitioned to a 6-month bulk where I only watched protein and calories, which was good-not-great, so in future I'll be monitoring carbs and fats more closely.  Final 3-month cut I cut carbs almost entirely for a few weeks and slowly began to increase my intake. I also did intermittent fasting and carb cycling, and the last month I added sprints. :)  Starting 1RMs:  Oh LAWD no.  Starting squat: 95 lbs.  Starting bench: 95 lbs.  Starting dead: 135 lbs.  Diet:  I cut HARD (way too hard, to be honest) for three months, bulked for another 6, and then cut for 3.  195.1 -> 162.4 -> 184.8 -> 164.0  Any other questions? :)"

Brogress,27gzsz,fuweike,3,Fri Jun 6 19:32:50 2014 UTC,17 pounds of muscle gain in 6 months??  That is hardcore man!!  I have gained 20lbs of muscle in a year!  God to be 17-19 again!  At 30 this shit takes for fucking EVER!  Good progress man keep it up!  Don't stop when you hit that plateau (which you will soon if your natty.)
Brogress,27gzsz,Dirty_Parry,3,Fri Jun 6 19:38:43 2014 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah I can definitely sense that plateau coming, but a lot of the weight came from me being so skinny during cross country, to being a normal weight to being where I'm at now, so I think there are still a lot more gains to be made at a rapid pace! I also have been using a mass gainer to make sure I'm always in a calorie surplus."
Brogress,27gzsz,cumaboardladies,3,Fri Jun 6 21:29:47 2014 UTC,Any tips on how you got your serratus muscles to pop like that?  Nice work!

Funny that you mention that, I just finished 12 weeks of a program that Hugh Jackman used for the movie The Wolverine.   http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/mutant-strength-hugh-jackmans-wolverine-workout-plan.html  The routine focuses on short intervals of resting periods between sets, as well as progressively lowering the reps and raising the weight as you start each new week. I want to put on about 10 more pounds so I'll be switching to a 5x5 program."

Brogress,27fweq,OnceAteABurgerAMA,1 point,Fri Jun 6 13:47:20 2014 UTC,I need the answer to this. I'm currently trying to do this same thing
Brogress,27fweq,kentukyfriedbullshit,9,Fri Jun 6 06:09:34 2014 UTC,routine and diet please.
Brogress,27fweq,xedk,15,Fri Jun 6 04:11:39 2014 UTC,"Cardio I have been ignoring cardio for the first 6-7 months of working out. Now that I learned to not ignore it, I am loving it. I would ignore it mainly because it was too hard for me to do because of my knees and because I didn't know how to breathe properly. (excuses, excuses)  I decided to run 10 minutes before working out every day and that didn't even get me to a mile. Yesterday I ran it in 6:40, which is amazing for me.  CHEST!   Bench. I start with 135 and go up to 185 and drop to 135 again. I start by doing 8 reps at a time but as soon as I'm done with 185, I start to lift until failure. Basically first 135 lift is x8 but last is between 8 to 15 depending on the day. Dumbell flys. I start doing this right after the bench. Close grip pull ups.   After this I listen to my body. I may go work on another part of my body and let the blood leave the muscles a bit. I try not to hurt muscles by having too much pump. It becomes painful and I feel like it takes longer to heal that way.  ABS  I work my abs every other day. If I do upper abs one day it will be lower abs next time.   Workouts I like: Plank, sit ups, leg raises, dragon fly(imagine abs were chest and you were maxing) and some more planking!  Back   Pull ups and a lot of it. I try to do my pull ups as slow  and painful as possible. My upper back is a trooper! It does not let me down. Heals fast and I love that.  Sitting cable row: I do it just as I do bench. Start low weights go high and go low again. Bent rows: I use dumbells and I do it until my grip can no longer hold the weights.  T bar: it's a workout I do at the beginning of my workout but my least favorite. I start low weight and go high. 3 sets only.   Quads   Squats: Both my knees are injured therefore I can't lift heavy with my knees bent. I use the squat machine and I can go up to 300lbs but 300lbs on that machine is a lot easier than 300lbs raw weight at the rack. I don't go lower than 90 degrees either.  Leg extensions: I like this one. I work each leg separately on same weight same reps.   and other leg machines they have that looks like you are about to give birth.  Biceps   Curls(duh): Wide and close grip barbell curls. Start low weight and go max then drop down again. Parallel pull ups. I do love these. Hammer curls: After each arm workout I do these. I use heavy weight and do 10 each and continue for a super set with lower weight.   Calves My calves mainly work by running. I always run on my toes and they get a lot of workout from that. Apart from running I do body weighted calf raises and weighted calf raises. They do seem to get better workout if I do slow movements.  lower back  Back extensions and deadlifts.  to be continued."
Brogress,27fweq,urgencyy,2,Fri Jun 6 07:14:31 2014 UTC,you should avoid leg extensions if you have knee issues  http://www.t-nation.com/article/performance_training/the_truth_about_leg_extensions&cr=
Brogress,27fweq,kentukyfriedbullshit,1 point,Fri Jun 6 22:25:00 2014 UTC,Thank you for this. The reason I do them was because the only time I get pain is when I'm doing breaking movements which I did a lot in soccer and squats. I didn't feel pain or discomfort during extensions. I'll reconsider it.

Brogress,27fweq,trevorparsons,3,Fri Jun 6 03:41:08 2014 UTC,Well diet changed a lot of things. They were right when they said diet is 50% of becoming better because the day I decided to stop drinking soda is the day it started to change. I only drink water and milk(unless there is a special occasion) I try to eat a lot of hard boiled eggs.  My diet is still bad even though I changed a lot.  My daily food intake looks like this;  Milk and pop tarts for breakfast. Fruit salad or Turkey sandwich for lunch Banana before going to gym. Anything lean for dinner. It can be chicken breast or a big big salad. If I want to get takeout I get asian chicken from panda express.
Brogress,27fweq,That_One_Reference,2,Fri Jun 6 07:21:17 2014 UTC,"Very nice brogress!  Do you drink alcohol much, or did you cut it out of your life? I'm afraid to start a long term routine and lose my bar (beer) time. I'd obviously cut back regardless though."
Brogress,27fweq,beefyliltank,1 point,Fri Jun 6 15:46:41 2014 UTC,I drank alcohol 3 times this week and that was more than usual for me. I never buy beer to drink at home.

Brogress,278lg9,Muscle-UpVote,2,Wed Jun 4 10:04:22 2014 UTC,I would say that you're making good progress and you should keep cutting. That being said you should listen to your body so if you feel that cutting is taking a toll you could start a lean bulk with some HIIT thrown in.
Brogress,278lg9,Aussieboy111,1 point,Tue Jun 3 22:25:23 2014 UTC,"The cut looks a bit slow going, but a good improvement - I would start lifting heavier and working out harder. I see fat loss for sure but not much muscle growth, I would gain for muscle - you will gain some fat back but, if you cut and cut and don't grow muscle you will just look skinny.   Although looking at your bodybuilding.com post you have come a long way and you already look much better, don't be afraid of the bulk, lift hard and the muscle will come :)"
Brogress,278lg9,LadyBran,1 point,Wed Jun 4 11:08:15 2014 UTC,"First of all I just want to say nice work, brother on losing 20 lbs. My personal advice would be to continue cutting until you get to around 15% bodyfat (you can use this as a rough guide) because your body is in a more favourable hormonal position when lean. Lower levels of body fat mean that you are generally more sensitive to insulin and have a higher rate of protein synthesis. This gives you a very solid foundation to work from when you do decide to pack on the muscle."
Brogress,278lg9,Aussieboy111,1 point,Wed Jun 4 13:25:49 2014 UTC,"http://puu.sh/9eZyD/9bdf0b46bb.png  This one puts me around ~14%, and it's definitely one of the most accurate online. (Found it in /r/advancednutrition) Not 100% accurate for sure, but I'd say I'm ~16% bf with little muscle mass."
Brogress,278lg9,FiveDollarShake,2,Wed Jun 4 18:34:33 2014 UTC,imo you are around 18%
Brogress,278lg9,TruKiller,1 point,Wed Jun 4 20:01:27 2014 UTC,"That may be the case but you do have little muscle mass underneath. Maybe cut for a little while more and get to less than 10% bf and then do a slow bulk at around 300-500 calories over maintenance. This gives a good summary ---> ""Get lean.  Gradually add size.  Repeat the process"". There's no need to ever go beyond 20% bf so I suppose you can use that as your guide."
Brogress,278lg9,broesb4hoes,1 point,Thu Jun 5 01:32:08 2014 UTC,"You need not cut, you need to gain muscle first. Eat at 500cal+ daily over TDEE and workout hard, find a program and stick to it. Incorporate low reps with high reps, and stick to that for at least a year.   You look very similar in the two pictures considering you lost 20lbs. You now look somewhat skinnyfat. In order to cut properly, you need muscle underneath. Work at it! It's a good start brosif."
Brogress,278lg9,mokarney,1 point,Thu Jun 5 06:46:38 2014 UTC,"6 months is a long time for a cut, I'd say take a maintenance break for a few weeks before you wear your body out."

Brogress,272ewq,GiantCrazyOctopus,4,Mon Jun 2 14:38:12 2014 UTC,Just doing a back-of-the-envelope calculation here based on his physique (I'm assuming he did a linear progression):   With an average of 1.5 OHP days a week times 52 weeks times 2.5 years (adding one Pomeranian per workout) it comes out to around 195 Pomeranians. Pretty impressive.

Brogress,26xfkq,FanofPawl,2,Sun Jun 1 03:06:49 2014 UTC,I trained her. Completely IIFYM (if it fits your macros) diet with 4 heavy lifting days and 4 days of cardio.
Brogress,26xfkq,Thmaxify,1 point,Sat May 31 17:37:39 2014 UTC,That was her choice. She does absolutely none now haha!
Brogress,26xfkq,Thmaxify,5,Thu Jul 10 17:08:56 2014 UTC,"You guys forget that this is competition leanness and yes girls look better with more fat on them but that's not the point of the competition. She's going to look even better when she's bulking. Btw, checked your instagram, those are some hella heavy pulls ;)."
Brogress,26xfkq,Thmaxify,2,Thu Jul 10 17:31:43 2014 UTC,"haha thank you :) I'd rather be strong than skinny any day. So yes, you're right, I will be bulking now!"
Brogress,26xfkq,doctorslacker,3,Mon Jun 2 10:04:33 2014 UTC,"Ah yes I forgot to ask you. How long have you been lifting? Because I've seen plenty of girls in the gym who aren't able to bench press more than 70-80 pounds, sometimes not even the bar. It seems to me that a woman's upperbody strength is always so low compared to their lower body strength, or is it just because they don't train their chest/back properly? Your bench press is really impressive compared to most girls."
Brogress,26xfkq,armed_aperture,3,Mon Jun 2 14:56:49 2014 UTC,"Thank you! I've always been active (swimmer and water polo player) but I never actually benched or lifted much until October of last year so it has been about 9 months now. For some funky reason I have an incredibly strong upper body. I am assuming this is because I played polo which is a very upper body dominant sport. Swimming helped me build an amazing endurance as well which has helped me tremendously in my training. For the most part, I think a lot of girls are scared to lift heavy. I can't wait to see what I will be able to accomplish in a few more months! To put in in perspective.. in january the heaviest I could bench was 105lbs, now I am at 145lbs"
Brogress,26xfkq,anotherapostrophe,2,Tue Jun 3 07:57:21 2014 UTC,"Haha impressive! Yeah you're right about girls not wanting to lift heavy, they think they're going to look like Arnold after lifting for a day :D"
Brogress,26xfkq,destructo1337,7,Tue Jun 3 12:10:16 2014 UTC,Isn't it interesting that even in this sub a third of the comments are about your attractiveness rather than your gains. Congratulations on all your hard work. You've made a lot of progress in a very short period of time!

Brogress,26xfkq,asunderco,7,Sat May 31 14:49:26 2014 UTC,"You do realise that 'toned' and 'hard body' are only possible because of muscle, don't you? What you apparently don't like is extremely lean women, so you do like a little bit of fat."
Brogress,26xfkq,luigitheturtle,3,Sat May 31 09:05:09 2014 UTC,"She weighs 122 pounds. She's not muscular. She's fit, and in competition shape in those pictures."

Brogress,26vnjw,xenzor,3,Sat May 31 01:33:03 2014 UTC,"Because of a lack of time I don't go to the gym. Instead I have some dumbbells that I use to exercise. Started out in may of 2013 with no clue about how to train. I only knew how to do situps and curls. Started improvising with my dumbbells in the summer, but I only had 2x10kg/22lbs to work with. Eventually upgraded to 2x15kg/33lbs which is what I still use. I've always wanted to make time to go to a gym, but it has been difficult to find time for that and with the dumbbells I can just start working out whenever I want to. I also started to up my daily dose of protein in september and paid more attention to what to eat in general.  10 months progress picture was taken in march of 2014, 12 months progress picture was taken 3 weeks ago. I've been taking creatine since april and BCAAs starting 3 weeks ago. 12 months-pic only shows bicep flexed because that's probably what I had trained that day. Arm-contour is at 40cm/15.7"".  10 months-pic is the only one where I'm not flexing anything.   Also my legs are far behind, I'm trying to get them up to speed, but it's hard doing that with only a couple of dumbbells."
Brogress,26vnjw,NewLineCinema,3,Fri May 30 15:15:27 2014 UTC,Great progress  Why don't you have time?  You could do a 3 day a week 5x5 or 3x5 program instead of working out 5 out of 7 days.  You should bulk up more - 156 at 5'11 is very slim.
Brogress,26vnjw,pleasecallmebigpapa,2,Fri May 30 16:14:30 2014 UTC,"I have a lot of classes which fill up my schedule, so I often have to train past 10 pm which is unfortunately after closing hours for the local gyms. I'd love to do high weight/low rep exercises more, but I'm limited by the weights that I currently own. I should really buy some more.  Also I've tried bulking, I eat like a mad man, but it just isn't happening. I've always been really slim (as you can see in the first and all other pictures) and because of acne I don't eat any artificial sugars. I think that's a big reason as to why I'm not gaining any weight."
Brogress,26vnjw,NewLineCinema,7,Fri May 30 16:53:57 2014 UTC,You have to count your calories. Chances are you aren't eating as much as you believe.
Brogress,26vnjw,thetravelers,1 point,Fri May 30 16:57:48 2014 UTC,"You're probably right. I'm at about 2600-2800 calories a day, but that might not be enough just yet."
Brogress,26vnjw,thetravelers,2,Fri May 30 17:10:55 2014 UTC,"I had a hard time bulking too.  Before this year my max weight was 186.  I bulked up to 202 a couple months ago and I've recently cut down to 185 for the summer.  I started eating 80 grams of peanuts a day - 40 in the morning, 40 at night.  In addition, I started eating a lot more rice with my meals.  The two combined help me push the scale to 200+ pounds or 90+ kilograms."
Brogress,26vnjw,StoicKnob,1 point,Fri May 30 17:07:47 2014 UTC,Good to know. I'll have to start a peanut-supply.

Brogress,26v0ua,Muscle-UpVote,8,Fri May 30 09:00:24 2014 UTC,"Awesome progress.  It's kind of crazy how complacent one can get with feeling shitty, glad you changed it around!  Just a little critique if you don't mind, your back and shoulders look solid, but your traps are lacking.  If you hit those up for a bit with some shrugs and deads, I think'd you'd look even better.  Just my 2-cents! Keep it up!"
Brogress,26v0ua,PseudotritonRuber,3,Fri May 30 15:07:30 2014 UTC,"Thanks!  Yeah my traps are lacking, will be doing deadlifts at least once a week now. hard to build up solid traps though as I hardly ever used to train them and my shoulders are pretty wide in general, so there is a fair bit of space to fill - once they do fill in though they will be glorious :P"
Brogress,26v0ua,spacetug,1 point,Fri May 30 15:19:57 2014 UTC,"When you're working out at home, you can hang upside down from a pullup bar and do shrugs that way with your bodyweight. Definitely train them more than once a week, and with more than just deadlifts."
Brogress,26v0ua,taureanc,1 point,Fri May 30 15:51:35 2014 UTC,I hadn't thought of that exercise - real easy for me to mix in with my bar weights - will try it out thanks :)

Brogress,26v0ua,Deivae,3,Sat May 31 10:25:23 2014 UTC,Looks great man! The only thing I would say to work on a little bit more is your traps. Big traps can really make you look jacked and allow your shoulders to look more balanced with the rest of your body.
Brogress,26v0ua,Fucter,1 point,Mon Jun 2 00:21:43 2014 UTC,"Thanks :) yeah I agree with you, have now found some trap specific bar exercises and hitting them hard in the gym now. Will hopefully see a good change when I hit 80kg and do a progress then."
Brogress,26v0ua,sitedenich,2,Mon Jun 2 09:12:13 2014 UTC,"This must be the best post I have seen in Brogress, really nice job and congratulations.  Just one question, right now Im 70kg at 1.85m and I feel pretty skinny, do you recomend taking mass gainers or just protein shake? Of course also eating more."
Brogress,26v0ua,sitedenich,2,Sun Jun 1 01:28:30 2014 UTC,":) Thanks!   I think the most important thing to do is to calculate your TDEE then add atleast 500 calories on top of that amount.   I would recommend XL nutrition That works out at just over 50pence per 450 calorie drink - which is the best I could find - plus the carbs in this drink are not just all sugars because it is an oat based powder.  I am convinced it was adding the GOMAD diet to all of the suppliments I took that really packed on the pounds though, I still am drinking 1/2 Gallon of milk a day and I feel like it just ensures growth. I look out for too much fat growth and when I feel like I am getting too much on the abs, I just cut back the milk a little bit :)  But you have to train hard whilst you eat this much or you will just get a bit chubby! :) good luck! :)"

As for diet it's pretty bland, home made calorie shakes that consist of a oats,peanut butter,raw eggs, banana and whey protein for over 1000 cals. Lots of chicken/tuna and rice that's about it haha. For veggies I only really ate spinach and would have broccoli sometimes. I'd usually have cottage cheese before bed too. 3000-3500 cals a day, I counted cals in the beginning, but don't anymore as I just guess in my head lol"

First bring your elbows down and contract the lats, then bring the elbows up and a bit forward to spread the lats. Keep your chest up and as big as you can. And then you have to pose with your legs too, just find a video man, haha"
Brogress,26s6dg,carnitasburritoking,3,Sat May 31 00:23:28 2014 UTC,"Honest question - on the pic on your left it looks like you're not flexing your lats, but on the right you are? Did you build up your back this much in 6 weeks, was that your focus?   Either way you look bigger and look solid. Nice work."
Brogress,26s6dg,carnitasburritoking,3,Sat May 31 16:54:13 2014 UTC,"My lats did grow significantly, but I also didn't know how to pose in the first picture so that emphasized te changes as well"
Brogress,26s6dg,obadetona,1 point,Thu May 29 13:56:35 2014 UTC,Ok cool. Was your back the primary focus of the 6 week block?
Brogress,26s6dg,timmyfinnegan,2,Thu May 29 14:09:26 2014 UTC,"Not at all, I was focused on making my whole body bigger and stronger, but it's like the lats were just begging to grow haha"
Brogress,26s6dg,MmmOnions,3,Thu May 29 14:25:01 2014 UTC,"Awesome. Seems like when you give your body the opportunity to grow (diet, sleep, appropriate workout) then the weaker areas grow faster. Nice work."
Brogress,26s6dg,MmmOnions,2,Thu May 29 15:06:48 2014 UTC,routine? great progress mate
Brogress,26s6dg,xxxamazexxx,2,Thu May 29 15:11:00 2014 UTC,"Honestly I was on a tight budget at this time so I ate a lot of PB&J. My main meals consisted of pasta. As far as routine goes I did a standard Day 1: Back and bis Day 2: chest, shoulders, and tris and Day 3: legs. I did abs in between each day too and slipped in some strongman lifts too. I started each workout with a powerlifting movement like Day 1:heavy deadlifts Day 2: heavy bench or military press and Day 3: deep and wavy squats, then proceeded to heavy sets of 6-12 with bodybuilding movements. But it didn't matter as much of what I did, but how I did. High intensity and highly focused reps. Hope this helped, let me know if you have any more questions :)"
Brogress,26s6dg,Thmaxify,3,Thu May 29 13:38:28 2014 UTC,What was your main source of protein there? The peanut butter?
Brogress,26s6dg,broscientologist,6,Thu May 29 14:11:01 2014 UTC,"Sorry, my pasta included usually lean hamburger or chicken breast, which was the majority of my protein. I also had eggs in the morning and usually two servings of Gold Standard protein every day. And yes, also that sweet sweet PB :)"
Brogress,26shic,fun_ghoul2,2,Thu May 29 15:05:09 2014 UTC,"Cut ended 11/01/13 and from there I started bulking.  The after picture is actually at 185 lbs, sorry for the mistake.  Workout schedule was Upper/Lower/Upper/Lower/Off and repeat.  Reverse dieted from 1800 calories (at the end of my cut) to 3500 calories at the peak of my bulk. I injured my wrist in the beginning of February and had to take a couple of months off so I fell off the wagon and got fat.  Hoping to get back to where I was in January and go from there."
Brogress,26shic,Thatmadrabbit,2,Thu May 29 15:15:43 2014 UTC,Nice progress! Your traps and delta look great!
Brogress,26qb86,djg22,3,Wed May 28 21:17:31 2014 UTC,Great progress! Beautiful bike..
Brogress,26qb86,Ksong11,2,Thu May 29 04:06:01 2014 UTC,"Good progress man, did you do much oblique work during this? You seem to fill out your waist real well between the two pics, or is that just from loosing fat from the hips?"
Brogress,26qb86,MasterMcCloud,2,Thu May 29 02:06:23 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the support!   Not much oblique work. My typical ab workout consists of: heavy rope pulldowns, weighted hanging leg raises OR decline reverse crunches, lots of broomstick twists (is that the correct name?)  I think the waist filling out is combination of losing the weight and doing consistent ab work."
Brogress,26qb86,CraftyMuthafucka,2,Thu May 29 02:21:15 2014 UTC,Great development in the legs.  Impressive for only 3 months.
Brogress,26qb86,Tomi_Sci,2,Thu May 29 03:41:35 2014 UTC,We can see a bit of Bikeporn on the left haha :) How do you incorporate cycling into your lifting routine? I find it really hard to improve in both.
Brogress,26qb86,tehpr0lol,2,Thu May 29 12:39:18 2014 UTC,"During the cutting phase it was easy to incorporate since the extra cardio allowed me to eat a reasonable amount of food. However, as I'm currently bulking, it is extremely difficult to incorporate cycling into my routine. I find on cycling days I need to up my calories by an additional 500 to 1000 to counteract the effort. But yea, I haven't cycled very much this year and don't plan on it sadly. Will save it for next year when I finish my bulk and am looking to cut again :)"
Brogress,26qb86,slavabez,1 point,Thu May 29 12:42:29 2014 UTC,Good to see you're not skipping leg day!
Brogress,26qb86,slavabez,1 point,Thu May 29 10:27:46 2014 UTC,Thank you! Its actually my favourite bodypart to train now!

Brogress,26qb86,KarmaFeedsMyFamily,2,Thu May 29 10:46:35 2014 UTC,Thank you!  My routine is a high volume variation of the Max OT training by Jeff Willet & Paul Delia. Consists of a 5 day split with progressive overload on major compound lifts in the 4-6 rep range. Other accessory movements are 8-12.
Brogress,26p4zv,PunksPrettyMuchDead,8,Wed May 28 14:34:34 2014 UTC,"Very nice job, man.  As a 44 year old Father of two (married, not single) just now starting my progress, I agree on it being nice to see some folks aged 30 and above doing well.  Inspiring.  Also, just being a married parent has given me a ton of respect for single parents.  It would push me to the brink to do this solo.  Way to take care of yourself so you can take care of your cute little one.  As they say, you have to put the oxygen mask on your own face before you assist others.  Again, well done, thanks for posting."
Brogress,26p4zv,OKComputer2012,2,Wed May 28 17:47:35 2014 UTC,I alway say if somebody wants something bad enough they'll get it. I've just been lucky enough to find the thing that drives me.
Brogress,26p4zv,MakesMyPantsTight,18,Thu May 29 00:58:20 2014 UTC,"Preface:  Yes, I probably could have made more gains in a year. There was a few months last fall where I had 35 minutes to get in, lift, and get out until I could find a sitter in the morning. This isn't about maxing maximal progress, it's about not making excuses (I'm too busy! Healthy food is too expensive!) and getting up earlier, working harder, staying up later, and getting shit done.    There's always 18 year olds posting their progress, and it's great and you dudes look awesome, but shit dudes, you're teenage males, and you're practically swimming in testosterone! Us older dudes can do it too, it just takes a little longer.  Started - 170lbs, cut to 153 (Until September), bulk to 190 (Until March 31), cut to 172, net +2 lbs. Still cutting, will be done by the end of June, I hope. I miss pizza.  The before and after goodness!  Edit: Leg photos per request:  Sorry, my kids' room is a mess, but it's the only full-length mirror.  Calf shot 1  Calf shot 2  I tell people that the weight on the scale is just one way of tracking your progress, and don't get hung up on it, and that's why. I'm basically at the same weight as when I started.    1 RM's:  Bench - 115 to 205  Squat - 135 to 245  Deadlift - 135 to 345  Combined big 3 - 385 lbs to 795 lbs    Started on Starting Strength on the first cut, switched to Push/Pull/Legs when I started a bulk, on my own plan right now.  Mon - Chest/Back for strength (Heavy weights, low reps, compound lifts)  Tue - Legs (Heavy weights, low reps)  Wed - Shoulders/Arms - Overhead presses, upright rows, face pulls. Weighted chin ups and close-hand bench.  Thurs - Chest/Back volume - dumb bell bench, rows, lots of pull ups, cable flyes, also triceps pushdowns and pushups. Farmer carries.  Fri - Shoulders/Arms volume - forward and lateral raises, either dumb bell or cables, until my arms want to leave me and never come back. 21's for the biceps, with a drop set finisher.  If I go to the gym on the weekend, it's another legs day, or I'll go hiking or help move shit around my parent's ranch.    Routine:  I try to keep things varied and interesting, so I alternate between 5x5 sets and pyramids on heavy days. Light days are a lot of dumb bell and cable work. Started adding some machine exercises this year to get some of my muscles caught up. The gym's a lot of fun for me, so I always end up doing little sets of pull ups or push ups on the wrong days (It's a playground!), and I just do core work at the end of my workout when I have time. Normally it's cable curls, cable work for my obliques, but lately I've been doing hanging windshield wipers since I'm 18 pounds lighter than my max weight. My lower back muscles get their work on legs day.  As long as my maxes keep creeping up while I'm on a bulk, I feel pretty good about it. Lifts are steady on my cut, I can't wait until I can start progressing them again.    Diet:  Lots of chicken, rice, broccoli, frozen peas whether I'm cutting or bulking. Protein smoothies with tons of eggs, yogurt, and whole milk on a bulk, protein powder in almond milk on a cut. Breakfast is still a couple of eggs and some oats, occasionally bacon, too. I'm not doing any strict low-carb stuff, just making sure I get plenty of protein and fat, and hit my daily calorie goal (2200 right now, but I'll do 2500 without feeling too guilty every now and then. 90/10 rule).   I eat EVERYTHING on a bulk. Hit my protein, and then it's just fat/carb city up to 3500 calories. Pizza, burgers, a dozen eggs, containers of yogurt with almonds, 1/2 gallon of milk a day, I just go NUTS. I miss it. :'(   Edit for Lifestyle:  Some criticism leveled at me (Some better worded than others) on my progress. Between two kids, working full time, and college, there are some serious time constraints that I have to work around. Yeah, my lifts could be higher, but we work with the time we've got, and as long as we're better than we were the day before, that's not mediocrity.    The future:  Keep eating, lifting, and growing! I'm going to finish my cut in July, then do a short bulk/cut cycle to compete in a physique show in November. If you're in AZ it's going to be in Tucson, feel free to come out, I'll walk around in my /r/fitness tank.  I'm getting my NASM cert in June. After having my trauma medicine career sidetracked after getting out of the Army, it's great to find something else I can be really passionate about.  No PEDs, but it's a step I'm considering taking after 2014 is over.     Bonus pic: My son picking up his balcony log. You have to remember you're not just lifting for you, but to help inspire those around you!"

Brogress,26p4zv,down_vote_city__,2,Thu May 29 01:00:04 2014 UTC,How do you schedule your workouts?  Early AM before work?  At a local gym??
Brogress,26p4zv,cpierse,2,Wed May 28 15:40:55 2014 UTC,"Yep, between my kids going on the bus or sitter and work. Even if your time is limited, just GO. A short workout is better than no workout. For a while I was only able to do 35 minutes a day, I just got in, lifted as heavy as I safely could with short rests, and just did a circuit of big lifts.  I've got 90 minutes now with a sitter in the morning, so I take my time, am more methodical, and take 10 minutes at the end for tanning."
Brogress,26p4zv,wuckfork,2,Wed May 28 17:25:35 2014 UTC,"Also, yes, I go to a local gym called Bodyworks. They've got a great weight room, 3 benches, 2 squat racks, and they're okay with dead lifting, being noisy, and when I get my trainer cert (12 more days!!!) I'll probably end up training there."

Brogress,26nsvu,TruKiller,2,Wed May 28 03:58:38 2014 UTC,"I'm not the most scientific or methodical person about my workouts. I began with Starting Strength, and sort of just evolved it from there. also don't know the names of a lot of exercises, haha.  That said, I have a semi-solid routine.   I pretty much do the typical exercises - exactly what you'd expect: Curls, pull ups, chin ups, reverse curls, bench, incline bench, shoulder press, squats, leg press, DEADLIFT, clean, that power clean, crunches, bicycle crunches, batwings.   Then the other stuff is mostly like holding a weight in one or both arms and dipping your torso several times, holding plates in positions to strengthen your core- stuff I don't know the names of. Also combining exercises.   I divide the week into groups, of course.  Biceps / Triceps Chest / Biceps Shoulders / Triceps Back  Legs Abs every day, with one focus day.  Repeat and modulate.   I tend to lift 5 days a week. I also bike a lot.   Diet- Not surprisingly, I'm also not the most fastidious about my diet. It's a bit of a struggle for me to gain weight. I try to eat four meals a day- a lot of baked chicken, eggs, unflavored yogurt, peanut butter, beans. I eat a lot of vegetables - broccoli, kale, romaine, spinach, cauliflower, peppers, lentils, and fruit. On days when I workout, I end up taking about 80grams of whey protein.  I'm proceeding at a medium pace and we're all gonna make it brahs."

Your abs are likely already there just waiting to be chiseled out of your belly, and if not then deadlifts and squats will be plenty to build them, and do much more for you to get built than the Ab Wheel."

I was at like 240x5 for 5 sets  Bench: 175x5 for 5 sets, still increasing slowly  DL: 315x5, grip is starting to fuck me, probably gonna reset soon  OHP: 115x5 for 5 sets, I think I could probably do 125x5 I but had an injured shoulder last fall so I'm increasing the weight reallllly slowly"
Brogress,266v8g,dizzyfingerz3525,1 point,Thu May 22 22:05:04 2014 UTC,"Great progress. After wasting a lot of time on a split and not eating enough, I made my best gains ever on ICF 5x5 over about the same amount of time.  What did you tweak about the program? One thing I did was ""sevens"" for biceps instead of regular curls. I also never liked doing rows on both days - I preferred to go heavy on them on just one of the days."
Brogress,266v8g,IwantPuppies,1 point,Fri May 23 04:48:59 2014 UTC,"Thanks! I added a lot more arm volume and by ""sevens"" do you mean 21s (7 lower half reps, 7 upper, 7 full)? Because I added those a few weeks ago too and I love them. They give me crazy pumps. I also added some more shoulder work and made a bunch of other minor changes every once in a while. What did you move on to after ICF 5x5?"
Brogress,266v8g,BabyCheezits,1 point,Mon May 26 02:58:25 2014 UTC,"Yes, that's what I meant by sevens.  After ICF, I moved on to Lean Gains and RPT style training. I'm about at the end of my cut though, so I'm thinking of returning to ICF to milk the last bit of linear progress, or potentially PHAT over the summer."

Brogress,2665h0,Ganja_Rick,1 point,Thu May 22 03:30:53 2014 UTC,haha thanks
Brogress,2665h0,Ganja_Rick,5,Thu May 22 13:27:39 2014 UTC,Awesome job man! Can I ask what your routine has been?
Brogress,2665h0,aileme,4,Thu May 22 04:11:26 2014 UTC,"Thanks man. Didn't really have a routine because during this period I had a few little problems (unpredictable schedule, etc). No cardio as I used a pair of crutches for walking also. But I could give you other pointers.  I am trying to keep it under 30g of carbs per day. Keep well hydrated, this is very important. Eat high protein, I don't think I need to mention this but anyway. Help your body with creatine if you feel you need it. Low carbs will make you tired so creatine will help. If you really want this fast, go keto, but for me that is just too much (takes away my drive for other things because I feel too tired). Stick to a diet plan and whatever happens don't cheat.  Find a routine that fits you, I lift 5 days/week, 2 days rest. Start the week with whatever you think is harder (ex. back). You will want to end the week with something easier because you will be tired. Don't be lazy, set your routine for the day and follow it to the letter.   PUSH-UPS EVERYDAY!!! I can not stress this enough. I started this as a joke but I was amazed after two weeks. My dad challenged me to 100 push-ups and obviously I failed after 40. So I set a goal of 300 push-ups/day in sets of 50. Any time during the day just do 50 push-ups and go on with your day. As you grow stronger you can increase the daily number and also increase your sets. Currently I am doing 500 push-ups/day in sets of 70. You will see improvements in 2 weeks. Do not cheat, do as many as you can in a set, as correctly as you can. Plan your sets not to be easy, but to be challenging, you want to feel some pain in the last 15 reps or so. This was probably my only constant routine, and honestly I am impressed with the efficiency of this.   Don't cheat the diet, never stop the lifting whatever happens and do your push-ups. Be patient, every body evolves differently, give it time and only think about tomorrow, ""how can you be stronger, better tomorrow"". Take it one day at a time and you will see the results.   Do not stop, refuse to stop whatever happens. You will have days even weeks of feeling shit, tired, ""this is not working as I expect it"". All of this is your weak mind, you just have to be patient. Don't stop seriously, this will be one of the best things in your life, it has so many implications it is absolutely impossible to find a way to explain all of them, just don't stop and see for your self, it's worth it.   Best of luck."
Brogress,2665h0,milkman182,2,Thu May 22 13:27:06 2014 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the advice man. This really motivates me to see someone start with a similar body type as mine make such a change. Much appreciated, thanks."
Brogress,2665h0,BroomSIR,1 point,Thu May 22 15:04:39 2014 UTC,I admire what you achieved but really dislike the push-up challenge.. Following /r/bodyweightfitness push-ups in high counts only raise your muscle endurance and not really strenght
Brogress,2665h0,badabingbadabang,3,Sat May 24 16:05:36 2014 UTC,yeah i'd like to know as well
Brogress,2665h0,thenameisA,2,Thu May 22 05:01:34 2014 UTC,+1   I started a few inches taller and a few lbs heavier than OP so would be handy for me.

Brogress,265juw,OhShitItsWayneBrady,4,Wed May 21 21:22:00 2014 UTC,"Background: I worked out a little in high school, but never had any results to show except for abs from hundreds of daily sit ups. So I was just a skinny guy with abs for a while. My roommates really got my into lifting my sophmore year of college. However, I made hardly any progress for my first two years. Not until about a year and a half ago did I realize just how important eating a caloric surplus is for gaining weight, strength, and mass. Thanks /r/gainit. Diet really is everything.  My routine for about the past eight months has been the following: bis/tris, lats/middle back, lower back/hamstrings/calves, shoulders/abs, quads/calves, chest/abs, rest. My diet generally consists of chicken, lean ground beef, turkey burgers, whole eggs, nuts, broccoli, bananas, protein bars, whole grain buns, whole grain/wheat tortillas, whole grain pasta, brown rice, universal's gainer protein, and musclepharm's protein before bed."

If you're losing the treasure trail, make the most of what you've got!"
Brogress,264mz9,nemamook,2,Wed May 21 20:47:41 2014 UTC,"Nicely done, you can see improvement in the shoulders, back and chest, with just a hint of relaxed abs showing through.  Props for recreating lighting conditions pretty accurately.  You might look into low-rise boxer briefs, it'll help show off your Apollo's Belt (or whatever you elect to call the groove/line/things on your waist) better."
Brogress,264mz9,Furrito,2,Wed May 21 18:27:53 2014 UTC,Cheers! Thanks for the non trolling comment and advice. :) the difference in lighting came courtesy of upgrading my phone. 4 months down 20 more to go.

Brogress,264mz9,pleasecallmebigpapa,1 point,Wed May 21 20:48:48 2014 UTC,"I'm doing RPT 3 times a week with a standard upper/lower split hitting all the compounds properly. No ego lifting, no high volume, no cardio.   Diet has been a +1750 calorie/wk surplus putting me up to .5 lbs/week. My trendweight I've been carb cycling following /r/Leangains or leangains.com. Seriously read that whole website. I've been intermittent fasting my whole life and didn't know it. Martin Berkhan is a very giving person in the fitness community.   The best advice I can give with my limited experience is:   Just stick with it. No matter what it is you're doing, consistency rules all.   Diet really is 80% of your goals.  Track everything - lifts, calories, weight, mood, everything.    Resources that have helped me:   LgMacros.com  Road to Ripped Podcast - Great guys, great guests, great information.

First 3 Months:Exercise 5 days a week. Firstly I ran for at least 30 mins and then after was weight training for another 30-60 mins. Did 2x10 for multiple different exercises, bench press, bicep curls, lat pull down, a bunch of random stuff. Eventually made a routine from it. Had very little idea what I was doing. Diet was shit, limited myself to 1500 calories a day. Ate anything I wanted as long as it was 1500. Although I did drop the weight super fast it was not smart.  3-5 Months: Started doing different exercises and devolping different routines. Still running 5 days a week but now it would be for about 1 hour of running. Bumped up my calories to around 2500 but stopped counting on myfitnesspal and did it all in my head (bad idea). Still ate like shit, didn't count macros or anything.  4th Month: Hit my goal weight of 180 lbs(and my plateau weight). Was stuck here till 5th month.  5th month:Desperate to loose more weight I decided to give keto a try. Stuck with that for 2 months. Developed a good lifting routine as well. running was now Monday,Wednesday and Friday for 6 miles each run.  7th Month: weight was 174lbs but wanted more. Stopped doing keto and took a fat burner stack from Complete Nutrition store near me.   Now: At 170lbs pounds. Finished the fat burner stack. Routine is Monday, Wednesday, and Friday is start off with 6 mile run. Then Mondays and Thursdays are Chest and back. Tuesdays and Fridays are Bi's and Tri's. Wednesdays and Saturdays are Legs and Shoulders.  Diet: ~2500 calories, 220p,220c,83f."

Brogress,25ynki,katek8kate,65,Mon May 19 18:44:38 2014 UTC,Pics like this make me confused as to why everyone doesn't lift. Why wouldn't you want to look that good?

Brogress,25ynki,renewedhope,4,Tue May 20 13:53:21 2014 UTC,What form of psychotherapy were you prescribed to?
Brogress,25ynki,mkay0,9,Tue May 20 14:06:11 2014 UTC,"I do CBT, CAT, some anger management therapy I can't remember the name of, and compassionate minds therapy."
Brogress,25ynki,baddentist,10,Tue May 20 15:00:44 2014 UTC,"Uh, cause it's fucking hard."
Brogress,25ynki,byAnarchy,6,Tue May 20 03:43:24 2014 UTC,"Is it that hard? I know everyone on r/fitness likes to talk up the incredible difficulty of lifting, but compared to reaching a comparable level of fitness at a cardiovascular-intensive sport, it's not that hard or painful.  Basically, I think lifting heavy is an awesome activity that we shouldn't scare people away from with macho talk of difficulty (which is often for our own egos)."
Brogress,25ynki,mkay0,-7,Wed May 21 01:45:49 2014 UTC,Yeah that's bullshit.
Brogress,25ynki,strongjz,15,Tue May 20 04:15:46 2014 UTC,"Losing 80 lbs and transforming her body like OP did, yeah, it's fucking hard. She must have worked her ass off."
Brogress,25ynki,IntellegentIdiot,20,Tue May 20 04:18:01 2014 UTC,"I have to agree with you - it is hard. Mentally, it's difficult to convince yourself in the heat of the moment that the fast food isn't really worth it. I have literally cried over wanting to keep eating the whole bucket of ice cream and making myself stop at a serving. Lifting heavy weight is incredibly physically taxing. Hell, even light jogging is fucking tough when you're out of shape. The good news is, once you suffer through making the transition, it becomes a hell of a lot easier. Sure, it's still physically tough, but I'm used to it. I've learned to like it. I'm used to healthy foods and actually crave things like strawberries instead of things like fried chicken. It gets better."
Brogress,25ynki,byAnarchy,6,Tue May 20 04:45:35 2014 UTC,This shit right here is what everybody needs to learn.
Brogress,25ynki,mkay0,3,Tue May 20 13:54:33 2014 UTC,"She did it in a year, though. It's a lot easier to do it in two years or longer. What matters is eating right and doing the exercise, which is inconvenient but not hard"
Brogress,25ynki,byAnarchy,-14,Sat May 24 15:02:45 2014 UTC,"Yeah, of course she worked her ass off. But that doesn't mean it was hard. She was dedicated for one a whole year and I hope she continues to pursue this lifestyle if she likes it. But by no means is it hard.  Stop eating so much fucking food and get off your lazy ass once in a while and you'll lose weight. It's really simple, to be honest."
Brogress,25ynki,ShitsCrazyMan,14,Tue May 20 04:29:23 2014 UTC,"I think you are confusing the words hard and complicated. It's not complicated, just eat right and excercuse, but it's actually very hard to change your life. Changing your habits is hard. Finding time to exercise when you never did before is hard. Eating right when you have bad habits is hard.   Why would we have an entire subreddit dedicated to showing us pics of people who paid the price and made an improvement? If it's so easy, why do we have anyone out of shape? It takes real work, and the discipline to stick to it. It's hard."
Brogress,25ynki,sesquipedalian22,4,Tue May 20 04:45:09 2014 UTC,"Ah, it appears I have mixed them up. Thanks for pointing that out.  However, I still find that lifting and eating properly is one of the easier things in my life. I have so many terrible habits and a severe lack of discipline in many areas of my life, but not staying healthy.  What gives?"

Brogress,25ynki,gagafit,11,Mon May 19 19:24:40 2014 UTC,"My current diet is around 2000 cal/day, with approximate macros of 50C/30F/20P. Non-lifting days are closer to 1850, lifting days closer to 2250. Mostly healthy, well-balanced meals including most or every food group, and dessert every night. My routine is normally Strong Curves, but at the moment I'm visiting my parents for a few months and only have access to their dinky machine-only gym for old people. I'm making it work anyway."

Brogress,25pc6v,public-masturbator,4,Fri May 16 17:23:28 2014 UTC,"However, by squatting while fat, you get to keep the ""fatkid calves"" :D They are awesome, and hard to build back once you loose the muscle mass from your legs which was supposed to hold the extra weight. I would rather recommend -at first not whole- bodyweight squats, because running while heavy will put enormous stress on your knees, and prior squatting strengthens the joint and the tendons.   Your progress is unbelievable by the way, great work! I wish I could have done something like this in 18 months :O"

I was at 320 about 5 months ago, having mild difficulty walking sometimes; and now my weight is fluctuating a couple pounds over or under 280. Mind you, I am 5'11'' - 6'ish.  Don't wait so long to start lifting, you will burn a lot of calories of fat whilst preserving your muscle mass to an extent. The number on the scale might not go down fast, but I assure you that your body will transform at a quicker rate.   Also, doing front squats and low impact cardio--such as an elliptical machine--has done wonders for reducing pain, and increasing range of motion in my legs.   I want you to succeed."

Brogress,25pc6v,swimforce,1 point,Sun May 18 02:13:06 2014 UTC,"Waiting isn't necessarily bad per se. My mode of thought was more along the line that the more you do immediately and consistently, the sooner you will see results, and reach your goals.   I can understand why you would want to start light because a lot of people burn out and stop if they go too hard at the beginning. But, then again, some people can do it and keep the momentum--it's all rooted in how much you want the future results.   EDIT: Also, about the weight training, you don't need to treat that as a more advanced level of working out. If you want to start slow, you can do moderate levels of lifting--I'd say that including a weight session 2 or 3 days a week in your workout routines is an easy start. Then as you get farther along, you can turn that into 4 then 5 sessions per week."
Brogress,25pc6v,rocconyew,1 point,Sun May 18 03:03:24 2014 UTC,"Well, I just meant that it would require me to join a gym. Something I haven't done yet. I'm not sure if I can incur the cost yet.

Brogress,25mutu,jchazu,34,Thu May 15 16:06:51 2014 UTC,"Goals and routine: Since  last May, I spent the summer largely slacking off on both my diet and exercise, and at the beginning of September I was at about 165 lbs without having gone up much on my lifts (I wasn't really thinking about progressing or counting calories, so really I just gained a few lbs without getting much stronger). From there, I conscientiously decided to bulk for the winter, with the plan of cutting in the spring.  So I.  Ate.  Everything.  ""I'm bulking!"" I would exclaim as I shoveled burrito after burrito into my mouth. It was glorious; it was beautiful; it was stupid. Although I was definitely getting enough protein, I wasn't getting nearly enough sleep (I just got into a new relationship), and I wasn't really focused on my strength. So yea, I would go in and lift, but I rarely gave it my all. I would do my thing, and maybe lift a couple extra pounds on every once in a while, but that was about it. And as a result, come January I was up to 183, and I started to realize that I was slowly becoming squishier and squishier (second picture). So then it was dieting time!  Now, when I started cutting, I think I did a few things wrong. Overnight I went from eating everything in sight to eating 2000 cals per day, supplementing with an EC stack. And let me tell you, that weight just fell off me. However, I soon realized that I didn't have nearly as much muscle as I thought I had gained. I don't know if it was because I didn't train hard enough, didn't get enough sleep, or if it was because I cut too hard too fast, but right now I'm sitting at about 166 with an ever-so-slightly higher BF% than when I was at my leanest last May. Overall that's ~9lbs of lean muscle mass gained, which isn't bad I suppose, but I was hoping for a few lbs more. It's also possible that I lost a bunch of water weight, because with less calories came less carbs, and I stopped taking creatine a couple weeks before my cut as well.  Once I saw that I had dropped 12 lbs in a month and a half (down to 171), I decided to try a different approach to dieting, as I still had some tummy fat I wanted to shed. So I decided to try intermittent fasting. I love it. Learning about IF also brought me to learn about BCAAs, and taking them before my early morning fasted workouts plus eating larger meals later in the day have really helped me from feeling overly fatigued at 6 in the morning. I've been doing IF for about 2 months now, and I have lost another 5lbs and have progressed in all my lifts. Just this morning I PR'ed 275 x 2 in my back squat, and it was a great start to my day. =) So in short: train hard, get sleep, gradually ease into bulking/cutting, and skipping breakfast may allow for much more satisfying meals in the PM.  Routine:  I work out three days a week, Tues/Thurs/Sun or Sat. I do full-body workouts, because I enjoy feeling drained and I don't get that feeling when I do split workouts. However, I alternate doing either squats or deadlifts, and those are the only leg exercises I do. My routine was borne out of fuckarounditis. I've switched up a lot of stuff since I started working out: in addition to squats and deadlifts, I've added some cable work, DB shoulder presses, and bicep curls (which, surprisingly, I never used to do out of fear of being a curlbro - then I realized my arms were puny), and I dropped planks and hip thrusts from my routine because they bored me. In my mind, at least, I say that I work out because I want bigger muscles, but I enjoy heavy, low-rep sets, so I figure I'll just take whatever increase in size comes with that.  Last year's lift numbers are in italics.  Warm up: resistance band, stretching, and foam rolling pecs, lats, t-spine, delts, and hip flexors.  One arm DB row:* 85lbs* > 100lbs - 3x8 (though I've recently learned that my form is absolutely horrendous, so this number is going down).  Incline DB Bench Press: 40lbs > 70lbs - 3x5  DB Shoulder Press: 55lbs - 3x5  Roman chair leg raises: BW - 3x12 (one straight-leg raise and one bent-knee raise = one rep)  Back Squats: 225lbs - 3x5 (275 1rm)  Deadlifts: 275ish - 3x3-5 (my deadlift varies a lot depending on my back - 315 1rm)  Alternating one-arm bicep curls: 25lbs > 40 lbs - 2x5, followed by a 35lb set to failure.  Face pulls - 72.5lbs - 3x8  I usually throw in accessory work depending on my mood. Lately it's been a lot of shoulder work. Sometimes I also do some lat pulldowns or cable rows - I try to focus on my back for postural reasons. This is also why I don't do much work on my chest at all, though I think I'm going to change that in the future because I want some nicely-defined man-pecs.  Diet: Whether cutting or bulking, I make sure to get 1 gram of protein per pound of BW. This past bulk season I just ate everything in sight, but this year I'm going to go slow and controlled, in an effort to reduce fat gain. When cutting, I generally shoot for a 500 cal/day deficit, but since I lost weight so quickly, I think I may have underestimated my TDEE (I was guessing around 2500 according to online calculators). Currently with IF I'm eating slightly more on workout days and slightly less on rest days, hoping to come out with a small overall deficit. To trim my belly fat lol. I'm still trying to figure out what my true TDEE is though.  Going forward, I want to work on my arms and chest a bit more, and I might still cut slowly for the next couple weeks to see if I can lower my BF%.

Brogress,25mutu,down_vote_city__,3,Fri May 16 05:27:31 2014 UTC,"My genetics are sooo stacked against me here; my dad was never able to grow his calves and my grandfather on my mother's side had chicken legs too. I didn't have calves when I was a runner/played basketball, they didn't grow when I trained with jumpsoles, they didn't grow when I did shitloads of heavy calf raises. I suppose I should still work them out, but seeing no progress pretty much ever is pretty discouraging. My quads and hams are doing fine, at least, so I'll take what I can get.  Edit: Re-read the post and it looks like I'm making excuses, and I am. I need to work my calves."
Brogress,25mutu,CAESARS_TOSSED_SALAD,2,Fri May 16 05:40:20 2014 UTC,"My calves looked just like yours before I trained them seriously.  In just over 2 years I put 4 inches on my calves.  I think it's worth it to do it, but it's up to you.  You have to train them very seriously though if they're resistant to growth and probably a lot harder than you are currently training them. Try like 10 sets every other day, and make sure you track your progress on them.  I have also found, if you have higher calf inserts, the top part of the motion is extremely important in recruiting the gastrocnemius. If you do not fully squeeze out at the top, it does not fully contract and you will not make gains. I see people making this mistake a lot, lifting too much and not getting a proper contraction at the top if they have higher inserts."

Ive gone up and down 5-15 pounds past few months which pissed me off at several occasions (no ""big change!""), but your change is a perfect example of just how little the scale says about us.  I would sincerely appreciate if you could answer a few questions:  You brought up intermittent fasting, what was your fasting schedule like? When did you eat/workout/fast?  (I am currently cutting @ 1800 calories per day, but im still having a hard time loosing fat, so Ive decided to give that a try, I tried fasting during shorter periods and the results were definitely there)  Once you were counting calories, what were your daily intake of carbs/protein/fats?  I do split workouts, however the simplicity of your workout is giving me second thoughts, how long did your workout take on a typical day?  Full body workouts, 4 times/week, thats the same muscles being worked out every 1-2 days, are you sure you were getting proper rest? Theres quite some fuzz about overtraining and all that too, which forced me to do split workouts.  Thank you in advance sir, keep it up."
Brogress,25mutu,majetuani,3,Fri May 16 01:08:26 2014 UTC,"I pretty much started IF because I had a couple months to kill before my goal ""summer ready"" date, and I had already reached my goal weight. So while I've been doing IF since then, I have NOT been consistent in the amount of calories I'm eating. For a week or two I did 2100 on rest days and 2500 on workout days (my TDEE was ~2500) because I wanted to lose a little more body fat, for a couple weeks I did 2000/3000 because I wanted to recomp, and right now I'm just shooting for around 2500 per day, rest and workout. Once I started seeing my weight fluctuate as low as 163, I started getting concerned that I was losing too much muscle so I decided it was better to maintain, plus since I already more or less have the physique I want for right now and I just generally feel better when I'm not cutting, I figured it'd be best to just maintain for the time being until I'm ready to slow bulk (beginning of July).  I didn't count macros too much while doing IF, basically I would just try to get more carbs on workout days and fats on rest days. For example, on a workout day I would have chili with s slice or two of bread, and on rest days I would sprinkle cheese in my chili instead. Stuff like that.  I would workout fasted at 6am and take BCAAs before. I wish I had known about BCAAs before! I used to do early morning workouts before doing IF, and the BCAAs really do make a difference in my energy levels in the morning. I then usually have two cups of coffee between 9 and 2 (sometimes with creamer, sometimes black), and then would break the fast around 2:30. I stay up late and get the munchies so I wanted to start my fast late. The only times I've broken the timing were Mother's Day and a work cookout. Even though my caloric intake has been all over the place, I still find IF to be awesome just because I eating giant meals and passing out afterwards.  My workout can take anywhere from 45 minutes to double that, depending on how seriously I take my warm-up (I used to always skip it) and how many accessory exercises I do. Sometimes when I'm ""in the zone"" I'll keep lifting just because I enjoy it. Sometimes when I'm not feeling it I bail early.  I usually only work out 3 times a week - I get two days of rest Friday and Saturday, but sometimes it works out to four days one week and two the next or whatever, depending on other obligations I have and gym hours. I do indeed feel like I get enough rest, but ONLY if I actually get proper sleep. If I don't get 7 hours of sleep my lifts go down noticeably. Speaking of which, it's about two in the morning where I am and I have to be up in 5 and a half hours. Whoops!"

Brogress,25nhrv,OmegaZeroth,2,Sat May 17 22:02:48 2014 UTC,When I first started I actually had a friend of mine give me a meal plan for cutting that was a much larger defecate. Around 1800 calories. The first week I lost around 10lbs from loss of waterweight due to so little sodium in my diet. After that week I continued to lose around 2lbs a week. After about a month or so I decided to up my calories cause I was noticing my strength decrease in the gym and I was always tired. After the calorie increase I lost around a pound a week. This is my first cut and I didn't know anything about cutting going into it so initially I just ate what was on the plan my friend gave me and ended up doing research on it while I was cutting. I made some mistakes along the way but I think it turned out alright and now I'm more knowledgeable for next time.

Your body will get heavier on a caloric surplus and lighter on a deficit, you can't selectively add muscle while you burn fat. After a month, it could very well just be glycogen and water adding the extra weight.  Checked your post history, and it looks like you're going to Planet Fitness. If you're looking to actually lift weights, you should be looking for an actual gym.  Suggestion time: It's awesome you're looking to lift weights, but you need to do a little research so you don't end up spinning your wheels and getting frustrated. Head over to /r/fitness, read the FAQ, and figure out what your goals are and eat and lift for those goals."

I'm only raising  concerns because i have a friend who went through the same thing as you, being a ""twig"" to putting on some solid mass by working out and eating basicly everything in his reach (pizza, chocolate, fatty foods). that diet is unsustainable though, since that mass gain will slowly become more fat and less muscle as time progresses.  2 scoops of a decent and cheap gainer is probably 60-70 grams of protein and enough calories to replace that burger and fries."

Right now i'm focusing on eating clean and as much as i can, so i'm not following any strict diet.  Routine: At the beginning i trained what i wanted, was lifting in school the first two years and we only had a small amount of machines. Right now I'm going to the gym about 4 times a week, doing Legday on Sunday, Chest/Back on two days, it varies in strength and volume and arms/shoulders and neck on the other day  Motivation: At the beginning my friends kept me going, they also lifted in school, right now its my new workout partner and i really like to watch Motivation Videos on YT, there are quite a few that I really like. But of course the biggest motivation is my progress i went through, never expected these results and it keeps me motivated"

Admittedly it was at a weird angle, but they're pretty disproportionate to your arms.  The complete lack of chest or core growth just makes your giant arms look weird. I mean outside of losing some fat around your stomach, your torso in your after picture is largely the same as your before picture. Is that not weird considering your arms are 3 times the size as they were before?  You're just not very proportionate.   I'm just a random internet stranger though, go compete and see what happens."

I see no abs, possibly no legs (no picture, so who knows?) and really just massive biceps/traps. Close friend has traps just as big after his shoulder ets, and is natty. Of course, he's been at it for 5+ years, but if this guy has been focusing on JUST those things (which imma give him the benefit of the doubt for) I think it'd be possible. If he comes thru with a leg shot and a back shot and show the same amount of MASSIVE size I'd probably assume different - but if they (the legs/back) were as proportional to his arms/traps, why wouldnt he post em?"

Brogress,25adjb,SanchitoQ,1 point,Sun May 11 16:29:07 2014 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the response.  The eating thing has always been tricky for me...I spent the last 12 years managing restaurants/retail food places.  I eat irregularly, and it's never really food where I can measure the calories easily.    It sounds like you've been strictly trying to lose weight (from 230 down to 170), but if I'm wrong, please correct me.  I'm hoping to ultimately land around 180-185, so I'm not necessarily looking to drop a ton of weight.  Ideally I guess it would be small bulk and cut?    Apologize if I'm naive about it, but what do you mean when you say P/P/L program?  I'm also curious how you dealt with wanting to go to the gym more than 3x a week.  I'm in the same boat as you.  This week I lifted M/W/Sat, then did 45 min of cardio this morning.  I can't help but feel like I need to do some kind of cardiovascular stuff at least once a week (even though I know SL 5x5 stresses not to go beyond the confines of the program)."
Brogress,25adjb,tetrajitsu,1 point,Sun May 11 18:06:48 2014 UTC,My squat started to feel hard around 215 ilb. Switching to a low bar position made a huge difference. As long as my squat improves my other lifts do but when I stall on squats seems like everything stalls.

Brogress,257v3r,trevorparsons,2,Sun May 11 15:21:31 2014 UTC,"First things first, are you familiar with your caloric intake? That was the biggest ""a-ha"" moment for me. I started lifting and for awhile saw very little progress. Then I decided to count my calories. I estimated I was around 1800. Turns out I was averaging only around 1400 a day. As soon as I bumped that up to 2200, then 2500, then 2800 it was off to the races with newbie gains!  TDEE (total daily energy expenditure) calculators can help you get started: http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/  This will tell you a close estimate of how many calories your body burns in a given day. The general consensus among /r/gainit is to eat 500 calories above your TDEE for bulking. In a very basic nutshell, the extra calories over your TDEE will be used by your body in the muscle healing/building process (and any further excess unfortunately will get stored as fat). Btw, you have been over to /r/gainit yeah? Great resource for motivation, guidance, and creative high-calorie, high-protein meals/recipes.  Otherwise, I too had a hard time eating enough in the sense that I felt like I was force feeding food down my throat. All I can really say about that is that it gets easier as you go, at least it did for me. As I worked out more (and harder) my body started beckoning me to eat more. Eventually I found myself looking forward to the next meal and often thinking ""What am I going to eat this time?"" Hell, right now I'm on a cut (1800 calories a day) and I'm constantly hungry as can be. Obviously YMMV, but just keep making yourself eat throughout the day. Eating several (6-7) smaller meals a day was a big help for me in the beginning.  Lastly, I'd strongly consider taking creatine. 5g a day (one rounded teaspoon) mixed in with my protein shake is how I take it. And oh, make milk your best friend. I've never gone as extreme as GOMAD (gallon of milk a day) but I do go through a gallon every three days.  EDIT: Forgot to mention the MyFitnessPal app. Great/easy way to track your calories, especially using the bar code scanner!"
Brogress,257v3r,swimforce,1 point,Sun May 11 16:59:20 2014 UTC,Thanks for your well thought out reply. I know I probably eat only about 1600 calories a day. Ill add up my intake tomorrow. My TDEE is 2354.
Brogress,257v3r,hakujin214,-3,Sun May 11 17:15:54 2014 UTC,"Wow! Thanks! That is so nice.   Honestly, I wish I could give you advice, but I just ""play it by ear."" It's sort of like cooking. I don't cook things for 25 minutes and 30 seconds because the instructions on the back of the box say to do so, I just cook it until it looks right. So my advice to you would just be to do what feels right, and after a while eating the right amount and exercising correctly becomes second nature.   Focus on form when you lift, when you're working shoulders, think about your shoulders, think about trying to use them. If you want less baby fat, drink less milk and eat less cheese. Starting Strength says drink a gallon a day but fuck that, you want clean healthy weight, from foods with real sustenance and nutrition, like beans, rice, chicken. Do you know what the paleo diet is? Google it. It is basically eating like a caveman, natural foods. I basically do that, except I eat cheese and milk and bread in very small quantities. It's a pretty awesome diet. I recommend it."
Brogress,257v3r,jackwagon92,2,Sun May 11 18:16:16 2014 UTC,"So what's wrong with milk and cheese? I've never heard of it being connected to ""baby fat""."
Brogress,257v3r,CraftyMuthafucka,6,Sun May 11 20:07:07 2014 UTC,I find it hard to believe you put on 30lb of muscle from doing pushups and rock climbing in 5 months. Most people are lucky to put on 20lbs in a year. I know your pretty tall so its spread out over more area but unless a lot of the weight is fat I doubt that's what you really gained.
Brogress,257v3r,hakujin214,9,Sun May 11 02:52:21 2014 UTC,You think the pictures show 30lbs of muscle gain?
Brogress,257v3r,CHL1,5,Sun May 11 07:12:47 2014 UTC,"I certainly did not put on 30lbs of muscle in 5 months, not even Arnold Schwarz could do that. A lot of it is flab, and just healthy body weight, as you can tell in the picture. If I was 185 lbs of muscle I'd be Hugh Jackman mode. In 7 more months I might look close to that, but not right now."

I go rock climbing a lot too, and that works an array of muscles.   For diet I am just a natural healthy eater and conscientious of what I put in my face. Probably ~3k calories a day. I also drink juice (kale + spinach + pear + carrot) 4x a week because I work at a juice bar. I take multivitamins and fish oil.   I drink a beer or 2 twice a week."

I altered the program to fit my needs and wants and that worked. I also didn't eat the 3,500 or so calories that the program suggests.

Brogress,257b7t,IvyLeagueBro,0,Fri May 16 23:34:30 2014 UTC,"About three years ago the whole concept of paleo just clicked in my brain and I stopped cold turkey with the pizzas, sodas, candy, bread and grains. I even ditched the coffee. I felt great, and about 35 lbs of fat fell off my gut and my ass (having fat asscheeks is never cool as a dude).  However, the lack of proper exercise meant that I was approaching skeleton mode. I was slim but very weak. I had a go at some routines but I saw very little progress and I physically felt pretty horrible after exerting myself. I was quickly discouraged.  Last year, a bit after the before picture, I had another go at it. I started slow with some yoga exercises at home, along with pushup variations and squats. I found an outdoors gym and did dips and chinup negs (couldn't do a single chinup, even with my legs swinging). I really pushed myself during the sets and had long periods of rest between the workouts (4-6 days).  I got stronger, but I didn't really gain any weight, and I was still feeling shitty and dizzy after workouts. After a few months I got over my fear of carbs and started adding rice and potatoes to my dinners. I also started snacking on carrots throughout the day. This made a big, big difference. I felt great during and after workouts, recovery time went down, and I started to steadily gain weight. Today I weighed in at 182 lbs. I'm up to 9 chinups with good form, and about 45 pushups. I've also started doing hill sprints twice a week, and I'm thinking about joining a BJJ class.  I basically follow the paleo diet, but with some added carbs. Lots of eggs, pork, chicken, beef, salmon, rice, potatoes, greens, dark chocolate, olive and coconut oil, tea with heavy cream. I'll have some red wine now and then. Bread and pasta are still out. All simple carbs are out except for some fruits."

Also english is not my native tounge, so please don't mind my spelling too much.    In the first picture, I'm arround 14 yo, and weighing arround 110 pound. As you see, I was a pretty skinny kid. So when I turned 15, I decided to join the local gym. I of course had no clue about anything, and I could not even benchpress the 45 pound bar.  In the next picture I was arround 16. I had been lifting for a few year, and had clearly gotten a bit of muscle on my frame. I also did my very first 100 kg (220 lbs) benchpres ever that year, somthing I was very proud of at the time.  In the ""pretty much naked in front of a car lol"" picture, I was 18 yo.  I did a pretty hard cut, and actually managed to get pretty damn skinny. Looking back at it, I would properly have benefited more form a good long bulk, but at the time I actually felt pretty good about myself. The last picture is about a week old. I am (unfortunatly) the same height in every picture, manlet for life, but hitting puperty and things like that obviously made a difference for me, so just to make it clear I can't really claim to have made a 55 pound lean muscle gain in 5 years.

My very best bodypart from a strictly visual point of view is properbly legs. I honestly am a horrible squatter, and quite frankly pretty damn weak, but the way my legs have developed has been better than any other bodypart IMHO. Here is a picture from when i was 14-18. I unfortunatly don't have any newer pics atm.   http://i.imgur.com/AbuRyFF.png 14 in the first pic, 18 in the latter.  Now about my diet, I have always been a fan of IIFYM, since I have a pretty big sweet tooth. I follow the usual guidelines about protein and healthy fats, and fill up the rest with carbs. Pretty simple approach.  The only supp I use at the moment is creatine, and that's it. Well and a multivitamin a day.   Max lifts are currently:    Squat: 240 lbs. Weak but really trying to fix it!  Deadlift: 340 lbs. Also not very impressive.  Bench: 240 lbs. Yeah. I know. I know.  Military: 145 lbs.    And that's about it. Pretty simple approach to everything really."

Brogress,24v47v,ilykejosh,6,Tue May 6 18:21:35 2014 UTC,Here's my diet and training routine from another comment. I have always wanted to be muscular since I was 14. I didn't actually do anything about it until much later. The main kick off was joining reddit's 3 month body transformation challenge. After the progress I made I was addicted. I could never turn back.   And as far as supplements all I take is creatine and whey protein. And a pre workout which I just started 2 months ago.

Brogress,24v47v,Radicalbroo,8,Tue May 6 19:26:43 2014 UTC,"I really appreciate the kind words! I was you just a couple years ago. Never stop believing in yourself because no one else will. You can have that body you want just make the small effort everyday to train and eat right. All that time adds up quick when you look back.   My diet is the same most days. It's pretty simple:  Meal 1: 1 scoop Serious Mass Whey Protein with 2 cups soy milk  Meal 2: 2 toasted cinnamon raisin bagels loaded with 2-3 tablepoons of peanut butter each  Meal 3 (post workout): 1 scoop Serious Mass Whey Protein, 2 cups soy milk, 1 frozen banana, 1/2 cup natural peanut butter, 1 cup water all blended together. (1600 calories)  Meal 4: 2 Morning Star Garden Veggie Burgers on a toasted bagel loaded with leafy greens and some cheese.  There are many other meals I occasionally swap in, but the mass gainer shakes are a daily thing. This is over 4000 calories and about 200 grams of protein. When I lower my calories which I am doing now I just use less peanut butter in my post workout shake. Doing so requires that I add in some extra protein so I put in an addition scoop of whey isolate protein (25 grams) into my post workout shake.   As far as my training goes it looks like this:   Monday: Back, Calves, Abs  Tuesday: Chest, Abs  Wednesday Legs Day 1, Calves  Thursday: Shoulders, Traps, Abs  Friday: Arms, Abs  Saturday: Legs Day 2, Calves  And for specifics, you can see a sample of my personal routine on my website here:  http://www.jasonhfitness.com/?page_id=40"
Brogress,24v47v,blackrose_dying,1 point,Tue May 6 23:14:11 2014 UTC,Thank you! I went to the site but what do you mean by  Superset – Lat Pulldown 10 reps Seated Cable Row 8 reps Drop Set 10 reps (4 sets)  I've never done a super set and drop set it the same exercise.
Brogress,24v47v,salgor,2,Wed May 7 00:06:10 2014 UTC,Good question!  You would do a lat pulldown for 10 reps. Without taking rest you jump to the next exercise (superset) seated cable rows for 8 reps. As soon as you finish (again without taking rest) you lower the weight on the cable rows (drop set) and do an additional 10 reps. This all equals one round or set. So even though you technically just did three sets back to back I refer to this as one set or one round. From this point you rest 30 seconds to a minute and then do the entire three parts again for the prescribes set. In this case 4 total.

Brogress,24v47v,DorkmanScott,3,Tue May 6 20:14:43 2014 UTC,"Damn that's awesome! Keep it up. I would caution you though to be careful of how much you are eating. Do you know your daily caloric intake? Honestly if you are gaining 30+ lbs a year as much as half could be fat. I've averaged less than 20lbs of weight gain a year. In fact the first year or so I made it to 210 then weighed the exact same thing a year later! The difference is a year later I had way more muscle and was leaner. It's not worth it to be putting on a lot of fat. You will have to lose it anyways. The more fat you have to lose the longer you have to be in a caloric deficit which could mean muscle losses. Just my two sense from trying the 5-6000 calorie a day method vs. my current more reasonable 3500-4000 ""bulking diet"". Also you need to be hitting the gym consistently or else nothing matters haha."

Brogress,24sem2,podster310,23,Mon May 5 19:41:56 2014 UTC,"4 years between those photos, but last 2 years I work out and go to gym.  Workout: First 6 months of gym was hell. Many days I skipped and didn't go and stayed home. I was so weak. All guys in gym seemed so strong and had very bad looks towards me and some bad comments. I come from Eastern European country where many guys in gym are criminal-like with big ""macho"" mentality so I had to fight with myself to be regular in gym. I would work out at home with dumbbells, push ups and abs workout. When I got some strength I become regular in gym, 4 days per week.   Diet: Breakfast is boiled eggs, at begging only 2, now I eat 4-5 with some cheese and sometimes tuna. Lunch and dinner is a lot of white chicken meat with rice and vegetables. Snacks will be walnuts, almonds...And of course, I eat everything, but this is most common."

Brogress,24r0ce,Deathstrokecph,6,Mon May 5 15:40:30 2014 UTC,"I raced on my club collegiate team as a Freshman through Senior year.  It was pretty much training year round with a few weeks off following Nationals.  Training consisted of 2-3 workouts everyday.  It usually looked like this:  Monday: 1 hour swim; ~1 hour track workouts  Tuesday: 45 minute morning lift/core; 1 hour swim; ~1.5 hour bike interval workout  Wednesday: 1 hour swim; ~1 hour tempo run  Thursday: 45 minute morning lift/core; 1 hour swim; ~1.5 hour maintenance bike ride  Friday: 1 hour swim; ~2 hour intense Brick workout (bike/run/bike/run)  Saturday: 2-3 hour long bike ride  Sunday: 1.5 hour long easy run  We raced Olympic distance triathlons (1500m swim, 40K bike, 10K run).  As to why I'm transitioning, it is mostly because I'm ready to try something new.  Also, you put a lot of time and effort into training for triathlons, but your body doesn't really show for it.  If you look at the world's fastest triathletes (i.e. the Brownlee Brothers) they have to cut to a pretty small weight and even though they train probably 30+ hours a week, you couldn't tell - so a little on the vanity side.  I still love the sport and probably will return to it, however I'm just ready for a change for the next few years following graduation from my University."

Brogress,24n5ch,thesorrow312,3,Sat May 3 20:03:45 2014 UTC,a dude at my gym literally leg presses 1200. fucks me up.
Brogress,24n5ch,thesorrow312,-1,Sat May 3 20:12:08 2014 UTC,"A dude at my gym leg presses over 1000... moving the sled about 4 inches. I fucking hate him so much. He takes his sweet time walking across the gym to grab each plate when he loads it up, ensuring that everyone notices how much weight he's doing for 1/10 ROM."
Brogress,24n5ch,Dr_Stephen_Colbert,0,Sat May 3 20:46:05 2014 UTC,"No one cares about leg presses. I can legpress 750lbs and squat NOT AS MUCH, and people don't give a fuck about the leg press and actually want to know about the squatting."
Brogress,24n5ch,Dr_Stephen_Colbert,2,Sat May 3 21:11:38 2014 UTC,Your squat is legit. Your deadlift should be substantially higher than your squat though. What is going on there?   Give it a little technique work and it should blow up.
Brogress,24n5ch,powertron,5,Sat May 3 21:39:26 2014 UTC,"I haven't been doing DL as long as I've been squatting, and then I had to take a break because I royally fucked up my back trying to push my DLs to high too fast.  Ya, it's frustrating for me.  Some of the girls on xxfitness DL more than me  v sad"
Brogress,24n5ch,thesorrow312,1 point,Sun May 4 00:15:08 2014 UTC,"Its OK dude if you take your DL seriously and get into a good form and setup your DL will jump up very quickly.   Make sure to get on a serious program, not just random stuff."
Brogress,24n5ch,thesorrow312,1 point,Sun May 4 06:55:15 2014 UTC,"I just finished up the MFT28 program, which is more or less 4 weeks of 5 days of 2-a-days, which is pretty serious...although I didn't eat enough to get the gains I wanted to (oops).  And, ya, starting to get serious on DL again.  That's a move I can lift heavy on, since I don't need a spotter.  I'll probably try to see what my 1rm is this week."
Brogress,24n5ch,TheIslander829,1 point,Sun May 4 06:51:57 2014 UTC,"Ditch that stuff for a strait up strength program like Madcow5x5, add some extra accessories to it like dips, pull ups. Then you can add curls and face pulls and so on as well.  Keep it compound heavy, and an important aspect of a program is that they have intelligent progression built in."
Brogress,24n5ch,mokarney,1 point,Wed May 7 03:21:07 2014 UTC,"Links?  Also, honest question...what's wrong with the MFT28?  I'm nowhere near an experienced lifter, but it looked like a decent one to me.  Or was I just fooled by the 2-a-days?"
Brogress,24n5ch,haircurly,1 point,Sun May 4 07:59:00 2014 UTC,"too many movements that suck. Smith machine stuff? Its just too much.  The meat of any lifting program should be back squat, deadlift, bench press, and overhead press.  Other important lifts are front squat, dips, and pull ups, as well as potentially deadlift variations like SLDL, and Sumo deadlift. To round out a movement, isolation work like bicep curls and face pulls also have their place.   So just as an example, a squat day / leg day could look like this:  Back squat 5x5 @ 85% of 5 rep max  Front Squat 3x5 @ 60% of Back Squat 5 rep max  Glute Ham Raise 3x10.  The routine you did has a lot of fluff and bull movements.  Its important to focus on the primary movements, what puts the most meat on your body and the improves your big lifts the most.   http://stronglifts.com/madcow-5x5-training-programs/  That is Madcow, and here is 5/3/1 Big But Boring.  5/3/1 has you progress slower than madcow, but each main lift (squat, deadlift, overhead press, bench press) gets its own day, which many people like a lot.  http://www.jimwendler.com/2013/05/boring-but-big/  See how minimalistic they are? Less is more. The only reason to include more movements into a routine, is if they are needed. Not just because."

Brogress,24n5ch,aakash77,1 point,Sun May 4 07:34:33 2014 UTC,Why did you decide to not finish the Get Swole program? It seems like you were getting massive results from it. Your first post actually motivated me to get started on it and I've notice a difference after week 4. Starting week 5 on Monday.
Brogress,24n5ch,duckst0ry,2,Sun May 4 07:40:06 2014 UTC,"I finished it, I just started on week 7 and did the final 10 weeks of it.  I did it that way initially because I wanted to finish it up on my 30th bday, and I already had experience in the gym so I didn't really need that first foundation phase as much as people just starting out do.  I think I would have gotten better results on this MFT28 workout if I'd eaten more during it, but I've always been a hardgainer.  As for you, good job!  Keep it up.

Brogress,24kvmt,mtg4l,1 point,Sat May 3 14:06:33 2014 UTC,Seriously...a 17 year old pounding food and milk can get so strong so quick.
Brogress,24kvmt,Devvils,6,Sun May 4 21:27:28 2014 UTC,Starting Strength  Your original pic looked reasonably aesthetic. You really need some strength training + diet to get that killer look.
Brogress,24kvmt,renewedhope,2,Sat May 3 03:42:06 2014 UTC,Just as you know with the weight loss progress being lengthy... the lifting progress can be even lengthier at times.  Don't give up. 2 x a week minimum and you'll make slow/steady results.
Brogress,24kvmt,ilovemagicmush,1 point,Sat May 3 15:57:14 2014 UTC,"Depends honestly. Do you want to be strong and aesthetic or only look big? Strength and hypertrophy, while correlated to quite an extent, are different concepts.   Starting Strength (a strength program) would be a a good starting place as /u/Devvils mentioned. After 6 months on it, I recommend you graduate to PHAT (a strength-hypertrophy hybrid program).   Don't start PHAT directly; you need to have lifting experience and good form from Starting Strength before you start PHAT."
Brogress,24kvmt,miniun,1 point,Sat May 3 14:08:17 2014 UTC,Personally I would follow something like GSLP (greyskull linear progression). It's good to focus on compound lifts mainly if you're new.

As for my diet, I've been living at school the past 9 months so my diet is real simple. I don't know if it would be applicable for everyone cause it consists of a TON of cottage cheese, pb, and tofu.   A sample day (basically every day)  Breakfast:  5 egg whites 1/2 fat free milk 3/4 cup cottage cheese w/ pb (I indulge) and cinnamon  Meal 2: Spinach (raw), broccoli, cucumber, peppers and whatever meat (not dosed in sauces) that's available.   Meal 3:  Same as above.   Meal 4 (before bed) 1 cup cottage cheese Tofu (soft cubes) 2tbsp pb (Mix that all together. It's amazing!)  So it's basically that every day because at school it's hard to keep macros in line because of the volatility in healthy food available. So if you're training at school, rely on the foods that are always available (salad, cottage cheese, etc.) this way allows you to track your daily macros."

Four years since then and I'm still loving every minute of life and working out. :)  Workout   I’ve been on an Upper/Lower split for three years now, love it:    A: Deadlift, hamstrings, pecs, triceps, calf B: Heavy press, high rep rows, shoulders, biceps, abs C: Squats, glutes, pecs, tris, lower back D: Heavy rows, high rep press, lats, bis, forearms    Go as often as you can, work heavy, work hard. I mix things up to keep it interesting.  For presses I pick from military, incline, flat and barbell or db.  Rows: db rows, bb rows, underhanded bb rows, seated cable, corner barbell, etc.  Squats: back, front - a2g, baby. Quirks: I rarely do barbell benching.  I’ve seen too many people report injuries to make it regular piece of my routine.  When I was training for a PL meet I went 5/3/1 on it and saw some nice gains but whatevs.   Diet   Calories - 2800, 1800 while cutting Protein - 160g, always. Carbs, Fat - Whatever remains I was too heavy for my home scale when I started (It had a max of 330 - I stepped on it and the digital readout only said “E”) so I’m guessing that I weighed 335-340ish. I dieted down to 200.5 (pic) but prefer the 215ish range, a good mix of strength/size for me. I figure I’ve lost about 150-160 pounds of fat overall. Can’t afford the skin surgery.

This is mine which is probably the most pleasant panniculus image you're going to find.  Don't google it.  And don't google it because I told you not to google it. :)

I had a circumferential body lift, inner thighplasty, and male breast reduction (all separate procedures) in a one-year window and the total out of pocket cost was in the $35k range. Worth every damn penny.  Congrats on your success. You look awesome and jacked."

Brogress,24gshq,SwampThingsYouKnow,2,Fri May 2 04:23:23 2014 UTC,When did you start losing all the weight? Was the majority of the weight loss recent or did you lose a majority of it back in 2010?
Brogress,24gshq,feedmesc,3,Thu May 1 23:41:26 2014 UTC,"I lost 111lbs from 2010-05-01 to 2011-05-01 on a very low carb/keto eating plan.  Maintained that for about a year, struggled to take it lower through simple carb counting.  Switched to macro dieting/calorie counting in May of 2012.  Went down to 200.5 in September 2012.    200.5 left me feeling 'small', weirdly enough.  I slowly brought my weight back up into the teens and am very happy here."
Brogress,24gshq,mastrann,2,Thu May 1 16:58:23 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I was afraid of this though... I was hoping your massive weight loss was more recent and that you were just lifting prior... I heard majority of loose skin bounces back after a couple of years. I was 380 and now 230, focusing on lifts and hope to catch your lifts here in about 4 to 6 months. I was just not going to get the surgery for a couple years and see what bounces back, but it doesn't seem like it bounces back to the point of waiting."
Brogress,24gshq,downquark5,3,Thu May 1 17:08:41 2014 UTC,"It's not going to bounce back all that much, to be honest.  When people talk about loose skin tightening up, the intended audience is just people with a little paunch.  Those of us who strayed well into morbid obesity are mostly out of luck."
Brogress,24gshq,ELEMENTALITYNES,1 point,Sat May 3 01:03:47 2014 UTC,"Don't get me wrong though I think you look amazing, it is just a shame that the loose skin ruins that strong amazing body you put a lot of working into building. It's a shame that hard work doesn't fix how we originally wrecked our bodies."
Brogress,24gshq,Codidly5,2,Sun May 4 03:10:38 2014 UTC,"Question about your calories.  Is 2800 a surplus for you, or maintenance?  I, too, was formerly a 10-ton lardass, and I'm really afraid of eating at a surplus, but I want to build muscle.    A while back I tried lifting and eating at a ~500/day deficit and didn't even see beginner gains.  :("
Brogress,24gshq,Mshake6192,3,Sat May 3 01:05:41 2014 UTC,"2800 is maintenance and I'm very confident of it.    When I was switching to calorie/macro counting, I plugged my information into a TDEE calculator and it spit out 2800 which I was originally dubious of.  I spent a month eating a very strictly tracked 1800/day (i.e. a 1000/day deficit, 7000/week or 2lb/week) and I lost two pounds per week, almost to the ounce.  The math checked out.  I agree though - the thought of a 'bulk' like some people advocate gives me the hives.  The old ghosts of obesity tug at me and I don't think I'd ever be comfortable putting on a lot of excess fat in an attempt to maximize muscle gains.  I do have to say that carbs absolutely help - while I did gain some strength and size eating keto, I have much much faster progress when including more carbs.  I don't do sugars - generally only starches and breads.  Personal preference."
Brogress,24gshq,Rattus_Laboratorius,1 point,Fri May 2 14:22:28 2014 UTC,Thanks.  I think I'm going to try bringing carbs back in again and eating at maintenance this time.  It was rather demotivating to see zero strength gains during my last attempt at lifting.
Brogress,24gshq,ikickasss,86,Fri May 2 15:35:50 2014 UTC,"if you ever do get rid of the skin please post the results would be interesting to see, gj"
Brogress,24gshq,BabyRaperMcMethLab,-57,Fri May 2 16:27:05 2014 UTC,A common myth is that over time the extra skin recedes depending on genetics and such. The truth is the extra skin never goes away. There is literally no biochemical or natural physical process that reduces the amount of skin. Surgery is required.
Brogress,24gshq,Beer_Is_So_Awesome,66,Thu May 1 16:47:33 2014 UTC,Huh? I assume he meant in the case that OP has surgery to remove it.

Brogress,24gshq,Cammanjam,11,Sat May 3 21:17:53 2014 UTC,"All diet.  I really didn't do any cardio at all until I hit 240ish - I was worried about blowing out my knees or spine and having a big setback.    Even now I do as little cardio as I can get away with, ha! :)  In the winter I maintain the ability to run a single sub 10:00 mile and bump that up to 5K running in the summer months.

My goal is to get down to about 200 or maybe a bit more and then try to muscle out more than I already have.

Brogress,24gshq,Molinkintov,39,Sun May 11 03:14:04 2014 UTC,"Actually this is a very interesting question and I think that my answer to that has changed over time.  tldr: Not 'regret', but some sadness over life/time/experiences lost.  A bit of backstory: I was married young and it wasn't a happy union.  We were both inexperienced and couldn't fix the relationship problems we encountered.  We were both frustrated and I ate away my problems.  In August of 2009 my (ex)wife left me for another man.  I was devastated.  The paperwork was signed in April of 2010 and I had lost everything - my kids, the house, she even got the dog.  I was sick, withdrawn, bitter, and probably a terrible person to be around.  I bottomed out after the divorce became final.  By May 1, 2010 I had reached my breaking point.  I was going to give diet and exercise one last chance - my father had a heart attack at 42 and I knew that I didn't have much time left if I didn't do something.  I had high blood pressure, type II diabetes, high cholesterol, and was on depression medication.  For a long time I was angry and I hated myself - I channeled those emotions as motivation.  As I healed, the anger evaporated and I was left with lots of regret as my loose skin problem got worse and worse.  Eventually I recognized that a person can't find contentment/happiness in the present if they're still holding onto hate/regret/sadness over the past.  I've spent a long time working on 'letting go' and I can honestly say today that I've come a long ways.  Thinking back, I get pangs from losing most of my adult life to morbid obesity (from when I was 18 to a little after age 35) as there were a lot of things that I missed out upon.  But you can't change the past - you can only control the present.    Things are good.  The ex and I have buried the hatchet, the kids are thriving, and I have a long term relationship with a woman who loves and respects me.  I have a good life."

Brogress,24gshq,Rushlimbgnaw,2,Thu May 1 19:41:59 2014 UTC,How is the diabetes going? Have you been able to manage it better with the weight loss?
Brogress,24gshq,echoandbackreddit,2,Thu May 1 20:30:49 2014 UTC,"Everything is either gone (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, depression) and/or under complete control via diet and exercise (type II).    Let me go look up my numbers, hang on.    Date A1C    August 2009 7.0   July 2013 4.4    The July result includes a note from my doctor that says verbatim ""Here is your excellent A1c result.""  My doctor is tough as nails, this is high praise from her.    Actually, this is a neat little timeline:   ** Hadn't started yet, resisting cholesterol medication **    2010/01 Your LDL is above the goal we would like for you given your diabetes. I would recommend we start you on a medication for this at this point.  The alternative is to really cut out all bad fats (saturated and trans fats) and cholesterol in the diet and recheck in 3 months to see if there is any change - diet can make a difference but often only about a 10% change for most people.  Your goal is to have the LDL below 100. Let me know what you prefer to do at this point.   ** Five months in **   2010/08 Great results - way to go.  Your A1c is in a normal range even off of medication!  (this next bit is me resisting cholesterol medication) Here is your LDL cholesterol result. Ideally, for a diabetic, your LDL should be below 100. Given your completely normal A1c right now I find it hard to push you to start a cholesterol medication. However, as we discussed today we don't really know what to do with folks like you who basically ""undo"" your diagnosis of diabetes.  So, if you wanted to be very aggressive about preventing heart disease we could put you on a cholesterol medication to get the LDL cholesterol below 100. I would consider this especially given your family history of your dad's heart disease. We can always stop cholesterol medication as you continue to get closer to your goal weight. If you are not quite ready for that, then lets plan to recheck your fasting lipid panel (that tells us the good, bad and total cholesterol numbers) in about 3-6 months with another HgA1c.  (doctor chat)  Let me know what you think. At minimum, we should recheck the cholesterol with the fasting panel in 3-6 months.  2011/02  Your A1c is completely normal! Also your liver tests have normalized which is also probably from your weight loss! So I will send the other results along when they are back.  2012/09 - Your labs look great!  The fun thing to note is that your HDL (good cholesterol) has gone up dramatically since you have lost your weight - this is heart protective cholesterol  - so it is great to see it has improved so much!  2013/07 - Here is your excellent A1c result.   So anyways I was on Metformin (type II), whatever the most common high blood pressure medication was, one of the more popular SSRIs, and was actively being a disobedient patient by not taking cholesterol medication.  With my doctor's blessing I've come off of every single one and am currently medication free.   I either dodged a bullet or gained my health via a healthy lifestyle, or both I guess. :)"

Brogress,24c2s9,joevsw0rld,13,Wed Apr 30 02:33:56 2014 UTC,"Hey everyone - I started lifting seriously six months ago and haven't looked back since. Last October 29th I took a good hard look at myself and decided to change for the better. I had lurked this page and it inspired me to make a positive impact on my life by trying to get fucking huge. Here's my details as follows:  Starting Stats  *BP - 100 *Squat - 135 *OHP - 75 *D/L - 135  First Three Months - very similar to SS but with more volume. Increase your lifts each day by 5lbs if you rep with good form. I've lifted for very short stints a few times throughout my life so I wasn't a completed beginner. I consider myself athletic but had been a lazy ass through college.   *A: Squat 5x5, Deadlift 3x5, Pull-ups 3 x F, Chin Ups 3 x 5 *B: Squat 5x5, Bench 5x5, OHP 5 x 5, Push Ups 3 x F  Example Week:  *Sunday: A *Monday: Rest *Tuesday: B *Wednesday: Rest *Thursday: A *Friday, Saturday: Rest  Repeat the next week starting with B.  Months 3-6  I did Cool Cicadas Push, Pull, Legs as follows  Push (Chest/Triceps/Shoulders):   Flat Barbell Bench Press: 3x5 Seated (or Standing) Barbell Shoulder/Overhead Press: 3x5 Incline Barbell Bench Press: 3x5 Dumbbell Side Lateral Raise: 3x10-12 Rope Pushdowns (circuit machine): 3x10-12 Overhead Dumbbell Extension or similar triceps exercise: 3x10-12 Shrugs(circuit machine or dumbbells): 3x10-12   Pull (Back/Biceps):   Deadlifts 3x5 Barbell Rows: 3x5 Lat Pulldowns with (Long Bar or V-bar) (circuit machine): 3x8-10 Seated Rows (circuit machine) - optional if already doing barbell rows: 3x8-10 Face-pulls: 3x-10-12 Barbell Bicep Curls (Alternate between close and normal grip): 4x-10-12 Choice of one other bicep exercise (typically Hammer Curls): 3x10-12   Legs (Quad/Ham/Calves):   Barbell Squats: 4x5-6 Leg Extensions (circuit machine): 3x10-12 Hamstring Curls (circuit machine): 3x10-12 Standing Calf Raises (circuit machine): 5x10-12   I run Push/Legs/Pull/Rest (then repeat). I find that always having 1 day before Push and Pull really helps with my recovery. I don't mind doing squat then deadlift on back to back days as much. I also added deadlifts to pull day.  Diet I ate anywhere from 3500-4000 calories a day. For the past few weeks I've been eating more towards 3000. 40P/40C/20F. Example diet  *Breakfast: 5 eggs scrambled, 1 piece of wheat toast w/ PB, 12 oz 2% milk, 2 cups of coffee *Lunch: Healthy bowl from Chipotle or Flame Broiler with double meat. Lots of beans, brown rice, meant, veggies, no cheese/sour cream, 12 oz 2% milk *Snack: 12% oz 2% milk and a protein bar or mixed nuts *After Gym: 1 scoop of whey  *Dinner: 1lb of chicken or fish with a side of some veggie or wheat pasta or beans 12% oz 2 % milk -Snack: Mixed Nuts/PB sandwich on wheat with 12oz 2% milk or a protein shake.  I drink a lot of fucking milk, it's awesome  Lessons Learned Consistency is key. There has been days where I've skipped the gym from being lazy, hungover, or unmotivated. That was at first. I've grown to love the gym and regularly spend 1.5 hours there and go 5-6 times a week. We all have our reasons for going. I was in month 3 of my first real job, gained a bunch of weight, had just broken up with my girlfriend, and in terrible shape. I decided to make a positive change. I'm not stopping anytime soon and will definitely update in another 6 months!  *My pic resolution got fucked up,  here's my first pic http://imgur.com/wgWIGwq  here's six months later http://imgur.com/baKwGnS"

Brogress,24c2s9,timesnewboston,1 point,Wed Apr 30 17:31:47 2014 UTC,"I could probably bench about 210-215 1RM. I have always struggled with my bench and have hit a wall for the past month, it's pretty frustrating. I have crazy strong legs and have no problem squatting and deadlifiting but I just cant seem to get my bench up. I'm sitting at 135 3x5 with my OHP."
Brogress,24c2s9,timesnewboston,2,Wed Apr 30 17:54:22 2014 UTC,"Damn, that's crazy progress on the OHP for six months. You should cut for the summer, you'll look awesome"
Brogress,24c2s9,blazingup,1 point,Wed Apr 30 18:19:04 2014 UTC,"Thanks man, appreciate it. You think so? Honestly my main goal is to get huge, I'm not too concerned about a 6-pack or anything (that's next summers goal) and I don't want to lose any strength or mass by eating at a deficit. Never really cut before"
Brogress,24c2s9,Lordofthegoons,2,Wed Apr 30 18:26:32 2014 UTC,Well you look like 15% right now. If you bulk for too long without a cut you could have a serious task when you finally want to get rid of the fat.
Brogress,24c2s9,BabyCheezits,1 point,Wed Apr 30 18:39:35 2014 UTC,"Interesting, I've never heard of that before. Ideally I'd like to stay at the same weight while putting on muscle and losing fat, I guess you can call that a lean bulk? Was thinking of just eating clean and slowly gaining mass for another 6 months then cutting hard. I'm not sure what would be more adventurous."
Brogress,24c2s9,Jerks_took_my_name,1 point,Thu May 1 01:41:44 2014 UTC,"Well, if you believe that bulking inevitably comes with some fat gain, an extended bulk means a longer cut."
Brogress,24ccwe,NewbieGainer101,2,Wed Apr 30 04:34:13 2014 UTC,"Any questions, I've been lifting for a year before this, I've done a few strength training programs so my numbers are decent. I've been taking a weight gainer in the last month and it's helped me put on the majority of my weight during this bulk.   I took the weight-gainer, because my diet wasn't dense enough to put on weight faster it was relatively slow."
Brogress,24ccwe,keithgullett,2,Wed Apr 30 04:35:21 2014 UTC,Which weight gainer have you been taking?
Brogress,24ccwe,NoExcuses13,1 point,Sat May 3 06:22:40 2014 UTC,"Mutant Mass, 1 serving a day = 1,400 calories or so. + around 2K+ calories in eating. 3K+ Calories per day. It's made me progress the most."
Brogress,24baur,adrocknola,4,Tue Apr 29 21:46:37 2014 UTC,"Maybe it's just the angle, but your arms look beastly in comparison to the rest of your body! Nonetheless, congratulations on your progress thus far. After a little bit more muscle development and a cut, you will be a tank."
Brogress,24baur,TheGraded,3,Wed Apr 30 02:05:41 2014 UTC,"Thanks bro. Yeah the recent picture is at a lower angle, however my arms are progressing at a much faster pace than my chest and back.

Brogress,24bhvf,TheLionest,1 point,Wed Apr 30 00:24:32 2014 UTC,Can I ask what you did for your weight loss? I had done cardio for a while to lose 50 pounds and am at around 170 lbs. now. I think I need a good 15 more pounds to start looking as thin as you did pre-bulk.
Brogress,24bhvf,TheLionest,1 point,Wed Apr 30 03:29:41 2014 UTC,just be really strict in your calorie count and start lifting.
Brogress,24bhvf,stanleythemanley44,1 point,Wed Apr 30 23:07:15 2014 UTC,Been lifting two months now and warm up everyday with half a mile. I've seen results overall but it is a little slower than I hoped it to be for my sides. It's not too bad as long as I know it's even slowly working.
Brogress,24bhvf,TheLionest,1 point,Wed Apr 30 23:38:16 2014 UTC,"Are you counting calories? This is a good thing to pick up if you want to lose that last 15. It won't be easy, but it can be done!"
Brogress,24bhvf,stanleythemanley44,1 point,Sat May 3 00:53:17 2014 UTC,"I kinda am, not terribly strict on it like using an app. I think I may be eating at my TDEE because I haven't lost or gained any weight since two months ago. Might have to start doing that."
Brogress,24bhvf,Saziel90,1 point,Sat May 3 01:00:37 2014 UTC,Yeah you probably are right around your TDEE. Just track what you eat for ~2wks and then eat less than that and the weight should start coming off again. 3500cal = 1lb of fat so a deficit of 500 a day is a pretty standard number to hit.
Brogress,24bhvf,MoxiCOXacin,1 point,Sat May 3 01:13:09 2014 UTC,"Seeing as my current is like your before, I'm considering following PHAT. What is the hardest part of your programme, in your opinion?

Brogress,245pmc,Iamwizardirl,55,Mon Apr 28 04:59:47 2014 UTC,"For my first year, I didn't do any particular routine (or diet). I did, however, try to make sure I hit all muscle groups evenly. My goal was to be as proportional as possible. So, my first year just consisted of learning how to properly do all exercises. I always trained till failure, which set up a good base for me (I think).  Year 2 - current, I've been running PHAT with an IIFYM diet. My weekly routine follows the same days as what's posted in the ""Simply Shredded"" article here:  http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html  When I stall or get bored with a particular exercise, I switch it out for something similar (this happens every couple months). All rep ranges and number of exercises do not deviate from the template. I keep the same routine, whether I'm bulking or cutting, constantly striving for heavier weights and progressive overload each week. A workout log helps me remember my previous weights and keeps me on track.  I follow Layne Norton's advice on bulking and only bulk for 4-6 weeks at a time following a 2 week cut. This keeps me fairly lean through out the year. I just got off a two month cut for summer and am currently reverse dieting to maintenance (which around 2900 calories).  When cutting, I eat at 2400 calories. Daily macro split is as follows:  Protein: 180-200g Fats: 70-90g Carbs: I usually fill the rest of my calories with carbs. This averages around 220-250g.  When I bulk, I eat at 3300 - 3400 calories. Protein stays the same, while fat usually increases to around 120g. Again, I fill the rest of my calories with carbs at this point, which is usually around 350-400g."

Brogress,243k7f,sendmeyourprivatekey,14,Sun Apr 27 17:28:09 2014 UTC,"I started lifting on June 1st 2013, took a break from September to December because I moved to another country for college and I had to get accustomed to the college life and what not. Went from 55kgs to 50kgs, and my stats went to shit. Took me around 10 weeks to get back to my PRs. I've been working out in a pretty shit gym back in my country, and also here in university. I was never able to bench because we lacked the benching ""rack"" or whatever. So I had to chest press using dumbbells instead. Again, like I said, I'm a college student, I can't cook my own food and whatnot, so I have to make the most out of the shit I have here. I used to skip legs when I first started lifting, because I'm a dumbass. But I started working on them in the middle of February, so I'm slowly getting there. I don't know what else I need to say, so please ask me whatever you have in mind! Sorry if my English isn't that good, it's not my native language. Thanks again."

Lunch: A chicken burrito or a grilled chicken wrap  Dinner: A chicken/beef/steak burrito or a grilled chicken wrap  And obviously snacks inbetween, whenever I get hungry.

Also stuck to machines for the first few months, now I only use them for specific exercises or if the free weights area is packed.   In New Zealand here so you'll have to make do with my metric units!  Last week I was doing: Benchpress: 5 sets of 6 x 65kg Squat: 5 sets of 6 x 70kg Deadlift: 5 sets of 5 x 100Kg"

Brogress,23y8zz,Zephyr4813,11,Fri Apr 25 15:59:39 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I could cut in three weeks if I wanted to by dropping down to ~2500 calories. It's a double edged sword really. It seems that it's difficult for me to get fat, but more difficult for me to gain muscle.   TL;DR No. Eat everything. No survivors."
Brogress,23y8zz,down_vote_city__,3,Fri Apr 25 19:46:24 2014 UTC,"Understood haha. I'm always so worried about fat that I feel it inhibits my gainz. This is inspiring, though!"
Brogress,23y8zz,down_vote_city__,9,Fri Apr 25 19:55:19 2014 UTC,"Well, understand that it's different for everyone. Between May- October of 2013, I was 173lbs. I reviewed my stats as I track weight, reps, sets, etc and found that even though I was getting stronger, I wasn't getting bigger. It was around that time that I started watching youtube videos to try to gain some perspective from some big (READ: Hulk huge) dudes and to summarize what I found. Do not be afraid to get fat. If you're not gonna hit your calories for the day, take your ass up to mcdonalds and get some mcdoubles. Now, mind you, your results may vary and it's very dependent on body type, metabolism, workout intensity, etc. but my diet for the past 4 months has been about:  10% protein shakes  30% #16 Club lulu from Jimmy Johns  20% Mcdoubles  20% Chicken  20% Fish  100% No bullshit dedicated gym time. If you're finding yourself skipping gym days and justifying it with yourself (I'm too tired and my form will be bad. I have to get up early. I'm a bitch soft like a wet flower, etc.) then try the following:  Get the Pact app. Get serious and get paid for it. If you're in the gym busting your ass to get fit, someone's gotta pay.   Get a gym partner. Become accountable to this person and allow them to motivate you and vice versa.   Hope this helps!"
Brogress,23y8zz,down_vote_city__,1 point,Fri Apr 25 19:58:17 2014 UTC,"Yep, this was very informative, thanks!  That's a huge struggle for me as I work a pretty physical job 40 hrs a week and by the time I get to the gym I'm like dead. But I've found (ironically enough) that if I go get food and a small coffee at the McD's across the street my workout is so much better.  I'm on ICF 5x5, not sure if you've heard of it, but it's 3 days a week, full body, but has a lot of volume to it, and I never feel unfounded eating like a beast."

Ill start with my current lifting schedule  Monday-Legs (Heavy) Tuesday-Chest Wednesday-Back Thursday-Arms Friday-Legs (Light) Saturday-Shoulders & Traps Sunday-Rest  Lessons learned ? Id say my greatest piece of advice would simply be consistency. If you set out a training plan and your getting results then stick at it. But make sure that you change up your training frequently to force growth. Also I'm a fan of high volume and heavy sets. They've really helped me with thickness and general bulk. Id also advise reading Arnolds Encyclopaedia of bodybuilding (Guess this is fairly common)as some of the principles of training talked about in the book are second to none  Mistakes ? Buying into so many supplements particularly in my earlier years. I also wish I would have started lifting earlier if possible to take advantage of all that growth hormone!  I'll try and find some older pics but unfortunately my old laptop is completely wrecked."

Brogress,23yks3,hkguy1,4,Fri Apr 25 16:55:17 2014 UTC,Being a type 1 diabetic what is your diet like? and your insulin amounts/frequency?
Brogress,23yks3,joeban1,4,Fri Apr 25 20:44:29 2014 UTC,I should imagine my diet is no different from anyone else who is bodybuilding. When I'm bulking I try to eat around 250g of protein and 400g of carbs per day. Cutting I'll keep protein the same at 250g and lower carbs to around 180-200 g and every 4th or 5th day have a carb up day. Don't really track fats during a cut but would say they'd be low. As for insulin dosage I take 1 unit of novorapid per 10 grams of carbs every meal and 1 shot of lantus per day which is a slow acting insulin. When I'm bulking I tend to become more resist to my insulin so I have to take more to keep my blood sugars in check. My ratio might change to 1 unit per 6g of cabs etc. Depends on how heavy I'm bulking really. The flipside is when I'm cutting I'll become overly sensitive to insulin and I'll barley need any outside of my main meals.   You should have no problem bodybuilding being diabetic. Just make sure you carb up somewhat before you work out and take a smaller shot of insulin than normal for that pre workout meal so you won't go hypo. It nice to have that nutrients shuttling effective during the workout

I worked out 3-4x a week and focused on increasing my strength. When you begin you can add 5 lbs a workout on a lot of your lifts, haha!  I pushed to eat at a surplus of 500 calories a day and I shot for 1g of protein per lb. If you have trouble gaining weight I would recommend eating constantly throughout the day instead of trying to eat all of your calories in one big meal."

Brogress,23w7ho,ssosina,1 point,Thu Apr 24 22:58:02 2014 UTC,Good progress bro. What are your lifts?
Brogress,23w7ho,down_vote_city__,3,Thu Apr 24 21:42:51 2014 UTC,"Flat Bench - 225 lbs  3x5     I only lower the barbell to about an inch above my chest or so. I started to feel pain in my rotator cuffs going all the way down, and once I switched to this it went away.   Deadlifts  325 1x5  It is considerably lower than it should be. I cannot stress how badly you should work on your form when starting out! I hurt my lower back because of bad form. My back is completely fine now though and recovered and I recently switched over to sumo deadlifts from conventional (doesnt strain my lower back as much)  DB Shoulder Press 3x8 - 65 lbs  I know I should be incorporating OHP but it aggravated my lower back when I hurt it. Currently working my way up with it now though :)  Squats - I was a competitive taekwondo fighter throughout my childhood and my teens so I think its affected my knee joints. I get terrible pain in my knees from going deep when i squat so I've been doing 3/4 ROM reps on a leg press. I know it will never compare to squatting though. I did order some knee sleeves recently so hopefully they will help!  Here's some other lifts if you're interested:  3x8 75 lbs Incline DB bench ;  3x5 165 lbs Pendlay Rows   I don't really measure anything else too closely. I always begin my workouts with the compounds so sometimes I have to readjust the weight on the accessory lifts due to how I feel."

Brogress,23ue2y,Pain_Brings_Gains,8,Thu Apr 24 08:42:02 2014 UTC,"Cheers bro Diet - started the change slowly, was still smashing beers for the first 2-3 months and eating sporadically  Eventually improved on the eating - chicken, tuna, fish, rice and plenty of veggies  Pretty much just drink water now, unless I make an idiot of myself, get wasted at a party, regret it later  Routine - gym 4-5 times a week, 2 muscle groups a day, 4 activities per muscle group"
Brogress,23ue2y,AceSLive12,2,Thu Apr 24 08:52:54 2014 UTC,What sort of workouts?
Brogress,23ue2y,AceSLive12,2,Thu Apr 24 13:28:29 2014 UTC,"Haha honestly man I googled Arnold Schwarzenegger workout and broke it up into back/bis chest/tris shoulders/forearms and legs/core  So as an example if you haven't looked up arnies stuff  Back: 3x10 chinups, 3x10 tbar, 3x10 bar rows, 3x10 over the back lat stretches   I found keeping a book with me helpful and recording my sets so next workout I'd start what I did for my second set last workout"

Brogress,23ue2y,BearTubz,1 point,Thu Apr 24 17:56:06 2014 UTC,"It's pretty good with just italian sausage flattened out as the ""crust"".  You can also make a more suitable crust with ground chicken, almond flour, some egg.  Needs LOTS of seasoning though, in my opinion, but the closest thing texture-wise.  I find it best to not bother with the fake shit.  But sometimes you just want the taste of a damn pizza, and cheese, meat and sauce are all keto friendly."

Brogress,23ue2y,dickndonuts,7,Thu Apr 24 15:56:42 2014 UTC,"I think /u/MISSTASTYMIKE may fear that you're assisted,   point is, whether you got to where you are naturally or on steroids, who cares? A transformation is a transformation, doesn't matter how you get there, steroids are like any other supplement you take, this flame on assisted people who have made tremendous advancements needs to stop- ask yourself: why do i see steroids in a negative manner? Yeah there are side-effects, but those side effects vary & can be managed."
Brogress,23ue2y,NikhilT90,13,Thu Apr 24 16:28:13 2014 UTC,"It's not about the ethics of it.  It's more about labeling the post correctly so people have an accurate point of reference.

Brogress,23ue2y,NikhilT90,6,Thu Apr 24 10:25:30 2014 UTC,"12 months ago I was all fat, skinny arms and tiny legs  I made the decision on April the 9th last year to join the gym, haven't missed a week since  By around June I started eating 4 times a day, oats every morning, chicken and rice for lunch, tuna salad for dinner, and one more snack meal   I didn't do any cardio throughout the year and was an awkward combination of muscle and fat for a long time but slowly the fat started coming off and I was seeing definition   I didn't specifically drop fat and then bulk or the opposite, it was gradual throughout the year"
Brogress,23ue2y,bromolol,4,Thu Apr 24 10:50:36 2014 UTC,Thanks for the response man. I'm in this kinda awkward place where I have some decent muscle under 25-30 lbs of stomach fat. I know I should focus on dieting and drop the fat but it's cool to see that a slow and steady pace pays off.

Brogress,23tku6,BananamousEurocrat,7,Thu Apr 24 02:19:25 2014 UTC,"Thx dude :) I started doing simple body-weight exercises, and got myself in decent shape. Then I fell in love with a girl, and long story short, it didn't work out. Was in a great deal of emotional pain, and lost my mind a little bit. For a while I stopped working out, drank every night, smoked a lot of weed, anything to take the edge off. One night I couldn't take it anymore and just wanted to explode, so I went for a run. Ran until I basically collapsed (I thought my heart was gonna explode and I was gonna die right there lol). When I managed to get home that night and crawled into bed, I was still hurting, but the exertion felt good. So I started working out a lot after that. weights, cardio, everything. The physical pain and stress was a good distraction from the emotional pain of my loss.  As far as routine goes  6 x 3min jump-rope  40min weights (2-3 muscle groups)  30min core  20min run  6 days a week.  tldr heartbreak was painful, working out and being sore everyday made it better. Now I'm over the heartbreak but I'll keep my gainz."

For instance, when doing the bench press, which is known as a movement to build your chest,  you are also incorporating your shoulders and triceps to perform the compound movement. Hence the word compound.  When you are doing pull ups for back, you are also incorporating your biceps.. etc, etc. I like training this way because I stimulate more muscle groups at once and because I can work each body part twice a week. Not saying that this training split is for everyone, but I have received great results from it."
Brogress,23rh8i,alrij,3,Wed Apr 23 20:22:39 2014 UTC,"Monday you do ""push exercises"" for the upper body: Bench press, overhead press, anything where the weight during the negative portion of the lift is going towards you.  Tuesday you do ""pull exercises"" for the upper body: Barbell rows, Pullups, maybe Deadlifts although some do it during legs, anything where the weight during the negative portion of the lift is going away from you.

I don't mean to denigrate your progress but your lifts are very low. You have made big size gains in your arms and shoulders, but your back, chest, and (probably) legs are way behind.    If you have goals of being bigger or stronger than you are today, I would recommend doing a BEGINNER strength routine to get your bench, deadlift, and (probably) squat up. That should only take a couple of months, and you can move on to an intermediate routine."

Brogress,23p7m0,Eigenspace,8,Tue Apr 22 18:38:34 2014 UTC,That's a lot of loss in a very short time. Do you plan to add mass back on or stay where you're at?   Your DL and squat seem pretty good but I'd say your bench is lagging.
Brogress,23p7m0,fisticuffs32,3,Tue Apr 22 18:50:15 2014 UTC,"I want get bigger (maybe like 185-190 lbs), but I hate bulking because I love my 6pack so much. I can't bear to lose it. So gains are slow. Since I'm going back tree planting again I'm gonna lose a lot of muscle. I guess I'll have to see when I get back to civilization if I want to straight up bulk until I get to a nice size or I'll keep doing what I'm doing now.   The other thing is that I really like running so I want to stay good at running and such and if I get too big that'll hurt my ability at that.  Yeah I'm unhappy with my bench, but I'm working on it."

Brogress,23p7m0,ruetero,3,Tue Apr 22 18:47:57 2014 UTC,"How old are you? I'm always hesitant to recommend tree planting to people as it was hands down the hardest thing I've ever done.  Think about this, on average I lost 5 pounds every week for 5 months. I was eating probably 4000-5000 calories a day. I lived in a tent got up at 6am every day rain or shine sometimes it snowed in the mornings. ate breakfast, got in a truck and went out to an old logging site, usually on the side of some mountain put on bags of trees that weigh ~80 pounds and then went out and hammered out trees for the next 11 hours.  You get paid per tree so you never take breaks. you maybe shove some deli meat or some brownies in your mouth or gulp down some water whenever you're refilling your bags. That's about as close as you'll get to a break.  However, I got paid an everage of 11.5 cents a tree and planted 125,000 trees. So great money at least for a young guy trying to get through school.  So if that sounds like something you can handle I say start looking into it. It'll leave you with lots of fond (and unfond) memories and you'll learn a lot about what you're capable of. My company is called Folklore Contracting but there's lots of companies up here in BC and Alberta to choose from. I know in my camp though, everyone got the job because they knew someone else who already worked there. It's pretty hard to get a job out here by sending in a resume unless they're desperate because they need to know that the workers they're getting are driven and will do anything for the cash."
Brogress,23p7m0,ruetero,2,Tue Apr 22 18:57:41 2014 UTC,"I'm 24!  Thanks for writing so much about it, I really didn't expect that.  Your first paragraph really gave me some good context to the wonderfully anti-lumberjacky image that appeared in my head.  But it still sounds like something that I wouldn't mind experiencing for one summer at least while I'm still relatively young."
Brogress,23p7m0,LTNBFU,2,Tue Apr 22 19:07:35 2014 UTC,"No worries man. If it's something you want to do, do it. Start looking around for companies that are hiring. I wouldn't recommend doing it for only one year though. It takes a while to get fast and start putting a lot of trees in the ground. It's almost always:  First year learn  Second year burn (through all that mad money you're making if you're irresponsible)  Third year earn."
Brogress,23pxvy,suuperfli,3,Tue Apr 22 22:56:04 2014 UTC,"Also here is a picture from a few years ago: http://i.imgur.com/7qDqWik.jpg  This is my 6 month update thread (see http://redd.it/1woz6n for 3 month)  My workout routine has remained generally the same. The last month I was out for about a week and a half due to illness which definitely affected my gains.   I workout every other day and do 3-5 exercises and do about 3-6 good sets each. My sets are usually around 4-8 reps. I also like to incorporate drop sets into my routine, and change it up all the time. The exercises I would say that helped me the most are deadlifts, squats, bench press, pull ups,  and dips. I've tried to maintain 3-3.5k calories a day with ~180g protein a day (give or take). I  have also recently started doing my sets without locking out, and putting my muscles under constant tension which I believe has helped a lot.  Also, my weight gain has been very hard to accurately track. I believe I have gained about 10 pounds, but it always goes up and down depending on what I have ate/drank."

I try to change up my rep ranges, but I almost never do a 1 rep max set (I don't really see this as too beneficial for muscle gain). Some days I'll do 4 rep sets, some days I'll do 8 rep sets. Also some days I'll do multiple compound lifts in the same day. My routine has become more variable depending on which muscles aren't sore and which exercises I feel work best for me"

Etc and then when you hit 11 or 12 go up a weight So a weight increase every week or so Dumbell bench press Squats Overhead press Dead lift or barbell row Lots of leg raises Every so often some curls or pull-ups"

Brogress,23pdoy,TrentonB,6,Tue Apr 22 19:37:06 2014 UTC,"I'm not a fan of the routine honestly. Needs more compounds. At your stage, compounds are more important than following a strict rountine. Basically the three (four?) lifts you wanna work on are squats, deadlifts, bench press (and overhead press). A good way to set up a routine would be devote a day to each of these, then have accessory movements. So the split would be push/pull/legs. Split that into 5 days however you want, whatever is weak, hit it twice a week.  You bulk the same way everyone does, figure out your TDEE (googe it if you dont know), then eat at a 200-500 calorie surplus, profit.  tl;dr routines arent important, compound lifts are. All you need to bulk is to eat a surplus of your maintenance,"

Brogress,23pdoy,DoodleKaboodle,1 point,Wed Apr 23 08:16:42 2014 UTC,"That one isnt bad. Back/chest day seems a little odd though. No deadlift (you dont have to deadlift, some people dont, but it is considered the best exercise for full back development.) It has you do pull ups twice? Is that a typo? Replace one of the pull ups with one arm rows, I am not personally a fan of dumbbell pullovers (Replace with face pulls? Back extensions? Some sort of row?), but some people like them. Add in deadlifts if you want. Without them, that routine will neglect lower back and traps, its your choice though."
Brogress,23pdoy,hoodbro__skillson,4,Wed Apr 23 18:02:00 2014 UTC,"In my opinion, a split is a real bad place to start. I'd recommend doing SL 5x5. Start with a strength program. You can do hypertrophy range accessory lifts too. I went from a chubster to strong and muscular in 7 months. You could do more in those 7 months because you don't have to worry about cutting."

Also for protein I found full fat milk, whey, fat free yogurts, seeded bread and cheese the best and most accessible sources. In fact 2 pints of milk a day got me a huge percentage of my calories and protein."

I have a question for you though, I need help getting my gf to gain weight, she tries but she has this image of what lifting weights will do, she does air squats and stuff but really that only goes so far. She's about 5'8 and 110 pounds and has battled with annorexia forever, she realizes it's not right, but she still battles to actually gain, she thinks she'll get ""bulky"" if she lifts weights and says ""I'll get arms like you"", which is hilarious because she's have to be on juice to get my size as a girl.   I've tried showing her pictures of fit girls etc and she just gets insecure as snippy. She loves having a built boyfriend, but the second I bring up her getting more fit she just snaps, it's hypocritical as all fuck and she's stubborn as shit to start with, any and all advice is welcome.

I went from doing 2 hours of cardio a day to 20 minutes and 2 hours of weights! let her know youll support her no matter what path she takes, just let her know that this was a way to help MANY people struggling with ED's to recover :)"

To stop fat from coming too quick, I exercised just over 20 hours a week (less intensive, more strength based).  My motto was that gaining fat meant you were replenishing your body + excess. So basically, no matter how hard you train you could not over-train (as long as you are still gaining fat). Just start chugging that milk, I gained a majority of my weight doing this (and it's cheap calories).   Hope this helps!"

Since I'm guessing I have a higher metabolism than you, just because of naturally being thin, I would also recommend you to slow bulk. But after working out for about 2 years, I'd say I'm a pretty good size. 205lbs w/ 16-17% bf. 16"" arms. Squat- 315 deadlift- 390 bench-250 (If you're wondering what results you'll probably have if you stick with it for a 1.5-2yr span) I'd just track your calories and maybe work in some cardio, if you're scared about gaining fat. But as long as you keep hitting the gym hard, that weight is gonna turn into lean muscle. You can accomplish whatever goal you want, the only obstacle is yourself. Keep that in mind."

This will help you find your daily caloric requirement for maintenance and balance out your body, you will stay the same weight but with more muscle and less fat. After you see some results and become comfortable with using myfitnesspal or whatever app to count calories, raise your caloric intake by a few hundred excess and keep lifting - this time either for hypertrophy or still heavy, then carefully cut down   Btw I'm just guessing I have no idea if this will work"

Don't change your diet, just make sure you're getting enough calories.  The increase in muscle mass will actually help to burn off some of that fat or at least keep you from gaining much more of it (given you aren't eating like a pig).  After you've gained maybe 10-15 lbs of muscle I would then begin to cut.  Hit roughly a 500 calorie deficit per day CONSISTENTLY and add in cardio a couple times a week, increasing your cardio as needed as you progress.  plateau? Up your cardio and lower you calories another couple hundred.  Watch and ""listen"" to your body.  Everybody works differently so play with numbers and workouts and see what works for you!

I've only started my cut, by the way so this is more of a ""where should I start"" question. Is 300- too little?  edit: I'm trying to stay away from cardio as well. With that in mind, am I cutting too slowly?"
Brogress,239797,dssssd,1 point,Sat Apr 19 01:57:50 2014 UTC,"300 is pretty low. I would say around 15-20% deficit to start out, but if you're currently at a 10% deficit it will be interesting for you to see how your body responds to the change.  3,500 calories in 1 lb of fat.  Divide that by 300 calories/ day and you get 11.6 (12 days) to lose 1 lb of fat  Divide 3,500 calories by ~500 calories/day (15-20%) and you get 7 days to lose 1 lb of fat"
Brogress,239797,down_vote_city__,2,Sat Apr 19 04:43:19 2014 UTC,"If you're a beginner and an ectomorph (AKA: skinny with little fat already) I would not recommend you even mess with cutting. In fact i would recommend the opposite, make sure you are getting MORE than enough calories. The biggest mistake beginners make is not eating enough. When I first started I had to force myself to eat more to reach my caloric needs. Working out is 50% workouts and 50% diet, you can't have one without the other and expect results."

Brogress,239797,thisishawkward87,3,Fri Apr 18 04:43:45 2014 UTC,"Keyword here being ""predisposed"".   The original research (Sheldon, 1940's) aimed to pigeonhole people into a specific smototype that was specifically looking for a link between general personality traits and body type. He didn't even study it from a physiological stand point - it was a loosely based correlation conclusion based upon interviews from a psychological perspective instead of a controlled study from an anatomical / physical perspective.   It gained traction during the 1950's and people are still holding out for the confirmation of Sheldon's theories. Confirmation bias plays a role here.   That being said: most people would fall into the ""average somatotype"" category with Sheldon's theories being more of a very vague guideline by which to program for the athlete.   If you don't gain weight, you should probably eat and sleep more.  If you don't loose weight, you should probably eat less, move more and sleep more.  Don't become so reliant on your genetic makeup to determine your physical outcome - it's not a blueprint but more of a set of potential guidelines. Remaining active through your adolescent years reaps benefits down the line but the course can still be corrected despite piss-poor habits.   Criticism for Sheldon's work is widespread and a simple google search would have saved you the time and effort of writing your response."

I mean, if you can support his evidence based on actual data, then, yeah, I'd be willing to entertain the notion that you're further evolved than just an internet guru.

Brogress,239asx,kylmith,3,Thu Apr 17 10:01:24 2014 UTC,"24 lbs for 4 months is still good progress. I don't know why you would feel down. Track your weight better IMO and see how it goes from there and make sure you have a progressive loaded program to help get your lifting numbers up.  Once your weight stalls, take a look at how you are physically changing.   When I started lifting I wanted to lose weight and it maintained well but then i changed up my workout, picked up SS for a few months and saw changes. When I saw the results I left SS and started dicking around in the gym with no clear path and I saw my strength getting weak after a couple more months and since then I started 5/3/1, currently doing the 3-month challenge, and eating like a horse. Although my weight has gone up 15 lbs, i am happy because the physical appearance at this weight before was not how I look now. I actually look more muscular and in better shape than i did before.  There are tons of programs out there to choose from. Grab one and stick to it for a couple months and change it up so you don't get bored. I got up to 270 at one point in my life, 21 to be exact, and about 2 years ago i got down to 185. I look better now at 205 than I did 185 then. Yeah, if i cut to 185 i would be stoked now but im still making strength progress with not too much weight gain.   TL;DR: Your 21 dude. Ride those young hormones to swoleness and shreddedness.  I wish I started lifting at 21."

If I feel myself getting too pudgy I cut back slightly. I just base it on how I feel at the current day or week.  Breakfast: - Large bowl of steelcut oatmeal w/ globs of peanut butter - 6 hard boiled egg whites - 2 bananas  - 2 glasses of 1% milk - (optional) Whole wheat bread w/ peanut butter and bananas spread between.  Snack 1:  - Protein Shake (Pro Complex Whey)  Lunch: - Too much Brown Rice / Whole Grain Pasta w/ Tomato Sauce and Cheese - 3 Chicken Breast - ALOT of whatever the mixed vegetable meal of the day is - 2 glasses of 1% milk - 1 banana  Snack 2: - Probably a brown rice w/ vegatable stir fry   Dinner: - Brown rice/whole grain pasta w/ Tomato Sauce and Cheese - 2 Chicken Breast - Lots of mixed veggies or a salad - 1 glass of 1% milk - 1 banana  Bed time snack: -2 Peanut butter and banana sandwiches or vegetable and brown rice stir fry if it's available  IDK how many calories this adds up to but it's a decent amount and I eat more or less depending on how my body weight is doing.

Brogress,237268,Bstpitch,1 point,Thu Apr 17 10:13:13 2014 UTC,"Id go pendlay rows before pull ups. They hit more, so they should be a priority. (principle of always doing the bigger movements first)  You may get way too much fatigue from this. So your rows and pull ups may suck because the deadlift takes a lot out of you, or you could get used to it over time.  Give it a try and see how it goes. I've had success doing my pull ups on OHP day for example and I do my weighted dips on the upper back day instead of chest / bench day.  This gives you time to recover so that doing a whole bunch of movements in the same day doesn't become redundant and the last movements you do don't suck because your muscles are worked to hell and back.  Just some ideas."

Brogress,236i68,haircurly,1 point,Wed Apr 16 15:19:28 2014 UTC,"Sorry! I totally spaced on giving any details!  I started weighing in at 190lbs, December 2012. The first thing I did was start doing cardio - running around the track at the gym, tredmill, elliptical, or stairmaster for an average of 15-20 minutes. I gradually increased the time, to about 45-60 minutes for cardio per workout.  I started really low on the weights. I do an array of exercises, including arm curls, chest press, chest fly, (essentially any dumbell and machine that works out arms and chest). My biggest improvements have been the following:  -Pull ups: (with weight assist @ 6?). Now no assist, use full body weight. 10-15 reps / 3 sets  -Tricep pushdown cable: started at 60lbs. Now at 140lbs 10 reps / 3 sets  Bench Press: started just bar. Now up to 45lbs each side 10 reps / 3 sets  As far as diet, I started calorie counting hard. I downloaded the MyFitnessPal app, and stuck to a 1500 calorie diet. I would also drink whey protein with milk, blueberries, and peanut butter post workout to help from losing muscle.   The last 10lbs were the hardest. I had to cut out almost all carbs out of my diet, and eat very little bread. If I went to chipotle, I would get a bowl instead of a burrito. I would then get double rice, lettuce, and corn - enough to make a second meal. That way, I also wouldnt pig out.  Edit: I have also started playing Ultimate Frisbee with my friends once a week. This lasts about 2-3 hours. This has also helped develop my cardio, and get in further shape. It's a lot more fun than lifiting solo at the gym."

Brogress,2327mo,CreTiv,7,Tue Apr 15 05:08:50 2014 UTC,bmi if you had no fat. Weight - (%bf*weight) is used for weight. A lot of scientific studies have shown that you can't have above about a 25 naturally.
Brogress,2327mo,2gainz,1 point,Tue Apr 15 09:44:45 2014 UTC,I appreciate people knowing about FFMIs!!! but one thing that threw me off a lot until recently is that the study that outlines this concept measured FFMIs at around 5% body fat.  Obviously this guy is roiding but it does help clear up how slightly fatter guys can have a much higher ffmi!
Brogress,2327mo,Daitalianman2,1 point,Tue Apr 15 21:22:42 2014 UTC,"By that metric sumo wrestlers can hit as high as 35, but 1) at a much higher bf%age and 2) I wouldn't be shocked if doping was in issue in sumo:  Abstract  If limitations exist in skeletal dimensions, fat-free mass (FFM) might have an upper limit. To explore the upper limit to FFM, 37 professional Japanese Sumo wrestlers, 14 highly trained bodybuilders, and 26 untrained men were investigated for body composition (fat mass and FFM) and cross-sectional areas (CSA) of limb muscles, by hydrodensitometry and ultrasound, respectively. Mean % fat of Sumo wrestlers, bodybuilders, and untrained subjects were, respectively, 26.1%, 10.9%, and 12.1%. Sumo wrestlers had a significantly greater FFM than bodybuilders, who had a greater FFM than the untrained men. Six of the wrestlers had more than 100 kg of FFM, including the largest one of 121.3 kg (stature: 186 cm, mass: 181 kg, %fat: 33.0%). The FFM/stature ratio of elite Sumo wrestlers averaged at 0.61 kg/cm, with the highest 0.66 kg/cm. It is suggested that a FFM/stature ratio of 0.7 kg/cm may be an upper limit in humans. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.1310060509/abstract"

Brogress,233smt,upvoting751,6,Tue Apr 15 16:43:07 2014 UTC,"Dude you've got great size for your current leanness in my opinion. You cut down and you'll look even bigger. You look thick and pretty lean (especially compared to where I'm at at your exact height). I don't know how you looked when you started, I'm assuming you've been pretty lean if you're military with PT and such. Looks like solid numbers. What were your numbers before you started lifting a year ago? Also how's your diet/routine if you're active military?   I know my best bud who was in the Marines struggled to eat enough and mentioned it was hard to find time for lifting with various trainings, deployment, missions etc. How's the balance?"
Brogress,233smt,James_Dalton,3,Tue Apr 15 17:06:07 2014 UTC,"My diet homestation is pretty normal. I don't count calories or anything but I eat alot of chicken and steak and veggies (Colorado so there's alot of good butchers and farmers markets). I'm actually deployed right now so I've just had to make chow hall food work. I started counting my macros and while I was bulking I was getting about 3200ish calories a day with 275g of protein and about the same for carbs with a bit under 100g of fat. Now I'm doing about 1900 cal 207g protein, 80g carbs, and 75g fat. These numbers might not be 100% accurate but like I said I'm working with chow hall food and I have to drink more protein shakes than I usually would due to the fact apparently the locals think we're on a ship in the middle of the ocean in the 18th century and all the meat needs to be stored in barrels of salt. So I would say 75% of my protein comes from shakes and tuna fish). Unfortunately I didn't max out my lifts when I started, which I'm still kicking myself for but I can say that my first week I was fried from 3x8 bench at 225, 3x8 deadlifts at 205, 3x8 half squats at 185, and 3x8 OHP at 135. And now I'm working at much, much heavier weights, and still being good to go to do 3-4 accessory and iso lifts afterwards. As for your last question, it can be a pain to find the time here occasionally, but I'm lucky in that this isn't exactly a FOB in the middle of Afghanistan so as long as I wake up a little early I can stick to a routine. Thanks for the feedback! It's good to hear from someone else, instead of looking in the mirror on Tuesday thinking ""damn I'm looking huge"" and then looking on Wednesday and thinking ""My arms are tiny! And I look like I live off cookies and beer""."
Brogress,233smt,James_Dalton,3,Tue Apr 15 17:26:07 2014 UTC,Sounds like some solid progress. I was hitting very similar macros when bulking/cutting. I've got a little more fat to lose then you so I'm hoping to trim it back quickly.   Sounds like you've got a good routine down while being in the military. Keep up the solid work! If you do a cut make sure you keep those pics coming! Stay safe!
Brogress,233smt,PassionVoid,3,Tue Apr 15 18:57:30 2014 UTC,You bench 305 after lifting for a year?

I think maybe a dedicated bulk, then a cut would be needed, your upper body doesnt match your legs at all. Maybe with some front poses it would be easier to judge.  You could cut now, but I think you need more upper body mass. Mirin' dem legs tho."

This is definitely not the first time I have been accused of using steroids, personally I think it's a great accomplishment if people believe you used PEDs. But yeah, the CUT took 1.5 years,  Macros near the end to lose the last percentage: 100c, 180p 44f, WITH fasted cardio for 500 cals every other day. It was very difficult cutting to lose the last 2-3%, and it used to bother me how people think that you must have taken something to get this lean, but really its kind of funny now. I don't want to sound like a dick, but try eating 100c a day for prolonged period, and I've even went below 100c when weight was stalling."

I can 100% tell you that I've never taken steroids. I know thats rich coming from someone on the internet but I'm seriously against them. Not because of the side effects or anything like that but just because of the principle. I would say now I look pretty impressive for a natural and I can get a lot bigger as well as I've never really bulked and have 17 inch arms with a pump. If I started taking steriods..sure I would get bigger would I wouldn't look impressive AT ALL among other steroid users.

I've only ever had maintenance calories with heavy lifting to put on muscle slowly. I think I got blessed with pretty good genetics so it would be pretty cool to see how far I can get naturaly.

Brogress,22uyau,musclexdog,6,Sun Apr 13 03:17:05 2014 UTC,"No problem! This past off season, I bulked. I ate a shitload and of course ate lots of protein. I probably ate about 2000 calories a day. Obviously I gained bad weight, but thats a just the price you pay to also gain good weight! I'd look in the mirror and hate what I saw, but I had to look past it and realize it would be beneficial in the long run. My lifting schedule is Sunday-Hamstrings, Monday-Chest/shoulders, Tues-Back/bi's, Thursday-Quads, Friday-Shoulders and Tri's. In the off season, the reps for my main lifts on these days are low- between 3 and 8. Hardly any cardio.  So then after bulking, the cut begins! I start at about 1600 calories. Low carb, high protein, higher fat. Start with cardio 3x/week, HIIT training and also some distance running. Every week I make slight adjustments to my macros and up my cardio according to progress!   This off season, I will not do such an aggressive bulk because i'm happy with the mass I currently have. Obviously I have areas that need improved, but that won't require eating everything in sight and looking like a fat slob haha. So I will do something in between my cutting phase and my extreme bulk phase so I can stay lean but still improve. Sorry this was so long. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask :) Good luck!!"

Brogress,22uyau,fiftyseven,4,Sun Apr 13 19:32:54 2014 UTC,"Well it varies almost every week as far as reps go-  But an example during my bulk season is:  Sunday-Hamstrings Laying leg curls- 4x10 Stiff Leg deadlifts-3x8 Wide stance stiff leg deadlifts-3x10 Glute ham raise-3x10 Glute bridges-3x15 Seated leg curls-3x15  Monday-Chest and shoulders bench press-4x15 Dumbell incline-5x10 Pushups- 60 reps DB Shoulders-3x10 Cable lateral raise-3x12 Cable front raise-3x12  Tuesday- Back and bi's (I hardly ever do biceps or triceps b/c my arms are pretty big) Rack pulls- 4x6 Pullups-3x8 Dumbell bent over rows-3x10 v-grip pulldowns-3x12 seated rows (Underhand)- 50 reps Curls-3x10  Thursday-Quads Leg extensions-3x10 Squats-4x8 Leg press-3x10 + 1 drop set Lunges-3x15/leg Calf raises on leg press- 3x25  Friday- Shoulders and Tri's Behind the neck press- 4x6 Dumbell shoulder press- 3x8 Rear delt cable x's- 3x10 upright rows-3x10 Dips-3x12 Banded lateral raises- 50 reps  I work shoulders twice a week bc they are my weakest body part. I would definitely suggest doing that bc it has improved them dramatically. Also, I like the breakup of having a hamstring day and a quad day- It allows me to solely focus on them one at a time rather than working both on a single leg day. Sorry if this is way more than what you wanted to know hahaha"

Brogress,22w1zz,mpboyl16,3,Sun Apr 13 05:10:13 2014 UTC,"Thank you! For sure I can share. I think part of the reason that I had this progression was from lifting a few years ago. I built up some muscle, then got fat, and then cut to achieve this.  The routine I used was basically doing light weight high repetition circuit workouts twice a week, mixed with volleyball and occasional cardio.  What I used to do was track my calories and eat at a slight surplus while hitting nu protein requirements. For lifting I do either a full body workout or a push/pull/leg workout 3 times a week, 3-4 sets 8-12 reps and increasing the weights weekly.   That is about it really. I haven't stayed consistent but that is a huge key as well."

Routine: 3-4 sets for almost every excercise with 6-10 reps per set.  day 1: Back/Biceps - Deadlifts, chins, bent-over barbell row, bent-over dumbbell row, lat pulldown close grip, bicep charles with dumbbells, 21's with barbell, rope hammer curls.  day 2: legs/abs - Squats, leg extensions, dumbbell lunges, calf raises, legraises, suspended crunches with trx, declined situps, woodchoppers.  day 3: chest/triceps - Dumbbell chest press, dumbbell flyes, inclined dumbbell chest press, inclined dumbbell flyes, close grip push ups, dips, skullcruschers, tricep pushdown with both rope and bar.   day 4: shoulders/abs - ohp standing or seated with dumbbells, front raises with plate or dumbbells, dumbbell side lateral raises, dumbbell bent-over raises, same ab routine as day 2 previous.  I workout about 4-5 days a week plus tennis once per week.  I don't have time to write down specifik numbers of sets and reps but if you want to know anything else just ask :)"

Brogress,22sfuy,joshsoowong,1 point,Fri Apr 11 16:47:30 2014 UTC,How did you do it? I'm about your height and I find it hard to gain weight especially. What was the key secret to help you gain such mass?
Brogress,22sfuy,yousirnaime,2,Fri Apr 11 17:13:54 2014 UTC,"The before picture was after no exercising for ~11 months so this is somewhat of a recovery. I did strength training using this routine:   Here's what worked very well for me in my weightlifting class where I had an experienced coach that taught us primarily powerlifting for strength.  First week do 5x5 on bench, on the last rep of last set you should be almost failing, straining like you're maxing out. Do 2-3 times a week and makes sure you get 48 hours of rest to let muscles recover before you hit them again. Make sure you eat enough to have energy to lift. By the end of the week it should be getting easier to do this same workout. Next week, add 5 lb to each side and take off one rep from each set (5x4 now). Again should he hard first day but gets easier as week goes by. Third week 5x3, fourth week 5x2 adding those 5lbs to each end each week. Fifth week you max out. Do one rep of the weight you did last week, add 5 lbs to each side and try again etc until you reach your max. Here is where you build a lot of strength, a lot of it is psychological; you lift a heavy number and you become less scared of the lighter weights now. Now when you go back to 5x5 you are lifting heavier weights. I went from 125lb x1 in October to 185lb x3 in February.   I lift Monday-Saturday alternating between   Day 1: Benchpress and OHP + side raises for extra shoulders  Day 2: Pullups + Bicep Curls with an EZ bar + T-bar rows  As of a few weeks ago I've noticed I lack triceps and upper chest so on my bench days, before the side raises I alternate between rippetoe's lying tricep extension and omarisuf's slight incline bench. For my supplemental work I do 3x8 and try to do them really controlled and slow. If I'm not too tired i go 12 10 8 then drop the weight and continue until I can't complete a set with just my arms.  I know this isn't the best program but it worked for me before so I decided to see where it gets me this time  Nutrition:  PBJ for breakfast  2 scoops of ON double rich chocolate with ~1 cup of milk every day post workout   whenever I eat protein rich stuff like eggs or meat, I eat a lot of it"

Brogress,22sfuy,wheetus,5,Fri Apr 11 20:27:48 2014 UTC,"squats and deadlifts strengthen your whole posterior chain. Unless you're following a doctors advice, by strengthening only some parts of your back and not others, you could fuck up your body. Either way, good luck"

I'm self-conscious anyways, and I get even moreso when I'm around people who are fit, women in particular. I know that if I went to a gym, I would be obsessing over ""how I look"", and would never be able to give 100%.  Hence, I need something I can just do at home, by myself. Biggest question is; dumbbells, a bar, or something else?"

No one in the gyms cares who you are or what you're doing.  It's not some popular table in the high school cafeteria.

Brogress,22mjdn,Great_Hambino,1 point,Thu Apr 10 12:27:24 2014 UTC,"Kcal is 1000 gram calories. When you see ""calories"" listed on something such as nutritional info it is actually referring to kcal. source"
Brogress,22mjdn,SimaSi,2,Thu Apr 10 13:37:02 2014 UTC,"Calorie:       The name calorie is used for two units of energy.   The small calorie or gram calorie (symbol: cal) is the approximate amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius.  The large calorie, kilogram calorie, dietary calorie, nutritionist's calorie, nutritional calorie, Calorie (capital C) [citation needed] or food calorie (symbol: Cal, equiv: kcal) is approximately the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius. The large calorie is thus equal to 1000 small calories or one kilocalorie (symbol: kcal).    Although these units are part of the metric system, they have been superseded in the International System of Units by the joule. One small calorie is approximately 4.2 joules (so one large calorie is about 4.2 kilojoules). The factor used to convert calories to joules at a given temperature is numerically equivalent to the specific heat capacity of water expressed in joules per kelvin per gram or per kilogram. The precise conversion factor depends on the definition adopted.  In spite of its non-official status, the large calorie is still widely used as a unit of food energy in the US, UK and some other Western countries. The small calorie is also often used for measurements in chemistry, although the amounts involved are typically recorded in kilocalories.  The calorie was first defined by Nicolas Clément in 1824 as a unit of heat,  and entered French and English dictionaries between 1841 and 1867. The word comes from Latin calor meaning ""heat"".

Brogress,22mjdn,garnett8,1 point,Thu Apr 10 13:52:10 2014 UTC,"Usually when people say calories they mean kilocalories. Technically it's incorrect, but that's just the way it is. So kcal and calorie are interchangeable in my post.   Chest action is definitely enough. I do bench press, incline dumbbell flyes and weighted dips. The skull crushers that I do also hit chest a bit, so I'm sure it's enough. I feel like my chest sucks genetically, because it really just grows at the bottom and not really at the top, and incline flyes and incline press haven't done anything to change that yet, so without steroids I don't think I can beat a more 'square' shape or separation into them.  As for arms, I do only supersets, once for biceps and once for triceps per week, so yeah, I think I could push those a bit. But then again they also get hit by pretty much every other exercise in my chest and back workouts, and I'm happy with how they look so far."

I've been changing my diet and workout a lot, and took lots of breaks with both. Basically started really getting into bodybuilding about 2-3 years ago. So these pictures are from last year, and after that I've bulked for 6 months, and am now 3 months into a cut again, but that's work in progress :)   The routine that's worked best for me so far is a 4-way split, working out 4 times a week, about 90 minutes each. I do Chest/Tris, Back/Bis, Delts&Abs and Legs/Lower Back.   Diet is pretty simple. 200g protein, low carb and keeping calories around 20% below maintenance when cutting.  I just sent my whole diet/workout/supplement routine to a friend of mine a few days ago. I can dig it up on my work computer tomorrow if there's any interest in more details."

My current and most common split is chest/triceps/abs, back/biceps/abs, legs/shoulders, though I do change it up randomly every now and then.  I don't have a set routine, I usually just do between 3 and 5 workouts per muscle, sometimes I go heavy, sometimes I focus on lighter weight and squeezing the muscle.  I'm not sure which one is more effective but I do enjoy both types of workouts and feel like each one has its place.  My diet is pretty good 85% of the time, I try and stick to lean meats, complex carbs and get plenty of veggies, but I do love a good cheat meal every now and then and my love for beer is really holding me back from getting a true six pack I believe lol."

Since I started properly bulking in late January I've been on Phrak's GSLP and I've enjoyed it thoroughly, plus the gains have been really nice to see.   As a former-fat lad, it was always going to be a case of prioritising the upper-body to balance out my physique, and slowly but surely GSLP is allowing me to do that. It's still early days yet, and I want to do a two-month cut before my next bulk (which is gonna be a 6-month stint so I want to be at a lower body fat), but I'd like to thank /u/phrakture for his version of GSLP and the gains it has blessed me with so far!"

Brogress,22l864,JoeOpus,1 point,Wed Apr 9 13:07:22 2014 UTC,"Congrats! Feels good to get that waist slimmed down doesn't it? Your love handles aren't poking out when you sit down. Your stomach rolls arent just hanging over after a big meal and without the drugs and alcohol, you're not too fucked up and de-motivated that you actually look forward to going to the gym. I just described myself 2 years ago but I'm on the otherside now too.   Lookin' good tho'.  You're getting to the point where your BF% is low enough that if you focus on your abs a bit, women are going to start jumping out of moving cars at you. Yeah, like...right on ur windshield and shit. Maybe don't do abs."

Brogress,22ayo9,brian_badonde,4,Sun Apr 6 00:49:51 2014 UTC,"Can't tell if that's your neutral posture in the pictures but you might also want to consider focusing on your posture. Is it possible that you have some anterior pelvic tilt? Since you're only 17, having a good posture (and good lifting form) must be essential for you, even more so than the weights."
Brogress,22ayo9,brian_badonde,3,Sun Apr 6 15:53:03 2014 UTC,"slightly from alot of chest exercises and not alot of back, its being fixed :D"
Brogress,22ayo9,brian_badonde,2,Sun Apr 6 03:02:24 2014 UTC,Hey great progress! Im a beginner and should I do compund exercises 3 times a week or isolated with only bench press involved other isolated ones each muscle once a week?
Brogress,22ayo9,TheUnfaithful,2,Sun Apr 6 03:10:57 2014 UTC,"thanks :D depends on your goals. It is pretty accepted advice to run a good full body strength based program as a beginner such as Starting Strength, Stronglifts 5x5 or Icecream fitness 5x5. So take a look at those!"

Brogress,228qab,thecajunone,15,Sat Apr 5 05:59:40 2014 UTC,Very nice. What excercises did you do for the beard?
Brogress,228qab,snooplionylion,3,Sat Apr 5 07:15:22 2014 UTC,My stats: Bench press: 140kg/308lbs for 4 reps Deadlift: 200kg/440lbs for 3 reps  Squat 150kg/330lbs for 6 reps Barbell shoulder press: 90kg/198lbs for 4 reps Bent over row: 150kg/330lbs for 6 reps  Haven't tried 1RM to date but will do that soon! Squat is slacking as i tore ligaments in my knee and also broke the knee cap playing rugby but it is slowly getting stronger!
Brogress,228qab,AnnoyingMoFo,1 point,Sat Apr 5 12:08:26 2014 UTC,So your deads arnt affected by the torn ligament because (to me) they are pretty impressive.
Brogress,228qab,schutyser,3,Sat Apr 5 13:12:24 2014 UTC,My deads were affected for a few months but for some reason the strength came back a lot faster than the squat.
Brogress,228qab,JB52,2,Sat Apr 5 13:51:16 2014 UTC,I have no problem with my DL as well but getting my squat heavier is much harder after my knee surgery. You are huge btw!
Brogress,228qab,JB52,2,Mon Apr 7 09:06:57 2014 UTC,Thanks man. Luckily i didn't have to have surgery but even so squatting was impossible for at least 6 month!
Brogress,228qab,JB52,1 point,Mon Apr 7 13:47:29 2014 UTC,Strong numbers man! Did you have to get surgery for the knee or did you rehab it?
Brogress,228qab,JB52,2,Mon Apr 7 10:32:55 2014 UTC,Thanks man! I had to rehab my knee for over 6 months. The doctor told me he didn't want to give me surgery just yet as i am too young and he wanted to see if i would recover fully without the need for surgery. Luckily i tore the MCL and only sprained the ACL. If it was the other way around then maybe i wouldn't have been so lucky! Part of my knee cap is broken away but it hasn't caused any discomfort yet.
Brogress,228qab,JB52,1 point,Mon Apr 7 13:40:40 2014 UTC,"Good to hear you avoided surgery! What exercises did you do for your rehab? I've been dealing with patellar tendinosis on and off and have been to many PTs but they all give me different exercises to do. They have me doing clams, glute bridges, decline squats, step ups, and various stretches, but I am trying to see if they missed any good ones, especially ones that may have been key to your recovery."
Brogress,228qab,smrtprts,2,Mon Apr 7 14:08:32 2014 UTC,After resting for about 6 weeks i started with cycling. The first few sessions i only managed to do about 15 minutes before i tired out but i managed to bulld up to sessions of about 45 minutes after a couple of weeks. After this i managed to do machine exercises such as leg press and extensions and i only made the weight heavier if i felt comfortable. I have tendonitis on my knee now and i found that the best way to help prevent this is to do power movements such as sprints with a sled tied to my back and then sled pushing. After just one session of this i felt the difference straight away was insane!

Brogress,2251r9,Vistian,2,Thu Apr 3 23:45:20 2014 UTC,Impressive!   Can you give us any idea of your diet? -When you're bulking and/or cutting? (calories/protein wise)
Brogress,2251r9,Bstpitch,5,Fri Apr 4 00:00:19 2014 UTC,"Mostly it's the carbs that change. Cals as high as 3500, down to about 2600 (over time). 7 meals a day, starting at 6 am with egg whites and oatmeal, and continuing through the day, every 3 hrs, with a balance of protein carbs and fat. These pics were taken after a week of depletion, right before the show. So I'm pretty flat here. What can I answer for you?"
Brogress,2251r9,down_vote_city__,1 point,Fri Apr 4 00:06:22 2014 UTC,"Thanks!  What do you aim for in terms of grams of protein/day? Since I've heard ranges from 0.6-1.0 gm/pound, wondering what you go for... since it obviously has given great results."
Brogress,2251r9,2gainz,2,Fri Apr 4 00:18:25 2014 UTC,"I balance it with carbs as a calorie source more than anything. As low as 200, up to 450, depending where I'm at in terms of carb depletion. 1 g/lb may be more than has been demonstrated scientifically, but better safe than sorry."
Brogress,2251r9,thecajunone,1 point,Fri Apr 4 00:23:59 2014 UTC,"How low are your carbs when cutting? Also, how many hours of cardio per week?"
Brogress,2251r9,adamnemecek,1 point,Fri Apr 4 14:08:23 2014 UTC,"The lowest I go is about 80-100 g/day, but only for a short period of time. Typically I don't go lower than 120.   So, so many hours of cardio. 45 min stairmaster. Twice daily."

My coach is 154 at 5'7” and dwarfs me because he has been practicing posing for 20 years.   While our weights are similar, our measures of lean body mass vary greatly. When I am off season I clock in around 230, which would be a more accurate comparison.   Lastly, yeah 20 lbs is a pretty big difference.   Good luck, keep working! Time + consistency = success"

Find someone that competes in your gym and ask for help...competitors get hit up for advice all the time, but only very rarely about the more interesting stuff, like posing. Most guys I know are happy to help anyway, but you can only answer ""what's your bench?"" And ""how many reps/sets?"" before you go out of your skull.

Brogress,223mhj,nationalism2,1 point,Thu Apr 3 17:37:57 2014 UTC,"Also, wide ass bent over row, lowish weight, really really helps.    Is the bent over row more of a Pendlay Row or Yates Row?"
Brogress,223mhj,aj0220,1 point,Thu Apr 3 20:31:13 2014 UTC,"Had to look that one up. I think your question is related to grip...supinated vs. pronated? I prefer pronation, especially because I feel like it targets the rear delt more effectively. So I suppose this makes it more of a Pendlay row...back parallel (or as close as possible), head up, palms down, row with elbows high.   Like this guy, third exercise down"
Brogress,223mhj,Exnon_,1 point,Thu Apr 3 21:50:53 2014 UTC,"I think your question is related to grip...supinated vs. pronated?   My question is more related to the back angle.  A pendlay row is closer to horizontal, while a yates row is at an angle.  Based from your response, it sounds like your body is  more horizontal when you do the rows (i.e., Pendlay)."

Brogress,223mhj,Lewyalsodraws,1 point,Thu Apr 3 23:24:10 2014 UTC,"Thanks man! I had been going light on my deadlifts and not doing bent over rows due to some lower back pain, but I'll have to work them back in ASAP.   It's not too hard to get my back to grow, but usually more of the muscle towards my spine gets developed, so I need to focus more on getting the outer muscle for that wide V shape."

Brogress,223mhj,jsantos17,1 point,Wed Apr 9 00:08:35 2014 UTC,"Well, certainly some genetic predisposition. As far as total back thickness, nothing will ever touch deadlift, but I have to assume that's already in your routine. If it isn't, we've got bigger problems! I always start with super wide lat pull down (wide as you can go with the bar you have available). It's definitely more of a finesse move. Weight is good, but width here comes from isolation. Get the bar down to your chest, every rep, and I do a lot of forced reps too.   Next up is close grip pull down. Again, strictness is king. Full ROM etc etc  Next either t bar row or wiiiiiiide bent over, supinated rows.   Next is seated cable row...wide. Lean into it a little, back straight, elbows high. As a bonus, you get some rear delt work in.   I close out with heavy single arm rows every time too. And that's it. Above all, esp with wide exercises, you need to be strict while pushing as heavy as you can maintain."

Brogress,222fxl,Oh_Cabana_Boy,9,Thu Apr 3 01:56:16 2014 UTC,"Eat, lift, sleep. These are the three most important things in getting bigger.  Eating properly as opposed to simply eating whatever you see in front of you will be beneficial. Learn about the food you're eating.  As far as you're body catching up to your lifting, you cannot expect your body to go from no lifting, at all, to lifting multiple hours a day and expect it to keep up.  Even those who have lifted for years usually take one day off a week (this is in regard to you wanted to lift everyday). Maybe try lifting for 45 min/day at first; especially if you plan on going 4-5 times a week (which would probably be much more beneficial than going 7x/week as you're just starting off). There are many different routines/splits that you can try out and see what works best for you. Starting off, maybe focus on one body part per day. This is help you get in there 5 days a week, but shouldn't overwork any body part. When your body starts to get used to lifting, try multiple parts per day (back and bis) and do those same parts later in the week.   Sleep. Make sure you're getting proper rest. We lift to tear our muscles up, wear them out.  When we sleep, they recover and build.   If you're really interested in getting into lifting, try r/bodybuilding.  I'm pretty novice compared to most people in that sub, and they have much more to offer, advice wise, than I do.  Most importantly, remember that this takes time. You can't expect massive gains over night or in a couple months, for that matter. Gain knowledge about food and routines and take your time. Hopefully, this helps and hopefully the pic you posted will be your ""before"" pic a year from now when you show us some more brogress."
Brogress,222fxl,SimaSi,2,Thu Apr 3 02:29:48 2014 UTC,"This sounds like really solid advice.  I've been doing a good bit of reading, and it sounds like I'm actually over-training.  I've been doing    Heavy upper body   Heavy lower body   Running/rest   Repeat   Is this giving my body enough to time to rest?  Or do I need to space out workouts even more into my muscle groups like:    Chest/back  Legs  Arms  Abs  Rest"
Brogress,222fxl,JIVEprinting,1 point,Thu Apr 3 03:15:35 2014 UTC,"I do   Back, Biceps, Traps Legs, Abs Chest, Shoulder, Triceps Restday   You gotta watchout for your shoulders, because they'll be sore after back and chest day so you got a legday after the backday and a restday after the chest day, so your shoulders can recover.."
Brogress,222fxl,JIVEprinting,1 point,Fri Apr 4 20:38:55 2014 UTC,"Are you currently doing your entire upper body in one day? That's not a good idea. Currently, what I'm doing:  Mon-Back & Bis Tues-Chest & Tris Wed-Legs & Shoulders Thur-Back & Bis Fri-Chest & Tris Sat-Legs & Shoulders Sun-Rest  This has changed a couple times in the past 4 months and will continue to change.  Some days I feel like I get a really shitty bicep workout in so I'll throw a couple extra in on a day that I normally wouldn't. It's also worth noting that if you're super soar, let your body rest. Either work something that's not sore or just take a day off. I can't stress how important rest is. Working something that is sore is likely to result in injury. Because I'm cutting, I've thrown in 45-60 min of cardio at least 5 days a week. I'm also doing direct ab workout 3-4x a week but abs shouldn't really be a focus for an entire day in the gym.   If you're trying to put on weight, cardio usually isn't recommended. You're going to burn a lot of the extra calories you're trying to put on. Look up ""bulking"" and ""cutting"". Again, I'm a novice but bulking is what you want to be doing if you want to put on weight."

Brogress,222fxl,meowjinboo,2,Thu Apr 3 15:30:30 2014 UTC,"You need to follow an established routine and not try to spend some arbitrary minimum amount of time at the gym.  You take however much time it takes to complete the routine.  No more, no less.  It's not like a 2 hour workout is going to give you twice the results as a 1 hour workout.  In fact, it will probably have the opposite effect due to overtraining.  You're also at a much greater risk for injuries, which could put you out of the gym for weeks at a time.  With regards to your diet, I highly advise against eating everything you possibly can.  Everybody I've seen do this ends up gaining mostly fat and then you're spending 6+ months trying to trim down.  You need to determine what your daily caloric maintenance level is, add 250-500 calories, make sure you're getting adequate protein (about 1g per lb of body weight), and track everything you eat using a tool such as myfitnesspal.com.  An ideal rate of weight gain is .5 lbs per week.  Any more than that and you're just adding unnecessary fat.  Your body can only naturally gain about 2 lbs per month of muscle max.

Brogress,21zf3m,AaronN2395,2,Wed Apr 2 12:34:55 2014 UTC,It will sound obvious but I used to run and play ball and think it's all it took to get in shape. I then started researching and just found what to eat and how to lift and was able to see amazing progress quickly. I have certain issues with drinking that held me back but found I was able to deal with them when I was focused on lifting. The best advice I could give would be document everything you do. When you take pictures and track what you eat and how much you lift it gives you a steady goal to beat day to day. I have slipped up and fallen back in to my old ways but realized if I track what I am doing I am much more motivated. If I never drank I would look 10x better but I struggle cutting that out my life. What I think is most important is capture that feeling when you leave the gym after a great workout and how amazing you feel and store that for motivation. It's the confidence and mental gains that get me more excited then how I would look in the mirror

Brogress,21zfbm,adamentelephant,5,Wed Apr 2 03:09:26 2014 UTC,"It is amazing for novices(assuming you are since you hadnt posted your stats) and it's not just a strength base program as the overall volume will kick your ass once you lift heavy enough. Personally I've noticed mad gains for my back and quads. I started of fat too so I know how you feel but if you really follow through the program without fucking around and eating on a caloric deficit, YOU WILL SEE GAINS.  Also, once you stall for too long on a cut, I suggest running a 3x5 version of stronglifts. But the most important thing is to trust the program and trust that your choice is right. Hope you find this helpful and never leave the path of iron. All the best!"
Brogress,21zfbm,thelostbathysphere,5,Wed Apr 2 10:17:30 2014 UTC,Hey thanks man. Yeah I'm totally new to all of this. I planned on following it for at least to 12 weeks (I'm at about 5) before considering changing anything. No bullshit no excuses haha.
Brogress,21zfbm,canuckupyTO,3,Wed Apr 2 20:23:35 2014 UTC,"I ran it for about 6 weeks and found some decent strength gains, though not too too much in terms of aesthetic differences. I gained some weight in the form of my legs and glutes hardening up a bit. I thought it was good. I enjoyed the simplicity of the workouts, though I did add some accessory work. I think it's an especially good program for newbs to practice good form, since if you start with just the bar (as Mehdi suggests), the lifts will be super light."

Brogress,21zfbm,TatdGreaser,2,Fri Apr 4 00:43:59 2014 UTC,Stronglifts was great for me but it's really designed for strength more than anything which would explain you gains. As a life long skinny guy who's forever bulking I can help too much with the fat loss aspect. Good luck though!

You've made some fantastic progress man, but if I could give one piece of advice, it would be to not be overly concerned with gaining too much weight. No one wants to get fat, and if you're gaining 5lbs/week maybe hit the brakes a little; but at your current bf%, particularly at your age, you should just be looking to add mass. Eat as much as you can, hit the gym as hard as you can, and keep on gaining. Great work so far!"

Gallon of milk everyday with 3 huge meals as well. I ate way too much and gained a lot of fat as you can see here. Cut for about 4 months at a bout a 500 calorie deficit. And now I'm bulking again at +500 cals, and I will be for awhile."

Was cutting on 2000 cals, stalled at around 89kg. Reverse dieted up to 2600 cals, cut again at 2100. Injured back and got a bit fat over Xmas, dropped cals again two weeks ago to 1900.  About 150gm of protons, 70+ of fat and the rest is carbs. I do IIFYM, but still have a cheat day. Can't be arsed doing cardio.  Max low bar squat is 125kg x 1. Max deadlift (trap bar due to back injury) is 185kg x 2. Unsure on bench, I only do incline and decline DB press (usually rep out 12x40kg on incline as my first movement) Legs aren't as storm as they should be but the back injury has taken a LONG time to work through and to find the cause of, so I've swallowed my pride and am learning to work with it to minimise risk.

It was the the muscle above my right flute that caused the issue and the pain was right across my lower back.   Took me a while to find some decent treatment. I think basically not paying any attention to flexibility or anything, and that fact that I sit at a desk all day didn't help. I'm very conscious of my posture now and I stretch often and foam roll like it's the last thing I'm ever gunna do.  Also discovered my hams and glutes were firing enough when squatting so I've basically reset my weight on that and am working from the bottom again, as well as adding in core strength stuff."

Brogress,21r54i,liamcdog,1 point,Sun Mar 30 16:24:27 2014 UTC,That's a whole lot of calves. Is that specifically the area you need to work on most? Also what has been your Ab workout from the first pic to the second?  Great work btw.
Brogress,21r54i,Unique-Name,3,Sun Mar 30 16:32:25 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, calves are definitely my weakest point. As for abs, I really didn't do any abs during my bulk. Now I do 6 total sets. 4x30 of a machine crunch and 2x50 broomstick twists. The definition is really all diet though."
Brogress,21r54i,Unique-Name,1 point,Sun Mar 30 16:46:28 2014 UTC,What is the point in working core then if you can get lean enough to see your abs on just about anyone.
Brogress,21r54i,Unique-Name,5,Sun Mar 30 18:31:56 2014 UTC,I do abs for posing reasons. It help with the mind muscle connection of flexing your abs and obliques on stage.
Brogress,21r54i,onlysextoday,2,Sun Mar 30 18:34:43 2014 UTC,It doesn't make it actually any thicker?
Brogress,21r54i,Unique-Name,2,Sun Mar 30 18:43:49 2014 UTC,"If you train abs enough, they'll get thicker. They're just like any other muscle. I naturally have wide, bony hips so I want to do anything I can to make it as narrow as possible. So essentially, for me, it's just light weight pump work."

Brogress,21r54i,Badger_Storm,1 point,Sun Mar 30 21:26:03 2014 UTC,"The abs themselves get thinker/bigger/wider when you add weight into any ab exercise, There is a article I was reading by Arnold that said in order to get body builder abs only do high sets/reps but little to no weight to keep the waist as small as possible. I think it was in the new encyclopedia of bodybuilding."
Brogress,21r54i,TehWez,1 point,Mon Mar 31 01:29:57 2014 UTC,Isn't your waist/hip your bone structure? What can working Abs a certain way do with keeping your waist thin?
Brogress,21r54i,Pixelrag3,1 point,Mon Mar 31 02:55:57 2014 UTC,"He told me to do them at least once a week. I chose to do them so much. I do standing, seated, and donkey raises 3x12-30 reps. I wouldn't say it's a myth to grow calves, it's just really hard because you work them naturally every day by walking. I can notice a difference by doing this much volume."

Brogress,21o9oe,petthegoose,12,Sat Mar 29 15:02:36 2014 UTC,"For those interested:  I started lifting during the final few months of college last year due to looking so lanky and boredom.  I really enjoyed lifting and stuck with it with the goal of gaining 20 lbs, which then became another 20 lbs.  So far I've gained 42 lbs in one year, and I plan on gaining another 25 lbs this year.  Lifting Stats including bar:   Bench: 265 lbs Squat: 315 lbs dead: 375 lbs OHP: 150 lbs   Workout   Sunday: Rest Monday: Chest and Back Tuesday: Arms (Bis & Tris) Wednesday: Shoulders Thursday: Legs Friday: Max Out Saturday:  Stretch/Rest   Diet   I ate everything in site while trying to keep sugar low and protein high.  The toughest part was eating because I work 10 hour days and it's hard to eat during work and want to come home from work and the gym and want to cook for yourself.  I learned to just cook all my food for the week on Sunday and heat my meals up throughout the week.  Let me know if you have any advice on what I should focus on for the next year."
Brogress,21o9oe,minhhale,6,Sat Mar 29 15:10:36 2014 UTC,"Great progress man. When do you lift in the day? You said you work 10 hour, I imagine it must be pretty exhausting trying to lift after work."
Brogress,21o9oe,airyeezy91,7,Sat Mar 29 15:54:57 2014 UTC,"Thanks.  I lift immediately after work which is usually 4:30 and stay for a little over an hour.

Brogress,21o9oe,justcheeseandtrees,1 point,Sun Mar 30 08:56:34 2014 UTC,"I think the best thing is to just ignore the ""you'll get fat"" thing.  Working out burns a lot of calories to begin with and personally, I think it would be much easier to lose excess weight than put it on."

Only once I REALLY started focusing on progressing with each workout did I start seeing crazy gains. If you ever feel stuck sometimes you just have to throw some more weight on the bar and see what you can do. 200lbs is always going to feel like 200lbs until you do 300lbs.

An example of my ""chest day"" would be:  Flat Bench 5x5 or 5x3/7x3, etc.(I switch it up every few weeks) incline dumbbell fly 4x8-12 raises/flys for delts 4x10-15 close grip bench 3x6-8 skull crusher 3x8-12 push-ups and/or dips 3xFAILURE  As for my diet, I've been clean bulking for a year straight and I only track protein and calories. I hit at least 1g/lb. of bodyweight for protein and 3500-4000 calories and keep those calories as clean as is comfortable for me. My diet definitely isn't 100% clean but I try to keep it MOSTLY clean and use common sense. IIFYM  Hope this helps."

I am still doing the simple SS routine squat/bench/DL/chinups and squat/OHpress/DL/pullups.

Brogress,21kix4,zamgoesham,2,Fri Mar 28 14:38:16 2014 UTC,"It's an awesome feeling that I can motivate you. I feel your pain bro... I've always been tall but a part of me has always wanted more. I want to be BIG and tall. This past year has been a great first step to becoming that. When I started, for the first few months I was working out in a tiny apartment gym. No power rack, no bench, just a couple machines and a set of dumbbells up to 50lbs. Eventually I got a gym membership and started practicing the main lifts (squat, bench press, deadlift) I wasn't on any particular program. I would just do each lift twice a week along with some hypertrophy work. A few months ago I started throwing in some power sets for my main lifts (sets of 1-5 reps) and I noticed I was growing faster doing that, so I started basing my routine on strength and I've been doing that for the past couple months and it's working great. Once I hit a plateau I'm going to jump on a program like 5/3/1. SS is a good program. Remember, gains don't happen over night. Focus on progressing with your lifts (either improve form, move up in weight, or get more reps) and eating right. Over time you'll notice your body transforming. You have to think long term. I hope this helps."

If he was younger I would be defending him but I find it hard to believe in his nearly mid 40s he suddenly developed a models body. Also look at his delts. Very few people can genetically pull those off without help. If he isn't juicing he is an old prodigy.

Brogress,21c6tl,Whoa_Bundy,22,Tue Mar 25 18:00:25 2014 UTC,"Its been quite the trial and error process.  Early on I was focused on a lot of cardio, moderate weights, and strict diet.  In pic 3 I had crashed my diet....and hit a weight of 157# (pic 1 was around 193 pounds).  So that winter I put 17 pounds back on, and then SLOWLY took it back off.  Pic 4 is around 160 pounds.  Routine has varied a bit lately...but here is what I currently do (right or wrong):  1)  Run 3x a week at 5am.  Right now I'm running 4 miles at a time, but had been just at 3 miles for quite a while (gearing up for Tough Mudder).  I run M, W and F.  2)  Weights:  Mondays: Shoulders plus Bi/tri Tuesdays: Chest/back, and then legs in the evenings. Wednesday:  Nothing Thursday:  Bi/Tri Friday:  Shoulders Saturday:  Chest/Back Sunday:  Nothing  Diet had been all over the place.  I'm easing out of my cut and am now eating 2,500 cal a day.  25% in fats, around 180g in protein, the rest in carbs (works out to around 300ish).  Like I said, its varied a LOT in this time...I've done high protein, low carb, etc.  I feel my best right now with protein closer to body weight and carbs back on the menu.  In the meantime...cholesterol dropped 100 points, so even my doc is happy.  Foods are VERY clean.  Chicken, broccoli, spinach, eggs and egg whites, lots of veggies, greek yogurt, moderated drinking, etc.  I cheat once a week, but still try to fit it into my macros.  If it doesnt fit...fuck it, life is too short (but I get close)."

Brogress,21c6tl,radical01,3,Tue Mar 25 20:37:21 2014 UTC,"There's a little bit of variation depending on the day/mood...but generally speaking:  Mon:  Lateral, back and front raises with db's (10 back, 10 lateral, 10 front....no break in between).  Hammer curls.  Dips.  Overhead db press.  Reverse grip curls.  Triceps extension with rope handle.  Static curls (not sure what they're really called).  Triceps kickbacks with db's.  Tues:  DB bench.  Lat Pulls.  Shrugs.  Bent over db rows.  Bent over shrugs.  Incline bench.  DB lawnmowers.  DB deadlifts.  Springing pushups.  Tues night:  Squats.  Calf raises.  Leg extensions.  Leg curls.  Wed:  No weights.  Thurs:  Hammer curls.  Triceps press.  Weighted dips (ie, strap a 60-65# db to my ankle and do dips).  Hammer curl drop sets (sometimes).  Sometimes I'll work in Bulgarian squats and lunges.  (note...Thursday tends to have the most variation...depends on how I feel).  Fri:  Shoulders only (same as above).  Its a short break from the office.  Sat:  Bench (home on the Powertec machine).  Incline bench.  Low rows.  Deadlifts (with regular bar/weights).  (note, deadlifts dont always happen...but I'm trying to get more regular with them now.  I need to work on my back more).  Sun:  Nothing at all.  I might be missing things here and there....but the week day routines get me in/out of the gym in 50-60 minutes.  I will work in ab work on days as well....and tend to do those workouts circuit style, so I'm pretty gassed by the end.  Tuesday night doesn't take too long...nor does Saturday (by design since I'm home).  Earlier on, when I was still shedding the 30+ pounds, my routine was a bit different.  I worked out (I think) 4x a week...and 2 of those days were more hardcore circuit approaches that were (again, I think) around 30-45 minutes so that I could easily do them at night after the kids were asleep without having to be up till 10pm working out.  Any other questions...I'm happy to help."

When people ask the natural question they are usually wondering about the obtain-ability of a physique, and I honestly believe that anyone who put forth similar educated effort over the time period could craft a much superior physique than mine (since I did all training and diet alone).  Of course everyone's bodies, muscle insertions, and lives are unique so it's more about just crafting the best version of yourself."

Brogress,20ybys,grower89,5,Fri Mar 21 01:25:14 2014 UTC,My gym sessions can range from 45 minutes on sundays to up to 4 hours. I usually stop and talk with every person in my gym who has expressed interest even if it is simply inquiring about their weekend plans and sometimes it requires me to demonstrate different movements (with up to 40 people per day can get lengthy). I did a video on my training philosophy a while back and it is essentially my same views as today (though my knowledge and understanding has expanded since.)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxF-IQpK_gM&list=UUjc_rJWmhtF5SWvvE8GD01A
Brogress,20ybys,CBalls,1 point,Fri Mar 21 01:26:16 2014 UTC,"Interesting. Bit of a novice myself, but I totally get the feeling of just pushing the weight versus activating the muscle and making it work as hard/efficiently as possible. I guess I'll have to practice with some lighter weight until it clicks"
Brogress,20ybys,DorkmanScott,4,Fri Mar 21 03:23:03 2014 UTC,"Try a mixture of both! When you are starting out many people are not used to flexing specific muscles mentally and the only way to learn that at first is to get under weight with slow, controlled reps."

Anything specific you'd recommend?  I know they're made in the gym, revealed in the kitchen etc, but I'm curious about specifics.  Thanks."
Brogress,20ybys,ur2l8,5,Fri Mar 21 03:49:39 2014 UTC,"Initially all I cared about was abs. I just wanted abs, so I did them every day to failure with a routine where I did all the resistance machines in a 1 rep circuit. I also changed up my diet at the same time. Eventually I realized that they were becoming my most proficient muscle group and dropped em to twice a week, and now once a week. I can go months without isolating them and not notice a reduction in size now. Currently I fatigue lower abs first with leg raise variations then move to light decline sit ups and oblique work for like 10 mins."

Brogress,20vqax,two_tired,2,Thu Mar 20 07:00:20 2014 UTC,Calories have been pretty steady for the most part. I ate at a lower amount of calories right when I started and I know better now. So for like 11 months I have been eating 3500-4000. I think I may attempt a cut when I hit 190 though.
Brogress,20vqax,cazzles,2,Thu Mar 20 10:59:12 2014 UTC,Great progress. Can I suggest swapping in leg curls or stiff legged dead lifts in place of one of your four quad exercises? Maybe instead of leg press? Seems like the only thing you have hitting your hamstrings right now are the deadlifts.
Brogress,20vqax,nakedjay,2,Thu Mar 20 13:57:40 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the great suggestion, actually I am going to try swapping in leg curls tonight. I realize I've been a little quad obsessed lately :p"

Brogress,20mx94,thewoogier,2,Mon Mar 17 20:59:59 2014 UTC,Your bench seems really high compared to your squat and deadlift.
Brogress,20mx94,spacetug,1 point,Mon Mar 17 20:45:58 2014 UTC,I literally have the exact same numbers as him except my bench is 195. Never trained legs before I decided to get serious so once I started they've had a lot of catching up to do
Brogress,20mx94,randro,3,Mon Mar 17 21:53:38 2014 UTC,My lifts were about that in September. Now 185 bench and 290 squat. I look like a T-rex.

Brogress,20mx94,thewoogier,1 point,Tue Mar 18 01:08:40 2014 UTC,"6'1, ~170. 160ish in September. I should really bulk more aggressively, because my bodyfat continues to hover around 10-12%.  I started lifting about 13 months ago at 140 lbs, but slacked off over the summer. Probably could have had a 1/2/3/4 plate combo by now if I didn't do that."

Brogress,20mx94,theBANGster,1 point,Tue Mar 18 03:52:01 2014 UTC,"That's not a huge differential. The rough estimate is your bench should be body weight, and your squat should be 1.5 times your body weight so yours is about right."

It seems contradictory to want to ""increase strength and mass"" but call your ideal weight only 10lbs more than what you are currently.    Yes, you can gain a lot more weight and still be shredded. I know guys about that tall who are absolutely shredded at 190. We're talking about guys with VERY long training backgrounds (10 years or more) but if you're going for ideal, why not shoot high?"
Brogress,20n20e,Edgelessmuffin,1 point,Tue Mar 18 01:17:43 2014 UTC,I took your advice and pushed for a bulk. Currently 161. Pushing for 170 now. Thanks :)

Brogress,20n20e,Edgelessmuffin,5,Tue Aug 19 02:40:34 2014 UTC,The fact that your Bench 1RM is higher than your Squat 1RM with sleeves ...
Brogress,20n20e,Wtfox,4,Mon Mar 17 17:16:25 2014 UTC,The reason is because of this    Started squats August 2013. Correct form since November 2013.

Brogress,20n20e,Tarqon,2,Mon Mar 17 17:36:07 2014 UTC,"I was in a similar position. Could bench 225, but couldn't squat it. I started 5/3/1 on Jan 1st of this year and since then my bench orm is now 250 and my squat orm is 275. Point is, your larger muscle groups grow the quickest.

Brogress,20n20e,fusiformgyrus,2,Mon Mar 17 17:59:50 2014 UTC,"I'm very curious about what you say your goals are. What do you consider    ""ideal"" ectomorph aesthetics, physique and symmetry   and do you think you will be able to attain that at 155lbs?  Edit: Great work btw"
Brogress,20n20e,jpegfilms,2,Mon Mar 17 20:33:52 2014 UTC,"Hey. Ideal as in 1.618 ""Golden Proportion"". You have a point. I'm just tossing out words and I honestly don't know what I really want. The quote ""Once you start lifting, you'll always feel small"" is so true. I always feel like I could get bigger. I've tried eating more but I felt sick gorging myself. Will I attain and maintain 155? I think so but it'll take alot of work. I got to 152 but that was mostly water weight. Last time I got sick I dropped to 148."

Something I tell myself, that can help you here: you have NOTHING to be ashamed of. You're a 51 year old guy who is in better shape than .00001% of your age bracket, and probably in the top 2% of all American men of any age.   And something an ex-gf told me a long time ago that always stuck with me: You're perfect exactly the way you are, and yet there's still room for improvement.   By contrast, I've been training a few years - I have 7 inches in height on you, and 55 more pounds, but my arms will probably never look as full as yours, nor will my lower abs be as lean.

Brogress,20hhn2,Rerichael,7,Sat Mar 15 18:56:45 2014 UTC,I definitely feel like i couldve ate and done alot cleaner bulk. Def had some fat gains. But thanks!
Brogress,20hhn2,sellyourself,1 point,Sat Mar 15 19:43:38 2014 UTC,"one thing I've learned is that it's pretty fucking hard to have the ""perfect"" bulk, in terms of no ""I should have done this"" or ""I shouldn't have done that"" moments. Doubly so for the first bulk people do.  Even though you gained some fat- it happens- your size gains have been fantastic.  Don't worry about what you could have done, and focus on what you're going to do. If you accidentally give in to some chocolates or go out for a burger with friends, it won't kill your gainz. Just shrug it off, and push forward. It's why cheat days exist. Very few people are totally capable of sticking to a diet 100% of the time.  That being said, nice gainz brah. How tall are you?"

Brogress,20hhn2,LegalPirate,10,Mon Mar 17 06:37:12 2014 UTC,"I had a very dirty bulk and ate whatever whenever which included alot of whataburger haha. Im a hard gainer so what really helped me was that I took a mass gainer mixed with fruit, peanut butter, oats and cottage cheese(cant even taste) which alone was ~900 calaries. I took One post workout and before bed. If I thought I was getting too fat I would lower the scoops/serving size.   My routined involved mostly Push/pull/legs/rest (if I needed it). I felt better progress hitting each muscle group twice a week. Hypertrophy training of 3 sets of 10 of about 4 excercises per muscle group."

Wish I started sooner in comparison to the typical bro splits. I'm curious though did you take a rest day after the 3 days and repeat or did you just start over with push day? So either P/P/L rest P/P/L or P/P/L/P/P/L etc?  You mentioned lower down that during your 5 day split before you starting doing push/pull/legs that you did high volume and it was a big mistake, what kind if volume we talking about? Did you do lots more sets and keep reps between 6-8 or did you do normal amount of sets but increase the reps to 12-15 for example?  Which day did you work your core/abs? Could you go into a bit more detail on what you did for core/abs please? Sorry for a lot of questions, thanks in advance!"

Rinse repeat. Sometimes I only did one 3-day cycle per rest day, sometimes only two restdays per month.

Brogress,20gugv,MinkBass,-1,Sat Mar 15 07:11:44 2014 UTC,Do you see any small gain in my back from just a month of working out on a schedule? I'm obviously aware that a month won't do much when I'm starting out and need a lot more time to make gains.
Brogress,20gugv,faintryn,11,Sat Mar 15 07:21:04 2014 UTC,We can't see gains if we only have one photo
Brogress,20gugv,BakedBlowfish,1 point,Sat Mar 15 07:25:46 2014 UTC,"Actually, you're body (with proper diet) will experience a lot of growth within the first few months of training relative to the amount of gains you'd have after years of lifting. Bodybuilders would kill to gain like they use to when they first started."

I don't really count my calories or anything else besides protein grams (2g for every pound) and carbs being a diabetic."

Brogress,209kzy,morenr725,5,Thu Mar 13 02:42:45 2014 UTC,"during my gain I would do this workout in the order of upper - lower - upper - lower - arms and delts - rest.

Anyway, from the looks of it you got serious size. How are your proportions? Still just 21, you can continue putting on mass another 10 years atleast (although at a diminishing rate ofcourse). Would you consider competing?"
Brogress,209kzy,JGTHUNDERCOCK,1 point,Mon Mar 17 00:29:51 2014 UTC,"thanks, but really what I could work on more is my abs. they're lacking compared to the rest of me and I should really work them more especially while I'm putting on weight. and also my calves haha"
Brogress,209kzy,mkvgtired,3,Wed Mar 19 00:26:36 2014 UTC,"haha, calves are a bitch, and if they are genetically small, there is not a whole lot you can do. Been lifting for 9 years now, got pretty solid size myself, but just can seem to get big calves.  PS: abs are made in the kitchen. Sure, do abs, so when you cut down, you have some solid abs under there. But obviously, abs are mostly gained through getting ripped.  PPS: last general recommendations, as someone lifting for a long time and having done a lot of mistakes: make sure you either 1) bulk or 2) cut, (unless you are totally fine with how you look and dont wanna improve either way). You are not gonna make any progress either way, i.e. put on mass or get ripped, unless you consistently eat for the target you have in mind, i.e. bulk or cut. SO many guys go years without changing their physique due to this, this really is key. And a last couple of tips, dont be afraid of a little (HIIT) cardio, and vary the rep range from 3 till 15-20 reps. And dont think about changing up the training too much when cutting vs bulking (only increase cardio a little bit), mostly change the diet. Keep lifting heavy!  Anyways, looks like you have good genes and could get a great physique one day. Good luck to you!"

Brogress,204so6,Lenorien,26,Tue Mar 11 12:19:08 2014 UTC,You're selling yourself short by skipping squats and deadlifts. Your back will get stronger and will be less likely to be injured if  you work on deadlifts. Just master your form before doing anything heavy and then slowly progress. If anything do workouts that can substitute deadlifts and squats. Keep up the good work!
Brogress,204so6,Steak_Traps,-1,Tue Mar 11 13:58:53 2014 UTC,"Well my gym buddy and I always check each others backs, so form is not really the issue here. Both my brothers got spinal hernia from lifting and warned me about deadlifts and squats before. I felt some sharp pain in my leg when I squatted and got a little bit scared. But I'll definitely jump back into it again just not with really heavy weights . Thanks."
Brogress,204so6,GhostriderFlyBy,8,Tue Mar 11 18:39:01 2014 UTC,Both your brothers injured their spines from doing deads and squats incorrectly  FTFY
Brogress,204so6,airyeezy91,10,Wed Mar 12 02:55:07 2014 UTC,"Definitely don't skip squats or deads. Start light and work on form. I put my back out from over 4 months from a deadlifting injury. When I went back I dropped the weight for a few weeks and worked on form. 2yrs later and I've not so much as pulled a muscle. Seriously, deads and squats are king for adding mass and strength."
Brogress,204so6,ur2l8,3,Tue Mar 11 18:59:55 2014 UTC,"I started at 55 lbs for deadlift and squat, w/ some pretty bad problems. Now I'm at 155 for both, for reps. You can do it! Just start really small (like 55), get perfect form, and increase 5 lbs each week. then you'll be at 135 in 4 months."
Brogress,204so6,schutyser,2,Wed Mar 12 01:46:14 2014 UTC,I had spinal problems and they almost never come back up since I'm lifting.

With that said, keep it up and take the bull by the horns!  Squats and DLs are the best hormone producers in the body!  You don't have to go heavy -- just do the bar or just your own bodyweight until your body gets accustomed to the movement.  Then overtime, you'll get stronger and you can add 5lbs, then 10, then 20, then...    Source: I'm 5'6, 148 lbs, and I squat and DL twice a week heavy."

Brogress,203m1f,trppy,9,Wed Mar 19 03:21:05 2014 UTC,"Thanks dude. I'm around 6'7"", not totally sure. Workout is a pretty basic split - chest, shoulders, triceps, and abs. My ""B"" workout is back, biceps, sometimes abs. I try to hit around 3600 calories a day with at least 100g of protein. It's a pretty dirty bulk, I just try to hit my caloric goal by whatever means necessary.   Now for my confession - I haven't really worked legs into my routine. The reason being is my legs have always been disproportionately large compared to my upper body (which is why I was deceptively heavy when I was super skinny). My thighs are 25"" around, and I would say they are now proportionate to my upper body.   That being said, I added legs into my routine two weeks ago and currently at:  Dead lift - 335 x 5  Squats - 215 x 5  Upper body starting stats:  Bench press - 125 x 5  Dumbell shoulder press - 30lb dumbells x 6-8  Bent over row - 135 x 8-10  Pull ups - 65 pound resistance x 5-7  Current lifting stats:  Bench press - 205 x 5  Dumbell overhead press - 65lb dumbells x 6   Bent over row - 195 x 10  Pull ups - I can do 3 or 4 unassissted, but I'm currently doing 25lb resistance for sets of 6.

Brogress,203uz5,logathion,4,Wed Mar 12 19:08:12 2014 UTC,"What a load of shit. Gaining a lot of excess fat is just caused by not regulating your caloric intake. If you accurately calculate your TDEE, workout consistently, hit your protein macros, and eat slightly above maintenance, then you're bulking. Slowly. Cleanly.   I'm pretty sure the internet has moved past people with websites where you have to pay money for a workout plan."
Brogress,203uz5,ryizfly,0,Tue Mar 11 16:27:47 2014 UTC,"I don't disagree with anything you're saying... But at the time of my posting I didn't see anything referring to bulking ""cleanly"".  All I see and commonly see for guys like this is to ""eat more""... Which is probably the worst advice you could give someone who doesn't naturally rest at a lower body fat %  I would never recommend someone pay for advice on this (I didn't), but that site has tons of entries and videos talking about health and  the science behind gaining muscle for someone who's been failed by the brosience of ""dude just eat 4000 calories""  Just my two cents"
Brogress,203uz5,logathion,3,Tue Mar 11 20:18:18 2014 UTC,"The first three things I found on that site were typos. None of the information that is free on there is anything special, and I can pretty much garuntee that nothing you pay for is either.  He promises easy simple solutions to 'skinnyfat syndrome,' which isn't an actual thing.   Being 'skinnyfat' isn't something you're predisposed to, it's something that comes about as a result of a combination of poor-but-not-terrible diet and not enough exercise.   Cutting, bulking, recomping - all of these things revolve around caloric deficit/excess, and proper macro ratios. The only 'trick' is correctly calculating your individual needs.  ""eating more"" to bulk is correct, but so vague it's useless advice."

Brogress,1zqpxh,schutyser,3,Thu Mar 6 19:13:05 2014 UTC,"Started working out again 10 months ago, started out with some running and robe skipping. Just got out of a break up and a knee and back injury. Gained some kilo's because of being a lazy student.  Found Brazilian jiu jitsu, started out with 2/week and added going to the gym a month later. Started out with 3-4 months of Starting Strenght. Got my BJJ up to 3x/week and couldn't afford gym anymore so I went to body-weight excercises. Cutted down to 80kg for my first bjj competition. Won a fight, lost a fight => great experience. Started a (slow) bulk after and got a gym membership again. Did a 3 day full body routine but with squatting 1/week only (knee's to weak). I'm going in my second competition next week, a weight class higher though but I wanted to get somewhat bigger.  Advice, comments, jokes, questions ... Let them flow, my body is ready!"
Brogress,1zqpxh,new_land,2,Thu Mar 6 19:18:40 2014 UTC,"That's awesome, you've improved a lot. I'm thinking about doing starting strength soon. Do you take any protein supplements or any others? What was your diet like?"
Brogress,1zqpxh,BabyRaperMcMethLab,2,Thu Mar 6 20:25:20 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I started out the first moment with just cutting out the obvious stuff and concentrated on working out (imo don't make the jump to big, get used to going to the gym and enjoy the fuck out of it. BJJ helped me a lot with this because I could 'lose' myself in it).  That made me go from 86 to 82,5. To lose the last 2,5kg I started counting calories (myFitnesspal) and stopped drinking for 1 months.  Stopping drinking made this so easy but I love my beer and my whisky to much to quit forever ;)  Starting strength was really helpful to start out and get used to all the big exercises, go for it.

Does lacrosse have weight requirements?"
Brogress,1zoz5k,Cthulu2013,2,Thu Mar 6 15:04:51 2014 UTC,"Really, my point is that I'll be so active with running around in lacrosse that I can lose the fat quickly. I will be eating at maintenance and still lifting, and honestly I want a six pack for summer."
Brogress,1zoz5k,A_Light_Spark,-1,Thu Mar 6 19:03:41 2014 UTC,"Ok, you'll lose fat. You still need calories. And lots of them. Eating a caloric deficit is not going to be helpful to you in the coming months."

Brogress,1zm7w9,fannymcslap,14,Wed Mar 5 13:10:19 2014 UTC,"Cheers!   I mainly preform compound exercises.  Legs days would be - Squats several pyramid sets (maybe up to 6 or 7) until they are hammered, then I move onto some straight leg dead-lifts (4-5 sets of 8-12) and some calf work to finish (4 sets of high reps).   Back and Biceps Day - Deadlifts - 4-5 pyramid sets, the heaviest being my 1rep max. pull ups - 4 sets till failure, rows 4 sets of 8-12, and some general bicep work (either reverse grip curls or preacher curls).   Chest and Tri's Day - Bench press 4-5 pyramid sets, incline dumbbells - 4 sets of 8-12, machine flys, dips till failure and pull downs (i choose a weight that I can do 10-15 of, and do 4 sets till failure).   Shoulders and traps Day - Military press 4-5 pyramid sets, Arnold press, lateral raises, front raises, and power shrugs.   My diets is pretty much unchanged. a regular day would be muesli + milk for breakfast (7am), protein, oats and creatine chake about 10:30, lunch would be something like tuna and jacket potato or chicken and rice, and dinner would be something like chili con carne, curry and rice or fish pie. Not sure if I'm hitting all of the macros but I am not too strict on my diet. I dont have issues putting on weight when I want to so this seems ot aid me in a slow bulk..."

Finding the ideal diet, the ideal calorie intake, takes some trial and error, and obviously you need some extra fuel, but the whole ""eat until you're full, and then keep eating, and then wait an hour and do it again! GOMAD4LYFE!"" is fucking ridiculous and unnecessary. Glad you saw the light."

I picked up Starting Strength  and 5/3/1 and other broscience information, and I was told to eat a lot -- I did and I blew up as seen in my July pic.  Bad Idea.  I got frustrated.  I decided to just do my own thing and keep things simple.  In Oct 2013, I decided to do 2 splits: upper and lower with focus on compound movements (If there's anything common about books/articles/broscience, they all agree that you get more bang from compound movements).  My lifting stats. I kept track of them starting Oct, and I never did 1 rep maxes.  I would do 3 sets for each, and below are the stats of the 1st sets.   Squats: 190x6 (Oct 2013) →  225x6 (Mar 2014) Deads: 215x6 → 265x3 Barbell Bench: 140x8 →  Single-Arm DB Bench: 65x10 [switched due to shoulder injury] OHP: 95x7 → 115x6   Diet. Calories is somewhere between 1900 to 2700 depending how hungry and active I am on that day.  I ensured that I have at least 175g of protein. Fats is around 100g.  I varied my carbs greatly since it was the easiest to manipulate.   Weight. I just looked at my log and in Nov, I was 147lbs.  This morning (March 1st), I weighed 145lbs.  :/  My guess is that the gained muscles offset the lost fats; hence, the weight is relatively the same.  Conclusion. After posting this and looking at my numbers, I think I could have pushed my lifts more.   :/    Looking forward to the next 6 months of progress!"
Brogress,1zazdd,JB52,3,Sun Mar 2 00:00:08 2014 UTC,I was told to eat a lot -- I did and I blew up as seen in my July pic   I'm curious - How many calories?

Brogress,1zazdd,James_Dalton,1 point,Sun Mar 2 00:30:35 2014 UTC,What kind of shoulder injury did you have that made you switch to DB bench? I switched due to a pec/shoulder issue as well so I'm just wondering.
Brogress,1zazdd,timshundo,2,Thu Mar 6 21:19:01 2014 UTC,tendinitis (based from a doctor who half-assed the XRay assessment bcoz he didn't want to give me an MRI).
Brogress,1zazdd,usmcplz,2,Thu Mar 6 22:48:31 2014 UTC,Did you ever do any rehab for it? What did you do to make it better?
Brogress,1zazdd,usmcplz,3,Fri Mar 7 02:54:27 2014 UTC,"I never went to rehab for it, but I did (and still do) daily stretching every morning.     I used all the 3 shoulder stretches from this link.   These are passive stretching.  I remember the first several days when I did the Rear Hand Clasp (with a towel), it was pretty painful -- (the good painful kind).  As if my muscle was really stiff after it recovered from the injury. I've also started doing a set of really slow diamond push-ups (8 to 10 reps)  which I consider active stretching.  By really slow I mean 2 second up, 2 second down, and 2 second pause.   I did diamond because it uses the triceps more, so less pressure on the shoulder whilst it still gets some work. Yep, every morning. And on a more infrequent note, Rubber Band stretches.  I did a few whenever I would be at the gym because they have the equipment.  But this wasn't as consistent as the first two above.     Good luck!"
Brogress,1zazdd,usmcplz,2,Fri Mar 7 05:25:12 2014 UTC,Thanks for the help! I definitely need to stretch more and on a consistent basis. Any plans on switching back to barbell bench or will you stick with dumbbells for awhile? I'm curious how you are able to overhead press with a barbell but cannot bench with a barbell.
Brogress,1zazdd,usmcplz,3,Fri Mar 7 13:47:53 2014 UTC,"The pain happens to me at the bottom of the barbell bench (when my elbow goes beyond my back).  For an OHP Barbell, the elbow should always be in front of the body (and the bar) in the bottom position; hence, the position differs."

Brogress,1zazdd,highflyflow,1 point,Fri Mar 7 17:41:40 2014 UTC,"Just wanted to throw in my advice about the bicep tendonitis. More than likely what you're experiencing. I had the exact same pain when benching last fall and then while rotating my arm (pain was in right arm). I talked to my mom (physician) and she diagnosed it as bicep tendonitis. I then talked to a buddy of mine who is an athletic trainer and he put it very clear to me, he asked what training I was doing and at the time, it was SS then 531. I never did any bicep work or tricep work, just pushed the main lifts. He suggested strengthening my biceps/triceps. I did it and after 3 months I started benching again. I'm back up to benching my previous pre-injury weights. My shoulder feels much stronger/tighter.   I did biceps twice a week 4 exercises each time. Sets were 3-5. Reps 10-20. Just wanted to share my experience and what helped me get through it. Best of luck and also great work on your progress!"
Brogress,1zazdd,highflyflow,2,Mon Mar 10 01:59:11 2014 UTC,Thanks for the insight!  I'll experiment and increase bicep work then.  What exercises do you do?  And what is your favorite?

Brogress,1zazdd,CraftyMuthafucka,2,Sun Mar 2 05:03:10 2014 UTC,"You have to start from a beginner level then you move up a level once you've developed enough strength (we call this progression).  Check out this post I made a while back about the progression.  EDIT: as far as reps/sets, I would do 2 or 3 sets pushing it to as many reps as I could (usually ending around 7).

Brogress,1z7zyh,sesquipedalian22,14,Mon Mar 3 16:43:26 2014 UTC,Bad ass! What was your training/diet like over that time and what is it currently? Awesome  transformation!!
Brogress,1z7zyh,sesquipedalian22,24,Mon Mar 3 23:35:29 2014 UTC,"So at the very beginning I was not doing anything physical beyond playing a lot of beer pong and walking up and down a giant hill each day on campus to get to my classes. I was a ""vegetarian,"" which is to say I subsisted on Cheerios, elbow macaroni, and PBR for a couple of years.   Once I started going to the gym at all, I was putting in 20-40 minutes on the elliptical or rowing machine 3 days per week, and soon after I started that I began taking a yoga class, first once a week, then twice a week. I added chicken and fish back into my diet and restricted my carbs, without counting calories or macros. I just started trying to be more conscious of the things I was consuming. That's what got me to the point where I was in the blue dress.   My boyfriend then started to encourage me to do some lifting. I spent a couple of days looking through plans on bodybuilding.com and found one I liked made by Jaimie Eason and began doing that, I believe it was 3 or 4 days per week: a pull day, a push day, a cardio day when I would do rowing, and a leg day. Nothing super heavy, mostly machines, but it got me lifting anyhow. I remember being so proud when I leg pressed my own bodyweight a couple of weeks into that program. I used that program, in combination with my continued twice weekly yoga classes, to get to the third picture with the me-sized palm tree. I was probably 125 pounds in that photo, and approximately 20-22% body fat. I started gravitating a bit more towards heavier weights and free weights around that time as well. I made it a goal to do 3 pull-ups, and began working on that every day. I started really focusing on making sure I was getting adequate protein, so I'd have a protein shake and a turkey sandwich after class rather than a bowl of cereal. Making smaller diet changes like that. I stocked my freezer with frozen veggies and flash frozen chicken breasts and tilapia fillets for easy dinners, and started learning how to make things taste good with spices.   A few months after that photo, I fell in love with powerlifting. I was unemployed and had loads of time to research between applying for jobs, so I made it my mission to learn as much about fitness and nutrition as I could. I read everything the internet could provide me with. I started cooking a lot, making a lot of healthier substitutions, signed up for a CSA and began focusing on lean meats and lots and lots of veggies on my plate. I was making huge gains on my lifts and couldn't keep myself OUT of the gym most of the time, I was completely hooked. The first time I pulled a 205 deadlift I cried, I was so excited. I started on 5/3/1 and loved the gains I was making. As I lifted and progressed, I kept on learning, kept on reading, an decided to try out Leangains-style intermittent fasting. I started counting my calories and macros, and I started to see my body changing shape. Once you see that muscle separation begin on the outside of your thigh, that's it, it's game on.   So now I spend a lot of time in the kitchen. I LOVE to cook, and I love that my diet (still doing Leangains, carb cycling) allows me to eat most things. I never feel deprived or hungry or like there's something I can't have. If I want pizza or takeout pad Thai, or a glass of wine, or a night of margaritas with friends, I make sure it generally fits into my macros for the day. I don't really eat foods that come in packages, and if I do, I keep the ingredient lists minimal. There's no excuse for eating fake foods, and my body works better without. The most processed food I eat regularly is my whey protein, I guess. My current calorie intake is 1605, maintenance, and I make sure to hit 112g protein each day, and on rest days 75% of the rest of my calories come from fats and 25% from carbs, and on lifting days I reverse the two so it's 75% carb/25% fats.   I lift 4-5 days per week, currently on a plan of my own making, with each day focusing on a big lift, usually 8 sets of 1-5 depending on how heavy I'm going, then 3 accessory lifts on each day. Day 5 is a purely accessory day, though my ""big lift"" for the day is barbell glute bridge- trying to build up these flutes! I try to still do yoga at least a couple hours a month, but I'm no longer attending classes."

Once I started powerlifting my body naturally went to 117-118. I only started considering competing in the past 8 or 9 months, and I was ok with lifting in the 123 weight class. Once I realized I could get into the 114 weight class without compromising strength, I decided to start a real cut, and that must have been around June of last year. I wasn't particularly consistent on it, though. I would get tired of it and gain everything back for a couple of weeks before getting mad at myself and starting tracking my calories again. I've maintained 111-114 now, though, since December, and my body seems to have accepted this as my new ""normal."""

I used to be crazy strict about it, but I'm a bit more relaxed now. Generally I eat when I get home from work, between 1400 and 1600, and I go to bed between 2200 and 2300, so that's my eating window I suppose. Normally I just do 8 hours. And honestly, I'm not going to turn down a night out with friends a couple times a month just because I might have a margarita around midnight, or turn down brunch once a month because friends want to meet up at 1030 or something. But my day-to-day eating window runs those times. It's mostly just because it's really convenient for my life- I don't have to pack lunches and stuff, or get up earlier to make breakfast."

Brogress,1z7zyh,thesorrow312,5,Sat Mar 1 00:44:43 2014 UTC,"Tough contest between ""what a dick"" and ""what a good point""! Have you ever considered competing? Or maybe you do already"
Brogress,1z7zyh,GintaA,5,Sat Mar 1 21:01:32 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that comment could have gone really differently for him. I ended up marrying him anyhow- I credit him with getting me on the right track. Things could have gone horribly, horribly wrong for my life if I had continued on the path I was on.   I have considered competing, but haven't taken any steps to do so, yet. The problem with competing on the stage is that it cuts into your lifts- even the photo shoot that the bottom photo came from, I only prepped for 3.5 days and I felt so weak and small, and it took a little over a week week to get my lifts figured back out. I think I'm signing up for a powerlifting meet this month, but after that, I may reconsider doing a figure competition."
Brogress,1z7zyh,SceretAznMan,5,Sat Mar 1 22:24:37 2014 UTC,"Reason I ask is that I'm a competitor, and I'm at a local INBA show right now, and you look a hell of a lot better than all the girls on stage right now."

So we have pretty similar stats, and hopefully you can shed some more light on your progress, in addition to your very detailed diet and workout plan.  I'm 5'2"" as well and weigh around 145 with a curvier figure (larger bust and hips) I don't feel like I have that much extra pudge on me, but I do have a lot of cellulite on my legs and butt, which is my main motivation to get in better shape. What point in your exercise plan were you about 145?   Currently I already eat really well, but then I binge on sugary junk food 1 or 2 times a week. I rock climb 1 to 3 times a week, and and have a pretty active lifestyle (move around a lot at work, exercise my dog every day). Obviously with that binge eating aside, what would you recommend would be my next step?   Edit Also, love the hair in the most recent pic!"

It leads me to believe it's just the photo which makes him look deceivingly large. When you're drained of water + lowbodyfat, bending over flexing it makes you look a-lot bigger than you actually are on camera. And I know vascularity with a little bit of muscle makes you guys go crazy.   Until we know his measurements I think it's very silly to assume he's on gear, emphasizing on the fact he's only 175....   And just to add, he looks very '' dry '' like you guys always say is a sign of being natty, maby only when you think it's convenient, though."

For different heights 175 may be huge.   edit : Those pictures were two years old, if you were lifting and eating constantly from that point you should undoubtedly be passed that.  Maby go on /r/fitness and ask some questions, get a lifting routine and start bulking up, or maby you fell off the wagon and have to cut a bit of fat."

(+400-500 calories per day should keep you from gaining too much body fat if you care.) Track your calories with my fitness pal. Make sure your daily protein equals about .9g for every pound you weigh. (ie: you should be getting about  135g of protein per day right now).

Brogress,1z15ny,Berxerk94,2,Thu Feb 27 00:49:10 2014 UTC,"When starting off as a rookie, start with compound movements mainly to build a solid foundation before starting to focus on specific muscle parts in individual days.  Compound movements:   Deadlift (MUST use correct form otherwise can cause injury, youtube correct deadlift form) Dip Squat Bench   IMPORTANT - Use a simple weight with all excercises and hit around 8-12 reps, but do not increase the weight dramatically until you have PERFECTED the form of each movement. (I'm not sure if overhead press is classes as a compound movement or not, but bench and dip hit the shoulders hard enough for a beginner)  These are the 4 main exercises and if you want to build a solid foundation, include these in your workouts. A great youtuber who I follow is Elliothulse.  Here are a few workouts that are perfect for starting fresh.   Deadlift 3-6 Sets / Dip 3-6 Sets / 2 sets of pushups/sit ups until failure. Squat 3-6 Sets / Bench 3 -6 Sets / 2 sets of pushups/sit ups until failure   Alternate these workouts, here is a simple programme that will be highly beneficial.  Monday - Deadlift / Dip  Wednesday - Work out body parts that aren't hit hard with these 4      exercises, Calves/Biceps/Traps  Friday - Squat / Bench  After building a solid foundation, over the 6-8weeks watch videos of youtubers, whatever you do STAY AWAY FROM MIKE CHANG HE IS BULLSHIT."
Brogress,1z15ny,Billytown,1 point,Wed Mar 5 19:49:34 2014 UTC,"Pick a program and follow it. TO THE LETTER. The only reason to not do a prescribed lift is if you have a physical injury or malformation that prevents you from doing it. Popular choices are Starting Strength, Strong Lifts 5x5, Greyskull LP. I recommend Greyskull, and you want it handed to you, here's a good variation for you: Phrak's Greyskull Variant. Google the other ones if you want.  That out of the way, here are the basic principles:   Lift the big lifts (bench press, overhead press, squat, deadlift, rows, and also do chin ups and pull ups)  Add weight to your lifts each time. Reset according to the programming you go with. (Linear progression) Eat more than you need to or you won't build mass. Get enough protein (.8g per lb of bodyweight). If you're nutrition dumb, you'll probably want to use MyFitnessPal app to track your food. It's a bit of a pain at first, but so are lots of things, and this is something you want, so just do it. Just eat lots of things like sandwiches, rice, chicken, vegetables, Greek yogurt, oats. Good food, lots of it.  Be consistent. You won't see gains for a while. Maybe quite a while, especially if you don't eat enough. It'll be maybe 3 months before you start to notice, and maybe 6 or more months before anyone else notices, so understand that it's a very long game.  Get enough sleep.   Do these things, and gains will come."

Forcing myself to eat more food or maintain a strict diet is just not enjoyable. I'd rather be able to eat what I want and not worry too much about it. Also I really love cardio and I know that for a proper bulk you need to either cut out cardio or minimize it. Neither was a choice I was willing to make.

Your perspective on food needs to be updated to meet reality. Oh, a guy like you can probably get pretty far eating whatever you want (within reason -- too much sugar is generally not a good idea). BUT... you're still not going to be eating enough, because you need to work against your natural appetite limits.   Forcing myself to eat when I'm not hungry isn't really fun. But if you really want quality mass, bigger muscles, a better physique, and serious strength, get the fuck over it man. It's part of what you have to do.  I finished dinner an hour ago. I had a chicken breast stuffed with cheese and broccoli, a big ass bowl of turkey sausage and lentil soup (home made, slow cooker), and four pieces of buttered Italian bread. In another hour I'm going to have another dinner, probably some beef and pasta casserole I made a few days ago. I won't be hungry, but oh well. I like the way I look and the mass I've put on much more than I dislike having to force myself to eat.   Unless you get the right mindset, you may as well not even start, because you'll surely fail. You need to be all in or you're all out, there's nothing in between.  Edit: Holy shit I got this thread completely confused with another one from the kid who wants to gain mass and get a premade diet and program. In this context, what follows makes me sound like a major douche. I'm gonna let is stand though"
Brogress,1yyujj,ScottyBiscotti,1 point,Thu Feb 27 00:50:19 2014 UTC,I was the same weight/height you were after highschool and I'm coming up on 205 now. Everything you said is totally true.

Brogress,1yyujj,airyeezy91,6,Tue Mar 4 21:17:37 2014 UTC,"I highly doubt you have an extremely high metabolism.  The difference between a fast one and slow one is about 200 calories.  A lot of skinny people think their bodies are in overdrive all the time, but you clearly do so much damn cardio that everything burns right off plus I can imagine you're not cramming many calories either."
Brogress,1yyujj,uberBored,-5,Thu Feb 27 01:17:42 2014 UTC,"As both a reply to citre and Billytown I used to eat like a fucking whore. Like go out and get poutine at the bar twice a week, eat dessert and drink beer and all that jazz. I'm pretty sure I have a big appetite. Many of my bros who are much bigger than me will eat less or about the same as me. My point being I used to eat a ton of crap and did very minimal cardio and never got fat. Billytown again I have to mention that I'm not invested in this fitness for bulking. I'm happy being lean and fairly tone. I do realize my gains will taper out but that's fine. I refuse to diet. I follow my body's natural hunger. When I workout more I get hungrier, so I eat more. Many a night I've had a midnight bowl of vector."
Brogress,1yyujj,ScottyBiscotti,7,Thu Feb 27 04:15:11 2014 UTC,Eating junk food twice a week doesn't tell shit about how much calories you consume on average.
Brogress,1yyujj,ScottyBiscotti,5,Sat Mar 1 15:25:59 2014 UTC,"There's no such thing as a high metabolism. 6'3"" and formally 140 here. Just eat. Keep eating."
Brogress,1yyujj,Schmedes,6,Mon Mar 3 10:28:49 2014 UTC,"Whoa, can you give your diet plan and workout? I am built very similarly to you and I am envious of your progress. Looks great!"
Brogress,1yyujj,jamoseke,0,Wed Feb 26 08:10:35 2014 UTC,Here is the thing with the diet. I didn't really do it. I tried to eat healthy but I didn't count calories or keep a strict regime. I wanted to eat a cinnamon bun with my coffee? Heck yes I ate it. I eat vector every morning and try to make sure I have some almonds as well. Additionally I take a multi vitamin and a fish oil. Just eat in moderation. I'll get a pic of the workout exercises in a bit.
Brogress,1yyujj,ScottyBiscotti,9,Wed Feb 26 15:10:55 2014 UTC,dude- you're 6'3. You need to bulk.
Brogress,1yyujj,ScottyBiscotti,-3,Thu Feb 27 00:07:45 2014 UTC,There's a pic of my average workout for a week. I just rotate around the exercises depending on my focus for that week.
Brogress,1yyujj,uberBored,3,Wed Feb 26 15:19:14 2014 UTC,"Do you do anything for legs other than running? And you may want to start keeping track of weights for those lifts, that way you can track progress. If you're serious about putting on muscle, adding some actual lifting will help a ton. But if you're satisfied with your results, more power to you."
Brogress,1yyujj,uberBored,-2,Wed Mar 5 19:09:14 2014 UTC,I keep track of my weights. I don't currently do anything for legs. I still play soccer + run frequently so I'm not worried about my legs.
Brogress,1yyujj,Penguins_Are_Funny,3,Wed Mar 5 19:12:51 2014 UTC,"Something worth thinking about: squats and deadlifts do wonders for speed development. If you want to get faster, they're an awesome tool to add to your lifting toolbox. I ran everyday all through high school and now only do it a few times a week. My 400m time has dropped significantly from high school though, solely through lifting heavy."

Brogress,1yx2n1,Gr33d007,2,Wed Feb 26 00:33:01 2014 UTC,"I would say the major change was no carbs at dinner, I was always rice or potato with my meal! Mostly had stir fry meat and a lot of green veg, capsicum, cauli during the 12 weeks. Cut alcohol out mostly with the occasional beer and wine, and high intensity interval training after heavy weights five days a week during the first six weeks of the then just lots of lifting! Good luck for your cut."

Brogress,1yuooq,Rerichael,3,Tue Feb 25 06:01:22 2014 UTC,None at all.  Starting stats:  Squat: 115x5 Deadlift: 135x5 Bench: 75x5 OHP: 65x5
Brogress,1yuooq,hakujin214,2,Tue Feb 25 06:06:01 2014 UTC,Good fucking shit.  Are your goals more strength or aesthetic?
Brogress,1yuooq,summerswag,2,Tue Feb 25 06:19:19 2014 UTC,"I'm going completely for strength. Hoping to compete in powerlifting as soon as possible.  So far it's only been strength routines, so I'm going to try a push/pull/legs routine to put on size to see if it helps with the strength."
Brogress,1yuooq,hakujin214,3,Tue Feb 25 06:23:57 2014 UTC,"Definitely compete before you turn 18. Hell, you could probably set some records in 18-19 Juniors, but 16-17s is pretty much guaranteed if you cut down to 165s.  Edit: The American record for 16-17 Juniors 165 weight class for squat is 418.87 (doable depending on your timeframe) and 462.97 for deadlift (probably the most likely)."
Brogress,1yuooq,hakujin214,2,Tue Feb 25 09:26:43 2014 UTC,This would be achievable given he has enough time. I'd go for it dude.
Brogress,1yuooq,Rerichael,2,Tue Feb 25 10:52:31 2014 UTC,Oh damn I had no clue I was so close! I turn 18 in about a month though. If only I would've started several months earlier.
Brogress,1yuooq,Zephyrv,2,Tue Feb 25 14:22:07 2014 UTC,"Well it turns out the records at 18-19s are a little easier (it happens sometimes). According to the spreadsheet on the USPA page, the squat record for raw 18-19 Juniors 165.2 lbs is 396.83 lbs and the deadlift is 490.53 lbs. Deadlift will be a little harder to get, but your squat is already there, provided someone else doesn't break it before you compete. There are state records, too, which would probably be even easier to set for you."

Is there a warmup of lighter weights beforehand and this is the main part of the routine? Well done with the gains man, I'm hoping to try and push for some similar progress over the next few months but it's going slower than I had hoped."
Brogress,1yuooq,Guitarman34,2,Tue Feb 25 20:28:37 2014 UTC,"It means I could only do 115lbs for 5 reps, and not a single more. I would warm up before this."

I thought I'd need some more time cutting although if I was to bulk currently at about 2700cals per day, so a little over maintenance I should put on mostly muscle with a bit of fat right?

Brogress,1ycpg5,rexregnum,5,Wed Feb 19 18:28:03 2014 UTC,Wow. This was done with mostly body-weight exercises? Good job man!
Brogress,1ycpg5,baba192,0,Wed Feb 19 17:16:59 2014 UTC,I mix weight training with bodyweight exercises.  Its all about the resistance and the muscle contraction. ie if you can do dips pretty easy try adding extra weight.
Brogress,1ybxhk,BroDudeSwaggins,28,Wed Feb 19 09:50:17 2014 UTC,"No offense brah but you didn't need to tell us you're natty.  Mirin the deepness of your abdominal gap, your aesthetic arm vein wasn't in your second picture which is a shame.  Your adonis belt is really thick and nice,  i'm mirin that, looking real nice. I see you've gained some thickness on spot of your ribs, lookin like you made some gains so you look less bony. Mirin heart face, have a real good thickness and curve at the top like a nice buttcheek spread apart, a real sense of fullness, the pink color is a good indicator of health, a little to dark red and you might be lookin at high-blood pressure and cholesterol.   edit : biting your nails aint good for you, that's a bad habit    Good progress overall though."
Brogress,1ybxhk,BabyRaperMcMethLab,3,Wed Feb 19 11:23:13 2014 UTC,"Thanks brah <3  Lol I figured might as well put Natty in the tag even if it is blatantly obvious to anyone who's been lifting for awhile. That way potential lurkers and bros can see what kinds of gains are attainable natty within a certain time period.  I naturally have a pretty large/strong core so honestly I've only done maybe 2 or 3 ab workouts since I began, trying to stay away from rectangle mode. I'll probably throw in leg raises and incline crunches somewhere down the line though."

Brogress,1ybxhk,timesnewboston,1 point,Wed Feb 19 17:43:31 2014 UTC,"They're the gear settings on a bike. 52 teeth on the front cog and on the back, 12 teeth, pretty standard settings on a road bike since if you're strong enough you can sprint upwards of 40+mph. It's the highest resistance you can get on my particular road bike at least. If you want to add some more fun climb up a slight hill in those settings and your quads will basically want to give up on you all the way up. :)"

Brogress,1ya2nx,stanleythemanley44,4,Tue Feb 18 23:12:20 2014 UTC,"If your program does not have compound lifts, add them. You are making nice progress and compounds will help you further."
Brogress,1ya2nx,applesauce42,9,Tue Feb 18 23:51:40 2014 UTC,"Why should he add compounds? Just wondering. He has amazing progress for 5 months. Assuming his goal is aesthetics over strength, then what would be the point?"
Brogress,1ya2nx,stanleythemanley44,5,Wed Feb 19 00:40:13 2014 UTC,Because compounds are the foundation to fitness.
Brogress,1ya2nx,applesauce42,-2,Wed Feb 19 01:16:10 2014 UTC,"In your opinion, yes."
Brogress,1ya2nx,tutae,13,Wed Feb 19 03:09:55 2014 UTC,"In anyone reputable's opinion, yes. Squat, deadlift, and bench are core components that should be the foundation for anyone looking to get fit through weight lifting. By just getting those three down you'll be in good shape, and combining them with isometric movements is the icing on the cake. You will see much more muscle growth and better body composure by doing compounds first, rather then going straight to isometric because compound works a multitude of muscles at the same time, creating a strong working body. Isometrics will not do that."
Brogress,1ya2nx,hakujin214,-1,Wed Feb 19 03:23:05 2014 UTC,"It depends on his goals. For strength, most certainly. But doing compounds isn't always a great idea when you're on a 5-day split."

Brogress,1ya2nx,hakujin214,1 point,Wed Feb 19 18:02:18 2014 UTC,"I didn't say it doesn't work. I said it's not always a good idea. It depends on the split and volume.  5-day splits isolate muscle groups. Incorporating compounds on some splits will lead to working out muscles on consecutive days, resulting in an inadequate recovery period."
Brogress,1ya2nx,Cthulu2013,1 point,Wed Feb 19 09:43:18 2014 UTC,"If you're doing the same muscle groups on consecutive days, then you're doing it wrong. Squat/Upper/Deadlift/Upper/Squat is a perfectly viable split with little to no overlap."

Brogress,1ya2nx,stiffy_,-8,Wed Feb 19 11:14:49 2014 UTC,"Compounds increase production of testosterone and growth hormone more than isolation exercises. Also, actually being strong as opposed to only looking strong never hurts."
Brogress,1ya2nx,stanleythemanley44,8,Wed Feb 19 00:42:37 2014 UTC,I always had a slight issue with that last saying.  Its not like aesthetic training guys who look strong have no strength difference over someone who doesn't lift at all. Its not like that guy who lifts to have a beach body has muscles made from air.
Brogress,1ya2nx,dssssd,5,Wed Feb 19 02:30:02 2014 UTC,"I totally agree. I know guys that do split routines that Reddit would call ""bs fluff"" routines and they can still lift a lot too."
Brogress,1ya2nx,stanleythemanley44,3,Wed Feb 19 03:07:32 2014 UTC,"Compounds increase production of testosterone and growth hormone more than isolation exercises.   While that may be the case, it increases those levels at such a small amount it won't have any effect on how he grows.  EDIT: Also, that program does have compounds in it."
Brogress,1ya2nx,dssssd,2,Wed Feb 19 03:08:57 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the answer. I never see anyone actually say why they are better, and it just bugs me.  Also I would say that people that don't do compounds are still probably pretty strong. It seems to me like there's no really good reason to do compounds if it doesn't match your goals. But that's just one man's opinion."
Brogress,1ya2nx,airyeezy91,0,Wed Feb 19 03:09:45 2014 UTC,Implying compounds don't make you aesthetic
Brogress,1ya2nx,tutae,2,Sat Feb 22 20:23:06 2014 UTC,"Nope. I implied a split would make you less strong. If all he wants is aesthetics, which he has been achieving with the routine he is on, why learn a bunch of extra lifts?"
Brogress,1ya2nx,airyeezy91,-1,Sat Feb 22 20:34:30 2014 UTC,The point is compounds will improve his aesthetics
Brogress,1ya2nx,tutae,-1,Sat Feb 22 22:02:56 2014 UTC,Compounds are the building blocks of weight training. Leaving them out is nothing short of stupid (unless you have a medical reason)
Brogress,1ya2nx,airyeezy91,0,Wed Feb 19 12:14:28 2014 UTC,"If strength training is your goal, then yes. For BBing it's advantageous, but not absolutely necessary. An example at the highest level would be 6x Mr. O Dorian Yates, who never barbell squatted."
Brogress,1ya2nx,DontNeedNoThneed,4,Wed Feb 19 13:10:57 2014 UTC,He was on serious amounts of gear though so it's not a valid comparison. Many pro BBs don't squat.

Brogress,1ya2nx,superphotonerd,2,Wed Feb 19 14:03:28 2014 UTC,I never even insinuated that so I have no idea where you're getting that from?  I said you can't compare someone who trains on gear to someone who's natty.

Brogress,1y3bjy,TheIslander829,7,Sun Feb 16 23:43:36 2014 UTC,"To be fair the diet and supplements are a pretty obvious scam. 6-7 different supplements? 6 scoops of protein powder a day? I'm not surprised that guy got ripped up. You need to think for yourself and not just blindly follow everything you see. The diet is just kind of a cover up for it which is why I hate it. All I took for supplements was protein powder, multi and fish oils.   I shouldn't say the workout the way it was was great I should say the way I customized it worked well for me. Some of it is pretty ridiculous as is. I put in more rest and subbed in workouts that worked well for me. I liked how I felt after the workouts and I got good results so I shouldn't talk too much shit about it.   I would give the entire program itself like a 5 or 6/10. Take out the diet and customize it a little and it goes to 8/10. I liked it but hey what works for me might not work for everyone else."

Brogress,1y3bjy,NewLineCinema,3,Sun Feb 16 23:29:24 2014 UTC,Lifted for baseball a few years ago. Also took some weight training classes but never took it seriously. The first picture in August is when I got my gym membership and took it seriously.
Brogress,1y3bjy,TheIslander829,1 point,Sun Feb 16 23:39:37 2014 UTC,Ate around 3k calories a day for the 4 1/2 months then went to around 2k a day to cut down on some body fat for the last month and a half. Wasn't too intense on counting macros just tried to get at least 150 grams of protein a day. Ate pretty clean overall.
Brogress,1y3bjy,NewLineCinema,4,Mon Feb 17 00:29:06 2014 UTC,"OH GOD NO. The supplements almost made me not want to start the program. It seemed like a scam just to get more buyers. You don't need sleeping pills, fat burners and two types of bcaas to get fit. I get he is trying to make a profit but preying on newbies who don't know enough to contest what he is saying is kinda fucked up. Is what it is though. However, I do like their fish oils a lot to be honest.  Specifically what supplements I used were Carnivor Mass for surplus, Carnivor for deficit, Optimen multivitamin and Musclepharm fish oils."

Brogress,1y1abf,xpqpqx,70,Sun Feb 16 03:55:34 2014 UTC,"I find it extremely hard to believe you put on 35 pounds of pure muscle naturally within 6 months without gaining any fat, in fact losing most of the fat you had. Furthermore you did this while ""messing around"" for 2 months of the 6? On top of this you've only been lifting for 6 months and your lift numbers are those of a pretty experienced lifter. Something seems off about your story whether its the amount of time this took or the method by which you did it, etc."

Brogress,1y1abf,deckoturf,-8,Mon Feb 17 09:49:53 2014 UTC,"The first pic is unflexed with washed out lighting and a padded stomach, and the second is flexed with much harsher downlighting. That's my fault, if I had another pic to do the comparison with I would use that. So I didn't actually lose bodyfat, I definitely did not gain 35 pounds of just muscle.   As for my lifts, I don't think they're that impressive, Strength Standard doesn't even put them in the advanced categorie (except for my deadlift). Even on this subreddit I've seen plenty of guys that weigh far less than me benching more than me. The reason I have such a long chest/triceps day (which I am thinking about splitting up because it is taking way too long), is because I was doing bench wrong for so long, and mostly hitting my shoulders with it. I've only been deadlifting for about a month, and I hit 405 the first time I seriously tried, and it felt like I could do more but I didn't want to push it and injure myself. I can see you rolling your eyes now. I don't know, I have been going seriously for the last 2 months, the last time I had more than a day off was at Thanksgiving. I live at home and work part time and go to school part time, when I move out I know that there's probably no way I can keep up this routine.   I just don't get it, I was actually conservative with my weight numbers, the last time I weighed myself it was closer to 225, but I just assumed that it was weighing heavier than the scale at the last place I was at, so I went with 220."

There's nothing I would lose by admitting to using steroids, other than ""online pride"" of which I obviously have none of since everyone has their minds made up already. If I was on steroids, I would love to help give advice on taking them safely. But I don't know enough about them to give advice, or take them. I go to a small college gym where I am generally the biggest guy (not the strongest) in the weightroom until a football player walks in. I don't know where I would start to get them. I even asked my friend who has a line on pretty much any street drug you'd want if he knew where to get any kind of roids and he said the first person he'd ask would be me."
Brogress,1y1abf,dillonistired,1 point,Sun Feb 16 18:33:46 2014 UTC,"First off, even if you were flexed in your first picture it wouldn't make much of a difference as you hardly have any muscle there. There is no type of lighting that would make that much of a difference between pictures. You say you definitely did not gain JUST muscle in this period, if so, please tell me where the ""other"" stuff is.  You second picture has very little fat in it. As for strength standards, I don't know a single person that has been able to go up to 405 on a deadlift in only six months. Starting strength, stronglifts, none of these programs will get you there in that amount of time. To say you started off with such a strong deadlift either means you have the genetics of a Spartan warrior/Bear/God hybrid or you're telling us a lie. People who bulk on 3500-5000 calories a week gain around 1-1.5 pounds per week and a lot of this is either water weight or fat.  http://scoobysworkshop.com/expectations/  If you look at his chart, at your age the upper limit for muscle gain is 20 pounds and that's even quite a stretch. Just admit to the cycle and we'll respect it. I have no issue with posting pictures like this but once you try to convince people that this kind of transformation and performance is possible in 6 month naturally, it's a problem."

Brogress,1y1abf,c0sm0nautt,2,Sun Feb 16 10:29:16 2014 UTC,"I agree he should be honest, but a beginner should never base his results on random people on the internet, if you're going to get involved in lifting it's something you do for decades. Just lift hard and eat well for 4 years and see where your body goes.  Variations in people, food availability, training methods/equipment, environment are just gigantic differentiation.  You should never be so gullible to think just because someone else did something you can to, and if you're so troubled by other progress when you've only been lifting for a month or two you just need to stop this fucking hobby.

Brogress,1xxn3i,sparta436,3,Fri Feb 14 23:47:11 2014 UTC,Looks to me like the difference has to do with the angle and lighting in both pics.

If you mean the 135 to 145, I've been eating at a deficit since March but I went from a 750 calorie deficit to a 500 calorie one around October. I also started taking creatine in November. My weight loss plateaued (which I'm fine with) and since I started taking creatine I've been retaining water, which is why my weight went up I think.   Great job on your weight loss, by the way. You look phenomenal!"
Brogress,1xj4yb,JB52,1 point,Tue Feb 11 02:16:29 2014 UTC,You went up 10 lbs eating 1840 calories a day for 2 months? That cannot be right... 10 lbs of water weight? Or are you saying that you went from 750kcal deficit to 500kcal of surplus?
Brogress,1xj4yb,jonesg,1 point,Tue Feb 11 03:11:47 2014 UTC,"I went from a 750kcal deficit to a 500kcal deficit because I was approaching where I wanted to get with my cut. That led to me maintaining around 135 lbs. When I started taking creatine I gained about 5 lbs the first week, weighing in around 140. After my workout yesterday, I weighed in at 145. I'm not sure how much of it is water weight/from the creatine and how much is actual muscle gain. I'm not really preoccupied with weight though, I've been seeing more definition and my pants are getting loose again which is what I care about."
Brogress,1xj4yb,Mark_467,2,Tue Feb 11 03:29:04 2014 UTC,"This is what I don't get - maintaining on 500kcal deficit. What do you consider your maintenance calories to be at?  Sorry for the line of questioning, really don't mean anything negative by it! It's just, you know, similar stats, so I'm curious. The math worked out really accurate for me so I'm just seeing how it is with other people."
Brogress,1xj4yb,Mark_467,1 point,Tue Feb 11 03:36:19 2014 UTC,"Don't be sorry! I calculate maintenance at about 2200kcal a day since I'm extremely active and I'm constantly on the go. I was cutting at 1200kcal (1000kcal deficit) from March to October, so when I upped my calories I think my body started hanging on to all the energy it could."
Brogress,1xj4yb,dyluser,2,Tue Feb 11 03:49:09 2014 UTC,"WOW, you look awesome. Your pictures are sexy as much as they are inspiring. Could you describe how you went from 175 to 135? Did you start working out on day 1 or did you lose at a calorie deficit? How did you get passed eating junk food and refined sugars?"
Brogress,1xj4yb,wooryu,1 point,Tue Feb 11 04:03:28 2014 UTC,"Thanks! I started out eating 1200kcal a day and doing random cardio - I did Insanity daily, I went for runs, I ran a few 5ks. In August, my friend finally convinced me to join his gym. I started going 5-6 days a week, doing probably half an hour of cardio and lifting after.  By mid-October I started focusing on weights and doing cardio sporadically. I also upped my calories to 1800 because I was getting dizzy spells.  My stomach was the only thing still holding fat, so I started eating cleaner. I found it easiest to phase things out slowly. One week I stopped buying cereal, the next I stopped buying granola bars. I started buying healthier things in the same way - one week I'd buy a ton of celery, the next I'd buy celery and spinach. It gradually changed the staples of my diet without being too overwhelming all at once.  I definitely still slip with junk food occasionally, but I try to make better choices when I can. If I feel myself craving something sweet, I keep a few protein bars stocked up - the ones I like are high carb so they don't fit with my diet, but they're nutrient- and protein-dense so I feel better eating those than a chocolate bar. I log any mess-ups in my daily calories and make sure I'm at least within my calorie goal for the day."

Brogress,1xe53z,zdunx,8,Sun Feb 9 07:45:31 2014 UTC,"Sure, I like posting it. Anyone is welcome to critique it as well.   Heavy Pull Deadlifts - 1x5, 3m rest (warm-up with 135x8, 185x5, 225x3, 275x1 all double overhand, working set is with mixed grip) Pendlay Rows - 3x5, 3m rest (form isn't perfect on this, but idgaf as long as I feel it in my lats) Weighted Pull-ups - 2x6-8, 2m rest (definitely the slowest exercise in terms of weight progression) Barbell Shrugs - 3x6-8, 3m rest (with straps) Barbell Curls - 3x6-8, 2m rest (use the straight bar because it activates biceps better, form doesn't have to be 100% perfect) Pec Deck Reverse Flies - 3x10-12, 1m rest (I realize this is for hypertrophy, it fits best in the week here) Smith Machine Calf Raises - alternate each time I do them 3x6-8 and 5x12 Heavy Push Barbell Bench - 3x3-5, 3m rest DB Incline Bench - 2x6-8, 2m rest DB Seated OHP - 3x6-8, 3m rest (wait about 5m after DB Incline to do these, or the weight you can use will be less) Weighted Dips - 3x6-8, 3m rest (emphasis on triceps) Cable Pushdowns - 3x10-12, 1m rest (hypertrophy exercise because I'm trying to bring up my triceps, I use the EZ-bar attachment, dropset last set until you hit 20 reps) Weighted Knee Raises - 3x10-12, 1m rest (contract abs throughout entire set) Arms/Lateral Delts Barbell CGBP - 3x8-10, 2m rest (moderately heavy, studies have shown triceps react well to heavy weight) Cable Pushdowns - 3x10-12, 1.5m rest (I use EZ-bar attachment to mimic Skullcrushers) Rope Pulldowns - 3x10-12, 1m rest (flare at the end, dropset last set until you hit 20 reps) Barbell Curls - 3x8-10, 2m rest (slow negatives) DB Preacher Curls - 2x8-10, 1.5m rest (great for building peak) DB Hammer Curls - 2x10-12, 1m rest (I do 2 regular hammer curls, then 2 cross-body hammer curls, then repeat) DB Lateral Raises - 3x10-12, 1.5m rest (do these however, seated, standing, doesn't matter, I've begun relaxing on form to use heavier weight to see if it induces growth) Machine Lateral Raises - 2x10-12, 1m rest Smith Machine Calf Raises - 3x6-8 or 5x12 depending on what I did last Legs Barbell Squat - 1-3x3-5, 3m rest (my hip flexors have been bothering me lately, so sometimes I only do one set of these) Hack Squats - 3x10-12, 2m rest (literally all you need to build huge ass quads, if done correctly with heavy weight, slow reps, and enough intensity, you will want to call it quits after these alone) Leg Extensions - 2x10-12, 1.5m rest Seated One Leg Curl - 2x10-12, 1m rest Lying Leg Curls - 3x8-10, 1.5m rest Weighted Knee Raises - 3x10-12, 1m rest Back/Chest Barbell T-Bar Rows - 3x8-10, 2m rest (back angle will determine which area of your back you hit; closer to 90 = lower lats, closer to 180 = upper back) Cable Rows - 3x10-12, 1.5m rest (I feel like this is literally the best exercise for overall lat development/back width) Lat Pulldowns - 3x10-12, 1m rest (ironically, I feel like these hit upper back more than lats, superset last set until you feel satisfied with your pump, lol) DB Incline Bench - 3x8-10, 2m rest (the king of hypertrophy chest exercises, hands down) Machine Incline Press - 3x10-12, 1.5m rest DB Incline Flies - 2x10-12, 1m rest (don't go too low, I fucked up my elbow doing that) DB Shrugs - 3x12-15, 0 rest (I do all these sets like a superset, each successive set is 20 lbs less than the last one) Smith Machine Calf Raises - 3x6-8 or 5x12 depending on what I did last   If you have any questions, feel free to ask me!"

Brogress,1x1qlu,stanleythemanley44,7,Wed Feb 5 09:53:50 2014 UTC,"Post a formcheck.  Do you arch your back, tuck your elbows in, and have your bar path go down to where your chest ends?  Usually a persons Bench will be substantially higher than their OHP."
Brogress,1x1qlu,allaboutandroids,4,Wed Feb 5 10:23:26 2014 UTC,"Do what the other guy said, regarding form. Also, when you bench, make sure you come down all the way to the bottom, touch the bar to your chest, pause for one second, then push it up as fast as you can. This will train your neural efficiency much faster and will allow you to put on that second plate a lot faster than doing ""bodybuilding reps"".

Brogress,1x0ga4,BJinandtonic,16,Tue Feb 4 23:32:05 2014 UTC,"I'm 5'7"" and I feel you man. I really don't like it when people say ""genetics don't matter! everyone can put on muscle the same!"" I agree with that... to an extent. Orientals are just generally a smaller and physically weaker people. Have you ever seen a jacked Asian guy who doesn't work out? Now, have you ever met a jacked black guy who doesn't work out? I point out this racial difference with no offence intended. My point is that I truly do believe that Chinese/Asians in general are at a disadvantage when it comes to the iron game. The good thing is that through hard work and consistency (which is a trait the Chinese are known to have), you can fight through the disadvantage and make it. Good luck."

Try to get creatine and protein powder ASAP. You'll see a huge increase in strength and muscle mass if you keep sticking to it. Keep up the hard work."
Brogress,1x1hlv,southernprep1122,1 point,Sun Feb 9 22:13:48 2014 UTC,"I was a distance runner for my high school (2 years) and as most distance runners we have trouble putting on the pounds lol. After graduation last year in June I started to get into lifting at my local YMCA, I spent all my birthday money to get that membership. I started out by eating everything and anything I could find. 3 months into it i started to look at my diet more closely and chose to clean bulk. When I am employed again I will start to buy protein powder, gainer shakes, and creatine.  My workout at the beginning (1-4 months) was SL, here were my stats: Bench Press- 110 5x5 Squat- 185 5x5 Deadlift- 235 1x5 OHP- 65 5x5 BB Row- 100 5x5  The second routine (5-8 months) is push pull Squat Bench Press OHP Leg Extension DB Fly DB Raise SkullCrushers Calf Raises Dips  BB Row Deadlift Pull-ups Cable Row Leg Curl Lat Pulldown DB Shrug DB Curls Weighted Crunch Russian Twist  Everything is 3 sets and the way I add reps and weight is kinda weird so if someone asks Ill gladly answer as to how I usually do it. I go to the gym 4 times a week so ABxAbxx. I don't count my calories exactly but it is around 3000-3500 Kcal a day, sometimes more. I get my protein mostly from meat since i do not have protein powder. Thanks :)"

Brogress,1ww3qs,thelostbathysphere,14,Mon Feb 3 14:31:50 2014 UTC,"Some more info on training/diet (sorry, should have posted that earlier)  Training:Started doing crossfit (don't judge me!) and noticed I was making some gains fast. I kept doing WOD's for about 12 months, until I realized I was hitting a plateau and needed to do more strength work. In hindsight, I should have started that way earlier.  Moved from doing crossfit 5 days a week, to 3 and did 3 strength days, where I worked mostly on squats, deadlifts, cleans & presses. On those days I would also do accessory-work & gymnastics (pull-ups, ring dips, etc.)   Some stats: DL 220 - Back Squat 133 - Strict press 88. Not big numbers, but getting there.  Nutrition: Follow a diet based on the paleo principles, so lots of meats, eggs (about 40 a week), fish, veggies, some fruit & nuts. Added in a protein shake post-workout on most days. My problem was, that I never really tracked macros, so I was probably always just eating enough or less. If I kept a better eye on that, I would have gained a lot more I believe. I also bike to work every day, which is a total of 20K, so am burning a lot of energy.  Supps: Fish oil, Cissus, Vit C/D, did a short cycle of creatine in the last quarter of the year as well. Women can notice a lot of benefit from creatine. Tried ZMA last month and it's great.  Feel a bit stupid in all, because I'm a nutritionist, helping others, but neglecting my own diet in the process. This year, I aim to add more  mucle, perhaps getting to 145 by the end of the year.  Thanks for the positive feedback thus far, it was a big step posting this for everyone to see :-)  Edit: added supps."
Brogress,1ww3qs,GuitarGod1333,2,Mon Feb 3 14:43:44 2014 UTC,"Wow. That's awesome. Thank you! Great progress! I'm wondering... How did you usually eat the egg? 40 a week is a lot! Any good tips to down those things? I'm getting tired of hard boiled, scrambled, etc."

Brogress,1ww3qs,taxonrestroomvisits,1 point,Tue Feb 4 12:08:48 2014 UTC,"Question though, since you are a nutritionist, is there a particular reason for doing paleo? I can only imagine that it's a quite satiating diet but then again it is quite expensive."
Brogress,1ww3qs,ajw431,1 point,Tue Feb 4 12:25:21 2014 UTC,"My main reason was allergies and just feeling like crap all the time, low bloodsugar, etc. I found the basis of paleo really interesting and gave it a shot. Since then, I never felt better.  Not too sure on the expensive part, but if you really want to be strict and buy all organic & grass-fed, it could be expensive.  But I don't think you MUST eat organic all the time to be paleo :-)"
Brogress,1ww3qs,ThunderThighsThor,2,Tue Feb 4 13:46:11 2014 UTC,Thanks for the reply! I'm not going paleo anytime soon but maybe one day I might if I ever feel like crap or just wanna try something new.

I was a bit of a nerd (typical reddit lol) so I joined up 4chans fit board and eventually moved onto the misc, and the not so serious community there kept me entertained and informed at the same time.   In short I was addicted to that lifestyle, I loved it, I loved training and my lifts improved steadily.  My routine has changed a lot and I started with a modified starting strength/ strong lifts program ( I threw in bicep curls, ab exercises etc) and eventually moved into a standard 5 day split before finally taking up layne norton's PHAT routine.   As for supps, only protein powder and BCAAs as well as creatine occasionally.

Brogress,1wr8ab,Zephyr4813,2,Sun Feb 2 20:12:19 2014 UTC,Yeah my bench is garbage :(  Try not to think of bulking in absolute term. I don't think its a good idea to set a certain goal weight. I believe in using progress in the mirror and at the gym to track how far I'm along rather than just looking at the scale. I used to think like that and ended up fat after my first bulk.

Brogress,1wrrw1,Wanderlust917,1 point,Wed Feb 5 04:10:20 2014 UTC,"In terms of bringing up your arms, I would advise that you hit them twice a week, not in a full workout 2 times a week, but once on an arm day and once on a day where they're a secondary muscle group but you also do a couple arm isolation exercises to exhaustion.  But everyone is different in how they respond to arms.  A lot of people say that higher volume sets but only a few exercises work well on arms.  You don't need to do tons of different exercises to get big arms, just do a few with higher rep ranges - it's time under tension that matters, not weight."
Brogress,1wrrw1,penotti,1 point,Wed Feb 5 04:12:50 2014 UTC,Alright. I wasn't sure if doing lower weights with higher reps would build them better than doing low reps with high weight. I seem to be going up pretty slowly in overall strength on the arms and wasn't sure if continuing with lower weight/high rep would ever advance me in strength or only size.

That way, I ensure that I get very sore :) And, I started eating a lot. I used to eat like 2000 cals/day and now I eat 3000-3500 (I take a mass gainer shake)"

My workouts vary a lot so I couldn't tell give exactly what I do.  Chest - I like dumbbells a lot more than barbell but I do both. I also mix in some hammer strength movements and the obligatory flies. I have a shitty chest though  Back - Lot of pulldowns, cantilever rows, cable rows, hammer strength rows, pullups, etc.  Shoulders - Dumbbell military press all day. Shoulders are stupidly strong in proportion to everything else. Last week I pressed 120s 8 times. I'm a fan of supersets with shoulders.  Legs - I opt for higher weight to exhaust myself quickly. ATG squats, deads, weighted lunges.  Dietwise I basically just eat a pile of meat (chicken or beef) and a cup(ish) of brown rice or pasta every 2-3 hours. If i had to guess I'm probably consuming somewhere between 3-4k calories a day with at least 250g of protein minimum. I'm bulking right now so I don't really care that much where my other calories come from"

Or sometimes I'll just have an arm day on a Sunday but I seem to have pretty big arms without really having to work them. It makes buying shirts a bitch because shirts that fit me well in the chest and shoulders will often be too small in the sleeves. Not sure if I'm bragging or complaining haha

Brogress,1whhv2,beersconsin,5,Wed Jan 29 19:42:11 2014 UTC,I'll get back to you in a couple hours. I posted this on my lunch break and works a little crazy right now.   The biggest thing is I try to do a 1 second positive and 4 second negative for 6-8 reps and 6-9 sets. I try to hit between 21 and 24 sets total on about 3-4 different lifts.  Calories [2400ish] Protein [230grams] Carb [160] Fat [81g] I shoot for what it says on IIFYM but i dont always hit it.  Unfortunately I haven't done my 1RM on anything in a while. I've been meaning to but it always feels like a waste of energy I could be putting towards the rest of my lifts.
Brogress,1whhv2,TheLionest,1 point,Wed Jan 29 20:08:59 2014 UTC,"Can I ask how you cut down the weight before u started lifting and could u get into more detail about what you did while lifting? I had a similar body type to you when you started. I'm 5""11 though."
Brogress,1whhv2,TheLionest,3,Thu Jan 30 01:27:11 2014 UTC,"Pre Lifting:  When I first started I was an absolute idiot about it. I probably lost a lot of muscle i could have kept. The whole thing kicked off by me agreeing to run a 5k with some friends. This lead to me getting a gym membership because Florida summers are brutal. I would run about 2-5 miles 4 days of the week usually run Monday/Tuesday, Rest Wednesday and then run Thursday and Friday. My calories were just stupid during this because I did absolutely no research on the best way to cut and lowered my calories to 1600. To maintain I needed something in the 3145 range. 0/10 would not recommend. I slowly moved into doing a few of the machines at the gym but i would just hit the same 5 things everyday 1 lift each of chest/bi/tri/back/shoulder after running. I guess the biggest thing that had helped me was calories. I'd never tracked them before. The Myfitnesspal app is your best friend.  While lifting:  I adjusted my calories to be more in line with what they should be. It was still a deficit (between 800-500 below TDEE) but luckily you can go decently far with noob gains and supplements.  Once I started getting serious about it my friend who is huge into weightlifting joined me. I took a lot of cues from him. 3-4 Lifts a day aiming for between 24 and 27 or so sets. We would do 6 reps with a 1 second positive and 4 second negative for a total of 30 seconds and then have 30 seconds rest between each lift.  I feel like we do pretty standard lifts.  Each day is dedicated to a certain Muscle/Muscle group. We do some kind of combination of  Chest: Dumbbell Press, Incline, Decline, Cable Flys, Chest press Machine, etc  Bicep: Curls, Side Curls, Hammer Curls, Preacher Curls, and a burn out set of 10/8/6 just moving down the curl bars  Tricep: Tricep Extension, Kick Backs, Tri pushdowns, Skull Crushers  Shoulders: Seated Press, Standing Press, Shrugs, Shoulder machine, Side raises, Reverse Flys  Back: Lateral Pull downs, Row machine, Bent over rows, Pull ups, Hyper extension Dead lifts  Legs: Squats, Cleans, Dead Lifts, Running(sometimes) Calf Raises  For our Ab work out we mix it up but we always do at least a combined 500 ab reps.  I feel like more than anything the 4 second negatives have helped a lot. You have to swallow your pride and lift lower weight to get the lifts but you really miss a large part of the workout if you just throw weight up and let it drop with minimal resistance. Besides that I'm not sure man. I've made it my hobby and try to bust my ass every time I'm in the gym. It's a complete lifestyle change.  Hope something in my rambling helps.  TL;DR There's no TL;DR in fitness."
Brogress,1whhv2,TheLionest,1 point,Thu Jan 30 02:15:24 2014 UTC,"Thanks a lot, mind if I message you with any questions? I really think you made a great transformation. I am 17 so I am still young but would love to have a body like yours compared to how much bigger I used to be. I am just confused if I should be lifting weights and how much my calorie intake should be. I have just been running and eating healthier. Starting to kinda plateau."
Brogress,1whhv2,simphon-e,2,Thu Jan 30 02:32:50 2014 UTC,"Absolutely man feel free. I'm not really an expert but I can always tell you what I did and what works for me. Just research everything and try to take in as much info as you can (R/fitness, Bodybuilding.com etc)  With my body type I realized I'm either going to be fit or fat. There really isn't a lot of room in between. Definitely lift if you are trying to keep muscle/build/tone muscle. Even if you suck at it at first you'll get better. Everyone starts somewhere. Although though I started out doing nothing but running I try not to do it a ton because I don't want to burn a whole bunch of muscle. I'd honestly say if you are tracking you calories and adjusting as you lose weight, you are eating a lot of protein and you are working out to tone and retain muscle you'll be fine."
Brogress,1whhv2,simphon-e,1 point,Thu Jan 30 02:41:00 2014 UTC,"Would you recommend I stop running and start lifting? And just reduce my calorie intake but consume how much protein? I still have a bit of a gut and oblique fat, not to mention some fat around my thighs, but I am at 175 pounds compared to when I was 220 pounds."
Brogress,1whhv2,Molinkintov,3,Thu Jan 30 02:44:33 2014 UTC,"Definitely start lifting. Personally I would maybe run every other day high intensity/short duration. I usually run around 2 miles and try to aim for under 15 minutes. Some of it is genetics. My body decides it wants to store fat in my gut first and lose it there last (hence my bottom abs not wanting to show). Cut to a body fat % you can maintain until you are ready to bulk (my goal is 8%) then bulk/cut/bulk/cut/bulk/cut until you are happy with it. Like I said you remember to update your TDEE for increased work frequency, weight loss, being put on a torture rack and gaining 3 inchs? pretty much anything. As far as protein it's supposed to be 1g per lb of lean body mass. I usually aim for higher than 1g per lb I weight just to cover my bases."

Brogress,1w9aa8,ATurtleSight,-2,Mon Jan 27 21:04:18 2014 UTC,I don't know why you've been downvoted. Drugs are generally lipophilic to get absorbed through the GI tract and they do distribute into fat. If you then burn off that fat you will release drugs back into the bloodstream. An example is the pesticide DDT that is highly fat soluble and can stay in adipose tissue for years.

Brogress,1w6s2z,Illblood,2,Mon Jan 27 06:03:18 2014 UTC,"Thanks for all the great comments, everyone! I'll tell you guys exactly what I did.   First of all, this is my fifth year lifting, but I was doing everything wrong before, and I would go to the gym sporadically and didn't really diet well. I've been using the THT program at Musclehack.com for four years now, but I've never bulked, and I've only been very dedicated to doing the program as written since August of last year. I always would go on Mondays, and Mondays was always Shoulders and Traps day, so that's why that part of my body is so much larger than the rest lol.   The THT program is free, and here is the PDF if you don't want to sign up for the email list.   For the past 3.5 months I've done TSPA, which is the cutting program on the Musclehack site. You do have to pay for it, but the bulking program (which I linked above) is free. I will give you a brief overview of TSPA so you still know exactly what I did, but I highly recommend you pay for the book (it's $47).  For my diet, I ate low carb (about 60g carbs per day), about 168g protein (2.75g per kg of lean body mass), and the rest of the Calories I filled up with fat. I started with about 2000 Cal per day (TDEE is 2600 Cal), and I gradually cut down on the fat, while keeping protein at 168g and 60g carbs, and now I have 1700 - 1800 Cal per day. Low carb was Saturday - Thursday, and every Friday is Carb Up, where I refill my glycogen stores with 375g carbs, 97g protein, and 28g fat. I usually cheated on my carb up days, though, and haven't followed those days as well as I should.  A couple weeks in I started implementing ""Fat Flush"" days, where I pretty much only drink protein powder all day, to maintain my muscle mass while my body gets the rest of this energy from fat. I can only do this 2x per week, though, on non consecutive days, so I'd usually do low carb Sunday through Wednesday, Fat Flush Thursday, Carb Up/cheating day Friday, and another Fat Flush on Saturday. I have not done any cardio yet, but since my fat loss has not been as fast as before, I'm going to start doing two 20 min sessions of HIIT per week.  I was dropping at least 1.5 lbs per week, and if one week I went under, I would add a fat flush, cut calories a bit with fat, and now I'm implementing cardio. The past month I have hovered around the same weight, but I've been gaining muscle and I keep dropping body fat.  My food logs are all here.  So there's the diet!  Now for the workout, I did a 5-day split. If you have Android, you can simply download the Musclehack app for free and the workouts are all there. The TSPA 5 day is pretty much the same as the THT five day on the app, but it has a few less sets since it's meant for cutting. After I did the 5 day split for 10 weeks, I took a week off and now I'm doing the 3-day split exactly as it's written in the app and in the THT book.   I do 8 - 12 reps to failure for almost all the exercises.  Here is the link to the 5-day split I did for ten weeks. Hopefully it works!  If you're too lazy too look at the THT book and just want to see the 3 day split I've been doing for 4 weeks now, it's this one.  Here are all the logs for THT.  TL;DR: Eventually I ate a low carb Cal deficit four days out of the week, two ""Fat Flush""/all-protein days, and one carb up. Food logs. I did this workout ten weeks, took a week off, and have been doing this for four weeks.  EDIT: Forgot to add, only supplement I use is creatine and whey protein (not sure if that one counts)."

Brogress,1w33fs,leangainsaws,5,Sat Jan 25 09:56:14 2014 UTC,"Don't be scared to start implementing deadlift to your program. I have scoliosis to my back which gave really bad lower back pain when deadlifting. It took couple of months of corrective form checking and strengthening lower back.   The best thing that helps me with tissue/muscle pain in lower back is laying on hard foamroller with a little movement (literally all the pain goes away).   Once you get the form right, and notice you don't have to ""deal with"" back problems, you will feel great.   On topic nice progress!"
Brogress,1w33fs,Somf_plz,3,Sat Jan 25 11:30:13 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the tips! I fucked up my back recently doing deadlifts (it was my ego; I hadn't worked out in a few weeks when the injury occurred, and I felt some pain, but worked through it thinking it was because I was just getting back at it. I was wrong.) and have been unable to continue my current routine because of it. I was/am actually contemplating seeing a chiropractor, but maybe I'll try the foam roller route first."
Brogress,1w33fs,ilovemagicmush,1 point,Sat Jan 25 07:15:46 2014 UTC,My issues are with flexibility and range of motion.  I can't even get down to the bar without my back bending.  I have to do deads in the squat rack just so I can attempt to do half to three quarters of a rep correctly.
Brogress,1w33fs,ilovemagicmush,3,Sat Jan 25 08:54:57 2014 UTC,"Looking Good! If you don't mind me asking I'm curious about 1) What your stack looked like and 2) how much running the cycle cost? 3) As a younger guy, would you do it again?"
Brogress,1w33fs,nacnudn,6,Tue Mar 4 12:54:30 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the compliments, I ran Testosterone Enanthate at 600mg/wk split into two injections on Monday morning and Thursday evening. I kickstarted the Cycle with Dbol at 50mgs a day for exactly 30 days. I kept arimidex on hand throughout and started using it at .25mg EOD when I started seeing some estrogen related acne. My PCT starts in 1 week and its going to be Nolvadex at 50mgs for the first two weeks and 25mgs for the second two weeks. I have to say I responded VERY well to Testosterone and experienced almost no side effects besides slight backne and slight oily skin. I would recommend any young person who is interested in gear to do a TON of research beforehand and plan everything out methodically and be prepared for the worst even though it's unlikely. I had an AMAZING experience with my first cycle and I'm already planning my second cycle. On another note, If you're young and considering gear but you're not fully satisfied with your height I would not recommend hopping on because of the fact that there is a probability that the increased estrogen could negatively effect your growth due to fusing of any unfused growth plates. Most importantly, if you're young and have to ask others if YOURE ready for gear, the answer is most likely no. You'll know when you're ready because you won't have to ask others.  EDIT: The cycle cost me ~$300. This includes 3 vials of Testosterone Enanthate 300mg/ml, 60 tabs of 25mg Dbol, Liquid Arimidex, Nolvadex, and 100 syringes with 20g pins for drawing and 25g pins for injecting."

Brogress,1w33fs,iiTzGambit,16,Sat Jan 25 03:12:52 2014 UTC,"If your bench has actually only gone up 10 pounds over 4 months, then I hate to break it to you mate but you're not on steroids."
Brogress,1w33fs,Cthulu2013,8,Sat Jan 25 03:14:05 2014 UTC,A 10lbs increase on bench in 3 months can easily be achieved naturally. If you're a actually on gear if suggest either eating more or seriously reconsidering the quality of your source... taking quality gear alone without even lifting would increase your bench more than that...
Brogress,1w33fs,imnumber4,-12,Sat Jan 25 04:14:05 2014 UTC,no its quality gear. i've actually been sick 3 times.. like flu/fever. killed my gains.  its fucking gay as hell.  i still need to eat more like actually though

Find a Calculator online that shows your maintenance level and then add 300 to 500 calories a day to get a bulk going.  It may take a few weeks to see if you are putting on any weight and if you need to adjust your intake.    Oh and don't forget to lift!"
Brogress,1vv02y,GhostriderFlyBy,1 point,Wed Jan 22 18:02:37 2014 UTC,"This is pretty helpful. Any guidance on fat macros? Is all fat the same, as far as bulking goes, or should I pay specific attention to saturated/monounsaturated/polyunsaturated ratio? Thanks!"
Brogress,1vv02y,DoodlePip,2,Thu Jan 23 16:59:31 2014 UTC,"Most of my fat comes from PB, olive oil for cooking, fish oil pills, eggs, and Chicken (or whatever meat you like to eat).  I have never gotten into breaking it down which types of fats."
Brogress,1vv02y,GhostriderFlyBy,3,Thu Jan 23 17:03:42 2014 UTC,"There's not really such thing as ""clean bulking"" or ""dirty bulking"". Sure, there are some studies out that show that not all calories are created equal, but for the average person it comes down to food composition: fats, proteins, and carbs. I got fat as hell this past offseason eating lean red meat, brown rice, and spinach. Sound dirty? No. But it can still make you fat. Point being, diet is a lifestyle. I wouldn't want you to kill yourself worrying about whether the food you're eating is ""clean"" enough. As a beginner, it matters less. If you want to put on size, track your protein intake and ensure you get enough calories. If you find the lifestyle is for you long term, and you can stick with it, the rest of the knowledge will fall into place with research."
Brogress,1vv02y,thelostbathysphere,2,Thu Jan 23 15:44:52 2014 UTC,Some great info here. It backs up what I've been reading about Bulking recently too. Thanks.
Brogress,1vv02y,najra3000,2,Thu Jan 23 19:41:54 2014 UTC,"You're confusing ""clean and dirty"" foods with ""clean and dirty"" bulks. When referring to foods, it relates to how healthy or micronutrient dense the foods you consume are.  Clean and dirty bulking however, mean consuming a small (300-500kcal) or large (500+kcal) caloric surplus over your maintenance calories.   Like you said, you can have a dirty bulk eating clean foods and vice versa."
Brogress,1vv02y,najra3000,1 point,Sat Jan 25 09:14:11 2014 UTC,"Well, that's true."
Brogress,1vv02y,Somf_plz,2,Sat Jan 25 13:40:02 2014 UTC,"Vary your diet, have a proper routine and proper macros. Varying your diet makes it fun as I find that having a low surplus for a lean bulk to be very monotonous.  Proper routine is key as having a lower surplus means that you cannot eff around as much in the gym as you would having a larger surplus due to recovery. Do compounds. Lastly keep the fats to around 0.5g and protein of 0.8-1g/ weight in pounds. The rest should be carbs.   Bonus tip: Rest well. This is the time you're actually building muscle."

Brogress,1vrc2e,_V_I_P_,2,Tue Jan 21 23:50:43 2014 UTC,Amazing transformation ! Seriously inspiring since I have a very similar height and weight. Could you please post the workout and a sample diet ??
Brogress,1vrc2e,mid_or_afk,2,Wed Jan 22 00:35:18 2014 UTC,How many workouts did you miss over those 2.5 years? What programs did you try?
Brogress,1vrc2e,xVerda,2,Wed Jan 22 01:18:11 2014 UTC,"I went to Europe for 3 weeks in February 2012. I hit the gym only 3 times while over there.  But between March 2012 and December 2013 , I'd probably say I've missed about 3-7 workouts maximum. I go 4x per week."

Brogress,1vivz7,penotti,2,Sun Jan 19 01:31:46 2014 UTC,Would be awesome if you could share that with everybody here! Good job on your transformation!
Brogress,1vivz7,penotti,3,Sun Jan 19 02:29:37 2014 UTC,"This is the message I sent to someone else about my diet (*for gaining). I'm more than happy to discuss and share further.  Hey man. I figured I'd shoot an outline of my diet for you as a few people were asking. I'm kind of doing this from memory and its been a while so a few things may be off but its fairly accurate and a good starting point. I've learned what works for one person really won't for another. So use this as a baseline. This was also for someone was was 180 pounds. You can probably eat less than this and still gain based on your current size, but as your weight increases you should increase your food intake accordingly. Hope this helps. Breakfast 7:00am 6 eggs, 4 whites. 1 Cup oatmeal 2 tbsp peanut butter 10-10:30 4 Rice cakes 2 tbsp peanut butter Protein Shake (Gold standard whey 2 scoops) 1-1:30 Side salad with 2 tbsp olive oil and some sort of vinegar (Apple cider V will help cut down on some of the creatine bloat you may experience...and its delicious) 8oz lean protein (Chicken, white fish, turkey are great. I keep my red meats to 3ish servings throughout the whole week) 1 cup of carbs (Small sweet potato, quinoa, brown rice etc) 1 serving of dark green veggies 4pm 8oz lean protein serving of carb serving of veggies 1-2 oz mixed nuts Gym around 5:30ish IMMEDIATELY after gym 2 scoops whey protein with 1 cup of coconut milk, (fill rest of shaker with plain water) 8PM 8oz lean protein serving of carb serving of veggies Right before bed 1 Cup of plain cottage cheese"

Brogress,1vivz7,leradarling,1 point,Mon Jan 27 08:50:41 2014 UTC,"Yes I am. Dandelion root tea also works well (I dont mix the creatine with the vinegar, I have them at separate times during the day). I of course can't find the articles I've read about it, just a few forum posts. ACV is also known to have a bunch of other great health benefits, so I just have a side salad with that and olive oil every day with my lunch."
Brogress,1vivz7,Kbanana,2,Tue Jan 28 01:36:26 2014 UTC,Thanks for that! The fact that creatine bloats me up is the reason I'm actually sometimes reluctant to use creatine. Will give this a try!
Brogress,1vivz7,TheBrownFlavor,2,Tue Jan 28 07:23:33 2014 UTC,When I'm really trying to prevent it I'll do the salad with like 4ish TBSPs (I really like this stuff) and I'll have a DRT at some point in my afternoon.

Brogress,1vigy1,Halibaba,2,Sat Jan 18 13:42:21 2014 UTC,"No problem man! Glad to help if I can in anyway... Its weird giving advice, as all I have done is take advice from others, so bare with me lol.  First off, you already have more equipment than I do, so you should be pretty set, as long as your dumbbells are decently heavy enough for your own weight/strength.  My routine isn't all that crazy. 3 days a week, Monday Wednesday, Friday... Full Body. I recently have started running a mile on Tuesdays and Thursdays just to start some cardio. Here goes:  Each set, I do something like a superset, but for different body parts... For example: I do one set of push ups and then one set of Goblet squats, repeat x3  Superset 1:  1) push ups - using push up bars or flat on the ground, whatever you can do... I prefer bars because its harder at a negative degree when you go all the way down. Do until failure (I usually do around 35 per set) x3 sets  2) Goblet Squats: I use a 45lb dumbbell, but you can use more if you have more... Really make sure your form is good for optimal gains, otherwise you'll be wasting your time. Do until failure (Mine is around 25-40 depending on how I feel) x3 sets  Superset 2:  1) Bend over Rows (I do kind of a hybrid reverse bend over fly combined with a row..) Idk what it is, but it has worked for me and have gained A LOT on traps and lats muscles doing so)... 15-25 per set x3 sets  2) Shrugs - one 45lb dumbbell (or whatever you have) in each hand. 15-30 reps per set x3 sets. Adjust your rep amount depending on how much weight you have and what you feel you can handle.  superset 3:  1) Bicycle Sit-ups - Knee to opposite elbow type. 35 reps x3  2) Dumb-bell Fly's/Press - on a flat surface, do fly's or presses (depending on what gives you the most burn since you're most likely using light weight) I sometimes do 1 set press, one set fly, or vice versa 25-35 reps x3  Superset 4:  1) Ground level dips - Done using push up bars behind me and getting my ass as high off the ground as possible... Looks reaaaallly retarded doing these, but it has worked wonders for tris. 25-45 reps x3  2) Skull crushers using curl bar and weights from barbell... I use about 55lbs of weight, and as a superset, it works really well and you feel the burn... 10-15 reps x3  Superset 5  1) ""Triple Curl Bicep Killer"" - 55+lbs on curl bar   15 curls outside grip 15 curls normal grip 15 curls inner grip   All above need to be completed without rest in between rep sets Do all 3 of these rep sets x3  2) Calf Raises, 45lb dumb bell in one had, balance with the other. 25-35 reps x3  END  Like I said, each of those sets in the supersets are done sequentially... So after one set is done in a superset, rest like 30-45 seconds, and then onto the other muscle group in the superset... rest 30-45 seconds, and back to the first muscle group as a 2nd set.   Hope this helps a bit... First time trying to describe my workout, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask. I don't take my workout as the best out there, but it has worked for me so far. Other things may yield faster/better results for other people. The best part about lifting is being able to experiment and have fun with it. So enjoy! :)"

I ate about 3000 cal/day.

I try to have complex carbs for breakfast (my biggest meal of the day and where the majority of my carb intake comes from) and any other carbs I take in throughout the day come from some sort of vegetable. As much as I love rice and potatoes, I stay away from them entirely and everything else is some form of protein (chicken, steak, fish, etc). I try to eat something roughly every 3 hours because I'm always starving by then but it can be something as simple as a protein shake."

Brogress,1vby27,Fruit-Jelly,1 point,Fri Jan 17 02:15:03 2014 UTC,Look at the dates... it was 1 year.  Pretty drastic.  I suspect gear.
Brogress,1vby27,gookies5,8,Thu Jan 16 10:48:38 2014 UTC,"Dropped from 315lb in Dec 2012 to a low of 223lb in late June. I normalized at around 228-230lb after eating at maintenance the first two weeks of July. I put on about 14lbs in 14 weeks after that before deciding to do a physique show. I'm currently around 238 and trying to hit 220 before peak week (hit the stage around 215lb, maybe lower.)  Remember I was a division one offensive lineman. Lots of muscle mass and strength/weight room experience. It's not like I was 185 and put on 60lb of mass in 14 months.   Here's a pick from the end of July. You can check my post history for more I'm sure. I was crazy flat and depleted after 6-7 months straight of cutting. Not quite indicative of gear use.   http://i.imgur.com/AmKsXbZ.jpg"
Brogress,1vby27,duffmanhb,-1,Thu Jan 16 19:08:50 2014 UTC,"Even with gear, a pound a week on an already heavy frame is impressive."

Brogress,1vby27,keeshond5,2,Thu Jan 16 20:53:45 2014 UTC,"Haha the first two were before pictures for bb.com contests. The July = speed light + night time + professional portrait photographer. Definitely ideal conditions. I do regret not getting more photos from the beginning of my transformation though, especially since I am a video professional.   I'll post some final progress pics when I get closer to my show date too."
Brogress,1vby27,anddd514,3,Thu Jan 16 13:18:21 2014 UTC,Same thing for me. It's funny how the progress pictures always end up being done better at the same rate as we are beginning to look better. It makes for a good contrast though.
Brogress,1vby27,anddd514,8,Thu Jan 16 13:37:43 2014 UTC,"Diet:  Originally I just ate 6 meals a day with fist sized portions of a lean meat, complex carb, and green veggie. Once that stalled, I started tracking my calories and hitting close to a 40/40/20 macro split (April - July 1).   I started a bulk the second week of July and went straight through October putting on about 1lb mass per week (topped out at 242).   At that point some friends who were body builders convinced me to start training for a physique show in April. I basically ate at maintenance from November - mid December before starting my diet about 14 weeks out from an April 5 show.   Supplement wise I took your usual whey protein, whatever pre-workout was on sale and whatever thermogenic was on sale. More or less to keep up energy at work while maintaining my calorie deficit Feb-July.   Routine:  I originally started Chris Gethins 12 week trainer before suffering a hernia at the end of February and having surgery March 17. I made a quick recovery and was back training upper body and cardio fully after 4 weeks (still lost 12lbs during recovery). I finished the Gethin trainer in July and started basically Shortcut to Size through most of the bulk. I finally started regaining much of the strength I lost during my cut, and gained confidence back in my squat (serious mental barrier post hernia).  Currently I'm running a PHAT program:  Day 1- Power Upper Day 2- Power Lower Day 3- Rest (cardio + abs) Day 4- Hypertrophy Back and Shoulder Day 5- Hypertrophy Chest + Arms Day 6- Hypertrophy Lower Body Day 7- Rest (cardio + abs)  I'm prepping for a show, so my diet is a solid 500 cal deficit plus cardio, with 1g protein/lb body weight, between 100-200g carb with high carb days falling on leg days. Fats usually fall between 50-100g pending carb intake.   A little background. I'm a former Division 1 offensive lineman (4 year starter etc) so I'm relatively experienced in the weight room. However, this is of course a completely different style of training than I did from age 14-23. Its been a hell of learning experience. And probably the best decision of my life.   Hope that answers some questions."
Brogress,1vby27,ur2l8,2,Thu Jan 16 15:48:39 2014 UTC,Can you detail the diet? I am currently bulking and trying to stay away from counting calories. I'd like to start doing 5-6 smaller meals a day with portions of carbs and meats. Any advice?
Brogress,1vby27,NewLineCinema,2,Thu Jan 16 04:37:27 2014 UTC,"What's your height, weight, lifting  experience, and estimated body fat %?   My younger brother is 6'3 and 186 and has put on 20lbs in the last four months. He's always been a stick and to put on weight he had to start seriously counting his calories so he could figure out an effective surplus was. Once you get an idea of what the nutritional value of your preferred protein, carb and fat sources are calorie counting becomes less important than proportions.   Edit: my brother has informed me he is ""no less than 6'3."""
Brogress,1vby27,anddd514,1 point,Thu Jan 16 12:19:19 2014 UTC,"5'11"". 23 years old. 153. Been lifting on and off for years. Lately making no progress. Under 10%"
Brogress,1vby27,NewLineCinema,2,Thu Jan 16 12:31:20 2014 UTC,"If you're under 10% and holding 153 a nice bulk is definitely in order. One of my close training partners is about 190 right now and in the 5'10-5'11 range and cuts down to 170-176 when on stage.   A bulk for you would be a minimum of like 2,700-2,900 calories per day at 153g protein (600 cals), up to 300g carbs (1200 cals) and your fats will likely just fill the rest in depending on your protein sources.   Its tough to eat big, but oats, peanut butter (2 tbsp = 190 cals), and whatever meat/eggs you can get your hands on will definitely be enough. I suggest downloading my fitness pal or the Lose It! Apps if you have a smartphone. Use that for a couple weeks and you'll have a better understanding of what proportions equal nutrient wise.   I know calorie and macro counting sucks, but its honestly one of the best tools you have especially when in a rut."
Brogress,1vby27,adrocknola,1 point,Thu Jan 16 12:38:11 2014 UTC,Just read through the thread. Good tips. Thanks.
Brogress,1vby27,SweetPeaMigee,1 point,Thu Jan 16 13:33:39 2014 UTC,Your body fat is way too low.  Eat more.  Carb up. Cut later.

Brogress,1velob,texas1105,20,Fri Jan 17 00:31:08 2014 UTC,"Philosophical answer: Get more confidence so you don't feel the need to show off your muscles 24/7. The fact that you say it needs to be obvious that you work out sounds a lot like you might have self-image problems.  Practical answer: Wear slim fit clothes. Italian suits, slim fit dress shirts, tight fit t-shirts, etc. Get stuff tailored if necessary."
Brogress,1velob,Dejimon,-2,Fri Jan 17 09:50:27 2014 UTC,"If I can respond philosophically as well, isn't that kind of a glass half full/half empty kind of thing?  I dont feel bad and want to show off- I feel good and dont want to hide my work unnecessarily.  Subtlety is key in professional environments and I figured someone would have some tips."
Brogress,1velob,Dejimon,7,Fri Jan 17 14:24:05 2014 UTC,"Speaking as someone that lifts and wears dress shirts and suits to work, I don't feel as if I'm hiding anything. I'm just dressing as is expected and the fact that the young hot interns can't see my bulging muscles doesn't really bother me.  It was just a thought anyway, if you're not trying to compensate for something, all the better."
Brogress,1velob,IntellegentIdiot,-2,Fri Jan 17 15:13:17 2014 UTC,"I feel and appreciate where you're coming from, but it's a little disheartening when the only opportunity for the ""hot young interns"" to see that you're cut is when they're already in bed with you or on the rare occasions you are at the beach if you don't live in Cali or Miami. That being said, if under a jacket, you wear a fitted button-down dress shirt, v-neck, or henley, it should be enough to make you look good, but not like you're trying to show off. After seeing these responses, that's good enough for me.  I guess that's just how things are. It's the same with girls, in a way. If you show too much cleavage, you look like a try-hard, so you wear a tight-ish sweater if you want to display your assets subtly."
Brogress,1velob,DeathByTeaCup,2,Fri Jan 17 16:01:28 2014 UTC,I think that's the point. You might be putting too much emphasis on trying to impress those interns. What's to say they'd be impressed anyway?
Brogress,1velob,DeltaTauReddit,-1,Sat Jan 18 22:04:29 2014 UTC,"Maybe that example has been extended too far. If I got a nice haircut, it would partially be because I liked it and because I think other people will, yes? Does it imply that I have low self-confidence if I say, ""I work somewhere that requires me to wear hats. Do any of you who also wear hats often have any suggestions for things to wear on my head so that my new hairdo that I like so much isn't completely covered?"""

Brogress,1velob,Criminalia,3,Fri Jan 17 01:11:02 2014 UTC,"Maybe someone doesn't need to be able to see that you're ripped when you're wearing a suit. As far as I'm concerned, they don't."
Brogress,1velob,philldaagony,-1,Fri Jan 17 03:15:03 2014 UTC,"That makes sense, but if thats generally how I dress, how will the hunnys know I even lift?   I think v-necks are probably thd most subtle way I can think of, but maybe some of you guys have other ideas."

Honestly that was the very beginning of when I started and I didn't even squat or deadlift for almost a year after that so ballpark estimates I'd say 85 bench in 2010, maybe around 135 squat and 185 deadlift in 2011. If you meant my actual weight I was 136 in 2011 and I'm 182 now.. Not too sure about the weights during the process, though. Pretty much steady progress from when I started incorporating my diet mid-2012 up till where I'm at now."

Brogress,1v7m4n,Rerichael,9,Tue Jan 14 20:51:08 2014 UTC,"I mean I've always found that even doing a standard deadlift (not straight-leg) really kills my hamstrings and glutes, so that combined with the squatting on Day 1 and the lunges on Day 5, I'm hitting my legs almost every workout. Which is intentional because it's a weak area of mine."

Brogress,1v7m4n,Kbanana,1 point,Wed Jan 15 04:59:49 2014 UTC,"Well you don't really get ""big"" just from doing 5x5 training. 5x5 is great for building strength because you're doing less reps so you can push heavier weight.

For a bulk you want about 500 above maintenance otherwise you just put on fat that takes harder dieting later on.  Not to be an ass but program looks like crap to me, try and pick up a PPL (push, pull, legs) routine if you are only going to be going to the gym three times per week, you will get a lot more out of it. Make sure you start doing those deadlifts.  Lastly, clean your damn room!!"

It just ends up being more fat that you have to try and burn off later, doing a clean bulk you can actually see progress as time goes on and don't have to pretty much kill yourself to get lean again when it comes cutting time.  Plus I find that the more weight you put on the shittier you feel, I mean who wants to be in the gym with a gut, even during bulking season. For me I just felt like crap all the time with that much extra fat that really wasn't helping me at all anyways.  So why go through that all that extra work just so you can eat like a pig."

But aimed to hit 70f/500c/160p @3300 calories  Here's a video proving my lifts over 3 months ago:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNTZ3NVona0"
Brogress,1uw6fc,SaltedMilk,2,Fri Jan 10 17:35:26 2014 UTC,"Just some critiques (awesome progress btw):  For your squat it looks like your high bar positioning is causing you to fall forward and lose tightness in your upper back. This can be improved pretty easily in just a few ways. You can look up info on how to low bar squat.  Or you could purchase a pair of weightlifting shoes with a heel (I bought the rogue do-wins,  not a crazy thick heel which I like)  and strengthen your upper back (chest supported rows,  face pulls,  Chin ups for crazy volume) and maintain your high bar positioning while focusing on an upright torso. I chose this option and it has helped me continue to increase my squat and work past my sticking points. It looks like I had the same weak point as you. If you want to see some vids of my form I'm on Instagram as power_lifting and there are some clips of me squatting pretty recently.   For your bench I'd recommend looking up Dave Tate's elitefts bench videos on YouTube. You need to focus on getting tight and setting the weight while using leg drive. Those few quick fixes will make you a lot more stable and you'll be crushing more weight quicker than you'd think.   Awesome progress! Ever think of competing in powerlifting?"
Brogress,1uw6fc,JustWhy,2,Sat Jan 11 00:16:38 2014 UTC,"I have an honest question, but what is going on with your squat? Are you focusing on getting honest ATG depth and that is slowing you down? Did you get some sort of injury at some point? It seems like based on your Dead and Bench that your Squat would be somewhere in the the 350-375 range, especially with the routines you did.   Not to say that your lifts and progress aren't impressive, especially for a year, just that it seems like your squat stalled somewhere or has a less intense progression"
Brogress,1uw6fc,ilovemagicmush,-4,Fri Jan 10 19:04:12 2014 UTC,"Why did you prematurely jump from SS to an advanced program like 5/3/1? Everyone is different, but my numbers are higher (except deadlift) with less than a year experience and being on SS for only a few months.   Good job none the less!"

Brogress,1uw6fc,ilovemagicmush,9,Sat Jan 11 00:23:11 2014 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/mISDlhb.jpg this is a screenshot of a video of me squatting 440 for an easy single last week. If you need more proof of how much I lift you can find me on instagram: power_lifting there are plenty of videos of me lifting. This kid didn't get super shredded and looks pretty young. When you're that age 40lbs of mass (this was not 100% muscle)  is totally achievable. Honestly 40lbs of muscle in a year when you're going from skinny teen to a man is not unbelievable at all. Maybe if he got shredded,  while doing this and was big and vascular with huge capped shoulders and striations. Then maybe I'd say juicing. I'm not naive and a lot of people juice but this kid obviously isn't. And if you think he isn't, maybe you should reevaluate your progress and realize you aren't working hard enough/doing the right things."

SS.. GSLP.. GVT.. PHAT). figured i just had low test or something  then i got on the juice.  woohoo actual gains!  i dont believe people can make gains like this without SOME juice... maybe just prohormones or whatever. 50 lb of muscle in a year is like 1lb a week. that's a fuckton of muscle"
Brogress,1uw6fc,malice16,2,Sat Jan 11 00:48:00 2014 UTC,"And it's totally do able when you're young and a teenager. Maybe you did have low test? Did you ever get blood work? But honestly it's most likely a lack of eating enough,  recovering enough or training hard enough.  That's the fix the majority of the time. Getting on gear obviously brings you to the next level and is something I'd consider down the line but it isn't an investment I can make atm and I'm still pretty young."

No gains.. 4500 calories.. gained just fat  I trained like fuckin mad bro, every last set to failure, I was screaming and my face was red. It was brutal. I was very motivated.  Well my deadlift went up pretty consistently but that's it. My upper body shit didn't go up at all.  never had blood work though... i figured i may just have low test. i guess i'll never know at this point but i don't really care anymore haha"
Brogress,1uw6fc,nilspils,1 point,Sat Jan 11 00:59:01 2014 UTC,"Try get blood work at some point. Your insurance could cover trt! And a lot of training is not going to failure! Training too much can be as bad as training too little. I hardly ever go to failure and in the past year my deadlift has gone from struggling with 495 to hitting 550 (feeling more than that next time I test in a few weeks)  bench has gone from 225 to 280 (last time I competed but since then I've had some huge rep prs,  315 should be hit soon)  and my squat from 395 to 455 (last time I tested was months ago based on the 440 I'm feeling somewhere around 470).

I'd start off lower weight higher reps so that you can get to the point where you won't be as sore. Regardless if your able to do it anyways."
Brogress,1uyz3v,BakedTrex,1 point,Sat Jan 11 18:10:01 2014 UTC,"I was thinking that, like for someone who's never really squatted before whats a good starting point? What I did was I went in, went to the power rack and put two plates on the bar, did a set of 5 and it felt pretty good. I kept adding 5 or 10 pounds till I got to 175 and I felt really challenged with that weight. I know lifting more than you're really capable of can be really detrimental to making gains. I've also read that lifting with DOMS is actually a good thing. But honestly with the soreness I feel in my hamstrings I can barely get up on my squats."
Brogress,1uyz3v,BakedTrex,1 point,Sat Jan 11 18:14:20 2014 UTC,"Basically its irrelevant how easy it may feel if you get that sore afterwords. Being really sore is basically telling you its too much. Now don't me wrong, being sore is a good thing, but when it interferes with your lifting then it isn't. As for a starting weight, it really depends, put a weight that you're able to do 8-10 reps of for about 3 sets. See how sore you get and adjust as necessary. After a week or two of that then adjust to higher weight lower reps so you wont be as sore. It just sounds like you're jumping into too heavy too fast. Just remember, if you're getting too sore to even continue, then its too much. Don't be afraid to start with a easy weight just to build yourself up."

Create a healthy habit of going to the gym, and you'll learn to love it.  The progress comes with time.  Until then, enjoy yourself, and be proud of the small steps you take towards your larger goals.  Those are what really matter."

Brogress,1uql4o,weckliz,2,Thu Jan 9 16:57:32 2014 UTC,"Just to give a bit of a pep talk:  I'm 25 now.  I started ""lifting"" when I was in 9th grade, so 14?  I say ""lifting"" because I had no program, no direction, and was really just following my curl bro friends.  When I started I couldn't get the bar up for a single rep, so I started benching with the 25lb curl bar.  Long story short I lifted on and off in high school and by the time I got to college I could squeak out 135 x 10, and I think my 1RM was an ugly, ugly 175 or so.  Last year I decided to get serious about lifting again, and started on SS, with the following numbers:   Bench: 135 Squat: 125 Dead: 145   For my working weights, so 3x5.  I had periods of 2-3 months where I'd be good about getting to the gym, but moving, a pulled hamstring, and some fuck around itis got me to the beginning of this year, where my numbers were:   Bench: 205 Squat: 270 Dead: 305   And I've since switched to Texas Method, so I've slowed down a bit.    When I was in high school, I was a rail.  I graduated at around 6' and 130lbs.  When I graduated college, I was about 160lbs or so.  These days I weigh in at around 210-215, because I'm always bulking bro, but I certainly don't look fat.  Trust me, START NOW, and by the time you're 25 you'll make my current numbers and physique look like I've never touched the iron."

Since you don't have a rack to properly squat in, I'd say just practice body weight squats, just to start getting to depth and stretching everything out, it should make actually squatting that much easier.  Does your school offer intramural weightlifting?  That's how I got into back in the day.  Ask around, usually we'd just talk to the football coach and see when he could open the weightroom for us after school, or during football/basketball/baseball lifting practice."

Chest/tricep day: Bench press, incline bench or incline dumbell press, flies (both standard and incline), dips, cable rope pulldowns, skull crushers etc. Leg/shoulder day: squats, hack squat, leg extensions, leg curls (occasionally), calf raises, shoulder press with dumbbells, machine shoulder press, arm raises, forward arm raises, and shrugs for traps.   I work in abs whenever I feel like it. Usually around once or twice a week.  I just keep repeating 1,2,3,1,2,3, and I give myself rest days often. I just listen to my body and see how I'm feeling as far as recovery goes.  I tend to go anywhere from 3-6 days a week.  My rep range is normally 6-10, but if I'm feeling strong, I will go heavy and do less reps than that.  Hopefully this answers your question."

Brogress,1uo7c7,ProfessorDrewseph,6,Wed Jan 8 04:38:26 2014 UTC,"Keep up the great work man. What kept your interest in lifting weights? What did you keep as your constant motivation? The longest I've been exercising in one period was 3-4 weeks (that's running, crunches, push-ups. I didn't have a gym membership) before I got bored with it and stopped."
Brogress,1uo7c7,Gtchy1230,22,Wed Jan 8 02:24:13 2014 UTC,"There were pretty much five things that kept me focused on lifting.   Zyzz. Although cliche when it comes to lifting this picture was my first inspiration to just keep going. I saw a little bit of myself on the left and thought that if that kid (Aziz) could do it, then I could too. My ultimate goal, be it three or even ten years from now, is still to get to where Zyzz was at when he died. Around March 2013 I bet a friend of mine (who was 6'0 125lbs) who just started crossfit that I would gain more weight than him doing my own thing. We agreed to weigh in come July 2013. Once I made that bet it really pushed me because I wanted to beat my friend just for the bragging rights. It was a good bit of fun on the side and gave me someone to compete against on my fitness journey. You guys. Anyone that posts on /r/brogress, /r/fitness, or /r/progresspics . This was something I would see on a daily basis while browsing reddit and ya'll really gave me the extra push I needed sometimes. Current body threads on 4chan's /fit/ are also awesome. Myself. Believe me, I am the last person to stick with things that I start on my own. When I started lifting, I was motivated by disgust/embarassment when I looked in the mirror. I had found a real desire to change. I hated lifting for the first three months, there was nothing I enjoyed about it and it bored me to death. I was lazy but I soon found the out the joys of lifting three months after I had started. I looked at the pictures I had from February and saw what a difference I had made for myself. This is what got me hooked: the satisfaction derived from tangible results. Short Term Goals: I started out with one goal: I wanted my arm to fill the sleeve of my school uniform. Check. Now I want to be able to bench the bar with a 25lb plate on each side. Check. I set small, easily achievable goals to provide a sense of constant progression. This is easily the most important motivator anyone should have imho. Progression is the name of the game.   My Advice to you: you can only improve from the point you're at now. Log your progress. Build your motivation/support system. Start now and don't give up."

Brogress,1uo7c7,mrvega,5,Wed Jan 8 15:00:13 2014 UTC,"I think that before I ever consider gear, I have to see what my full genetic potential looks like. In three years or so, I'll look at myself and ask myself if I'm satisfied with what I see. If I'm not, maybe I'll consider cycling. Thats a big maybe though."
Brogress,1uo7c7,realjefftaylor,6,Wed Jan 8 15:46:37 2014 UTC,Why would you even ask that question? At 6' 155 he still has a loooooong way to go until he's even close to his genetic max. Gear shouldn't even be a thought right now.

Brogress,1uo7c7,TruKiller,1 point,Wed Jan 8 18:45:03 2014 UTC,"It's looked down upon if you use it as a crutch. It shouldn't be used as a shortcut. But if you reach your full genetic potential (or at least close to it) after years of lifting, I totally respect guys trying to take it to the next level, physically.   It can be very dangerous for newbies because their CNS and joints won't be able to catch up with their muscles, and can cause serious injuries. It's also very dangerous for young people because their hormones are already raging and it can seriously mess up your system long term.   It's not that you have to get on gear to be considered ""serious"". But you shouldn't even think about it until years into your training. I'm 22, been lifting for years, but only got serious about it in the last 12 or so months. I don't think I'd like to ever take gear, but I haven't ruled it out. I know I still have a lot to do on my own, and gear is a serious commitment; it is a lifestyle."

Some of it is obviously fat and water I gained back after season. Currently not cutting for this year.--- We all know the only way to gain that much muscle is to follow Mike Chang's ancient Chinese secrets, which is too powerful for me."
Brogress,1u76rp,Afeni02,12,Thu Jan 2 17:05:04 2014 UTC,Routine? Lifts?
Brogress,1u76rp,JCSwneu,8,Thu Jan 2 04:28:21 2014 UTC,"What I did the past year: Day1: Chest, tris Day2: Back, bis Day3: Shoulders, traps Day4: Legs Repeat  I've since added an arm day in between Day 3 & 4.  Don't know my PR's right now since I dont like to max during season, so this is as close to what i can tell you.  Bench: 205x8 Squat: 250x8 Deadlift: Haven't in a while due to pulled muscle during wrestling (not because of shitty form).  *edit: also squat is ATG."
Brogress,1u76rp,JCSwneu,31,Thu Jan 2 04:38:22 2014 UTC,I cannot believe people think you've taken sterons...is everyone here a fat neckbeard? Do you guys not know what kind of gains you can make with a year of solid training. His body is perfectly achieveable natty. This subreddit man...
Brogress,1u76rp,finalcut19,19,Thu Jan 2 03:44:52 2014 UTC,Plus puberty growth spurts.
Brogress,1u76rp,MonkeyBotherer,4,Thu Jan 2 07:58:19 2014 UTC,I was gonna say dem growth spirts!  Start of my sophomore year I was 5 ft 1 110lbs had two gym classes per day and got 7 inches taller finished the year 5 ft 8 180!
Brogress,1u76rp,crazymusicman,1 point,Thu Jan 2 16:11:37 2014 UTC,That's impressive.
Brogress,1u76rp,TheAbomidableKumquat,2,Fri Jan 3 02:51:39 2014 UTC,"Well isn't the maximum amount of muscle someone can gain in a month about 2 pounds, which means that in a full year the maximum would be 24 pounds? I'm sure that muscle is growth is easier to achieve during puberty, but I think twice as much as the normal maximum range is pretty overboard. I think for that reason, coupled with the fact that steroids and the wrestling community have gone hand-in-hand for decades, makes it a fair question to ask."
Brogress,1u76rp,CircuitryOfDoom,6,Thu Jan 2 10:53:16 2014 UTC,"a fair question to ask.   Exactly. There is a difference between accusation and a question. 50lbs in a year is a lot, although not inconceivable considering age, and perhaps staying at 145lbs for making weight for wrestling before bulking? OP should clarify."
Brogress,1u76rp,Sciar,6,Thu Jan 2 12:47:10 2014 UTC,Cut down to 145 from 165 and currently not cutting at 195. Gained the 165 back after season immediately. Gained a bit of fat getting to 95. If I would've cut I would've either gone 170 or 182
Brogress,1u76rp,StavTheSwole,3,Thu Jan 2 13:48:52 2014 UTC,Cut down to 145 from 165 ... Gained the 165 back after season immediately   this makes much more sense than lb muscle/week.
Brogress,1u76rp,HomelessInBangkok,2,Thu Jan 2 16:10:15 2014 UTC,"Come on dude, dont act like 50lbs of muscle, natty, while wrestling, in 1 year is normal. Is it possible, unlikely but sure its possible, but to act like this is a normal change is just just setting people up for disappointment."
Brogress,1u76rp,Schmedes,26,Thu Jan 2 11:39:05 2014 UTC,Would it kill you guys to at least say congrats on the transformation before asking if he's natural?    Nice job OP.
Brogress,1u76rp,HomelessInBangkok,5,Thu Jan 2 02:44:42 2014 UTC,"I figured out what worked for me so yeah started the right way. The pictures in January I cut down from 165 so when season ended I gained that back immediately. I did gain fat obviously (going from 165 to 195), so having said that I think it's totally possible naturally."
Brogress,1u76rp,Schmedes,2,Thu Jan 2 07:43:34 2014 UTC,1lb a week isn't unreal. Especially not if you have just started working out seriously.

How much of a toll does it take on your body? And also, I imagine you probably have to eat a lot more than say an ""average"" body builder, considering all the calories you prob burn out during training, how much do usually eat to make sure you achieve them gains? I ask because I'm considering taking up BJJ again and don't know if I might be biting off more than I can chew."

Brogress,1u76rp,dssssd,2,Thu Jan 2 06:34:08 2014 UTC,"They don't really do anything usually besides neck bridges for a little bit as stretching, but what I've noticed is it's just from wrestling for years and doing shrug motions for setups and such.

Brogress,1u2mk9,kieranhw,8,Tue Dec 31 05:21:07 2013 UTC,Your dead should be the biggest lift.  It's a little strange that your squat and dead are the same.  Now that I think of it - your squat is fairly high for your weight.  Good progress.  You might consider doing a 5x5 program.
Brogress,1u2mk9,NewLineCinema,4,Tue Dec 31 07:10:19 2013 UTC,"Thanks! I've been careful to take Deadlifting slow while building lower back strength, and I've been struggling with grip strength a bit lately (hence the addition of Farmer Walks on Shoulder day), I'll look seriously at a 5x5 program for the New Year"
Brogress,1u2mk9,NewLineCinema,2,Tue Dec 31 07:40:07 2013 UTC,"I started deadlifting and a 5x5 program in late October.  I had problems with grip strength so I switched to mixed grip and invested in straps, wraps, and chalk.  I'm currently doing 320 on the deadlifts and 265 on squats.  I only dead for one set of 5 reps every other workout.  Mixed grip might help you a great deal until your grip increases."
Brogress,1u2mk9,kyraniums,3,Tue Dec 31 07:49:14 2013 UTC,"A little side note: if you want to compete, it's best not to train with straps and wraps. And also to use mixed grip as a last resort.   Mixed grip also doesn't increase grip as much as normal grip, and since you progress in weight, you shouldn't expect to suddenly have proper normal grip after working with mixed grip."
Brogress,1u2mk9,tehgreatblade,2,Tue Dec 31 13:19:43 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I started deadlifting at lower weight without straps a few months ago and not only has my grip gotten stronger, but I can see major growth in my forearms. I'd recommend it to anyone."
Brogress,1u2mk9,DontNeedNoThneed,2,Tue Dec 31 21:48:46 2013 UTC,"/r/griptraining if you need it,   great work op"
Brogress,1u2mk9,asljkdfhg,3,Tue Dec 31 10:05:22 2013 UTC,"Not really. Deadlift and Squat progress similarly at lower weights. I think it's when you hit the higher numbers, squat progresses less than deadlift.  I might be wrong, though."
Brogress,1u2mk9,watchthenlearn,1 point,Tue Dec 31 09:27:58 2013 UTC,I feel like this is not far off... My dead and squats are similar but I've noticed that my deadlift is increasing now at a faster rate.

Brogress,1ttj8t,YoutubeKnifing,8,Fri Dec 27 18:17:27 2013 UTC,"So here's my basic info.  First 4 months I followed keto, as my initial weight loss(203-147) was done using keto/low carb, I just bumped up my protein. After that I jumped on IIFYM for my first cut at 2,250 calories per day, 200 grams protein, 200 carb, 65 fat. For bulking i tried to go 3,000 calories a day, just hitting my proteins and trying to keep fats low, but admittedly the past week was far over that.(Damn holidays)   For my current cut I'm running 2,150 calories per day, 190 carb, 200 protein, and 65 fat.  I haven't followed a specific workout the whole time, but the 3 I have used were 6 day splits(Came from different workout partners) and I'm starting PHAT on monday.  I also don't know my 1rm's because I have never maxed out on any exercises, I just follow whatever program I'm doing."

Brogress,1tjolk,AASresearch,12,Mon Dec 23 19:30:40 2013 UTC,Going to they gym and actually pushing myself has never been a struggle for me. The struggle has always been staying on track with my diet. Mainly because I hate to cook and meal prep but if you can nail that part down the rest is cake. It never gets easier though you just grow to love it when you see the gainzzzzz.
Brogress,1tjolk,howdoireachthese,1 point,Mon Dec 23 19:47:05 2013 UTC,that is great advice about caring about my diet as well as my routine.  I am like you that I am not over weight weight and already have good frame work to start on.  I need to keep the motivation to make it happen.  On the days you did not want to go what is something you told yourself?
Brogress,1tjolk,caliboy_19,6,Mon Dec 23 20:20:40 2013 UTC,"Oh yea there are plenty of days that I don't want to go. I have found a few tricks that I like to use to help keep me motivated. The main thing is make sure you are eating right and eating enough throughout the day, that way you will actually have energy and it will be less of a physical problem then a mental motivation problem. Secondly I remember that feeling of leaving the gym thinking im one step closer. Tell yourself that it is only 1hr you can do it. If I still can't get motivated, I just put on a youtube video of some aesthetic sick cunts putting in work (no homo)."
Brogress,1tjolk,caliboy_19,1 point,Mon Dec 23 20:30:37 2013 UTC,"Those are the best days, because they train your mental swole as well as physical."

Brogress,1tjolk,smarge24,44,Tue Dec 24 01:55:08 2013 UTC,"Both take as much work as you are willing to put into it. I cannot speak for anyone else but I know what I have put into it. I  don't think I am any better than anyone because of what I choose to do to my body and I realize If I quit taking gear today I would eventually go right back to being at my natural limit. Sometimes I feel like I am offending others by choosing the enhanced route mainly because of the remarks I overhear in the gym. My intention was to never offend anyone, I simply know that the body that I want is simply not achievable naturally.  I have much respect for people who choose to take the natural route mainly because being natural is the most frustrating feeling because eventually you hit a brick wall and there is nothing you can do about it. I just didn't want to come in hear screaming ""natty"" or ""lifetime natty"", I hate when people do that shit because it gives others such a false hope of what is achievable. Not talking about your usage is one thing but to claim natty and yell it from the roof top is a whole different story, especially when you are pushing some bullshit supplement. Those types of people are scum and are no different than any other scam artist. IMO they should be exposed. End of rant..."
Brogress,1tjolk,jmikolash,2,Tue Dec 24 02:31:20 2013 UTC,"I completely agree and I dont judge anyone for using because its always going to be personal preference its your body its up to you what you wanna put into it and the results you wamt and how fast you want them. What ticks me off is others who defend gear users saying oh it still takes alot of work oh i respect gear users alot, well being big naturally takes a whole lot of work too. Alot more time and patience especially"
Brogress,1tjolk,usmcplz,3,Tue Dec 24 02:44:55 2013 UTC,"lol I gotcha. Yea I think the main thing is gear users can get away with doing things that naturals cannot while still maintaing their physique. Me personally, I am more dedicated since I have been on aas then I ever was when I was natural. I feel like natural bodybuilding is like trying to win the tour de france on a beach cruiser. But some people love beach cruisers and I am perfectly ok with that, there is nothing wrong with that at all."
Brogress,1tjolk,NerdMachine,0,Tue Dec 24 02:54:56 2013 UTC,"It's not quite like that since most natty bodybuilders aren't looking to compete. Everyone has different goals like getting stronger, getting bigger, getting more aesthetic, and these can all be accomplished natty. Just like most people who do bicycling don't plan to enter the tour de france.  Though if you are planning on competing OP then of course you gotta use gear - just as everyone in the tour de france uses gear."

They are the same type of people who bought in to all of the fear mongering by the media regarding hormones.

Brogress,1ti83r,leddzepp,2,Mon Dec 23 06:10:59 2013 UTC,"Hah thanks but a bit extreme! I am happy with my progress but there is always room for improvement and things to work on in the future ;)  And yes the pants are awful, reserved for wearing around the house i didn't even think about it when i decided to try and grab some pics!"
Brogress,1ti83r,garnett8,3,Mon Dec 23 07:48:23 2013 UTC,"Wow, how'd you survive an entire year after watching the video?"
Brogress,1ti83r,corvade,2,Mon Dec 23 14:32:26 2013 UTC,It has taken me many years to recover.

Brogress,1ti83r,Daske,2,Mon Dec 23 18:13:18 2013 UTC,What was your routine? Or routines? Very nice job by the way!
Brogress,1ti83r,Hornpub,1 point,Mon Dec 23 20:12:56 2013 UTC,"Thanks! Routine is a 6 day split, often i'll leave out the rest day and go right through. Not that i believe it's necessary or optimal but i love my time in the gym and lifting weights.  Day 1: Legs & Abs (Hamstrings and glutes dominant; Squat, SLDL, hip thrust, leg curl)  Day 2: Chest & tris ( DB bench, weighted dips)  Day 3: Back and Bis (trap / thickness dominant; all sorts of rows, elbows out. Shrugs, rear delt work here also)  Day 4: REST (or go on to the next day depending on how i feel)  Day 5:Legs & Abs (Quad and calve dominant; front squat, lunges, split squat)  Day 6: Chest, shoulders & Tris (incline press, shoulder press, raises, face pulls)  Day 7: Back & Bis (lat / width dominant; deadlifts, weighted pullups, pull downs, pullovers)  Not limited to the exercises listed, just some examples of ones i usually include on those days. Previously i was working in the higher rep ranges with high volume of sets, now that i'm coming off a cut I'm adding some strength (i.e 5 rep squat / deadlift) but still primarily bodybuilding structure."
Brogress,1tht16,onemessageyo,8,Mon Dec 23 00:43:03 2013 UTC,did you really rip that shirt? impressive gains man...
Brogress,1tht16,Kbanana,6,Mon Dec 23 02:15:50 2013 UTC,yeah i ripped that shirt pushing a uboat at work haha
Brogress,1tht16,zogeta1,5,Mon Dec 23 02:42:53 2013 UTC,Workout and diet pls
Brogress,1tht16,svesrujm,4,Mon Dec 23 06:31:54 2013 UTC,Serious question; you went from not lifting to those numbers on your bench squat and dead in 10 months?  I feel I've been lifting wrong because I'm nowhere near those numbers. What program did you follow?
Brogress,1tht16,Sr_Gajo,3,Mon Dec 23 05:39:00 2013 UTC,"http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1tdsmv/progress_10_months_135180_511_male_many_pictures/  In that thread I went through pretty much everything that I did. To answer your question, yes, I went from not lifting to those numbers. I did work out in high school and still did push ups here and there so I was able to start benching on 135 even without proper depth. Same with squats, I was able to squat 135 kind of poorly, but never had to work with lower numbers on anything but deadlift."
Brogress,1tht16,svesrujm,3,Mon Dec 23 15:54:12 2013 UTC,It's all about the diet.
Brogress,1tht16,SLaY_FLaW,2,Mon Dec 23 18:22:16 2013 UTC,"I've gained 30lbs since I started lifting, 145 to 175lbs, and look good, but am just nowhere near those lift numbers. I feel is got diet pretty down.  I think I'll start adding 5lbs every week and progressively until I get my numbers up."
Brogress,1tht16,agent_carmichael,7,Tue Dec 24 00:50:07 2013 UTC,"Hit pecs more, not looking too juicy in that side pose. Otherwise good progress. Especially considering how skinny you were in that first pic, must have put on a fair bit of weight in those first 4 months."
Brogress,1tht16,anddd514,1 point,Mon Dec 23 02:55:19 2013 UTC,Thanks. I'm aware that my pecs are lacking. I have fucked up shoulders that I'm working on fixing. Pretty much any chest work irritates it.

Brogress,1tht16,stanleythemanley44,1 point,Mon Dec 23 03:22:03 2013 UTC,This is very nice. What was your routine/daily caloric intake?
Brogress,1tht16,stanleythemanley44,1 point,Mon Dec 23 14:24:40 2013 UTC,http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/comments/1tdsmv/progress_10_months_135180_511_male_many_pictures/  Caloric intake was ~4k when I first started. By the middle of the summer I brought it down to 3600.
Brogress,1tht16,AnnoyingMoFo,1 point,Mon Dec 23 15:55:37 2013 UTC,What do you recommend for bulking and staying lean?
Brogress,1tht16,TruKiller,1 point,Thu Jan 16 00:06:09 2014 UTC,"Start off lean. The more fat you have, the more effecient you are at gaining fat. You're also spending calories just to support those fat cells that you could have otherwise used to recover or burn for energy. I think if you start out around 10%, you will stay pretty lean. Also, if you make your diet somewhat repeatable, it's easier to make small adjustments so that you can dial back calories without going overboard."
Brogress,1tht16,SLaY_FLaW,0,Thu Mar 6 18:47:14 2014 UTC,"Not trying to undersell OP's progress, as it's very impressive and he clearly worked very hard.   But I think this goes to show how much easier it is to look good if you start out as a skinny person as opposed to a fatter person. It's rather disheartening, in a way ""/"
Brogress,1tht16,TruKiller,15,Mon Dec 23 05:18:48 2013 UTC,Except for Fat Person Calves. I'm always 'mirin the fat person calves.
Brogress,1tht16,TruKiller,2,Mon Dec 23 05:46:54 2013 UTC,"I don't know what you mean by easy. There was nothing easy about this. I've seen many progress posts from people who were skinny like that and ended up with a lot more fat/worse proportions. Now I might have good genetics for it, but the difference between a fat person and a skinny person is that the fat person should cut first."
Brogress,1tht16,doerings,0,Mon Dec 23 15:57:12 2013 UTC,"Not easy, but easier. When you're used to being fat doing a long cut like that takes a lot out of you. And it's disheartening to work so hard just to end up looking like you were in the first pic.   I know the work and determination required both inside and outside the gym to get where you are, and it's incredibly impressive. But it's just frustrating to see skinny guys get so huge with very little fat gain like this. But really all I'm doing is complaining, I know. And I guess letting others know to get skinny before they bulk."
Brogress,1tht16,Billytown,3,Mon Dec 23 17:24:16 2013 UTC,"I've also been mindful of my eating habits an athletic all my life. Obesity runs in my family and I've made it a point not to ever let myself get fat. Before bulking I would only eat around 1200 cals on a normal day. Anything is easy once you're used to it. I have trouble now controlling my eating. Instead of only eating 3600 its easy for me to eat upwards of 5k. Trust me if I was fat, and I was sick of it my results would have taken longer but I would look the same. Any excuse or obstacle I've come across is just a challenge, and I like a challenge."
Brogress,1tht16,Billytown,1 point,Mon Dec 23 22:12:30 2013 UTC,"You know it's better if you say nothing at all. He has better genetics, he's undergoing puberty, I produce low test, i'm old, he's young, he started of skinny, i'm fatty. Just keep those to yourselfs, they do NO-ONE good."

Brogress,1tdyn7,Newdles,1 point,Sat Dec 21 16:36:21 2013 UTC,"Super delayed, but at a damn trampoline park I'd been to dozens of time. Landed on a trampoline wile someone was on the bottom of their jump. The lack of springiness combined with my momentum, my knee gave way and the howling began."

Brogress,1tdyn7,ttremble,5,Mon Jan 6 00:42:41 2014 UTC,"I wanted to wait till I was mean and lean as possible to post here, but I tore my ACL last month and just had ACL reconstruction surgery, so I haven't been able to keep up my progress. It was a huge blow considering I'm big into running. In the meanwhile I figure I'd post my meager progress up until the injury for motivation. I'll post my workout routine of anyone's interested."

Brogress,1tdyn7,TheDiscoBall,1 point,Sun Dec 22 03:10:33 2013 UTC,"Keep up the good work! Having dedication, a routine and goals to get back to will help with recovery and sticking with physio. :)"
