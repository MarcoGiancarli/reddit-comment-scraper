He was golfing during the interview and had less interest in soccer than my dad. Poor Davo and Rog were scrambling to get him to say anything interesting about soccer and then scrapped that idea and scrambled to get him to just say anything interesting at all.  /rant.

meninblazers,3a8zko,critical_stinker,2,Thu Jun 18 14:18:47 2015 UTC,Agreed - I think a big difference is whether or not they're being interviewed about anything that they have particular expertise in. Dave Fishwick on minibuses and running a bottom-table team? Lots of interesting stuff. Some random celebrity about their lukewarm fandom? Likely crap.
meninblazers,3a8zko,mightystewbacca,3,Thu Jun 18 18:42:34 2015 UTC,"I think with Davo's TV background, he knows that you get better ratings (or downloads) if you have more mainstream stars on your show, even if they don't really know that much about football. I think it's more to try and build their listener base, even though the quality of the show can suffer.  The moments that stick out for me as borderline un-listenable, but totally understandable as to why they booked them are:   Drake: said he was both a Manchester United and City fan and saw nothing wrong with this, he was clearly just there to promote FIFA 14. The lead singer of some indie band who literally played a round of golf during his phone interview. Rog did some research to find out he played high school soccer, but the call was a waste of time. Props to MIB to try and make it a fun segment, but they should of hung up on him for the lack of respect. There was also an NBA player in the past 6 months who said he loved playing with Man City on FIFA because he can use Tevez. The pro athlete interviews are usually horrible unless they are a soccer player or they are a foreign player playing in America. They all contain:    ""Yeah, me and the guys love playing FIFA on our road trips at the hotel. I love playing with Barcelona."" ""I played soccer back in high school. Did I mention I like Barcelona? Messi is like, amazing."" Rog making an Everton reference/joke, followed by complete silence by the athlete."

It was from a story Roger told about a fan whom he was seated near, who after someone scored against Liverpool (I think?) shouted, ""Take that Gloria!"" I think Roger pressed him, as to why he would shout that, and the gentlemen responded that Liverpool (again, I think?) was his ex-wife's favorite team. Basically schadenfreude.  Please fill in the dots for me if anyone remembers better, or can find the clip.  Edit: Found it. I was close but had a few details wrong. It was a friend of Rogers, who recounted the story to him, not Roger himself.  & Rodger=Roger."

I have so much love for Rog's public criticism of FIFA. He describes the situation so eloquently, yet colloquially, in the way we'd all like to do ourselves. I'm also loving the line he keeps using about this being America's greatest gift to Europe since the Marshall Plan."

meninblazers,379auq,vokal_guy,6,Sun May 31 14:54:51 2015 UTC,"Between the British ""series"" meaning what we understand as a ""season"" and their overall exuberance, I think it's just a big misunderstanding. If a show is ending, there's usually an announcement or something, and the (in this case) hosts would probably acknowledge the fans or something.   Basically, if they haven't said they've been canceled, they haven't been. But they may not yet have been renewed. That would also come with an announcement. My guess is that a decision hasn't been made yet.   NBCSN snatched them up from ESPN after the 2014 World Cup, so unless their ratings have been dog shit, they'll probably get another season. They do manage to get a surprisingly broad pedigree of celebrities, so celebrity soccer fans seem to just love the idea of going on. And if you've got that kind of a draw in your show, you keep to on, especially with what are almost certainly low production costs.   Even if they get canceled, they have a podcast with a ton of the same content that I absolutely love listening to. Whatever happens I doubt this is the last we'll hear from Dave-o and Rog."
meninblazers,379auq,manuscelerdei,2,Tue May 26 02:15:30 2015 UTC,It's not like Davo needs the show to survive.  I imagine he does it for fun anyway so even if they were to get cut from NBCSN then they still might do it for fun...

meninblazers,354dvt,Widmerpool70,2,Thu May 7 18:24:28 2015 UTC,I agree. Each person that gives money should be allotted shares. Even if Rog and Davo were onboard 100% and every GFOP donated we probably would still be coming up short by some distance.

meninblazers,2y0xfc,burgundyjoe,2,Thu Mar 5 22:18:09 2015 UTC,"Do you want to be a bandwagon jumper? Probably not.  So pick the only MLS team that has NEVER made the playoffs (and actually played a game so far), TFC.  There is no bandwagon, only you!"
meninblazers,2y0xfc,curlygc,2,Fri Mar 6 04:19:02 2015 UTC,"I'll be following the Crew, at least for now.  I have spent a lot of time thinking about this, and I cannot support a league properly unless I have a team. I live in NC, so there's no team here (I am hoping for one to come to Raleigh, but Charlotte seems more likely someday).  I'm originally from NJ and have historically supported the NY teams that tend to inflict years of intolerable suffering upon their fans (Mets, Jets, Nets) and that probably explains why I was instinctively drawn to Tottenham when I started following EPL back in 2006.  As much as my instinct is to gravitate toward a NY team, I cannot support NYCFC b/c of the link with Man City.  Nor can I support the Red Bulls, because I see them and think Arsenal: red kits and Thierry Henry. So I'm defaulting to Columbus because I lived there and went to school there for 12 years, and I actually remember attending Crew games back when Brian McBride was still playing in MLS.  And the kits are awesome.  Having said all that, just watch all the games you can, eventually a team will pick you."

Normally my first piece of advice is to pick the local team, but... ick.  You should support Columbus. We have Frankie Hejduk in our front office. And in the 90s we were the Buffalo Bills of MLS; really good, but not quite good enough to get past DCU in the playoffs.  http://www.mlssoccer.com/video/2015/02/27/columbus-crew-sc-team-preview-2015-mls-guide  Let's get weird."

As a soccer crazy kid I watched whatever matches I could, including Champions League on ESPN2 in the 90's.  I picked Real Madrid as my club and still follow them to this day.  THAT SAID, my love for Real has been thoroughly surpassed by my love for the Timbers.  You simply cannot compare watching a game on tv to watching one in person.  Getting to occasionally see the players around town randomly or at team events is also plus.  You may not ever put DCU above Chelsea, but there's still something to be said for watching a live soccer match and rooting for the home team."

Hands down. Look no further.  FC Dallas shares Chelsea's philosophy of building their squad from within, not splashing the cash on any current high-priced player of the day. Who needs rich owners willing to spend money on the best players around when you can buy at the thrift store and hope for the best? It's like the two clubs are joined at the karmic hip, they're so identical.  So, there you go. No need to thank me.  DTID  But seriously, as others have said, local is usually best."

meninblazers,2y0xfc,Rainandsnow5,1 point,Fri Mar 6 06:15:16 2015 UTC,"I live in Minnesota and we have a great NASL club (MN United FC) but I still want an MLS team to root for until we get one here. I also chose to follow Tottenham Hotspur several years ago after a friend urged me to pick an EPL team to root for.  It has taken me several years to get accustomed to the fandom of the EPL and Spurs but it is totally worth it and a great experience especially for someone like me who is pretty new to ""soccah"" (shout out to Dave-O) and accustomed to but getting tired of American Football fandom. My advice is to take your time, do some research, and just wait for some of reason to root for a club. It could be a player you like or a style of play or team traditions. Watch games and keep up with stuff like Kick TV and the MLS channel on You Tube. If you don't have a local team, take to Twitter and Reddit and find out what media outlets cover a team you are interested in and follow that. Don't be pressure to pick a team. Rather, be patient and wait for someone or an event to capture you and make it worth digging into a team some more.  I still haven't picked an MLS team and I might not until we get a local club here in Minnesota (which should be soon).  Finally, don't pick a frontrunner. Pick an up-and-coming squad that you can watch develop. I think that is way more interesting."

meninblazers,2vggxf,missmaggiet,8,Tue Feb 10 20:53:16 2015 UTC,"I was one of the people who was credited with helping out that piece. in case you care, here are my thoughts on the whole thing from like two years ago (they made some better changes in the AFC sides).  Aston villa is Titans-generally a team that is decent but never great. A good player (Johnson/Benteke) helps keep them decent but is probably not as good as people think.  Titans made it to the superbowl but lost while villa finished fifth for several years and never broke through to 4th  Dolphins are Spurs- a rich history that is sadly very much in the past. Both can claim first that their fanbases hold onto for dear life (undefeated/first to do the double).  Had some talismanic figures in the 80/90s (Marino/Klinsmann and gazza).  This past season suffered from much locker room drama (Incognito/AVB). Plus I am a fan of both and can tell you it is frustratingly depressing, they get your hopes up just to crush them. Also they are “rivals” of a far more successful team (Arsenal/Pats).  Seahawks are city- both teams did not achieve much in the past but recently have been tearing the leagues apart, partly because of their home fortress.  Both also did it by potentially questionable means (city with money, Seahawks through multiple drug suspensions).  Arsenal is pats- had a bunch of success a in the early 2000 that drew lots of fans behind a great player (henry/brady) and coach (Wenger/belichick).  Both coaches have been accused of getting old and past their time only to prove the doubters wrong consistently, but with no trophies. Bonus: nobody else particularly likes you, but nobody hates you (other than a few “rivals”). Oh and they share very vocal biased famous supporters (bill simmons/piers morgan).  United is 49ers- a true glory team. Had Montana and Rice, Young and Rice, Owens, Kaepernick, Gore. United’s player list is even longer. Both teams almost never have more than a few “down” years in a row only to bounce back and be great. Bonus their colors are really similar and if you say you are a fan of theirs that doesn’t live in SF/Manchester people know why and judge you slightly.  Chelsea is Cowboys-dysfunctional wealthy owner who thinks its all about him but can’t get out of his own way.  The owner has had success in the past as well as great players but never seems satisfied.  Always willing to splash the big cash and nobody really likes their fans that much at all.  Liverpool is Steelers- plenty of history, some recent success and are always competitive but recently have fallen on hard times behind an aging squad.  Their best players are controversial (Rothlisberger for his off field issues, Suarez being Suarez). Plus, both sets of fans claim to speak English, but that claim is doubtful at best.  Everton is Vikings- competitive, have some great history, but ultimately have never won anything and frustrates a small but loyal fanbase. Both are overshadowed by nearby rivals (Evertone by Liverpool and Vikings by Green Bay).  Have good players and organizational support but you know neither are ever going to compete at the same level as the big boys for more than a year or two  Cardiff is Washington-their owners are crazy and everyone knows it but them. Neither team is particularly good despite all the money. Plus both need to change their mascots (one because its offensive, the other because dragons and seabirds go together like Smaug and laketown).  Maybe the owners will get it right eventually but probably not  Baltimore is Swansea-the nearby more successful, less crazy team to the Cardiff/Washington duo. Have success when people least expect it and generally most people like watching them play.  The prodigal son has left (Rodgers/Lewis) but they still field a fun respectable team that.  Tampa is Stoke- a history of good defense and crap offense. Tampa once lost a  NFC championship game football game by 6-11 where their offense looked pulisesque. Plus no one really knows where either city is or why you would visit.  Fulham is Arizona- a fun team to watch that has once almost gotten to a mountain top but lost (Arizona in the superbowl and Fulham in the Europa league). Both are in areas where there are wealthy individuals who probably don’t really expect much from the team. However when the team begins to do well you will fine plenty of people pulling for them.  WBA is St Louis Rams- Brimingham seems roughly equivalent to the “fly over country” of the US. Both teams some how both overachieve and underachieve at the same time while, in reality, finishing exactly where they belong. Neither is probably going to achieve anything of note soon and most other teams’ fans forget they exist. But, hey, its still a professional football team.  Crystal palace is Detroit- generally have been toiling away for a long time as a bad team only to recently find some success (but probably only measured as success based off of their recent history of failure). Fun teams to watch but you always have a feeling they are going revert back to the old form and lose tons of games.  West Ham is Philly- Philly fans pride themselves on being “tough fans.” Their old stadium had a magistrate in the building for fans arrested during the game.  Usually have respectable teams but never go beyond “respectable”. West Ham fans are pretty much the same. One set of fans booed santa, another had a movie made after their hooligans where a (SPOILER) baby dies. And both fan bases are probably proud of those facts.  Southampton is Carolina- good teams in warmer places with no big fanbase outside of their own cities/states. Have found some recent success this year and generally can be very fun to watch.  How long that success lasts is anyone’s guess, but chances are not very long. But the fans will enjoy it while it does  Hull is Jacksonville- both mascots are feline predators. Both are cities you would never visit. Both teams are generally boring and uninspiring. But hey someone has to be their fans right? Right?  Newcastle is Cleveland: both have fans from cold working calss areas. Both fans are absurdly loyal to their, generally, disappointing team. And Both fan bases are noted for their overweight bare chested fans in the dead of winter. All we need is a band called “Prime ministers of the UK” to release a song called “Newcastle Rocks”."

meninblazers,2vggxf,mcclobber,3,Fri Feb 13 22:33:48 2015 UTC,What would be a good EPL team for me if I were a fan of the San Francisco 49ers?  -Dominant team during the 80's and 90's known for tactical innovation  -Recent success without championships  -Owner that is despised by the fans
meninblazers,2vggxf,CommonAnon1,4,Tue Feb 10 23:44:17 2015 UTC,"Probably, Liverpool: They won UEFA Cup in late 70s, Doubles/Trebles in the 80s. No recent trophies and the owner is the Fenway Sports Group. Not necessarily despised, but definitely disliked by the fans. I don't know about tactical innovation, but most of their managers are top class. Plus, Candlestick Park is similar historically to Anfield."
meninblazers,2vggxf,squirrelpocher,4,Wed Feb 11 00:11:13 2015 UTC,they won the champions league in 2005. but yeah I would say either Man U or Liverpool would be similar to SF
meninblazers,2vggxf,matheaks,3,Wed Feb 11 02:55:01 2015 UTC,"2005 is 10 years ago.. not really recent, but a big achievement none the less."
meninblazers,2vggxf,purpleube,2,Wed Feb 11 03:38:53 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think Liverpool is more like the Dallas Cowboys. Rich history, well known throughout the world, but its been a while since they won any title.  I'm an Arsenal fan and I think they are a lot like the New England Patriots (before they won the Super Bowl this year). Both teams have long tenured coaches that saw a lot of success in the early 2000s (Arsenal won the double in 2002 and were undefeated in 2003-2004, NE won the Super Bowl in 2001, 2003, 2004). Also, both fan bases are pretty loyal/insufferable depending on your perspective. Arsenal's biggest journalist fan is Piers Morgan and Bill Simmons is a huge Pats fan. You either love or hate those guys.  Edit: Just saw the old Men In Blazers post. Totally spot on re: Arsenal."

meninblazers,2s7q7r,tms144,4,Mon Jan 12 22:30:50 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking and here are a few others I came up with:  Coach Taylor is Bob Bradley: Sticks with ""his guys"" (Saracen, Bornstein/Findlay) almost to a fault sometimes. Lots of outside pressure to put in the hot young prospects. Have a lot of integrity, very genuine people.  Tim Riggins is Clint Dempsey: Resident badass. Small town Texas boy at heart. Destroys opponents on the field. Huge hearts. Both make me question my sexuality.  Jason Street is Charlie Davies: Incredibly promising career derailed instantly by injury. Holden also considered but was more a multitude of injuries with him.  East Dillon is the German faction. So I guess Vince is Jermaine Jones. Both were outsiders, used to be their own outfit, merged with a totally different culture forced to come together as one. Vince/Jermaine the most talented of the bunch and the defacto leader.  Lyla is Jurgen. Everyone wants them but seems to can't have them. When eventually gotten, you'd wish they'd talk a little less.  Saracen is Kyle Beckerman. Not the most flashy or talented, but gets the job done and just wins games. Easily the sentimental favorite of the team."

Given the rich sense of place, the emotionally complex characters, and Coach Taylor's poetic musings on the ability of sport to enhance the human experience and the development of men, I think you might be. I ask because I want to talk about the parallels between Mix Diskerud and Season 3 rookie phenom JD McCoy. Much like McCoy arrives in Dillon, Diskerud comes to an MLS fresh faced and long-haired, young, naive, hyped, and buoyed by the workings of his successful and somewhat shady businessman father. McCoy is beloved at first, successful on the field, and welcomed by the community. Ultimately, however, he proves to be a spoiled suburban prince without the guts or the dignity that characterize the salt of the earth legends of Dillon, Texas. He fails to deliver a state championship and comes to represent the coup de grace of the true Dillon Panthers whose glory had fueled the community for generations. Will Diskerud stop tweeting self-important, poorly worded poems? Will he bulk up like Klinsmann has asked? Will he get stuck in? Or will Diskerud develop much like JD McCoy, a talented young man whose good lucks and privilege have deprived him of the opportunities to develop true grit ala Tim Riggins and Clint Dempsey. Texas Forever. Tweed Forever."

meninblazers,2qng52,matheaks,2,Sun Dec 28 22:03:22 2014 UTC,"Best Dressed Meets Best Hair (Or Lack Thereof): The world of podcasting has almost never been synonymous with sartorial style, and given its primarily audio-only nature, hosts and guests needn’t bedeck themselves in their finery for recording purposes. So, it’s rare to find two hosts committed to looking their best at the helm of a sports podcast, a realm long thought to be exclusively peopled by blue-jeaned everymen. But Roger Bennett and Michael Davies, hosts of NBC Sports’ soccer podcast, Men In Blazers, have subverted this trope from moment one. It’s not simply that the pair record every episode in their titular blazers, with custom blazer patches adorning breast pockets, but that clothing and fashion are perennial topics of conversation for them. As the winter has lain its icy mitts on the country the Men have taken solace in their rallying cry to “Move To Tweed,” switching out linen fabrics for heartier woolen blazers. The little things matter to them, from sneakers to lucky socks to power cuffs and everywhere in between. Earlier this year they even struck a partnership with General Knot & Co. to produce a line of fine ties. That Bennett and Davies also take home superlative honors for hair here is not a piss-take; though both are balding, the pair wear it with earnest aplomb, and it frankly serves to make their look even more distinguished. Though, they would likely argue that they themselves are anything but."

While this won't get you into the top 5 in the second half, they seem to be meshing better with every match. I continue to like Kane's effort and I think this is a big part of lifting everyone's game and creating opportunity. If the defense can improve (maybe thanks to some late season appearances by Yedlin?!), I'm hopeful that Spurs will play in Europe next year (even if it is Europa league) and Poche might even keep his job.

They were great on ESPN because it was essentially an act of self-awareness on the network's part - they knew they were going to have very serious commentary and analysis, but capping each night with these guys was a great way to have a little fun and provide a bit of balance.  Their boot room specials for the World Cup were frankly a bit better.  It was a great mix of their inside jokes but coupled with some very insightful commentary and analysis that both ""advanced"" and ""beginner"" fans could enjoy.  They were in Bob Ley's ""panic room"", which was essentially poking fun at how ESPN favors bombastic sets and takes everything so seriously.  But they also offered another POV on they day's games, and helped me improve my perspective on watching ""sawkah.""  If NBC made such a big overture to get them, they need to be part of the gameday coverage, maybe how ESPN used them.  Maybe sprinkle them in at half time as well - they'd be a great counter to the more serious crew NBC has, and probably would match well with Rebecca Lowe's more serious persona."

meninblazers,2iglju,papoon,3,Tue Oct 7 17:02:07 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't call me a bandwagoner per se - I could show you my tattered west ham jersey that my Londoner uncle sent me 20 years ago, I just never got the games on TV before. But I don't think that was the point of your comment, i'll check out the link - thanks :D"
meninblazers,2iglju,papoon,2,Tue Oct 7 17:05:26 2014 UTC,No nastiness intended at all.   There's a great episode of the Mayo/Kermode film podcast with Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass discussing the support of their teams. Worth hunting for.  I also learned on that podcast that Tom Hanks supports Aston Villa.

I do genuinely appreciate the discussion and the links. It's so hard to find people to talk EPL with around these parts. Thankfully I've gotten a friend or two into it and my dad has been watching English football his whole life...cheers!"

meninblazers,2i7i1a,TimSPC,5,Fri Oct 3 18:01:59 2014 UTC,"Rog's quote is the best: ""Albert Camus had a great quote, 'Everything I know about morality and the obligations of men, I owe it to football.' We agree with that. For us, football is life, like it was for Camus, I guess. Never met the bloke. Would've loved him to come on the show."""
