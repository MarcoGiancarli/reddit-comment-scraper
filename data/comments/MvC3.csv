MvC3,3e44jb,Dr_Lunatic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:50 2015 UTC,"I wondered about the order for a while. I think it's cause wesker/ammy THC is more damaging than wesker/dorm. Also, ammy slow super is a relatively safe DHC. And you can bring in dorm with slow super + floating bomb."
MvC3,3e44jb,GoofyHatMatt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:37:44 2015 UTC,"This is true, I also use that order to whiff punish and control airborne characters by DHCing into Okami Shuffle which then gives me a spell charge and Stalking Flare mixup with Dormammu."

MvC3,3e13u9,bazookafox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:11:23 2015 UTC,"Naw he plays the game too much and knows the match up too well for me to win with my current team and knowledge. If it was years ago I would try and train to beat him but I don't think im capable of that now. If we played again it wouldn't be much of a fight on my end I think. Maybe if I chose a new team...but for now, I think I will just try and polish my team and see if this old dog can learn some new tricks :)"
MvC3,3e13u9,Zaryte_,8,Tue Jul 21 11:50:53 2015 UTC,How does it feel to indirectly level up the scene by making chris ragequit at SCR to found morridoom and to indirectly nearly kill marvel with said morridoom?
MvC3,3e13u9,emelecfan2048,15,Tue Jul 21 04:38:29 2015 UTC,"Real talk, when Vanilla marvel was out, I felt the west coast was far better than the east coast in terms of number of players at a high level.  I remember when they had a farewell Marvel 3 tourney right before Vanilla ended in time for Ultimate, I was watching the grand finals to see someone using...Ammy, Ryu and wesker (I think wesker, but ammy ryu for sure) and thinking to myself ""This is the best guy on the east coast, wtf!?""  I ended up playing him at winners side of my pool of SCR and my stick was acting up, i wasn't getting jabs and I would get butterguns with doom instead of H footdives and it cost me that set. Chris was using Firebrand and ryu at the time and my team, well, with the additions to UMVC3, everything on my team just got buffed to be honest.  I ran into him again in losers finals and ended up with another stick borrowed from a friend and won the set pretty convincingly, just being lame, zoning, floating away with storm, ect.  I remember after it was all over, I went out into the hallway where they had sofas and stuff to relax and Chris was sitting there, looking down with his head in his palms, with this ""i can't believe this"" look on him. My day was done for Marvel at that point, so I went to play Skullgirls and eat In-N-Out and all that jazz. I came back like 3 hours later, and Chris G had not moved from that spot. Still sitting there with that look on him.  I think I made him snap. So yes, its my fault :(. Im sorry guys."

So I just work super hard in the gym so I eat whatever I want and still get those gainz lol."
MvC3,3e13u9,Finisherofwar,4,Tue Jul 21 05:28:57 2015 UTC,Do you think they will include you as DLC for Mortal Kombat X? Or do you think you'll have to wait for the next game?

I might come back to Marvel 3 but I need to make it more interesting. I want to learn new characters and add them to my squad, like Chris, Felicia or Dormammu."

Well at least I haven't seen anyone from the sub like this.

Also for him living in the uk I'm surprised the connection was perfect I just need more practice lol. Ggs btw even though I lost  /u/Finisherofwar

MvC3,3e13u9,Yawdan,2,Wed Jul 22 00:05:07 2015 UTC,so what made you decide on playing the team you play? or more specifically why point Doom? assuming you still play Marvel anyway.
MvC3,3e13u9,Goukenrespek,3,Tue Jul 21 05:07:12 2015 UTC,"No one had the balls to play point doom, I saw potential in him and I always had a lame, keep away zoning playstyle. In Marvel 2 I used Sentinel / Blackheart / Cable which is a nightmare to get in once you have been locked down across the screen. I tried to find something equally annoying.  Plus Doom is my favorite Marvel character ever so he had to be on point!"
MvC3,3e13u9,robib,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:52:56 2015 UTC,ive been.messing around with Doom/Frank/Dante and Doom/Dante/Sentinel. i love playing Doom with two good neutral assists.
MvC3,3e13u9,SlayerJB,2,Tue Jul 21 09:19:44 2015 UTC,What's it like being one of the only compotent/memorable Storm players in the world outside Justin Wong? Do you feel overshadowed by Justin's success of the character or do you feel that you two play the character differently enough where folks can appreciate how each of you play the character in their own way?
MvC3,3e13u9,Snoracks,2,Tue Jul 21 06:11:04 2015 UTC,"I was playing storm since day -104! Lol during the preview events for marvel and been with her since, buuuut we do play storm very differently and he does some things that are more optimal in some cases, as I do some things differently that I think he should incorporate, but to each his own!"

MvC3,3e13u9,Turlast,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:46:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily say my hair gives me my power, I had short spiked hair during my Marvel 2 days and was still a pretty big threat.  When I started growing it out in 2005 thats when I started drinking alot during evo and missing my pools completely to go fuck around in vegas with my SRK homies haha.  Naw after the SDCC tourney, I was pretty stoked to win that tournament and get a ps4, But I noticed Ono was in the crowd watching, So I ran up to him and took that chance to have him sign my PS4 Ryu Faceplate ;D. I went to the MadCatz Rockband party that night and drank alot though lol."

MvC3,3e13u9,JohnPauliuk,2,Tue Jul 21 04:01:12 2015 UTC,"Favorite fighting Game? Marvel 2 easily. Been playing it 15 years now and still have fun with it. It never gets old. I can play that from 8pm until sunrise.  Im a slave to retail haha. I used to be a game test analyst, which I might go back and do sometime soon!  I used Doom because he is my favorite Marvel character (used to be spider-man as a kid, like almost every other kid), Storm due to her being godlike in Marvel 2 and I knew her Hail Storm would bust assists really well (and punk storm is awesome!) and Sentinel due to him being on every one of my teams (almost every god tier team) in Marvel 2, just couldn't quit sent lol!"

MvC3,3e1t6i,GcYoshi13,2,Tue Jul 21 09:11:46 2015 UTC,he's obviously top 16 tier
MvC3,3e1t6i,alanlikesmovies,6,Tue Jul 21 13:00:33 2015 UTC,he's good but he's not where he used to be. he's not nearly as meta relevant anymore  I would say no
MvC3,3e1t6i,MoltenLavaSB,4,Tue Jul 21 08:41:10 2015 UTC,top 1 tier
MvC3,3e1t6i,scrubeks,3,Tue Jul 21 20:21:49 2015 UTC,"His damage is top tier (as well as making most teams deal high damage with his Bionic Maneuvers DHC), but he struggles in being safe without an assist, some of his confirms are rather difficult / inconsistent, hard to play neutral with, and usually requires taking some risks.  Overall, I would say he's high tier, but not top tier."
MvC3,3e1t6i,TheFragile_,-3,Tue Jul 21 08:51:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think one of the biggest problems I see with Spencer is the fact that EVERYONE yes EVERYONE drops his combos. The character is way too hard to be consistent with."

MvC3,3e1t6i,detox84,3,Tue Jul 21 14:41:57 2015 UTC,He's probably just outside Top 10. His damage is amazing but he really needs assists to get in. A lot of his pressure and rushdown takes a lot of commitment to properly open someone up.
MvC3,3e1t6i,yaysian,2,Tue Jul 21 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"Top of mid tier, imo."
MvC3,3e1t6i,FugaFeels,2,Tue Jul 21 12:45:18 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately he's not top tier in any position. On point he gets bopped by the real top tier points (Zero and Morrigan are easily 3-7). He's ok 2nd because of his DHC, but his assists are mediocre, other than setting up some grimey cross-under/up incoming. He does ok in anchor because he always has a chance with a lucky happy birthday Bionic Arm XF, but a good player is aware of this and shouldn't get hit by it as long as they respect the Arm. Also, there's no more mixup after the XF cancel because everyone pushblocks now.  He's got some stuff, he's good, but he's not great."
MvC3,3e1t6i,Joe_Sensei,2,Tue Jul 21 19:33:27 2015 UTC,"Also, there's no more mixup after the XF cancel because everyone pushblocks now.   All you gotta do is dash to beat the push block. I automatically dash now regardless if they push block or not cause they're in block stun and have to hold the fact that Spencer is in their face."
MvC3,3e1t6i,p0tat0_5alad,2,Tue Jul 21 19:55:14 2015 UTC,Yeah..I just feel like anymore people delay their pushblocks so it makes it really hard to dash after >.>
