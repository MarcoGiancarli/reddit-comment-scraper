Also, ""...Eminem, who made a winning appearance on “Only in Monroe.” And yes, folks, he was in on the joke."" Got a source on that 'in on the joke' claim?"

Also for those who haven't seen the Jon Batiste interview from the Colbert Report, definitely worth a watch."
colbertreport,3bsp0v,99drumdude,11,Wed Jul 1 20:54:13 2015 UTC,"Hes such a ridiculously good entertainer. I had no intention of watching that whole video but sure enough, he sucked me in and i watched the whole goddamn thing.   His interview with eminen was hilarious"
colbertreport,3bsp0v,logicatch,5,Thu Jul 2 03:33:57 2015 UTC,"I really hope he brings that style to the Late Show. He still has what made the Report character so great, but less confrontational."

I almost didn't believe this video was real, except that it's hosted on an official YouTube account (albeit unlisted and somehow found by this Michigan Redditer).   The Verge's source is reddit. You could have linked to that reddit comment... or directly to the video itself. The Verge had nothing to do with this."
