OneTrueTohsaka,35xv7r,xiaolirosie1993,2,Thu May 14 12:47:09 2015 UTC,My general aim was to somewhat highlight the fragility of the relationship of Rin and Sakura with my limited skills.   I realised something like broken mirror fragments may have served the purpose better than the simple blue 'action lines' shading I used so I am relying on the expressions and hand gestures to do their bit.  The main challenge was the clothing - I often like to dress characters in stuff they aren't normally seen in so those two get vintage dresses in this piece. One day I'll master the construction of backgrounds!   I'll probably draw another picture of these two together again some day. Comments and Criticism are welcome!
OneTrueTohsaka,35xv7r,bluemousealarm,1 point,Thu May 14 12:50:17 2015 UTC,I see the pinky lock on the middle hands (nice!) but what were you trying to express with Rin's other hand? It looks somewhat strange.
OneTrueTohsaka,35smon,Finalitius,6,Wed May 13 04:10:34 2015 UTC,Can Type Moon just replace Heaven's Feel with this storyline. You know just get rid of Sakura and give Rin two routes.

Little bits and pieces of dialogue here and there sprinkled throughout the beginning of Fate drove me to many a bad ending as I tried to avoid getting anything other than the Rin ending. Of course, I didn't realize that UBW  doesn't come until you go through Fate.  All the pieces just fit together so perfectly for me that eventually it was a matter of course. So to summarize: It's everything! Take one thing away from her and she's no longer Rin..she's somebody who's almost her but will never be."

So naturally I tried to get on her route at first (I didn't know you had to go through them in order at the time). Didn't work out so well, since I prioritized Rin over Saber all the time I got a bad end that required me to go back and change a few choices to get more Saber points.  All her badass moves from all throughout the VN sure helped solidify my faith... and that ZR helps too."
