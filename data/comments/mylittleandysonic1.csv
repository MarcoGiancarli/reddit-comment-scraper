mylittleandysonic1,3dar53,DiscordDraconequus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:09:09 2015 UTC,"Hm, interesting problem.  So if X = 0, your answer ends up being n.  (10 + 20 + 30 .... = 1 + 1 + 1... = n)  If X = 1, then you get n(n+1)/2, the standard triangular number.  For X = 2, it's n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 or (n2 + n)(2n+1)/6 or (2n3 + 3n2 + n)/6 or 1/3 n3 + 1/2 n2 + n  For X = 2, you get n2 (n+1)2 /4 or n2 (n2 +2n + 1)/4 or (n4 + 2n3 + n2 )/4 or 1/4 n4 + 1/2 n3 + n2 / 4  ... yeah, from there I got stumped so I just checked wolfram alpha.

It's pretty damn good.  Just My Type by Simon Garfield, which talks about the history of various typefaces and is pretty interesting.   The Untranslatables, which is not so much a book as a dictionary of words from languages around the world that have no direct translation into English. Lots of interesting words.   Also, my girlfriend says Queen Bees & Wannabes, which is the book which Mean Girls was based on. It's not a novel, and instead charts the ins-and-outs of how to navigate teenage girlhood.   *Also, if you're looking for something a little more cerebral, give A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again by David Foster Wallace a go.

mylittleandysonic1,3d3rml,DevaKitty,3,Tue Jul 14 06:35:04 2015 UTC,"I first saw ponies when I was in a CS 101 class. A couple dudes were rocking pony swag and notebooks. I thought,""Hey, that's a neat looking anime. I wonder what it is."" I was looking at Firefox themes and found some RD themed ones and though, ""Hey it's that anime again. Nice it has a description, I'll google the name of it. MLP, okay..."" A few Google searches later and I ended up on a Brony entry on Wikepedia or someplace else and was like, ""Wut, ya gotta be fuckin' with me. Seriously?"" It was a mater of lurking places and trying to understand the appeal that got bronies into the show. I had to drop my CS class because I couldn't take the co-requisite class that taught Python since that class needed a math pre-requisite class. So I took a Western Civ class. No textbook, but involved doing my own research for in class essays. It was challenging and good, but also gruesome because I had to see some of most brutal parts of history. Mostly pictures, one or two vids as well I think. I was also taking a public speaking class that I panicked about when I saw that it was a requirement for my major. I figured that I would get it over with like taking off a band-aid in one swift motion. Not the best idea. So I had to research for all my own speeches an in class written history essays. I also had a ridiculous schedule where I had to get up a 5 am to get dropped at 7  am before my history class that happened at 9 am because it was my dad dropping me off before he had to work. I was super exhausted, slept in the middle of the day, and rushed to get work done at night. I never really had time to rehearse speeches, some of which where the written script with references had just gotten finished and printed out minutes before class. In my history class it was tricky because I didn't know how to use the database search to get the books I needed for my research essays, so I was stuck with textbooks instead of scholarly books. My professor said my logic was really good, even went out of her way to talk to me outside of class on a chance meeting about the progress of my second essay, all I needed was the sources and it would've been great. I chose the Spanish Civil War, specifically Francisco Franco. I won't bother with the details, but it was incredibly complex to read because of so many warring factions within the conflict. It was hard to keep everything straight. Also it was grueling because it was about war, and I had already seen some nasty stuff in class that I was getting to my limit with it. Between that, the exhaustion, and me starting to get depressed over having to deal with some personal discoveries and being shocked and confused over it, hoo boy was it a mess. Anyway, it was about that point where it was when everyone else was in bed and I decided to sneak watching an episode of MLP instead of lurking online to figure out what the appeal was. I was giggling so much through the first episode. I couldn't believe I was actually watching this thing. I went to bed afterward. Next day I talked myself into watching the next episode since it left on a cliff hanger. I kept watching because it was fun, and it helped me cope since it was cute and relaxed. I felt like I was getting away with something and really enjoyed sneaking it while in bed late at night. I felt like I had some sense of freedom since the rest of the day I was stuck working hard at times of the day that I couldn't negotiate. Music and MLP was how I managed to keep some amount of sanity the first couple of semesters. Also the ponies were just too fucking cute. After seeing their cute faces I just can't say, ""No, I'm not gonna see the show you're in because reasons. Maybe masculinity or age or something, I dunno."""

It looks the one you posted is at least a couple years old, but it's a far cry from what was available the first couple of years the fandom was around. It's pretty good.

Mid 2011, so after season 1 ended. I tried watching some while doing homework, and ended up marathoning it.   My friends pretty much did the same thing after they asked me about it, so then we would watch together. One of my friends made a Brony club which was pretty fun (except for couple ""unfortunates"").   I was the most hardcore of my friends, so they stopped watching before me. As the show slowly fell out of favor to them, I eventually stopped watching.    I haven't completely excommunicated myself, though. My pony shrine is still on display, and I bought some MLP pajama bottoms a short while back and regularly wear them."

Then I must have watched a few episodes at some point, started watching the show with my sister, we both got really into it, buying t-shirts, writing fanfiction, the whole deal.   I was lonely, anxious and depressed at the time, and the show helped fill a void. I suspect it's a pretty similar story for a lot of the people that got really into it.   In any case, shortly after finding pone, I found reddit, where I found /r/mylittlepony, and from there to the lounge, and from there to here after I got fed up that the lounge wasn't fulfilling my need for recognition.   Nobody's interested in people not liking the show, I know, but I don't think it was ever a case of not liking the show for me. It's just that for me all the psychological reasons I got so hooked on the show in the first place started to disappear as I got less lonely, anxious and depressed. The void was no longer there."
mylittleandysonic1,3d3rml,Silver_Star,2,Wed Jul 15 06:43:04 2015 UTC,"i think i found the /b/read some time early 2011 (which is thankfully around when i stopped going to that board), and thought it was pretty interesting how the thread had such a different ethos from the board, with people actually being nice to eachother. but after looking into it, i found out it was all just vapid conversation and people shitposting image macros from the show and i was much less impressed.   later on i toyed with the idea of watching it, and eventually stumbled upon the kym article because i was a pro memer back then. I thought it was cool how lauren faust was receptive to the fans with the adoption of derpy's eyes, and her showing up on /co/ occasionally.  so one summer day while hungover i just veged out with some pizza and started watching season 1 while playing minecraft and just got gradually pulled up into the madness. ended up marathoning the first season within 2 days. those were good times."

I tried to watch the first episode, but it was late and figured I'd finish it later. Well I forgot, and then fandom got their freak on and started spazing about it. I was super anti-pony for about 6 months. It was annoying how they would do crossovers for no real reason, infect things with their obsession, and generally be a nuisance. Me and another friend hated it, we constantly called it the cancer of the the internet and how someone needed to start some chemo. I hated everything about it, with every fiber of my soul. I started to feel angry all the time, especially when some friends got into it and ""forced"" me to watch a few episodes. I just didn't get it, the liked something that I thought was stupid, and I hated them for it.   Well one day I just decided I didn't want to be angry anymore. I asked myself ""Why do I case so much about other people are into? If it makes them happy and they like it, good for them."" I became truly neutral to it after that. If I saw anything from it, I just ignored it and moved on. One of my friends said they had an open spot for Bronycon '12 and asked if I wanted to go. I said sure, and watched the entire first (and second?)  season in the two weeks before the con. We went, and I had a good time. Been pretty casual about it since then. Haven't seen it since the season 4 premier, but that's just because of life obligations/other things going on.   I was linked here from /r/mylittlesquidward like 3ish years ago.

Couple months later, I was on Facebook (this was my time before reddit and Facebook was cool for us kids) and a friend shared a video of Pinkie Pie beat boxing and Fluttery rapping along to ""Fuck Shit Stack"". I was completely enthralled, and it occurred to me, ""Wow, this is from that pony shit. Who the hell has the time to edit all of this?""  Couple weeks after that, on my regular binge watching of stupid videos, a lot of ponies started showing up on my ""Recommendations"" feed. With so many, I had to see what the fuss was all about...

One ""What are Bronies?"" video later, and HOLY CRAP LAUREN FAUST, CREATOR OF POWERPUFF GIRLS AND FOSTER'S HOME FOR IMAGINARY FRIENDS IS BEHIND IT??

It gets bent down which is painful as fuck.  What happens if the futa is being fucked from behind?  Oh right, you can't because it's blocked by an erect fucking penis that's nearly impossible to move out of the way without causing discomfort or pain.  The last thing you want with sex, from an evolutionary standpoint, is pain or discomfort because that discourages you from mating and passing on your genes.  tl;dr this would never have been selected by evolution because the logistics make it stupid as hell."
mylittleandysonic1,3d2ie8,XelNaga,10,Mon Jul 13 00:44:05 2015 UTC,This man is correct. The vagina belongs under the penis.

Why is she still so guilty? Did she even do anything evil as nightmare moon? Pretty sure she got banhammer'd by Celestia shortly after transforming. I mean sure she came back 1000 or so years later and wreaked a little havoc on the mane six but that wasn't even that bad. One would think she'd be be able to accept herself having done serious time on the moon.  Fuck, here I am over-analysing a kids cartoon. Who the fuck cares. Actually no, I change my mind.

I'm working on a theory right now which is basically Einstein's Theory of Relativity, except expanded -- which would put me in line for a Nobel Prize. You've all allowed your minds to slip into idiocy by spending time on this message board, and I can see it every time I read a post here: the mark of a mind wasted. You were probably all gifted at one point, but you spend your entire days looking at dumb pictures of Japanese cartoons. You don't even have the spine to embrace your own culture. What's worse is how all of you so confidently hide behind your veil of anonymity. It's because when you are inevitably met with crushing failure or embarrassment in one form or another, you can simply keep on posting and no one will be any the wiser that it was you. This results in you no longer striving for perfection, and instead settling into not a pattern of experimentation, but one of mediocrity.

mylittleandysonic1,3clt34,Myrandall,3,Thu Jul 9 01:19:21 2015 UTC,"True, but it sure does beat the salt when you're holding shift over the edge of a cliff in a ravine and the skeleton shoots you down (yes, this has happened. multiple times, on hardcore mode). The chest spawns right where you died so you'd have to traverse the whole cave your were exploring to get it back, sometimes it's a pain in the arse to get back to it.   A great solution to this actually would be having the chest with all your items in it spawn right where you respawn. Idk if such a thing exists or is even possible.  The second great property of this mod is that it solves items despawning when they're just laying around. They have a limit of 5 minutes of existence in the world so there's less stress on the server. Sometimes you're too far away from where you respawn after dying so having a chest with all your items in it that never goes away is pretty dang handy!"
mylittleandysonic1,3clt34,iiRockpuppy,3,Thu Jul 9 01:32:56 2015 UTC,Good points.  What's hardcore mode? I haven't played the game for more than 2 hours in the past 3 years or so I've probably missed a lot of big changes and additions.
mylittleandysonic1,3clt34,Myrandall,2,Thu Jul 9 01:35:13 2015 UTC,"Hardcore mode is a YOLO ruleset. When you die, game over man! You never ever get to respawn in that world. Mobs are set on highest difficulty. It's a slightly different experience of course but doesn't add much to the game as a whole. Good challenge.  3 years huh? You're not missing much... There was the adventure update, which changed the properties of pretty much everything. Here's a quick run through.  Energy/Hunger Meter  Your Energy/Hunger is a big game changer. It is set up the same way as your health meter - which is still 10 hearts (20 counting half hearts) - with 10 turkey legs (20 w/ halves) representing how much energy you have, which depending on its amount can affect how you play/strategize. This is effects a lot and is affected by a lot, like...  - Sprinting You can now run in this game. Double tap forward to initiate it. You don't have as much control with your turning, otherwise you lose your momentum. You can use this effectively by getting out of a touchy situation, surrounded by mobs and extending the length of your jump as well. Be careful though, you can drain out your energy meter very quickly. You lose your ability to run when the meter reaches 3 turkey legs.   - Food Food doesn't give you hearts back like it used to (some can still, like golden apples). Instead, when you take damage you automatically regenerate health as long as your energy meter is over 2 shanks. The flipside to this is when you're at 0 in your energy meter, you start losing health (well, that's all dependant on the game difficulty, I think you only lose health at Hard and Hardcore difficulty modes).  Crafting  There's so many more items and crafting possibilities that I can't even begin to explain, but Diamond is still the best to make tools and armor out of and you can still only find chainmail in dungeons. It may be worth looking at the new blocks they've added over the years: Blocks - or discoveing them all for yourself  Enchanting, Repairing, and Brewing  This is a feature I personally don't know all about or use, but you would probably enjoy it a lot. Mobs (and some blocks you can mine) drop EXP now you can ""spend"" on stuff like enchanting armor and swords with unique effects - like a sword that sets enemies on fire or armor that lets you take no fall damage.   You can also repair weapons together with an anvil - now normally you can do this with a crafting table but any enchanted weapons you craft with another lose their enchanted properties, so you use an anvil to repair one high quality, unenchanted weapon with a low quality, enchanted weapon together! You can also rename items with the anvil.   Finally, brewing potions by mixing mob drops and various block elements together to create potions with unique properties, like flame resistance, health regen, and so much more! Info on enchanting, repairing and brewing can be found here: Enchanting | Repair | Brewing  Horses  Yes, they added ponies to the game. Okay, not really but they all have unique designs so there's tons to chose from and breed together, that is if you find a horse and tame it. More info here.  If you got anymore questions, run 'em by me!"
mylittleandysonic1,3clt34,iiRockpuppy,3,Thu Jul 9 02:10:59 2015 UTC,I think I remember playing the adventure update but never really bothered figuring out enchanting and potion making. I'll read this when I get home.
mylittleandysonic1,3clt34,iiRockpuppy,2,Thu Jul 9 09:40:09 2015 UTC,"You will have to be a bit more careful than you would a chest. You have to punch the gravestone until all the items pop out of it, so your stuff could end up falling where you don't want it to. Unless I'm doing it wrong."

mylittleandysonic1,3clt34,Myrandall,2,Thu Jul 9 02:13:00 2015 UTC,"I think I did, but the placement is weird that even when I try to punch it I have aim just right or I'll hit a block next to it. It was pretty hectic since it was night and monsters kept killing me. I'll try again next time to see if that works. It's different from the mod I saw Markiplier use on Zombiemold's server. The one they used put a chest one block down like it was a coffin. The one on my server is just a punchable tombstone it seems."

mylittleandysonic1,3clt34,Princess_Pwny,2,Thu Jul 9 12:17:20 2015 UTC,Getting my teeth white. Mine are terrible :^P
mylittleandysonic1,3clt34,Myrandall,2,Thu Jul 9 12:18:37 2015 UTC,"Mine yellow something fierce because I have to take antibiotics so my face and body don't break out. Crest whitening strips help, particularly the one-hour express ones. They make my teeth a bit sensitive for a couple of days though. Getting a teeth cleaning is best though since all the stains get removed at once.   A teeth cleaning at a decent dentist should whiten your teeth up quite a bit, depending on how deep the stains are. Avoid little boutique places like Neibauer. Those places overcharge like crazy and scare you into unnecessary procedures. They said my dad would die from an infection if he didn't get some expensive procedure done. The real dentist we went to sorted him out for much less, and without there being any real risk of death. As long as it's possible for the dentistry to be compatible with some kind of insurance, it should be just fine I think."

I personally would have prefered a completely vanilla server with a few additions that made the game easier like the treecapitator mod. Now it's too complex for my liking. I'm going to try to run the game with optifine later but the way it is currently is not fun for me."

These comics have spread much in the same way that internet memes do, and several memes have originated in this medium.   The popularity of rage comics has been attributed to their use as vehicles for humorizing shared experiences. The range of expression and standardized, easily identifiable faces has allowed uses such as teaching English as a foreign language."

He learns that Yōko is a vampire, and that she is only able to attend a normal school on the condition that no one discover her true identity, lest her father drag her back home. This secret becomes difficult to maintain, as Yōko herself is an airhead and Asahi's friend Mikan keeps bullying the two of them. Later on, he discovers more girls in his school with secrets of their own: a tiny alien who rides a human-sized exoskeleton of herself, a werewolf capable of switching gender at any depiction of a moon, a thousand year old demon who secretly runs the school, and more who pose a challenge as Asahi tries to maintain Yōko's secret.

Yet they have a master's degree or are in the home stretch of getting one? I can understand people being more relaxed in their day-to-day communication online, but being unprofessional and trying to be a moderator in a large subreddit don't do well together. You get drama and bullshit if you try to mix those things. It wasn't exactly a negative thing about traps anyway. ""Amazing trap ahead"" would be a complement  even if we take it out of the context of being a joke/meme, right?  I was there for less than two minutes and found this. I predict more jabs and eventual drama and bullshit to be had.I thought traps and transgendered people were different. Weren't traps like girly, crossdressing femboys or something? Are they considered the same thing now or what?

mylittleandysonic1,38y62b,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,3,Sun Jun 7 21:08:16 2015 UTC,Oh snap I never saw this stuff. I used to love playing on a PvP server with factions where you could set it so your team could have a secret base spawn point. I know it's too late to say anything about it and would probably be a huge pain in the butt anyway but ahhh memories. I love killing. :'D
mylittleandysonic1,38y62b,CogglerSenpai,2,Mon Jun 8 05:56:49 2015 UTC,"I don't have everything set up yet, so if folks are flexible enough with things it could change. Right now getting my brother just to log in only locally has been a pain. I think I have it fixed and will test it again tomorrow. I started the server wrong by executing the .jar file instead of the server.sh file that apparently handles other fancy mod loading things I wasn't aware. I had to dump the server folder and start fresh and it looks like that will work. Since there doesn't seem to be too many folks wanting to join, just based by survey numbers, there may be some flexibility in what I add. The only trick is complexity and managing that so it doesn't break or something. There will be backups of course, once I find something that works for what I have set up. I think there will also be the matter if folks want to use skype or tox or something else for voice chat. I tend to prefer a Tox client just because it's more secure and open source and is being actively developed compared to skype's Linux client. But I'll have to see how that turns out, I might end up having to cobble together some skype solution with digital duct tape and paper clips. Also a word of warning, the FTB client needed to play the game didn't work on my brother's i3 powered laptop. So you'll need something better than that I assume. Just as a PSA for everyone that probably already knew that."

mylittleandysonic1,38y62b,Princess_Pwny,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:31:26 2015 UTC,"The FTB mod seemed to recommend something called fastcraft or something for optimizations, it was like part of the mods from the list that you could enable in FTB launcher or something, but I'd imagine optifine would work just fine. Now I'm curious if running fastcraft and optifine together would break stuff or work well or sort of okay together. If we use Tox, it's decentralized and won't need a server, so ping would only become an issue for folks with bad ping. I've used in with my brother and the audio quality is pretty decent. It got better after a few updates as well. Just set it up with a decent mic and you are good to go."
mylittleandysonic1,38y62b,XelNaga,2,Mon Jun 8 16:57:50 2015 UTC,"Fastcraft and optifine will work together just fine. However some of the optimisations optifine makes fastcraft also makes, so fastcraft will simply not do those specific things  when optifine is detected."

Focus on offense first, kill mobs so they can't deal 40-60 damage a round, then heal once they're down to 1 or 2 mobs. Try and stunlock them for a round too, if you desperately need that healing."

Edit: Also you should find a good backup solution. this one seems to work. Usually I'd recommend backups and MCedit but you'd have to compile from sauce and it may not even work properly if you do. MCedit is good for removing problem blocks/chunks when someone inevitably crashes the server, letting you edit the world file directly. It's saved my ass a bunch of times."
mylittleandysonic1,38apxo,Princess_Pwny,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:59:54 2015 UTC,"The only concern with compiling MCedit is that the software is new enough to be compatible with my system. It looks pretty current so that doesn't look like a problem. I've had to compile stuff like Heimdall before, it's a little utility to root Android devices. The latest in the repos didn't work with my tablet, but someone had taken the source code and adding in a fix for my type of device. I compiled and it worked right away. As long as the code is good MCedit should work fine. I will test it and get back to you with results."

It's like clicking a flat image and it looks like the main window is supposed to be within the HOMEBAKED window. The main view disappears if the HOMEBAKED window isn't the focused window. It turns out it's an alpha version. The current stable version is 1.3 or so, but the Linux version is beta. I'll play around with that version to see if it plays well.

Whatever you choose a teleport is a great quality of life issue. /home /spawn etc. makes gathering so much less painful. Another nice one is one that cuts the whole tree down for knocking out the bottom block (it takes durability from the axe for all the blocks broken). The sever had a dimensions mod that had quarry dimensions that you could also easily set teleports to.  So basically day by day the mods I would focus on is IC2, gregtech, thermal expansion (mostly the redwire), whatever makes the half blocks and panels (chisel?), build craft quarries, chicken chunks anchor thing, the dimensions mod. Risen and bob was far more involved in more complex systems, for instance they were very into using magic productions and agricultural fuel sources. I never dabbled in the magic stuff, I just focused on getting the expensive gregtech endgame stuff."
mylittleandysonic1,38apxo,Myrandall,2,Wed Jun 3 11:35:48 2015 UTC,"I haven't played a whole lot on servers. My only real experience is goofing around on the Hex-Craft server. It's kinda lame because the challenge was taken out of it. Dying doesn't mean much because you can't lose your items and if you used /back it could be like nothing ever happened, assuming it's safe enough to go /back. While I think it may have been a good idea to reset the nether and twilight realms, it may have been not as fun IMO since there isn't competition for resources or need to trade for items. I'll look into those mods. As long as their forge compatible it should be fine. Right now the survey results are all saying forge if anything. The tree felling mod is a great one and my brother has been telling me he wants it on their the past couple of days."

mylittleandysonic1,36s2dq,DisgruntledGiraffe,8,Thu May 21 17:48:47 2015 UTC,"It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?"

mylittleandysonic1,36gy2b,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,4,Tue May 19 09:26:31 2015 UTC,"Dear Celestia, the convenience of kitchen knives upon the counter is not a suitable replacement for proper cutting utensils. They are prone to harm in the most simplest mistakes. Instead, look around, and take your time to pull the scissors from the drawer."
mylittleandysonic1,36gy2b,mrwoo6,1 point,Tue May 19 10:16:03 2015 UTC,"That reminds me of an old family story. My grandmother wasn't the best in the kitchen, she was prone to rushing through things and got frustrated easily. This resulted in a lot of burnt meals that my mother (her daughter) and grandpa had to figure out what to do with. She was more focused on career related things, as was grandpa. Instead of soaking or using a scrub brush on dishes to get the harder stuff off, grandma would pull out a kitchen or steak knife and use the edge to scrape old food off. My mother grew up and tried to do the same thing as an adult. She got unlucky one time and had the knife go threw her hand at the meaty part between her thumb and the rest of her hand. Somehow the surgeon she had was able to fix it and her hand functions pretty much normally. For the longest time mother warned me about only using knives as intended, as well as taking the time to get jobs done properly so I don't hurt myself. She would use the thin scare on her hand as a reminder."

Tbh I didn't watch this video all the way through so I'm not sure how good it is as a specific tutorial, but contouring is supposed to just be really subtle highlights and shadows to trick people into seeing your face as a shape it's not. For instance: adding shadows under your cheekbones so it looks like your face is thinner. Subtle, but effective.  A more dramatic example is stereotypical drag queen makeup. You can obviously see how they used shadow to sink in their cheeks and reshape their chin, and highlight their nose, cheekbones, and eyes.  Like I said, google male contouring and you'll get a ton of tutorials and stuff."

I thought the first episode of MAS was pretty shit, but within a few episodes, his editing, his voice acting, scripting, the lot, it all improved ten-fold.  The artwork for his new series started out shit, too, but that's also improving rapidly. I'm not digging the scripts so much, but I think a lot of that is down to the fact he's pretty much running a one-man show right now, and doing all the art and 'animation' is giving him less time to focus on making a good script whilst keeping episodes semi-regular.

mylittleandysonic1,368q8k,nightpon3,2,Mon May 18 16:45:22 2015 UTC,I have not seen up to ep 6. I gave it like 3 episodes when my friend was watching it and didn't like it.  I think I'm too far out of things to give it another try...
mylittleandysonic1,368q8k,slippy0,1 point,Mon May 18 16:46:35 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't blame you for giving up after 3 episodes and I probably only got into it because I had nothing else to do one day and watched the first 8 I think. I still patiently wait for each new episode despite the difficulty he runs into.  FiW is overtly dark but MAS is a philosophical reflection of the state of society and that makes it way darker to me."

mylittleandysonic1,35m86s,andysonic2,7,Mon May 11 17:44:58 2015 UTC,"Sounds a lot like my life. Man, back in the hood, or ""The Barn"" as we called it, those cosplaying bronies kept me up every night. If it wasn't their obnoxious neighing when they had an orgy on the street it was some asshole forgetting he was not actually Rainbow Dash and falling to his death. I hope you never know the sound of a human body bouncing off asphalt--or worse, several at once. Shit was cray, nawmsayin? Anyways, lemme tell you about the night I got fucked up on horse tranquilizers and decided enough was enough. So anyways, here's me, just a lovable little Sponce on a lonely friday night, surrounded by got dang horse cosplayers for the nth day in a row, and I finally snap. That's it, old yellers, I'm taking every last one of you out behind the barn. So I grab my .44 Magnum as if I was some idiot cosplayer and decide if these punks' luck has dried up. I open the door: Pinkie Pie fisting Apple Bloom. Degenerates. Boom. Boom. Not even good costumes, I tell you what. No doubt I've disturbed some of my regular neighbors, but I know they're cheering me on behind locked doors, they said they would at the latest KKK (Kill Krazy Kosplayers) meeting. Still, you can't help but have a bit of empathy for those murdered infidels, because really they just needed someone to pull them out of their holes. Not me, though, I don't have the patience. After I reloaded, I made like a roach and scurried down the apartment complex's breezeway, looking for my next victims.  ""Oh hey Sponce finally came around to the Magic side?""  Fucking hell, it's Chad. As an aside, Chad is one of the most notoriously kinky horse cosplayers on the planet (don't even get me started on those freaks below the planet). He's been known to eat the shit out of dead bodies--the other freaks who just couldn't hang.  ""Fuck you Chad I'm done rimming your hay-smelling ass"" Blam, there goes Chad.  ""Sponce, all those nights we shared? Did they mean nothing?""  ""Of course not, you blackmailing son-of-a-bitch!""  Removing Chad from this plane of existence was one of the most satisfying things I've done in my life. Anyways, I go shoot up some horse tranquilizer (literally the only drug you can buy around here wtf) and numb myself to the hellish reality of fending off hordes of futa-shys and creepy guys in Twilight Sparkle costumes made of cardboard paper, duct tape, and acrylic paint.  I had 42 more rounds, 41 of which were for them. To be honest, I fell to their acidic sperm cannons within a single reload. I survived by disguising myself with one of my recent horsey victims' cosplays. And the horse tranquilizer numbed the pain, allowing me to fake death.  That's my story. I got out of that hellhole shortly afterwards. I had to play the corner in that stolen outfit for months to finally afford a box in the next city over.   That was pretty personal, but I'm just sayin fuck you you don't know me, I've seen way more shit than whoever it is you're talking about and that's definitely me in the comic."

mylittleandysonic1,35cjg0,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,2,Sun May 10 01:12:51 2015 UTC,"If they were registered in my state, I'd be a registered member. The Pirate Party is one of the most wide-spread international political parties, though not very popular in most of them :(  In fairness, I wouldn't vote based on my ideal party in our current primary-based, winner-takes-all election system. I'll end up voting libertarian if there's a chance of forcing the election into a non-majority situation (therefor doing away with the 2-party system), otherwise I'll end up voting Rand Paul if I don't like the democrat nomination, otherwise I'm voting Cthulhu if Rand Paul doesn't get the republican nomination."
mylittleandysonic1,35cjg0,nightpon3,3,Sun May 10 06:03:58 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem is securing money for campaigning and TV ads. Most campaign contributors want to throw money at what they think will be the ""race horse"" that wins the election, or at least has a chance. In the early 1900s we had a pretty sizeable socialist party, but apparently due to the Red Scare it dissolved. There is a lot about corporate money in politics on the Internet lately. I'm not sure if that has caused more to hinder traction for other political parties outside of the Dem/Rep dichotomy we have now, or if it has to do more with citizens not being aware or interested in other parties. It seems a lot of people vote along party lines without thinking or researching much about what's going on politically.

mylittleandysonic1,35cjg0,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,2,Sun May 10 07:53:03 2015 UTC,"The Red Scare is a serious issue that I think has negatively impacted politics and public knowledge, essentially leading people to believe it was the form of government rather than the intentions of any type of corrupt government. This is the best summary/solution I've found of the current state of America and no matter what political opinions someone holds, I think we can all agree government has got away from the hands of the governed.  Though I hate to say it, it's kind of the people's fault for forgetting government can't be kept in check by laws alone. I agree tech is the most promising tool we've been given, but no matter how easy it gets, there has to be a general interest in the well-being of any state. Education on bias recognition and group/individual moral liability would go a long way too."
mylittleandysonic1,35cjg0,nightpon3,2,Sun May 10 08:27:14 2015 UTC,"Having better education on politics and the political system should really be a part of social studies. One big part of public education was to raise good citizens and taking a role in how the politics of your country would be a part of that. From what I hear though is that curriculums for students are already pretty jam packed as it is. YouTube could be a good place to teach people though. Just teach from a neutral perspective, and it should be fine.  But since it's more or less just a pipe dream at the moment, we need to get these armchair activist/political people on the Internet to actually be involved. Logan on Tek Syndicate has mentioned many times that the people that actually understand and knows what is going on need to do something. So I feel I need to be involved because too many people make legislation based on knee-jerk reactions and rhetoric. Maybe people got too distracted with the whole American Dream and consumerism schtick. For awhile people are being given what they want because they'll buy it. That or people were too trusting of the system to be self regulating responsibly. It's a shame people forgot that a democracy needs them to be actively involved for it to work. We need to remind them somehow, or outright teach them from the beginning how it works as some of them never really learned it completely. Sometimes I'll feel like I'm off my footing when trying to understand or learn something, but I find out I'm doing better than I think and find people that haven't figured the same thing out. For instance, I took philosophy this semester. It was only a 101 course and I honestly felt like the first essay we had to write about was pretty confusing. It was about the issue of understanding what piety, or at least the trouble with trying to figure out what it is, is in Euthyphro. A part of me seriously felt like the essay I wrote was bullshitting through the whole thing, but I got a good score and found out I actually understood it. Other people talked about how much trouble they were having and what they had to read was confusing. Granted, I was only going half time and didn't have to go to a job like some of the other students.   The only reason I bothered to ramble about this is because Aristotle taught the importance of politics and how it's a multi-discipline job. You need to understand all of the complex systems that we use (engineering), the medical system (biology), technology (IT or computer science), general research in various fields (science), the food industry, the education system, infrastructure (engineering again), etc. People running the country need to understand a variety of things, or at least specialize in one thing and be competent in others. It seems there are too many people who are one trick ponies with their skillsets. I'll browse /r/talesfromtechsupport and find that there are a lot of people who use computers for their job, and that they need simple troubleshooting, fixes, or at worst navigating a GUI or menu of some kind. I'm concerned that this could be an issue for people in politics, especially the ones that want to write laws about things they aren't that familiar with. Lately I've been feeling some sense of obligation of being more involved despite a part of me that wants to ignore it and get some kushy job set up where I get to have fun and just come home and goof off all the time. Something like Pixar or Google comes to mind. Assuming of course I could get a job at either place or something similar. Last I've seen there was a politician of some kind that has a CS major that's been doing some decent things. I'm feeling like I should try to do similar, even if it's just on a smaller scale.  Man did I ever ramble on into a wall of text."
mylittleandysonic1,35cjg0,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,2,Sun May 10 09:24:22 2015 UTC,"I understand, it's something important that comes with much resistance and frustration. I've got my own ideals (such as your point that being a good politician doesn't automatically qualify you for discussion on economics/technology/infrastructure), but social engineering is a challenge beyond the scope of critical thinking itself. I also love philosophy and especially Chomsky for mixing it and social politics together so well, but it's equally bothersome people like that, with so much intellectual respect, are literally refused to be given airtime to a public audience.  What I really mean on better education is give everyone some basics, much more practical life knowledge, and replace all the diverse higher-level education with specializations: A baker doesn't need to know pre-calculus, a doctor doesn't need to know ancient history, but everyone needs to know a bit of ethics, critical thinking, manipulation techniques, and fact checking. Information has never been more easily verified yet uninformed opinions and trusting public figures are culturally reinforced.  At this point, doing anything is better than nothing, but it's critically worth figuring out the most right thing to do. If the majority won't get on board, the most effective option is social engineering through falsehoods but ""The master's house will not be taken apart by the master's tools,"" so we'd only be postponing the consequences. In the mean time, voting, calling politicians on issues, and open-discussion with anyone willing to listen is all we have to influence anything and sadly will never be enough to overcome the well-organized 'systems'.  I can ramble right back ;) I always appreciate when someone is worked up enough to ramble about the larger structures and discrepancies of society."
mylittleandysonic1,35cjg0,nightpon3,2,Sun May 10 10:16:27 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to read some Chomsky now. My class covered Socrates, Aristotle, Descartes, and David Hume. On the social aspect, Descartes' reasoning on the pros and cons of publishing his treatise was mostly influenced by social issues: controversial ideas, being bogged down by people frequently asking him questions about his work, people misinterpreting his work either due to lack of familiarty or cognitive biases, making sure he could secure funding for research, finding a publisher that would actually publish his work, other researchers trying to get his work to conform to their biases, etc. Some of these social issues seem like one of the issues with presenting more abstract, higher level thought. The other obvious issue is that the way TV is set up right now is to give people what they want to watch in order to be successful or survive, regardless of other content they could really benefit from. ""If it bleeds it leads"" is one of the oldest adages related to TV and indicates how old this issue is. Some subreddits also seem to suffer from this. Fortunately we have PBS, Frontline and whatnot, but it doesn't seem to be as popular and it's either had budget cuts or a risk of them. It would seem like the food industry also suffers from this. It honestly looks like there is an arms race for the most hyperflavored foods and snacks. I could've sworn Doritos had ""NEW IMPROVED TASTE"" slapped on the bag 4 different times in the past decade. Unfortunately you need to add a lot of sugar, salt, and sometimes lard to the recipe to make more ""intense"" flavors without doing anything drastic like complete recipe changes. It seemed people wanted it and we have this obesity issue now. It's so bad that we have schools serving the stuff because of contract agreements now. Children aren't going to pick the healthier stuff. That's why adults need to guide and show them how to make good choices. If they can't pick the food that's the best for them, how do we know that we've taught them how to make good choices in other areas of their life? Have we taught them to care?  I think people could benefit from easy access to peer reviewed journals, studies, etc. It's kind of hidden at the library, and most of the time you need to be a college student to access a scholarly database without paying up front for each journal, article, study, etc. While younger students and Joe Everyman might not be interested, and may not even understand, the people that are interested and can understand could benefit. We'd need decent TL:DRs for folks who want just the basics, and let them explore the details later should they be interested or have the time later. Maybe if we had a more public version of an academic journal we could compromise on detail and ease of understanding just to get people started or at least have something basic enough for a working knowledge. It would have to be free and easily accessible. I kind of feel I might have described wikipedia, but if we had something more than that based on actual scholarly material that could be used for middle school and high school research projects  as well as Joe Everyman I think it could be amazing. And make an app for it too, they'd like something like that I think."
mylittleandysonic1,35cjg0,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,2,Sun May 10 10:59:55 2015 UTC,"If you have 2&1/2 hours to spare and can stand his slower-paced talking due to age and some of the soundsystem issues, this is a really good recent video though most of his public debates are amazing as well; he really loves challenging others' philosophies and does it well. Descartes is also one of my favorites and out of the classical philosophers, I really enjoy Plato.  The structure of modern capitalism is very disconnected with the well-being of the public. We're desensitized and all your listed problems are cultural marks of a deficit of empathy. If people truly cared, research on bettering life would be profitable and edutainment would be popular. People naturally want to care about things except it's encouraged to keep the issues about things like racism and celebrities which leads to further desensitization. Instead, journals have to charge for access just to make some money to get by on and people spend their money on larger doses of drama/food/etc to keep the neurochemicals pumping.  It's why all the issues are ultimately symptoms of social engineering, whether you believe it's done on purpose or it just accidentally progressed into this through free-market forces is irrelevant. We've known about psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, and political engineering for anywhere between 50 and 150 years each so it's a glaring question why nobody is trying to implement them for the better instead of running business models. These tools could be used to mislead the public into doing the right things for the wrong reasons, but at the risk of further mistrust in academics.  Though I partially disagree with your TL;DR on academics because usually the incomplete picture leads to obscurity where unchecked biases can make a few people miss the entire point. It'd be a great idea if implemented very carefully, but at this point I'm afraid it'd be abused more than helpful, kinda like how discussion on GMOs revolve around pseudo-science or statements taken out of context versus the other side wasting all their time on issues like health instead of environment or ethics.  To be honest, I have no idea what would fix everything and I'm hesitant on promoting anything, but at the same time I don't want to discourage you or anyone else because like I said, anything is better than nothing or even worse, an unquestioning support.  lol, I'm really starting to let myself get carried away."
mylittleandysonic1,35cjg0,nightpon3,2,Sun May 10 12:01:08 2015 UTC,"That dialogue is really good. I can't watch all of it at the moment because I need sleep for tomorrow, but I do intend to finish it. I'm also interested in watching his debates when I find the time. It was also nice seeing Lawrence Krauss outside of The Unbelievers documentary/secular community promotional thing because I get to see his academic side.  I think one of the things that are causing the biggest effects on capitalism is that much of the economics are based on John Nash's Game Theory, at least on Wall Street. Having something based on models meant for dealing with Cold War conflict doesn't fully reflect what people or society are like when it's based on something so narrowly focused. It leaves out everything about people caring because they are empathic. It distills it into every action, interaction, and decision involving a selfish motive and possibly carefully laid out plan, whether conscious or unconscious. Now the market is set up in a way that works if you are strategic like Sun Tzu. It would seem all that sensationalized nonsense that fuels TV and mass media would be a distraction to the problem as well as feed into it. It's really easy to find people shouting on TV a la Jerry Springer or Maury instead of calmly and rationally reaching some kind of resolution. If we could reign in the social engineering in advertisements, business, etc. then I think we could benefit greatly. In Europe, I think Germany in particular, banned ads targeting children during TV for children. To be able to regulate what we need to without people whining about a ""nanny state"" in defence of a ""friendly neighbourhood corporation"" would make things easier. The whole point of government is to sustain and benefit society and its way of life, and it seems many people either have forgotten or don't realize that. I do love the fact we have John Oliver presenting issues in an easy to understand format for the general public. I think this could help a lot of people get started with being more involved in their society. Another thing I noticed is that their is a TED Talk on love and empathy on Netflix right now. If we could have more promotion of empathy like that we could overcome the general lack of empathy that exists. There is a site dedicated to the Seven Digital Deadly Sins that covers sociology and the influence of the Internet and Internet connected devices. I ended up looking at everything they had available, and I think to some extent mass media has similar effects with the only main difference being that the Internet has accelerated promulgation of content and made access easier. The one article that featured a person perusing things that made him feel rage was particularly interesting. Not to spoil too much, but they pursued such content because the blood rust somehow made them feel ""more alive"". While the Internet has made us more connected than ever, I think some people have forgotten the need for IRL contact with other people in the wake of convenience. If they could have that feeling of ""being more alive"" if they had face-to-face or physical contact. They've traded too much of IRL and physical stimulation between themself and others for raw visual or cognitive content in the form of text. Also boredom and lack of a healthy way to deal with it seem to be another part of the problem.  The TL;DR on academics was a late night idea spit ball thing. I was also concerned because it did sound somewhat like wikipedia, and even if it was more heavily moderated it still stands to risk having the issues wikipedia does, even if it's on a smaller scale. I appreciate your feedback, I wouldn't want to back an idea that would be counter intuitive of my intentions, even if I feel like it may be a great idea, and even if it's my own. It needs to stand up to the test of being actually beneficial beyond just sounding good on paper. I still think there is some larger way of using the Internet to enhance education, even if the kinks of TL;DR idea get worked out. From what I've looked into, a lot of teachers are stuck coming up with their own curriculum. More time is spent in the administrative side of things, as opposed to making sure students process the information. Understandably, different regions may have different needs for students, but core knowledge, or whatever else people want to call it, would be what we need most for students. Different students have different methods/styles of learning. I'd imaging we could use core knowledge as a foundation and build a curriculum for each method/style of learning. It would be a little like Linux and the variety of Linux distributions out there. We could have group of experts crafting the curriculum and let the teachers present without having to sweat over crafting it themselves since dealing with you children is already difficult to begin with. A part of me thinks video streaming could help, but based on the activity of Twitch chat and the like, it would be tricky to answer questions, even if it's just one school filled with several classrooms of students taking the same class. There must be some way to distribute and maximize effort, but I'm not sure how to go about it. I'm also bothered by the fact teachers feel that they need to spend their own money on teaching aids when many make very little, in some cases hovering somewhere around poverty. Teachers should not have to feel stressed needlessly from trying to deal with their personal life. It's too distracting from their job that we need them to be focused on as best they can."

From what I heard, it's going to be close between the Labor, Conservative, and Scottish parties that are running/going to run for parliment, if I remember correctly.  Nevermind, just checked and it looked like the Conservative party holds control right now. The relationship between excessive tax cuts to necessary public services and conservatives are very familiar for us Americans. Right now public schools are accepting money from fast food and other parts of the food industry so that they can serve (fast) food, sodas, and put vending machines in the public schools. On one hand schools need the money, on the other unhealthy food is causing obesity and lethargy in students which affects their performance in school. I'm not sure if you can access it via UK Netflix, but there is a documentary called Fed Up that covers it. Maybe someone uploaded the whole thing to youtube, or in parts. If you are interested in the effects of the lack of a gas tax increase on American infrastructure John Oliver did a report on it. Basically everyone is too big of a pussy to do what needs to be done because of public opinion and conservative rhetoric about ""Big Government being EVIL"" and ""tax increases are an indicator of big government"". Here's a mirror if you need it.  I'm not sure how much protesting and social networking can be helped to oppose what the tories, but I heard there was a movement called UK Uncut.

The Jaws one was a bit different from it, though. It wasn't inside a building, but rather on an actual boat in the water.

Gods, I love being so pissed that I can barely walk, but it's just not worth it. The day after I will know how stupid I've been, and that's 10 times worse than the hangover itself. And if I start sobering up before I go to bed, then I'm in a shitty mood for the rest of the day."
mylittleandysonic1,343ugv,Lord_Ninka,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:39:56 2015 UTC,"Interesting....  Do you regret what you did when you were drunk? Or is this sadness a realization that you're no longer drunk and have to return to your regular life, which is depressing? Or is this just a chemical reaction to the alcohol that has nothing to do with you past or present?"
mylittleandysonic1,343ugv,spearstuff,2,Tue Apr 28 19:05:44 2015 UTC,"I mostly just regret being so stupid when I was drunk. It's like the day after is just one long cringe over myself. The getting sad when sobering up part, well, I guess it's kind of sucky not to be as drunk anymore, and especially sucky not not get drunker, but I think it's actually a very common reaction to alcohol. I've been told it can even induce depression if you drink too much, too often, not necessarily the other way 'round."
mylittleandysonic1,343ugv,Lord_Ninka,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:07:43 2015 UTC,"Ah I get that first part, making a fool of yourself and cringing about it later. That makes sense since I've lived that ;)  As for the 2nd part of alcohol inducing depression. I dunno. I wonder if you are just more prone to thoughts of depression and sadness. When you're drunk, anxiety and worrisome thoughts are greatly reduced. But as soon as you start to sober up those feelings come back. Transitioning from blissfully living the moment to painfully thinking about life's troubles would be unpleasant. It's the difference from jumping pool for the first time or jumping in the pool after swimming around for an hour. The first one is going to be a lot more painful.    I think some people use alcohol to escape from depression. And those that drink too much can develop an escape dependency. This dependency makes it harder for those people to face their depression. So they keep drinking daily to stay in that blissfully inebriated state of mind.     Now back to shitposting!"
mylittleandysonic1,343ugv,spearstuff,2,Wed Apr 29 01:21:27 2015 UTC,"That certainly happens, yes, but it might be true that the spiral of depression and drinking can start with drinking as well. It certainly doesn't make you less depressed (over a longer period than, say, a day). It might also not be true, doesn't matter enough for me to find out for sure.  Enjoy your poopposting."
mylittleandysonic1,343ugv,Lord_Ninka,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:31:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe if the drinking caused negative things to happen in your life, like loss of respect from friends and loved ones, financial hardship, poor personal choices, ect..  then I could see alcohol being the cause of your depression. But I don't think alcohol can chemically cause you to be depressed if you are an otherwise happy individual.    And I do enjoy my poopposing very much so :)"

I liked how Rainbow Dash being angry was actually funny for once instead of just being her general reaction to everything (seriously, I swear she's been getting angrier and angrier each season). Found this to be one of the more crazy/cartoony episodes, which seems to be a mild gamble for a show like this but it ended up working in it's favor. Was very fun watching Rainbow Dash being selfish as all fuck trying to stop winter. Guess she loves Tank more than we knew.  Very entertaining and funny, I'm sure we'll have a few emotes from this ep.  9/10  Song was good too, unlike the last two it was actually catchy and fun to listen to.

mylittleandysonic1,33or99,AphxTwn666,12,Fri Apr 24 07:01:45 2015 UTC,"Went to Bronycon, where I imagine that's most likely I'd find girls like this, they didn't do this to me or anyone I saw. Seemed like most if not all girls went with someone else: friends most likely, maybe family, possibly with their SO. The only girl that really hung around was one my mother met while I was in the bathroom. She had a tulpa and insisted on pronouncing ""Deadmau5"" as ""Dead mow five""."
mylittleandysonic1,33or99,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,10,Fri Apr 24 07:42:27 2015 UTC,That must've been an awesome experience
mylittleandysonic1,33or99,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,7,Fri Apr 24 08:25:35 2015 UTC,"It was really weird meeting the kind of weird person that you'd only think you'd find while on Tumblr. She seemed pretty normal aside from the tulpa thing. She went on and on about how her family didn't really take it seriously, but it felt real to her or something. Somehow it got started because she had a hard time making friends in school because of other weird things about her I don't remember, or that it was just hard for her to make friends in general due to social awkwardness, social anxiety or something else.  My mom just kept talking with her about stuff, and about me which was kind of weird given the context of the situation. That's how Deadmau5 got brought up to begin with, since I listen to his stuff.  The only super awkward thing that happened at Bronycon was the fanfic panel. My brother really wanted to go since he likes MLP fanfics a lot. He wanted me to go because if he got any ideas for a story, he wanted me to help write it. They were giving advice since it was that type of panel thing with famous fanfic writers. The panelists were looked at like rock stars or something, and Ponychan got mentioned since it seems like a lot of fanfics got started there before FIMFiction was a thing. I didn't get enough sleep before going, and loaded up on caffeine and vitamins to get through the day which added to the whole surreality of it all. Also there were two sled dog fursuiters, a weird Scootaloo cutout that showed up at random locations, and during the interview with the MLP cast we sat behind an interracial gay couple that was slightly weird only because the apparently submissive white guy was dressed up as Rainbow Dash and the black guy seemed to be dressed pretty plainly. I'm not sure why the cosplay made it weird, aside from it being MLP and me not used to being around bronies IRL.  Basically it was all the weird stuff I'm used to seeing on reddit, except IRL. What was awesome though, was the Vinyl Scratch/Deadmau5 cosplayer, Darth Vader with a unicorn horn holding a sign saying ""Thanks M.A. Larson"", and the Vinyl Scratch poster I got."
mylittleandysonic1,33or99,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,6,Fri Apr 24 09:03:51 2015 UTC,That sounds like fun. I have to go to one brony con in my life at least once haha. Probably once I'm out of the army I'll start my adventure. Should be fun as fuck.
mylittleandysonic1,33or99,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,9,Fri Apr 24 10:58:32 2015 UTC,"Just make sure to decently prepare for it. I got up late for it, and fooled around a bit too much with the whole 3DS streetpass thing. Check the schedule well in advance to strategize how you are going to get to everything you want to go to. Last time I went they had a little game tourney for various vidya games set up, one of those EDM setups later in the day (they had Silva Hound there), and an over night pajama party thing. There also seems to be plenty of more normal people as well, more than I was expecting. Another weird thing is that there were some fedorable neckbeards there. I couldn't tell if they were cosplaying or just being ironic, because I'm pretty sure they didn't normally dress like that. Also there's this thing about some Plounge orgy at Bronycon, I think it's just a running gag on the subreddit though. It's nice to have Bronycon at Baltimore because it's reasonably close to where I live. A lot of other cons I'm familiar with, not just Brony ones, seem to be either two hours or two states away. I'm a bit tempted to go again to more fully experience it. The last time I pushed myself because I was going through a moody depressed time, and I thought it would help at least a little bit. It did, but now that I'm in a better frame of mind and can enjoy things more I kind of want to try it again. I think I've got the schedule thing better figured out now too."
mylittleandysonic1,33or99,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,4,Fri Apr 24 11:21:03 2015 UTC,"If you ever get the chance. Please go take the trip to go to comic con. It's totally fucking worth it dude. No joke. That was a pretty great thrilling experience. Adult swim booth is the best booth. Got a massage and exclusive adult swim slippers. I barely wear them because idk when I'll find them again.  Really cool shit in comic con. It's really close to where I live in California. Ugh you're getting me hype now. Seems too easy to plan this out. It's only a matter of time, and buying the ticket. Other than that. It seems like a blast"
mylittleandysonic1,33or99,mrwoo6,2,Fri Apr 24 12:31:41 2015 UTC,"I had no idea you could get a massage at a con. Seems really busy and crowded to do that. The only thing keeping me away from a con in California is the distance between there and here in Virginia where I live right now. I don't want to deal with the TSA or flight costs. I'd probably make a road trip out of it or something. Maybe go down Route 66 for the hell of it since it's classic, but also pretty deserted right now, which would make it a bit easier to travel. I hear that they have Fur Con over in California, or close to it, as well. If they're both scheduled close to each other I'd make both of those part of the hypothetical road trip, and maybe add some cons or other things to do on the way over. Now I gotta find people to rope into this crazy thing. And money, lots a money. Gonna cost a small fortune to get over there and pay for con tickets.  I'm working on my computer science major, I could probably use that into getting some tech job in Silicon Valley when I graduate. That could probably solve the whole travel problem."
mylittleandysonic1,33or99,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,5,Fri Apr 24 12:52:54 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid to go to a fur con. Because last time I went to a place with furries. It smelled so fucking bad like omg.

mylittleandysonic1,33or99,mrwoo6,2,Fri Apr 24 12:58:14 2015 UTC,"Which one was it? I've heard Fur Con (Further Confusion, or something like that) was pretty decent, also Antrocon sounds like it's one of the better ones as well.

I distinctly remember freshman year in high school... one of my friends was wearing a Questionable Content (or something) t shirt, and a girl wearing cat ears came up and said something along the lines of ""OMGZ QC! I LOVE YOU"" and hugged him and gave him a kiss on the cheek then ran off. They ended up dating later.   I attracted all the babes with my incredible DDR skills."

mylittleandysonic1,33a7r8,Myrandall,2,Tue Apr 21 01:59:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but anonymous:   I put this on the original article, but can no longer see it. I dunno, just in case I'm putting it here too:  It looks like the comments section has finally slowed down a bit, so as a brony vendor going on my 3rd year of vending let me give my two cents.  As many people, (especially print artists on Twitter), have pointed out, tons of people have assumed Drawponies' art was traced for the last 2 years. It's just that nobody really went out of their way to prove it. Why? Well let's look at the possible repercussions of a vendor calling him out, aka the kind of person that would both be one of the first to notice and have the most to gain by kicking out a high selling competitor / fraud:   If the artist doesn't have the backing of tons of other people, they risk not only ruining their own reputation but their chances of vending at the brony cons Drawponies vends at. (You know, basically... all of them.) The artist risks being harassed online and possibly being stalked in person by his rabid fans since Drawponies has gotten to the point where he has an entirely separate community revolving around him. The artist also risks losing vendor friends that are friends with / currently sucking up to Drawponies. Even if the artist isn't kicked out of brony cons that Drawponies is vending at, holy shit would it be awkward to vend at the same con he's vending at. Not to mention that he's notorious for using his assistants to draw attention away from other vendors WHILE THEY'RE STANDING AT OTHER BOOTHS BROWSING and gather them to his own table. I'm sure he'd especially emphasize stealing customers away from a... neighsayer.   So yeah, basically the Traceponies rumors and gossip stayed within the vendor's rooms and private chats. In the span of two years less and less vendors have been friendly with Drawponies, and now that it's public knowledge many of them are immediately shitting on him. Now you know why, and knowing is half the battle kiddies~"
mylittleandysonic1,33a7r8,croakovision,7,Tue Apr 21 03:14:17 2015 UTC,"I've seen that last bullet point in action.  At one of the cons I've run, there is someone trying to decide to buy from this artist or him. Now, the other artist has drawn for Marvel and is about 55. He is super talented and tried the MLP thing to see if there was any money in it.  Neil walks up to this person and tells them ""You should buy my stuff. It is better and cheaper.""  I've known about this for a while and talked about it with other artists. If it was up to me, I would make sure he doesn't vend at any of my conventions."
mylittleandysonic1,33a7r8,croakovision,4,Tue Apr 21 03:18:28 2015 UTC,"Haha, what a little turd. I went to Bronycon in 2012 or so (the year the ceiling caught fire and everybody died). I knew pones were a license to print money, but had no idea just how vicious the competition got over it.   I wonder if drawponies was the guy with the booth that was always super insanely crowded. Because I avoided that table and visited a quiet artist off to the side and bought a nice little picture of Fluttershy that he drew in pencil in front of me. Best part of the con next to being stupidly socially awkward in front of delancie (I thought I was immune to being star struck but it turns out I was wrong).  edit- wait no, I'm pretty sure the crazy crowded booth was somebody else. I think. Maybe."
mylittleandysonic1,33a7r8,croakovision,4,Tue Apr 21 03:31:51 2015 UTC,I went to BronyCon 2012 as well.  It was John Joseco's table. 2 prints for $15 and a free sketch. He was very popular.  And the star struck thing happens to everyone. I kinda lost it even though I was on staff when I met Stan Lee.

A kid who checked the box next to every stereotype you could imagine.  Oh I also liked the part when a nice old couple at a restaurant asked me to explain and justify what the hell was going on with all the weird and creepy people with pony ears after the waitress outed me as a brony. And some completely random guy actually recognized me when I stopped at a rest stop on the turnpike on the way home.  Bronycon was definitely a thing that happened."

mylittleandysonic1,33a7r8,sprankton,9,Tue Apr 21 00:12:08 2015 UTC,"Well, he is tracing and then selling it for money and claiming he is an artist.  Makes you lose all integrity as an artist."
mylittleandysonic1,33a7r8,spearstuff,2,Tue Apr 21 01:37:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think you lose any integrity as an artist if you traced and sold those traced artwork for money. It's one thing to trace fan's artwork and another thing to trace still images from the show. It's not like Hasbro is selling the ""exact"" same artwork on the open market. They're not. This guy is creating artwork that's not available and putting it together in a way for people to buy it. Only Hasbro should have a beef with this guy. Everyone else should be glad as hell he's taking the time to recreate content in a way that people can buy and enjoy.   And he damn well is an artist, whether you chose to call him that or not."
mylittleandysonic1,33a7r8,slippy0,3,Tue Apr 21 01:43:36 2015 UTC,Because my imitations of other people's work are an expression of my individuality.
mylittleandysonic1,33a7r8,Twilight_Sparkles,6,Tue Apr 21 00:57:15 2015 UTC,"I still don't get it. Tracing isn't as easy as it looks. Even if I tried I could not trace that well as he does. Plus he puts all the elements of the traced content together to make amazing comics and artwork. Anyone can trace, but he's using his artistic skills to create something more. I think people are just being a little snobbish about the whole thing. Acting like tracing is something only a newbie artist does. Even when hand drawing you still use reference photos to help copy poses, background, and other key parts of your artwork. Copying is an essential tool for a shit ton of professional artists."

mylittleandysonic1,32xcdt,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,2,Fri Apr 17 20:17:45 2015 UTC,"It's necessary for writing any software. If you want to show off how bad a network's security you need math to understand encryption, entropy, how good a password is, and how long it would take to crack depending on whether it's salted and hashed properly. Statistics is also necessary to understand those things. Not enough people who own or run networks understand or are able to make their boss understand that security needs upgraded over time, and while downtime is generally a bad thing for revenue, it's better than letting clients' private info get stolen after a breach. I'm looking at you US credit card companies, and store chains.   - a computer science major  P.S. Do yourself a favor and look at Diceware since your passwords are probably shit, Mr. Math Sux. Use the password you get with Diceware as your main password for a password manager."
mylittleandysonic1,32xcdt,nightpon3,2,Fri Apr 17 21:03:59 2015 UTC,"Fucking-A right! It aggravates me to no end; the utter incompetence of a lot of high-ranking netsec and software engineers, the failure of anyone outside of the field to listen to what they pay their employees for, the arrogance that employers have in assuming they have better judgement with technology over someone that's done it their whole life...  If society lost technology, it'd all collapse at this point and everything happens to run on very precise, well-understood, no-room-for-interpretation, math."
mylittleandysonic1,32xcdt,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,2,Fri Apr 17 21:41:08 2015 UTC,"It's a pain because my credit union has had to re-issue my debit card several times because store chains' networks have had private data stolen from them. At the same time though, it's reassuring that my credit union knows whats best for their clients.  It's complicated because you have to explain why security upgrades are needed in layman's terms, and implementing them can be challenging and very time consuming for larger, heterogeneous systems that could be old and held together with duct tape and paper clips. Justifying the cost and time investment on old (or possibly current), complex systems for something that might happen is also difficult since it the people upstairs in charge of the corporate pocketbook may not be convinced and think there are other, much higher priorities.

Which is to say the plot and theme delves a bit more into the emotional ""Why doesn't senpai notice/remember me"" than you might like, but it's fun to watch and meaningful enough to not be just a fan-service special.

mylittleandysonic1,32qvf7,Lord_Ninka,3,Thu Apr 16 00:21:12 2015 UTC,"At my minor, everything is chaos. The entire fucking department. Materials we need doesn't get repaired, it takes them months to change the only light bulb in the pooping room, some professors should not ever have been hired to educate anyone, because the only thing they're good at is showing off their skills. Among those that can teach are several who will pick on any student that has trouble with the hand-ins or showing up, even though it's not obligatory to ever show your face before the exams. For some courses, although all students receive the same credit, and all have the exact same formal goals with the course and the exact same curriculum, the students have 3 different exams, some graded, some not, because of bureaucratic details that can be handled so easily, like every other institute at the university does, but even though they're aware of the problem and know that they've solved it simply just across the road, they don't do anything about it. Important information comes out through at least 5 different channels, and you're just expected to know where to find it. Oh, and sometimes it's late, like my exam dates have been more than once. If you ask the responsible secretary about stuff, the formal rules about exam dates and when we get them, for instance, you will find that she gives you slightly inconsistent information that contradicts the official website's information entirely, and when you ask what of the two is a mistake, her mail or the website, she will ignore you.   Oh, and those three different exams for the same courses? Yeah, that could become six. They have this silly idea (although I suspect them of really just being fucking lazy) that if you are present at three quarters or more of the lectures for a course, the lecturer can vouch for them, that they've learned a lot and can just do an easier exam. The lecturers hate when students are less present (some are every year, of course) and have to go to the normal exam and it is much frowned upon and they complain that it's so bothersome. Also, sometimes these exams do not match the curriculum or the formal goals at all, this problem is acknowledged but nobody bothers to take their job seriously and fix it.  And then I haven't even mentioned some of the worst things I've experienced. Some of the professors there are outright dicks and are more interested in making you feel bad or drop out if you've got problems than helping you in any way. I've experienced this multiple times first hand, getting scolded for asking if any more handins have been announced in class and not anywhere I could find it if I wasn't present or being told to take a failed exam more seriously, and I'm far from alone with this perception. The system sucks, AND a bunch of employees are just terrible people.  And there's more. Much more.  tl;dr: I feel your pain but also think you are less entitled to whine than I am."

The education itself has been severely criticised, too, even by guest professors at the place. Nothing's done about that either. As I understand it, the master degree is still a fucking joke. I sure know there are people out there with it who does work that I frankly would have been ashamed of, even now that I barely have one year of the 3½ years worth of education they've had in it.  You might wonder why I study it. I'm kinda lazy. My major will give me a job, no trouble, I just had to take a minor and I figured I'd just go with my best interests. That way I got a head start, too, pretty neat. Don't want to do all the work of starting from the top with something else."

But having an apartment of my own, adding some things really does make it feel more like your place. Like a cheap painting here, or a dining table there (that occasionally will also seat family or friends). And I would not know how to live life without a couch.

mylittleandysonic1,3236w3,LlamaInDrag,4,Fri Apr 10 14:54:52 2015 UTC,"Judging by the wrist cuffs, it looks like it's meant to be a button up sweater. So she'll be fine."
mylittleandysonic1,3236w3,Jeroknite,2,Fri Apr 10 20:09:49 2015 UTC,I was referring to the shirt beneath her cardigan. I'm assuming that they've tied the sleeves of her button up shirt as well as the sleeves of the cardigan but I guess they could have been lazy and only tied the cardigan's sleeves.
mylittleandysonic1,3236w3,LlamaInDrag,2,Fri Apr 10 21:51:50 2015 UTC,Oh
mylittleandysonic1,3236w3,Jeroknite,3,Fri Apr 10 22:10:09 2015 UTC,I was avoiding studying. I put a lot of thought into it.
mylittleandysonic1,3236w3,LlamaInDrag,2,Fri Apr 10 22:40:23 2015 UTC,"That seems doubtful; if the cuffs were buttoned, they wouldn't've easily pulled over her hands and they were doing such a quick job of it and also not seeming to hurt her.."
mylittleandysonic1,3236w3,BettyMcBitterpants,2,Fri Apr 10 23:32:15 2015 UTC,In my mind the buttoned shirt has too short sleeves which is why she wears a cardigan over it since that's what I always do. If this was the case then it's unlikely the it's buttoned at the sleeves since it'd be too uncomfortable so they could have started to pull her arms out of her sleeves a bit and her t-rex'd arms could be from lack of ability to straighten her arms since the shirt isn't stretchy.
mylittleandysonic1,3236w3,LlamaInDrag,2,Fri Apr 10 23:47:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm, maybe. But if that were the case, wouldn't she have to have her elbows [at least somewhat] inside her shirt, and it would look all fat/bunchy in the torso and empty in the sleeves? But clearly her arms/elbows are in her sweater sleeves at the end, not under her shirt. She's not completely awkwardly t-rex'd..  I still think it's just that her sweater is extra stretched out over her hands."

I really haven't seen many inflation people though. Anyway, we have some differences, but most people either don't care or don't mention it.  A lot of what you post it's things that drive a wedge between a lot of these groups. I'm not asking to completely stop, but maybe tone it down.

ZZW30 made a good comment here where he summarizes my complaints with nice words. fyiad1 made a comment here about how it's not an issue of ""nothing related to sjw and that's final"" but an issue of clearly ""taking a side with a straight face."" Like if that's what you're okay with then gosh it might be time for some sjw pony posts.

mylittleandysonic1,31fikn,Rapid_Fire,11,Sat Apr 4 18:20:38 2015 UTC,magic being mysterious and villainy villains being villainy   did you even watch the pilot?
mylittleandysonic1,31fikn,Balinares,3,Sun Apr 5 07:59:12 2015 UTC,"Sure? Maybe we didn't see the same thing in there. In the pilot I saw a group of characters getting individually tested for diverse but important qualities and a villain that really turned out to be a long-lost family member that got estranged for relatable reasons.  I felt disappointed by yesterday's episode, because the question at the core of the plot, whether being friends requires always agreeing with each other and never being made to feel inferior to others in any way, is interesting, and I felt they botched the implementation.  For instance, how could the Mane 6 getting equalized have been done? They could have had an argument on the way to Equaltown -- easily so: Pinkie and Rainbow tend to be a bit thoughtless, Rari is often selfish and AJ overproud, etc -- and be tempted by a promise of never having an argument ever again. Instead we got lolmagic staff something.  Same for the resolution. The Mane 6 could have reversed the curse by working out, with the help of the Equaltown folks, that arguments can happen even between dear friends and that's okay, and what matters is reaching out to each other, working things out, making amends and apologizing. Instead we got lolmagic cutie marks something.  Starlight Glimmer could have turned out to be a cripplingly insecure mare who had a hard time making friends before she devised her little scheme. That would have been an interesting and relatable motive.  I think the show was better at those things during season 1. That there, is what I miss.  But it's okay if we don't agree about that. I have it on good authority that it doesn't mean we can't be friends. :)"
mylittleandysonic1,31fikn,Rapid_Fire,6,Sun Apr 5 16:37:10 2015 UTC,"a group of characters getting individually tested for diverse but important qualities and a villain that really turned out to be a long-lost family member that got estranged for relatable reasons.   The only one who was ""tested"" was Rainbow Dash, all the others simply did what they could to get the bs that Nightmare Moon was throwing at them out of the way. The only reason there were exactly enough challenges for each of the characters was because it was the pilot, and Lauren needed a way to show the viewer what each character had to offer and what they could teach the  (then antsiocial) Twilight about friendship. In regards to Luna, I don't see how she's relatable at all. She literally went evil because ponies aren't nocturnal. Think about it. Then she returns and is all THE NIGHT SHALL LAST FOREVAH HAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAAH!!!11  Not a bad villain but a bit overrated imo.   how could the Mane 6 getting equalized have been done? They could have had an argument on the way to Equaltown - and be tempted by a promise of never having an argument ever again.   But that would have been stupid. The mane six have been best friends for a long time now and would never let an argument come between their friendship. In fact I'm pretty sure one of them said that in the episode. Over the run of the show they have always celebrated what made them unique, so having them give up their cutie marks willingly for a chance at ""equality"" would've been extremely unrealistic and out of character.   Instead we got lolmagic staff something.   The staff wasn't magic, remember? The cutie marks were removed via Starlights own magic. The only reason she needed the staff was so the the brainwashed ponies wouldn't know she hadn't given up her cutie mark.  I do agree that Starlight could've been more developed, it isn't exactly known why she did what she did. Probably just power hungry, having such powerful magic and being tempted to abuse it. But who knows, maybe we'll see her again and learn more. I honestly don't mind if the show focuses more on entertaining it's viewers than it does characterizing villains. Some people out there are just selfish dicks, and if that's all there is to a bad guy and I can get a whole shit ton of witty writing, great facial animation, adventurous plot lines with a little peril, I'm happy."
mylittleandysonic1,31fikn,Balinares,2,Mon Apr 6 18:04:19 2015 UTC,"Hi! Thank you for taking the time to answer!  I see we're not going to agree -- that's all right! If you don't mind, I'd like to just bring out what I think is the salient point:   The mane six have been best friends for a long time now and would never let an argument come between their friendship.   It has very much been my experience that the world just isn't so good: sometimes you have a crappy bunch of days, or just a hard time of dealing with stuff, and you're not your best self, and a friend does something that you usually overlook but just this time you can't stand it, and unfortunate words are exchanged, and, and, and. So it goes. The real secret to enduring friendships and relationships in general, I found, is not counting on arguments never happening, because RL can be a bitch and shit happens, but working on acquiring the tools to talk things out and address issues and make amends. That matters to me, and I feel the show missed a good opportunity to delve into that.  But I understand we're not going to agree about that, and that's fine. :)"

mylittleandysonic1,31a78e,DRANKLE,1 point,Fri Apr 3 07:12:59 2015 UTC,"I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT that just because knowledge is based on certain irreducible and thus ""unprovable"" axioms does not mean that knowledge is thus  something we cannot ever be certain about. It is itself after all an unproven (and false) assumption that if some concept does not have some sort of underlying logical structure we can analyze then it is not something one can be certain of.  Moreover it is clearly true that knowledge must have an immaterial basis of some kind, even if it utilizes certain material objects (e.g. the brain, the eyes, etc). The very idea of a true or false idea becomes meaningless if we take away any kind of immaterial form that is grasped by an immaterial mind.   A computer, for instance, is not right or wrong in its calculations, it merely mechanically reacts to whatever stimuli it is given; it is only our intellect that judges a computer as signifying the reality we intended it to. An oil painting can't be a mountain, it is only because our minds can immaterially grasp the form of a mountain that we can say that a painting looks like a mountain."

mylittleandysonic1,30uh6y,Der_Verruckte_Fuchs,2,Wed Apr 1 00:21:05 2015 UTC,If you have an Android device you could use this with reddit news.   There is also a way to add emotes to alien blue if you have a jailbroken iOS device. I'm not how many subreddit ponymotes it supports though.
mylittleandysonic1,30uh6y,Rapid_Fire,3,Wed Apr 1 00:27:14 2015 UTC,"I was browsing on my work computer, which I disable all reddit css on.  However, I didn't know about the ponymotes app, so I installed that on all my devices!  Danks."
