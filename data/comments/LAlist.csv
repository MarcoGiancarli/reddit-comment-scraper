LAlist,3dus97,space_trip,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:01:06 2015 UTC,I lived in a studio with my boyfriend at the time at the Samoan Seas apartments. We paid $795 per month but I know it's gone up since then.  I recommend this as a last resort only. Management is terrible. They will eat up your deposit and you will still owe much more after. You only get one parking spot and there's no room in the guest parking because everybody's parking their other car in it.  But my other friend who still lives there loves it. So maybe it'll work out for you!

LAlist,3dlkoz,plucesiar,5,Fri Jul 17 06:46:50 2015 UTC,"2 cents-worth from a mechanic. You may receive more help and advice from a regional Mazda forum. The reason for less than helpful replies you're getting here is that your request is really open-ended. What I mean is, if you're going to do your own work the expectation is that you have some sort of a really basic know-how already and have some generic tools. For example, you should already know how to jack the car, secure it and remove the wheels. Access to a proper lift is rare for the shadetree mechanic, so it basically comes down to youtub'ing, asking on forums, amassing your own tools and just diving into a project once you feel fairly confident after watching a youtube guide or reading the how-to on a forum. Its especially hard if you can't work on the car in your parking lot, in fact - maybe even defeats the entire purpose, since renting a lift and tools is not very cheap. There is a shop in LA area that offers lift and tool rentals as well as classes, I think this is what you're looking for? (I think this is it : http://www.urdreamgarage.com)"

Yeah what I had in mind was to roll up someone's garage/driveway and have them supervise me while I do the very basic tasks.  I will be buying the tools myself, that should be simple enough.

LAlist,3dlkoz,ps6000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the best lessons you can get are by doing it yourself, making a mistake, and fixing it. It sucks, but its how you learn. Do you have tools, and a street you can setup on? You should be able to do brakes on a less busy street."
LAlist,3dlkoz,ps6000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:11:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I don't have the tools, although that's just a matter of ordering it online.

I don't change my own engine oil. Now brakes I do myself, and some of the more involved items. You are going to need tools, you are going to need some initial investment which in the short term makes it more expensive but in the long term is cheaper.

I have never seen him around a cat but I know he is great with small dogs i would suggest a meeting but he will mostly be an outside dog, How much did you have in mind of waiting to spend a month? we can spend anywhere from 600-1000 so with 3 to 4 rooms we could get a pretty decent place in a nice area.

Perhaps somebody has a non-specific need that allows them to live just ""Somewhere in LA"".  Sure, people should mention their price range, but things get missed. At a glance, it seems most people include their price.   Maybe adding a few extra details under the [Housing] in the sidebar to say something more proactive and get rid of the ""yadda yadda"" would help.

LAlist,3cu0yu,TheMayerOfPortland,2,Sat Jul 11 05:58:31 2015 UTC,"I had a health scare a few years back and it really changed my outlook on life. I think seizing the day and meeting cool people makes my life happier. Probably more stressful too, but I'm ok with that :)"
LAlist,3cu0yu,arffarffarff,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:33:42 2015 UTC,"I think I know what you mean by 'stressful'. Wish I could have offered my camera & tripod, but feel free to PM me if you get any other cool ideas :)"
LAlist,3cu0yu,arffarffarff,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:02:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for the offer. I decided to invest in some since I want to make doing videos a more regular occurrence. I think I made some fun interviews with people in cool costumes. The hard part will be editing them! There are no mosquitoes here. I am in heaven.

LAlist,3cu0yu,fireside-,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:59:29 2015 UTC,"I used to part take in greenary a lot and spend the day playing videos games or watching TV. Those were relaxing times but I wasn't really accomplishing anything. It was a low stress environment. Now that I am making an effort to put myself out there and chase artistic endeavors it opens you up to a world that can judge you or be mean, but also allows you to meet awesome people who support you."

LAlist,3ctsnx,Rick_Cranium,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:47:14 2015 UTC,how much are you paying? what are the perks aside from a paycheck?
LAlist,3cusmi,zjunk,3,Fri Jul 10 23:13:52 2015 UTC,Just say you're selling a first gen/fat ps3 lol its not rare
LAlist,3cusmi,l_Dazer_l,2,Sat Jul 11 05:30:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe not ""rare"" but definitely sought after by those that know their PS3s. The 4 port usb and backwards compatibility makes this PS3 valuable."
LAlist,3cusmi,StrikerXVI,2,Sat Jul 11 21:20:21 2015 UTC,Maybe but it's probably sought out as a shelf piece not for playing anymore
LAlist,3cusmi,l_Dazer_l,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:00:53 2015 UTC,Thanks! I thought I wasn't blowing smoke there. It was the 4 USB's and the 120 gb hard drive that I was told was not at all common.
