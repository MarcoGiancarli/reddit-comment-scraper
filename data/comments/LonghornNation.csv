LonghornNation,3e4bty,lrod45,11,Tue Jul 21 21:18:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know what I'm more angry about, Daje's blatant disregard of Strong's core values, or how awful the song was.   Either way that kid seems a little off.   Man, what a horrible song."
LonghornNation,3e4bty,Stormtrooper_OG-420,6,Tue Jul 21 21:33:10 2015 UTC,I knew him in HS and he seemed to have his head on right. Idk what happened but he seems like a completely different person now.
LonghornNation,3e4bty,omgkezia,6,Tue Jul 21 22:23:29 2015 UTC,I do like how Charlie took the time to note that it was not professionally made.
LonghornNation,3e4bty,gordogg24p,4,Wed Jul 22 01:21:59 2015 UTC,I couldn't agree more.
LonghornNation,3e4bty,KanyeExcuse,10,Wed Jul 22 01:11:08 2015 UTC,"Of course, Pat Moorer is the one Charlie puts in charge of monitoring player's social media accounts.  I wouldn't want to ever upset that man."
LonghornNation,3e4bty,UTChem,-2,Tue Jul 21 22:51:43 2015 UTC,"Look the song's bad, but isn't this a bit much? I really hope his strict authoritarian rule doesn't come with a strong backlash by future recruits. I like rap hope that more people pursue creative outlets. Making a rap song about dealing is apart of rap culture, and hopefully this case, that's all that it is. I really hope Strong lets these kids breathe. Idk I just want us to be good again..."
LonghornNation,3e4bty,wiseapple,5,Wed Jul 22 02:38:22 2015 UTC,I heard an interview with coach Strong. He denied that he told Daje that he wasn't on the team anymore. He did say that he talked to Daje about the decisions that he makes.
LonghornNation,3e4bty,Skib,5,Wed Jul 22 02:47:38 2015 UTC,"There's established core values required for members of the football team. He can rap, but this subject matter smashes straight in the face of what the team stands for. Glorification of drug dealing just crosses the line, IMO.   We may lose some recruits but I think in the long run we will attract the dedicated players that will help us win big."
LonghornNation,3e4bty,KlondikeChill,5,Wed Jul 22 12:35:34 2015 UTC,"Saying that dealing is part of rap culture is like saying corruption is part of politics. You're not wrong, but that doesn't make it right."
LonghornNation,3e4dui,OnAComputer,8,Tue Jul 21 21:33:03 2015 UTC,"The problem last year was largely with the offensive line. Swoopes showed flashes of brilliance, but he also had a lot of mental mistakes. Having very little time in the pocket didn't help that, nor did playing for a rebuilding team with unrealistic fans. Kid just needs his swagger back. Strong giving him the nod is a great step in building him back up."
LonghornNation,3e4dui,KlondikeChill,5,Tue Jul 21 22:16:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, while Christian Hackenberg at Penn State is clearly a better player than Swoopes, he actually had worse numbers than Swoopes last year because of poor offensive line play. I'm not saying anything about Swoopes' ceiling, just pointing out how large of a swing a QB can make depending on line quality."
LonghornNation,3e4dui,uncomfortablyhigh,7,Tue Jul 21 23:36:50 2015 UTC,Everyone consistently praises Hackenberg but every time I've seen him he plays like absolute shit.
LonghornNation,3e4dui,squeakyguy,5,Wed Jul 22 00:10:40 2015 UTC,"Penn State fans love Hackenberg, but my experience has been exactly the same as yours. The nickname of ""Hack"" they lovingly gave him seems completely appropriate."
LonghornNation,3e4dui,gordogg24p,4,Wed Jul 22 01:23:49 2015 UTC,/u/OnAComputer what's your opinion on this? Swoopes stepping up and being our QB? Or maybe the lesser of two evils? I personally don't know what to think of this news.
LonghornNation,3e4dui,MochaSage,5,Tue Jul 21 21:55:11 2015 UTC,"I think it's mainly the fact that Jerrod Heard didn't do enough to really separate himself during the Spring game. Strong has not been able to watch the QBs play as they've been doing two a days for a month. This isn't really saying Tyrone Swoopes is our definite starter. In fact Strong was telling the media he was expecting for both guys to share reps during practices and possible the first game.  Really its just, he's been our started, Jerrod hasn't won it yet, we'll see how things look before Notre Dame"
LonghornNation,3e3lg3,XCalibur672,2,Tue Jul 21 18:17:03 2015 UTC,"Always pessimistic when it comes to sports because I never want to set myself up for a horrible, unexpected season but I have been hoping for 7-6 since the ending of last year. More would be great but I'm prepared for 7-6, which is technically a winning season.   We could seriously use one. Any improvement would really help in the recruiting game and could be critical in convincing a blue chip who is on the fence that we are going back to the top."

LonghornNation,3e3kds,KanyeExcuse,0,Tue Jul 21 18:11:13 2015 UTC,That sucks dick.  He threw away a chance to graduate with a degree from a top-tier public university for essentially nothing now.  UTEP's career center isn't very pretty in comparison.
LonghornNation,3e3kds,uncomfortablyhigh,3,Tue Jul 21 22:53:52 2015 UTC,"He received his degree in three years from Texas and was a graduate transfer at UTEP. While I'm glad he didn't stick around here just to get dismissed, he didn't screw up quite that badly."

LonghornNation,3dzu7t,OnAComputer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:34:34 2015 UTC,"I could see cutting it to two, but one just seems like too much. I can see this throwing a huge curveball for Strong and his style.  Also, could you clarify a bit on the difference between full-contact and contact, and whether the two contact days include the full-contact day?"
LonghornNation,3dzu7t,KlondikeChill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:21:00 2015 UTC,"Full contact and contact basically the same thing. They can do shells though and count as non contact I believe. Though this basically means one day of full contact practices with games as well.  The thing is usually you have two days of full pads, 1 of shells, and one walk through before the game. Then after game you have conditioning or whatnot. At least that's the general formula."
LonghornNation,3dzu7t,KlondikeChill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:53:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's rough. But at least they can do shells. Luckily we're not a run-heavy conference, so at least there's that. Whole conference is gonna get run over in the post-season though."

I've always wanted to be a sportswriter, having contribued to The Daily Texan for special editions in college and graduating with an English degree.   I've just never had the confidence to publish on a daily basis and worry too much about the comment sections of websites -- I admire /u/OnAComputer and his ability to weather criticism as he's broken into the world of sports media this year. We've kinda gotten a close-up of the process and I know I wouldn't have the stones to keep at it like he has, and the improvement in his work over the last year has been immense."
LonghornNation,3dvnb0,OnAComputer,17,Sun Jul 19 22:24:02 2015 UTC,Will ESPN Films own up to ESPN being wrong going into the game? All they did in the weeks leading up and throughout the damn pre-game show was suck USC's dick and wonder how long Texas could hang.
LonghornNation,3dvnb0,gordogg24p,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:45:25 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, I totally remember that. They were counting down the greatest college teams of all time and I think they had that year's USC team highly ranked too."

LonghornNation,3dvnb0,beardedbear1,3,Mon Jul 20 03:06:20 2015 UTC,This was such an amazing game. I remember watching it in Japan when I was stationed there. It was such an amazing moment when they won.

But, we don't light the tower for Olympic gold medals, and this dude gets the whole tower lit for a win. He only attended for two years. I find it outrageous."
LonghornNation,3duu17,hillgod,6,Mon Jul 20 11:59:22 2015 UTC,"So, did you not consider Vince Young a longhorn when he left during his junior year before graduating? What about Jamaal Charles? Kevin Durant? We retired the latter's jersey after attending for only one season."

No one wants to buy the insanely expensive allotment UT gets to sell for itself, but everyone wants to be near fellow Horns fans at away games."
LonghornNation,3dpini,gordogg24p,2,Sat Jul 18 05:26:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I don't mind sitting in the middle of a group of Iowa State fans, but I would prefer to sit with people whom I can celebrate the win with."
LonghornNation,3dpini,OnAComputer,2,Sat Jul 18 20:23:09 2015 UTC,What do you think we should put up there? We've discusses this before but we don't know what to do other than create a wiki that links to places you can buy tickets. Any ideas?
LonghornNation,3dpini,gordogg24p,3,Sun Jul 19 21:37:16 2015 UTC,"Alongside that, communicate which section in the stadium is a dedicated visitor's seating area. People like OP will be able to search for tickets near that section more easily that way. I'm not sure how easy it is to find that information.  Have that information for conference foes at the very least since those are an every other year visit, and then you only have to worry about finding sections for one or two OOC games each year."
LonghornNation,3dpini,OnAComputer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:13:30 2015 UTC,would you like to do it?

LonghornNation,3djpkc,bullmoose_atx,8,Thu Jul 16 20:41:21 2015 UTC,Yes. He had 627 yards last year behind MB and with that awful O-Line. Improvements to the line. He's the feature back. I'm even leaning towards 1200....
LonghornNation,3djpkc,Sonny_McClain89,6,Thu Jul 16 22:02:25 2015 UTC,Ohhh the hype train's a'chuggin
LonghornNation,3djpkc,TheNexusKid,3,Fri Jul 17 10:19:35 2015 UTC,"Well, apparently I'm much more optimistic about his season than other people. Honestly, I have him pegged to lead the Big XII in rushing this season, barring injury. Call me crazy, but I think it's possible."
LonghornNation,3djpkc,HelioOne,2,Fri Jul 17 05:18:13 2015 UTC,I don't think he passes the 1K mark. There are a lot of talented and motivated people vying for carries. He's not good enough to keep them off the field. He's not Ricky or Cedric.
LonghornNation,3djpkc,syracusehorn,4,Fri Jul 17 01:43:23 2015 UTC,He doesn't need to be Ricky or Cedric good. He just needs to play at the level he's capable of playing at to hit 1k.
LonghornNation,3djpkc,gordogg24p,2,Fri Jul 17 03:36:40 2015 UTC,I think it all depends on how well he's been able to rebound from his Achilles tear. Hopefully the off-season is treating him well. He was an entirely different player pre- and post-injury
LonghornNation,3djpkc,KlondikeChill,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:10:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with Jeff on this one, Despite how talented he is it will be difficult considering the new offensive look, exciting depth behind him, and what will probably be an average to below average o line. Definitely excited to see him juke some LBs though... and I'm really excited to see what Foreman can do, runs with his pads squared up much like Ricky and doesn't shy from contact"
LonghornNation,3djpkc,FRIEDNAILS,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:09:02 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I think he gets close. We really are very deep in the RB position, more than other realize with Chris Warren, Foreman, Catalon, Johnson and then on top of all that we got Gray. I think he does it but not as easily as some think. It won't just be him in the backfield"
