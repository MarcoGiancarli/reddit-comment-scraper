longboarding,3e377g,rhinocerosGreg,2,Tue Jul 21 16:41:05 2015 UTC,"surgery is only worth it if you get it immediately after the break (usually what professional athletes get). I broke mine last September and they were still debating surgery like two weeks in, they said it would get rid of the bump it would leave but completely restart the healing process. I needed to get back to hockey as soon as possible so we just left it. Took 8 weeks to get back to full contact hockey."
longboarding,3e377g,mrhairybolo,2,Tue Jul 21 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"i broke mine about two months back, and i didnt get surgery. i wouldnt do it unless it is necessary for the healing process, and the only time that is, is when the bones arent touching each other. if the two pieces of bone are touching, its not worth surgery. if you get surgery, you have to then later get the plate out, which means youre really just choosing two surgeries. if you dont get surgery, youll just have the lump, which doesnt affect the functionality of your shoulder in any way, its entirely cosmetic.   TL;DR: dont get surgery unless you absolutely have to for it to heal."

Be sure to get proper rehab by seeing a physical therapist and orthopedic surgeon/specialist on a regular basis. For some more info and exercises check out this .pdf (the exercises are described as if they are specific for surgery, but it's pretty much the same for non-surgical treatment  http://www.massgeneral.org/ortho/services/sports/rehab/Clavicle_Fracture_Protocol_Non_surgical.pdf  Good luck with the rehab!"
longboarding,3e377g,Z1pmeup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:08 2015 UTC,Surgery. After you recover it is much quicker and much safer to get back on the board. My buddie broke his and then re broke it after because it becomes weaker without the surgery. The only weird part is there is going to be a metal plate on it and you can feel it if you are skinny and push down enough.
longboarding,3e377g,jace_zyzzx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:51:50 2015 UTC,I had surgery after a similar experience. Dr. fucked it up because of the surgery. Now it breaks more often because of the metal rod hitting the bone when pressure is applied to it. My nerves in my shoulder are dead too. Be careful. Pros it looks normal and functions normal.

That looks about 37"" long (what I consider perfect for agility and stability), and there's no question you're on Randal trucks. If they're 50 degree trucks, your bushings may be too hard. If they're 42, then you're naturally going to get less turn. Either way, there's a little bit you can do with the colorful urethane bits in your trucks (bushings).  Enter your weight at http://bushingpicker.com, tell it you're 10-20lbs lighter if you want a loose ride. If the hanger makes an angle less than 45 degrees with your board, go with the medium and hard options. To know the words we throw around, check out the anatomy of a longboard."

You could look at other/softer bushings (those little urethane (looks like little rubbers) things in your truck)

I was planning to buy the 76mm variant before seeing this for like $63. Is the extra 4mm worth it? im planning to use this in an upcoming race btw, a straightaway followed by a 90 degree left turn, then a straightaway. i figured i might do better on a bigger wheel, plus it can live longer as my all around racing wheel. Thoughts?"
longboarding,3dz07o,xmasterZx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:50:32 2015 UTC,How heavy are you? I'm 130 and I'd probably go for the 76mm for the extra momentum on the straights (that's why I ride Kegels). Is it steep after the 90° turn and do you have to drift?
longboarding,3dz07o,Earlyyyyyyyy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:19:54 2015 UTC,"Im about 150 lbs, not that steep after the turn.i think i can get through the turn just by carving before it, i feel like ots so much safer.other guys who tried drifting ended up washinh out to the sidelines."
longboarding,3dz07o,xmasterZx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:27:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I can give you a definitive answer, but here's some things to consider:   if you have to drift, a smaller wheel will tend to pick up speed quicker after you hook up, especially if it's not very steep.  a bigger wheel will tend to have a higher top speed, but slower to accelerate out of a drift. If you're just gripping and ripping, they would be marginally better.  a bigger wheel should have a snappier hookup that could keep you from washing out, but if you're not used to it, it could buck you off.    Personally, I'd probably go for the better deal, and it seems like that'd be an okay choice for the course. But don't forget to think about the other types of riding you'd do after the race too."

longboarding,3dz07o,PeteTsar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:27:20 2015 UTC,"I think how close you can stand to the trucks is probably a huge difference, seeing as DTs have less leverage and you can't get near the trucks makes them triple dead."

longboarding,3dz07o,PeteTsar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:34:54 2015 UTC,"No, not directly on top for DH decks but if you're putting the footstop on the inside bolts, you're still standing about an inch closer than you can possibly stand on a drop or DT.

First time I tried a topmount I did not really like it because of how hard pushing felt and the extra height felt sketchy. 6 months ago though I topmounted my Amazon after I got better at sliding and I can't see myself going back to a DT ever unless I just want to cruise. You are so much more in control of your slides, taking fast turns feels amazing because of the extra lean you get, you get more grip and more leverage over your trucks.  If in doubt, buy a board that can be DT or Topmount like my Rayne Amazon. But topmounts are the shit. Just bought a topmount only board a few days ago actually (Nelson Batray).

If you want to replace the cone with a barrel, either get another large cupped washer, flip the small cupped washer or go get a flat washer that has a 3/8"" hole. Results will be slightly different with a cupped washer vs the other options (slightly more restrictive and precise). If you want to replace the cone with a barrel, either get a small cupped washer or a flat washer.

longboarding,3dz07o,Kuryaka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:52:35 2015 UTC,"Ah. Those would be small (#10) washers, you'd want to put them between your deck and your nuts that attach the truck to the deck. They're there so the nuts don't drill away at your wood when you tighten them, which can also leads to stress cracks.  Edit: I'm not entirely sure about length of hardware - it depends on how thick your deck is. I'd usually go 1.25"" or 1.5"" to be safe, but all you need is to have the nylon (white plastic part) of the lock nut on the threads of the screws."

I was thinking this, but and very open to suggestions, whether it be where to get the parts cheaper, or completely different parts. I have no idea what ""mounting hardware,"" ""riser pads,"" or ""shock pads"" are, and if you think I need them, let me know! I want to be within the $180-$230 price range, and want either a medium to large sized board. Also, I am 5'11"" /175 lbs, should that be of any use. Thank you so much for your time and help!"
longboarding,3dz07o,ThatOneNerdyGuy,3,Tue Jul 21 01:11:01 2015 UTC,Check out muirskate.com and pick up:  Paris 50° 180mm trucks  Zealous bearings  Khiro panhead hardware  Loaded drop thru risers  Abec 11 zig zags  Muir skate tool  Go to funboxdist.com and pick up the ltd deck gripped with standard grip tape

longboarding,3dz07o,ThatOneNerdyGuy,2,Tue Jul 21 02:07:49 2015 UTC,"These are all the decent low decks i could find on muir that were under $150 and have kicks, be wary that some slim in the middle or have w concave  Restless: B52  Nelson: cyclone, tempest, spindrift  S9: mini shaka, dropper, static, sprocket, slingshot  Omen: low blow, pike  Bustin: maestro, shrike  Original: freeride  Landyachtz: drop carve, hatchet  Arbor: catalyst, genesis"
longboarding,3dz07o,3_2_1_LIFTOFF,2,Tue Jul 21 02:32:45 2015 UTC,"That board looks sweet for cruising, and the drops would even allow you to branch into light freeride if you ever wanted to go that route. I would go with 50* Paris trucks rather than 43*, it will give you a much more carvy and nimble feel that is good for cruising. I would also go with Zealous bearings, because the spacers and speed rings are built in, they are cheaper, and require little to no service. Also, add 1/8 inch shock pads to prevent pressure cracks and help your deck last longer. The only other thing I'd think about is the size of your deck. At 43"", with a 32"" wheelbase, it's pretty long. This will mean more stable at speed, but not as nimble if you're trying to weave through crowds on your college campus. It's also harder to store. A good, smaller alternative to consider is the Bustin Maestro. Of course, it all comes down to preference and what you want out of your longboard, so the longer deck might be perfect for you!"
longboarding,3dz07o,Zarron6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:25:36 2015 UTC,"Wow. I am astounded with how quick and helpful you were, thank you so much. Do I get the zealous bearings from here? I think I am going to stick with the 43"" board, just because I am not too worried about weaving through people, and I am in love with the board design (I doubt other people find this as important as I do, so I understand if you think I am silly for that). And I added shock pads. Anything else?"

Harbor Springs has some better long runs that get great views of Little Traverse Bay, you just have to be wary of the rich folk and their pissy attitudes out that way.  Most of the ski resorts, mainly Boyne Mountain, have paved service roads and trails that are really nice and technical to skate (try Cold Springs if you really want a challenge in fast drifting)  Then there are always the hidden gems scattered about the entire area, one of my favorites being in Walloon Lake but I would have to PM you those coordinates if you want to know more.

longboarding,3dv6mi,Z1pmeup,2,Mon Jul 20 18:17:30 2015 UTC,I'm probably going to shove this down your throat like everyone else on this subreddit. I recommend zealous for bearings. On the subject of wheels it all depends on what you are looking for in them.
longboarding,3dv6mi,iLikeWindows,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:31:36 2015 UTC,"Ah that's okay then.   I was wondering what wheels people on the subreddit would recommend for pretty much everything. I mean, I'm hoping to do some DH and free riding and cruising. So mainly what wheels will hit those categories pretty well. :3"
longboarding,3dv6mi,Z1pmeup,2,Mon Jul 20 17:07:06 2015 UTC,Most people are going to recommend a larger slide wheel. Cloud ride slides fit that but check out what others say. I only use 1 pair of wheels
longboarding,3dv6mi,shit_master,2,Mon Jul 20 17:57:26 2015 UTC,"Depends how fast you go, any wheel can cruise. DH and freeride on the other hand are more peculiar to each rider's preferences. Try a wheel, love/hate the urethane formula and design, rinse & repeat until match is found. Generally, I go with square lipped wheels for DH/cruising. They can be great for free ride too depending on the formula and how fast you go. This is all going to come back to you, how much DH/freeride do you plan on doing? If you think it is about 50/50 it would be in your best interest to get 2 sets of wheels. One set for DH/cruising and the other for slidey glidey fun."
longboarding,3dv6mi,PeglegPablo,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:00 2015 UTC,Literally any bearings  BO Morgans have held up pretty well for most types of riding for me. Kilmers too. Depending on your weight and how much downhill vs freeride you want get different duros

V2 180mm Zealous Bearings 70mm Hawgs Fatties Longboard Skateboard Wheels   What is the necessary hardware to put my board together? And is a skate tool and risers both absolute musts?
longboarding,3dv6mi,Z1pmeup,2,Mon Jul 20 15:59:53 2015 UTC,Skate tool yes. Risers no
longboarding,3dv6mi,N3w3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:03 2015 UTC,"But risers are good as they would protect my deck, right?"
longboarding,3dv6mi,Z1pmeup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:36:53 2015 UTC,Yeah. They aren't necessary though. I don't run risers and my decks are fine
longboarding,3dv6mi,Study_of_Wumbology_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:48:18 2015 UTC,I would get a set of 1/8 shock pads (I think paris makes their own) as well as a set of drop through washers (got mine from muirskate). Make a sandwhich that goes: Bolt->Baseplate->Shock Pad->Deck->Washers->Nut. That should protect your deck well from stress cracks.
longboarding,3dv6mi,N3w3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:43:54 2015 UTC,"A shock pad is the same thing as a riser, right?"
longboarding,3dv6mi,Study_of_Wumbology_,2,Mon Jul 20 16:47:59 2015 UTC,"Ehh, kinda. A shockpad is a lot softer, so rather than just rising the board up/down, it absorbs some of the vibration of the road as well. It'll just make your ride a lot smoother, as well as having a lower profile. Since you're using a drop through, a riser makes your board lower as opposed to higher. So using a shockpad keeps it a bit higher up so you don't have to worry about wheelbite so much, because it compresses."
longboarding,3dv6mi,N3w3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:54 2015 UTC,Do you have any shockpads you would recommend?
longboarding,3dv6mi,Study_of_Wumbology_,2,Mon Jul 20 17:05:00 2015 UTC,"You could get the khiro drop through shockpads, or I think paris makes some that fit their baseplates.

As long as you can drop in with it, you can skate pool.  That being said, an optimal Pool setup would be a wide deck (8.5 plus), with big (55mm and up) mid duro wheels (85a-95a) and Indys to match the deck width. Powell-Peralta make a bunch of awesome pool decks, as well as good pool wheels. Also try the conical shape of Spitfire F4s for wheels.  To not break the bank, just get a blank shop deck.

Yup   In what was would this be limiting?..  sorry im new here :)   Wedging the front truck up will make the board turn more. If you're running a 50° baseplate,  (if you're lost check this out) this can be a bit much. Considering most seem to find 50° paris trucks to turn plenty. I agree that paris are quite turny with no wedge.  So, if you get a deck with wedging built in, you are kinda stuck with a twitchy setup.   Dont get me wrong this style of riding at lower speeds is a blast. But down any kind of hill it CAN be sketchy depending on your skills.

longboarding,3dv6mi,poisonedslo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:42 2015 UTC,Look into either a small clip on pack you can clip to your belt or one of those wristband that have repellant in them. Both are small and you won't have to reapply/feel sticky all day.

longboarding,3dv6mi,PeglegPablo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:40:41 2015 UTC,I've heard that hair dryers work as well. Heat in general breaks down the enzymes that cause the itchy feeling.

longboarding,3dv6mi,_kurt_,3,Mon Jul 20 05:11:30 2015 UTC,If I were you I would try some hairy sack bushings so you could try different shapes and durometer for cheap.

longboarding,3dv6mi,xmasterZx,6,Mon Jul 20 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"hey guys. so i just realized yesterday that ive been riding randal r-11s and not parises like i thought for the past six years, and now my whole worldview is collapsing around me. on a related note, i need to get a new pair of trucks to put on my chop, and i was thinking about getting a set of cal 2s and putting them on my freeride deck and then putting the randals on my chop and using it as a college cruiser. thoughts on calibers? i was thinking id get the 44 degree ones, since its a freeride deck.  EDIT: i did a little research and found that the 50 degree calibers would probably be better for freeride, since a higher truck angle means a smaller turning radius. so then i guess id get the cal II 50* for my warmonger dk for freeride, then switch my randals to my chop for cruising and maybe, with stacked vicious, some dh. again, thoughts?"
longboarding,3dv6mi,fluentinmetaphor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:04:24 2015 UTC,"Some people like the 44's (or other low degrees) for the lean, but I much prefer the response of a higher degree truck."
longboarding,3dv6mi,TheSupaBloopa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:58:32 2015 UTC,"I mean, the 44s are gonna be more stable, and therefore banger for downhill, but the 50s will be more lively, which is good for freeride, unless I've got it backwards again. At least, that's what I got from reading up on truck angle last night."
longboarding,3dv6mi,fluentinmetaphor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:07:07 2015 UTC,"Well, it's sorta preference. You'll want the extra stability for DH, but depending how fast you're going for freeride you might also want the stability there. A lot of people seem to think freeride only happens under 20mph so you should always use a 23"" wb and floppy 50º trucks but that's not gonna be very stable above 30, regardless if you're doing standup slides or not. So it's more about speed and less about what type of slides you're doing.   Also, just FYI, they're R-IIs as in R-2s, not R-11s."
longboarding,3dv6mi,xmasterZx,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:00 2015 UTC,"that makes sense, definitely something to consider.  and thanks, i had no idea. i havent heard anything about randal trucks since i first started longboarding."

I have 70mm 80a butterballs, and I was wondering if these are good wheels for the job, as I've heard they wear out very quickly. I was also wondering what causes flat spots on wheels when sliding, and how I can avoid this. Thanks!"
longboarding,3dv6mi,Ranger50,4,Mon Jul 20 05:03:26 2015 UTC,"They'll get the job done.   Butterballs won't wear insanely fast if you're just learning how to slide, but as you progress they become a very fast wearing wheel.   Flatspots happen as a result of you holding out a slide at 90º perpendicular to your direction of travel."
longboarding,3dv6mi,gabriel11798,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:11:49 2015 UTC,"So I should hold the board at a slight angle during all types of slides? Also, what would be a good replacement wheel for when I become more adept at sliding?"

longboarding,3dv6mi,Ranger50,4,Mon Jul 20 04:58:03 2015 UTC,Usually top mounts unless they have cutouts like drop throughs. Over time you can sorta get an idea of what will work but there's not really a way to predict that with unfamiliar gear. That's where risers and bushings come in.
longboarding,3dv6mi,TheSupaBloopa,2,Mon Jul 20 05:34:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, okay. So would you recommend buying a bunch of different size risers whenever I get new gear, just in case? I have no skate shops near me, so I have to do all my shopping online."
longboarding,3dv6mi,Ranger50,2,Mon Jul 20 05:45:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I personally hate the idea of riding a super tall setup just so I can run loose trucks. I'd rather ride harder bushings with the least amount of riser but it all comes down to preference. But if you wanted to be safe you could do that. I recommend just posting the setup here and we'll be able to tell you how much risk of wheelbite there might be. For example, 70mm wheels on a drop through will work 90% of the time, whereas 80mm wheels on a topmount with flares could be more tricky."

longboarding,3drzm1,N3w3,2,Sun Jul 19 20:05:18 2015 UTC,I guess I'll go for the lite then. I was just a little concerned because another user that is my height said that he/she felt cramped on the lite as opposed to the ltd.

longboarding,3drzm1,AndTheyAllKnowTricky,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:46:44 2015 UTC,I am planning to learn how to ride a skateboard. Small cruisers to be precise. I just want to go fast and go from Point A to Point B as fast as possible (I'm commuting). I was looking at the penny board as well as the penny nickel but many told me not to get it for various reasons. Can anyone recommend me something nice? I'm willing to spend cash on quality.
longboarding,3drzm1,rawryrawr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:23:01 2015 UTC,Alright man ive always been obsessed with minis my first board was a plastic mini wjen i was 4. Heres my opnion on some minis. The penny man it is fun to ride the narrow width and short length make it really portable but to avoid alot of flex your forced to ride on top of the bolts. Also if ypu push mongo trying to push on this is going to end bad. I wouldnt recommend it for any pushing over 5 mile your feet will cramp also if ypu plan on doing anything but cruising youll need to add grip. A rayne mini is the mini you get if ypu want to do higher speed stuff the wider width and longer length make it ideal for ripping down hill. The concave hugs your feet and keeps them from slippung when you do slides. They dont have a kick to help get up curbs but you can easily early grab over anything. Ive ridden the dinghy a bit and i loved the concave the big tail makes ypu lose some of the efp but its nice for popping off curbs and manuals. I just got a tugboat and out of all the minis its been my favorite its nice and wide where ypu need it to be and also tapers at the trucks to put narrower trucks for more turnyness the concave is really awespme hugs your feet really well and it has a really mellow w its so mellow i cant really feel it with my shoes on but riding barefoot you will notice it. The kick tail is enough to pop ollies but isnt so big that it cramps your stance.  Edit:sorry for grammar and shit

I'm not very good at reviews so, I'll just copy pasta the one /u/jap_paj gave me, this review is dead perfect.  I have the 78a. Not too deep into them, but they're fully broken in and down a few mm. So far, they're exactly as advertised. The lips are waaaaaaay round and the urethane is FRF 727 formula, which makes them essentially ignore pavement condition. I skated them on a mixture of fresh tar and crazy chunder, and they were remarkably predictable throughout. Since they are 727, they do kill some speed, so I wouldn't suggest them if you're only after the longest slide contest at a jam. For faster stuff and runs that require speed checks throughout though, they're just the best. The slide is dead smooth at any speed, the kickout is effortless if you deweight the board, but defined if you carve into the slide, and the hookup is predictable enough to count down out loud. There aren't many wheels that I'm planning on buying again, as I love trying out new stuff, but these are actually on my re-order list. As for which duro, the formula is glide-y enough that I don't think you really need the 80a. The 78a was pretty much perfection in my eyes, (5'10"" 155lbs, Rayne Mothership, Atlas / cRonins).

longboarding,3dp1lj,TheChosenHalfBlood,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:15:04 2015 UTC,"Its been great so far. Its pretty light and the concave really locks your feet in (although im coming from a jet tomahawk x with skate grip and practically no concave). There are micro drops right at the bolts and a subtle w which feels like just the right amount. Id say my only concern has been durability. My jet has gone into many curbs in the year that ive had it, often at speed, and its barely even dinged up. Just yesterday i fell going into a coleman (my glove snagged) and my tomahawk went flying into and dented a telephone pole. On the other hand the shrike got some decent dings the first day i had it just from throwing it in the back of the car on top of some other boards. Imo the wood seems softer. But other than that im really happy with it."

longboarding,3dojm8,alabama_batman,3,Sat Jul 18 03:47:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah. And if you buy hardware from other places, it's like $1.30 for a pack of 5 bolts (buy two) and then lock nuts are $4-5 for a big pack. Slightly cheaper in the long run.  And the only bolts I could find were panhead, not countersink like Khiro's."
longboarding,3dojm8,Kuryaka,2,Sat Jul 18 19:50:52 2015 UTC,"This is cool, and I laughed pretty hard at some of the pictures on the site, but for $4-6 you could go to a hardware store and get like four sets of nuts and bolts. Buying anyone's hardware, not just these guys, is a terrible deal.  Notable exception: those Rogers' Bros bolts that are bracketed together and don't need a screwdriver."
longboarding,3dojm8,zenbuddhistdog,2,Sat Jul 18 20:13:34 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I'm talking about - ""other places"" means hardware stores. I was a bit surprised by the price tag as well, especially since it only cost about 2 times as much for 5 times the bolts and lock nuts.  Everyone makes a killing on small amounts of hardware. Skate companies sell stuff that's colored, compatible, and in the right amounts, for little extra cost. And when you're a grom not wanting to get a ride to the hardware store, it's not a bad deal."
longboarding,3dojm8,Kuryaka,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:26:00 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about the Harbor-Freight kind of store where you can only buy parts in plastic boxes and stuff, though? When I go to the local Ace they have an aisle with bins and bins of bolts and stuff, so I can choose from panhead, flathead, black, silver, etc for every length from 0.5"" to 3"". If you're super lucky, and look like you know what you're doing, I've had sales associates give me contractor rates on my hardware, so it ends up being like $4 for a good solid pound of metal."
longboarding,3dojm8,zenbuddhistdog,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:27:50 2015 UTC,"Ace is awesome, though they don't have as many cheap work gloves or Corian samples for me to snatch sample.   I went to Lowes and Home Depot for the things I mentioned.  Even at my local Ace/Osh with the hardware bins, I don't remember seeing lock nuts or flatheads for individual purchase, and the smallest sizes in the bins were 1/4"". That said, the last time I went there for parts I was getting #6 screws for Nerf homemades so I probably overlooked things."
longboarding,3dojm8,Kuryaka,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:34:24 2015 UTC,"To be honest, Costco is your best bet for gloves. I don't have a nice pristine pair to show off, but their regular old leather work gloves are stupid-easy to open up and machine-sew velcro onto to make better-than-hot-glue gloves. 3pair for $20 + velcro + nylon flat cord if you want to make wrist straps."
longboarding,3dojm8,zenbuddhistdog,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:53:14 2015 UTC,"I don't use hot glue for my gloves - just adhesive-backed Velcro. The pair that I personally use is a pair of batting gloves (so comfortable and soft) and I picked up some super cheap ones ($2-3 each) for general-purpose use as well as backup slide gloves.  They're not as durable as thicker leather, but at the speeds I go at (barely breaking 30, generally just cruising around a very hilly campus) they're fine."

They'll get the job done, but not really excel at anything.  If you think downhill, freeriding (slides), or freestyle tricks are appealing and you might want to branch out from cruising i'd strongly recommend something else.   Wood > plastic.

Plus they have 5mm(?) of rake that makes them really responsive. They're stable too; I've bombed hills at 55, no problem. I've never had wobbles because of speed, just by terrible pavement or un-tightened kingpin nuts. haha.   They're unique because they're super low, so you can have them topmounted and still be drop-though height. Obviously, if you've got big wheels and a non-cutout board you'll probably need a riser, but this allows me to play with different wedges and tune my setup without making my board massively tall (40° plates coming soon?). I know people riding 70mm wheels with no riser or just a thin shock pad, so it's really only a problem if you've got super floppy trucks or race wheels IME."

It also helps that they're the companies pushing out new and inventive designs like fatbottom construction, unbelieveium (the shit the NLS is made of?), crazy wheel flares and concave, etc. Churchill's are basic and a beginner can both afford them and live without crazy top of the line features.

They do kill a bit of speed for a beginner wheel but I would think that the 82s wouldnt kill as much.

I planned everything I was buying based n growing a little and gaining some weight (I'm pretty skinny). But, not ever two months later, and I've already bought another deck and 3 sets of wheels haha. I'd say spring for whatever is going to be easiest for you to learn on now, because if you go for something that is uncomfortably sized, it'll be a lot harder to learn. Plus, if you end up loving longboarding, you can always just replace the deck itself with something you like better for your favorite dicipline, or just better sized in general."

longboarding,3donex,Marshmalllowman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:48:49 2015 UTC,"Wha do yall think of of a board made with a vlam / Ply combo? So a core of 1/4 inch bamboo, two 1/16 plys of poplar on top and 3 bottom (so a total of 5 plys of poplar) with a ply of biaxal fibreglass on the top.    How do yall think that would feel?  Durability? Is it a workable concept? Weight? Finally, would yall buy it?"
longboarding,3donex,rawryrawr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:10:46 2015 UTC,Here's my thoughts on the materials you plab on using. 1/4 inch of any wood is pretty difficult to bend you'll be lucky to get a mellow radial concave. Poplar by itself is too soft for skating it will chip dent crack hitting a curb even at lower speeds. Also your hardware would dig into your deck and probably go all the way to the bamboo without washers. I suggest just getting 1/8 baltic birch and using the biaxal on the top and bottom of your deck.
longboarding,3donex,Marshmalllowman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:28:34 2015 UTC,"The 1/4 Bamboo is only going to be in the middle for Vertical strength , so I don't see much of a problem with that. What do you think of a Poplar / Birch combo? So poplar in the center cores but maple / birch on the outer layers? If that wouldn't work, could I buy 1/16 Baltic birch instead  Edit: Could Red Oak possibly be used for the outside layers?"
longboarding,3donex,rawryrawr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:57:54 2015 UTC,If your dead set on poplar i would put it on the outside. Just because i wouldnt trust it to not sag/crack in the middle. I rather have chiped and dented outer layers that a cracked core. That being said i havent used poplar at all so im not sure how it would do in the middle of the deck. You could use red oak as the top and bottom for aesthetics.
longboarding,3donex,Marshmalllowman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:19:43 2015 UTC,What got me on to poplar was I saw that Neversummer (who in terms of tech are equal to rayne) used poplar and fiberglass in their boards.
longboarding,3donex,rawryrawr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:26:36 2015 UTC,They probably only use 2 plies of poplar. A board made of mostly poplar or just poplar would still be too weak. The fiberglass is added for strength. But if your only going to use two plies I say just get rid of the poplar and use the birch no need to add more things that could go wrong just to save a couple of grams of weight.
longboarding,3donex,gabriel11798,0,Sat Jul 18 16:53:17 2015 UTC,Doesn't the rayne whip use vlam bamboo with maple plies?

longboarding,3dkszo,_Neil_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:52:39 2015 UTC,Tomahawk fits that perfectly but in your price range the longbeard  is better than the venture imo
longboarding,3dkszo,quantum_dick,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:27:37 2015 UTC,"If by ""tessie without w concave"" you mean ""a solid do it all board without w concave"" the Venture will get the job done. They're not that similar but they're both big DK's that can handle most disciplines. Construction and wheelbases are different, in addition to truck wedging and kick shape/size. Not sure if cutting down the kicks is a great idea especially if you're doing freestyle. Could be wrong though.   Definitely not a bad pick, especially for the price."

You might not be able to use it, but if you are able to and you didn't end up bringing it that would suck.   Most airlines let you bring skateboards.

longboarding,3dkszo,anewsubject,2,Fri Jul 17 18:17:27 2015 UTC,"Well if you are going to freeride... you might want a different board. This board isn't really meant for freeriding.   Reason:   its made of bamboo, bamboo is normally flex which isn't something you want for faster speeds Trucks are no name, and probably come with bad bushings -- therefore the control of your ride will be kind of shifty  wheels no name brand, not typically know for a good free riding experience   Overall, your deck is really just designed for a college kid who likes to cruise to and from campus. If you want to freeride I recommend buying used parts off of craigslist or reddit and build a better setup designed for freeriding.  That being said you could freeride this, it might be hard though. I learned how to freeride on a Loaded Tin Tien, with paris trucks, and like loaded stims. Not the best setup but I learn from it, once I understood longboarding more I sold it and bought better equipment.  EDIT: If you can return it like /u/IHAveASecondPenis (lol wtf that name though) said then you should; save up around $200 and get a great setup you can enjoy for a longtime"

Once they're on, they don't go anywhere and they have a big hardcap for careening safely across the pavement. I weigh about 190 and they are very snug, so if you're larger than that they may not work but they've been great for me so far.

longboarding,3dkszo,quantum_dick,2,Fri Jul 17 18:00:34 2015 UTC,"Great board, can do it all. Construction rocks too. Just make sure you pick up some 180mm Paris V2 43* trucks, because the Tesseract was designed around them. 50* trucks won't feel as nice.

longboarding,3dkszo,anewsubject,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:58:53 2015 UTC,"I had the DK Tessi and would absolutely recommend it for a beginner. The design is very versatile and would allow you to try all sorts of riding like downhill, freeride, dancing, and even street tricks. An added bonus is the the durability of the board, it should last all the abuse you are going to put it through learning on it.  How I would set it up:  Trucks - Caliber 44 or Paris 43 -- if you got really money to blow I would invest in Cronin, those were my favorite on the tessi.  Wheels - Blood Orange Morgan 82a (WHITE not black) for all around fun, Lil hoots for super slidy fun wheels, James Kelly RAD wheels for DH. (Those were the three wheels I rode on the deck, before I traded it)"

longboarding,3dj2n7,alvaroaze,3,Thu Jul 16 18:01:58 2015 UTC,"Yes it is! I use it for freeriding, but it's really sturdy and heavy so with some good rkp trucks it would be an amazing dh setup also. As for the concave it has a subtle micro drop right before both mounting holes that you can't see well but you defiantly feel when riding so you get a good idea where you are on the board as well as a nice subtle wedge for toesides. The wheel wells are amazing though and Imo are better than the ones on the batray. Hope I helped"

Don't have any friends that skateboard, so hence no one to tell that would give a damn, so thought I'd get it out of my system here.  Anyway, 34yo that's been skating for 3 months (coming from snowboarding).  Started with a Switch 40 (Landyachtz drop deck, no kicks), decided to get into flatground tricks on a street deck after a couple weeks on the longboard, stepped back on the Switch for a couple sessions recently and throughly enjoyed carving the trails at the park near my house, but I miss the kicks.    I looked around and considered a lot of stuff with an eye towards reusing my Paris 180s (after doing so, I think I'm going to be one of those people that accumulates a lot of different types of boards), and ultimately landed on the Maestro as a good tweener.  One of the few tricks I can do on my street deck is a shuvit, so it will be sick to throw some down in between carving.  I think realistically, longboarding tricks are more obtainable for me coming into things this late (not that they don't require as much skill, but they seem to put the ankles at slight less risk and thus simply don't freak me out as much as trying to ollie at speed (I just recently sprained my ankle).  Don't plan to give up the street deck, but an old man needs a break every now and then (and generally nice to mix things up).  Speaking of different types of boards - the Gravity 40"" Brad Edwards looks sick...then there's the Bustin' Yo Face...so many Comet Boards I want.

Better yet scan the entire hill to avoid target fixation."

longboarding,3dgtxg,sisyphus99,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:52:29 2015 UTC,Tucking is also meant for maximum aerodynamics and getting in that position offsets your balance a fair bit if you're new and still get death wobbles.

longboarding,3dgtxg,morriscode__,2,Thu Jul 16 21:12:17 2015 UTC,"A tuck is for aerodynamics. Speed wobbles happen when you have your weight in the back and your rear truck starts turning more then your front. So keep your weight in the front and you should feel more stable. Also tight trucks don't help, when you compress the bushing to much it will be more prone to wobbles. The solution is to get bushings that fit your weight so you don't need to overtighten your trucks."

longboarding,3dgtxg,Z1pmeup,2,Thu Jul 16 17:16:24 2015 UTC,You guys are really helpful so I think I'm just gonna keep asking you questions: I ride regular and when I carve I put more weight on my left/front foot to turn left and more weight on my right/back foot to turn right- is this improper weight distribution or bad technique? I have an easier time doing toe side carves than heelside and I think this has something to do with that.
longboarding,3dgtxg,ausername1,2,Thu Jul 16 16:40:54 2015 UTC,It's probably more your stance then your weight disbursement. If your toes hang more then your heels your toesides will be easier the heelsides. Just try to get your stance more even so if you get in a sticky situation you can turn either way out of it.
longboarding,3dgtxg,psych0ranger,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:06:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't put a lot of thought into weight placement when carving.  I just try to get all snakey with it is the only way I can describe it.  I lead with my upper body and the rest just sort of follows for me.  For heelside I think the feeling is a bit like leaning back and turning my shoulders at the same time.  I do tend to put weight on my back heel as I do that, come to think of it.  Unsure if that's considered ""proper"" technique or not."
longboarding,3dgtxg,meowfuryz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:53:47 2015 UTC,At least when I do it I bend my knees a lot to help and let the force of turning keep me up. All that really matters is that you can do it though

Then my next board was a custom made one by a guy who saw the ""crash"" and replaced it for me after he found out the guy gave me the local Chinese's phone number, that one broke when I was living in NZ (nose crack from water logging)  For Protection I am getting a Brainsaver on monday when I get paid for the time being I plan on just cruising for the time being. I am looking into some gloves, most likely the ones linked if I can find them at a store, saddly a lot of the skate stores around here are Zuimez and Tillys.

One little thing that ticked me off is that they don't come with pucks when the product page says they do.  When you get whichever gloves, its a good idea to layer the fingers/thumbs with a couple pieces of duct tape. Better to rip that and replace it than to rip your gloves and repair them."

That being said, just wait until your stock pivot cups die. No need to buy new cups and/or bushings with a new setup. Ride what you have first and get a feel for it. Switching right away won't help you find something you like - you'll just have a different starting point to explore your options. Don't just buy them because people say they're better.

They are extremely tight fits; good, in the sense that they have zero slop, though they do make your trucks seem to run harder as a result. They're also kinda squeaky, though it's nothing that can't be fixed with some soap or graphite. Unlike other pivot manufacturers, Riot also provides a solid duro selection. 95a is the middle ground; 90a-92.5a is for those who like a smoother, albeit less responsive truck; 100a, for those who like responsiveness over smoothness. I believe  he also makes 87.5a and lower, though they tend to be overkill. They're precision CNC'd for each truck model, even if the trucks aren't CNC'd themselves. I've run them in CRonins (100a), Aeras (95a), and Rogues (95a). Best pivot cups out there."

longboarding,3dco9a,meowfuryz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:18:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know much in terms of longboarding stuff but I can say for sure most of the discounts on cameras are absolute shit. Some beginner SLR's from Canon or Nikon that are only 10-20% off where it's more cost effective to just get the older model anyways. In terms of action cameras (Gopros, Contour, etc) the discounts are horrid so far. They're selling a bunch of Gopro HERO 4 bundles at less than 10% off, ones where you could just get the accessories bundled with it aftermarket from other sources way cheaper and just as good. Surprisingly, their most popular one (the Black) is still the same price (~$160 CAD), one which I personally expected a sizeable discount on.      I did notice a decent discount though on the Opteka 6.5mm F/3.5. If you're relatively new to shooting with cameras that can interchange lenses (ILC's), it's a wide fisheye lens that in this case mounts on Nikon cameras. I believe it mounts to FX (full frame) camera's just fine without vignetting and obviously DX ones as well, although if you're mounting it on DX it's going to be equivalent to something like 10mm. Basically, it's the exact same lens as the Samyang equivalent, full manual (so no autofocus), performs pretty well for the price (sharp through most of the frame, not too much corner falloff, etc), and is a pretty good buy for the price. They have some sample images, out of them I suppose this one is a pretty good example of its potential use.     Good luck with that!"

longboarding,3dco9a,ausername1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:26:03 2015 UTC,I'm new to longboarding and I was trying to practice carving to slow me down when going downhill... it didn't seem to work though and I kept having to foot brake/ditch my board because I was gaining too much speed. Do beginners usually have trouble with this or am I doing something wrong?  The board I have is a used S9 Lookout 2 with the stock wheels -74mm 78a Nineballs.  Edit: Thanks guys (and gals) but let me clarify- I know I will continue to pick up speed anyway but carving doesn't seem to do anything to slow me down vs. not carving. Is that normal with a beginner and will I see and feel a noticeable difference as I get better or might I be doing something wrong?
longboarding,3dco9a,TheSupaBloopa,2,Wed Jul 15 20:46:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm, try making your carves sharper. It's hard to give you tips without actually seeing your form. Hopefully this helps!"
longboarding,3dco9a,LandFox,3,Wed Jul 15 20:04:47 2015 UTC,"...well it did help but I guess I did it too sharply and ended up sliding for a split second. I was not expecting that and didn't handle it well, haha!  But I'll keep practicing, thanks for the tip!"
longboarding,3dco9a,LandFox,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:25:58 2015 UTC,"Well hey maybe you'll learn to standup too. But yeah, just keep your weight evenly on both feet and make long, slow arcs across the hill. Basically so you're pointing to the side of the road each time. When I was learning I never really liked doing that because you will continue to pick up speed no matter what. If it's a steep enough hill, carving won't do you much good since turning that aggressively at higher speeds is unstable. If you've got really steep hill you want to traverse, sliding would help more."

longboarding,3dco9a,iLikeWindows,3,Wed Jul 15 22:00:40 2015 UTC,"You are still going down hill so you will continue to pick up speed but at a slower rate. Like /u/meowfurzy said the only really way to slide down is with speed checks and slides. Foot breaking doesn't do to much at higher speeds, I recommend getting some gloves, helmet, and knee pads then start working on your slides if you want to continue to go faster."
longboarding,3dco9a,PeteTsar,5,Wed Jul 15 21:23:50 2015 UTC,carving will help slow you down but that doesnt mean you wont pick up any speed. If you want to start going downhill you should learn to slide

I bought a battle axe last summer with everything stock except some Paris v2's. I'm not new to riding at all, I ride almost everyday. I just don't know what's good for certain set ups. I looking to get into sliding and downhill type stuff and want to put together a setup that is overall good for everything. I was thinking a landyachtz loco 35 with zealous bearings,and  Paris v2's volante checker wheels. Would that be decent? I'm pretty dead set on the deck but anything else is open for change. If anyone could help I'd be greatly appreciated!"
longboarding,3dco9a,Jacob_Dovahkiin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:24:18 2015 UTC,"I love my Loco 35 but it would be really difficult to dh on. It's short and narrow. Also, Paris v2s would be much too wide for that deck. I'd go with Indy 169s and wheels around 60mm or smaller."
longboarding,3dco9a,loertsy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:41:37 2015 UTC,A better deck for all around riding would be a single kick deck with a good amount of concave. Nelson makes a lot of good ones and so does earthwing.

longboarding,3dco9a,fluentinmetaphor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:31:26 2015 UTC,"Ehhh I think it depends on the person and how often you change your stance. So I went from a tesseract DK to the darkside. At first I started standing on the tail and it was perfect, but I felt like I wasn't using the micro drops to their fullest so I altered my stance and after a week of tweaking my stance it felt normal and SUPER comfy. When I freeride I like to stand on top or like the inner half of the bubble drop because its like a MASSIVE w concave you can use it for toe sides and heel side slides. When I DH'ed on it I normally rode with in the bubble drops so I could have more leverage on the trucks. Then often times while cruising I stood within the drops and on the tail. You quickly adjust I think, I never felt cramped personally. I would keep this board, but I need to sale it because I really can't take two boards to China and I would rather help some else out then let it sit at my parents house while I am gone for like a year :\  Edit: Just in case you're curious I am 5'10'', wear size 10 vans."

longboarding,3dco9a,Kuryaka,2,Wed Jul 15 19:08:26 2015 UTC,"I started with heelside, as most others do I think. The most important things I think are speed and commitment. The rest comes with practice. Take a big setup carve, going just a little bit faster than what makes you feel comfortable, and lean. You'll probably fall a couple times, but that helps you get a feel for the weight distribution. It's largely a feeling that can't be explained, you sort of have to find your own line between slip and grip. Practice makes perfect."

At first I thought it was my wheels that they were getting to small so I put my Morgan's on same problem. So then I thought maybe it's my weight distribution so I put a little more weight on my back at least I thought I did still did a 180.   So I'm not sure what my problem is I was wondering maybe /r/longboarding would know.

Am I distributing my weight wrong?
longboarding,3d8b1x,gabriel11798,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:06:56 2015 UTC,"It's natural to gravitate towards a full rotation when holding out your slides, just try going faster (to get them longer) and stretching your back arm behind you (to check it)"
longboarding,3d8b1x,Bubbles_Tea,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:52:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip! When I do checks and long slides I always tend to stretch my back arm behind, maybe stretching it more behind would be easier to control the slide angle at a lower degree?"
longboarding,3d8b1x,ausername1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:09:46 2015 UTC,Is it kosher to use different wheels for the same longboard? I got a used S9 Lookout (green) and I really like the wheels it came with for carving. I also want to slide a lot and I think S9 butterballs seem like good sliding wheels. Can I just change the wheels for the style I feel like skating that session? Is there a reason I shouldn't?  Edit: I also have different bushings I can change; I have soft cones for carving and I bought some harder barrels for sliding.
longboarding,3d8b1x,meowfuryz,2,Wed Jul 15 03:42:13 2015 UTC,Yeah dude. That's the way to do it. I don't change anything except my wheels when I skate whether it's DH/freeride/ cruising

longboarding,3d8b1x,rubiksklube,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:55:26 2015 UTC,"I'm just giving you a hard time.   It's not uncommon to have a certain type of wheel for your board. For instance, you would probably only put big, square-lipped wheels on your DH setup, or the same wheels on a cruising board.  Freeride wheels are usually centerset and round-lipped.  You wouldn't go putting sideset wheels on a DH setup, nor huge grippy wheels on a freeride setup.  Then again, some of us use the same board for freeride and technical downhill."

longboarding,3d8b1x,MBDf_Doc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:48:50 2015 UTC,So I've been skateboarding on and off since I was kid and recently decided I'd like to buy a new board. I'm looking to get a longboard this time but not exactly sure what I should pick up.  I'll be using it to ride to and from work. So it's really just for cruising. Any suggestions would be truly appreciated!
longboarding,3d8b1x,DeadProle,2,Wed Jul 15 00:54:35 2015 UTC,Minimum or maximum length? Preference on truck mounting?

longboarding,3d6fh8,astroben11,7,Mon Jul 13 22:00:15 2015 UTC,I'm on the fence. What sets the dinghy apart from other boards its size? How heavy is it? (As in can you do tricks with it?) and is the price worth it when you can just buy a deck from fun box similar to it and slap trucks and wheels to it and be almost the same.
longboarding,3d6fh8,imironmantoo,5,Tue Jul 14 00:13:33 2015 UTC,"The funbox deck will be cheaper, and hold up pretty much as well. Funbox trucks and wheels won't be as good though.  Since it's essentially the size of a street deck with bigger wheels and a very minor nose, you should be able to do tricks with it."
longboarding,3d6fh8,Kuryaka,3,Tue Jul 14 00:58:40 2015 UTC,http://www.funboxdist.com/store/cruisers-and-street-boards/
longboarding,3d6fh8,rebrya,4,Tue Jul 14 04:26:16 2015 UTC,"Its noticeably heavier than a street deck and the wheels are also heavier, that said, with the kicktail in back its really easy do ollies and probs kickflips (im garbage though so idk about the kickflips.) And the quaility of the board i can already tell is top tier, and will last for a long time, also all Landyachtz boards are built by people who ride them everyday so they build with quality. Even if your going with a custom ride the cost difference isn't that bad."
longboarding,3d6fh8,Fugim,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:30:01 2015 UTC,The dinghy is great because its like a single kick skateboard and only a tad bit heavier. Although it has the concave and flares of a longboard so it can actually lock you in for speed and being comfortable at the same time. I also find the better concave to help with freestyle as well. The board holds up very well now too. I redrilled mine for when I want to take paths that have speed on my commute and this baby is amazing.

longboarding,3d6fh8,MyKungFuIsCat,3,Tue Jul 14 12:53:43 2015 UTC,"When looking at the specs of the board it might seem small, however it seems much larger in person.

longboarding,3d6fh8,apstra,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:33:46 2015 UTC,"Right, makes sense, specially from what apstra said, the size is perfect, it's just that I've had some bad experiences with penny boards (22""), but it was a penny so...I should have expected it to go bad."
longboarding,3d6fh8,MyKungFuIsCat,2,Tue Jul 14 15:26:29 2015 UTC,The penny is really only comfortable if you've got your stance down. But then again. If you ride penny at our size: nickel for life.

I was actually looking for a small board so was mixed between the tugboat and the dinghy, I like the tugboat, but sometimes I think if I should've bought the dinghy...And now it's weird since they have very small difference in sizes, so for the time being I'll stick with it :)."
longboarding,3d3p01,TheBatman69,2,Mon Jul 13 13:25:09 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how I was feeling for awhile after I got my tugboat... I love it now tho, such a fun board to ride!  Also this is the 1st time I've seen someone with the same board on here, so that's neat."
longboarding,3d3p01,TheBatman69,2,Mon Jul 13 16:12:18 2015 UTC,"You mean the same board as in the tugboat or the graphic? It seems that most people here have big boards that I have no interest in, I just want something to commute with and maybe go long distance and portable, so I prefer to stay under 30"".  Have you got a dinghy? Or are you still thinking about getting a smaller board?"
longboarding,3d3p01,TheBatman69,2,Mon Jul 13 16:17:46 2015 UTC,"I have the exact same tugboat haha  I know what you mean I loved how easy it is to ride/carry around campus, but I've actually decided to start looking at getting a bigger board.   I've wanted to learn to freeride on something a little bigger so I've been thinking about getting either the hatchet or the tomahawk by landyachtz.  You got any other boards right now?"
longboarding,3d3p01,TheBatman69,2,Mon Jul 13 16:24:35 2015 UTC,"Only a normal street skate board for learning tricks, but I haven't done much with it since I got my tugboat :D, it's much more fun when you can actually skate TO the park rather than ONLY at the park.  Out of curiosity, why do you want to get a bigger board? What are the big differences between smaller and bigger boards apart from being easier to push and more stable (I think...)?"
longboarding,3d3p01,wysmyster,2,Mon Jul 13 16:51:47 2015 UTC,"Haha totally, the tugboat feels like a best of both worlds.  And I want one to ride downhill a little more as well as sliding with a bit longer board. It just looks fun and different from what I've rode in the past."
longboarding,3d3p01,jvw2941,2,Mon Jul 13 17:59:44 2015 UTC,"Cool, let me know how you find it, I don't think I'll ever buy a big board, but at least I'll know what I'm missing :D"

longboarding,3d4051,_Neil_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:55:14 2015 UTC,Lasts like 4 times longer than both viscous and rvdx
longboarding,3d4051,PeteTsar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:12:11 2015 UTC,Stickers. Everyone elses grip seems to get dull spots but Gangster keeps it's pimp hand strong.
longboarding,3d4051,Earlyyyyyyyy,2,Tue Jul 14 06:37:31 2015 UTC,"Ive ridden with blood orange, vicious, and currently im using gangster. Well, BO isnt that good compared to the others. Vicious doesnt last long, the tiny crystals eventually come off the paper(?). But, vicious brand new was the best for me. Gangster, i could tell they would last long by how the crystals are laid out. A hard flick on the griptape with something solid doesnt easily remove the grip unlike vicious. U could tell vicious crystals easily come off because when you install new grip and rub the rail to cut it, lots of black crystals come off."
longboarding,3d4051,AjTheKnight,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:49:43 2015 UTC,The other 2 are fine too. I say it's preference plus gangster grip is too dank to pass up man.

It was relaxing and fun until the bump at the bottom of the small hill turned out to be sand. I bailed, rolled, and only scraped up my elbow a bit. Got back on the board and pushed back to the campsite. Wear pads.   All in all, not bad for the first outing anywhere not on my street."
longboarding,3d4051,billyrocketsauce,2,Tue Jul 14 04:51:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't drop all the way in your setup, leave a little more room to go down as you throw your shoulders like the other guy said. IME, it's not about kicking at all, instead the idea is to rotate from the top down.  Go faster, rotate your shoulders, make the whole thing 1 fluid motion."
longboarding,3d4051,ODIN598,3,Tue Jul 14 04:45:08 2015 UTC,"In my experience, what really initiated the slide for me was  twisting my shoulders. The lower body follows the upper body, I never really focus on kicking out when I coleman, but just to say, I am still pretty new to colemans."

A couple other commonly used materials are maple and baltic birch.   As for the woodworking process you'll have to set up a press. Mine is a very simple press that works for single kicks. I use clamps to apply pressure to the wood and leave it in for about a day so the glue can dry, varying depending on temperature and stuff. For glue I use Titebond-3 I think. There are other presses such as the vacuum bag press, which I'm sure you can guess how it works. The vacuum bag presses are easier to customize because they often use hard foam to shape the board which can be cut to more intricate shapes.  As for weight, I'm 175lbs and my 38"" 4 ply (1/2 inch thick) deck with a fair amount of concave is very rigid and doesn't flex at all. I also have a 4 ply deck that is fairly flexy because it's concave isn't as intense and it's slightly longer. A 30"" 1/2 inch thick deck with a decent amount of concave should be able to handle your weight provided it has decent concave.  I'm not a professional boardbuilder or anything, but I enjoy doing it every once in a while and it's a good feeling to ride something you've made with your own hands. I hope this helps and if you've got any questions just pm me or reply and I'm happy to help if I can."

longboarding,3d4051,Purgatorrry,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:29:59 2015 UTC,So I'm thinking of buying one as a first skateboard just to ride around. I snowboard and recently tried a Penny Board and a Longboard. Both were a lot of fun and I got the hang of it pretty quickly. I want something small and portable so I'm leaning towards the Penny Board. I'd just like some other opinions.
longboarding,3d4051,TheFunkyChickn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:12:42 2015 UTC,"I'll second the recommendation for the Earthwing Team 33. Great features, relatively cheap and exponentially more versatile than a penny.  The Bustin Modela is another solid option."
longboarding,3d4051,vinnimunro,2,Mon Jul 13 23:56:11 2015 UTC,"Earthwing Mini Muirderer/Team 33. Super versatile board, and great design and quality. It may be a bit more pricey than a penny or pintail but it will set you up for almost anything."
longboarding,3d4051,Kuryaka,4,Mon Jul 13 22:47:06 2015 UTC,"Gonna do a top level reply to ""why not Penny?""   Biggest reasons (AKA my reasons): Board's tiny. Can't turn as hard on tiny board, can't be as stable on tiny board, hills are sketchy. Penny is expensive.  Other reasons people will claim: Plastic is too flexy, plastic has bad grip, Penny is bad quality. WOOD IS GOOD.  Rebuttals to secondary reasons: Penny has decent plastic and good quality construction, longboarders of all people should know that there's a difference between decent plastic and super cheap knockoff plastic. And material doesn't really matter on a board that's Penny-size. It could be fiberglass-coated foam for all I care, it'd work essentially the same.  Of course, there are cheaper options that perform similarly to the Penny. /u/ThatOneNerdyGuy found that Target was selling Kryptonics Torpedo for $30, check that out maybe. Big 5 also has penny-shape boards for $30, and perpetually has 10% off coupons. These might not be as good quality, but you probably won't be hitting speeds high enough to be able to tell the difference. And even then, getting some other wheels for $40-50 will be the major upgrade and still save you money over the Penny."

longboarding,3d4051,ThatOneNerdyGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:48:20 2015 UTC,I say say the kryptonics torpedo deck is on par with the penny. Penny had better bushings and wheels though
longboarding,3d4051,PeteTsar,2,Tue Jul 14 00:22:13 2015 UTC,You forgot the crucial: Penny trucks are the most poorly casted thing I've seen a brand name attached to.

longboarding,3d4051,fiegdaddy,5,Tue Jul 14 00:42:49 2015 UTC,The popular choice here is the Landyatchz dingy. About the same price as a penny but much higher quality and versatility.

longboarding,3d4051,ellessdeeplz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:06:28 2015 UTC,Well you should get whatever you want and never let anyone tell you not to do/get what you really want.   But since you've asked :)  Imo penny boards cater to a novelty market of people who like the idea of owing a skateboard more than the idea of actually riding it and developing skills.  So if you were someone who needs a cool hip fashion accessory I would tell you to pick anyboard that is prettiest or coolest and knock yourself out. Since this person wont ride it as much as they'll carry it around it really wont matter.  If you are half way in the fashion accessory camp but also see a practical need for basic transportation and think that you might be willing to develop basic skateboard skills and manuevers a penny is simply a poor choice for a board in terms of quality of components and quality of design as far as a foot platform goes.   The complete dhingy boards from landyatchs are probably the best way to go if you like the stying of a penny but are interested in quality components and a more comfortable board design that will still be ultra portable.  I dont own a dingy but I have a small but similar gravity deck that is almost identical. Mine is made with fiber glass and offers a bit of flex. Its from the early 2000's and that was kind of the cool thing back then. Now a days peeps are leaning towards stiffer decks. Its really up to you tho.
longboarding,3d4051,Purgatorrry,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:42:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the honest answer. I wanted to get into skateboarding since forever and now it seems most convenient and it's just before being too late to get into it (not that it's ever really too late but If you want to do something like that you should get into it at least a bit before 20 and I'm 19 now). To be honest, Pennys look really cool and I like how colorful they are. I also don't want to have to carry around a longboard, even though I find riding it most enjoyable. Now I will mostly be riding it just for fun from time to time and for short commutes and won't even come close to pushing it to it's limits since, where I live now, there are no hills at all, except the Alps. I don't plan on being a hard core longborder, but I also don't want to be the poser with a Penny. The reason why I decided to get something like it in the first place is because riding it was so much fun. So once again, I shouldn't get a Penny? I'll go to the shop tomorrow and hope to not dissapoint you guys and be a fuck boy."
longboarding,3d4051,ellessdeeplz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:47:50 2015 UTC,Dude im 26. You're plenty young. If flat ground is what you're dealing with get something bigger than a penny. Any small cruiser would do. Talk to the guys at the shop. If they suggest a penny I would bail on that shop with haste. The penny is just a shitty board. If you're hell bent on it at least do yourself a solid and get the nickel. Its a little bit bigger and a little less wothless. Either way have fun.

But I say the drop throughs are easier to push compared to top mount (not really noticeable difference tho). Also any board would be fun to carve if you losen up your trucks a bit or change it the stock bushing to cone bushing.   If you like a double drop (which is a drop-through with a drop which would be really easy to push) that has a double kick like hatchet, Id say get the churchill ltd. Heres their website.

longboarding,3d4051,macneilgeorge,2,Tue Jul 14 00:39:34 2015 UTC,"if you put what is now your front foot in switch closer to your trucks it will force them to act as a pivot point, if you have a kick tail you can cheat and do a fakie nose pivot and then start dragging the wheels and then work your way toward getting it down"

longboarding,3d4051,itslowee,5,Wed Jul 15 00:23:24 2015 UTC,Don't crank down that kingpin nut. I made that mistake. You've probably killed your bushings now so I would recommend buying bushings that suit your weight. If you want you can tell me your weight I can give suggestions.
longboarding,3d4051,Ironfudge,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:55:37 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, how tight should you usually make your kingpin nut?"
longboarding,3d4051,failtolaunch28,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:50:39 2015 UTC,I usually aim for when it's level with the end of the kingpin
longboarding,3d4051,QuitoPR,3,Mon Jul 13 21:53:30 2015 UTC,"Enough to where you can't spin the washer or bushing with your fingers but not so much that you see the bushing physically bulge. If it's bulging, then it's activated which should only happen when you're riding it."
longboarding,3d4051,billyrocketsauce,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:02:09 2015 UTC,"I noticed the other day that doing this will leave the roadside washer to rattle when you stand on the board. As you add your weight, the boardside bushing compresses and opens up space on the roadside bushing, making it loose.  TL;DR: tighten until the roadside washer doesn't spin, then go about one turn further."
longboarding,3d4051,QuitoPR,2,Tue Jul 14 04:19:33 2015 UTC,Yeah it's been a while since I've done this myself. I've been running sleeved washers for a while now and they behave a little different. My method with them is to turn the nut down until I see it activated then loosen it until it feels good under my feet (or butt).
longboarding,3d4051,quantum_dick,7,Tue Jul 14 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"Don't do that, buy bushings meant for your weight."
longboarding,3d4051,TungstenTurtle,3,Tue Jul 14 05:54:35 2015 UTC,"Okay guys, so after last night's session, I'm pretty annoyed with my flashbacks. I've worn them about 3mm on the outside and 5mm on the inside. I've been riding them exclusively for the past week after on-and-off riding them before.  I keep on hearing a whirring type noise while I am rolling, and initially thought it might be my zealous, but after changing my wheels I'm positive it has nothing to do with my bearings and has to be the flashies.   The flashbacks (81a) are also slow as hell and so far aren't really thaning. Even some 20+ mph pendies made them thane about as much as my hoots at much lower speeds.  Do I just need to break them in more or is this just how classic thane is?"
longboarding,3d4051,The-Shaman,2,Tue Jul 14 06:00:35 2015 UTC,"Flashbacks have shitty-sounding cores. It's not a defect or anything, but there's nothing you can do about it other than ride different wheels. And Classic thane is notorious for having a pretty shit roll speed. As far as thane goes, just wear them another couple of mm and go faster."
longboarding,3d4051,TungstenTurtle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:52:47 2015 UTC,"Alright, I guess I'll stick with them and try to get my standies a little faster. If they're still shitty 5mm from now I'll just swap 'em out."
longboarding,3d4051,meowfuryz,2,Mon Jul 13 21:45:53 2015 UTC,"You might have either Flatspotted or oval ed your wheels. Flashes feel best going a tad bit faster because the develop a lip that you need a bit more speed for so they don't grip up on ya. Classic thane is usually pretty slow, but that means you just gotta skate faster or go longer in between your slides. As for for the thane classic thane usually shits it out, so idk."
longboarding,3d4051,TungstenTurtle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:19:36 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure haven't flatspotted them. It sounds way different than my hoots did when the chunking led them to flatspotting. I'll definitely try to take them faster and see if that helps at all and just swap wheels if they still suck a week from now.
longboarding,3d4051,meowfuryz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:22:12 2015 UTC,They ovaled?
longboarding,3d4051,TungstenTurtle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:57:38 2015 UTC,"I'll check them more closely when I get back home, but last I checked they were perfectly round.

longboarding,3d2q99,DrPineappleButts,2,Mon Jul 13 05:57:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's the longest road I've skated. It went for roughly 5 more minutes once the construction moved.   Legs weren't too bad since we weren't tucking that much, being first run and all.  I'm not the best at accurately guessing my speed, but it felt like mid to high 40's in the faster sections with a loose tuck??  No bails except Patrick at the very beginning and my sloppy shutdown at the end.  There's race potential in a lot of places, but I'd rather this kind of spot be kept relatively low-key."

I'm very new to all this, but absolutely loving it.  I've done a lot of reading on decks, wheels, and trucks, but there is so much info and combinations out there, I get lost in it.  I have an arbor oso cruiser, and also plan to get a downhill board in the future. Thanks   Edit: looking for something under 30 length"
longboarding,3d09jv,Kuryaka,2,Mon Jul 13 04:15:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need anything smaller than the Oso for cruising. A few inches isn't going to make it much more portable, until you go to Penny size. Even then, wheels and trucks make up a good portion of the board's weight.  Carving is easier on boards that you can fit most of your foot on, and the Oso is the perfect choice IMO.   If you're thinking of getting a new board, look at a downhill setup. You can slap some rougher griptape on it, and the more intense concave will help you feel more locked in. Use softer bushings for carving around and sliding at slower speeds, and swap to a stiffer more restrictive set if you're going to go bomb hills."

Carve toeside.  Fall backward. Bruh you have safety gear it's k.   Of course, knowing the technique and where to ""fall"" is implied. You want to sort of fold your legs while leaning back and twisting, all in one motion. Your legs probably won't like being folded unless you move your body out of the way too. While you're doing that, your back hand will naturally be out there to stop your fall (open up palms so fingers don't get wrecked) and you'll want your front hand grabbing rail in case you fall off. Adjust balance accordingly, depending on if you fall backward or forward."

This sub is great and I can't wait to be a part of this community. I've read a lot of the subs Beginner info and the Muirskate.com guides but I still have a question. How does length affect the ride? Bigger boards just seem heavier and bulkier. I'm going to college soon and was looking for a small board to get me around campus and not be to bulky to carry to class. I was interested in the below 30"" sizes but my friend is insisting I get at least 40"". The width I have no clue either, 8"" sounded good to me though. I have some background experience with skateboarding so I'm not a total greenie. The guides also say that newbies should get bigger boards? What sizes do you guys use/recommend?  Edit. Thanks everyone. What I've learned is that 40"" is not necessary unless I'll be bombing or dancing. I think I'll go for one right above 30"". Thanks for helping me out."
longboarding,3d09jv,ThatOneNerdyGuy,2,Mon Jul 13 03:16:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go above 40"" unless you're planning to dance or freestyle.  Sub 30""isn't munch fun. 30""-35"" is fun.

longboarding,3d09jv,ThatOneNerdyGuy,2,Mon Jul 13 07:05:55 2015 UTC,"Kicks aren't necessary for all forms of skating. Double kicks and single kicks would be more useful for tricks, commuting and Technical slidng since youll often need the kicktail. Some downhill ( dh) decks are single kicks though. Tails are also used in old shool dancing decks, cruisers or freeride decks. No tails are mainly used for freeride and dh as the need of a kicktail or tail is slim to none."
longboarding,3d09jv,Kuryaka,2,Mon Jul 13 07:33:27 2015 UTC,"I suggest around 30"" as a good size. College life is not high school life. Bags are smaller, people don't care as much about stuff, and if you've got a board you either stick it under your chair or at the side of the room and it'll be fine.   A board around 30"" is like a skateboard without the front kick. Nice comfy size for getting around and popping some tricks, but not what I'd call a ""comfortable"" cruiser. Better than a Penny, not as good as a slightly bigger and wider board.  A wider deck will be more comfortable and give you more grip (on the deck) and leverage (on the board). A longer wheelbase will be more stable at high speeds, and better accommodate reverse kingpin (RKP) trucks, which have a more linear turn (less twitchiness) compared to TKP skateboard-style trucks. Overall, RKPs are better for going quick down hills.  Longer board means that you can stand comfortably with your feet still between the wheels/trucks. Beyond that point it's just extra length. 36"" should be good even if you're taller."
longboarding,3d09jv,ReverseTheKirs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:20:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks. All the guides don't take in account my college life. I'll get a 30"". I just have to get comfortable with it before move in day. XD"

Otherwise, campus travel will get you used to it quickly."
longboarding,3d09jv,Panday_Taba,3,Mon Jul 13 16:05:56 2015 UTC,"Short board if you just plan on cruising and stance is not the issue. I would only get a deck 40 in deck if I wanna do dancing and if i have huge stance. About width, dont worry too much about it."
longboarding,3d09jv,slendys_nipples,2,Mon Jul 13 04:00:18 2015 UTC,"Well length of a deck usually corresponds with the wheelbase, aka the distance between the trucks. A long wheelbase will be more stable to ride on, but less responsive. A short wheelbase is less stable but more responsive and poppy. So it depends what you want. Width doesn't really affect how the board rides as far as I know."
longboarding,3d09jv,meowfuryz,2,Mon Jul 13 03:35:23 2015 UTC,"If you have skateboarded then you are experienced enough that you can get whatever size you want. Length doesn't really do much other than give you more room to put your feet. Wheelbase is what impacts your turning radius. The smaller it is the tighter your turning radius, but you sacrifice stability at speed. The longer the more stable it is at speed but you sacrifice turning radius. So it's really up to you and what you want."

longboarding,3d09jv,poisonedslo,2,Mon Jul 13 06:54:29 2015 UTC,"Bearings are the same, wheels are usually bigger and softer, but they fit on skateboard trucks. Trucks are usually RKP, which is quite different, but many people ride indys on their longboards.  For cruising you could just put some risers and bigger wheels on your skateboard and you're ready to go."
longboarding,3d09jv,Panday_Taba,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:05:25 2015 UTC,"Normally on my other trucks, I would use 85/82 combination (bear).

Should I be upgrading on harder bushing or should I just tighten down the nut a bit."
longboarding,3d09jv,QuitoPR,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:49:00 2015 UTC,"If you ride that soft normally then the stock Ronin bushings (92a) should be plenty hard for you. The reason it feels like it turns so much is because the Ronins are raked and with tall bushings it can make deeper turns than what you're probably used to.   If you can still turn the bushing or washer with your hands then it might need a few more turns. Otherwise, they are plenty stable."

I wouldn't tighten it down, if it's too loose then go with harder bushings. However, cronins stiffen up a bit once you gain speed so I'd say skate the stock bushings before you make any decisions.

longboarding,3d09jv,jse674,4,Mon Jul 13 01:40:11 2015 UTC,"Hi guys, I am new to this and am getting my first longboard. I have narrowed it down between two longboards. One is a pintail, and one is a kicktail. I am not sure which one to get. I mostly want to just cruise around, and maybe learn to do a few tricks. I know that a pintail is better for cruising, but a kicktail is better for some tricks. Is a kicktail as good at cruising as a pintail? Also, which board would be easier to turn/carve? Thank You!

I've tried everyone but daddies, and they all have fucking kickass customer service and a lot of variety. I've heard good things about daddies as well. You're money is much more well spent at any of these stores than Zumiez. Also, pintails don't do much more than cruise. This sub doesn't appreciate them. I like the surfy-look about them, but that's about it. For cruising, a drop-platform, drop-through, or double-drop (like the already mentioned Churchill LTD) are wayyy better for cruising imo."
longboarding,3d09jv,ThatOneNerdyGuy,6,Mon Jul 13 03:53:16 2015 UTC,"Damn it I wrote a long ass explanation then pressed cancel instead of send. I'll just summerize it for you.  Pintails are very basic, limiting and arent very good at anything.  Kicktail deck with be more verstile and make tricks easier.  Z flex isn't that great of a brand. You can do better, you are worth more than z flex.  Zummiez is frowned upon. They don't support the scene and give bad info to sell their products. They're more of a last resort or great deal type of buying.  Like others have said legits ltd freeride set up would be great."
longboarding,3d09jv,billyrocketsauce,4,Mon Jul 13 01:24:24 2015 UTC,"Man, any board can cruise. In fact, pintails suck for cruising compared to something with a dropped platform and drop-through mounting like a Churchill LTD.  I second /u/Study_of_Wumbology_; the freeride LTD from Legit is going to be loads more fun than a pintail for anything you want to do. I want one myself, really."
longboarding,3d09jv,Study_of_Wumbology_,5,Mon Jul 13 00:42:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, for a bit more background, the other guy said to avoid zumiez like the plague. They're not so bad, but they generally don't know what they're talking about and it's better to support a shop that supports the community.  That said, if you're going to be using this board for a while and want to progress over time, I would avoid the two boards you listed there. Instead, I would spring for this:   http://legitboardshop.com/shop/churchill/churchill-ltd-complete-longboard/  This is a solid setup that will work for basically whatever you want to use it for. Get the freeride version, and you get some of the best cast (mass produced) trucks on the market, good, slideable wheels, if thats what you're into, and a really nice starter deck. For $25 more than what you were looking at, it's miles better.  Edit: Forgot to mention, the setup is sold by Legit Board Shop, which is a small (online only I believe?) shop, whose owner(s?) are very active on this sub. They sponsor a few riders as well, if you notice their ""Legit Board Shop Team"" flairs, and really support the community."

longboarding,3d09jv,_milky_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:02:44 2015 UTC,"It's a defect that happens occasionally with some wheels which causes parts of the wheel to wear slower than normal.

longboarding,3d09jv,longboarddan,-1,Mon Jul 13 00:35:56 2015 UTC,"People only started coplaining about swirling a year or 2 ago, its kind of a BS reason to replace the wheel. If you rotate and ride them properly you will work through the swirled parts of the wheel and it will be fine. Companies cant be giving away free shit especially when most wheel brands dont specify a warranty policy. If they replace them, you got a set of wheels for free. If not, eh, just ride them it'll work out."
longboarding,3d09jv,_milky_,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:32:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with you to an extent, sometimes it's possible to ride out a swirl but oftentimes its swirled all the way to the core. I do understand companies can't be handing out freebies, and I wasn't trying to sound entitled to a free set of wheels. I was mostly just voicing frustration with the lack of response from Divine, especially when the first response they sent me said that they would be happy to send me new ones."
longboarding,3d09jv,WADES1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:41:40 2015 UTC,Although I agree with you for the most part it's whack of the company to be selling a faulty product.

longboarding,3d09jv,longboarddan,3,Sun Jul 12 21:21:45 2015 UTC,"Ive Raced a few events, nothing big like an IDF World Cup but ive competed in the IGSA Noram circuit and a few minor races in my area. This year Ill be at Munsville Gravity Fest, Burke Freeride, Soldiers of Downhill, King of the mountain and Race for pictonia if everything works out  For downhill there is sort of 2 different types of races, one being Outlaws the other Sanctioned events.  Outlaws are generally events that are not sanctioned with the town or county they are being hosted in and are run by skaters in the area. With outlaws you have to realize that the road will not be closed and cops are likely to get called. Keep an eye out on your local longboard facebook pages and online forums for these, normally there a $10 entry fee or so and the winner walks away with most of the cash.  Sanctioned races are races that are organized with the town or county there being hosted in and are awesome because they will have a closed road, hay bails, medical staff and normally a killer party if its a multi day event. Sanctioned races generally require one to register before hand to help cover the costs of permits and hey, this can be any where from $100 all the way up to $220 for the likes of an IDF world cup. Many sanctioned events have requirements for safety equipment like leathers and a certified full face. Id recommend you look up the course online to see if you can find any videos so you can gauge if the course is within your skill level.  For your first race Id recomend starting with a local outlaw or a local sanctioned event as they tend to be the cheapest and most open to beginners, aside from that IDF qualifying events like ACME DH are good starting races to but cost more because of the IDF affiliation."

Been wanting to learn how to Longboard for years now but money and nervousness has lead to me not trying. But my sister wants to also learn, so I have a couple questions.   I'm 6'4 320~ pounds pretty big guy and I have no clue what kind of board I'd need or anything I'd need to start out with. Or if I could even because of my weight.   Now my sister is like 5'6 120 pounds and I don't know her style but she just wants to learn and I was going to buy her a board since I never really get her anything lol. Any help would be awesome :)   We live in Canada if that helps with shops or sites to buy from. Thanks guys."
longboarding,3d09jv,SlayerSkates,3,Sun Jul 12 20:44:08 2015 UTC,"For you i'd say get an Omen Barbarian as you can use it for pushing, and you're pretty fucking tall so it'll still be good if you feel like learning to freeride. It'll be great for downhill too if you're into that. I'd get your sister a pantheon trip if she just wants to cruise around, but if she wants to do freeride and downhill maybe an omen barfight would suit her needs? For trucks I'd say Paris v2s for her, but maybe calibers for you because being that you're a heavier guy you could probably bend the paris' easily and Calibers have a wayyyy thicker hanger. Wheels are just depending on what you'll be doing. Good Canadian shops include : Royal Boardshop, Switchbacks, and Longboard Labs. Oh and zealous bearings. Don't forget to get a helmet at the minimum, gloves if you'll be doing downhill or freeride, and bushings (the rubber things that restrain the turn of your trucks) for your weight. I'm not sure what someone of your, hm, stature would use though. Definitely near 100a. If you have any questions feel free to ask."

Especially like Dimmu it might not sound like it but black/death metal is very technical to play especially at speed. Its not easy constantly blasting 100+bpm using double kicks on top of all the other drums. Black metal can get really technical but some of it is lost in production.

Once you break them in a bit though, they tend to be on the slidier side. Cubes are a lot more consistent all the way through their life. At the beginning, they're very grippy and will hold a line through whatever you put them through. The drift will be consistent on most pavements when the skin is fresh as well. While the skin on a Cannibal might last a bit longer than the Cube, the Cubes are much more consistent when they break in (in my experience). They grip very well, while having a very controllable drift.   We actually don't core them just for shits and giggles either. We do it because they're perfectly good to ride all the way to the core.  To answer the original question, no, they are not the same formula as the Cane. The Cubes will shed significantly more speed in a drift, and grip much more. They were designed for racing."

I have been casually skate boarding for a while now, no fancy tricks or anything, just cruising around the neighborhood and I've  been snowboarding for a while as well. I'm weird as hell and I skate right foot forward cause I feel really weird with having my left foot on the board at all times instead of my right yet I snowboard left foot forward because I feel like I have much better control carving and sliding with my right foot doing all the hard work.   Now for my question, would it be easier to learn to ride left foot forward on my new long board so that when I get good enough to start attempting slides that my right foot is able to initiate it as if it was a snow board (I am fully aware that it's not the same but it's the same general concept) or would I be better off just trying to make my left foot better at controlling the board while right is forward and maybe practice snowboarding right foot forward this next season just to start on that path?"

What wheel would you suggest that can roll for a long time without pushing? I also want around 80a duro so it's a smooth ride. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Happy longboarding.

Now when I bring my pushing foot onto the board I do kinda wobble a bit because I'm gaining my balance, then I slow down pretty quickly. Any ideas I can get to be more efficient? Also yes I am on a flat feshly paved road.  Thanks in advance!"
longboarding,3cwvc3,Kuryaka,2,Sun Jul 12 06:12:22 2015 UTC,"It's all about getting used to balance. Then you can push much harder and use your entire body to give more momentum.

I live in Utah at the moment so I get to snowboard when snow shows up. Balance is super similar, but if you ride back mountain stuff (basically all I did with my friends when I moved to Utah) it can be pretty different. You'll adjust SUPER fast, I went from longboarding ( with skateboarding/surf/wakeboarding in my past) to snowboarding and never had a problem"

longboarding,3cwvc3,QuitoPR,2,Sun Jul 12 14:29:21 2015 UTC,Jati decks construction is rock solid. They do 7-9 plies of maple with usually a layer of fiberglass underneath each outermost plies. Some even have carbon reinforcements near the truck mounts and the FU has an entire carbon sheet on the bottom. Even the most expensive deck (FU) is cheaper than most Rayne decks at $165. Probably the best durability to cost ratio of primarily maple decks out there.
longboarding,3cwvc3,anewsubject,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:10:10 2015 UTC,"The reason I am willing to pay the extra $50 for Rayne construction is because its light, I never get wheel bite with it, and if I curb it, it won't splinter like wood will.

When i ordered my new setup (Arbor Backlash 37) i wanted to get new wheels aswell. I enjoy arbor as a company and decided to get some Arbor Moshes. They roll nicely and drift out on turns.

longboarding,3cwvc3,TheSupaBloopa,2,Sun Jul 12 02:55:23 2015 UTC,What do you mean they drift out on turns? Are you losing traction without meaning to? They're small freeride wheels so if you're learning slides and what not they should be fine.

longboarding,3cwvc3,TheSupaBloopa,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:24:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah it'd be a bad idea to take them around turns at speed as you can tell. They're not designed to grip. A good amount comes from technique though, I'm kinda surprised you lost traction so easily.   What is your kind of riding? Are you still learning slide?

longboarding,3cwvc3,ThatOneNerdyGuy,2,Sun Jul 12 03:16:13 2015 UTC,"Cosmonaut is a dk made of maple and bamboo. It's simple and a bit lighter than some 40""decks due to the bamboo. It'd be nice for freeride but probably better for freestyle and dancing. Street tricks would be pretty difficult if you aren't derpydan or kawika  Keystone is a sk with drops and a whole bunch of different materials. It's more durable, much lighter than your average 39"" deck and a more complex mold. It'd be great for freeride and dh. Freestyle would be doable but dancing wouldn't seen like much fun.Its light weight makes street trick not as challenging as it would be on another 39"" sk"
longboarding,3cwvc3,Kuryaka,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:29:08 2015 UTC,"The (marginal IMO) advantages of the fancier construction would be a lighter deck and more durable nose-tail. It'll be able to survive crashes more easily and with fewer scratches. Weight isn't a huge issue since trucks and wheels also weigh a good amount, but a lighter deck will indeed feel better than a heavier deck when you're carrying it around."

longboarding,3cwvc3,Kuryaka,4,Sat Jul 11 21:10:06 2015 UTC,"Z-Flex is an okay brand for a cruiser - I've ridden some that my friends got. With modern construction and decent quality control, they're better than Walmart longboards at least.  Apparently Z-Flex trucks are poor quality. The pintail shape is okay for cruising, but you don't have a kicktail and can't make use of the back as effectively as with other shapes. Size-wise, it's a pretty good length though.  But when it's only $30-ish extra to get something that's better in every way, you should go for that instead.  Either the 42-inch Churchill LTD (Freeride setup) or 38-inch Churchill Kray (downhill setup) would suit your purposes just as well. These are even lower for easy pushing, and come with high-quality parts."

I would remove a couple a couple steps and spin the board faster to make it look more smooth, spinning the board is about the wrists trying to over power the board makes it look janky so keep that in mind."
longboarding,3ctcm8,L3zer,3,Fri Jul 10 20:16:28 2015 UTC,"It's beautiful, never tried anything like this but do you get this initial lift of the board by just stomping the tail?"
longboarding,3ctcm8,canarduck,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:11:23 2015 UTC,Yessir just a quick stomp on the tail while you slide your foot towards your inside foot. It gives it lift and will rotate it to the side you are initiating the trick from.

How I did it was I got down low on my board, grabbed the side and leaned back while the board was turning as far as it could, and the board slid.  This was after a 3 hour ride, and I didn't notice until the second or 3rd time out of 4 or 5 slides.  I've been boarding for almost 5 years, but this is new to me.  Edit: Spelling"

longboarding,3ct6p9,MrCaptainCody,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:46:38 2015 UTC,Hey all. I just started longboarding about 8 months ago around my campus. I have indy trucks on a 44 inch cruiser board that has risers and 80mm wheels with bone red bearings. I can ride relatively well. Two problems I have though. I can't foot brake without losing my balance on my board and I get terrible board wobble if I go anywhere above 15-20 mph. Heck today I bombed a hill in my friends neighborhood. I probably hit upwards of 20-25mph. Board started wobbling horribly and when I went to turn on a curve I lost control and got thrown onto the pavement. I'm bruised and scraped to hell but just more pissed about how bad my board wobbles. Are the trucks possibly too loose? Trucks feel fine and I like them the way they are as long as I'm below 15 mph. Also any advice on how to brake better? Braking is currently my main deterrent for riding on campus during the day for fear of hitting somebody.
longboarding,3ct6p9,meowfuryz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:19:49 2015 UTC,Footbreak at slower speeds and slide at higher. Also a stiff board and RKPS would help. But in the meantime keep most of your weight on your front foot. Do most of your steering from there as well. If you try to muscle your way around a corner with your back foot there is a chance you will wob out.
longboarding,3ct6p9,ThatOneNerdyGuy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:29:58 2015 UTC,Are you sure you're really going that fast. We often think we go faster than we really are. Even pimped out and dialed in indys wont really handle that speed that well once you hit the 20s. Rkp trucks would be best for speed.  Do you have bushings for your weight? If not do that.  Place more weight in the front that increases stability.  Learn to foot break before going fast. Don't go faster than you can foot break. Learn to slide before going down hills you can't handle.
longboarding,3ct6p9,Goldsound,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:01:48 2015 UTC,"I could've sworn I hit 80kph the other day, checked the GPS app and it was just 50kph."

longboarding,3ct6p9,Kuryaka,2,Sat Jul 11 05:17:07 2015 UTC,"Might be loose bushings. Putting more weight on your front truck (and front leg) will help you stay more stable as well.   Indys and other TKP trucks aren't really meant to hit very high speeds because they're twitchier, but you should be able to take it up to 20-25 sketchily."

longboarding,3ct6p9,Dievergenzy,8,Sat Jul 11 03:08:10 2015 UTC,So my local Longboarding group is banning the sales of used equipment/longboards on their Facebook page because they wana have the local shop get all of the sales... To me that just makes the shop look bad and just completely ridiculous.. Any thoughts?
longboarding,3ct6p9,JackOuttaBox,6,Fri Jul 10 22:17:42 2015 UTC,Thats stupid. As a shop you should get customers because you are cool not because you force smth.
longboarding,3ct6p9,legitboardshop,3,Fri Jul 10 20:45:32 2015 UTC,"My local shop XBS does a monthly swap meet. Where they invite people to come to the shop and do trades and sales in the shop. It's smart because it brings people into the store. There is clearly a demand for it. It stops people from getting ripped off, and makes it very hassle free. The shop benefits because you just got a used set of trucks, used set of wheels, you need bearings and grip tape. Boom! That's $20-30 sale that wouldn't have happened otherwise.   I can see the longboard group's reasoning for banning BST sales as well. Local shops BARELY scrape by.... Unless you're a shop trying to franchise or have the word Dad in your shop's name. There's a very good chance that you're barely making ends meet.   This is why I tell people to not buy from me if they have a local shop they can support. BST pages will be the death of a lot of manufacturers and retailers. I completely understand why they are there... but facts are facts."
longboarding,3ct6p9,Kuryaka,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:44:52 2015 UTC,"I think the idea of having a local shop handle buybacks/selling in a reasonable manner would make everyone happy. It's definitely additional work, but pays off because it's free advertising and you get repeat customers due to reliable service.  Without a method to reliably sell used boards though, banning BST groups is like DRM for longboards. Yes, supporting local stores is good, but you should not be forcing people into paying higher prices in order to benefit the sport.   The advantage of buying used? People rarely stick to their first setup, especially a cheap one. They're going to want something new, or something that's more in line with what they want. Now they have more money to spend on their next board, and will likely do so."

A few days ago I was riding one of Colorado's more popular spots, and I shit you not, some kids showed up in uncertified T8 half shells with Santa Cruz cruisers and said that they were going to bomb the road top to bottom, which is a 4.5 mile run with 9 hairpins, some at 45mph. Needless to say, we kicked them off, but it definitely happens. For some reason a lot of young groms seem to think that they can ride anything since they learned to coleman at 15mph."

Hopefully they're in the minority though right? That kind of thing makes it sound like there needs to be more organization but it's tough to inform people like that if they're not even part of the greater community as a whole. What they need to do in Santa Barbara is have organized closed road sessions early in the morning.

longboarding,3cpqhu,3_2_1_LIFTOFF,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:06:44 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that actually is a legitimate differentiator.  While a skateboarder can brake or slow down by putting their foot down or sliding, the board itself does not have actual brakes whereas a bike does (and riding a bike without brakes is illegal). A cyclist is also capable of slowing down their bike by putting their foot down or even sliding but a bike legally still requires a brake.   Bikes undergo a lot of regulations before they are legal to sell to the consumer to ensure their safety that boards do not including testing of their brakes and their ability to steer so there is a standard of expectations with any bike's ability to stop, slow down, change direction, etc.   See also:   United States Consumer Product Safety Commission - Bicycle Requirements  United States Electronic Code of Federal Regulations - Requirements for Bicycles - Tests and Test Procedures"

Generally tall bushings tend to run softer because there is more to compress. But also from what I've read the support pin causes them to feel even softer.

longboarding,3cpamd,Only_Socks_On,5,Fri Jul 10 04:49:35 2015 UTC,"For a beginner I wouldn't get an evo because they aren't very good for most stuff. Don't get me wrong, it's a great board for downhill, but I don't think you will reach the speeds where split angles are needed. Because if the split angles it's not very good for free ride and there are no kick tails so learning freestyle would be difficult."

Blood Orange Morgan 82a 70mm Black Wheels  My parents sent me a little package, cause that's what parents do, and they said they saw the video I posted and they got me a set. I was really excited because I loved my first set of BO and they really started my long slides. However, these wheels felt NOTHING like my first set of BO Morgans. These wheels are so inconsistent its insane. I rode them for about an hour and half today and I crashed more today than I have in like the last 2 months. They would catch and ice out randomly; like it was absolutely insane. It was super frustrating to ride these wheels.  Pros   Thane immediately out of the box and its this reddish/white color; ya know if you're into that kind of stuff Break in is super quick, like 2 coleman slides, maybe   Cons:   SUPER inconsistent. Super icy on turns/predrifts, then would be super grippy on a slide. I went for a big toeside around a corner and ate so much shit. Got rash all up my back. They ware super fast, way faster than I remember my white ones doing. After like 1 hour it looks like 2mm (or more) is gone already These wheels felt SO sluggish compared to my JK RAD, Slide Perfect wheels, and Lil Hoots.   Ware: 5/10  Consistency: 5/10  Shitting Thane: 9/10  Roll Speed: 5/10   Hook Up: 8/10 (10 being a strong snap kind of hook up, 0 being no hook up aka Peewees)  Ok time for some good news  Slide Perfect Supremacy Wheel 70mm 78a  I wanted to try a new freeride wheel and I saw these on polyboards shop and picked them up. Honestly, these things are just a pure dream to ride! If you like lil hoots, but want a wheel that you can ride faster and not be sketched out; these should be your next wheel. Right out of the package they are honestly SUPER icy but once you get past the preground skin it starts to feels super nice. They feel similar to lil hoots in the way the slide feels, you feel like you are going over the road rather than digging into it. My favorite thing about these wheels are the roll speed, they are freaking fast! They are much faster than my new BO morgans, lil hoots, or zombie hawgs! These wheels don't shed much speed, but they also don't have any problem taking corners.  Pros:   They leave some lite thane if you want to mark your progress (I am 152lb) They don't ware almost at all and when they do ware its very consistent across the wheel These wheels are SUPER forgiving, I have 90 blasted them a couple times when a car came out of no where and there are absolutely no signs of ovaling or flat spots! Roll speed, again they roll fast and it feels good! After you get past the preground skin, these wheels are super consistent in every single slide These wheels slide well at all speeds, fast or slow   Cons:   Haven't ran into any yet with these wheels!   Ware: 9.5/10  Consistency: 9/10  Shitting Thane: 4/10  Roll Speed: 7.5/10   Hook Up: 4/10 (10 being a strong snap kind of hook up, 0 being no hook up aka Peewees)  If you have any questions, just ask away!"

They have tons of rake which makes them hella fun for carving, but they won't be very stable for going faster.  If you're looking for trucks to make a slow speed carving machine, it's hard to have more fun than with a set of Revenge Alphas.  Otherwise go for some 50 degree Paris V2's.

longboarding,3cpamd,Parchedlemming,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:02:48 2015 UTC,Why does clear grip tape wear down faster than black grip tape?
longboarding,3cpamd,Kuryaka,3,Thu Jul 9 23:39:32 2015 UTC,"It all depends on how each type of grip is made.   Clear ""grip tape"" on most stock boards is spray-on grip, which wears off easily because it's not grip tape. It doesn't have the adhesive backing holding things in place and is designed for cruising rather than freeride/downhill applications where you'd want a rougher surface for more traction.  If it's clear tape vs black tape, the main thing I'd blame is again the adhesive. There are many clear adhesives and compounds that would work, but it's possible that some additives (that happen to have color) make griptape last longer.  I have clear Vicious and it's apparently finer than black Vicious. But red Vicious is (apparently) the same as clear, so I dunno if clear grip really wears down faster."
longboarding,3cpamd,ThatOneNerdyGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:01:16 2015 UTC,Generally colored or clear tape will be course or medium coarse. Black grip tends to be coarser for some reason.   I spray painted my clear vicious black. Shit's still pretty coarse

longboarding,3coiis,Kevtron,2,Thu Jul 9 23:48:44 2015 UTC,Well with 15 kg backpacks it's pretty far when you have to do it every day for 3 weeks.  So far we've been skating more than that tho. I don't think it will take us 3 full weeks. Unless something unexpected happens that is  Edit: forgot the question about the hours. We're on the road 12 + hours a day but that's included breaks.

longboarding,3cm8lf,speeddemon974,11,Thu Jul 9 19:56:47 2015 UTC,"Disregarding all the penny brand hate.  A board that has camber but not enough flex to flatten out when you stand on it feels pretty bad.  I made one once by accident, feels like your standing on top of a hill."
longboarding,3cm8lf,ThatOneNerdyGuy,6,Thu Jul 9 03:41:49 2015 UTC,"I know that feel with my dancer, being light weight sucks"
longboarding,3cm8lf,Kuryaka,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:16:17 2015 UTC,Yeah. Older cruisers do it well but I don't think plastic flexes the same way to accommodate riders of different weights.  Am just as light as ThatOneNerdyGuy so the struggle is real.
longboarding,3cm8lf,donkeybong64,8,Thu Jul 9 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"I thought the only redeeming quality of a penny was it's portable size. Not to mention that a symmetrical penny longboard might actually be cool for dancing, yet they went with the pintail shape.  At least nobody is wearing flip flops"
longboarding,3cm8lf,IncognitoD,2,Thu Jul 9 02:44:53 2015 UTC,"I agrre, i dont see this being to succesful for them.  It seems most people buy penny boards for the small size factor/style as opposed to the riding experience."

But also those boards don't seem to be flexing much at all, there might actually be potential for a dancer or freestyle board if they wise up and realize that a pintail isn't really the ideal longboard"
longboarding,3cm8lf,rainmaker2k,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:26:03 2015 UTC,I don't know. They look pretty nice and all. But they also look kind of high for cruising around. I think you'll get tired quite fast.

longboarding,3cl9oe,biscuitsandgroovy87,5,Thu Jul 9 15:09:49 2015 UTC,So in the past 3 months I have had a heart attack at the ripe ole age of 27 and it has come to my attention that I need to start being more healthy. I tried the gym but was not my thing and I got thinking about it and decided since I live in a beach town do like everyone else and skate. I have not yet committed to the idea in the sense of buying a board yet but was wondering for someone who is not looking to do tricks and so on if a long board might be better for me. What is everyone's opinion?

It took some getting used to coming from a bigger board, but once you get used to it it's fantastic.

longboarding,3cl9oe,meowfuryz,3,Thu Jul 9 09:20:56 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to explain but let me try to do my best. Let's take a 50° truck and say you  apply pressure onto your heels to turn. For that same pressure applied you will turn sharper on a higher degree angled truck. For the same pressure applied on a lower degree truck you will not turn as sharply. This makes it so that when you are traveling at high speeds you don't oversteer, and can really get into and put your weight into turns, which is why lower degrees are recommended for faster things. This also means that at cruising speeds you really have to put more effort into your turns to make the same corners."
longboarding,3cl9oe,xPierience,3,Thu Jul 9 03:16:44 2015 UTC,"you explained that very well, thank you"
longboarding,3cl9oe,ThatOneNerdyGuy,3,Thu Jul 9 04:46:30 2015 UTC,How the cholo's dance /s  Basically during the action of you turning it's how much the board tips to one side.
longboarding,3cl9oe,xPierience,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:46:50 2015 UTC,"When I posted in the DGT a while ago When I said I got cronins, comments came in saying ""prepare to lean"" and I thought that meant the amount of lean a person puts on the board to turn"
longboarding,3cl9oe,xmasterZx,2,Thu Jul 9 03:31:16 2015 UTC,They'll need less force to lean. Lower degrees (that'll lean more) require harder bushings to counter the extra downward leverage (=less force required).
longboarding,3cl9oe,xmasterZx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:43:47 2015 UTC,"Relatively to some trucks, maybe? but if you're comparing the same trucks, what I'm saying about baseplate degrees is true."
longboarding,3cl9oe,mrtoxic6003,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:52:02 2015 UTC,"Cronins have a shit fuck ton of lean. They'll dive in turn more than any other cast truck. Compare them to something like say ... paris 43; which turn, but feel a bit sluggish due to bushing compression. Cronins have tall bushings and a support pin to relieve stress on the boardside bushing. So not only are you going to get more turn due to tall bushings but you're also going to be able to run softer bushings because compression wont affect as much.   tl;dr: I own cronins, lots of turn even more lean, very stable very good"

Once you get it through security (which shouldn't be a problem, provided you don't have the trucks/wheels on), you can take it on as carry-on onto any flight. If there isn't room in the overhead bins, just tell the steward/stewardess, and they can store it in a closet near all their stuff! Then, just grab it before you get off, and voila! Edit: Also, you can take you backpack as well. The board is counted as a personal item, and the backpack is counted as a carry-on bag. While you might not necessarily need to take the trucks off, it'd probably give you much less hassle from airport security.

longboarding,3ckasl,mrtoxic6003,9,Wed Jul 8 16:01:22 2015 UTC,"The warranty is a pain in the ass. I was told by paris I qualified for the warranty, since I only do dh and freeride. My set was old and bent.   I tried twice to get the replacement set, but it was impossible. Take your pick of unanswered mail, waiting months at a time to get a reply, and being redirected to shops or distributors.   I say this cause every time people say paris bend easy someone else comes along to say they come with a lifetime warranty. Well chances are you either dont qualify, or the wait is going to be so long that its really not going to be worth it.  I ended up giving mine to a friend.  On a side note, the bushing seat is absolutely terrible"
longboarding,3ckasl,illz569,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:40:14 2015 UTC,Newbie question: what do you mean when you say the bushing seat is terrible? That the bushings don't fit or stay in place?
longboarding,3ckasl,mrtoxic6003,2,Thu Jul 9 00:27:21 2015 UTC,"The bushing seat is way open ... if you put a barrel on the boardside part of the truck you'll notice it can move around quite a bit, same goes for roadside but a bit less. No part of the truck is holding the bushing in place. This is fine for ronin since the support pin is whats keeping everything in place, or rogue since theres an insert keeping the truck from slopping side to side - but not for paris.   That openness means its going to allow for a more unrestricted turn, but because of how it's done it also means a whole lot more slop  Hope that helps"
longboarding,3ckasl,illz569,0,Thu Jul 9 08:58:48 2015 UTC,"It does, thanks!"
longboarding,3ckasl,DeadProle,2,Thu Jul 9 12:02:28 2015 UTC,"I've had v2s for about a half a year. I use them for cruising, freestyle, and freeride, and they excel in every one of these categories. They are one of the most popular cast truck brands for a reason. So far I've had no problem with bent hangers (I weigh 160lbs). They are super lively and responsive, and the stock bushings are pretty decent. They are by far my favourite truck."
longboarding,3ckasl,PeglegPablo,2,Wed Jul 8 17:11:24 2015 UTC,"I've been on and off Parises since I started longboarding 4 years ago. I learnt all the basics on Bear Grizzlies and now have Paris V2s and Cal2s on setups I ride today.   Their turn is pretty crazy for me, which is why I'm running 43s on a freestyle/dancer. This makes me think that 50s would be great for a beginner who isn't into downhill. Yes you can downhill anything, but the rake really does make a difference and I'd hate to be the rookie going down their first hill who starts to wobble on these. That same turniness makes them a really fun truck for everything else though. Especially freeride. Turny trucks are awesome for freeride.   They're also pretty light. Lighter than a Caliber, I'm pretty sure. Which is great for freestyle because I seriously don't get how Ethan Cochard can 360 fingerflip a Chubby and top plant it. I mean.. Those forearms..  I've never bent a set, but I also haven't done anything to mine that would bend them so I can't offer genuine help. A close friend did manage to receive a new set through their warranty without any headache though. A bus hit his board and he just told Paris that he'd been doing heavy freeride and they hooked him up.   Pros: Turn makes it fun and helpful for beginners, lightweight, no sloppier than any other cast truck  Cons: Turn makes it a bad choice for downhill, not bus proof"
longboarding,3ckasl,eMaddeningCrowd,2,Wed Jul 8 18:13:12 2015 UTC,"I've had them since August - this is my first longboard, so I don't have much to compare against.  I use them mostly for cruising, commuting, and I have recently gotten into pumping.  As someone that weighs under 120lbs, I found the bushings were extremely unresponsive for my typical usage.  Changing directions took a lot of work and the board felt mushy under my feet when it was level and struggled to get back to center after initiating a turn.  Switched to Orangatang Nipples (soft)  and it's made a world of difference.  Much more responsive, way more poppy for pumping.  Also seems to have done a great job at eliminating speed wobble.  Overall, they're great.  Not so great in their stock setup if you're as skinny/light as me."
longboarding,3ckasl,N3w3,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:27:33 2015 UTC,I weigh the same as you do and I've been looking into the v2's for my first set up. Would you recommend buying them and replacing the stock bushings? Was that the problem you were having with it being unresponsive? Or was it the trucks themselves that were the issue?
longboarding,3ckasl,eMaddeningCrowd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:57:37 2015 UTC,"It's my first board, so forgive the non-technical explanation.    Anyways, for learning how to long distance pump, they were pretty inadequate (the trucks themselves are less than ideal for it, but that can be worked around with some wedges).  I think the stock bushings felt mushy when I wanted to initiate a turn for pumping, and then they'd sort of hang out down there, making me waste a lot of energy trying to throw it into the other direction to keep the pump going.  For day-to-day cruising, they're pretty okay, but you'll want to have the trucks as loose as they can go.  The guys at the shop suggested switching over to barrel bushings and the Orangatangs were the softest they had.  They're probably about as soft as the Paris ones, but they pop back to center much more nicely.  It's much easier for me to throw the board into a rapid series of turns."
longboarding,3ckasl,spenceee,2,Mon Jul 20 17:11:30 2015 UTC,"I have had a pair of V2's sense I have started skating (2 years now). They are amazing. The only other trucks I can compare them to are bear grizzlies. With both of the trucks with stock bushings, the v2's have way less slop and feel more energetic. I recently got some venom bushings/pivot cups for them, and they are now fantastic. I run 90 roadside 93 boardside, with 97a pivot cups, and I weigh 190 lbs. I have never gotten any twitching or wobbles with the trucks (At least at 30 mph). For cast trucks, solid choice."
longboarding,3ckasl,PeglegPablo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:28:38 2015 UTC,Not getting wobbles is so much more about you than the truck. What else have you owned? What made those trucks inferior to Paris V2s? Are Gullwings too easily bent? Are Calibers made with looser tolerances making them sloppier? Do Parises solve these issues?
longboarding,3ckasl,spenceee,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:01:48 2015 UTC,"I can only compare them to bear grizzlies, and the parises are way nicer. I have never ridden gull wings or calibers. And by wobbles, I am just saying that they are way more stable with venom bushings then with stock bushings"

longboarding,3ckasl,PooFartSandwich,2,Wed Jul 8 19:22:42 2015 UTC,"Alright, here we go. I have had 180mm Paris V2 43 degree trucks for 1 year now. Great trucks. I do cruising, commuting and freeride on them.   These trucks are quite light,  lighter than Calibers and Cast Ronins. My 43 degree Paris are very leany and feel pretty great. The 50 degree Paris that my friend has are quite turny and also feel great. It depends quite a bit on personal preference which on you choose. The bushing seat is open and fits normal sized bushings. I like that there are many colorways,but they should have more for the 43 degree Paris. These trucks are pretty stable at least for me and feel quite lively. I am running Amish Cupped Washers and 90a Venom Barrels all around. I weigh about 130 lbs.   They are very good trucks, and I personally like them more than Calibers because they feel more lively."

longboarding,3ckasl,Tw0Sevenths,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:27:22 2015 UTC,"Started on 50 degrees top mounted, recently made the switch to 43 dropped-through. Both 180mm. I run with Venom Barrels and Riptide Pivots. Tried Riot plugs but they made things a little dead, so I leave them out.  50 degree are nice, a great amount of turn for very little input. Not a lot of lean for me (115-120lbs), and I run 81/85 barrels to get the most out of them. With the rake, they have a really smooth turn. Flip the hangers and they feel very very twitchy and very sketchy.  43 Degree are where it's at. A ton of lean and still a lot of turn. I run 85/85 barrels for slow/medium freeride. They have a very nice center but no deadzone at speed, I think harder bushings would solve that.   Overall construction feels very solid, and while i've checked to see how bent my axles were and most of them were slightly bent, it hasn't had a noticeable impact. It may honestly be made that way, I can't tell. I've got two sets that are relatively new, and one that's over a year. Can't really tell the difference besides regular wear and tear.  They're great trucks to start out on (either degree), and also allow for a lot of customization once you get into things more."

longboarding,3ckasl,ellessdeeplz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:15:48 2015 UTC,"I own a set of 180mm 50°  Ive had them about 4-6 months.  Ive ridden in the past, Randall, Atlas, Cal 2s, Surfrodz rkps, and sabre rkps.  Paris makes a solid truck. The bushing seats are open bs and are a bit restrictive rs. That works out nicely because you get lean but not wheelbite.  I have mine set up on double cones flat washers bs and cupped washers rs. 92a venom reg bs and whatever stock Randal cones are. I weigh 170lbs. So this setup is squirrely but still stable. I got the trucks for my drop through beach roller. It goes down mild hills great and pumps super well.  I would recomend these trucks to anyone looking to have fun under 15 mph. Im sure you could set them up to do more. I feel they really excel with squishy bushings on flat to mild declines. Maybe some 43° plates would change my mind."
longboarding,3ckasl,ze_OZone,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:41:15 2015 UTC,"I've had V2's for about 7 months now. I mostly use them now for freeride, although have used them for downhill. They feel snappy and have a quick response when kicking them out for standies. For downhill, I haven't had any problems with them at high speeds, but it is sometimes hard for me to judge when to initiate a slide because of their quick nature. I've learned almost all of my sliding on them, so I would recommend them to beginners looking to get more skilled and even veterans wanting a good set of cast trucks. In the classic Paris vs Caliber situation, I would go with paris. I've ridden on my friends' calibers, and they feel less responsive in freeride, but give a satisfying amount of lean in downhill."
longboarding,3ckasl,carter31119311,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"I've had a good experience with my Paris V2's since I'm so light (120 pounds...) At least I think so. I'm assuming that since I'm light the trucks don't bend as easy and I don't use the trucks for ollies, kickflips, etc. And I don't grind the trucks either haha. I've also had my trucks for about ten months I'd say... So I will divide this into pro's and con's for you guys. Please note I am kind of a kook when it comes to reviews haha.  They're definitely stable when you first get them - I kind of noticed them getting a little worst over time, but one of the people I skate with, (he makes wheels and stuff so I'm assuming he knows what he was talking about,) he told me my bushings weren't very good bushings. But he said its all preference so if I like it, I can do whatever.  As far as bending goes, they do bend fast. I am light so they're not bent like too terribly. My brother looked at my trucks and he said they were a bit bent but nothing major.   Overall great trucks in my opinion. Definitely worth the money."
longboarding,3ckasl,Deraekan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:38:20 2015 UTC,"I've ridden my brother's 50 degree V2's for about an hour total. The lean on them is great and makes them really fun for freeriding/general goofin'.  I wouldn't downhill, or even fast freeride on them, without some upgraded bushings; but for slower riding they're much more lively and enjoyable than any other truck I've ridden (Cals, Grizzlys, Atlas). I managed to pump for the first time on stock 50s which was cool. Fun/10 would recommend."

So I didn't watch it entirely since I'm at work, but to start with the positives. The camera was extremely stable when you were following which is SUPER awesome. The editing was pretty good, although when you make these videos its usually good to have the original video audio playing as well as the music, people like to hear the boards. I'm not sure why, but that's what I was taught. Some things you can improve on overall is just not falling as much. I recorded myself all the time when I went skating but never posted the videos. If I were you, I'd take the time to get a bit better, NOT SAYING YOURE BAD, honestly that sit down in the beginning was amazing.. But you slid to a stop which isn't a good idea. As long as you're having fun skating, who cares? You could ignore everything I'm saying honestly. Just go out and have fun! Who cares if you 90 blast your slides. But keep it up, you guys are good!"

If you are worried or think that your airline might be strict then just taking the deck is a good option as well since you can just lay it flat in the overhead compartment and it will take up a minimal amount of space.

So I decided that it's probably time I invest in a good cruising deck. I want a deck that has some significant flex, so I can pump around turns and really feel that surf-like quality. For reference I weigh 135 pounds. If anyone has any suggestions for decks I might consider (I want to stay under $100 and around 33-40 inches) that would be awesome."

I don't get it because the recommended complete is only $205 too. The other Rayne decks are expensive but the completes are also way more expensive.   You don't need flex for it to feel surfy.

longboarding,3ch8hq,DropDeead,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:01:34 2015 UTC,"Urgent:Which board(of 3*) fits my needs the best? Want to make it to the store today.  RIVIERA DINEH  Landyachtz  DROP CARVE 37  Bustin Maestro Mini  First off I gotta say I'm new to longboarding. A week or so back I found a 30 years old longboard that my uncle used to ride with my dad when they were teens. It was still in decent condition apart from the grit tape that had mostly peeled off and the front tail had broken off a bit. Learned pretty quickly how to push and hold my balance, take sharp turns by sliding on its side coming down from a short elevated peak(FaLoBW). Only to have it stolen by a group of savages that attacked in a group.. I loved riding it so much, gotta get a new one. I've been reading a lot about longboarding and have reviewed many options over the last few days and have narrowed my choice to 3 boards. Given it's such a major purchase I want to make sure it's the right one so I had to consult with the pros, you guys.  I'll be riding narrow side walks so the board must be on the short side for manoeuvrability and it would be easier to slide on lower speeds. The roads where I live are terrible and there aren't many places where I can do proper downhill nearby, but I'd still like to be able to do some of it. Some flex would be great to absorb rougher asphalt for more comfortable riding, though I want it to be stable enough for tricks and some downhill. It's important for me to be able to do ollies on ledges, benches and stuff. The street skate stuff, so the kick tails must be functional.   I was about to cop the RIVIERA DINEH but the tinny kicktails don't look promising. PICTURE PICTURE What do you think, would I be able to do somewhat decent ollies on it? And would the narrow width make it useless for sliding as the wheels extend further from the board? Apart from my paranoid worries, the board looks candy, so sweet. I could get it today if I hurry. The maestro mini seems perfect for street stuff but might be a bit too short, from what I've read it's rather hard so simple riding on rougher flooring might not be so fun. Might not be comfortable overall. The DROP CARVE 37 seems to be very comfortable as it's rather flexy but the bounce might interfere with tricks. Broader than the DINEH and longer then the Maestro mini so I might be able to dance on it.  Please share your thoughts, I'd greatly appropriate your help."
longboarding,3ch8hq,Kuryaka,2,Wed Jul 8 15:05:09 2015 UTC,"Maestro mini is quite small. Would not recommend.   If you want to do bigger ollies, you should go for a smaller topmount board instead of a dropthrough. This video is a decent representation of how much height you should expect to get. These boards will let you do tricks like dancing, but not really the street skate stuff because of the weight and design."
longboarding,3ch8hq,DropDeead,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:21:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for the video.It is just what I was looking for. So ollies are possible with such tinny kicktails. Might be harder and lower but possible. It's just that I'd hate to not be able to jump on ledges. It's not that I have to be able to do all the street skating stuff. Jumpin on ledges and sliiide...

longboarding,3ch8hq,rawryrawr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:41:32 2015 UTC,Which are you going to be more interest in downhill or street? Cruising or speed?  It kind of sounds like you want one board to be able to do it all. I think a single kick topmount with rocker and flushmounts would be perfect for you. For the rough rides just use some plush wheels and shock pads. I know you only asked for out of the three. Just my 2 cents.
longboarding,3ch8hq,DropDeead,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:42:38 2015 UTC,Rather cruising than speed. It has to be symmetrical. What I'm most concerned is if the RIVIERA DINEH has good enough tails to ollie on sidewalk ledges.  I already reserved it at the store to be picked up tomorrow. Of course I can change my mind. For the other two I'd have to wait at least 5 days.

longboarding,3ch8hq,Kuryaka,4,Wed Jul 8 18:34:49 2015 UTC,"Here's some reasoning behind getting a board (and something that's a little nicer):   Bikes get stolen often on college campuses. Campus is also crowded, and you won't be going very fast most of the time. Finding a bike rack, hoping that you'll still be able to find a bike rack when you come back to your dorm. All frustrating, especially on a mid-sized campus (trips shorter than a mile) where you won't be benefiting off a bike's speed that much.  There are cheap bikes, but those are ""mountain bikes"" with heavy tires and heavy frames. Not going to be going fast on them anyway, and those are around $100 at Wal-Mart. Getting a longboard for $150 is therefore a reasonable investment. It is also something that you like, so spending a little extra is okay.   If finances are an issue, you can chat about what you can do to save money. Maybe put in the legwork to figure out how you're getting to college. Or search for deals on cooking appliances/microwaves. Or plan with your future roommates to share appliances.   Most parents are pretty cool with you getting something if you can say, ""This is what I want, and I know how much this costs. I also know how much these other things cost, and I'm okay with not spending as much for those."" Financial planning.   Edit: Personally, I'd recommend a Landyachtz Tugboat or setting up a Churchill Square Tail deck with a similar cruiser setup. It's still going to be plenty big for carving, and it'll be more responsive for those hard carves. You can kind of rest it on your arm instead of having to hold it all the time, which is a bonus."

longboarding,3ch8hq,Kuryaka,2,Wed Jul 8 05:41:02 2015 UTC,"Can't tell. But most of the force is going to go on that area anyway, my soft wedges deform permanently after a few weeks of usage. The rest of the riser isn't getting much love in terms of pressure.  Unfortunately for reporting stuff's sake, I'm a small person so I don't think anything's going to break under normal use. Heck, I have trouble getting wheels to thane or even wear much.  Actually, looking at the other Khiro Hard Risers that isn't much plastic either. Dropthrough risers do the same thing all the time as well.  The only time I'd expect problems is if you're using it on a street slasher/freestyle setup and really doing a number on those parts. But even then, the force on the risers is vertical rather than shearing, and I'd expect them to hold up just as well as the others."

longboarding,3ch8hq,coldburido,2,Wed Jul 8 04:21:53 2015 UTC,"Hello /r/longboarding[1] . Here's a little history about my situation, I bought a 39' Pintail from Churchill MFG -- blank and generic everything. It got ran over. I recently switched out the deck to a Bustin NY Surf 29. It's a little strange from what people tell me - having 180mm trucks on a cruiser type board but I wanted this; I also swapped the stock bearings for some Zealous bearings. The board feels really trippy and I like the high ride. My problem is this - the board is REALLY slow and cannot stay rolling for very long. I have to pedal so hard and in the end the damn thing runs like a skateboard from Target. Needless to say, I'm not a happy camper. I've searched up this question in a couple of places on the internet, most people agree that it's a bearing problem. But I bought the Zealous bearings new so I feel like that can't be it. Do the bearings take awhile to adjust? Could this be a result of my wheels? If it's the wheels, I'm definitely looking for some recommendations about what wheels to buy. I want to make my board good again.  TL;DR - Board is slow and doesn't roll for long. My bearings are new, could the wheels be to blame?"
longboarding,3ch8hq,xPierience,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:02:45 2015 UTC,"It's most likely the wheels. A lot of people will blame bearings, but that's understandable. What wheels do you have?"
longboarding,3ch8hq,thestig7423,3,Wed Jul 8 04:55:29 2015 UTC,"Its 100% your wheels. Upgrade to some orangatang wheels that suit your fancy, all of those have an amaxing roll speed. Avoid the stimulus and the durian, all others are amazebalks"

longboarding,3ch8hq,The_Titans_Hammer,3,Wed Jul 8 04:26:26 2015 UTC,"it's more likely that it's your wheels than your bearings. As long as your bearings roll freely, they probably aren't slowing you down. What kind of wheels do you have now?"
longboarding,3ch8hq,coldburido,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:58:32 2015 UTC,"It's a generic no name brand wheel that comes with the longboards on funboxdist.com. The website says the wheels are 70mm, 80a, and square-lipped. Do you have any recommendations?"
longboarding,3ch8hq,IsaacMTSU,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:20:18 2015 UTC,70mm/80a should be decently fast

That said, this is my first time picking out trucks, and Paris is the safe choice. What else should I be looking at?

longboarding,3cd5kt,ChrisWorstMedicEver,3,Tue Jul 7 12:07:49 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're doing.   Dh runs in isolated locations,Monday-Thursday early morning or late afternoon. Typically 5 a.m.-7 a.m. and 6 p.m.-until it's too dark to be safe. Drive up the road, make sure it's safe, and wear clothing which sticks out.  Freeride, Suburban neighborhood, All week, 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Midday on the weekdays is the ideal for these kind of neighborhoods. I try to lay off the same hills on the weekends to give the neighbors peace and quiet.   Neighborhood DH--depends on the hill, don't go someplace that's sketchy or too fast through suburban streets. I'd go midday exclusively, Mon-Fri. Hit a few runs and dip out.   City--If you're just cruising and stuff, then no worries just go do it. Freeriding in a city is kinda difficult and can be risky--you can get a ticket easier, cars will probably hate you and not see you. Otherwise, it's gonna depend a lot and I tend to avoid these areas because they're not anticipating you to be skating. Some places never die down and you should just never skate them.   All in all though, sometimes you need to lay off the hills and go do something else. Various unforeseen shit can occur and it's a good idea to have a back up such as a skatepark."

You really shouldn't be skating anything where high traffic is a concern.  EDIT: I know ""Dawn Patrols"" are pretty popular but I still think they're not a good idea.

longboarding,3cd5kt,Dunbeezy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:42:01 2015 UTC,"I'd get the Spoon Nose 45 if you're dead-set on a Gravity, just because I like my front foot as close to the front bolts as possible, and the cutouts on the Hypercarve will make that next to impossible. Also what u/kuryaka said about bushings."
longboarding,3cd5kt,Kuryaka,2,Tue Jul 7 14:56:36 2015 UTC,"Optimal pumping wheelbase is around 26-32"" for distance, and even shorter for slalom. Shorter wheelbases mean less power needed per pump, and faster pumps. Easier to learn that way. It'd likely be easier on your Yeti (snoopin on yah flair) with 28"" WB rather than the Hyper Carve, which has a WB of 34"".   You'll also want wedges for the Randals. Mainly dewedging the rear truck a lot (15 degrees ish if possible) and/or wedging the front if you're feeling adventurous. I had one setup with +/- 7 degrees using Khiro soft risers and Paris trucks.  How soft of bushings do you have? Optimally you'd want a 75-80a barrel setup in front regardless of your weight, then a fairly soft (5-ish duro softer than for freeride) barrel pair in the back. You want to be able to get maximum turn, but still have enough resistance so the rebounding truck pushes you forward more.  Yer gonna be doing a lot of flailing around and standing as far forward as possible, foot over the front truck and other foot about standing-width away from it.   I get the feeling that your suggested setup might also work just because the length and flex of the deck essentially let you get near the front of the deck and pump that with the rear truck just trailing behind as support. Have not ridden a board that big before, so I dunno.  Am sleep now. Will answer questions in the morning if someone else (hi /u/PeteTsar) hasn't done it."

Freeride: Muirderer, Paris 43, 81a Swingers Pushing/whatever I feel like: Switchblade 36, Bear 852, assortment of random wheels.    I got board (pun) of those, so I switched everything up and now have:   Slow freeride/do-it-all: Muirderer, Paris 169 tkp, S9 Kienzle pro model Half-assed dh: Switchblade 36, Paris 43 top mounted, assortment of random wheels Cruising/city: Stock dinghy complete   I'm trying to figure out if I've outgrown the switchblade 36 as I'm about 6' tall, and have decided I hate bears.  I don't know if I want to keep the switchblade as a pusher and get a designated DH board with a longer foot platform, use the top mounted switchblade as a pusher and a DH board, or something else. Anyone who's gotten themselves into/out of an existential quiver quandary and can give advice would be really helpful. I think part of the reason this is a difficult decision is because I hate the idea of spending more money when the switchblade has nothing wrong with it."

longboarding,3ca1ho,TheSupaBloopa,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:30:35 2015 UTC,"Strings of asphalt are extremely expensive and have to be maintained. Any landscape needs to be cut down, cleared and leveled enough to pave, and then you have to pay a construction company to actually make the road, culverts etc. The whole road has to be designed to drain well to avoid washing the road away over time.   And all of this on a steep incline, probably near a city, on public property. Then when the hill is there, there needs to be bins, toilets, running water so people don't pass out left and right...   Obviously it's a rad idea but I think the amount of money circulating in the longboard industry isn't quite enough to make these things happen in more than a handful of places. If the government were going to dump money like that, they would probably invest in sports with more widespread appeal and acceptance."

Around 100$ for a complete and I think around 60$ for a deck. Paris or Caliber trucks are great both for around 50$. Wheels really depend on what you want to do but usually range between 40-50$.

longboarding,3c97y2,Glugnarr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:28:58 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert by any means, but I would go with no. Their boards (speaking from personal experience) are absolutely shite. The boards are super thick and usually heavy, trucks/bushings (which I know can be swapped but still) are very cheap and don't turn well at all, the bearings (once again I know can be changed) pretty much spin for no time at all, and wheels are just not good. Personally I just see it as a waste of $15-50, but once again I'm not entirely sure what the general consensus is."

longboarding,3c97y2,rawryrawr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:58:02 2015 UTC,All penny knock offs and penny's bend its called flex.

longboarding,3c97y2,ThatOneNerdyGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:36:33 2015 UTC,"Bushing are the little colored rubber like things in your trucks. Trucks are the shiny metal parts under the deck.  Your deck is pored plastic, could be that it didn't bond correctly or something making it more flexy. Also leaving it out in the sun weakens it, happened to my plastic deck. Plastic is also more flexy than wood. Was your previous deck a nickle?"

She told me she doesn't want me riding on the roads anymore or she'll take all my gear and trash it if I go out again today, because I was planning to just bandage it and continue riding. She says she wants me off the roads, she can't take it anymore and feels it is too unsafe. I realize she is just protecting me, but longboarding is my passion. How can I convince my mom to let me ride? I was planning on getting a new dh setup next pay check, new slide gloves, a tsg full faced helmet, elbow+knee pads, and crash pants. I told her I was going to ride with this new safety gear, but she still won't consider it. She says the speed and the roads are too dangerous. Only if I am closed in somewhere like a skate park would she let me ride, OR I must only ride with a friend who will spot, but that's not feasible since we travel huge distances and that's not reasonable to do.

These are the boards that I looked, do you guys think these will be good for me?  -Rayne Terror / Supreme / Rival (These are on top of my list, beacuse they are on sale in this shop and so they became affordable for me, but I'm not sure if these are good for me.)  -Earthwing Supermodel 3D DT 39 / Road Killer  -LandYachtz SWITCHBLADE  Thanks in advance!"

longboarding,3c97y2,Planting-plantains,3,Mon Jul 6 22:30:06 2015 UTC,"Those are all solid boards, any of them should work perfectly fine for what you're looking to do. I commute as often as I can and a few things I look for are: no flex, no w-concave (I don't find it comfortable for pushing), and drop through/drop down (lower to the ground, easier to push). Out of those id say the switchblade, but also on that site id recommend the Rayne piranha, and the earthwing double trouble"

I'm also 6'3"", and I ride with a ~22"" stance, whereas I know someone who's 5'2"" (from) and he skates a ~27"" stance. Most like to start wider and tighten as they progress, so I think the Amazon or Supreme would be your best bet. Are the ones at your shop prebuilts or just decks?"

longboarding,3c97y2,MentalMiilk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:25:19 2015 UTC,"In theory, the Rival would be slightly better for commuting due to the shorter wheelbase allowing for a smaller turning radius, whereas the Supreme would be better for downhill since the wheelbase is longer and therefore more stable. I'd go to your shop and stand on both, because both will be fine for both purposes, it really comes down to what you find more comfortable. If you really can't decide though, I'd say Rival personally."

longboarding,3c97y2,itslowee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:33:37 2015 UTC,I'm your weight but I had 50 cals instead of 44. I would recommend Riptide APS 90a Barrels and Magnums(Paris series bushings). That worked really well for me but with 44 cals it'll feel softer than it did for me.
longboarding,3c97y2,meowfuryz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:24:36 2015 UTC,You are going to need to use atleast a 1/4 in riser. The board doesn't have much chearance and 44s are hella low.

longboarding,3c97y2,CrisSwain,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:05:15 2015 UTC,My recommendation is to grab barrels around your weight rating (look up venom/riptide bushing weight figure to find where you lie on the scale) so get the ones that are for your weight and a set harder and softer. It'll take some hours of riding to find which one you like the best so no need to buy all 3 sets at once if money is a problem.

Either way lock nuts are the ones that will reduce confusion.)  1.5"" bolts at least, more if you are using risers. Get a skate tool for convenience, unless you already have a ratcheting wrench that fits #10, 5/16"", and 3/8"" nuts.

There is a lot of stuff so I made a nice google document so I don't have to repost things everywhere. I will be sharing the document around Facebook BSTs starting next week or so but I wanted to give you guys a head start.   Here are the highlights:   Expensive stuff ($100 +): TSG Carbon Helmet, Foam core Demonseed, Privy Talus, OG Hula v1 signed by pros Mid range ($40-100): Rayne Otherside and TSG Spine Protector $10 a set wheels, what's left: Hawgs Mini Zombies 80a & 82a, Bones 100s street wheels 53mm $1 a set of wheels, yes, a dollar: 62mm Street Hawgs, Hawgs KM FSU (zebra print!), Otang Baluts, and more! GONE   Here is the link to the document.  Here is an imgur album with just the pics so far.  PLEASE BEAR WITH ME WHILE I GET PICTURES UP FOR THE $10 AND LESS STUFF OVER THE WEEKEND  ALL PICS UP If I messed up any, let me know.  Had to take pics of everything like right now.

longboarding,3c6bfy,funkytomtom,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:03:20 2015 UTC,I've always thought tucking and rolling was pretty unsafe unless going like 15 or so.  Sliding on gloves and skin sounds safer than a fast speed tumble.  Do you find ninja rolls possible going fast?
longboarding,3c6bfy,TogetherWeStand,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:34:24 2015 UTC,"I didn't really have a choice, I hit a gravel bank that snapped my collar bone and caused me to Tumble, the tumbling basically made it so I didn't get any roadrash. Was pretty bummed because the only reason I fell was miscommunication between me and another rider and I took a bad line through some really bad chunder thinking my buddy was right beside me. Overall was very very lucky that there was nothing particularly hard in the 70m of ditch I tumbled through but being smart enough to tuck my head in definitely helped.  Sliding on your toes and hands is definitely better when your on pavement but as soon as your off the road you risk jamming something really hard."

I actually like tkp trucks better on my cruiser but I've got my only tkps that fit on a different board.

If you want lots of flex there's loaded with the tan tien and dervish sama. Flex is normally broken into 2 or more levels based on how much you weigh and it varies on the board.

longboarding,3c6146,Kuryaka,2,Sun Jul 5 22:40:34 2015 UTC,"The built-in bushing seat and lowness of the truck contribute to shaving off more mass. Precision trucks that have holes drilled out are the only things that are lighter afaik.  They do sound amazing though, which deck are you planning to put them on?"
longboarding,3c6146,TheSupaBloopa,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:44:46 2015 UTC,"According to a little weight chart someone posted they're pretty close to Forged Sabres on the cast plates (forged plates are lower and lighter but still) and that's impressive for full cast. I guess everyone else makes taller trucks for wheel clearance? Which is a shame, low trucks are amazing.   If I do end up getting some they'll go on a Never Summer Motive. Paris and 80mm wheels is stupidly tall so it'd be nice if I could make pushing easy and get the board even lighter than it already is. Smaller wheels would help too so I might throw on some 80a KRFs once I'm done with them."

longboarding,3c6146,meowfuryz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:09:55 2015 UTC,Imo they feel like a much lighter and lower paris that turns a bit less. They feel really nice and he says he's taken them up to 50. They would be pretty great as a commuter just be careful of wheelbite

I want to get light-up wheels but I don't want to end up with two sets of wheels when I buy a pre-built board.  How/where can I buy a pre-build board without the wheels without fully custom building it?
longboarding,3c6146,Kuryaka,2,Sun Jul 5 20:12:56 2015 UTC,"If you want to know what you'd need (and how the heck to install the wheels) you're better off learning how to build the board and building it. http://polyboards.com/help is a good place if you want more reading or are confused with the following explanation.    Light-up wheels generally have lower-quality urethane so you're not going to get the best results speed-wise. I will agree that they look nice at night though.   Head onto Muirskate.com and pick out a board, then look at the parts/brands on a default build if you're lazy. Buy the separate components, minus the things that you'll get separately. Get a skate tool."

I've had my Lush Legend [http://www.mrboard.se/2433-thickbox_kronan/lush-legend-longboard.jpg] [length 46.75"", width 9.625""] for a little over a year but I've always been anxious to actually go skate with it, especially alone.   There are some routes I can take alone, like to my old school, but nowhere nearby my neighborhood do I feel confident enough to ride alone. The fear of the speed, to fall and hurt myself and even lose my board or maybe even accidentally run someone over is too great for me. I feel this aching limit approaching when I reach about 15km/h I have this urge to either sit down on my board and let my body weight steer and both of my feet slow it down by pressing them against the ground.   This is obviously not healthy for my shoes, feet, or basically anything at all. It's not safe to sit down on my board, because maybe a car could be approaching and I wouldn't be able to get my feet on the board in time.   I want to push my limits and be able to go fast, and alone. Not being ashamed of my new hobby and have this fear make me stop what I actually want to do.   Any experienced longboarders with any tips on how to overcome my fear and push my limits?"
longboarding,3c6146,Kuryaka,3,Sun Jul 5 17:01:01 2015 UTC,"First off, I can run faster than 15 km/h for a mile or two, and the average person should be able to break that in a sprint as well. That's one comparison you can keep in your head if you're worried about speed.  Lack of control down hills though? I understand. Find a mild hill that you probably can't take all the way down. Start partway up, ride down, start further up the next time.   Safety gear is good. As far as slides go, the idea is ""turning hard enough that your wheels slip."" You have to be going a decent speed (25+ km/h which is still within running speed) in order to do this with most wheels, and even then kicking out the board takes a good amount of force.   Strength or weight to slide? Not really. A lighter object takes proportionally less force to move."
longboarding,3c6146,ThatOneNerdyGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:39:43 2015 UTC,"Foot breaking is very important and necessary do don't do doing that. Sitting down is called butt boarding or street lunge. If you suit in front like you're supposed to you have lots of control over the board and you're able to foot break with both feet allowing you to stop sooner.  As for sliding it'll be difficult since the lush is pretty much a dancer deck. It's possible though. Cult classics are beginner freeride wheels and easy to side. Those might help you out.  Like the other guy said, get safety gear it'll help boost your confidence. I think part of your problem is that you're over thinking it. Sometimes you have to just go for it and do it. Don't be a complete idiot either and do some extreme hill but take a little bit of a risk."

I'm not really into longboarding like downhill or doing tricks. I really enjoy cruising around and gliding through turns. This board will also be my transport to collage in a year or so.

I'm from Hungary so I have limited amounts of places to buy from. So I found this shop and they have a pretty good deal with an Earthwing Road Killer. It's a complete board which consists of the following:  -Earthwing Ultra Glide 70mm/78a Wheels  -Bear 5.01Trucks  -Bustin Abec 7 Bearings  -Enuff Allen Key 1.25"" Screw set  Its 223€. For reference only the board, the Road Killer is 115€. What do you guys think, is this a good deal and a good starter board? Thanks for your replies in advance."
longboarding,3c6146,UnicornFritters,2,Sun Jul 5 18:13:46 2015 UTC,"I think the deck price is good (albeit a bit more expensive than in the US), but adding 108 euros just for trucks and wheels is a bit of a ripoff. Trucks and wheels should be like 80 euros combined. Also, Bear trucks are not good. That being said, as a beginner they will be fine for you but if you find you really enjoy the sport you will probably go looking for a replacement for the trucks down the road.  I'd say if you're willing to pay about 50 euros more than US prices, it'll be a fine board and you'll have some fun."
longboarding,3c6146,Kuryaka,2,Sun Jul 5 19:03:34 2015 UTC,"But... Euro = Dollar basically, and trucks here are $50. Sickboards has trucks for €60 or so. And wheels won't be under €40 unless they're mids. Also include a little cost for bearings and hardware, about €10 at least."
longboarding,3c6146,UnicornFritters,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:53:57 2015 UTC,"Mm, not quite. $40 wheels plus $50 trucks is 80 euros, not 108. But yeah to some this difference may be infinitesimal. I'm not sure about how much prices are inflated in europe due to shipping costs and what not though."
longboarding,3c6146,Kuryaka,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:22:54 2015 UTC,"Welp. I suspected as much. I checked the conversion rate what felt like a few weeks ago, and didn't see the crash.   I dunno about the prices though. They still sound reasonable compared to separate prices for the same parts. I'm only using Sickboards for pricing reference, but the only wheels below 50 Euro are the ones that are sold here under $40, and only European trucks were cheaper than 60 Euro."

When I make a board, 75% of the work I put into it comes into play after I pull it out of the press.

This obviously isn't going to interest everyone, but the only reason they are offering the Template is the constant flow of emails rayne gets asking for custom boards, and their inability to fulfill the requests due to the fact they have to spend so much of their available time and space pumping out their regular lineup.

longboarding,3c1wa4,handsupdb,20,Sat Jul 4 03:40:34 2015 UTC,"Technically, yeah. But, wheel companies list the contact patch in millimeters. Like this: http://www.actionboardshop.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/760x800/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/a/r/arbor-summit-blue-longboard-wheels.png"
longboarding,3c1wa4,sirius_not_white,10,Sat Jul 4 02:42:58 2015 UTC,"Engineer to the rescue.  Its useless to try to define the actual square contact patch, it gives you no information on how the wheel will perform because its dependent on so many factors.  By knowing the width of the wheel that contacts the ground and the diameter and softness if the wheel, you can qualitatively estimate the behaviour very well in comparison to other wheels.  You're right, 50mm is the wrong unit for contact PATCH, but its the correct unit for contact PATH. Measuring the actual path would be pretty useless without rider information."

longboarding,3c1wa4,Plectophera,3,Sat Jul 4 10:29:26 2015 UTC,"Ehhhh. Then you also have to get into deformation, weight of rider, etc etc. and it'd have to be standardized and whatnot.   Contact patch might not be the most perfect term but it makes sense and is clearly different from ""width."""
longboarding,3c1wa4,bUrdeN555,2,Sat Jul 4 04:23:26 2015 UTC,everyone refers to the width of the contact patch when talking about contact patches
longboarding,3c1wa4,Marshmalllowman,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:16:45 2015 UTC,"True but the width of the contact patch would vary so 50mm is a good enough number for a wheel.   For example, a perfect circle has a point contact on a flat line, the point of the tangency is the contact patch. However a wheel on a road is not the same as an ideal circle on an ideal line.   Depending on the hardness of the wheel and the weight of the rider you can experience varying widths of contact. A heavy rider on a softer wheel will produce a significantly larger contact patch than a light rider on a harder wheel.   Thus when there is so much variance in the contact patch measurement it can be left as only a single value, with the orthogonal variable value left out."
longboarding,3c1wa4,handsupdb,6,Sat Jul 4 17:01:14 2015 UTC,"Theoretically it should provide more grip, but in reality the most it does is bend the axles of your trucks."
longboarding,3c1wa4,munchidk,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:10:10 2015 UTC,"Won't actually provide you more grip, totally depends on the wheel. The greater distribution if weight would change the deformation of the wheels and alter the effective coefficient of friction. Now introduce slip angle and you've got yourself a system that loses energy.  All these will do is help slightly with bumps/cracks, make you slower and potentially (not necessarily) less predictable in terms if grip."

It's dark and my rednecky neighbors have been drinking all day, so I'm not going to skate right now, but they literally feel like pvc. They're hard, the T tool feels like I paid a dollar for it, I could probably snap it if I were so inclined. I will report back tomorrow. The wheels feel like no skate wheels I've ever fucked with.

For my 30th birthday, my wife got me an off the shelf Sector 9 Cloud 9. I goof around on it occasionally with my kids, and the most use it really got was in an office of an old job; it was a pretty cool place with a long hallway leading to the kitchen. Anyway, I just moved from the Toronto area to Atlanta, which has quite a lot of hills. Was out cruising around with my son on his scooter the other day, and got a chance to open it up a bit; it felt pretty good. I was worried about getting my snowboard fix down here, but this was getting pretty close. So I'm looking for either modifications I can make to my stock Cloud 9, or some recommendations on a good setup for an old guy cruising some easy hills that won't break the bank.

longboarding,3c2tz7,meowfuryz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:46:50 2015 UTC,All trucks that can DH well freeride well. And any setup can cruise. My favorite cast trucks are 43 Paris and gullwing reverse. For decks pick anything you like that has concave and is speed stiff.

longboarding,3c2tz7,xXTowelieXx,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:01:02 2015 UTC,Cast ronins have been a personal favorite of mine. Sometimes too turny or leany for some but I prefer them over every other cast truck on the market.
longboarding,3c2tz7,Walshy472,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:01:53 2015 UTC,What durometer bushings do you have for yours?
longboarding,3c2tz7,xXTowelieXx,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:03:40 2015 UTC,I weigh 150 give or take a few so I go with 90a/93a Venom Christmas tree combo with cupped washers. I usually run an 85a/87a in other trucks using standard bushings.
longboarding,3c2tz7,WADES1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:11:38 2015 UTC,Very possible. With the proper bushing setup you can have an all around setup that feels good for most everything. Currently I'm using sabre forged trucks on 38* baseplates with 85/87 venom barrels. It feels very responsive when commuting and cruising but still is super stable for dh and freeride.
longboarding,3c2tz7,The-Shaman,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:02:48 2015 UTC,"Newtons. I would usually recommend Rojas but they're a tad on the heavy side and increase your ride height a bit while Newtons would be light and ride really low. For the cruising aspect, of course. But for DH and freeride I recommend Rojas all the way"
longboarding,3c2tz7,Kuryaka,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:03:13 2015 UTC,"Sure. Pretty much any truck works for DH and cruising, a DH setup will have stiffer bushings and possibly less turniness though. You might not be able to cruise on sidewalks easily with the exact same setup, but the only change you'd need would be softer bushings.  My freeride/all round setup is an Arbiter KT with 45/37 Death Reys (wedged) and 81-85a barrels (110 lbs).   I'd probably want even more restrictive bushings for a DH setup, and I would not recommend the Arbiter unless you like heavy decks with very simple concave.   Kahalani has cast trucks, and should be cheaper than American brands because they're based in Sweden. You will probably want to dewedge them though. Otherwise I'd recommend Caliber 44s if you can find them."
longboarding,3c2tz7,Syphs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:02:23 2015 UTC,Thanks. How do I devedge my trucks though?
longboarding,3c2tz7,Kuryaka,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:05:54 2015 UTC,"De-wedging is using the wedges in a way that makes the trucks' kingpins closer to vertical (lowering the degree/angle), so you turn less for the same amount of leaning. Wedging is the opposite - makes trucks more turny, raising the degree/angle.  You want a relatively lower degree rear truck for stability, so you can just put a shock pad on the front and wedge the rear. Easy way to remember this is to have the pointy end of the wedge facing forward.   Wedges can be hard risers or soft risers.

You can take the risk and buy online like I did (which turned out well for me) but you might find you don't like the concave.

PS3 had much better exclusives in my opinion (The Last of Us, God of War, Uncharted series, Metal Gear Solid 4, Killzone and Infamous to name a few).  X360 has Halo, Gears of War and Forza which are all great games. Still, I would say PS3 has a slight edge in regards to exclusives. Everything else doesn't really matter, though earlier multiplatform games tend to perform better on X360 (such as Red Dead Redemption, which is probably one of the best last gen games). Not that there's a huge difference, just minor ones (texture quality, slightly lower framerate and such)."
longboarding,3c2tz7,NettyBetty,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:34:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for your response. A lot of the games I've seen listed as exclusive to PS3 are games that I've really been wanting to play.

longboarding,3c2tz7,Kuryaka,6,Sat Jul 4 23:14:07 2015 UTC,"I also recommend upgrading your computer for gaming. If your computer's not ancient (read: has a CPU better than a 3-year old laptop) you can just pick up a graphics card for $200 or so and get great performance on all the games.   I got a $150 graphics card that was optimized for low power (Nvidia 750Ti) and it still runs pretty much any game fine at medium settings, which is console-quality or bettter."

longboarding,3c2tz7,Kuryaka,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:25:05 2015 UTC,"This is true.   Still, is a desktop computer something you might be interested in using? Windows/Linux is going to be kind of a new experience so I can see how that could be awkward, but it's pretty efficient since I'm assuming you're not really really into games.  Unless you really want the newest AAA games ASAP, PC gaming is pretty darn convenient. No extra subscription fees for online gaming, cheaper games, being able to multitask using multiple monitors...   /r/PCMasterRace might be able to help, but here's a sample build that outperforms my desktop in every aspect.   Kinda the same deal as building a longboard. It's not particularly hard, but you will have to be a little careful with CPU/motherboard seating. You can save some money with cheaper stuff, but probably $100-150 at the most. Weaker GPU can save you at least $60 depending on how low you want to go. You won't be able to fully benefit off an SSD's speed unless you're installing Windows on it, but I can putt along on a normal hard disk fine. Dropping the hard disk drive instead of the SSD means you'll be running out of space fairly quickly, but you can just grab a hard disk drive and slot it in later. The only part I'd recommend leaving out is the hard disk."

The controllers are still relevant, but I was kind of done with the games anyway. Only one I'd replay would be Ace Combat 6. I bought a controller adapter for the PC (lets you use Xbox 360 controllers with a computer) and had a gaming party with friends using desktop hooked up to the TV.   Reason I haven't gotten a new game console is a combination of price and inconvenience. I have a computer that works and can be upgraded incrementally, and since most ""good"" multiplayer games are now online/internet based unlike Mario Party, splitscreen gaming, etc. even a lot of reviewers are getting fed up with what new game consoles are doing."

These wheels don't have a good core but are really fun on a street deck when you want to slide and goof around.  I try to stay under 20 since I don't wear a helmet when cruising around and i just throw checks and 180s all the way through san marcos.  Love everything about that set up."

longboarding,3c0qgx,cisdbeast,2,Sat Jul 4 16:09:25 2015 UTC,I have a question regarding chopped boards. Can you cut them just about any way you want? Do you risk ruining the structural integrity of the board when you do so? I have a board that's just too long for me and this may be a viable option.
longboarding,3c0qgx,itsMARKbruh,2,Sat Jul 4 16:22:58 2015 UTC,If the concave runs the same the whole length of the board then I don't think it would be an issue. For the otherside there are drops in the front and back that shouldn't be removed to keep it strong.

longboarding,3byybq,ctrlaltChris,2,Sat Jul 4 03:26:03 2015 UTC,That's kind of a steal if it has minimal use to be honest. Look into the board specs like width and such and also ask him the model of trucks. Don't buy anything blindly.
longboarding,3byybq,Kuryaka,3,Sat Jul 4 03:25:28 2015 UTC,"The board looks like a generic S9 cruiser though, and the trucks look like Gullwing Chargers. Seeing as the wheels are nineballs and most knockoff trucks don't look like that, there's not too much risk in guessing besides damaged parts."

longboarding,3byybq,ThatOneCanadianDude,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:43:03 2015 UTC,"50 km/h honestly doesn't feel that fast unless your on a windy road, if it's just a straight road it is pretty manageable."
longboarding,3byybq,Kuryaka,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:07:43 2015 UTC,"If you're sensitive to altitude changes (AKA scared of falling), it's mildly distressing since you start feeling the change and watching the ground blur by.  With practice, 30 mph is on the borderline of sketchy. I haven't gotten there yet, but ~22 mph on a narrow road is pretty tricky too. 45/37 split on a topmount with a fairly general bushing setup (double barrels 78-85a spread, 110 lbs).   Having more foot room is definitely a plus. As you have experienced already, going faster means that shifting slightly already pushes you sideways a lot."

longboarding,3byybq,AxesofAnvil,5,Sat Jul 4 04:25:45 2015 UTC,30 mph is where longboarding becomes significantly more fun. It's when falling off doesn't become a good option to bail.

longboarding,3byybq,ellessdeeplz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:00:34 2015 UTC,It makes the board feel a bit more responsive. And the narrower width gives more grip because the wheels can follow a tighter line w/out breaking traction. You can get a better pump.

You can't run wheels too big as you'll probably be prone to wheel bite.  Smaller wheels accelerate more but big wheels roll for a longer time. Vented cores give big wheels more acceleration.
longboarding,3byybq,shotguneconomics,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:53:21 2015 UTC,It matters in terms of wheelbite.
longboarding,3byybq,seemefly1,2,Fri Jul 3 23:12:57 2015 UTC,smaller wheels are easier to kick out. less contact patch means longer slide (depends on thane and duro)  size of the wheel affects top speed and acceleration.   I think that covers most of it without getting into cores and different urethanes
longboarding,3byybq,krypt0n8_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:04:11 2015 UTC,"Is the churchill kray board good for crusing far off one push, and some downhill? If not, what are other good complete boards for $100+ drop through."
longboarding,3byybq,Kuryaka,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:48:15 2015 UTC,"It's... okay. I'd get the Kray deck, and then Paris trucks with some square-lipped wheels, if you wanted to do downhill on a budget. I really don't like Churchill trucks.  In terms of coasting distance, it really has to do with what surface you're riding on and how hard you push (and if your bearings are completely wrecked or not). Wheel quality at cruising speeds isn't a huge issue.   Technically, a light setup will give you better acceleration in one push, but a heavier board with bigger wheels will let you roll for longer after you hit the same speed."
longboarding,3byybq,krypt0n8_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:26:32 2015 UTC,I feel like i'd screw up building a longboard.
longboarding,3byybq,billyrocketsauce,2,Fri Jul 3 23:43:30 2015 UTC,"Physically assembling, or picking parts? Assembling a longboard is just 8 hardware bolts to get your trucks in, 8 bearings to push into the wheels, and 4 axle nuts to keep the wheels in place. It takes 3 tools and about 30min (just because attaching trucks is a PITA).  Look up ""how to assemble a skateboard."" The process is identical. Longboards are just better skateboards, after all."
longboarding,3byybq,krypt0n8_,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:23:35 2015 UTC,"What setup would you reccomend for crusing fast, and some downhill? I need it to be $150 or under. I like dropthrough boards."
longboarding,3byybq,Kuryaka,2,Fri Jul 3 23:33:33 2015 UTC,"To add, /u/ThatOneNerdyGuy's link is pretty much what I'm recommending, except with a more downhill-oriented setup. And it's $150 with no need for assembly.   Also, if you can build an Ikea cabinet, you are more than certified to build/clean a longboard in terms of assembling parts. Only parts where you could mess up is not putting the parts symmetrically or making the trucks/wheels face the wrong way."

longboarding,3byybq,Kuryaka,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:07:36 2015 UTC,"More expensive boards might have stuff you like, but you might not know either. I'd say those boards would be slightly better if you know exactly what you're getting into.  Unless you go to the $200 deck range, which is Moonshine MFG with waterproof construction and urethane rails. And even then you might not like the concave. And personally... I don't care about fancy things. I just want a deck that rides well, durability is not as much of an issue if you don't want to do tricks.  What don't you like about a drop deck (LTD vs Kray)? I quite like having a drop for downhill, especially on a deck with dropthrough mounting, so I don't accidentally hit the wheels with my foot."
longboarding,3byybq,krypt0n8_,0,Sat Jul 4 00:36:43 2015 UTC,Is the sector 9 fractal complete good?
longboarding,3byybq,Kuryaka,2,Sat Jul 4 00:53:49 2015 UTC,"Not if you want to downhill. The Kray complete beats it in every way besides decals. Okay, wheels might be similar quality. Even though the Churchill trucks are bad you can use them on other boards. The 9 inch Sidewinder trucks won't work on most boards at all because they're too wobbly without removing the middle section, TKP so you shouldn't be downhilling on them anyway (too twitchy due to innate design), too wide for a street deck, and too narrow for most bigger decks.  If you're looking for a balance of price and performance in a starter (non-specialized) setup for going fast, the Kray/LTD Downhill completes from Legit are the best. If there's any particular thing you want that neither deck provides, I'll be happy to help, but it'll likely put you more in the range of $200 for a complete unless you go for used parts."
longboarding,3byybq,ThatOneNerdyGuy,3,Sat Jul 4 01:02:48 2015 UTC,Legitboardshop had a kray and ltd freeride complete that's pretty sweet. Only issue you might have is the wheel being too slidey at high speeds. Personally I'm more of a fan of the LTD than the kray.

W holds your feet in place better and supports your arches, but it can make for an awkward feel while cruising and switching foot positions a lot."

longboarding,3byybq,The_Titans_Hammer,2,Fri Jul 3 20:37:15 2015 UTC,"I have the Hell Camino, which is the same as a Muirderer 37"". It's very light, has a ton of foot space, and the pressed down W concave and wheel well flares give you a very good idea of where your feet are without looking. The 33"" should be similar, but obviously a bit lighter and with less foot space. The kick is very functional, and the nose, while stubby, is still very usable."

longboarding,3byybq,guitarawker94,2,Fri Jul 3 21:59:39 2015 UTC,"Great concave! Classic shape. Light, but not incredibly good for flip tricks; they fuck up the rails if the board lands upside-down because the concave means pronounced rails. She's great with TKP's on the inner wheelbase, and RKP's still feel amazing for higher speeds on the outer wheelbase. I prefer TKP's because it's much easier to utilize that awesome kicktail. Overall, awesome freeride deck with longer wheelbases than you'd be able to get on a double kick of that size. Possibly my favorite deck for casual freeride. I always use it when first learning a slide, because the relatively short wheelbases make slides easier to kick out."

I keep hearing stories from friends from here in Oregon and from down in California that specific classes for transfer degrees will probably have to be retaken once you transfer to a four year school, since the community college class gives the same credits, but doesn't teach you everything you would learn from the university class. Instead, take electives that satisfy your prerequisite requirements. Get good grades in those classes, and apply to transfer to universities that accept your community college's credits. Besides, taking electives is a good way to get a feel for college. You may even find something that you find more interesting than an AoJ degree."

longboarding,3buvgb,JosietheIguana,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:22:33 2015 UTC,I'm willing to bet the board was a Landyachtz Switch. It's shitty. Board companies have moved to using smaller drops and they feel a lot more natural; less clunky and anchory.
longboarding,3buvgb,ThatOneNerdyGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:21:06 2015 UTC,"Well we can help you learn today. What you want is called a top mount. Drop thru has a hole where the trucks are mounted. Drop down has a slope between the trucks where there middle gets lower. Double drop is a mixture I'd a drop thru and a drip down. Flush mount is more rare and that's a top mounted deck but where the trucks go there's a carved out box to slightly lower the deck.  A deck won't really make you go faster, that has more to do with the wheels. How smooth a board feels mainly relies on bushings, pivot cups, wheels and shock pads.  What was your previous set up? Knowing what you had will help us set you up with what you might like."

longboarding,3buvgb,meowfuryz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:05:08 2015 UTC,"I think esserts for learning to slide is a bit overkill haha, id go for some these 317s."
longboarding,3buvgb,zeththedarkmage,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:11:38 2015 UTC,Yea I wanted to grab a set of these wheels cause them seem like good wheels and i'll have spare cash which I rarely do. I was also looking at the frf727 but they didn't seem a lot different from the kegels. The 317s look good too.
longboarding,3buvgb,TheSupaBloopa,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:16:07 2015 UTC,"They're not similar at all to Kegels. Kegels are not freeride wheels like 727s and they will be incredibly difficult to learn to slide on. It was a pain in the ass for me just breaking them in and I was sliding them at 25mph with two years of DH experience. Seriously, get some round lipped wheels for learning, Kegels are not beginner wheels in any way shape or form."
longboarding,3buvgb,zeththedarkmage,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:18:22 2015 UTC,The kegels were for long distance pushing and I figured they would be horrible for sliding which is why I wanted round lipped wheels like the esserts. The 727s didn't seem different enough to warrant purchasing them as a secondary set of wheels for sliding as they seemed more square lipped than rounded.
longboarding,3buvgb,TheSupaBloopa,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:22:35 2015 UTC,"No they're round, unless you're looking at the ones with the skull graphic. They were some of my first wheels, and while they were excellent, something like 317s would be better for learning. much easier to slide at low speed. The Kegels will be awesome for LDP but don't try to slide them. Even as DH wheels I think they're pretty shitty."
longboarding,3buvgb,zeththedarkmage,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:25:04 2015 UTC,"317s appear to be the popular choice so I will probably grab those. Thanks for all the info. Glad I wasn't crazy in thinking the kegels would not be good for sliding. I think I might have been looking at the krimes, not the 727s now that you mention the skull."
longboarding,3buvgb,TheSupaBloopa,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:39:29 2015 UTC,"It's the same 727 formula so they can be easily confused. If you even get into DH though, those are amazing wheels."

I have been thinking about this for a while now. Being the owner of Roarockit and the inventor of a popular method of building boards I would like to host a longboard building contest here on Reddit. Some questions I have for you before and if I go down this path. Is this something you would like or not? What type of build would the contest be about? Oldschool, enviromentally sustainable, experimental, downhill............. Should we limit the contest to a bulding method or keep it open? (Dimm Press, Rail Press, Roarockit TAP......) As a prize I would offer $300ish worth of either material or Roarockit tools to the winner(s). Do we divide this up so we have 1st, 2nd and 3rd prizes or do we have it as just one prize, going to the winner? What would the timeline be? What is a fair way to pick the winners? Any other questions that you think should be answered before we do this would be appreciated? To let you know I really like builders that are experimental with their builds and with the materials they use. If I had a wish for the direction of this competition I would like to see this be part of it. Thanks Ted at Roarockit"

longboarding,3buvgb,Whu_am_i,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:09:23 2015 UTC,I couldn't stand it. It came with my ps4 and I had to get rid of it. I played the other 2 games and loved it. But the new suit essentially gives you super powers with being able to slow down time and stuff which for me ruins the point of batman. Batman is badass because he hides in the dark and takes people out one by one or fights a group of guys without powers. They dropped the ball on this game.
longboarding,3buvgb,PACIFICRIM_JOBS,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:15:15 2015 UTC,What are you on about? The suit doesn't slow down time. Fear takedowns allow Batman to take multiple goons quickly which is something Batman can do at his peak.
longboarding,3buvgb,Whu_am_i,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:21:16 2015 UTC,It says the suit is essentially feeding off fear. Which makes time basically slow down so batman can take out a room full of enemies in a second. That's like giving batman super speed whenever he wants to take out a room full of guys. That's not batman. Maybe I have an old view of what batman should be since he's my favorite super hero but what they made him in that game was not batman.

Either way, DH is all about taking it one step at a time. Even if you're experienced, you always take new hills slowly and cautiously at first so you can learn when to push it.   If you can coleman, then learn to pendy those at higher and higher speeds. Same with your tuck, get that nailed down on slow runs and make sure you're comfortable and stable.

Get comfortable with it and learn to coleman if you haven't yet. Once that's done you'll definitely want to upgrade before you start going fast, mainly because that's a tiny wheelbase for DH.

You can definitely learn to slide, but you board will kick out extra fast due to the small wheelbase (how far the inner mount holes are from each other) so you'll need to learn to adjust quicker. Your board is pretty dope for cruising tho. A longer wheelbase will allow easier learning though, since it'll be a bit driftier on hookup (when the slide initiates)"
longboarding,3butpy,kirbykaz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:24:37 2015 UTC,"I think I might hold with slides and stuff and just use this board to cruise and commute for now. If I really get into it, I'll probably buy a freeride board with a dropthrough(?) and have that setup for learning how to slide and stuff, but that'll be in the future.  Also, talking about boards, how do pintails ride? They look dope and I'd love to have one."
longboarding,3butpy,kirbykaz,2,Thu Jul 2 17:29:42 2015 UTC,"Good idea. Get a feel for everything. Well, dropthroughs are more for low crusing due to their (usual) flex, but I learned slides on a drop through. Id recommend a VERY STIFF 36"" dk for freeriding. The stiffness helps a lot because your board wont change and mess you up during your concise body weight adjustment. I mean, pintails are pretty much dedicated cruisers (they do look pretty dope tho) but ive bombed a few hills and slid on my friends, wasnt bad."

I have had some great experiences on these, and I would love to share it with everyone else, and can't wait to hear other people's experiences. I've had them for about 8 months now. Really excited about them. I have the Aera K4 raw trucks, 176mm ttitanium hangers (which turn into 172mm cause of the narrow hangers) and 48/42 black baseplates. I love them to death. I ride them with my hangers flipped. They have a ton of rake so unflipped, they're very very very responsive. Flipped they're a little dead feeling, but when you start going super fast, they are lively and super stable. Couldn't be more stoked on them. They're smooth for drifting, and great for taking lines. I ride them on a Rayne Kyle Wester, with These Wheels or Rad Advantages. Also very great for freeriding too but I mainly use them for downhilling. Very predictable in the way they turn, and they have a ton of stability. No wobbles whatsoever. I wouldn't change a thing on them. Love mine to death! Feel free to ask me any questions on them."

longboarding,3bqsqv,ThatOneNerdyGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:06:49 2015 UTC,"Basically what gabe says, with the exception of the wheels. I don't know much about them, but you basically want something square lipped, 60-65mm and 78a-82a. For bushing you want cone and barrels for your weight."
longboarding,3bqsqv,gabriel11798,2,Thu Jul 2 07:17:49 2015 UTC,"Having square lips on a DK or anything slow undermines the point of them, because it's not like he's going to ice out while pushing.

longboarding,3bqsqv,ThatOneNerdyGuy,0,Thu Jul 2 07:27:45 2015 UTC,"He said he just wants to cruiseand square lipped wheels are more common for cruising, if he wants to slide than yes definitely round lipped"

longboarding,3bqsqv,meowfuryz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:10:59 2015 UTC,Wut. Have you ever iced out at pushing speeds on gripper round lipped wheels? Theoretically smaller contact patch= faster roll speed too cause less friction.

longboarding,3bqsqv,itslowee,2,Thu Jul 2 04:01:16 2015 UTC,Pretty much any board can be used to commute. For downhill and sliding get something without flex. If you're on a budget take a look at the earthwing hoopty for your deck. If money for a deck isn't an issue then there is a endless list of decks and it all comes down to preference.

longboarding,3bqsqv,ThatOneNerdyGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:28:17 2015 UTC,Check out  Legitboardshop.com and look at the ltd freeride set up. It's a great commuter. With your budget you can afford a better deck but that gives you an idea of what to look for

I'm on my phone and a really poor WiFi connection that requires me to hold my phone up and at 1am in my bed so I couldn't spend too much time comfortably. I personally would go with the topmount I put there(kick tails are fun to mess around with) or maybe a board like the landyachtz topspeed or Rayne vandal V2(probably too expensive) but that is my preference. I do recommend you go with a topmount or maybe go with the drop through then try top mounting it later.  Edit: another deck I would suggest is the landyachtz peacemaker (36"" inch one) it is a topmount board with a single kick tail. I've seen them used for freeriding and such but I'm not too sure about downhill on it."

longboarding,3bqsqv,trothe13,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:04:35 2015 UTC,I'm about 5'11-6' tall and I weigh about 175. I was just thinking about the length problem...
longboarding,3bqsqv,Kuryaka,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:24:49 2015 UTC,"You should be fine - only worry is for shorter people who would have way too much foot space and a very long board. The Gravity deck is not bad, and having a bigger platform is useful too.   A double drop deck (the one you chose) is super low to the ground so it's good for pushing. If you like it, go for it! I'd recommend Paris trucks, grabbing 70mm round-lipped wheels, and going for either just the stock Beasto bearings or getting an extra set of Zealous bearings on the side. Both are good, Zealous is arguably a bit better, but who can argue with free bearings?"
longboarding,3bqsqv,trothe13,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:35:10 2015 UTC,"Sweet. Thanks for all the help man, its been super helpful. Nothing like a great community to ease you into a sport.  My only worry about the 41"" board is that it might be too long to carry around with me on campus. I'm currently in my 3rd year of university and just starting taking public transit, and I need something for the last leg of my commute. Some days I'd have to carry it to between 3 classes."
longboarding,3bqsqv,Kuryaka,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:40:29 2015 UTC,"Seats are kind of a problem. My 36"" board is already too long to stick under desks completely. Sticks out a little. I've heard some people say that a board bigger than 34"" or so is too big for comfortable campus cruising, but it really depends on how and where you stash your board.   In smaller rooms, putting the board somewhere near the walls should be okay since you can keep track of it. In lecture halls with the folding seats, you might be able to fit your board under the seats, horizontally. It's definitely an extra thing to plan around, but not much of a hassle IMO.   How long is that last part of the commute, by the way?"
longboarding,3bqsqv,trothe13,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:14:48 2015 UTC,"Its about a 10 minute ride to the station, and another 10 minute ride to the door of my classroom.  I'd love to get a smaller board like the landyachtz dinghy for school, but I don't have the money to buy both that and a downhill board at the moment, and I'd still like the option of being able to downhill and slide with my friend."
longboarding,3bqsqv,Kuryaka,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:24:24 2015 UTC,"I actually prefer the bigger boards in most cases, even if it means having to carry it around all day. Advantages of being able to do long distances easily versus the disadvantage of slightly more difficult walking.   And I'm 5'0"" with a 9-ply tank of a board. Heh. Then again, I'm also a runner so I'm used to doing a little extra work all the time to stay active."

longboarding,3bqsqv,ThatOneNerdyGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:56:44 2015 UTC,"Kuyaka is correct, loaded has a hard time selling. From what I've seen they don't sell easily unless they're have a good amount of damage but not enough to questions it's durability and are sold at around $70.  Selling the parts individually would be more profitable. Like the trucks at $30/$35, wheels at $35/$40, deck at $100/$120 and other accessories under $5 or free when you buy 2 or more items"
longboarding,3bqsqv,Kuryaka,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:37:56 2015 UTC,"You might not be able to sell it on the BST too easily for a fair price. Loaded boards are expensive for newbies, and a lot of this community won't jump for a flexy drop deck.   If it still looks practically new and you need the money quickly, you might want to sell individual parts instead. Otherwise, it'll also take longer.   Depending on the condition... if no cosmetic damage, it's safe to assume at least 10% off stock price, shipped."

longboarding,3bqsqv,ThatOneNerdyGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:47:40 2015 UTC,I was so confused as to when sony made longboard then when Nelson came out with an action camera named after their batray deck. Drugs are weird man.  Assuming you want the batray for freeride and maybe some downhill do you have another deck that can serve those purposes? Do you already have a camera?
longboarding,3bqsqv,Goldsound,2,Thu Jul 2 02:48:14 2015 UTC,"I don't have a camera.

longboarding,3bqsqv,xPierience,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:52:00 2015 UTC,I'm extremely desperate for a batray too man.
longboarding,3bqsqv,ThatOneNerdyGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:18:47 2015 UTC,Get the camera sine it's what you need need then save up again for the batray. Having a second deck that serves the same purpose of your curvyis more of a luxury than getting a camera. Even if you'll enjoy the batray more than the Amazon.
longboarding,3bqsqv,Goldsound,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:01:23 2015 UTC,I feel as though the camera isn't something I desperately need either. I just need a friend to hold a phone for me lol.
longboarding,3bqsqv,ThatOneNerdyGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:26:44 2015 UTC,"Carrying a phone in your hand and skating around following at semi high to high speeds can be pretty risky.

longboarding,3bqsqv,Goldsound,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:43:37 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I wouldn't do that, if I'm gonna record something I just lay it against a rock and hit record.

I would rather further develop my skills at this moment."
longboarding,3bqsqv,ThatOneNerdyGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:55:45 2015 UTC,Use your other camera method and split the bill with those in your crew since they'll all use it. Also a batray wouldn't be the easiest deck to learn on. But oce you have tons of decks will be ready to ollie on.

I'm looking to have just a cruiser between classes. I got 130mm Polar Bear trucks, 1/4"" risers, and 61mm Venom Curbstompers. What would be a good deck to use with these? I don't necessarily need kicks and the bigger the wheelbase the better for stability."
longboarding,3bqsqv,sharpiefinepoint123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:09:58 2015 UTC,"if it's a cruiser between classes, you don't need to worry about stability. if anything, a wheelbase on the shorter end would be useful navigating around obstacles and people"
longboarding,3bqsqv,ccarlitos2,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:30:25 2015 UTC,Thats true. Its just the board that I have them on now is a little too unstable for my taste. I just started riding so something more stable is welcome for my noobish skill :)
longboarding,3bqsqv,sharpiefinepoint123,2,Thu Jul 2 00:59:51 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong, but I think 'balance' is the word you're looking for, which is something everyone needs to work on and is eventually not a problem anymore through time and practice  when referring to wheelbases and stability, it's related to speed. A shorter wheelbase will have a more sudden, snappy turn when going 20+ mph while a longer wheelbase will be less responsive and have a more subtle turn, therefore making it a more stable setup"

longboarding,3bmrtm,Kuryaka,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:34:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Do you have numbers on how they compare to other wheels? I'd think that the other main difference is in the cost of the equipment/designs needed to start it up.

longboarding,3bmrtm,sharpiefinepoint123,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:59:05 2015 UTC,"I think this is true. Many times when you buy something expensive, it's the name/ image you are paying for  These companies spend more money on advertising, endorsements, branding etc. so they need to sell at a higher price to make a profit, while generic products are cheaper  Of course, quality can vary or be the same from product to product, but for longboard wheels it's more subjective"
longboarding,3bmrtm,ThatOneNerdyGuy,0,Wed Jul 1 04:49:25 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it cost less. Iirc iPhones/iPods cost like $5.  Edit: $50 not $5

longboarding,3bmrtm,ThatOneNerdyGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:03:33 2015 UTC,Ment to put $50. With all the things that go into an iPod and it only cost $50 I think wheels would only cost $5 or $6
longboarding,3bmrtm,TheSupaBloopa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:27:54 2015 UTC,That's completely irrelevant since Apple/Foxconn have full control over the entire assembly process. Plus it doesn't make sense to compare mass market electronics to skate wheels. They're that cheap because they sell hundreds of millions of them.
longboarding,3bmrtm,meowfuryz,2,Wed Jul 1 07:39:15 2015 UTC,I doubt it. The cores probably aren't cheap and neither is good urethane. It would be different If it were mass produced but longboarding is a very niche market. Also that may be true for ipods but iphones are most likely very different. The chip and hardware alone probably cost more. Also you have to account for the R&D. If apple was making like a 100% profit they would have one of the best business models in the world.

longboarding,3bmrtm,fluentinmetaphor,3,Tue Jun 30 20:59:45 2015 UTC,"hey guys, i just put my zealous bearings on, and i had heard that with those you can tighten the axle nut down all the way without it affecting the spin of the bearings, but when i did that and spun my wheels, they stopped pretty quickly. is that true? if not, how tight should my axle nuts be?"
longboarding,3bmrtm,billyrocketsauce,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:00:17 2015 UTC,"I had the same thing. Ride a bit, and your bearings will settle all the way into the wheel core. Once you do that, your wheels will wiggle on the axle a little and you can crank the nuts down."

NASCAR? definite ban, MLB NHL or FIFA? probably also bans.  For this sport to ever be respected as a professional sport instead of punk kids skating down hills, there have to be rules and procedures in place beforehand for stunts like this.   As for getting decked, again, while he may deserve the karma or whatever, this sport needs to be given a professional backing. If you let the athletes knock a clock for this, it's going to keep the sport a joke. I'm bothered there aren't standard rules in place. And no other spectator watching did anything to stop this guy either, damn. Makes the entirety of this sport look like a joke, and furthers the skater kids being anarchist punks stereotype  Just a lack of respect from everyone, all around here  Edit: seriously this kid majorly goofed here. Not only did he set foot on an active track, he then put water on it, drew a freakin penis with his sweet time, then caused a crash and affected racers' times due to them having to adjust to this condition.

Danny, someday you will personally encounter someone this stupid."

Well, what if this skateboard swipe hit the kid into a coma or killed him because the kingpin nut hits his temple?   Hypotheticals should work on both ends. No one was seriously hurt to my knowledge. Ban the kid from these events and reprimand the person who assaulted him. Then establish rules for these situations at these events"
longboarding,3bj8d0,ChrisWorstMedicEver,3,Mon Jun 29 23:57:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry but fuck that. The kid deserved an ass beating and then some. Pranks shouldn't put people's lives at risk. If someone were seriously hurt, you wouldn't be saying this."
longboarding,3bj8d0,MisterMunkae,4,Tue Jun 30 00:34:09 2015 UTC,"To quote u/ChrisWorstMedicEver :   I know it sounds like I'm overreacting but shit in the middle of turns can end a Dh skaters career or season.   I know the place is hay bailed up and stuff but no, that that isn't enough, You can see in the pictures that he's already flipped before he ever even got as far as them. If it was a bad enough accident he could have broken any number of things, possibly including his neck and been paralyzed. When you're racing in triple digit heat (as I believe I read on PushCulture's Insta (or someone else's)) and the road is behaving one way, then there is suddenly a wet patch, no matter how big or small, on a TURN at high speeds? That can be dangerous and I think he's somewhat justified in giving the kid a beating (hopefully not severely) but he effectively caused the accident by slicking the track and, its not fun to fall like that tit for tat I say"
longboarding,3bj8d0,Dekkaz,12,Tue Jun 30 16:25:58 2015 UTC,"I still see no justification in hurting him. I highly doubt if he knew his actions would cause a crash that he still would've done it. I think it just comes down to not thinking at all of repercussions or realizing it was even a possibility, and that doesn't deserve a beating."
longboarding,3bj8d0,Lynx436,2,Tue Jun 30 09:49:08 2015 UTC,"I can completely see why you would disagree with a beating, but I'd like to think you can understand it.  If someone risked my life for a shitty joke while I'm doing something that's incredibly important to me I would be pretty upset in that moment.  I don't know if I'd kick anyone's ass but I'd put ""the fear of god"" in 'em.    I'd be downright furious.    Playing with lives and emotions is a good way to get people to do stupid shit."

Not the same really, but one time some friends and I parked our car on a random residential street to skate and when we got back some kid thought our open air jeep was suspicious and shot at us with a pellet gun from his backyard in the darkening hours(what the fuck was he thinking, so dangerous!!). We found where it came from and I almost attacked him with a 2x4, but instead yelled at his parents about how stupid it was. So yeah, was heated at almost losing an eye(heard shots wiz by us), but I scared the crap out of him and no one got hurt. I do think the stupidity levels are similar in these situations and most people replying to me don't realize how many stupid actions miraculously don't end in injury.  TL;DR- Don't underestimate the power of not thinking/stupidity, seriously!"

longboarding,3bj8d0,UnicornFritters,3,Tue Jun 30 17:09:02 2015 UTC,"haha It's fine. I've gone fairly fast down my local hill a few times quite recently to get to the bus stop at the bottom to go to work, definitely not break-neck speeds like these guys, but I got a bit of the ol' speed wobbles and had to stand up to use myself as an air break (luckily there is sometimes a strong headwind that just helps me to cruise down the hill and not go super fast (in my books at least)) And for the most part its a fairly straight road with a slight sweeping turn but one day as it started raining I could feel how slick it was and it was a huge confidence knock, so much so that I ended up foot breaking, walking down most of it and carried on riding from the mellower ending of the hill. Going fast is dangerous enough and you feel it, in adrenaline, but hitting a wet patch for me just takes the adrenaline away and drags me right back into full fear mode.  Just before we moved here a few weeks ago, I was skating to the store through a Sub-urban area and went past someone's house who has vocally expressed his disgust at me in the past, and on this day, must've decided to litter the road with gravel and other small sized stones, as they were pretty much littered in a line kinda like a police speed trap stinger thing across the road in a straight line from his house. Well, I hit one, hard enough to stop my front wheel and throw me off, and unfortunately (through my own fault) I wasn't wearing my gloves and I scuffed up my hand and my knee pretty badly as I landed, and I wasn't evening going that fast, i'd say mid jogging/running speed? After having a few choice words with the guy and nothing more I still wanted to knock his lights out. But I went for a different approach and got the police involved and apparently I could've sued him for Public Endangerment, but by then I had calmed down a bit, and just told the guy that I'm not a degenerate skater kid who spends his waking hours tagging walls, damaging property etc etc and that I just use my board to get to the bus stop to go to work, and that I merely use my board to commute (though I have been practicing small scale tricks and such in a nearby park, stuff like pivots etc etc.) I just asked that he apologize for causing my accident and also stereotyping me which he eventually did. He's still an ass though.  P.s. Sorry for my long-winded answer back"

What blows my mind is how this kid decides to put the water in the turn. You can go straight through shit like dirt, rocks, and water okay but the rider is anticipating a dry corner and is gripping it as hard and fast as possible. This kid is goddamn lucky Ricker high sided during a heelside turn for this. If he had hit this toeside, then Ricker could have cracked his dome pretty damn easily."

longboarding,3blrt1,fullmelt,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:52:22 2015 UTC,"I have pickles, revenges and used to own exskates and have spent time on originals.  They are all really unique in feel.  Each one has very different return to centre and resistance characteristics.  The revenges are smooth and somewhat progressive.  The exskates are similar with some more return to centre.  The originals I remember just diving wildly, and the pickles do a similar thing but with almost no RTC.  They are the most fun with some really grippy wheels and a steep road.  The game then becomes carving hard enough to keep the speed down.  These things are kinda scary at speed."
longboarding,3blrt1,thestig7423,0,Thu Jul 2 13:55:35 2015 UTC,Thats actually a really cool design. You should go into why torsion trucks like rojas and these have rake and how that effects the ride. I also want to see a video of these in action
longboarding,3blrt1,antwwon,2,Wed Jul 1 04:51:38 2015 UTC,"Actually, Rojas aren't torsion trucks at all. But the main reason why all these trucks have rake is because on a bolt pivot design, the way to make it rake-less would be to have the axle and the pivot intersect.   The only practical way to do that would be thread in axles or something. Nobody wants to do that because of how much it would increase the cost and complexity. Maybe we'll see that once somebody comes up with a design successful enough to merit a revision like that.  I'll work on a video. I have an old I think 2006 Evo I can mount them up on an I should end up with a good usable height. That is, if I dare  risk brining the evo out of the museum for a day."

All the sites I've found seem to be inactive or have ""Not Available"" next to their decks.  I do some woodburning and thought it would be cool to try burning some designs on a longboard.  First one would probably just be for me, but if I can find a market I might sell a couple.    Also, I'm still a relative newbie trying to get back into longboarding after a few years off.  Any advice on finding good places to ride?  Not looking for anyone to blow their spots, I just live in an area with a ton of traffic and I'm having a tough time finding places to practice as a newbie!"

She couldn't handle the springy-ness and looseness of the pintail, so I rode it for a sec and sweet shit, how did I ride that thing for so long?

longboarding,3bit35,Plectophera,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:12:41 2015 UTC,Rake makes your turn/lean relation non-linear
longboarding,3bit35,gabriel11798,3,Tue Jun 30 12:55:58 2015 UTC,"The axle offset from the pivot point of your truck.  Calibers are rakeless, therefore flipping them does nothing because the offset is non existent on both sides.  Paris are raked, therefore flipping them will give you negative rake because the axles are off-center with the pivot point."

longboarding,3bit35,ludafiech,2,Tue Jun 30 04:28:14 2015 UTC,Kodiaks or reverses?
longboarding,3bit35,WADES1,3,Tue Jun 30 04:11:49 2015 UTC,Honestly they aren't really comparable as they sit in two totally different price ranges. If your just looking for a solid cast truck that won't break the bank go with reverses. If your looking for something more costly and closer to precisions go with kodiaks or sabres.
longboarding,3bit35,meowfuryz,7,Tue Jun 30 04:28:16 2015 UTC,There is a 90$ difference... the real question is forged sabres or kodiaks. After that the question is rake vs no rake.
longboarding,3bit35,thestig7423,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:19:11 2015 UTC,With all the extras kodiaks have the actual trucks end up at like $70

It takes the skill of doing the trick, good balance, and proper timing  Survive  As for the board you want something at least 40"" x 9"" and personally some kicks, trucks go for paris 180mm 50°, zealous bearings, 65mm-70mm wheels, and double barrels for your weight that are on the softer side.

longboarding,3bit35,Kuryaka,2,Tue Jun 30 00:53:15 2015 UTC,"Mmm... making it the ""real thing"" will probably disappoint many people. Especially since most of the people who buy stiff boards are pretty savvy and/or don't need the composite reinforcement. If you laminate something trendier like Loaded decks, they're not going to flex as well.   Unless you have a discounted source or are adding a big premium onto the cost, shipping will probably drain most of your profit, and laminating stuff with epoxy+composite is not very cheap in itself.  I mean, if someone wants you to do it and you find a market, sure? These are probably the people who are also convinced carbon fiber/fiberglass makes you go faster and won't be persuaded otherwise."

longboarding,3bit35,Kuryaka,3,Mon Jun 29 23:05:21 2015 UTC,Muirskate carries a lot of stuff but not as many smaller-company products.   Legit has nice setups and an emphasis on American-made products.  Polyboards probably can go for the niche that Thane Store had - experimental stuff that might not really be popular without good reviews.

longboarding,3bit35,PeteTsar,8,Mon Jun 29 18:29:19 2015 UTC,"I ride mine every day around the city and it's great. You can take seemingly impossible lines through people and obstacles if your awareness and control is on fleek. It actually makes for a way smoother ride as you end up pushing less and you can swerve around rocks and the odd patch of chunder. (Maybe that's just a dumb thing we have here)  Distance pumping is bullshit on a slalom board, it's much harder to maintain momentum compared to a longer dedicated distance deck because you have to make quicker rotations and you get less power for your pump. I play a sort of game though, everytime I push I see how far I can possibly get by trying to maintain the pump, eventually I'll make a mistake and lose the rhythm or have to make a corner or dodge something and start slowing down, so then I push and try to go for distance again.  What I do is push as normal but when I'm up to speed start swinging to try and keep that going, I'll roll for anywhere between 2 and 5 times as far, occasionally accelerate beyond my max pushing speed but that starts draining energy quickly, there's a reason slalom races are normally under 30 seconds, it's a painful muscle and cardio workout, if you watch some pro races with sound you'll see the sweat dripping and hear them grunting (like Tennis) as they throw themselves into each cone.    but tl;dr you can use it for cruising, garages and grip DH as fast as you feel comfortable. You'll be suprised how stable a ~20º rear can be on a 20"" wheebase, but I doubt you'll be able to hit 3 miles without pushing, I think I can maybe get 500 yards if I don't fuck up.  Do you know what setup you would want?"
longboarding,3bit35,BreakingInReverse,2,Mon Jun 29 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking Bennet/Tracker combo with a Fullbag Seb Leger or Louis Ricard, and the cheapest wheels I can get. Probably Big Zigs. Not quite sure about the deck, and I'll have to do some research on wedging."

longboarding,3bit35,Kuryaka,2,Mon Jun 29 20:00:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely. For both. 3 miles isn't a lot, and while you might not be able to do big efficient pumps it's doable.  I'm the weird guy with wide trucks and a drop deck for LDP. Most people use long wheelbase topmount decks with narrow trucks for efficiency."

longboarding,3bit35,RollinBart,6,Mon Jun 29 18:01:14 2015 UTC,"Cleaning bearings is probably the most overrated thing in skating.  Dirt doesn't do anything if the bearings are shielded, if they spin fine,  you won't have to do anything about it. If they don't, throw some Skanunu in it and give it a spin.   The nut on the outside of the wheel will be stopped if you have speedrings, spacers, or built-in bearings. (Bearings with the spacer built in.)  Just don't tighten it too much, but make sure you eliminate any play between the bearings and the nut."

longboarding,3bit35,The_Titans_Hammer,9,Tue Jun 30 03:37:50 2015 UTC,"Don't chop a board just because you ""kinda want to."" A chopped board won't have the same durability as it did before the chop, and if you change your mind afterwords, you're boned unless you want to buy a new board. Keep using it for a while longer and really decide whether or not it's what you want. If it's not, try putting it up for a trade."
longboarding,3bit35,_Neil_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:25:54 2015 UTC,As long as you chop the board good and re seal it there is no effect on durability.
longboarding,3bit35,The_Titans_Hammer,5,Mon Jun 29 19:17:52 2015 UTC,"Emphasis on good, though. I think it's a pretty safe assumption that most skaters don't have much woodworking experience.

longboarding,3bf6vv,tiddeltiddel,2,Mon Jun 29 14:08:49 2015 UTC,I read a recommendation to screw them so that the room for the wheels is just gone. Also it doesn't really matter how long your wheels roll if you spin them with your hand.
longboarding,3bf6vv,jbub13,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:16:45 2015 UTC,"make sure you have bearing spacers, then tighten the nuts on the axles down until you meet resistance (don't crank them down after resistance is met).

I was able to slide on my friends Sector 9 side winder, which is older and worn in.  I don't have any videos of my technique but I feel like something is off..  There were marks of wheelbite too.  Muirskate included washers so I need to put those on.  Here is my build Which everyone said would be good to start learning to slide.  Any ideas?"
longboarding,3bf6vv,AxesofAnvil,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:53:56 2015 UTC,Is the shiny skin off your wheels?
longboarding,3bf6vv,The_Titans_Hammer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:16:51 2015 UTC,"For wheelbite: use cupped washers instead of flat washers if you aren't already. If you are using cupped washers, try getting bushings better suited to your weight.   for sliding: keep your lead foot at about a 45* angle on your board, and your back at 90*. When you go to slide, precarve to your toeside, then carve heelside and try to aim your chest in the direction you want to slide. Try to keep most of your weight over your front foot, that'll make it easier for your rear truck to break traction and start sliding.   I hope you have safety gear and some clothes you don't mind putting a few holes in, because you'll eat shit a few times. The secret to getting good is to mess up a lot, and learn every time you mess up. After each run, try to think about what you did well on or messed up on. If you pay attention to what you're doing, you'll learn a lot faster."
longboarding,3bf6vv,Vexxicus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:06:15 2015 UTC,"They did send cupped washers, so I'll switch those out for sure. and it seems like i need to work on technique. and i got a helmet, knee pads and gloves - definitely roughed up some clothes but nothing I can't spare.  Thanks for the advice!"
longboarding,3bf6vv,silasmatson,2,Mon Jun 29 17:08:30 2015 UTC,Glad you got it! Be sure to lean back and whip your shoulders around. Maybe get bushings for your weight too if you haven't already.

longboarding,3bf6vv,SpringheelPaul,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:03:16 2015 UTC,"as others have said, the shoulder turn is the key to get the wheels to breake loose. if you think it doesn't work try going into the precarve and as you put your glove down look behind you directly up the hill. you have to overcome the instinct that this is a bad idea and commit to it. also watch that one riptide how to video as it mentions everything you need except for the looking behind.."

longboarding,3bf6vv,jbub13,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:35:57 2015 UTC,"phenomenal slide set-up HOWEVER: if you learned how to slide on side-winders you're going to have a rough time transitioning to a standard RKP truck.  The side-winders are VERY cary due to the double bushing seat, however, start becoming unstable very quickly at even moderate speeds.  This is why people learning to slide faster opt for RKP trucks like your Calibers.  TL;DR - you're setup is on point, just gonna take time to develop proper form to slide at high speeds.  PS - remember to skate within your limits!"
longboarding,3bf6vv,Vexxicus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:17:31 2015 UTC,"I had never actually slide before yesterday, so I wouldn't say I learned how to slide on his side-winder, just that I was able to on his board but not mine, so I was confused.  Everyone said it was a good set-up but I couldn't get it actually slide.  I too have a sidewinder and I know they can get pretty unstable so not even going fast, I was able to get a slide.

longboarding,3bf6vv,jbub13,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:20:44 2015 UTC,yup - moar practices makes moar better  learn hands-down first?  some say it's easier to stand-up slide once you get the feel of breaking traction.  others say it hurts your form to learn hands-down first.  See what works for you.

longboarding,3bf6vv,jbub13,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:36:32 2015 UTC,my guess is your buddies board is a lot lower - which means your center of gravity is lower and it's easier to break traction.  On your top-mounted deck try leaning further off and away from your feet to reduce traction in your wheels.  More weight on your hand = more slidier

Tell me what you guys think i should get that would fit my needs the most. :)   https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/completes/69804/earthwing-2015-miniglider-longboard-skateboard-custom-complete#/wheel?d=69803-69969&t=205-11081&b=32931&r=1900&w=38821-53721  https://www.muirskate.com/longboard/completes/67221/sector-9-2015-chamber-longboard-skateboard-custom-complete#/wheel?d=67211-67271&t=49591&w=20271-20321&b=32931&r=14891
longboarding,3bf6vv,psych0ranger,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:13:47 2015 UTC,"I have a pool deck on those volante checkers wheels. They're turning into great freeriding wheels as I break them in. But! As a person that's really just now learning more freeriding stuff, im not using them to their potential, and still enjoy the feeling of my other, more downhilly wheels for the cruising I do.   So, In terms of how those volante wheels feel on a sidewalk, they're big enough to roll over stuff but they're hard enough that you'll really feel those bumps and cracks in your feet, even through shock pads and risers.  I just got a miniglider for my kid and put gravity burners on it, 66mm and 78a, they feel really comfy on the sidewalks and road cracks we have here."

If you want something shorter try the drop speed(I can't seem to find them for sale anymore), although it looks like the concave on that is a bit different. If you have a skate shop near you that has longboard decks go there and see what you like and ask the workers there for suggestions. Once you have your setup make sure you get really hard bushings so that turning has some resistance. I would recommend calibers or gullwing reverses for your trucks since they have beefier hangers so it won't bend as easily as Paris trucks, all three of those trucks are very good though."

Luckily it is summer so I have a bit more leeway with learning how to as there aren't many people there during the summer, but how can I not be a jackass once school starts and there are tons of people? Do I ride in the bike lanes or on the street? Would I be better off biking? I don't want to hurt anyone or myself, thank you!"
longboarding,3bf6vv,burnzkid,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:56:17 2015 UTC,"Just learn to rip well on a short wheelbase board with a kicktail. I go to App State up in Boone, where skating, especially on campus, is illegal. Just need to learn to push fast, kickturn well, maybe learn some standup checks. Just keep your trucks loose and your legs looser, and you should be able to bob and weave through even the heaviest rush hour class change foot traffic. I rode on paths, mainly because there are no roads through campus. Biking is the same thing really, just stay narrow, loose, and leany. I used to split between spaces just wide enough to fit my bars through. So long as people stay on a predictable path and don't try to get out of the way, you can spot your line through it all pretty easy."
longboarding,3bf6vv,Kuryaka,3,Mon Jun 29 15:56:42 2015 UTC,"Boards and other non-bike wheeled thingys occupy an awkward place - faster than pedestrians, slower than road bikes.   If your campus is small, biking might be more of a hassle. Going to the bike rack, unlocking, riding, finding another bike rack, locking, walking to class. However, the bike will be much more useful on hills or if you're planning to go off campus without using a bus.   At my university, it is illegal to use non-bike wheeled contraptions in bike lanes, and boards are also technically not allowed on certain paths. Everyone rides boards on the main pedestrian paths, because they're big and wide enough for 4-5 lanes of movement, no problem. Police don't watch (or really care) besides for one road near the campus center. Many people use boards since biking is more of a hassle and there aren't dedicated bike lanes where they can really hit higher speeds safely. There are many bikers because the campus is big, so there's perfectly justifiable reasons to pick any form of transportation.  tl;dr: Check your laws. Talk to people you know, check out your campus's paths to see if they're wide enough to accommodate pedestrians + faster than pedestrian things."

I was considering biking but to be honest they're a lot more money, and the people who bike up there are really intense and grumpy about it. Also the bike lanes are terrifyingly packed during school haha. I'll definitely ask around, thanks :)"
longboarding,3bf6vv,DDelRRamos,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:15:16 2015 UTC,You'll want to know how to footbrake and use your kicktail to make sharp turns. Having a small board will help.

longboarding,3bf6vv,PeglegPablo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:16:24 2015 UTC,"Longer boards are more stable at speeds. Technically it's the wheelbase that makes you more stable but they're correlated. I go to a pretty big university and the campus is swamped between classes as everyone walks, bikes or skates to and from. I got by riding a 39"" board with a ~24"" wheelbase all year and I'm pretty sure I only ran over one person's foot. Make sure you're super aware as you're skating around campus cause pedestrians can be so freakin unaware it's infuriating. They like to veer left and right unpredictably as they wak and will step backwards or make sudden sharp turns without notice so you have to be ready to respond to all of that. If you hit someone, you're gunna look like the bad guy cause you're on a skateboard even if they basically jumped into your path"

longboarding,3bf6vv,NettyBetty,2,Mon Jun 29 01:22:53 2015 UTC,"I got out and skated a bit before sundown (it's still 28 June here). Hit a couple of minor hills, including one that ate me up weeks ago, and even recorded it. It doesn't appear as though I'm going as fast as I felt--useless, uninteresting footage. Still felt amazing though; I got speed wobbles and handled them calmly.   I'm hoping to get up in the morning and hit the hills again. Maybe even work my way up to the top and practice two-handed/push up(?) slides throughout. My pushing also needs work.  I hope everyone has/had a good day!"
longboarding,3bf6vv,turnt_table,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:15:17 2015 UTC,"Hey guys!  I have been skateboarding since was very young, and I started casually longboarding for about 3 years ago to get around my town. I recently started learning how to slide and do different tricks, and I am ready for a longboard upgrade.  Currently I own a Sector 9 Mini Shaka with dano downhill 78a wheels and randal RII trucks. I'd like to buy a new one soon because my current board is slightly warped, the trucks are bent, and the bearings are worn out.  My budget on a complete board is between $200 - $250 USD.  I think I like the Sector 9 Dropper, but any input would be great!"
longboarding,3bf6vv,meowfuryz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:58:42 2015 UTC,"Pick a stiff board of your liking. Check out muirskate.com and come back to me with your favorite 5-10. For trucks if say get gullwing reverse, and these 317s for wheels."

longboarding,3bf6vv,The_Titans_Hammer,2,Mon Jun 29 01:44:51 2015 UTC,"I'd go with an Earthwing Scavenger with Indy 215's, zealous bearings and These ATF 317s. Should come out to like $210 I think. Maybe look in to some bushings. Indys can fit a regular bushing bs with no washer or a street bushing bs with a washer, and a street cone roadside. I may or may not just be suggesting a setup I want 😂"
longboarding,3bf6vv,turnt_table,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:18:21 2015 UTC,I feel like it's so tiny! I'm 6 ft 4 so I'm looking for a board around 40 inches to be able to have a wider stance
longboarding,3bf6vv,The_Titans_Hammer,2,Mon Jun 29 02:42:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm 6'5"" with size 13 shoes so I feel you on the wide stance thing. I have a few different freeride boards, most of them are Earthwings. you could go with a Hoopty 36"" if you want a top mount nk, a Hell Camino 37"" for a top mount sk, or a Hightailer 43"" for a top mount double kick. They all have a huge amount of foot space and can easily clear 65mm wheels with most trucks. Someone mentioned the DB Keystone, if you buy that, you'll consume most of your budget. It's definitely worth its price, but if you want new trucks and wheels I'd steer clear of $200 decks. Maybe a DB lunchtray 39"" instead? $140 instead of $200 but it doesn't have any kicks and opinions about its concave are pretty polarized. People either love it or hate it. Having stood on one myself, I really like it, but it comes down to personal preference. it's got really, really aggressive concave that locks you in. Great for taking high degree trucks to high speed because you don't need to lean as much to keep your feet on your deck."
longboarding,3bf6vv,turnt_table,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:11:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm yeah out of those boards you suggested, I like the Hightailer the best because of the double kick.  It sounds like a need to find a board shop around where I live so I can stand on a lot of boards and find what I like.  The Nelson Batray that /u/PeglegPablo suggested is my favorite one so far, but it is toward the pricy side."
longboarding,3bf6vv,The_Titans_Hammer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:44:58 2015 UTC,"I've got a Hightailer. All I can say is it's big. Really, really big.  Pretty light and strong in spite of its size, but its really big. I have more space than I need on it, and that's really saying something."
longboarding,3bf6vv,turnt_table,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:58:34 2015 UTC,Yeah 43 inches seems a tad large
longboarding,3bf6vv,PeglegPablo,2,Mon Jun 29 07:11:55 2015 UTC,"The DB Keystone, and Nelson Batray would be dope do-it-all boards for your price range and height"
longboarding,3bf6vv,turnt_table,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:50:55 2015 UTC,What are the positives and negatives of having the cut-out nose and tail like the dropper vs the nose and tails on the boards you just recommended?
longboarding,3bf6vv,PeglegPablo,2,Mon Jun 29 03:22:22 2015 UTC,"Cut-outs let you run bigger wheels, but there's no need to be riding wheels larger than 70mm nowadays. Except on a dedicated downhiller, so don't worry about that. Cut-outs make the kicks kinda small are harder to use too. A topmount with fat kicks will fit most wheels you'd reasonably want to run and have more functional pop"

longboarding,3bf6vv,Tripplethink,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:09:21 2015 UTC,"I always use the softest bushings i am comfortable with. It's more fun for me. On my carver i use 80a riptides for my front truck@58°. On my freeride board i use 93a/90a barrels. So i'd say get harder bushings if your board feels unstable at higher speeds or you want less turn, otherwise there is no need to switch. That being said, it's always fun to experiment with different bushing types/manufacturers/duros so if you can afford it, why not?"
longboarding,3bf6vv,PeglegPablo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:39:20 2015 UTC,"Sounds a touch too soft, It also depends on what manufacturer you're getting bushings from. Riptide? Way too soft. Venom? Little bit too soft"

When we were filming this one of Dan's co-workers was jokingly (mostly) threatening to chuck a water bottle at his head mid shot, definitely not the most serious environment hahaha. One thing I admit we totally blanked about was comparing it to other wheels that are similar, really should have done that.

It's really just personal preference. If your going to be using the kicks in switch alot go with the double kick though.

longboarding,3bc1q9,rubiksklube,3,Sun Jun 28 15:29:50 2015 UTC,"First, they perform exactly the same as any other bearing (including REDS)  Really, bearings are bearings, and the built-in nature of Zealous is a huge plus. Their nano-ceramic lube is just great, and since they are double shielded, they will be hard to get dirty. I've never really had to clean mine going on a year.

longboarding,3bc1q9,rubiksklube,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:55:54 2015 UTC,"Zealous are only slower in the break-in period. With time, the excess lube will squeeze out of the shields and they will come up to speed.  I'm not trying to get you to buy something you don't like; 90% of us use Zealous. They are pretty much the longboarding standard at this point. The only thing that could compete with them at this point is if Bones releases their built-in bearings."

longboarding,3bc1q9,SlayerSkates,5,Sun Jun 28 02:20:22 2015 UTC,toeside pre drift without a glove is called a roman candle. A none glove coleman is an indy if you grab or a sitdown is not grabbing rail.

longboarding,3bc1q9,SlayerSkates,3,Sun Jun 28 15:09:56 2015 UTC,oh yeah that's an indy then. They're all just variations on a sitdown with different rail grabs. I'd try cannonballs next :D the reason I mentioned roman candles was because you said toeside pre drift and there's no such thing as a toeside coleman. That pretty much is a toe drift. So yeah if you did a toe predrift and didn't put down your hand that's a roman candle.

longboarding,3b8rqc,ellessdeeplz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:58:30 2015 UTC,In my experience running shoes shield you from the ground with lots of cushion. They also have raised grip patterns which make contact with the grip inconsistent.   Skate shoes have flexible thin soles and insoles that alow you to feel the board better.

longboarding,3b8rqc,HunterSThompsonJr,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:28:32 2015 UTC,"Getting a job is always a good idea to ensure that you'll always have money in your pocket. If possible, make sure that it is something that you enjoy and don't mind doing. For example, you could apply at a boardshop since you like skating (I assume), video game stores if you like games, camera stores if you are into photography, etc. Plus, you have the added benefit of employee discounts (usually). You're around things you love all day and you have the ability to buy them at a discounted price--win-win!  If you're not completely sure of what you want to do career-wise, college--community and otherwise--is a good place to start. You are exposed to different areas of study, giving you the opportunity to try everything on and see what fits you best. Who knows? Maybe your calling doesn't involve college.   If you're not sure about becoming a police officer, as another poster suggested, try out security positions and see how you like it. Though you won't get the full taste of being an officer, you'll have somewhat of an idea of what it's like to be responsible for the safety of others and/or their property. If you really really want to know if being a police officer is what you want, contact your local department and ask if an officer would have time to answer any questions you may have and maybe even set up a ride-along.   Another option would be to make a list of hobbies (preferably ones you excel at) and see if there is a way to profit from any of them. I don't really recommend this as it could be a quick way to kill any passion for or enjoyment you get from this hobby, but I'm just tossing around ideas. You could also improve existing skills, which may involve taking classes within your community or workshops, making you more marketable.   Sorry for being so long-winded. I wanted to be as thorough as possible without writing an essay (oops). Hope this helps! If you've got any questions on what I've typed, or if something is unclear, don't hesitate to ask. Hesitation causes road rash... :)"

longboarding,3b8rqc,thewantedman,4,Sat Jun 27 13:46:47 2015 UTC,"Okay, I've spent about three and a half hours on this, and I've managed to find a few things that I need to relearn in order to complete the groundwork for a formula that models real turn as a function of baseplate angle. This'll allow me to input any baseplate angle between zero and 90, and receive the deepest turn angle that the truck can reach.   I'll expand upon it with another input for hanger rake, but it'll have to be solved as a constant with baseplate angle as the variable input still. That shouldn't be a problem though, since I don't know of any trucks with different hanger rake options. If there are, I can just balance the function to solve for rake with a constant baseplate angle.   Beyond that, I should be able to incorporate that function in to a larger formula for wheelbase and two trucks, so as to be able to find turn radius for any wheelbase/truck mix. No plans to try to model tkps right now, maybe I'll do that in a few weeks if this ends up working out. I think I'm just going to ignore bushings entirely, and just make the formula for absolute maximum turn angle. Bushings add a level of complexity that I just can't work with. I'd have to model force distribution, bushing compression, preload, and rider weight simultaneously, and it's not like anyone has data on bushing compression. I'd have to model compression characteristics for every bushing shape, formula, and washer combination and I have a life, so that's not going to happen.   anyways, bedtime. math in my spare time is oddly draining."

I would avoid running shoes and such for skating seeing as you have said you work out a fair bit because the sole on them will go away really quickly. I'm just assuming you're wearing running shoes, I did when I started.  To foot break you simply lift off your non dominant foot and gently place it on the ground, this will happen at first but avoid putting to much weight on your non dominant for when doing this. I suggest bending your knee in your dominant leg to get down low enough to footbreak and when you do try to get in the habit of putting the back of the heel down for the foot break and not the ball of the foot. Also still keep most of your weight on your dominant leg so when you're done with it you can get back on the board and keep your balance. But the more weight you have on your foot breaking foot the quicker you will slow down so you have fine tune how quickly you want to slow down once you get used to it"

I've tried footbreaking but I'm still stuttering and come to a complete stop when I do. Trying to improve my balance and as you said, learn how to move my weight in the right way. Thanks for all the advice, will try to get the heel down first next time. :)  One more question; after paddling I have a hard time getting my feet right (right foot dominant so 90 degrees to the left and evenly spaced) and instead I usually end up with my feet pointing forward, one a little angled so I can push the sides of the board and turn right and left. Is it just one of those things that comes with practice?"

It'll offer you a lot of stability, and you can actually run softer bushings than normal on it because of the change in truck leverage.  The rocker is pleasant for freeride, and the concave is just mellow enough in the middle that pushing isn't a chore.  It'll be a great deck for all around transportation, some freeride, some faster stuff mixed in, really whatever you want to do.  No kicktails though, so not great in areas with lots of curbs.  Essentially, it's a stripped down board with a well-defined purpose, and it does its job very well.  Hard to find faults in it other than the possibility of wheelbite if you go above 80mm wheels and the chance of dragging the belly if you're running worn down wheels on low trucks like tkps."

longboarding,3b8rqc,ellessdeeplz,0,Sat Jun 27 05:08:11 2015 UTC,"46* Aera k4s, I'm running mine 94/93 venoms. It takes a while to dial them in but once you do, dear god, you'll never want to ride anything else. It blows my mind how divey and fun they are at low speeds, carving into slides and turns so smoothly, and then bombing hills without a hint of instability. You can feel every penny under your feet and in my opinion they are the best truck money can buy."
longboarding,3b8rqc,sharpiefinepoint123,2,Sat Jun 27 01:11:34 2015 UTC,My 43 Paris V2s. I love the lean and they are super light and very lively.

I have no problem gripping a fast as shit hairpin, feeling the extra grip from the tall bushings and support pin, then go do sit downs and standups with just a wheel change. Im never selling these things"

longboarding,3b8j02,WallyWailord,3,Fri Jun 26 22:07:17 2015 UTC,Heck yeah man. It's got double kicks and nice concave for freeriding.
longboarding,3b8j02,AlanWattsUp,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:11:26 2015 UTC,Would the wheels be decent for freeride? Im thinking of maybe throwing on some butterballs or morongas

longboarding,3b4cwu,CHAINMAILLEKID,12,Thu Jun 25 22:26:00 2015 UTC,Kind of looks like a Land Yacht wolfshark.
longboarding,3b4cwu,ChaoticLogic,7,Fri Jun 26 00:08:17 2015 UTC,Looks like a mix between that and the ripple ridge
longboarding,3b4cwu,The_Weresquatch,4,Fri Jun 26 01:11:12 2015 UTC,looks like a darkside and a wolfshark had a baby and pumped it full of steroids
longboarding,3b4cwu,SlayerSkates,3,Fri Jun 26 01:11:05 2015 UTC,baconshark? yes plz
longboarding,3b4cwu,captain-happiness,3,Fri Jun 26 03:26:48 2015 UTC,What's the point of the ridge in the middle? Just seems like that would get in the way while pushing.
longboarding,3b4cwu,h3lme7,3,Thu Jun 25 23:54:33 2015 UTC,"It's less ""in the middle"" than it looks like in the photo... angles n' shit.  It's a forward positioned ripple meant to sit towards the rear of your front foot when in tuck.  Alternatively it's great for freeride if you've got a steezy stance back off the front truck lol"
longboarding,3b4cwu,WADES1,2,Fri Jun 26 13:38:55 2015 UTC,Could be to release stress from the concave or just points of reference for toeside predrifts for example.
longboarding,3b4cwu,SlayerSkates,4,Fri Jun 26 04:51:50 2015 UTC,tell that to the omen phoenix
longboarding,3b4cwu,h3lme7,-2,Fri Jun 26 01:10:41 2015 UTC,Could you provide an answer to my question instead of a more extreme example of ripple?
longboarding,3b4cwu,SlayerSkates,6,Fri Jun 26 01:42:34 2015 UTC,same point as the omen probably. The point of it in the phoenix is to provide a more natural angle to tuck on and add stability while making everything bit more drifty. Similar purpose here (I assume) but to a lesser degree.
longboarding,3b4cwu,mrtoxic6003,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:44:21 2015 UTC,"It look like a bit of flare right before a relief point. Its in a bit of an absurd place, but it is a freeride/downhill board so really there's no worries about it being uncomfy for pushing."
longboarding,3b4cwu,timruddell125,5,Fri Jun 26 11:43:42 2015 UTC,Bruh. You're meant to put something over you're bacon so it cooks evenly and doesn't unevenly curl. /s
longboarding,3b4cwu,mrtoxic6003,2,Thu Jun 25 23:57:48 2015 UTC,Its like a mix between a garuda and a lady liberty. I dont know what you guys are talking about it looks nothing like a wolfshark

longboarding,3b3qtf,lawn_gbord,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:55:29 2015 UTC,"What you should do is slide and TRY to lowside, so you know how it should feel, then progrees slowly stop leaning back as far so that youre standing up at a leaning backwards angle. Much easier than highsiding because you didnt lean far enough. Trust me falling on your ass/hands aint that bad."
longboarding,3b3qtf,ChemicalRain,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:02:24 2015 UTC,"Sorry, i may have my terms reversed when doing heelsides,   highsiding on a heelside is when you are lunged forward right? by not squatting/leaning back enough?  okay yeah then my problem is low siding. my tail bone is already majorly fucked from falls so now i fall subconsciously to my right or left, and my jutting out hip bone takes the beating.   im not even scaring of falling, i love falling because it means im pushing my limits, i just can't seem to stop whenever i try to break the wall of long slides"
longboarding,3b3qtf,lawn_gbord,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:16:23 2015 UTC,"Yes you are correct now. Honestly, learn heelside180's normal and switch. After you learn that, a heelside slide is basically just a really slow 180 that you dont bring back around all the way"
