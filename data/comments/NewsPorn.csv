On Wednesday, Greek Labor Minister Yiannis Vroutsis presented data to the parliament, explaining that almost 75% of Greek pensioners are trying to secure their early retirement through legal provisions that allow them to stop working before the age of 61.  “In the public sector, 7.91% of pensioners retire between the ages of 26 and 50, 23.64% between 51 and 55, and 43.53% between 56 and 61. In IKA, 4.44% of pensioners retire between the ages of 26 and 50, 12.83% retire between 51 and 55, and 58.61% retire between 56 and 61. Meanwhile, in the so-called healthy funds, 91.6% of people retire before the national retirement age limit,” Vroutsis said.   http://greece.greekreporter.com/2014/12/04/75-of-greek-pensioners-enjoy-early-retirement/"

NewsPorn,3bzyb1,Tomuchan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:28:38 2015 UTC,That doesn't exactly match the numbers you're claiming. 75% attempt to retire before 61. And the article doesn't confirm the national retirement age.
NewsPorn,3bzyb1,ProfShea,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:30:13 2015 UTC,"Because the number I'm claiming is an aggregate figure from various sources. Greece has been disingenuous about the actual figures forcing analysts to make broad estimates.   With regards to Greece's national retirement age I urge you once again to do your own research. But, since I'm here..   After the 2012 reforms the Greek national retirement age was raised to 61. However, prior to this point, the Greek national retirement age was 58 years old provided that the person had worked for 35 years. There was also some wiggle room for people to retire at 55 if they worked in hard labor/hazardous conditions or were willing to accept partial pensions.   While Greece has raised it's retirement age due to austerity measures and policy retrenchment the fact remains that those who were employed before 1993 are still eligible to retire earlier due to grandfather laws. As a result, what we see on paper is not quite the reality on the ground.   I do not mind that you are critical but the reason I have suggested that you do your own research is because you will quickly find how muddy the waters are for yourself. Greece's retirement age before 2012 is very unclear. The number of retirees is unclear. The average age of retirement before 2012 is unclear etc. Much of this is due to Greece's incompetency in terms of keeping track of and regulating it's own population and economy. In doing so I think you will see the bigger picture and understand the problem in Greece better."

I don't really think there are huge advantages to the US getting people into space themselves. It's not so hard, and I'm sure letting Russians do it is a fraction of the price in tax dollars.  If there was economic incentives, like space tours, more satellites, maybe investors would put money there, but until now, for economists, space has brought scientific research, which doesn't attract investors so much. So space has only been a net plus for the country as a whole, but it's not a clear process to really change the business model of scientific innovation. Or it did not change things enough. Or maybe too many people have lost this insight that technology can really improve society."

Said hypothetical crop would also take the photographer in the center and place him slightly off center left, making the composition more interesting. Everybody's attention is directed off camera right. This is typically not very interesting, as the story is now about the photojournalists and not the actual story of Marines landing on Staten Island (which now comes entirely from your title).

NewsPorn,33zph4,idiotwithacomputer,10,Mon Apr 27 10:09:06 2015 UTC,Yea when the most media coverage is there is when the worst people are there. I really enjoy Vice News and they had a series running with people at Ferguson through the protest. What I saw almost every single day for weeks was the exact opposite of what happened the night of the riots. Most people that were arrested where not from there and had come I believe with the intent to loot. It is a shame about what is happening and eventually something is going to break.
NewsPorn,33zph4,idiotwithacomputer,7,Mon Apr 27 10:14:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah Vice News is usually pretty good for this sort of stuff since they try to get amongst it. And I agree, racial tensions seem to be growing not only in the US but worldwide, there's going to be some pivotal events in the next 10 years."
NewsPorn,33zph4,aMazingBanannas,1 point,Mon Apr 27 08:16:27 2015 UTC,Tension in general is rising. The world is having a lot less war and violence but an increase in tension especially a dramatic increase of Xenophobia and Islamophobia.  Edit - I know in America Xenophobia was a big deal and still is with there now being a large fence on the border of Mexico. However it seems to becoming a much larger world wide issue. Since I don't have much prior knowledge to base how bad Xenophobia is right now this could just be a flair up.
NewsPorn,33zph4,idiotwithacomputer,7,Mon Apr 27 08:22:10 2015 UTC,"Xenophobia is far, far better than ever before. Yes, there are protests in the US over immigration and the spread of Islam but racial and ethnic violence is on the decline and people are fighting in the courtroom and over the airwaves, not by vigilante justice. I've lived in a border town before(actually on the Mexican side) and the fence is a mountain out of a mole hill. Mexican immigration has also been on the decline for over a decade and those cries of deporting them all and putting land mines across the southwest are limited to the shittier Fox pundits and shitty conspiracy websites. I don't know how much you've traveled outside the US but America really is one of the most tolerant nations in the world."

When we rightfully complain about unfair news coverage, we get blasted by conservatives that say stuff like, ""Lamestream media panders to blacks by portraying police officers as soulless pricks."" but then that news media flips and cries out against ""RIOTERS!"" and ""thug culture."""
NewsPorn,33zph4,frausting,-3,Mon Apr 27 10:12:35 2015 UTC,"All the talk in the world won't help anymore.

NewsPorn,33zph4,meatpuppet79,4,Mon Apr 27 15:10:23 2015 UTC,"Yes but talk leads to action America isn't gonna sit down though and watch people discuss and debate on what to do. The news then won't show it so they show violence of the protest. Which means the protests get larger and makes more noise but brings more bad apples. This causes the cycle we are in know.  What we saw in Taiwan shows what happens if a protest is not violent and is orderly, no one cared and with the fact it was not in America we sure as hell didn't care what was happening."
NewsPorn,33zph4,idiotwithacomputer,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:11:48 2015 UTC,"I tend to think debate and talk and discussion are all impossible at this point. On one side are some dreadfully racist views and opinions (quite often coming from the right of the political spectrum), and then perhaps even worse, there's a screeching, shrill social justice element that aggressively shouts down all views that don't perfectly align with its own, flying false accusations of 'racism' used to shut down or control the conversation (see also any discussion about feminism on the internet especially). Then somewhere between these two appalling poles, there are black people with entrenched victim mentalities, the blacks who act like thugs and monsters, the blacks who have found their identities in this social division, and of course those just trying to get by and live life well, their voices drowned out by all this stupidity."
NewsPorn,33zph4,meatpuppet79,3,Mon Apr 27 08:48:58 2015 UTC,We don't need a Bill O'Reilly and Jesse James figure up on a stage shouting at each other but two reasonable people that can discuss points and play devils advocate sometimes. Discussion and deescalation is not impossible. We need to remember that form the 60's to the 80's there were massive protest for just about everything that left cities on fire. We remember Rodney King and WTO riots but things had quieted down until recently. Things have been much worse before and are now getting worse however they have gotten better before and can get better again.

NewsPorn,2uljxc,cartoon_villain,2,Tue Feb 3 20:49:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert but I am fairly certain that it is actually a T-72 and not a T-90.  Because there is only one photograph thus one angle I found it really difficult to determine which it is.  The primary differentiating feature that is visible within the photograph is the ""guard"" (I am not sure of the pieces actual name) that is positioned above the tracks at the very front of the tank.  This piece is triangular with sharp edges on the T-90 whereas on the T-72 this piece is rounded.  Only a small portion of the piece can be seen on the tank in the photograph but it appears to be rounded.  Here is a diagram of the T-72.  This diagram shows the piece that I am referring to as the ""guard"" as being rounded.  I am repeating myself, but just to make sure were looking at the same thing, it is the portion that is to the very front and above the tank's track.  Here is a diagram of the T-90.  The same piece is angled and with sharp edges.  I had never even heard of the T-72 or T-90 prior to 30 minutes ago when I opened the comments of this thread and saw yours.  I literally just spent 45 minutes using Google Image Search trying to find differences between the tanks and then matching them to the photo.  The appearance of these tanks seems to be heavily dependent upon the individual tank's configuration which made it quite a bit more difficult than I originally anticipated.

NewsPorn,2qwe9p,Seven-Force,3,Wed Dec 31 15:34:19 2014 UTC,"Sorry you got down voted. Asking questions is always a good thing.  89 million barrels of oil are consumed in a single day (according to http://www.iea.org/aboutus/faqs/oil/). Six barrels of oil is considered to a ton of oil, and so the world consumes about 14.8 million tons of oil in a single day. So really the amount of oil that is used in a day is way too much for a single tank to make much of a difference. Also throw in that the tank will not be used in a single day, and it the oil in the tank will probably be sold in futures over the course of months. This further reduces the impact of it.  There are a couple of cases where blocking oil shipments resulting in increased prices. This includes things such as the closing of the Suez Canal in 1967, the Iran-Iraq war, and the burning oil fields during the Persian Gulf War. Really it would require a whole bunch of those tanks to be burned up. Maybe the on-going conflict and the reduced oil deliveries from a place like Libya as a whole country could affect oil prices."

NewsPorn,2p1301,vtjohnhurt,32,Sat Dec 13 00:16:19 2014 UTC,"I wasn't there for two reasons:  1) I wasn't invited. The event was organized by the Congressional Black Caucus and they chose only to invite staffers from certain offices.   2) As a professional staffer, I, and everyone in my office, believes that our job is a supportive one. It isn't appropriate for us to be on TV preaching views that our members may or may not support. My job is to support an elected official; no one voted for me. Similar to how the military can't engage in political activity while in uniform."

This isn't a white vs black thing. I'm white, I've been arrested under false pretenses which cost me $700 to get bailed out by a bondsman. No charges file. Never got that back. I've been pulled over, had my car searched, and had a gun pulled on me by a cop. Again, for no reason. I've had cops harass me while I was on my motorcycle, because they were ""bored and wanted to chase someone.""  Can I not join this movement? I despise the militarization and oppressiveness of the  police force as well. Hell, this just happened not to far from me (and where I have family): http://www.13wmaz.com/story/news/local/dublin/2014/12/10/david-hooks-shot-twice-in-back/20213383/ It's not just blacks who are being targeted here.
