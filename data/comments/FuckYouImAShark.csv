They have grown into the apex predator and will be around long after we nuke ourselves into oblivion.  Yes sometimes they get themselves into sticky situations(as seen in the gif) but its good to know that the second most powerful apex predator on this planet is capable of helping out from time to time.

FuckYouImAShark,2yh5ih,TrotBot,2,Tue Mar 10 16:52:03 2015 UTC,"""In utero"" just means ""in uterus"", which some sharks definitely have.  Typically the uterus is really long and stretched out, usually divided into two uterine ""horns"", but it's functionally very similar to a mammalian uterus.  Some - I think most - sharks give live birth.  The babies pop out of the momma shark as nearly fully developed miniatures of mom, much like baby deer or horses.  If you look on the belly between the dorsal fins of really young requiem sharks (eg blacktip, whitetip, sandbar, bull) or hammerheads you can even find a slit-shaped umbilical scar where the umbilical cord was once attached."

FuckYouImAShark,2yh5ih,iwrestledasharkonce,2,Tue Mar 10 18:10:06 2015 UTC,"For interest's sake:  All members of the class Chondrichthyes (sharks, skates, rays, and chimaera) have their eggs fertilized internally. Different species display different strategies for the development of said eggies.    Oviparity: Used by all skates and chimaera, as well as a minority of sharks. Fertilized eggs are enclosed in leathery membranes and laid for development outside the body (used by all skates and chimaera, few sharks). Ovoviviparity: Used by all rays and most sharks. Fertilized eggs develop in the oviduct (the butt-end of which enlarges and is known as the uterus). The pups hatch out and continue growing within the uterus getting nourishment from remaining yolk or in some species--unhatched eggs and sibling embryos. Eventually, the pups are birthed.  Viviparity: Used by some sharks. Fertilized eggs are nourished by yolk for inital development. Yolk sacs integrate with uterine wall to form a placental link--embryos receive nourished directly from the mother until birth.    Hope that makes sense. If you found my  midterm notes on shark reproduction riveting, take 5 and look up cases of shark parthenogenesis (the coolest way to make shark babies)."

FuckYouImAShark,2yejdp,brain_in_a_jar,3,Mon Mar 9 08:18:48 2015 UTC,"DYK that that when that water was tested they found everything from feces to extremely rare viruses to cocaine (!) in that water? Drug dealers actually approached the testers to see if there was a way to extract and essentially recycle their product for resale. The testers informed them that the amounts were too miniscule and difficult to isolate for the process to make sense financially. Pretty effing crazy if you ask me...  (This link is a review of the book I saw this fact in but not the fact itself, sorry)"
FuckYouImAShark,2yejdp,mikerhoa,2,Mon Mar 9 11:23:01 2015 UTC,"Most metropolitan sewers (until not too long ago, Venetian waste water drained directly into the canals, or derelict sewerage systems leaked into them) contain cocaine.  Zurich comes in third place after Amsterdam and Antwerp (German link, Google translate is your friend) in waste-water cocaine content.  English link.  It's not cocaine as such, but rather Benzoylecgonine, which is secreted by cocaine consumers and used as an indicator of cocaine consumption, so any stories of attempts by dealers to refine blow out of waste water would be impractical and probably apocryphal.  Here's a science-y reference, there are others."

FuckYouImAShark,2cz8m2,Sharkoffs,1 point,Fri Aug 8 20:05:59 2014 UTC,"i'm not too familiar with piano notations but the ""eyes"" are pauses. they mean hold the note for longer than you would usually. the blush under the left eye is a rest so you don't play a note. the rest, i think, indicates to play the chord and let it ring out ("">"" looking mark is a diminuendo and it means to gradually get quieter). if anyone could correct me that would be nice!"
FuckYouImAShark,2cz8m2,Bong-Iguana,1 point,Sat Aug 9 03:11:21 2014 UTC,"Pretty much all of it technically has a meaning (except the teeth and tail), but ultimately in this context it's all useless. The slurs that connect the half rests to the half note are meant to show they're part of the same phrase, which makes no sense in the context of the measure. The little carrot looking thing is an accent (martellato if you want to get fancy) meant to emphasize sharp, sudden loudness - redundant with the foritissimo. You're right about the diminuendo but typically you never use those on a single note because they're supposed to show a change that normally wouldn't be naturally achieved.  Maybe the tail has some meaning I've never come across that makes the rest of the notation make sense, but ultimately I think the arranger was just having some fun. I could be wrong, but based on the other measures this looks like a practice piece for learning chords."

FuckYouImAShark,2c4egs,GenoZx,2,Wed Jul 30 12:35:51 2014 UTC,"Usually better to go for the eyes.  If you go for the nose and miss, or your hand slips, you'll be right in their toothy mouths.  Plus the nose is kind of a neutral area for sharks; it's not terribly sensitive and I don't think they'd care much.  Poke it - not punch it - in the eyes.  If it gets too gnarly, you ought to be carrying a dive knife anyway... go for the gills.  But more to the point, if you scuba dive or snorkel around sharks, learn to recognize agonistic behavior, the exaggerated movements they often make when they want you out of their space.  Compare the more relaxed swimming at the beginning of this video to when the diver approaches closer to the shark.  It's thrashing its whole body side to side, its pectoral fins are pointed down, and its spine is bent.  Sharks do NOT normally swim like that.  When they start displaying like that, get the fuck out of there.  A cornered dog rarely bites before it growls, and a cornered shark rarely bites before it does a threat display.  It doesn't want to tangle with you, so it's telling you, ""Get out of here or I'll MAKE you get out!""  You'll notice that it takes quite a while and quite a bit of harassment from the diver before the shark attacks him."

FuckYouImAShark,281g16,arkindal,7,Fri Jun 13 09:46:05 2014 UTC,"Biologist here. Great White sharks are a threat to humans when you look like their natural prey; seals. From above in your black wetsuit, maybe on a surfboard or boogie board you look like a plump, delicious treat. Head on or if the shark is next to you, you look like something foreign and definitely not a seal so probably not worth their time. Most Great White attacks end once the shark has taken a bite and realises you are not the droids food they were looking for. Do I recommend running out to swim with them? Not a great idea and do so at your own risk. They are still dangerous animals, but not the blood thirsty monsters many people think they are."
FuckYouImAShark,281g16,Alantha,3,Fri Jun 13 13:35:51 2014 UTC,"I've read something about that, it still look so scary tho.  I doubt I'd be able to do something like that. Specially because I have a phobia for what I can't see (dark, deep water) and well, swimming with a shark would probably mean not only being near something that could kill me any second, but also being where I can't see."
FuckYouImAShark,281g16,Alantha,2,Fri Jun 13 16:12:23 2014 UTC,"We have a natural distrust of things we can't see. Humans have evolved to depend on eyesight a bit more than our other senses, so when we can't see it gets a little scary. Obviously we can and do function without sight, but in general we rely on it. I get the same tinge of fear myself when entering a pond or lake where I can't see the bottom. Now the chances of something in hat pond or lake capable of doing me serious harm is pretty slim (though never underestimate a hungry/angry snapping turtle!) and I can tell myself ""Alantha, your fear is unfounded,"" but being afraid was what kept my ancestors safe and permeates to modern day. So don't be ashamed, especially when it comes to sharks. It's in your genes!"
FuckYouImAShark,281g16,Alantha,3,Fri Jun 13 16:48:33 2014 UTC,"I guess it partially is in my genes, but it also is a phobia I guess.  I literally am afraid of monsters, even tho I know they do not exist. Oh well.  Sharks are fascinating tho even if they scare me, they are indeed beautiful animals."
FuckYouImAShark,281g16,Alantha,3,Fri Jun 13 17:00:45 2014 UTC,"On a side note, out of curiosity I checked your submitted posts to see if there was anything biology related and I was excited to see you posted a few times in another of my favorite subreddits, /r/spiders, I know this is random but just wanted to say it.

I am fascinated by crocs, gators and snakes tho.  I also keep a type of pet that is usually considered pest.  While we are at it, do you mind if I ask why sharks sometimes act curious? Like the one in this video?  Curiosity is a sympton of intelligence, so I guess sharks must be pretty smart? Or they are not actually curious?"

FuckYouImAShark,27pl49,Crushnaut,1 point,Mon Jun 9 17:49:46 2014 UTC,I don't get why the shark had to have been eaten at all. Couldn't the tag have fallen off and been eaten? Or perhaps it was picked off by a Remora (or other helper fish) and eaten then that fish was eaten.
FuckYouImAShark,27pl49,tunersharkbitten,3,Mon Jun 9 23:04:19 2014 UTC,Because as it went deeper the temperature went up... To internal body temperature. Also those tags are semi sub dermal.  Very hard for a fish to eat it off of the shark.
FuckYouImAShark,27pl49,Crushnaut,2,Mon Jun 9 23:54:11 2014 UTC,"I do understand that the tracker was most likely eaten, but I do not see why the shark had to have been eaten as well.

FuckYouImAShark,1zun0j,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Mar 8 06:00:40 2014 UTC,"Zeno's paradoxes:       Zeno's paradoxes are a set of philosophical problems generally thought to have been devised by Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea (ca. 490–430 BC) to support Parmenides's doctrine that contrary to the evidence of one's senses, the belief in plurality and change is mistaken, and in particular that motion is nothing but an illusion. It is usually assumed, based on Plato's Parmenides (128a-d), that Zeno took on the project of creating these paradoxes because other philosophers had created paradoxes against Parmenides's view. Thus Plato has Zeno say the purpose of the paradoxes ""is to show that their hypothesis that existences are many, if properly followed up, leads to still more absurd results than the hypothesis that they are one."" (Parmenides 128d). Plato has Socrates claim that Zeno and Parmenides were essentially arguing exactly the same point (Parmenides 128a-b).

Well, if the frog begins at 1 and jumps for half each time then the frog would be at .5 after his first jump, .25 at his second jump, .125 at his third jump, and .0009765625 by his tenth jump. The point is, no matter how many times the frog jumps, he will never reach 0 and in a graph, that would form a curve called the asymptote."

FuckYouImAShark,1xvpkl,st00pitr0b0t,2,Fri Feb 14 14:07:37 2014 UTC,"The only gun designed in existence to have the plane built around it.  Typically, a plane is built, and you then outfit the plane with weapons that will fit it/capable of carrying.  This gun, is larger than a VW Beetle, and had to have the A10 Warthog designed specifically to carry this monster of a gun."
FuckYouImAShark,1xvpkl,bigbossodin,3,Fri Feb 14 14:42:21 2014 UTC,"fun fact: the gun produces more thrust than one of the two engines powering the A-10. If it were to lose one engine (pretending it wouldn't immediately go into emergence maneuvers), firing the weapon would significantly slow the aircraft down, potentially to the point of stalling"
FuckYouImAShark,1xvpkl,abl0ck0fch33s3,1 point,Fri Feb 14 20:25:50 2014 UTC,"It actually produces more recoil forces than both engines combined, yet it only slows the aircraft down slightly when fired. This is because the gun is fired in short bursts, and the plane is generally in about a 30-degree dive when it's used. So the added force of gravity, plus the short burst, prevents the gun from slowing down the plane too much.  Probably if you shot off all the rounds at once, with an engine out, you could stall it, but there's absolutely no good reason to do that.  A much bigger problem (at least during testing) was that the exhaust gases from the gun had no oxygen in it, and thus caused the engines to flame out. They had to redesign the engines so that they would no longer flame out due to the gun being fired."
