Andy and Erin were a terrible couple, very annoying. The writers tried to make them the next Jim and Pam, realized the characters sucked together, and decided to tear them apart. Pete was created to try to remedy that, but it wasn't that in-depth a story and not that interesting of one. Jim and Pam's fighting was to give them more of a story since their relationship (as a plot point) was growing stale. S1-3 covered their friendship and building up to their relationship, S4 covered their dating, S5 was their engagement (and pregnancy at the end), S6 was their marriage and first birth. After that, there wasn't much substance there so they decided to make their marriage strained. As for Will Ferrell, he and Steve Carell worked well in Anchorman, and they had good chemistry on screen for the couple episodes they were together in, but as an individual character, Deangelo was awkward, unfunny, and just all around weird (not even in a good way like RC).

DunderMifflin,3dv6v1,domoarigatodrloboto,5,Mon Jul 20 16:21:27 2015 UTC,"For Charles, I think Charles was portrayed as a pretty poor judge of character. He made Stanley the ""productivity czar"" and let his personal dislike of Jim affect his ability to evaluate him fairly. It would make sense for him to think of Kevin as a good worker.  For DeAngelo, he saw Kevin as one of the guys.   For Robert, it was kind of like a double negative: Kevin was so stupid that he appeared smart. RC had a very unconventional way of thinking, so when he hears ideas like Kevin's ""oatmeal cookie"" situation, he interprets it as a metaphor for business instead of a hungry dude just talking about food.  By the time Andy came along, Kevin didn't really need to be seen as smart anymore. I think Andy knew exactly how stupid Kevin was, but they had been friends for years and the branch was still performing well, so there was no need to take any action."

The first time I watched the show, I was hoping that Erin and Andy would end up together ever since the 12 days of christmas episode, and when they didn't, I was really upset. I feel like the writers felt that they had overused the characters of Jim and Pam, and the only way they could think of to create some sort of plot was to threaten their relationship. Whenever I rewatch the show, I don't even bother with more than half the episodes in season 9 because they're just not that good to me."

The Dinner Party is also amazing, because it's so painfully uncomfortable to watch. Then of course Niagara part 2. I feel the best episodes have Michael Scott.

DunderMifflin,3dlm33,randomclock,60,Fri Jul 17 12:17:30 2015 UTC,"Jim actually did a lot of dick things.  He was great for comedy, and he and Pam were cute, but if he were a real-life person he would often pretty much be a douchebag.  I mean, I know I'm overanalyzing a sitcom, but how hard would it have been for Jim to just say, ""Oh, sorry man"" and pour his coffee into the Snoopy mug, rinse out Andy's mug, and hand it to him?  He was just playing a grown-up version of keep-away.  Then there's the whole Dwight situation.  Dwight is clearly socially and/or developmentally disabled.  Maybe with Asperger's Syndrome or something else on the autism spectrum.  But Jim bullies the hell out of him.  Yeah, Dwight behaves obnoxiously and kinda ""has it coming"".  But that's because he's clearly not firing on all thrusters.  TL;DR - Jim is, in his own words, ""not a perfect person""."

But we as a culture have become far too flippant with the concepts of aspergers and autism, and frequently people with little or no medical knowledge will feel comfortable throwing around ad hoc diagnoses. That is not conducive to real  understanding of mental illness.   Weird people should be referred to as weird. Strange people should be known as strange. Leave the medical terminology to the medical community.   Furthermore, it makes it impossible to think anything Dwight does is funny."
DunderMifflin,3dlm33,dsjunior1388,4,Fri Jul 17 19:23:11 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point.  I probably shouldn't have brought mental illness into the discussion.  My point stands as is, though.  Dwight is very different, and Jim bullies him for it."

What does Jim do?  NAILS Dwight in the FACE with a snowball, just in response to some minor teasing.

I really don't think Catherine Tate was a  good fit for the show, and I can't even work out how she ended up on the show in the first place.

I was able to tolerate her during her tenure with the Sabre store, but then she just shows up in Scranton like act like she's a regular. She goes on for a while without any character development like she's not gonna be on the show for long, but then they try to explore her a little bit by giving her that little sob story with the magician and wanting to adopt a kid, but they don't really do anything with that. They kind of just introduce her as some power hungry bitch, give her this irrelevant backstory, and after that she loses the only character trait that made her stick out. The only time I liked her was in the ""Work Bus"" episode when her and Erin bond over her wanting to adopt a child. This was more of the kind of development se needed.  Also, I absolutely loathe her annoying British accent."
DunderMifflin,3dru6u,silvershark76,4,Sun Jul 19 01:18:43 2015 UTC,Because she was introduced as a weirdo British boss lady who works for Sabre that overstayed her welcome once the Florida episodes were done.

The problem with Robert California is that he was very inconsistent, and went from being this enigma of a man who people were both creeped out by and seeked the approval of to just a straight up decadent pervert. This is made even worse again thanks to the Nellie plotline where he becomes this guy desperate to please her and do whatever she wants."

DunderMifflin,3dotfi,aubreythez,3,Sat Jul 18 03:27:28 2015 UTC,"I thought it was interesting because at the beginning of the series, you really felt bad for Toby (and it was apparent that you, as the audience, were supposed to), because he seemed like a genuinely nice guy that the boss was a dick to.  When Michael left, however, and Toby couldn't be his punching bag anymore, Toby started becoming irritating (the Scranton strangler storyline, his mystery novels, etc.). In a way, you, the audience member, as well as the rest of the office, had to fill that Michael role of hating Toby.   To be fair, I did feel bad for him in the end, because he was the only one who didn't get a ""happy"" ending."

It's also really rude to hit on a waitress (not that it looked like Michael and Andy were overtly hitting on Cindy), because they aren't in a position to be honest, as you're their customer and they have to keep you happy or risk getting in trouble.  Also, Cindy mentions that she has school. As a college aged woman, can't say I'd ever go to an office Christmas party with two random guys in their forties with the personalities of Michael Scott and Andy, unless it was to laugh about it later (which seems kind of cruel).

DunderMifflin,3dm6tb,WheresTheSauce,6,Fri Jul 17 20:45:42 2015 UTC,"I just find him to be an unlikable character.

DunderMifflin,3dm6tb,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,3,Fri Jul 17 14:48:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree. I was unclear about whether his ""agreeability"" was a direct result of his anger management, or a poor personality trait. I hate it when people play all sides to get people to like them."
DunderMifflin,3dm6tb,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,3,Fri Jul 17 19:50:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the only thing that he keeps from ""old Andy"" is the need to be an ass-kisser and play all sides.

When they stopped using that, the characters were free to be their own thing, rather than suffering the burden of thinking they have to emulate a predecessor.

I'm no saint, I've made them and laughed at them before, but I try not to do that at all. My main thing was when Kelly tried to claim she was raped because that's a pretty screwed up thing to do.

DunderMifflin,3dgz9e,buffchixdip,4,Thu Jul 16 04:54:50 2015 UTC,"I feel exactly the same! But I think they tried to show how he matured once he had a family. But in a way I was kind of sad, because I liked awkward Michael."
DunderMifflin,3dgz9e,Marjoke,4,Thu Jul 16 06:41:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, i also don't understand why nobody went to Michael's wedding (supposedly he got married?)"
DunderMifflin,3dgz9e,Reedy99,2,Thu Jul 16 14:15:51 2015 UTC,"Well from a production standpoint, Steve Carrell wasn't working for the show.  From a storyline standpoint, they were in Colorado."
DunderMifflin,3dgz9e,LetsGoJesus123,3,Fri Jul 17 01:46:21 2015 UTC,"He didn't want to overshadow the finale. And Steve said it best (might not be a verbatim quote), but he said that he most likely had come back to visit everyone at Scranton in between his leaving and the finale. Maybe not in ""the office"", but to see everyone. However, like when he took off the mic in his goodbye, he no longer felt the need to be on camera. He had Holly and a family. That was his life now."
DunderMifflin,3dgz9e,jmunson25,3,Fri Jul 17 06:04:08 2015 UTC,"I really wanted to see more of Holly, too. She was possibly my favorite character"
DunderMifflin,3dgz9e,Rymbeld,5,Thu Jul 16 09:30:39 2015 UTC,How? I'm genuinely curious.
DunderMifflin,3dgz9e,ogyoungkee,3,Thu Jul 16 20:10:57 2015 UTC,"Well, the shallow reason is that I think she's insanely hot.   But otherwise her introduction helps to humanize and round out the character of Michael Scott--he's no longer an extreme weirdo, but finds Home and his other self. He's such a weird guy, out of step with everyone, but with her he can completely be who he is. The proposal episode was incredibly fucking sweet and romantic.  Holly is a lot like him, but with her introduction we see that oddball personality type made real, rather than a cartoon. I think many characters in The Office are cartoonish and not rounded people. In many ways, it's the Jim and Pam Show. But with Holly, she's awkward, but there's depth there, and she underscores the fact that Michael Scott is also a real person rather than a cartoon--he's actually really sensitive and insecure. I felt that when her character was introduced, the quality of the show really soared, and I loved that even when she was out for an entire season we were still aware of her in the background (as I watched season 6 I kept wondering where she was, what she was doing, etc)."
DunderMifflin,3dgz9e,Rymbeld,2,Thu Jul 16 20:38:39 2015 UTC,I respect this. Not a holly fan but you do raise some good points

A devil's name."
DunderMifflin,3dh2j6,BroadShoulderedBeast,2,Thu Jul 16 22:25:20 2015 UTC,"To be fair, a lot of people believed the theory before that episode aired. I personally was expecting it to be Creed because he's crazy (especially when he showed up to the halloween party in what appears to be blood), but after that episode, I didn't even question it."
DunderMifflin,3dh2j6,Girafarigging,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:43:10 2015 UTC,"They actually teased it a little bit though.  At some point in season 9 Toby and Jim are talking about couples therapy.  Clark walks in and Toby yells at him to get out... then utters under his breath ""I'm... gonna kill him"".   It was sort of a crazy theory they ran with a little but but simultaneously wished to debunk.  What didn't work so well was the fan theory that an enraged George Howard Skub strangled Toby after Toby confessed about framing Skub."

In regard to saying it just to your friends, one author wrote: ""when “retard” and “retarded” are used as synonyms for “dumb” or “stupid” by people without disabilities, it only reinforces painful stereotypes of people with intellectual disabilities being less valued members of humanity.""  Using a descriptor that applies to a small group of people as an insult to someone does reinforce negative perceptions of the small group.

DunderMifflin,3d835j,what_up_with_that,31,Tue Jul 14 13:39:25 2015 UTC,I'm genuinely surprised at the amount of people in here who didn't know where accounting sat :)
DunderMifflin,3d835j,3ebfan,11,Tue Jul 14 13:03:43 2015 UTC,Here is an image to help people understand. S6Ep13  I'll try and add more for reference as I rewatch this episode! :D  EDIT: I think I found out why people think accounting is in the other corner different. It's because throughout the whole series there are frequent quick shots that go from this angle to this angle instantanously which makes you forget there is a camera man. There isn't any camera motion blur inbetween these shots so you think it is a quick 180 degree shot. When actuality it is like this picture!
DunderMifflin,3d835j,grey_sky,8,Tue Jul 14 15:45:59 2015 UTC,"But the Jim/Dwight desk unit is in both, not an excuse."
DunderMifflin,3d835j,TheBroox,4,Tue Jul 14 16:33:25 2015 UTC,Ya Im not understanding the confusion. That first pic you posted clearly shows accounting right behind reception. Receptions clearly right at the front door. Michaels office is clearly 5 feet from reception.
DunderMifflin,3d835j,MildlyImpressive,3,Tue Jul 14 19:25:06 2015 UTC,"Well I think it's because the Office is shot different than what we experience in mostly every other cinematic experience. It tries to allude to the fact that there is a film crew there which limits the angles and motion of the camera. However, there clearly are shots that don't make sense for a film crew. Like, they'll show the backside of Andy talking to Erin to see Erin's reaction then they'll quickly switch to the backside of Erin to see Andy's reaction but there isn't a camera guy behind Andy. If you mix these two points together, it can create a slight confusion of orientation for the average viewer.   Now, this is all guesswork. I know that Accounting is behind reception but sometimes I find myself thinking they are in the back corner where Darrell's office is. This occurs even though I've seen the full series around 10 times. Again, I think it is the way the camera angles are shot that causes disorientation."

DunderMifflin,3d835j,frenchiethefry94,6,Tue Jul 14 14:19:54 2015 UTC,Probably a folding table which they set in the stairwell or in the storage room where the camera crew is set up near Meredith's desk.

Then he'd walk back to apologize and he'd change his mind when he got there. He'd call him an idiot under his breathe and then knock over his pencil cup and close his laptop as he's walking away.

And because of Pam's partition you don't see anybody and forget people could be working behind there.  Since it seems like most of action happens around Jim/Pam/Michaels areas, when you see the accounting area and no one else in site, I just imagine they are as far away as possible from that area, which would be the opposite corner.  I also just assumed when Darryl had his office, they built it for him and relocating accounting. It never occurred to me that there was an office all along, since I don't recall seeing it prior."

DunderMifflin,3dcjs2,buymymeth,2,Wed Jul 15 05:13:25 2015 UTC,That doesn't look like pretzel day to me!
DunderMifflin,3dc577,mrpickle131,7,Wed Jul 15 03:01:55 2015 UTC,"yeah they had people in the first season that had no real purpose to the story, the reason for this was other than a few characters (Michael, Dwight, Jim, and Pam) they weren't sure who they were gonna keep and they didn't figure out till season 2"
DunderMifflin,3dc577,randomactofgold,0,Wed Jul 15 03:17:30 2015 UTC,Maybe thats why there is only 6 episodes in the firet season
DunderMifflin,3dc577,randomactofgold,6,Wed Jul 15 03:20:48 2015 UTC,"well that and they pretty much followed the plot to the British office almost shot for shot, like season 1 of the British Office has 6 episodes as well"
DunderMifflin,3dc577,michaelt4,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:24:53 2015 UTC,Only for the pilot.
DunderMifflin,3dc577,Ashantis_Sideburns,2,Wed Jul 15 20:15:52 2015 UTC,Most of the time the first season is always shorter then any of its other seasons. Mainly because they dont know how the public will receive the show so they dont invest as much into it the first season in case it gets cancelled.
DunderMifflin,3dc577,WatchOutRadioactiveM,2,Wed Jul 15 06:10:41 2015 UTC,"Yes you do. Random workers show up through the beginning of season 3. You see plenty in season 2. In 3, I think you only see one in the annex, during one shot in the one of the first couple episodes of the season."

DunderMifflin,3d6sws,Brolympia,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:08:51 2015 UTC,Hey everyone. So I'm mrjamma on Redbubble (the guy that designed this) and I have to say thanks for the recent surge in purchased of this design over the past few days! Any ideas you have for Dunder Mifflin based designs would be appreciated!
DunderMifflin,3d9xev,k_hall_313,17,Tue Jul 14 17:20:57 2015 UTC,Definitely! It actually gets really great and they wrap up the show so nicely
DunderMifflin,3d9xev,Cmbaugh,17,Tue Jul 14 18:01:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, but Michael is a big loss. But i always thought that the other characters' stories don't just finish when Michael's does. Plus, you are missing the enigma that is Robert California."
DunderMifflin,3d9xev,YesWeCannabis32,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:20:17 2015 UTC,The Robert list is always one of the few scenes I always remember with everyone trying to understand what they mean. There was some good stuff after Michael but it wasn't the same. The office is just too good
DunderMifflin,3d9xev,mrsodafountainjoy,7,Wed Jul 15 06:19:47 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, you should."
DunderMifflin,3d9xev,justaskfrank,4,Wed Jul 15 00:42:11 2015 UTC,It is definitely hit and miss after Michael leaves. I thought that the episodes were ok compared to the seasons with Michael. Then when they brought in Nelly they hit rock bottom but redeemed themselves with the last few episodes. The series finale is definitely worth the watch but you have to watch the episodes in between to understand whats happening
DunderMifflin,3d9xev,Lumbur,3,Tue Jul 14 21:51:23 2015 UTC,Of course its worth it. All the characters really come into their own and shine w/o Michael in my opinion
DunderMifflin,3d9xev,lifeisabeach63,5,Tue Jul 14 23:13:35 2015 UTC,Definately! Controversially (on this sub anyway) season 9 is my favourite!
DunderMifflin,3d9xev,kelsasaurusrex,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:39:56 2015 UTC,Why is it your favorite? I'm honestly just curious
DunderMifflin,3d9xev,wes-slamclam,2,Wed Jul 15 04:12:05 2015 UTC,"On my first watch through, I hated Michael Scott. I know, I know... What's wrong with me, right!? So any season without him was a bonus fore. I also just loved Dwight and Angela's coming back together and I loved Dwight finally being in charge. I've since watched the whole series through another 3 or 4 times and season 3 is a close second for my favourite, maybe another watch through and it'll edge into first place!"
DunderMifflin,3d9xev,kelsasaurusrex,3,Fri Jul 17 15:17:24 2015 UTC,"It's worth watching at least once through.  There are some good episodes in seasons 8 and 9.  It's not the same, though.  Still, worth a watch."
DunderMifflin,3d9xev,portmanteautruck,2,Tue Jul 14 20:49:44 2015 UTC,"Even if you think it is inferior, it is still great TV."
DunderMifflin,3d9xev,FrancisCastiglione12,2,Wed Jul 15 01:29:32 2015 UTC,It is definitely worth watching! But you will miss him!
DunderMifflin,3d9xev,Marjoke,2,Wed Jul 15 12:33:31 2015 UTC,"For me, no. I'll watch some random Season 8 episodes if they come on, but I stick to Seasons 2-6 mostly and even then, the show starts to spread itself too thin following the Sabre takeover and introducing characters like Gabe and the Tallahassee CEO (Kathy Bates i think)  Some Season 9 episodes are good. I haven't watched all of them yet."
DunderMifflin,3d9xev,rchaud,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:34:02 2015 UTC,"I agree somewhat, but if you haven't watched the show through completely I would say watch it"
DunderMifflin,3d9xev,wes-slamclam,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:09:50 2015 UTC,gabe was a decent addition. He had quite a few memorable lines.
DunderMifflin,3d79yp,DarleneBundren,13,Tue Jul 14 01:58:06 2015 UTC,It doesn't include the best part when he comes out from behind the vending machine by the plant.

DunderMifflin,3d6ima,toastfactory,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:02:19 2015 UTC,"I always think that line came from the episode where Gabe and Erin host the Glee party at their house, but the screen grab says I'm wrong. Did he say anything like this at that episode too??"

DunderMifflin,3d938h,chadunn13,17,Tue Jul 14 14:23:33 2015 UTC,Hay Place? More like Pay Place.
DunderMifflin,3d938h,longrifle,7,Tue Jul 14 14:28:04 2015 UTC,Thanksgiving? More like Thanksforgiving me your money.
DunderMifflin,3d938h,FrancisCastiglione12,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:30:38 2015 UTC,Maybe his sister came to town for the Hay Place!  It would have been an integral part of her childhood as well as Dwight and Moes.
DunderMifflin,3d938h,regular-wolf,2,Wed Jul 15 21:14:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah but in the Farm episode I think Dwight says he's never met his nephew before. Also, his sister lives far away and Dwight is disappointed in her for becoming ""normal"" and not retaining her Schrute heritage"
DunderMifflin,3d938h,chadunn13,6,Thu Jul 16 12:09:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I always thought that maybe he started out in graphic design and just coincidentally started working IT for Dunder Mifflin later on."
