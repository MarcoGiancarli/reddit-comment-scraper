AbandonedPorn,3e1z3f,Ekks-O,17,Tue Jul 21 12:13:09 2015 UTC,It makes me quite sad that such a beautiful building was destroyed like this. It also seems that the seigneur was a progressive man who was a victim of la Terreur.
AbandonedPorn,3e1z3f,ButterBalls1712,8,Tue Jul 21 12:27:28 2015 UTC,"Actually Laborde lost the castle before the Revolution, he was forced to sell it right after its completion to the Duke of Penthièvre. The castle was abandoned when its new owner died in 1793, and dismantled for building materials a few years later."

There are some wealthy people who decide to restore them, but some quickly realize it's a huge amount of work, it's hard to get the materials, specialized workers, and that it will all end up being a huge upkeep just to keep it from becoming a ruin again.  But working on that specific castle? You could probably get a mansion on an island with a yacht for less than the restoration cost."
AbandonedPorn,3e1z3f,Asshai,3,Tue Jul 21 14:33:41 2015 UTC,"All over Europe, actually. Some are reeeeally cheap (like in the €500,000-€750,000 range... considering we're talking about castles here), but often require mandatory maintenance. In Germany, we've even got a thing called ""Denkmalschutz"", essentially an protection act for historical buildings, which forces owners of these properties to stick to a shitload of regulations, making even maintaining a regular old house really expensive. Check out this German website."

You built a house like that for your wife, for her status in the community and to demonstrate to her and to everyone what a good provider you were, and you built it for your children and grandchildren, as a family seat.   Those are younger trees, so the original trees, if any, are long gone.  Someone has recently planted a new tree in the foreground, within the last 10 years I'd say, so I wonder if there were once plans to renovate the house. Someone is certainly keeping up the yard."
AbandonedPorn,3dwbb6,GrandmaGos,2,Mon Jul 20 01:56:09 2015 UTC,"There's also two other buildings in the background. Potentially another house and a barn. If I had to guess, I'm going to say the current owner likely uses the property for work, maybe even still lives there, but just hasn't torn down the house.  Renovating it looks to be a tall task. (At least) Two large holes in the roof, that look to have been there for some time. Broken windows that haven't been boarded up. Tearing it down takes time and money. Might not be worth it at this point and time."
AbandonedPorn,3dwbb6,TheCurseOfJamesDolan,3,Mon Jul 20 12:49:07 2015 UTC,I am from rural Illinois. These houses are getting increasingly more common as small family farms are bought out by larger operations. And yes the shed/barns are probably in use but I doubt anyone lives on the property. I am sure the story goes that some farmer's aging mother is widowed and then gets too old to keep up a big house like this on her own. She moves to a nursing home but the family has too much sentimental value in the house to tear it down.
AbandonedPorn,3dwbb6,onthemoveactivist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:33:09 2015 UTC,Tearing it down takes time and money.    Donate it to be burned down by the fire department. I read that they are always looking to do training in houses like these.

My old landlady used to live there, I visited the place about twenty years ago, and I met Oliver and Caroline Colthurst who owned it before they lost everything in the Lloyd's Insurance names scandal and had to return it to the nation.  It was a fascinating place. It had a grade I listed half-timbered black and white tree house, believed to be the oldest in Britain. Its timber beams were not black, despite the availability of pitch from the nearby pitch well from which the estate derives part of its name, but a dark muddy brown from the ox blood they were traditionally treated with - Wikipedia begs to differ but I was told this by one of the Colthurst children.  And the Colthurst family were proper bonkers toffs - IIRC Caroline's dad had his leg bitten off by a lion but that didn't stop him achieving all sorts of toff stuff.  My connections to the place are pretty tenuous, but I'm genuinely shocked and saddened that such a lovely pile has come to this."

AbandonedPorn,3du3r4,BahamanIcecream,10,Sun Jul 19 14:10:07 2015 UTC,How is this still abandoned! Are there some kind of support or frame issues that make it too expensive to fix up?
AbandonedPorn,3du3r4,666Evo,9,Sun Jul 19 18:58:04 2015 UTC,England's historically listed buildings are notorious for being tough fixer upers. Most of the time you can barely change anything on the actual building so fixes become prohibitively expensive very quickly.
AbandonedPorn,3du3r4,the0rthopaedicsurgeo,2,Mon Jul 20 01:02:11 2015 UTC,"They try to preserve history by protecting the look of old buildings, inside and out, but at the same time it means no one wants to preserve them because it makes them much more expensive, and you can't really modernise them too much because even things like interior doorframes have to be true to the originals, even where the originals are long since gone.  There should obviously be a lot more leeway, otherwise buildings like this are left abandoned and then the entire thing collapses, so where's the sense in that?"
AbandonedPorn,3du3r4,666Evo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:05:44 2015 UTC,"That's exactly right. In trying to preserve the buildings, they've made the laws so prohibitive that nobody will restore them. Obviously having the polar opposite effect of letting the building waste away.    It's a real shame."
AbandonedPorn,3du3r4,FusRoDahMa,5,Mon Jul 20 21:52:35 2015 UTC,I love the colors on the walls.  How fantastic it all must have been in its prime.
AbandonedPorn,3du3r4,BertDeathStare,5,Sun Jul 19 20:04:32 2015 UTC,"Looks beautiful on the outside, but the rooms on the inside creep me out for some reason, and it's not even dark."
AbandonedPorn,3du3r4,XCorneliusX,4,Sun Jul 19 18:13:53 2015 UTC,I am intrigued by it inside and out.  It would not be inconceivable that it would have hidden passages and rooms.

AbandonedPorn,3du3r4,wewd,10,Sun Jul 19 18:54:41 2015 UTC,"And it's not 'cladding' of any sort. That's how timber frames were built at the time. It's all structural bracing, albeit with an artistic flair."

AbandonedPorn,3du3r4,Chaos_Philosopher,-6,Sun Jul 19 19:04:25 2015 UTC,What cladding style is it?  Tudor.   Does that help you read the sentence?
AbandonedPorn,3du3r4,slothrr,9,Mon Jul 20 02:02:54 2015 UTC,"In architectural terms, cladding is non-structural and cosmetic. Most of the timbers you see here are giving strength to the building. The white infill you see is interwoven strips of wood think like a wicker basket, smothered with a mixture of mud and hair and painted with a lime wash. This technique is known as wattle and daub."

AbandonedPorn,3do7xj,buscoamigos,42,Sat Jul 18 02:53:55 2015 UTC,It happens all the time. The contractors built the houses. Not enough people moved in. Or they ran out of money. Foreclosed. Bank took possession. So the houses just sit there.
AbandonedPorn,3do7xj,owlthathurt,28,Sat Jul 18 03:10:16 2015 UTC,Why is there no roads? Is it normal to build houses without a road built first?
AbandonedPorn,3do7xj,772751,33,Sat Jul 18 04:22:34 2015 UTC,That is weird. I'm guessing they had gravel roads that eventually grew over. The government takes care of the roads so I'm assuming that once the development folded and the money disappeared that they obviously didn't pave. It's also possible that it was just a huge money laundering scheme. Which wouldn't be unheard of.
AbandonedPorn,3do7xj,owlthathurt,17,Sat Jul 18 04:30:56 2015 UTC,"I lived in a newly built neighborhood in Texas for a while. My family had one of the first, if not the first house in the neighborhood. The main road was packed gravel up until to the model homes. Past that they had loose gravel. They waited until a few more houses were done until they actually paved the roads. The roads were paved by the development company. They waited because they needed to dig out a bayou/retention pond for the storm drains to empty out into."
AbandonedPorn,3do7xj,517634,6,Sat Jul 18 10:53:38 2015 UTC,I have seen a number of communities where the hoa maintains the roads. I don't know in this case but it is not unheard of to not have government maintained roads.

AbandonedPorn,3do7xj,bunchajibbajabba,69,Fri Jul 17 23:16:02 2015 UTC,"Updated: Article. Two comments below seem to confirm it. So basically construction started in 2007 and the guy did go to prison for 12 years for bank fraud.  If youtube comments are to be believed it was a Mexican guy that didn't know he had to buy the land to build there (lol):    ""Okay so just did a little research on these houses there are 37 buildings on the property the owner is in federal prison for try to defraud the bank that owns the land. thats why work on them stopped and continuing work is going to be very difficult 4 of the buildings are in a flood plain, the are no roads, no water lines, it is not conected to the power grid and has no power lines, no sewers, the buildings and lot lines don't match up, there was no master development plan, some buildings don't have permits, and the city engineers don't think any of the buildings are up to code. The former owner has a 12 year prison sentence for using fund for the site provided by the bank for personal experiences. So having the homeless live there won't work due to safety issues and quality of living issues, and no one wants to buy the land the happens to be worth a few million. ""    Edit: Fucking youtube comments, now I don't know:    ""I actually live pretty close to hear actually i work for the public transportation company in san antonio and our buses go by there. it was suppose to be new housing develop for the toyota plant close by but toyota has a revolving door and people are constantly laid off. so housing wasn't much of a issue sense there is nothing else around here job wise close to these comes.""    Another:    ""The developer was sent to federal prison for 12 years.  He was trying to defraud the banks and not paying the contractors.  The city shut down the project and it is for sale now.  Here is the link to the news article in the San Antonio newspaper. (http://www.mysanantonio.com/business/article/12-year-sentence-for-developer-1337478.php).

AbandonedPorn,3do7xj,TrickOrTreater,68,Sat Jul 18 02:45:54 2015 UTC,"Zombie paintball park.  Have to watch out for other paintballers, but also people dressed as zombies with a small sack or two of water balloons filled with red paint.  They can't throw them, they can only grab you with the balloon in their hand and it represents a bite. If you're ""bitten"", you're dead.  Headshots can take down zombies(since they're wearing a paintball mask AND a rubber zombie mask, so it's plenty safe).  Holy jesus I want to do this now.  EDIT: You and your group of friends can take turns being players and zombies or you can all be players and can utilize the park’s zombie actors.  Also you’re fitted with a GPS locator as a player so the zombies know where you and the other players are, but you don’t know where the zombies or other players are.  Also, for an equipment fee and a price for compiling/editing footage and burning it onto a DVD, you can attach a GoPro to your paintball helmet while you’re playing and we’d send you your own first person zombie apocalypse movie, with production value and sound effects and music and everything."

AbandonedPorn,3do7xj,TrickOrTreater,8,Sat Jul 18 06:23:45 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. It might make them think twice about going upstairs, but just like your usual paintball park with ""buildings"" there would be multiple unblocked entrances and exists.  Front doors, back doors, garage doors. I think you could successfully maneuver around any zombie(s) that's in your immediate area.  Plus, it just makes it all the more ""real"" and adrenaline-inducing.   Not sure what I'd make the ratio of zombie:player though. Maybe...2 or 3:1 zombie:player. Something like that. Would have to play test a few times though, of course. Find the right balance between varying groups of players and zombies. Enough to make it a challenge but not too much that it's overwhelming and no fun."
AbandonedPorn,3do7xj,tommy4991,3,Sat Jul 18 06:13:19 2015 UTC,"more zombies and a handful of ""survivors"" would be an awesome game. It could be 2 small teams of survivors against each other, maybe instead of capture the flag you can use a med kit as a flag, so its like your fighting for supplies. all this while there is an outnumbering amount of zombie players! and zombies can head towards you if they hear you. so you have to be quick and not stay in one spot to long or the roamers will catch up to you and find you.  Edit: What I mean ""if they hear you""  is the rule ""gun fire only draws more out"" so maybe you can also have rubber knives with paint bags attached to do stealth kills. This way you can also add to the realism by only using the paintball gun when its necessary, not whenever you please."

AbandonedPorn,3do7xj,theunnoanprojec,3,Sat Jul 18 06:31:55 2015 UTC,"My old tall ship friends and i had a game that we would play in port sometimes that was similar to this.  A group of people would be sent out into town as the zombies. The remaining people were the survivors. The survivors each got a few balled up pairs of socks. The survivors had to go around the town looking for 3-5 ""items"" (usually just like buckets or whatever we could find on the boats, but they'd represent food or something like that).    If a human got touched by a zombie, they automatically became a zombie. This is where the socks come on though. You used the socks as a weapon in anyway you could. If a zombie for touched by a sock, they had to stay frozen for 2 minutes, to give the human time to escape.   Once all the items were found, the remaining humans returned to a pre-arranged location (usually on a hill or something), and entered ""final showdown"" mode. If the remaining humans were able to hold off against the zombies for 5 minutes, the humans win. If the zombies manage to turn all the humans Into zombies, the zombies won.  Needless to say a lot of the port towns on the great lakes didn't like us very much after this."
AbandonedPorn,3do7xj,Saucy-Devil,3,Sat Jul 18 08:49:36 2015 UTC,"The reason head shots are discouraged in paintball is because while the masks can take it, you are supposed to replace the lens if it gets hit a few times, and they can be rather pricey (~$25) if you have a decent mask."

There is an old motel that I've watched falling into the ground for the past 40 years that I'd love to take pictures of. It's the signs posted at the edges of the property that keep me away.

AbandonedPorn,3ddrw2,HellonStilts,41,Thu Jul 16 08:27:05 2015 UTC,"another failed building project from Brazil. Abandoned in the 1970's. As though it was miraculously transported from a more urban area, the abandoned Viaduct Petrobras rises out of the lush South American jungle, a testament to mismanaged government spending.  Construction on the Rio-Santos Highway began in the 1960s and by 1976 the stretch of road was due to be linked to the existing highway. However, the plans were altered at the last minute so that the existing road was linked to a coastal route and the newly constructed, but never used viaduct was simply abandoned. Over 40 meters tall and 300 meters long, the elevated roadway features tunnels, retaining walls, and a massive concrete foundation all being slowly taken over by the surrounding greenery.   While the abandoned civic project seemed wasteful at the time, it is now a popular tourist attraction for travelers looking to do some rappelling and bungee jumping. The abandoned Viaduct Petrobras can be accessed from the Salesopolis Caragua neighborhood in Porto Novo via a thin country road, but the structure must be approached on foot or motorbike for the final stretch.

AbandonedPorn,3ddrw2,Zbignich,68,Wed Jul 15 16:33:12 2015 UTC,"That is exactly what it is.  The plan was to have a high-speed highway connecting Rio to Santos (the port city near São Paulo). Currently, the road runs through most of the beach towns and cities. This was part of a major project to have the northern and southern portions of highway BR-101 connected. That is the major coastal highway, but it doesn't exist between Rio and Paraná state, passing through São Paulo state where this elevated highway portion is. In that area, only BR-116 exists.  Some bridges were built, and some columns were built, but the road was never completed.  There is a post on Skyscrapercity in Portuguese about this viaduct and a few other portions that would have been part of the BR-101 connection but were abandoned. There are more photos in the post. http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=557899"
AbandonedPorn,3ddrw2,thearchduke,19,Wed Jul 15 16:46:42 2015 UTC,You seem pretty knowledgeable about the area - do you have any insight as to why this area is developed so bizarrely?
AbandonedPorn,3ddrw2,Zbignich,19,Wed Jul 15 19:45:53 2015 UTC,This was probably a single property that is sold to a speculative developer. It could have been a farm or just unused land. This area is called Morada da Praia (Beach Home). Land is sold to middle-class purchasers that build their own house according to the condo rules. Lots closer to the ocean have much higher prices. I found some information stating that the area was developed starting in 1981.

AbandonedPorn,3ddrw2,spectre73,24,Wed Jul 15 15:49:32 2015 UTC,Probably two different contractors for the road and the bridge. Bridge team finished and then the project probably got abandoned before the road was completed. No sense in tearing down a perfectly good bridge!

AbandonedPorn,3dai36,MechanicalTurkish,7,Wed Jul 15 03:20:44 2015 UTC,"In many mental hospitals, the procedure during a fire is to bring the patients to a different portion of the building, rather than taking them outside."
AbandonedPorn,3dai36,Rain12913,2,Wed Jul 15 06:59:18 2015 UTC,That seems... unsafe.
AbandonedPorn,3dai36,MechanicalTurkish,4,Wed Jul 15 11:47:40 2015 UTC,"Remember that these are people who have lost their legal right to live independently because they have been determined to be too much of a risk to their own safety (and/or the safety of others).  For these people to be outside is a huge risk that has a relatively high chance of resulting in harm or death.  I'm not talking about people in residential or day programs, but people in acute, locked, inpatient units.  There is actually a control system that manages the process I described above.  The way it works is that the building is divided into different quadrants, so when a fire is detected the system figures out which quadrant the alarm has been triggered in.  It then determines the safest portion of the building, and that is communicated to hospital staff so patients can be moved there.  The area they're moved to is of course near an actual exit, so that if the particular quadrant were to no longer be safe then the patients would be moved outside as a last resort."

Propane stove, louvered windows, roof doors that opened up wide, and even split windshields that opened up about three inches at the bottom. I loved that old beast.   Kinda slow, semis would pass me going up steep grades. If I had a good tail wind I could make it all the way to 65 going downhill. San Diego to Humboldt and back three or four times. It was a good time."

Most people nowadays work their 9-5 job, like it or not but are used to go home in the evening and get up in the morning, have their friends and their family, their computer and their phone and it's all basically their little warm fuzzy shell.   It is still really cheap to live in some countries in Eastern Europe or in the Orient, hell even Spain or Portugal (I was there this week). But it's very much the desire to actually go on such an adventure..   I personally own an old VW bus (T25) and do as many (road) trips as I can afford, and most people (friends or strangers) say stuff like ""woah so cool man I wish I could do the same"", ""oh you've been so many places"", ""it's the best blabla"" when they see my van..and I'm like.. you can dude.. if you really want to.. life is short, make the most out of it."

They can, and it's so true that is too short to miss the cool stuff because everybody says you can't. It isn't something you want to spend your whole life doing, but that time when you're young and can just say fuck it, I'm going to do this. Just cuz.   Now I'm an old fart and I realize that so many of the crazy shit I got into when I was younger was really pretty cool. I didn't do it to be cool at all. Never thought of it that way.

People go at eachother throats for one under $10,000. No matter if there's rust or no engine.   I wouldn't imagine they're much cheaper in the US. Only place they're affordable is remote locations in Eastern Europe, or Brazil or South America in general, because they produced the ""same"" version until 2012 or 2013. So they have tons of it.     Yeah it's kind of cool but it's kind of sad too, considering the value and style that comes along with driving one in 2015.   Obviously you wouldn't have known this in 1970 haha."

AbandonedPorn,3cslrq,main_enigma,44,Sat Jul 11 04:12:20 2015 UTC,"The current economy is the strongest one in history. Before that (and Gloria's), no one could've beaten the economy under Magsaysay. Average growth under Marcos (1966-1986) was only 2% (Some sources say 1.4% others say 1.7%) not to mention the recessions in the mid 1980s. For comparison, growth under Gloria average 4.5% and under PNoy is 6%. Growth halted in Mindanao because the muslim insurgency started due to his terrible, incompetent leadership.   His priority was political stability under military dictatorship so he fed the pockets of the military, creating the military elite, and his political allies, making sure oligarchs stayed loyal to him. He was solely responsible for the politicization of the military and the police which includes figures like Enrile, Honasan and Purisima. This created corruption in the military. Wealth was concentrated under the friends of Marcos and the military. Maintaining the military was a drain on the economy. Corruption was rampant as hell.   More than 50% of Filipinos lived under poverty during the terror that is Marcos. Nowadays 25% are below poverty line. Marcos also borrowed a lot of money, using it on useless buildings that serve no value other than appeasing his crazy wife instead on infrastructure. A lot of Filipinos are unemployed under him, but what's worse is underemployment which tripled in his reign. The currency utterly devalued under his reign. Income inequality was the highest on record then, 60% of the poorest contributed 20% in the economy while 10% of the richest contributed 40%. Workers' wages decreased drastically, averaging -5% annually under him.   Before his reign, the Philippines was one of the most well-fed in Asia, under Marcos 40% of the nation's deaths was caused by malnutrition. It was under his reign that the rice sufficiency problem was exacerbated. He had no real agenda for agrarian reform. Farmers continuously rose up and demanded that they own the land that they were working on, Marcos only suppressed them.  It is estimated that he stole 30 billion dollars from the economy.  Please stop spreading the awful lie that the Philippines was greatest under Marcos. It's simply false propaganda by his lackeys.   Note: Continuously editing for Fact-checking"

AbandonedPorn,3cslrq,tidbitsz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:31:38 2015 UTC,"President Ferdinand Marcos’ dream of building a new society had brought forth several projects that have benefited us in the long run. During his third SONA in 1968, Marcos claimed that the country became self-sufficient in rice and corn, therefore solving the chronic food shortage. Fast forward to 1980 and the Marcos administration reached yet another milestone: The country’s gross national product (GNP) dramatically climbed from 39.5 billion pesos in 1965 to an outstanding 86.7 billion pesos in 1979, which translates to 6.6% growth rate a year. the peso also becam a powerful currency almost equalling the dollar 1 to 1 And this was only the tip of the iceberg. From Sept. 21, 1972 up to Feb. 26, 1986, Marcos was able to craft and formulate a total of 7,883 presidential decrees and other 5 legal issuances. All of the country’s specialty hospitals were also built during his term and these include the Kidney Center, Philippine Children Center, Philippine Heart Center, and the Lung Center of the Philippines. Marcos’ accomplishments are too many to mention, and have since become the benchmark by which the performances of his successors are based upon.  you want to talk about theft? what has any of the other presidents done with the wealth they stole? nothing.  if you are blaming marcos for the rebellion, you are very missinformed, he did not spark the revolution by having ninoy assassinated, he actually wanted him to be his successor.  crime rate was the lowest in history ever during his reign. drugs and alcohol were off the streets.  it seems like you know nothing of the history of his reign and know nothing about marcos at all and just riding the ""he was a horrible dictator"" bandwagon  look at the philippines right now, it was all downhill after marcos  the country was in its prime when he was the president  he may have abused his power, but it was what the country needed, filipino people have no discipline, they demand freedom but abuse it and do nothing but blame the government of the shithole state the country is in now, marcos used his power to put the filipinos in line, he may have used fear, but it worked. if you watch philippine news now, crime is just getting worse and worse, filipinos are not afraid of the government anymore and they disrespect their country. god damn they cant even stop throwing garbage on the street and every vacant lot."
AbandonedPorn,3cslrq,nebuchadrezzar,2,Sun Jul 12 04:28:45 2015 UTC,"Where are you getting all this?  You  mention projects like the coconut palace as a positive instead of the embarrassments they really are.  As for the rest, I have no idea where you get your info   To begin with, poverty significantly worsened during the Marcos years. “A World Bank study estimated that the proportion of people living below the poverty line in [Phl] cities had risen from 24 percent in 1974 to 40 percent in 1986 [the year Marcos was ousted]. The countryside was no better.” Thus wrote the well-respected journalist and historian Stanley Karnow in his book, In Our Image, America’s Empire in the Philippines, which won the Pulitzer Prize for History.    Workers’ wages decreased drastically. Between 1982 and 1986, real wages of unskilled laborers in Metropolitan Manila declined annually at 5.8 percent, and those of skilled laborers at 5.2 percent. Agricultural wages also declined at the same rate, according to James K. Boyce, associate professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts in his book, The Political Economy of Growth and Impoverishment in the Marcos Era. But the rich got richer. In his book, The Marcos File, Charles C. McDougald reported that in 1980 the top 12.9 percent of the Filipino population received 22.1 percent of total income, while the bottom 11 percent just received 16.6 percent. In 1983, the top 12.9 percent now received 45.5 percent of total income, while the bottom 11 percent received only 6.4 percent. The poor got poorer. Public debt soared. The peso-dollar official exchange rate was P3.90 to the dollar in 1966 when Marcos became president. It fell to P20.53 to the dollar in 1986. The Philippines’ foreign debt rose from $360 million in 1962 to $28.3 billion in 1986, said Boyce. Hence, more than one-half of the present $53 billion external debt was contributed by Marcos. It is now helping cost our government more than 40 percent of its budget in debt service, forcing the Aquino II administration to cut budgetary allocations for essential services, like education, health and infrastructure.  The insurgency intensified. “. . . [T]he US foreign policy experts also perceived that the longer Marcos’ excesses continue, the faster the Communist insurgency would spread . . . So his profligacy, corruption and repression presented a potential danger to America’s strategic interests,” said Karnow. Not only did the Communist insurgency strengthen, the Muslim insurgency erupted and after protracted war forced the Marcos government to sign the humiliating Tripoli Agreement giving concessions to the Moro National Liberation Front."

AbandonedPorn,3co2xd,rareas,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:58:17 2015 UTC,"If you put the drywall on the walls first, you can't actually get the ceiling drywall into all the corners of the ceiling as you can't access it anymore. Whereas if you do the ceiling, you can completely ""tile"" the ceiling with drywall, all the way to all the edges, then you can put the wall drywall up tight against that, which helps hold it from sagging and gets you a nice clean edge.  Also, there is special ceiling drywall which is stiffer. Keep an eye on your contractor if you are having whole rooms done. That's a common mistake too."

The rail bridge had a road built literally on top of it. That road was later replaced with the modern bridge seen on the right, and this bridge had since been abandoned.

AbandonedPorn,3ch1zn,Hutnick,-3,Wed Jul 8 12:27:44 2015 UTC,"The [rich] got the same lousy process    I disagree completely, & here's an example.    Consider a rich man & a poor man both make accusations that a police officer assaulted them & lied about it.  Immediately, the rich man has a team of lawyers who initiate legal proceedings against the officer.   The rich man doesn't have to say a word, but a bunch of lawyers do it for him. It's probably a public trial, plus hopefully a fairly independent person writing down everything that's said.  So it's harder for the opposition (the state) to accuse the man of saying a bunch of things they just made up.   Now compare a very poor man, he lost his job & is trying to escape homelessness.  He makes the same allegations- the police assaulted him, lied, etc.     The police (knowing he has no legal power) simply tell psychiatrists their ""story"" & they (possibly the same policeman who allegedly assaulted him) violently kidnap the man, taking him into a psychiatric prison.   The end.  There's no team of lawyers, no public trial.  No lawyer at all.  The man may not even be told what he was accused of."
AbandonedPorn,3ch1zn,anticapitalist,3,Wed Jul 8 15:21:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a social worker at a public defense agency. That is simply not true. Psychiatric institutions of the Cuckoo's Nest kind simply don't exist today. In my state—most other states follow similar protocols—a patient can't be held involuntarily at all unless a staff physician believes that s/he is in danger or putting others in danger, and can't be held for more than 72 hours unless two physicians certify that it's necessary. After this, a patient can't be held for more than 60 days without a court hearing.  It's not the sixties anymore. Being held involuntarily is uncommon. Being held involuntarily for more than 72 hours is incredibly rare. Hospitals simply don't have the resources to house and treat people with mental illness for extended periods of time. They don't even have the resources to provide inpatient treatment to people who want treatment, let alone people who don't want to be there. Even people who are dangerously psychotic end up getting medicated and sent home.  EDIT: Anyone read that NY Times article about how hard it is to get someone involuntarily treated for mental illness? If not, it's worth checking out.   When I asked Davison for specific examples [of people who were not eligible for involuntary psychiatric commitment], he rattled several off the top of his head. A man who was convinced that aliens were on the roof and that bugs were coming out of the walls and who would not sit on furniture but only lie on the floor was not committable. Neither was the man who refused medication and mutilated his own testicles. Nor the woman who wouldn’t eat because she believed the C.I.A. was trying to poison her. “It is unbelievable the condition of people who are found not to meet the standard,” Davison says."
AbandonedPorn,3ch1zn,not_a_big_fan_of_GOT,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:10:12 2015 UTC,"Psychiatric institutions of the Cuckoo's Nest kind simply don't exist today.     I didn't say they were 100% identical.   I said people can be imprisoned for life (which is murder to honest people) without any evidence/conviction of a crime.   I said a person can be imprisoned for life because a psychiatrist believe (via subjective opinion) that they are ""potentially dangerous.""  That could be almost anyone, depending on the views of the violent attacker/psychiatrist.  From the perspective of victims (ie people violently tortured by psychiatrists) it's psychiatrists who are the ones who are dangerous.  ie, the issue isn't that ""someone is potentially dangerous"" (which is subjective)-- the issue is who has the violent power to remove other people's human rights & destroy/torture them, and who does it.  That's modern psychiatry.  And the major reason it happens less is it's not funded as much as previously.  If they had the profit incentive to imprison/murder millions more than they do now, I believe they would.    Anyone read that NY Times article about how hard it is to get someone involuntarily treated for mental illness?   Just mentioning the NYT making assertions is not an argument.  Newspapers have been wrong many times.  You above admitted that all it takes is psychiatrists claiming a person is potentially dangerous.    "" unless a staff physician believes that s/he is in danger or putting others in danger,""  Technically two, but that is irrelevant- they are co-workers who will practically always ""agree"" with each other.  That is not evidence/conviction of any crime.   That is torturing the innocent & the poor.   . A man who was convinced that aliens    Allegations made without due process- irrelevant.  If the man had a lawyer & was told what he was accused of saying, he'd very possibly deny it all.   Neither was the man who refused medication and mutilated his own testicles.     More allegations with no evidence. There's no ""medication""- ""mental illness"" is just a label/construct for alleged behaviors, not a real/physical illness. And thus the drugs people use are not medication, but just drugs.

That's propaganda:    Really when there's:   more people than jobs  and almost all land is owned by the wealthy   You'd get homelessness even if everyone was Einstein.  It's a violent system to create homelessness- such is the main punishment for refusing labor exploitation by the capitalist class.  (If you can even find it.)   so many mentally ill people now end up homeless.   Actually, a ""mental illness"" is just a label for alleged behaviors/feelings, not a real/physical illness.  Thomas Insel:   “DSM diagnoses are based on a consensus about clusters of clinical symptoms, not any objective laboratory measure.”   -- Thomas Insel (Director of the NIMH) @ psychologytoday.com        Allen Frances:    ""Mental disorders don't really live ‘out there’ waiting to be explained. They are constructs we have made up - and often not very compelling ones.""   -- Allen Frances, DSM-IV chief in “DSM in Philosophyland: Curiouser and Curiouser” in AAP&P Bulletin vol 17, No 2 of 2010     Allen Frances:    ""psychiatric diagnosis still relies exclusively on fallible subjective judgments rather than objective biological tests""   -- Allen Frances, 2013  Basically, you are just using the ancient religion myth of ""insanity.""

AbandonedPorn,3ch1zn,anticapitalist,4,Thu Jul 9 06:53:41 2015 UTC,"so many mentally ill people now end up homeless.   That's propaganda   ""Approximately 200,000 individuals with schizophrenia or manic-depressive illness are homeless, constituting one-third of the approximately 600,000 homeless population"" source   Actually, a ""mental illness"" is just a label for alleged behaviors/feelings, not a real/physical illness.   1) Behaviors have a physiological basis, the brain.  2) I assure you that psychological maladies are real. I witnessed a friend have a schizophrenic break; he went from someone with the most promising future ahead of him to someone who spends his day ""thinking about colors."" He is now unable to maintain relationships or care for himself. This behavior is the manifestation of someone who broke. It is real.  Your criticism if the DSM is right and valid, I am pleased that we are moving towards a more physiological view of diagnosing and treating mental health, however this does not mean that mental illness isn't a serious problem that needs addressing. Just because the DSM sucks for diagnoses does not mean that mental illness is imaginary, and psychological problems are not merely some tool invented by the man used to keep people down. Some people need help and cannot care for themselves. To be dismissive of this fact I find to be grossly misanthropic.   Basically, you are just using the ancient religion myth of ""insanity."" You are assuming the victims of state violence are to blame. You don't blame the powerful, but the weak.   You're wrong, insanity (by whatever name) is a real thing and people can and do break mentally. I've seen it. Mental illness is a physiological issue made manifest through behavior. It exists independently of social constructs and deserves our attention and compassion."

Others prefer to think of their problems as, for example, an aspect of their personality which sometimes gets them into trouble but which they would not want to be without.”       The report adds that antipsychotic medications are sometimes helpful, but that “there is no evidence that it corrects an underlying biological abnormality.” It then warns about the risk of taking these drugs for years.       -- http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/18/opinion/sunday/t-m-luhrmann-redefining-mental-illness.html   Behaviors have a physiological basis, the brain.

AbandonedPorn,3canc0,mgsblade,40,Mon Jul 6 12:30:23 2015 UTC,"Was the land more fertile back then, or did people just like to make things difficult for themselves?"
AbandonedPorn,3canc0,exoxe,57,Mon Jul 6 17:52:48 2015 UTC,"Actually, most parts of northern africa were way more fertile. It was the empires ""granary"" - the largest amount of wheat they needed in italy and central europe came from africa, kyrenaika and mauretania - some portions from palestina judaea. So it would be safe to assume that Syria was more fertile too. Nevertheless they mainly exported wool, glass and other primary non-nutritional resources - such as wood. And fancy religions (Mithraism, hooray! They were, along with Judaea, the closest province to the Parthian Empire, which emerged from local empires, remains of the babylonian empire and smaller principalities that were formed by Alexanders former generals)  Climate conditions were quite ideal at the time. It's known as the ""roman warm period"" or ""roman climatic optimum"" - which in modern historiography is seen as one of the main factors for the rise of the roman empire (and - kind of - its decline).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Warm_Period"
AbandonedPorn,3canc0,megasthenes,9,Mon Jul 6 18:17:27 2015 UTC,"Theophrastus (371 – c. 287 BC) wrote that date trees could grow in Greece if planted, but could not set fruit there. This is the same situation as today, and suggests that southern Aegean mean summer temperatures in the fourth and fifth centuries BC were within a degree of modern temperatures. This and other literary fragments from the time confirm that the Greek climate during that period was basically the same as it was around 2000 AD.   So if I am reading right, simply being a warm period doesn't really suggest syria, etc, were more fertile than todays standard - IF wikipedia is to be trusted here."
AbandonedPorn,3canc0,Jahkral,7,Mon Jul 6 20:46:07 2015 UTC,"Your argument is true - but what we need is information from a time when syria actually was part of the roman empire, which was not until  63BC, so at least ~220 years after Theophrastus, which is quite a lot.  The one argument that stands is that they mainly exported wool, linen and pottery, as well as other primary resources but also wine, olive oil, cedar wood and other goods. Also they were kinda important to the empire as the largest eastern province that was surrounded by ""client-kingdoms"" and later bordered Parthia directly - thus the large presence of the military (4 legions in the early principate!) and because of its location at the end of the silk road.  Things changed after the first Jewish War and the Bar Kokhba Revolt in the bordering Judaea when it was (re-)merged to Syria Palaestina and later even was divided into three parts. At that point - around 135-350 and later it was depopulated in large areas.  It seems that they weren't much more fertile than now, but definitely more than what Theophrastus describes - as they obviously were able to set fruit and use it economically. I'm not sure but Pliny might have reflected that somewhere in his ""naturalis historia""."
AbandonedPorn,3canc0,megasthenes,3,Mon Jul 6 21:45:18 2015 UTC,"In terms of this particular castle no, they relied on the highway that ran from the southern seaport all the way up to a major city in Syria named Bosra. they also relied on the masterful water infrastructure that the previous desert Nabataean kingdom( builders of petra) had set up,the reservoir you see in the foreground was constructed by them a century or two prior to the castle.  also dont forget that at its peak, the castle would have been surrounded by a small settlement as well as have traffic passing by it all the time."

AbandonedPorn,3c7hi8,Type-21,8,Sun Jul 5 19:43:26 2015 UTC,Sure. All aircraft that are in the air right now started off as a smaller wind tunnel model. Often made out of wood because you're doing the wind tunnel tests so early in the development process that you don't have a lot of funding yet and wood is cheap. Many ideas are scrapped after the first wind tunnel test that's why you don't want to waste money on a potential fail. Also with wood it's so much simpler to modify the design and test again. Today they mostly use computers to simulate the early development stages though. Less risk of losing money

The trouble with squatting in tower blocks is that they can house a high population, do you always end up with some wrong 'uns. It's difficult to keep a particular area secure, and you end up with communal areas - the main door and stairwells, if nothing else. Once some schizophrenic starts shitting in the corners or eats your dog, then good view is no longer enough.   It's not so bad if you're with a large group of friends, but even so can be hard work."
AbandonedPorn,3c2lde,ButterflyAttack,27,Sat Jul 4 12:07:55 2015 UTC,Sounds like you've got many a story to tell...
AbandonedPorn,3c2lde,dakial,32,Sat Jul 4 13:06:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess so - but many people who do urban exploration probably have better ones.   For about twenty years, I've lived in squats or in vehicles on squatted land. Generally, the more abandoned a place is, the longer you can stay there before eviction and the lead likely you are to be causing bother for anyone else. Some of the more fucked buildings have needed a lot of repairs, but it's good to be able to leave a place in better condition than you find it. I'm happy with the place I'm living now - it's right in the centre of a big city, has an abandoned tower block on - though not as big as the great block in this thread! - and it'd been empty for twenty years before we arrived ten years ago. We live in trucks and caravans in the yard around it and have managed to get the place quite nice with a lot of gardening work. We don't (usually) go in the tower block, at the owners request."
AbandonedPorn,3c2lde,ButterflyAttack,8,Sat Jul 4 13:39:21 2015 UTC,Do you know why the owner kept the place empty for 20 years? Doesn't seem like a smart move
AbandonedPorn,3c2lde,Fortiman,22,Sat Jul 4 14:26:49 2015 UTC,"The land is apparently contaminated, and the frontings of the buildings are protected as being historical. I think it'd cost quite a lot to develop the site, so, AFAIK, they've just been using it as collateral on loans.   There's a planning app probably going through soon, though we might have to move before long. . ."
AbandonedPorn,3c2lde,ButterflyAttack,6,Sat Jul 4 14:32:32 2015 UTC,"It's really cool that you maintain the area and the gardens.  If you don't mind me asking,  what made you start to squat in the first place?"
AbandonedPorn,3c2lde,JDH1234,8,Sat Jul 4 16:18:51 2015 UTC,"I started over twenty years ago, when I was quite an activist. I've always tried to live low-impact. I like community living. And the housing market here in the UK isn't great - either you spend your working life in debt to a bank or to pay rent to someone else and with no housing security. It's getting harder to squat here, these days - housing costs mean that there are fewer abandoned buildings that require anything less than major work to be habitable, and laws have changed, the government don't like people taking a DIY approach to housing! I'm not getting any younger, so I don't know how long I'll keep squatting - I'm looking at alternatives, maybe saving up and getting a boat. . ."

Never mind that nothing bad is happening to people living in it's shadow (I do). I did a report on nuclear energy in elementary school (90s) and was met with resistance.

AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,dubblix,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:55:35 2015 UTC,"Sure, it's safe now--I actually don't disagree.  But what makes it safe is expensive shielding.

AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,JohnnyMnemo,7,Wed Jul 8 05:32:46 2015 UTC,"I don't often hear people saying ""they don't make em like they used to"" for windows."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,KilowogTrout,7,Thu Jul 2 03:59:15 2015 UTC,"Actually even modern glass doesn't insulate very well, better, but not by much. The only insulation is the value of the vacuum between the panes, which old glass doesn't have. But as long as nothing is broken and everything is properly sealed, the windows are alright.  Edit: A lot of folks are trying to argue about new windows, but are missing the point. Yes, new windows are more efficient, but not by enough to warrant replacement so long as the envelope is still intact. The u value difference of new versus old windows is not enough to warrant replacement on the simple grounds of increased efficiency. Windows are expensive. Replacing old windows in a private home typically carries a 30-40 year simple roi. You factor in those massive panels an airport would have and you're looking at a half a century roi. That's not reasonable.  Sure new windows are better, they limit hear transfer and can block out noise and light, but they aren't better enough to warrant replacement unless there's actually something wrong with them."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,TheDude-Esquire,17,Thu Jul 2 00:58:32 2015 UTC,"There is not a vacuum between panes of modern windows. It's usually argon, or another inert gas with insulating properties better than air."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,LanceMurdock,0,Thu Jul 2 01:23:49 2015 UTC,better than no air
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,adamdangerfield,3,Thu Jul 2 07:57:58 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of the total window assemblies U value ( thermal heat loss value) and the solar heat gain coefficient(SHGC) applied to the glass. SHGC is the rating of how much solar heat the glass transmits and/it absorbs.   These advances make Windows ""better"" today than they used to be."

AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,KilowogTrout,2,Thu Jul 2 01:11:13 2015 UTC,Why? Flying sucks. It's not a luxury these days and you should be comfy.   Just because it was a luxury 50 years ago doesn't mean we should treat it as such today. It's a means from pout A to point B. That's about it.

AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,extra_less,0,Thu Jul 2 16:12:37 2015 UTC,Would you wear your PJ's to the mall?
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,FesteringNeonDistrac,3,Thu Jul 2 04:18:43 2015 UTC,Is Amazon the mall?
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,KilowogTrout,7,Thu Jul 2 15:22:32 2015 UTC,"Well I certainly don't dress up for the mall. I'm comfortable. But the mall isn't a means to another location, you go there looking for something, and sometimes you go to the mall for something to do.   If you're flying, you're either paying thousands of dollars to learn or you've spent thousands and enjoy flying or you're going somewhere.   Very different experiences."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,KilowogTrout,2,Thu Jul 2 04:42:58 2015 UTC,Doubt that it would ever happen. I just wear whatever I'm wearing to the mall.
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,KilowogTrout,3,Thu Jul 2 16:13:40 2015 UTC,What's in it for me if I answer?
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,raggedtoad,57,Thu Jul 2 18:35:40 2015 UTC,"Well, flying used to be affordable and/or available to the top 5% of the population. These days, ticket prices have dropped to the point where flying is an affordable (if not completely cheap) mode of transit for almost everyone.  Basically, back when flying was ""classy"", it was because all of the riffraff were stuck suffering on non-air conditioned Greyhound buses for days. Now those same folks are farting and snoring in the seat next to you."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,EddiePsgetti,8,Thu Jul 2 20:23:39 2015 UTC,My wife had a similar thought. It was prestigious to fly but then got cheap enough for everyone to do it.
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,megamoze,12,Thu Jul 2 21:45:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that space is beautiful but it's impractical for today's traveling public.  I can barely find a place to sit in a modern terminal, let alone some place like this, which would be pretty much SRO."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,duckliondog,9,Thu Jul 2 21:47:55 2015 UTC,"Not entirely. Deregulation meant that price became the #1 differentiating factor for consumers, whereas previously, the big carriers had to compete on amenities and service. Flying was affordable and classy for normal people before deregulation as long as they weren't going too far. More people fly now, and inflation-adjusted comparisons show that it is much cheaper to do so, but it's more due to a race to the bottom than some technological leap. Before deregulation, middle class people could enjoy a top notch travel experience. Now, everyone feels like they're at the bus depot."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,JDRaitt,4,Thu Jul 2 00:22:13 2015 UTC,Was it deregulation or competition that did this? What were the regulations keeping prices high?
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,duckliondog,0,Thu Jul 2 00:32:50 2015 UTC,"The regulations were just barriers to entry for new airlines and rules for expansions by existing ones. Deregulation allowed new airlines to enter the market, driving prices down and removing the profit margins that made terminals like this possible."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,rebelheart,2,Thu Jul 2 00:30:18 2015 UTC,"It's the same with every new technology. It's a plaything for the rich first until later everyone can afford it. The telephone, the automobile, the internet."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,KilowogTrout,-2,Thu Jul 2 10:09:44 2015 UTC,"No, it's not that the lower classes can afford it, it's that it's cheap enough for most folks to use it as a first option. Fuck flying in your Sunday best, it's a god damn means to point B. Be comfy and enjoy your destination."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,Freddy216b,11,Thu Jul 2 11:35:08 2015 UTC,"I am no where near old enough to have experience that age of flight but I wish I had. I get excited to fly and love every minute of it. It bothers me that people treat flying as waste of time where they may as well get comfortable and pass out so they don't have endure the time it takes. People take for granted that without flight, a lot of trips would take days, not hours. I just love the engineering that goes into those big birds and all the logistics on the ground to make sure they get you to you destination as quickly, efficiently, and safely as possible. I need to fly more."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,doublefudgebrownies,21,Thu Jul 2 18:10:21 2015 UTC,Seats were a whole lot bigger then.
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,CrazyCarl1986,14,Thu Jul 2 11:06:51 2015 UTC,People were smaller too.
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,Lothar_Ecklord,9,Thu Jul 2 03:56:54 2015 UTC,"Going on vacation in the fall.. Obviously, the destination is a huge part of it, but I myself am really looking forward to the flight as well. I booked early and got a window seat, away from the wing - no obstructions. I even planned it so I am on the side with the better view 😃"
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,SpaceCaseSixtyTen,8,Wed Jul 1 23:20:20 2015 UTC,"I can spend the entire time looking out the window on a flight till my neck hurts like hell, just listening to tunes and sipping on a double whiskey on the rocks (or an edible eaten beforehand for extra spacewow experience)... make sure to bring good polarized sunglasses! One time I forgot and it was sooo damn bright, my eyes could barely get used to it and when I would look away from the window on the plane everything was so dark I couldn't see anything."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,mgearliosus,4,Thu Jul 2 00:04:24 2015 UTC,Make sure it's not a windowless window seat.
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,AustinRiversDaGod,5,Thu Jul 2 01:21:10 2015 UTC,"Damn. I love window seats where I can see the wing, particularly the back of the wing so I can see the flaps and the engines."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,Lothar_Ecklord,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:39:22 2015 UTC,"True. I do love watching the surface controls too, but every time I've ever flown, I either don't get a window, or I do but there is a wing in the way... Figured I'd try an unobstructed view of the ground this time"
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,blooregard325i,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:55:42 2015 UTC,"I still find it exciting and fun.  However, when you have a 15 hour flight ahead of you, getting comfortable is 100% essential.  Exactly as you say, it could take days or weeks by ship to get places.  And even then, I know I would want to be comfortable while admiring the huge engines and inner workings of an ocean liner."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,Drewsipher,2,Thu Jul 2 05:17:35 2015 UTC,I think it is amazing that flight is now a norm. It is nice to have the nostalgia for the pomp and circumstance but it is a million times better this way!
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,daonejorge,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:31:02 2015 UTC,I would definitely argue that flying now days is significantly more integral to our society than it has ever been before.

It's only when I started flying the Asian carriers did I realized what absolute trash the US domestic carriers are.

AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,Pro-Zak,10,Thu Jul 2 00:36:06 2015 UTC,"I seriously wish that the rights to TWA wasn't in the hand of American Airlines, I would pour my life into restoring that company.  My grandfather was an avid pilot, during the war he was part of the Army Air Corps and taught pilots how to fly and gained control of a runway after WW2.  The runway was called Fairfield-Suisun Air Park out of Fairfield, California.  When he was alive he went on and on about how much of his heart and soul went into flying and the love he had for it.   He continued on after the war with that airport for a little bit till the late 50's then started flying with TWA and ended up retiring in October of 1983 with them.  As a kid my dad would hang around the airport a lot and just take random flights to see the world, if TWA flew there, he's been there.  Heck, he even said that after school he would just book the earliest flight possible and just do his homework on the way, chill out at wherever he went and take another flight back home. Also, when my grandparents were both out of town on business, he would just pick a flight that had meals and just eat that instead of going to a restaurant.  I sadly never got to fly with them while they were still in business but the praise my father has given TWA over the years is very high. The hospitality, stewardess's, service, food, everything was great. Something from my fathers point of view, has never been matched yet.   Corrections and additions are in bold."

I used to think that this was a terrible fate for any building of historic significance, but then I had a chance to go visit the Customs Tower in Boston. Mariot had turned it into a hotel (amazingly) and they did an awesome job preserving it's beauty, (even housing a mini-museum in the two-story lobby), and true to their word to the city (a rare thing in Boston) they have the observation deck open to the public ~2PM. Best view of the city, because it's open-air and not clogged with finger-grime-covered windows like on the Prudential.  So a hotel here would be awesome- what harm could they do to it? It keeps the space around, keeps it profitable, and preserves a significant part of airline history."

AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,Flexremmington,8,Thu Jul 2 14:43:21 2015 UTC,"I worked in JFK for a summer, and spent a lot of time there (especially in line).   Photos can't do it justice. The spaces are all fluid - one space leads to another - and (from what I remember) the ceiling heights through much of the building are very low. The ticket counters are in tube-like spaces (dark with low ceilings). As you leave the ticket counter and walk into the center lobby, you suddenly find yourself in a larger and grander, well-lit space - the contrast with the tubular spaces makes the lobby seem larger than it really is. However, the entire terminal is very small, and it is hard to believe that it was ever functional."

AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,photolouis,4,Wed Jul 1 23:39:08 2015 UTC,They did. Jet Blue built a bigger terminal behind that one. That particular terminal would be difficult to adapt to modern air travel.

AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,acepiloto,5,Thu Jul 2 01:24:27 2015 UTC,"Their assets weren't left lying around, American Airlines bought TWA out. The older planes got sold or scrapped while the rest were absorbed into the AA fleet. TWA pilots began to fly for AA, and from what I've heard, they were incredibly bitter about the whole thing. AA inherited TWA's hubs and downsized some redundant ones."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,Stormdancer,5,Thu Jul 2 02:31:28 2015 UTC,"A lot of TWA employees got fucked in that deal. My mom was 2 months away from being able to take early retirement when she got canned. She had to interview for her own job, and basically got looked over because she didn't have a degree, despite that she had many accolades in her job performance. I know takeovers can get nasty, but that just seemed a bit too personal."
AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,uggmun,2,Thu Jul 2 02:48:48 2015 UTC,She probably actually got canned because she was 2 months from being able to retire. That way they didn't have to pay her benefits.   Fuckers.

AbandonedPorn,3bsb7i,thelonious_bunk,2,Thu Jul 2 13:51:00 2015 UTC,"And the pilots who did transfer over were very dissatisfied with the way things were done at American. For instance, the flight bidding system at American was thought to be inferior to the one at TWA. It's a shame because TWA and Pan Am used to be the most famous airlines in the US. Both airlines, along with other classics like Braniff and Eastern, couldn't compete in the post-deregulation market and died out.   On the bright side, another Eastern Airlines is starting up. They only fly charter flights now but they expect to have more planes and start scheduled service by next year. The People Express startup was a huge flop, which isn't a surprise because the airline was handled so poorly. There's been so many failed Pan Am startups I lost count. Unfortunately, nobody seems to want to restart the TWA brand."

It was all this way out controversial art like 20 naked black females chained together, and people skateboarding up and down the walls, um.. you know.. Art.  I guess opening night was more of a drunken kegger then a gallery opening where they totally trashed the place.  When the airport saw what they had done, they locked them out and closed the show the next day.  I wish I could find the video, it was like watching a slow motion trainwreck of repulsive trust-fund ""art"" snobs."

Geils Band, Joe Walsh, Among the locals, the MC5, the Stooges, and Bob Seger. Ted Nugent and The Amboy Dukes recorded their live album “Survival of the Fittest” here. Drugs were commonplace at the theater, with craziness unfolding every night. The theater became a haven for huge raves and parties in the 1990s and has switched hands a few times since then. In 2010 a fire burnt out part of the theater and the apartments above/next to it. Since then it has been in despair. Scrappers recently stole the beams holding up the roof, and the entire thing came down a few weeks later. It sits in castrophia in one of the most dangerous parts of Detroit.

AbandonedPorn,3bl8se,nemyhlol,19,Tue Jun 30 03:20:03 2015 UTC,"This building is known as the Shingle House and it's in Cherokee Country, Georgia.  It's the only structure remaining from the Franklin Gold Mine, which dates back to the 1840s.  Around the turn of the century, the site had a power plant, chlorination plant, stamp mills, blacksmith and housing for workers.  The building in the photo served as a commissary and post office.  It sits alongside the Etowah River.  One of the reasons the gold mine closed was due to a significant mine shaft collapse.  No one died but the collapse was so dramatic, it actually caused the river to reverse direction for some time.  Local preservation groups wants to save this historically significant structure but it sits on private land today."
AbandonedPorn,3bl8se,dynamint,74,Tue Jun 30 13:23:44 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be straight with you here. You will get a ton of praise for this shot from people who don't do photography, but you're likely to get heckled by those who do. The ""HDR hole"" is a problem a lot of us fall into at some point in our careers before relying on the scene and composition rather than taking a bunch of what we shoot into Photomatix and cranking it to eleven.   I fell into the hole back when I started as well. Eventually found my way out when I found that shots that were absolutely mediocre that I put through Photomatix were getting more praise from my family than the photos that I actually thought deserved the recognition (more than the HDR'd ones, at least.)  The problem is a lot of people never get out of that hole and never better themselves as photographers, forever relying on HDR as a crutch rather than a tool. It's a shame.   The shot is good - looks like a cool place and you did a good job outside of the editing, but man, the tone mapping you've done here is about as subtle as a brick wall to the face at 100mph."
AbandonedPorn,3bl8se,coheedcollapse,19,Tue Jun 30 06:57:08 2015 UTC,"Not a photo person here: is that what that super annoying...burnt look is that's super popular? Everything's like retardedly vivid but burnt, beyond true to life - and the vignette is obnoxious.  If that's what HDR is, then yes, it seems like a super cop out to doing actual photography."
AbandonedPorn,3bl8se,TheWiredWorld,8,Tue Jun 30 12:00:04 2015 UTC,"My wife does it with every shot, the pasta looks like it's covered in neon blood paste and she insists it looks more realistic...  But it's not going anywhere because people love these shots. It's the fast food of photography. It makes your senses go crazy (vivid colours) even though it's actually quite absurd looking."

AbandonedPorn,3bl8se,RedWarBlade,-10,Tue Jun 30 20:10:04 2015 UTC,"There's actually minimal post on this shot. It is a 2-shot long exposure with adjusted levels and rain drops removed from the lens. Thanks for your comment though, I appreciate the feedback."
AbandonedPorn,3bl8se,coheedcollapse,24,Tue Jun 30 06:59:44 2015 UTC,"I edit photos pretty much daily for my job and you've pulled off a hell of a trick here if this is minimally edited. I'm looking at it on my phone, so maybe I'm missing something.   At the very least, saturation should come down a bit. The greens and yellows are off the chart.   By two shot long exposure do you mean you combined two shots? Did you do it manually, or with a tone mapping program? If you're using any of the typical HDR tools, a lot of their defaults slant far closer to cartoon world than reality. Plus, a lot of their automatic processing leaves a lot to be desired - there is what seems to be some pretty bad haloing around the house."
AbandonedPorn,3bl8se,littlescrub,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:07:51 2015 UTC,Yes. Two one-second exposure shots level adjusted and then merged in photoshop. The sky was incredible that evening. I'd never seen clouds so densely dark. The lighting was favorable. Right place right time.  I think the haloing you're referring to was caused by my lack of a remote shutter. The two shots didn't line up perfectly.
AbandonedPorn,3bl8se,coheedcollapse,21,Tue Jun 30 07:11:42 2015 UTC,Any chance of posting one of the original shots? I'm interested in seeing what it looks like completely unedited.
AbandonedPorn,3bl8se,coheedcollapse,9,Tue Jun 30 07:24:39 2015 UTC,"Well that's impressive, maybe my phone is deceiving my eyes or something, because I was nearly positive this was tonemapped.   Regardless, I'd still tone down the vibrance, it's pretty jarring and I think it definitely lended to my assumption that the photo went through Photomatix or equivalent.   The haloing wouldn't have been caused by missing a remote. The haloing I'm seeing is usually due to the tonemapping algorithm overcompensating for the differences between exposures and making a kind of ""glow"" that bleeds from lower exposure areas to higher. It could also be caused by manual dodging and burning if you're not being careful.  All of that said, it is a neat shot. Still not a fan of the post, but you did well a good job with the composition, for sure."
AbandonedPorn,3bl8se,figgen,8,Tue Jun 30 07:19:47 2015 UTC,"I'll see if I can dig up the raw files and give it another go. This shot was a few years ago on a D200, unfortunately. With a better body and a remote shutter the photo would be much clearer but I shoot as a hobby and can't afford better gear. Thanks for commenting!"
AbandonedPorn,3bl8se,coheedcollapse,5,Tue Jun 30 07:25:23 2015 UTC,"I know how that is. I shoot for a living and I also can't afford better gear, haha. If you ever get around to it, I'd love to see it."

AbandonedPorn,3bl8se,dontmasticate,3,Tue Jun 30 12:00:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've actually used that explanation in the past.  It's a bit past that in that I think autotune actually takes a bit more work than some over-hdr'd pictures. A lot of people just take a few bad exposures, run them through Photomatix at max settings automatically, and profit."
AbandonedPorn,3bl8se,CerealK,15,Tue Jun 30 15:33:20 2015 UTC,"I think my main issue is with the vibrance. The world just doesn't look like that. I love using multiple exposures to bring out the detail in the sky, but when you bump up the colors like crazy, then it is not to my taste. It might be to your taste. It might be to your customer's taste. That might be all that matters. Not everyone has the same goals."

AbandonedPorn,3bi4xy,AnneRat,8,Mon Jun 29 19:39:10 2015 UTC,"Referencing Metro: Last Light, a post-apocalyptic adventure game set partially in the Metro tunnels of Europe.  You play as the (mostly) silent protagonist, Artyom.  (Apparently I'm not the only one that noticed the resemblance looking at the comments!)  But yeah it's a fantastic game, I would check Metro 2033 and Last Light out (in that order)."
AbandonedPorn,3bi4xy,mutatersalad1,3,Mon Jun 29 20:40:18 2015 UTC,I will have a look. Are they full on shoot em ups or have role play elements to them too? Yes there has been quite a few references to it.
AbandonedPorn,3bi4xy,CouchWizard,3,Mon Jun 29 21:15:16 2015 UTC,There is a shoot em up aspect to it but the biggest element of the game is survival (though its possible to choose a gameplay mode where its more focused on the shoot em up aspects).  Your character doesn't level up or anything but there are many different guns you can acquire and modify over the course of the game.  It's a lot like Half-life 2 with survival horror aspects.

Haven't been there since 1998 so no idea how it is now. I hear they even go as far as the houses on the southeast tip of the campus. Teachers that lived in those houses would use the tunnels to get to various halls in winter. No idea if that's true or just a JAC legend

It's pretty ominous to see a big thunderstorm moving east. The Palmer Divide actually splits the weather patterns between the Denver metro area and the Colorado Springs area.

I am all for proper post-processing as long as one exercises restraint, because it can oftentimes enhance a photo and make it seem more vibrant and real...but I just cannot for the life of me see any reason to crank up these settings this high and make it look like some kind of alien hellscape. And comparing the reckless use of post-pro filters to historical art movements is a bit of a stretch."
AbandonedPorn,3b50mf,ewilliam,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:45:52 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the realist painters said the same thing about the impressionists and post impressionists in their time?   Or if you still don't agree with my referencing historical art movements, I'll use the more modern example of photography purists vs. photographers who use any post processing software.  Each style is different, and I guess if you're judging this photo on its realistic qualities, then yes, it does look like it's a radioactive cancer-inducing landscape.  But if you forget realism for a moment and focus on the way the colors work together, or the paint-like qualities of the photo and the story that it induces in your mind; then it becomes a little more interesting than it would be without any post-processing.  I guess I'm mainly objecting to this being labelled as bad by default because HDR (since I'm not really seeing any other reasons given), when if you compare it to other HDR images, it's actually quite nice.   It doesn't have any harsh halos or grainy noise issues that are so distracting in the bad ones, and I wouldn't consider this a hellscape by any means."

AbandonedPorn,3b2bpg,pfafulous,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:31:14 2015 UTC,Either that or it was originally supposed to before funding ran out.  I suppose it's also possible that the tank at the top had no liner and was replaced entirely.
AbandonedPorn,3b2bpg,MeEvilBob,6,Thu Jun 25 20:23:33 2015 UTC,"I wonder if that's original. My guess is that the water tank was contained within the tower originally, but eventually they needed more pressure so they moved the tank to the top.  It still never ceases to amaze me how so much infrastructure was built so beautifully, but only until recently was the maintenance of the purely aesthetic aspects taken seriously.  It's like the last century just didn't give a shit how things looked.  Sure, that tank likely looked neat when steel was still a new thing and it was all shiny, but still.  I'm also not just talking about Russia, this is true all over the world, the Hollywood sign in Los Angeles USA is another prime example, that thing was just left to rot until the late 1970s."
AbandonedPorn,3b2bpg,MeEvilBob,2,Thu Jun 25 20:22:33 2015 UTC,"Total speculation here, but if that tank were galvanised (which I'm guessing would be thing for a water tank, but not confident about dating that procedure), then the brick degradation would match with a tank that were treated as such. Plus, if I'm not mistaken a lot of turn-of-the-nineteenth-century water towers had wooden roofs covering the tanks, ergo the wooden outer shell perished, revealing the metal tank."
AbandonedPorn,3b2bpg,Lobstrich,4,Thu Jun 25 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"I think they used to have wooden upper structures that conceal the tanks, and that would perish before the steel or brick. I've seen it somewhere. I'll try and dig it out if anyone's interested."

In Britain Oliver Cromwell's 17th century battles are regarded as the real end of the castle, his use of heavy artillery totally removed any advantage castles had, but even before this time the murder hole was out of fashion as shot and cannon allowed a 'no go zone' to form around castles making it extremely unlike they'd be swarmed like had been possible when only facing sporadic arrow fire.   Russia had been using this tactic even before Cromwell's time, and in true Russian style had done it in a totally mad and extreme fashion.   The Tsar Cannon an absolutely huge weapon, maybe a bit too huge to be used in practice [although it's got marks from being fired at least once, no doubt this occasion involved vodka and aristocrats rather than blood and combat] their actual tactics were just as extreme and frightening...   A 12-metre high siege tower (referred to also as a ""battery-tower"" to distinguish it from the pre-gunpowder siege engines) was built by Ivan Vyrodkov out of wood on site for mounting siege cannon. This revolutionary new design could hold ten large-calibre cannon and 50 lighter cannon, allowing a concentration of artillery fire on a section of the wooden wall or city, which played a crucial role in shattering Tatar resistance. -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Kazan   [it's a door to provide light for the steps probably]"

And did the previous hut occupants leave provisions for the harshness?   Finally, what were you doing there and did you succeeded in your efforts? Sounds extreme,  hope there was a good reward at the end of it."
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,Captin_Banana,8,Thu Jun 25 23:07:03 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll try to answer everything the best that I can... Let me know if I miss anything! Thanks for your awesome questions; I appreciate the interest!  The cabin is on BLM land, and so anyone could do what they please there. The cabin itself is not a secret. It's on the map and what-not, but finding your way there can be a little complicated. I'm sure you can imagine... (1) It's 20 miles from an isolated tiny town, out in the middle of the mojave desert.. it's totally in the middle of nowhere, (2) you cannot see the cabin from the ""roads"" and so it's unlikely that you'd just stumble upon it, unless you're seeking it out, (3) the roads can be unpredictable because of washouts and what-not, and (4) there are a lot of seasonal access limitations. It's too hot in the summer and if there's any rain you shouldn't drive on the wet playa (even if it's just a tiny bit wet)... There are other reasons, of course, but I think it's just inconvenient.  There are indeed cabins out there where folks leave provisions, especially water but also sleeping pads, chairs, notebooks etc. etc. (not food, because critters will raid it). I even found one with one of those hospital toilet-chairs one day. Typically, people don't leave food, because the wildlife will just steal it and make a mess. Usually it's just somebody who's headed back home and donates their extra supplies -- There's no need to replace things; maybe pay it forward later on. The ""rules"" are basically to respect the space, clean up after yourself, and don't take more than what you need... I'd also say, don't take anything except water. It's really an awesome kindness that people put out there and I'm grateful for the times that water and shade have been there when I needed it.  Dangers in the area other than water and heat... Getting your car stuck is  really common. If you don't know what you're doing and/or you're not in a desert-friendly vehicle, it's pretty easy to sink yourself into the sand or bottom out. Other dangers are would be falling (since it's a long way for medical help and there's no cell-service). You could easily get lost if you don't have your map and compass also (since stuff kind of looks the same until you learn the area). Keeping track of time is also important, because the terrain is too harsh to hike in at night. There's some rattle snakes, but they won't bother you unless you startle them and they're easy enough to kill, if you absolutely need to. The other less-obvious danger is giving into temptation and exploring some of the more treacherous mines.  The previous occupants of the specific cabin that I stayed at were the same people that I went out with and so it was kind of set up for us already, to a degree. It was originally a mining cabin, but geology folks have repaired it and taken care of it for a bunch of years now. Folks go to it because it's right next to some controversial rocks that a hand full of groups are trying to understand.  So basically... yes things are left behind... but it's functional sort of stuff (like some outhouses they built, maps of the area, christmas lights, etc.).  And finally, I was out there trying to connect some of the rocks that crop out near the cabin to other parts of the Mojave. I spent a week hiking for about 8 hrs a day, collecting samples of what I found, taking notes, and making maps of what I saw. It was very successful - I got excellent feedback and was able to come up with a petty solid hypothesis; I think it's the most detailed work anyone's done on those particular rocks. It's an amazing feeling when the task itself turns out turns out to be the reward on its own!! I hope that somebody else follows it up, so that I know whether I'm correct or not. :D"
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,Rafikim,2,Fri Jun 26 00:09:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions. I've not been to a desert or anywhere remotely that harsh so it's interesting to hear about it. Sounds like you're an incredibly dedicated geologist!
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,Tirkaz,2,Fri Jun 26 17:54:42 2015 UTC,"if there's any rain you shouldn't drive on the wet playa (even if it's just a tiny bit wet)...    Wanted to expand upon this a little bit:  If you're ever in any area with playa (specifically in/around Death Valley), please do NOT drive on, step on, touch, throw rocks into, etc. the playa. Whatever footprints or physical indentations will be there for many years because of the nature of the playa. Once it dries and the rain comes again, it won't wash away. It will stay there for a very long time.   Please help preserve the beauty of the playa for yourself and other people by not touching it."
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,enoughwithcats,5,Fri Jun 26 01:06:56 2015 UTC,He had to kill the group of raiders that aggroed when he got close
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,EkriirkE,25,Thu Jun 25 19:35:21 2015 UTC,Any pics of what it looked like inside?
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,enoughwithcats,17,Thu Jun 25 12:59:09 2015 UTC,"These aren't much and none are from me; I don't know who deserves credit for them. They don't do it justice though. There's essentially just a room for cooking and a room for hanging out. The walls are covered with trinkets, drawings, quotes etc. -- it's a tradition to leave some evidence of yourself behind, if you stay at the cabin, and so it's pretty neat inside!  Here is one  And another  And one more  One more"
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,Haki23,3,Thu Jun 25 16:39:59 2015 UTC,"Whoa, that's quite roomy!"
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,EkriirkE,3,Thu Jun 25 17:17:23 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, it's HUGE inside! Deceiving from the outside, thanks for sharing :)"
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,micmea1,2,Thu Jun 25 23:47:06 2015 UTC,Thank YOU for taking interest!
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,PigEqualsBakon,5,Fri Jun 26 00:10:33 2015 UTC,Seconded
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,Turbofurball,16,Thu Jun 25 14:22:49 2015 UTC,"There are a few of these around there, meant for (stranded) off-roaders to hole up.  They seem to be kept stocked with water/alcohol & dry goods.  I hope you keep it that way OP."
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,another_deleted_acct,5,Thu Jun 25 12:51:18 2015 UTC,"This one actually isn't a supply cabin - there are two of those that i found about 3 miles south and I'm sure several more around the hills. The one in the picture is mostly used by misc. science folk who need a spot to bunk down for their field work. There, it's a tradition to leave things behind, but it's more like wall decor, bottles, alcohol, parts of your car that broke off on the drive etc. etc., not survival supplies."
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,Rafikim,3,Thu Jun 25 17:00:25 2015 UTC,Reminds me of the houses/other shelters made available for the cross country cyclists along the standard bike routes. You can't carry much so there would be left over food left in the fridge with notes from the other cyclists saying hi and telling you if that food has been there for a day or a month.
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,GreyGoff,2,Thu Jun 25 16:29:04 2015 UTC,Gotta have the booze.
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,EkriirkE,5,Thu Jun 25 15:01:51 2015 UTC,Cosy :-)
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,Rafikim,3,Thu Jun 25 10:59:32 2015 UTC,I have often gone to sleep at night fantasizing about me against the elements in some kind of half ass abandoned shelter. You have literally lived my dream! Of course I then fluff up my pillow and pull the covers up in my comfy bed....
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,EkriirkE,3,Thu Jun 25 21:15:50 2015 UTC,Get a few friend together and do it one of these days. :) There are cabins all over BLM land. I know that's definitely the case in Nevada and southern California.  It's not as rugged as it looks. ;) You can do it!
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,Rafikim,3,Fri Jun 26 00:25:42 2015 UTC,"As OP said, there's really no reason not to do it with a couple buddies if that's what you want!  Cabins that are perfectly legal to stay in for a couple days or a week are all over the Death Valley area, and they scream history.   I've visited up above Panamint Valley;it was essentially an old boxcar converted into a cabin. It had 3 main rooms, I believe, and signatures and writings all over the walls. Not much in the way of supplies besides a few bottles of liquor and a lighter, however."
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,Rafikim,3,Fri Jun 26 01:14:32 2015 UTC,So an Oasis in Death valley!
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,caseyst,5,Thu Jun 25 08:35:52 2015 UTC,"Nah man, that's bad water!"
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,caseyst,3,Thu Jun 25 12:51:32 2015 UTC,Were you talking about literal bad water or the town/region Badwater?
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,_Fah-Q_,2,Fri Jun 26 01:10:22 2015 UTC,"Both! it was a play on badwater basin  Legend goes the original surveyor on his mule found the oasis and brought his mule to drink, and it refused.  Because it was bad water (really, super saturated salt water), he noted as such the map and the name stuck.    Also allegedly is/was the lowest point in the western hemisphere -- but the wiki says different?  The plaques at the site still hold the claim as of a couple weeks ago when I was there last..."
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,h8sgonah8,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:18:11 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, about how Badwater Basin got its name. I've not heard that tale before.   As for the lowest point thing, I've heard before it was the lowest (natural) point on Earth, however I had my doubts. I'd trust the plaque before the wiki."
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,EkriirkE,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:10:07 2015 UTC,Oh man... I'm a derp! haha
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,Luna_Sakara,2,Fri Jun 26 01:18:05 2015 UTC,"Haha, no worries! And happy cake day!"
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,astrolabos,2,Fri Jun 26 02:08:18 2015 UTC,It really is super nasty. I only found one pool of water while I was out there and it was horrific. It was a few inches deep and so full of grossness that you couldn't see the bottom. Derp.
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,LLv2,3,Thu Jun 25 18:04:00 2015 UTC,I like the attempt at curb appeal landscaping near the front door.
AbandonedPorn,3b1vbc,Photoandtech,4,Thu Jun 25 14:26:05 2015 UTC,Right?! I also love Can Man.
AbandonedPorn,3b3e8f,ThePropellerHead,3,Thu Jun 25 17:21:36 2015 UTC,Corner Gas
AbandonedPorn,3b3e8f,MoshPotato,2,Thu Jun 25 23:26:20 2015 UTC,Back in the 90s the EPA changed how in ground fuel tanks are to be designed and what materials they're made of. Due to this a lot of places closed because they couldn't afford to replace their tanks.
AbandonedPorn,3b3e8f,burrgerwolf,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:00:10 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks so much that would likely explain it considering this place is just a small, private station and not a major fuel brand."
AbandonedPorn,3b3e8f,jgilley23,0,Fri Jun 26 03:53:58 2015 UTC,Eh I live in the south (Alabama USA) and literally see 15 or so a day but the effort is there so keep finding things and taking pics.
