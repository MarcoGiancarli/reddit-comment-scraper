Melanime,27zuie,winwar,2,Fri Jun 13 01:30:42 2014 UTC,"Oh man, I haven't seen that anime. I need to mentally prepare my self for when I do ;w;"
Melanime,27zuie,Madu_Scientist,2,Fri Jun 13 10:07:19 2014 UTC,"It's part of the OVAs, which takes place between season 1&2"

Melanime,27r2rq,ForeignMumbles,6,Tue Jun 10 02:10:59 2014 UTC,Puns are among the lowest form of humor. More please.
Melanime,27r2rq,vaendryl,3,Tue Jun 10 04:49:39 2014 UTC,puns are like the aces in a deck of cards. simultaneously the highest and lowest.

Melanime,24uiys,an1musvox,6,Tue May 6 13:37:09 2014 UTC,"Have you seen Rebellion?  Pretty sure that's the outfit Homura (or the image of her anyway) wears just prior to fully becoming a witch. Works with OPs title which refers to the ""stare long enough into abyss and the abyss also stares into you"" quote (paraphrasing) which is about becoming the very thing you fight. In Homura's case, it's her becoming a witch after fighting them for so long."
Melanime,24uiys,PiippoN,1 point,Tue May 6 17:41:31 2014 UTC,Ok? I have watched rebellion but I have really bad memory...

Melanime,24o8qp,Funderfullness,3,Sun May 4 04:35:23 2014 UTC,"Source.  Quote from Fate/Extra:   She eventually decided to kill herself, though such an end was considered unsportsmanlike by her. She stopped herself many times, having cried about, ""How can such a magnificent artist disappear from this world?"", but as those who betrayed her closed in she quoted a line from Homer's Iliad, ""Hark, now strikes on my ear the trampling of swift-footed coursers!"", before finally stabbing her own throat with a knife. After Nero's suicide, a soldier delicately wrapped a cloak around Nero's body. ""Too late. This is fidelity,"" Nero said. Those were her last words."

Melanime,248qnz,KBKarma,1 point,Tue Apr 29 02:11:03 2014 UTC,Thanks. Interesting: that quote reads like Streets of Laredo.
Melanime,248qnz,KBKarma,2,Tue Apr 29 15:23:29 2014 UTC,I think it was intended. The choruses of The Green Fields of France and The Streets of Laredo are too close to be a coincidence.
