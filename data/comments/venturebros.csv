He said it was being advertised at the con as a screening of All This and Gargantua-2, but ended up being an all new episode. Since he'd already seen All This and Gargantua-2 he skipped the screening.   Unfortunately, I think this is what happened with most hardcore Venture fans and more casual fans ended up seeing it and not flooding the internet with details.  But then there's the logical inconsistency that hardcore fans should be clamoring at the chance to watch the show on a big screen with other fans whether they'd seen the episode or not.

venturebros,3d6h0f,IanBurns,8,Tue Jul 14 02:26:24 2015 UTC,"After reading your post and thinking back on all the episodes (I'm a Venture junkie myself.) I've come to ponder something. Each generation of the Ventures have twins. Rusty and J.J. Hank and Dean. Perhaps Dr. Venture Sr. had a twin brother or sister. Therefore making The Monarch (Malcolm) Rusty's cousin.  The Monarch doesn't know much about his childhood because he was orphaned so young, so perhaps from that trauma alone he doesn't remember much of Rusty other than his intense hatred from something tiny that resulted in their childhood.  Now I understand many of you are gonna think I'm dumb and it's just a fan theory, and god knows I've read some really dumb theories on the Venture universe that makes no sense... But it really seems like they're leading up to this great reveal of blood relation between Rusty and the Monarch.  http://i.imgur.com/NmOZFpf.jpg Look at the Monarch's moms hair color. Seems identical to Dr. Venture Senior's. So if anything I think the Monarch's mother was Dr. Venture Seniors twin sister who changed her name when she got married. Thus flying under the radar. If Dr. Venture cuckolded the Monarch's father, wouldn't that make the Monarch's hair color the same as Rusty's?  But anything is possible! This is the ventureverse we're talking about!"

venturebros,3d6h0f,BobbyBenzobbi,5,Tue Jul 14 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"I was kind of conflicted as to whether Killinger's ""not you"" meant that the Monarch wouldn't be a part of the Council of 13, or if he was just talking about the big chair (presumably for the new Sovereign, Killinger himself). But your logic makes a lot more sense. Monarch never seemed like a bad guy, just someone who misguidedly devotes his entire life to a single purpose. The purpose just happens to be arching Dr. Venture, but like you said, the line between good and bad doesn't define who the characters really are."

venturebros,3d6h0f,Treyantula,3,Wed Jul 15 19:09:15 2015 UTC,"Great post. Couple thoughts.  The guild leaders still have arches so arching Dr. Venture wouldn't be out of the question. However, I really think they are going to expand on the monarch's family soon.   My theory is that the monarch is rusty's half brother. We know Jonas Sr. was a swinger and there's a lot of subtle hints (""I know how to think like a venture"" as you mentioned). I feel like that's a twist they would totally put in the show. The show became so much more than simple laughs a long time ago, and the season finale of season 4 and the Gargantua 2 episode have left me with some pretty deep feels."
venturebros,3d6h0f,PulpandComicFan,2,Tue Jul 14 01:59:07 2015 UTC,"I have one big question to go along with the even bigger pile of questions piling up in my noodle. Can I have your brain? Cause the way you have put everything together is just insanely brilliant.   Also, do we know who actually makes up the new Council of 13 proper? I tried to put it together but got a wee bit brain scrambled."
venturebros,3d6h0f,BobbyBenzobbi,5,Tue Jul 14 18:57:37 2015 UTC,"Dr. Mrs. The Monarch is for certain.  Henry Killinger, unless he steps back, which isn't out of the question.  Phantom Limb, most likely.  Fat Chance, Underbheit, and Radical Left (most likely, since they trained under Killinger, though Fat Chance is the only one with useful powers).  Maybe Watch and Ward, since they led the Guild Resistance.  Maybe Prof. Incorrigible, though he's got his own family problems to worry about.   I'm hoping Gary, since he's more competent than his boss, but probably not.   Sorry if I wasted your time. The only real ""for sure"" is Dr. Mrs. The Monarch."
venturebros,3d5uez,wise_idiot,37,Mon Jul 13 19:31:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry buddy but I don't think so. Gathers moved SPHINX into the abandoned manufacturing wing out of convenience, to stay under both Guild and OSI radar.    Presumably Gathers, Shore Leave, Sky Pilot and the others brought all the old OSI confiscated SPHINX stuff with them. So the Command Uniforms and Red Button likely just came with them.  When the old SPHINX veterans show up they are able to find their old stuff and operate the systems because of their familiarity. They may have even brought their old costumes with them.   I don't see any evidence for Jonas being a SPHINX supporter."
venturebros,3d5uez,Waldo19,9,Mon Jul 13 19:41:32 2015 UTC,"I think he's pointing out that they knew of the location of the uniforms in the Sphinx HQ (on Venture property). Wind Song says ""They were in the back, in the Command Gear Hold"" and Gary freaks out not knowing that was even there.  It can be explained easily by assuming that the Sphinx guys were looking for their stuff while Gary was kind of hanging around the compund, it's not exactly like he has a staff to do inventory. Agreed on Jonas not being Sphinx-aligned though."
venturebros,3d5uez,out_of_the_void,12,Mon Jul 13 20:59:50 2015 UTC,"I believe the ""command gear hold"" is located inside of the S.P.H.I.N.X. ship. just because the first time we see them in uniform is outside of the ship, doesn't mean they couldn't have gotten changed inside the ship."
venturebros,3d5uez,tim_tim_salabim,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:50:24 2015 UTC,"Edit: Misread that comment. It's possible but Gary's shown as in front of the Sphinx ship the whole episode until that point. Meaning he would have seen them come out of the ship with that stuff on but is surprised when Hank busts through the wall (not near the ship) and they all walk through. Besides, why would the (now) OSI guys keep old Sphinx gear they weren't using on the Sphinx ship they were using? Seems dumb on their part if the gear was in fact on the ship.  Gary just fucked up, lots of people fuck up on this show."
venturebros,3d5uez,out_of_the_void,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:09:05 2015 UTC,"I'd also say you're reading to much into it. If you've ever listened to any of the commentary, the're constantly talking about how much they have to cut for time constraints...  I think the point is gotten across by ""busting"" them in there and just saying found them in the command hold instead of a scene with them finding them (the suits),  putting them on, and leaving through a door on the Sphinx. Wich by the way is way smaller in that scene than it is when its flying around with Gary and crew in it... Just a cartoon animated over seas man."
venturebros,3d5uez,CobraExspenseAccount,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:32:21 2015 UTC,"Well, using that logic, why would the (now) OSI guys bring along the old sphinx gear to begin with?

It is one of only two SSTs to enter commercial service, the other being the Anglo-French Concorde. The design, publicly unveiled in January 1962, was constructed in the Soviet Union under the direction of the Tupolev design bureau, headed by Alexei Tupolev.   The prototype first flew on 31 December 1968 near Moscow,  two months before the first flight of Concorde. The Tu-144 first went supersonic on 5 June 1969, and on 26 May 1970 became the first commercial transport to exceed Mach 2.  A Tu-144 crashed in 1973 at the Paris Air Show, delaying its further development. The aircraft was introduced into passenger service on 1 November 1977, almost two years after Concorde. In May 1978, another Tu-144 (an improved version, named Tu-144D) crashed in a test flight while being delivered, and the passenger fleet was permanently grounded after only 55 scheduled flights. The aircraft remained in use as a cargo aircraft until 1983, by which point a total of 102 commercial flights had been completed. The Tu-144 was later used by the Soviet space program to train pilots of the Buran spacecraft, and by NASA for supersonic research.

I mean, think about it. Rusty is a super selfish individual who doesn't seem to have much of a care for being a father. It almost seems like he's stuck in the mold of being a ""boy adventurer"", so when he became an adult he figured he needed a kid to continue the cycle.  My personal theory (completely unfounded though it may be) is that Rusty was infatuated/in love with a girl, couldn't stay with her for whatever reason, and used her eggs somehow to have a child in his lab. However, he never meant for twins which completely messed with his vague plan.  A slightly sweeter notion might be that he fell in love with someone who he was going to have a family with but she died prematurely or was killed somehow, and he either concocted the boys from her DNA, somehow got ahold of her eggs, or they were born before she died.  I dunno. After all this time I'd like some closure, but I don't want it to be overly ""wacky"".

I believe the Original Guild split around the turn of the century to become The Guild of Calamitous Intent and the government agency that would eventually become the OSI.   Not sure where you are getting this from, but it's untrue. OSI already existed independently of the guild in Col. Venture's days, otherwise who would have given Sandow the order to kill Col. Venture if he tried to activate the orb, not even mentioning his role as a bodyguard."
venturebros,3c9wug,AldusValor,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:47:27 2015 UTC,"The order could have come from anywhere. I get my information from within the show itself.   (Assassinanny 911) Hunter reveals that the OSI has been ""thanklessly been defending this nation since the second American Revolution. The invisible one. I believe that the aerial battle shown in ""Orb"" to be the beginning of that event.   (Operation P.R.O.M.) Hunter reminds General Treister that he ""spent his whole life building [The OSI]."" This implies a later date of creation, because even if we assume Treister had been building it since the actual day of his birth, it wouldn't have started until the late 1930's."
venturebros,3c9wug,Claud_And_Us,2,Mon Jul 6 12:14:01 2015 UTC,"Well, if we're just working on beliefs, what makes your belief that the aerial battle shown in the flashback is the second American Revolution any more valid than my belief that Sandow is OSI?   Personally, I think the second American Revolution line was just a throwaway gag, which they did very frequently without picking them up in the earlier seasons.   Sandow being OSI at least had some evidence to support it. The fact that he was given orders to kill Col Venture in case he attempts to activate the orb implies there was some non affiliated organization, separate from the guild, that have him those orders. In addition, the fact that orders are the exact same as the ones received by Kano and Brock says to me that it was the same organization that gave those orders.   Also, the ""spent his whole life building the OSI""  doesn't imply that he created the OSI, at least to me. Even if it did, it would invalidate your theory on the guild splitting to create the OSI and GCI, as Treister would definitely not have been alive during the events of the flashback."

Whatever the answer is, It certainly has something to do with:  A) Space and Aliens (Warned Jonas Sr. about preparing for the Grand Galactic Inquisitor*)  B) The ORB  There is an obvious ""Invisible Hand of Fate""  at work here.  For now those hands belong to Doc&Jac.  But I speculate that the creation of ORB, The Guild and OSI were all created by Aliens.  As advanced as The Grand Galactic Inquisitor, if not the same Species.    I base this theory on the fact that the ORB was first worked on by Archimedes   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes  Col. Venture: ""The orb! Archimedes himself began the construction with little more than a mirror alignment! da Vinci added the gearings. Newton the lenses. Galileo the prisms! And all of the great poets, painters, scientists, alchemists and philosophers have had the orb in their hands.""  Couldn't it be possible that Archimedes was contacted by Aliens to begin construction of the ORB way back in 250+/- BC, just as the Great Jonas Sr. was contacted in 1960-70?   Also;  Force Majeure = ""Superior Force"" like Aliens.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_majeure  Force Majeure's Lair was Meteor Majeure also in Space.

I'm pretty sure they were just a bunch of friends of the hulk who pretty much helped form the original avengers team.  With Phantom Limb being evil, cruelty breeds cruelty, I'm pretty sure he was shunned from his family of adventurers due to his deformity.

venturebros,3c6hii,TheLemoncloak,6,Sun Jul 5 12:10:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the OSI, largely regarded that job as a punishment. For the same reason Hunter was transferred to Guam.

Cloning is illegal and it is hinted at that rusty is a skilled scientist when it comes to cloning , tho we do learn in the Halloween special he had help but how much he had is unkown.

The 18 year-old kid is waking dishes in the back. I get the brilliant idea to fill a garbage bag with water and throw it outside like a water balloon.   I get it about half-filled and turn to the kid and tell him that I don't think it's gonna work, as I try to lift it out of the sink. It bursts under its own weight and covers my entire left half with water. Kid got a good laugh out of it, and without missing a beat, I told him that I just found out that my nipples work as a team, while grabbing my dry right nipple.  No, seriously, come feel this grab-on I got going on here. It's like a pencil eraser!  I never thought I'd ever get to work that one into conversation. One of my proudest moments."

Evening (The Fall of Day) is believed to be a depiction of Apollo, not Icarus.  Icarus wasn't an angel who flew to close to the Sun.  He was a mortal man and the son of Daedalus who constructed wings of feather and wax so that he and his son could escape the Labyrinth.  He warned his son not to fly too close to the Sun because its heat would melt the wax causing the feathers to come loose.  Icarus didn't listen and down he went.  A real fan of Zeppelin can point out if I'm off base, but I would say for the purposes of Zeppelin it's supposed to be a fallen angel (Lucifer), but many people think it's Icarus (not an angel), but the original inspiration is thought to be Apollo.    Don't take my word for it though and by all means correct me if you find out otherwise."

VB doesn't have that kind of controversy, so I don't think it's worth comparing to ATHF.  As for ending the series, I'd say not likely. ATAG2 cleaned up a lot of the mythology by closing a lot of plot lines, killing off a lot of characters who were somewhat unnecessary (the Council of 13's character designs were initially just copies of pre-existing characters with minor changes), and made way for new plot lines, such as the move to NYC and the new Guild."

Yeah this is the last season. Only to have 'The Venture Bros will be back' in the season ending credits. So either they get burnt out while making the seasons. Then say they're going to end it only to realize when they rest up they want to keep going. Or they just like trolling.

venturebros,3b9jve,Oldskoolguitar,2,Wed Jul 1 22:11:07 2015 UTC,"The Venture Compound is located in or near Colorado Springs.   ""Trivia: The location of the Venture compound is revealed in the opening scene when Otaku Senzuri is reading the newspaper article announcing Dr. Venture's new invention: Colorado Springs.""  ""In the pilot episode, the compound's location was revealed to be in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the home to a number of U.S. military bases and defense industry contractors. This may also be an homage to the brilliant but eccentric scientist Nikola Tesla, who also had a laboratory near Colorado Springs.""  ""I disagree. The Cocoon is shown hiding out in the Grand Canyon (Arizona) and it seems near to the Venture Compound. Billy and Peter's trailer is located in a desert locale. And when Rusty needed some daily labor physicists he went to a street corner and tried to hire some Mexicans. So I think the Venture Compound is located in the Southwest.""  Even if we assume that ""The Terrible Secret of Turtle Bay"" is non-canonical (which is reasonably likely, Thank God) the topography, art style and ""feel"" of the area strongly suggest Colorado and there is no reason to believe that some things were not held over from the pilot, canonical or not.   Since most of the Venture Universe has been located in Colorado the writers have taken great pains to move the characters (Monarch et. al. to New Jersey, Venture clan and old Team Venture to Manhattan, etc.) and set the foundation for the move (previous New York based episodes with new characters, the old Venture/Impossible Industries Building, the New Venture Industries etc.). We also know that through a combination of super science/magic and writer's convenience the Colorado characters can get to NYC easily (think Phage's attack on Prof. Impossible)."

venturebros,3az2ao,mcdrunkin,4,Thu Jun 25 05:14:01 2015 UTC,They also were reshowing old shows like Mission Hill and Oblongs from the get-go.

venturebros,3az2ao,ghostofpennwast,15,Thu Jun 25 01:10:57 2015 UTC,"...it's relevant in my mind as ATHF is another of Adult Swim's popular animated series, and this might help predict how many more seasons of VB we get.   While I kinda see where you're coming from, they're two entirely different types of show. A lot of people seem to think that Rick and Morty's success has shown that [AS] can create more conventional accessible, popular content while still keeping it ""weird."" I think VB falls more into the R&M category than the ATHF category. I don't think is any indication that VB is gonna lose support from [AS]."
venturebros,3az2ao,fartxparty,13,Thu Jun 25 03:27:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ATHF was more in the robot chicken category. Sort of where I think AS found its roots. Shows that feel like they were made in a basement and bring a unique style and humor. Though I also feel like all those types of shows were hit or miss. Tim and Eric was probably the most extreme of hit or miss.   I remember the first episode of VB airing on AS, it was something very different. I imagine its how some people might have felt with R&M first aired.   I also would put VB and R&M in the same category. While ATHF, Robot Chick and T&E would be in a different one."
venturebros,3az2ao,gwarsh41,3,Thu Jun 25 04:47:23 2015 UTC,"I showed my friends venture bros and they liked it but man they had no idea it existed. Whereas when Rick and Morty became popular, it was all over reddit and other friends were talking about it.  Venture Bros is pretty easy to get into but it's just not well known."
venturebros,3az2ao,Thehelloman0,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:57:30 2015 UTC,"Oh I'll agree it's no where near as popular, just saying I'd put them in the same category."
venturebros,3az2ao,fartxparty,10,Wed Jun 24 18:14:36 2015 UTC,I know people are saying that ATHF doesn't compare with Venture Bros. but they did the same thing with Metalocalypse and Samurai Jack; network execs don't make decisions that make sense.
venturebros,3az2ao,KotoElessar,4,Thu Jun 25 02:47:05 2015 UTC,Due to this comment I looked up what happened to Metalocalypse. Damn. I was patiently waiting that 5 season like I do for VB seasons. I'm not pleased w/ AS about that.
venturebros,3az2ao,radjose,7,Thu Jun 25 02:52:08 2015 UTC,"They treat Small so poorly. They fought him tooth and nail about animating Doomstar, then they cancel season 5 after the preproduction already began.   When a network behaves like that it really does make me fear for the Venture Bros, which has always been my favorite AS show. Either the network has officially stopped valuing quality shows or I am officially too old to know what's cool anymore."
venturebros,3az2ao,satisfried,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:44:42 2015 UTC,I feel like if they can VB they will find a way to finish it. Even if it's a kickstarter based movie or something.

venturebros,3az2ao,Sweatybanderas,12,Wed Jun 24 23:01:04 2015 UTC,"Cartoon Network has always been pretty secretive about what they'll air and when.  You always have to dig for premiere dates and upcoming shows... it's always baffled me.  Also their strange approval of  tim heidecker and aeric wareheim? Their shows, for some reason, I could never get in to. Nor do I know anyone who admits to watching it religously. Yet they're always somewhere in the lineup..."
venturebros,3az2ao,Pirateer,6,Wed Jun 24 21:07:43 2015 UTC,"Nor do I know anyone who admits to watching it religously   I admit it. I watched everything they did (TGTTM is still my favorite) and have seen them live 3 times. I saw the movie in theaters - alone in that one.  I also like many of the live shows that they've (AS) done. Children's Hospital is funny, but I liked Rising Son and The Heart She Holler a lot, too. And things like... Xavier: Renegade Angel... that's one of my favorite shows of all time.  Honestly, I think I like just about everything except anime that's been on adult swim."

Then classics like sea lab and whatnot...   I almost blame Tim & Eric.  I have fond memories of (years ago) turning on adult swim and watching EVERYTHING. Then Tom goes to the mayor cane on and I lost interest. And now adult swim isn't recognizable (much like mtv)

venturebros,3az2ao,mcdrunkin,13,Thu Jun 25 07:32:59 2015 UTC,"Although I love ATHF, I think it went on for far too many seasons. S6 was the last time I was laughing out loud over it. Also, this really doesn't have anything to do with Venture Bros. Just because ATHF gets cancelled after what, 15 years(?) doesn't mean they have any plans to cancel a show that has a progressive story that is still building up, like Venture Bros."
venturebros,3az2ao,DJdekutree,5,Thu Jun 25 00:19:47 2015 UTC,"Right there with you. A couple years back I tried catching some of the ""new"" episodes and I just wasn't laughing. If anything I was getting annoyed. If there's ever been a show that was just sort of coasting and rambling, it's the latter seasons of ATHF."
venturebros,3az2ao,SoulUnison,-3,Thu Jun 25 07:34:07 2015 UTC,"Straight up.   I don't believe for a second it still produced a lot of revenue, this seems like butthurt creators trying to give an excuse."

venturebros,3az2ao,toxicroach,2,Fri Jun 26 02:58:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, but it's hard to imagine how a show that costs so little and does so well would be canceled against the creator's will. Seems like a no brainier to air it until people stop watching if dollars are your concern."
venturebros,3az2ao,satisfried,3,Thu Jun 25 04:53:01 2015 UTC,"From what I know, they simply decided not to renew it after 11 seasons. I wouldn't mind of the Ventures were wrapped up in the next 1 or 2 seasons myself, although since there's such a large break in between seasons they could keep it going fresh for longer. ATHF is just a show that can keep going on since it has no storyline. I think Dave Willis even said in his AMA that after S6, the show was just whatever they wanted it to be."
venturebros,3az2ao,SlumberCat,4,Wed Jun 24 18:26:38 2015 UTC,They have vaguely mentioned two more seasons. One can only hope. I'd love to see two more seasons and one more special. And then the totally random out of the blue special every four years until I die.

venturebros,3az2ao,datchilla,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:35:21 2015 UTC,Yea I like VB more than I like ATHF and I not knowing anything about revenue I would hazard a guess that ATHF is/was pulling in more than VB. If a show ATHF is getting pulled then I can't imagine VB is in a much better position. But the article doesn't actually give a reason why ATHF was pulled so this really all speculation.

VB, on the other hand, has a slight air of mystery, is masterfully crafted, and has a long running story arc that needs to finish/conclude.  I honestly don't have any fears that VB will be cancelled anytime soon. My biggest fear is that it will end like Lost; with confusion and forced closure."

venturebros,3asds1,LaserblastLizard,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:27:48 2015 UTC,"If Shirt Club does return this season, I plan to go from long time enthusiast, to full fledged member.  I hear the pool has a high dive."
venturebros,3asds1,poprocksncoke515,4,Sun Jun 28 18:16:54 2015 UTC,"As far as I remember, Last season I believe it was $160 for all  eight(?) shirts. If you joined the full season club you got a ninth shirt that the ones who were buying individually did not get to purchase. With each shirt last season you got a Hank Buck. At the end of the season you turned in your Hank Bucks to get a certain amount of money off a Hank Buck towel. I think I got the first shirt several weeks after the first episode aired. I was still receiving shirts two months or so after the season ended. If you joined the club you got the shirt for a couple dollars less than those buying individually. Plus the extra shirt."

venturebros,3apq6m,Noxonius,12,Mon Jun 22 14:33:20 2015 UTC,"Ignore This!  Just kidding, I had a theory that the Statue on The Venture Compound is actually pointing to where Jonas Sr. is in Space.  The Statue of Jonas Sr. is literally holding The Rusty, pointing to the stars...OK you can't see them right now because we're in the city....but those stars!  They're always watching us!  Also on The Statue or grave of Jonas Jr. says ""Back unto the Stars from Whence I came.""  MMMM....MMMM....MMMM.....MMMM.  Thanks for making me watch that again!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDRIMO7AL8U  You may be right!  You may be Crazy?!"
venturebros,3apq6m,SuperSmokingMonkey,2,Mon Jun 22 17:37:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I've thought about that too because they have made several references to that statue and the grave quote.

venturebros,3apq6m,CircularMatrix,4,Tue Jun 23 02:20:08 2015 UTC,"I like your theory here, but I am pretty sure the ending of ""20 Years to Midnight"" explains that it was just a random alien sent to kill the Pan-Galactic Inquisitor. The very last part of the episode the alien reveals his true form, and it scares the shit out of everybody. I think that was really just an alien and not connected to Jonas Sr. or the Sovereign."
venturebros,3apq6m,DJdekutree,2,Mon Jun 22 16:35:20 2015 UTC,Boom boom.
venturebros,3apq6m,cyvaris,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:02:36 2015 UTC,Except... That the message from space was directed directly to him. Rusty was jumping over lava carpet squares at the time.
venturebros,3apq6m,blaspheminCapn,3,Wed Jun 24 13:18:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, probably, but how did the aliens know that the Galactic inquisitor would come to Earth in the distant future to destroy all life on it? Also Jonas seemed to know that he wasn't going to be around when Rusty received the message, it's not uncommon to see your child reach the age of 40-50. And who placed the box under Brock's bed? When we first cut to Brock's room in the episode, there's nothing under the bed, but on the next shot, the box is there. While this is likely an animation error, the box was clearly placed there recently, as Brock had never noticed it there before and I'm sure he cleans his room up quite often...so who was it? Also why did the alien take Jonas' form anyway? Seems kinda specific...did he read Rusty's mind before coming to Earth or what?"
venturebros,3apq6m,DJdekutree,2,Mon Jun 22 16:44:28 2015 UTC,"Wait, were you replying to me? If you are, then you bring up some good points. If that wasn't an animation error then they added the box on purpose, you are right. As far as reading Rusty's mind, I am sure that a shapeshifting teleporting alien would be able to do whatever it wants as far as I am concerned."
venturebros,3apq6m,ShoutyCrackers,2,Mon Jun 22 16:48:12 2015 UTC,"Yes I was replying to you, just forgot to add it as a reply to you. I might be reading too much into this, but I'm just trying to cook up a theory here, as Jonas' absence is the very core of the show. There are many other theories too on what happened to him, like, maybe he became the ''Secret President''? When I first saw Jonas Sr. in the special I honestly thought that was him and I paused the video and thought ''oh my god, it's Jonas sr!'' only to be really disappointed later on. I understand that keeping it as a mystery makes the show interesting, but still..."
venturebros,3apq6m,ItsVoodooViking,2,Mon Jun 22 17:07:51 2015 UTC,Don't reply to me...  IGNORE ME!
venturebros,3apq6m,scottmill,2,Mon Jun 22 23:17:57 2015 UTC,"I think the alien taking Sr.'s form may have just been a reference to the movie Contact...but who knows?  They're crazy about details, so it could be nothing or anything."
venturebros,3apq6m,PulpandComicFan,2,Mon Jun 22 22:33:54 2015 UTC,"The Galactic Inquisitor seems pretty bound by protocol, so they might have been able to figure out when he was due to arrive at Earth, either based on his projected route or some other criteria regarding when Earth is to be judged.    As far as the Sovereign, who's a self-admitted nobody who wants to be somebody, I have no problem believing that he's a random alien with shapeshifting ability who came to some backwater planet to throw his weight around.  Being leader of a secret organization keeps him from being noticed by guys like the alien impersonating Jonas while letting him act like a big shot.  And it's the kind of pathetic ambition that fits with the shows themes."
venturebros,3apq6m,scottmill,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:23:50 2015 UTC,"My big question is, will we EVER find out what happened to Jonas? I mean come on, the world's foremost scientist/philanthropist/adventurer just up and dies and we still get no explanation? My inner fanboy growls with anger at the prospect of not getting information. He must be fed.   But in all seriousness, finding out what caused Dr. Venture Sr. to either die or vanish from the face of the Earth with no trace would be a cool as heck episode."
venturebros,3apq6m,blaspheminCapn,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:16:17 2015 UTC,"It would make a great finale for the series to reveal what happened to him. Because of Jonas sr, Rusty is what he is, and if he somehow came back, Rusty might just change for the better, because as shown in ''20 years to midnight'', he still clearly loves his father and would like to have him around. If the main character stops being the cynical bastard that he is then the series would become kinda boring.  But I still think that the alien picking the form of Jonas Sr was very strange. Why would he do that? If he picked it and didn't know that the form was the father of Rusty, then why did he say ''Where you can't follow Rusty''? That means that the alien clearly knew he was taking the form of Rusty's father. If he knew that, why would he take that form just to screw with everyone's emotions?"
venturebros,3apq6m,scottmill,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:25:54 2015 UTC,"But I still think that the alien picking the form of Jonas Sr was very strange.    So the Alien makes a comment about how there's a bunch of stuff on a cosmic level that the humans don't understand.  The Galactic Inquisitor shows up at exactly the moment Brock finds an old box with a 20 year old tape with four artifacts scattered around the globe, none of which have been moved or accidentally destroyed or rendered inaccessible in the intervening 20 years?  Seriously, buried in a skyscraper's foundation, stuck in a diving bell at the bottom of the ocean, part of some guy's cane?    I'm guessing the tape's also a message from not Jonas but a recent message from the Alien who shows up at the end.  My guess would be that it's a covert mission undertaken by some aliens to execute the Galactic Inquisitor, and involving the local populace is just there for a level of plausible deniability.  Send a group of the local super scientists on a quest, then pretend the quest ended with them killing the GI: ""Oh, no, some humans made a thing and one of them shot the GI.  Nothing to do with the Alien's cosmic faction..."""

Listened to Season 1 Venture Bros Commentary and I was laughing my ass off multiple times!  I also caught that belly button thing about the boys and thought it would have been too obvious a spoiler for season 1.  They should have brought it back now like Goth Depressing Dean telling Hank;  ""You never noticed you don't have a belly button?""  I am on Season 2 commentary and right off the bat, I was laughing so hard at Doc&Jac doing Col. Gentleman, talking about fucking Kiki.  ""I want to spread him on toast.""

It says a lot more about Rust's jadedness if he thinks Orb may be a super weapon but is so tired of it all that he doesn't care; rather than not caring because he knows it doesn't work. The later is a reasonable response from just about anyone, while the first feels much more distinctly Rusty.    Aside from Rusty saying he is going to work do tests on Orb, we have no evidence that he actually did look further into it. So, I'm more inclined to believe he didn't know.

venturebros,3a0gk2,DJdekutree,4,Tue Jun 16 15:21:05 2015 UTC,"I think it hasn't worked since the time when Sandow broke it. Since then it has been sort of a family heirloom, which may in time work again (maybe). Of course Rusty tinkered with it when he brought it back. That thing just looks like $$$ to him!"
venturebros,3a0gk2,Waldo19,2,Tue Jun 16 18:59:01 2015 UTC,"Jonas didn't seem to know it didn't work, Kano didn't seem to know it didn't work, OSI didn't seem to know that it didn't work.  Why do we all suddenly believe a hack like Rusty figured it out?  Just because you can't get something to work doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't work. It may simply mean you don't know how to operate it.  I think it is much more likely that the secret of Orb died with Sandow and Col Venture.   Jonas was intently studying it, realized he couldn't solve it (get it to work) and feared it getting into the wrong hands, so he hid it and left clues for his son to find it and continue on his work. Why go through all that trouble if you know the thing doesn't work.  This scene is simply Rusty having seen this same thing 100 times before and want's these assholes off his lawn as soon as possible.  If you want to read further into it you can, but I think it is that simple.  I can't help but think if Rusty knew for a fact that Orb didn't work he would have just told everyone. Orb only appeared in 2 episodes. I think the guild politics that it revealed and hinted at are much more important than Orb itself.   Orb is a textbook mcguffin."

There was, for me at least, this feeling of finality and completion to it. Could've been just because Doc and Jackson had really nailed down the feel of the show by that point."

venturebros,39mwe3,ColeTheo,11,Fri Jun 12 21:41:20 2015 UTC,"I really have to disagree with your hope of Hank and Dean going back to being blissfully stupid, at least not without some character progression.   They have learned too much. They both know they are clones, and have gone through their own personal rebellious stages. (Hank in Season 4 when Brock left, and Dean in Season 5 after basically shedding Trianna).   Hank basically surprised Colonel Gathers and Shoreleave with his ability to evade their pranks when he “tried out” for S.P.H.I.N.X., and Brock seems to realize Hank would probably excel at a job like his own. Another redditor on this sub said Hank is basically Brock’s heir and I want to agree with that – I think Hank will follow in Brock’s footsteps. This is what I want to see happen, not completely shedding the obliviousness but I want to see progress towards this or some type of future even if I’m completely off. I think we got a glimpse of Dean embracing his future in super-science when he was helping Rusty reactivate the ray-shield on Gargantua 2, Dean being the one who actually solved the problem. He even mentions that he was impressed by the whole situation. I also cannot let go of the fact that Dean is technically the heir to the Guild of Calamitous Intent. IF, and I mean IF, Headshot actually killed the Sovereign, then I think Dean has that small chance of somehow being involved with the Guild, however that is very unlikely seeing as Killinger reformed the Council itself. This is just my own personal opinion, something I can’t seem to let go of.    I’ve also always had this image in my mind of Hank being Dean’s bodyguard – but that feels way to straightforward and simple to happen.   Yeah, I hope Season 6 is goofier, but seeing as one of the themes of the show is failure, I’m skeptical to think it wouldn’t be goofy in order to aid Rusty’s continued failure. He’s basically been given everything by JJ, just like Jonas Sr. gave him. It would only be fit to see Rusty fuck it up again, somehow, someway, even if it isn’t completely his fault.    TL;DR: I hope they show progress for Hank and Dean in regards to their futures, and I hope Rusty ends up fucking it all up somehow."
venturebros,39mwe3,Oneofmyturns000,2,Sat Jun 13 06:34:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I want Hank and Dean to continue progressing into their own distinct personalities, not regress back into their ignorant, goofy selves."
venturebros,39mwe3,aemoseley,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:38:09 2015 UTC,"I'm all for character progression, but there's something about the blissful stupidity of pre-rebellious Hank and Dean that was just really charming. But other than that, I could totally see Hank becoming Brock's heir, it was hinted at since the beginning, look at their exploits through Ünderland: Hank ""attempted"" to take out a few guards all by himself.   Other than that, I just really want to see more ""House of mummies"" type adventures from the series, it is called the ""Venture"" Bros after all."
venturebros,39mwe3,21derful,1 point,Sat Jun 13 06:52:31 2015 UTC,"There is a wonderful opportunity right now for a mix of over-the-top shenanigans with legitimate drama in the whole ""mysterious person killing off villains"" bit shown in the Season 6 trailer.  While I'm holding out on the off chance it's actually not Rusty (I mean, we have three shapeshifters already, a master of illusions, etc; it's not guaranteed to be the obvious answer by any means), if it IS him, then basically...   He's dealing vigilante justice. He's probably funding that with his huge inheritance. There's a good chance it's at least partially fueled by grief over family death. He'd literally be an awful Batman spinoff and Hank would lose all his shit."

And VERY YES to getting more villain development overall- so long as the Monarch trio still gets plenty of spotlight as well because they are my favorites (and also my OT3). With Sheila as Councilman 1 now, Gary apparently on the council, and Monarch... maybe? (It was a little unclear whether Killinger was saying he wasn't on the council at all or just that he didn't get the head chair that he'd been aiming for.) At any rate, with the new Council being what it is, it would only make sense for us to spend some time getting to know not only the familiar faces now on it (including glorious duo Watch and Ward, probably), but the newcomers (Fat Choice, Phage, etc) and whatever new recruits they have to pick up to fill the remaining seats!"

venturebros,39er5n,Capt-Murphy,5,Thu Jun 11 06:13:15 2015 UTC,"Source?  In animation (and all prior seasons of VB) voices are recorded to storyboards first, then the animation is done against the voice tracks and story boards.   Generally (based on JP's blog in past seasons) they start the season when about half of the shows are complete and delivered, and the rest have been animated. That allows time to do retakes, post production, and sound on the second half of the season while the first airs."
venturebros,39er5n,hdsrob,2,Thu Jun 11 11:36:12 2015 UTC,"At the end of the Gargantua-2 finale it has the season 6 stinger at the end, it's all new animation."

venturebros,39bcyo,TheBlackSpank,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:16:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Jackson and Doc take so long to make it that I think a comic book might be a better way to go. If they had an artist that could render that style, all they would have to worry about is writing. The voices are such a huge part of it, though, so I'm conflicted. I wish they could just find a decent team of people that they trust to help them make the show so we could get a season every year. It's one of my favorite shows ever made, but I make it a point to just ignore any Venture Bros news because I know it will just make it a more agonizing wait. I put it out of my mind until I get a premiere date."
venturebros,39bcyo,Berwhale,2,Wed Jun 10 18:25:53 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind a comic as a companion to the show but Venture Bros is the only thing on TV right now with decent animation quality. It would be a crying shame to lose that.

venturebros,39bcyo,TheBlackSpank,2,Wed Jun 10 21:27:16 2015 UTC,"Right, but if they leave it to somebody else, less work for them. The reason the show takes so long to come out is because they do everything. There are comic book artists that can probably mimic their style very easily, and do it faster, since that's the sole thing they do for a living.

Mistakes the average viewer doesn't notice bugs the crap out of them. They are probably working hard and painstakingly going over every frame looking for mistakes in the animation.

venturebros,398bbr,bamberjean,14,Wed Jun 10 03:11:49 2015 UTC,I remember Dr Killinger romanticizing over Rusty and his brother fighting. Maybe we don't have the right brothers fighting it out.
venturebros,398bbr,Sallymander,2,Wed Jun 10 05:45:30 2015 UTC,"""Clone eyebrow thing""?  EDIT: Also, it probably wouldn't be unwise to think Rusty himself is a clone. We haven't really seen him get any original ideas, he steals all of his fathers' creations. Where else could he have gotten the cloning facility for Hank and Dean?"
venturebros,398bbr,bamberjean,13,Wed Jun 10 03:29:50 2015 UTC,In the Halloween special old man Potter (he helped clone the boys (and probably others)) says a bunch of really technical things about Dean's appearance and one of the things is that clones have an excessive amount of eyebrow growth. The Monarch has the most eyebrow growth of any character I've seen.  I'm not doing a great job explaining this. Someone help.   Edit: I'm not discounting rusty being a clone but where do you get the idea that clones don't have original ideas? Look at Hank! He is a clone with tons of original ideas (take shallow gravy for staters).  Edit 2: discount what I said in my first edit. I understand what you are saying. Jonas Sr. must have certainly did some cloning before rusty. We have no idea who else he could have cloned.
venturebros,398bbr,bamberjean,9,Wed Jun 10 03:42:08 2015 UTC,...I didn't know there was a Halloween special.  I'll be right back.
venturebros,398bbr,B1GTOBACC0,16,Wed Jun 10 03:44:40 2015 UTC,Ooooooohhhhh shit! This is dope as fuck for you!!!! Congratulations friend!
venturebros,398bbr,bamberjean,2,Wed Jun 10 03:46:39 2015 UTC,"Probably the best special they've done, next to All This and Gargantua 2. It's hard to top that one."
venturebros,398bbr,bamberjean,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:50:50 2015 UTC,Well??? What did you think? Have you learned something about cloning?
venturebros,398bbr,AndrewNeo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:13:12 2015 UTC,Yup. He basically confirms that Jonas had clones made of Rusty.  Whether or not that has anything to do with The Monarch is yet to be seen.
venturebros,398bbr,minibudd,2,Thu Jun 11 07:15:22 2015 UTC,"But did you love it or what!?! I really thought it was a great special. Lots of cool cloning clues about cloning. Really pushed the plot too. Also there were some super funny jokes like when the master and the alchemist talk  Master: ""Hello, you all know me. I live in many of your closets. And guess what? You drinks have forced me out of the closet.""  Alchemist: ""You go, girl!""  Master: ""Solidarity my brother!""  I hope you liked the episode too! It makes me happy that I helped you find an episode you hadn't seen. I wish I could find an episode I haven't seen. I am just about to start watching episodes with commentary so that is sort of like watching them for the first time. Anywho what say we stop ranting and get back to doing science!  I just have to put on my speedsuit, have a scientastic day!"
venturebros,398bbr,imbcmdth,5,Fri Jun 12 05:15:33 2015 UTC,I could have sworn that it was said that cloning was one of the only things Rusty actually did himself.
venturebros,398bbr,21derful,3,Wed Jun 10 06:57:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's ever really been specified in the show, just strongly inferred by fans.  One thing the show does confirm is that everything Jonas ever did, he succeeded. Everything Rusty's ever had, he got from his father. I'm starting to wonder if the whole cloning thing was 100% Jonas' achievement but was kept under wraps because of oft-cited laws/ethics--until Rusty decided he needed it.  Also still wondering about that line in the season 5 closer. Action Man is burying Dr. Entmann/Humongoloid and says, ""First of Team Venture to go..."" Very strange, since supposedly the Venture in Team Venture died over 20 years ago. This type of TV time is expensive. This type of animation is more expensive. You don't waste time with poorly-thought-out lines. You always make sure you are 100% committed to your writing before you pay a voice artist to go into a studio and an animation studio to get to inking."
venturebros,398bbr,minibudd,3,Wed Jun 10 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"One thing the show does confirm is that everything Jonas ever did, he succeeded.   Except for the Space Shuttle thing that crashed into the ocean. And the Fallout-type nuclear shelter with M.U.T.H.E.R.   If there is one thing the show has taught us it is that Jonas was very good at was covering up his failures and widely publicizing his successes."
venturebros,398bbr,ShapeOfEvil,2,Sun Jun 14 04:27:18 2015 UTC,"That is a fantastic observation on Jonas! ..But I do have to add.  The shuttle that crashed? That was a massive, very long David Bowie reference. ... A reference that played out exactly as the story in Bowie's Space Oddity... in the same year it was released as a song... The very same song that put Bowie on the charts and into major spotlight for the first  time as an artist.  And this was shown to us long before we knew about the Sovereign.  Coincidence? Perhaps... Or perhaps not."

venturebros,398bbr,BobbyBenzobbi,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:14:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say that because Jonas Jr. had been growing inside Doc his whole life, he can't be a clone."

venturebros,398bbr,scottmill,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:16:39 2015 UTC,"The parasitic twin isn't a genetic trait.   Maybe they weren't anticipating two living things in one when they cloned Rusty, accidentally cloning both of them."
venturebros,398bbr,deusnefum,52,Wed Jun 17 06:26:16 2015 UTC,"No, you're exactly right and in my opinion they are brothers, or clones of the same person, or one is the clone of the other."
venturebros,398bbr,ProtoJMan,19,Wed Jun 10 00:07:17 2015 UTC,"That picture obviously has something to do with it. The fact that The Monarch never specifies with ""people in the background"" are his parents is driving me nuts."
venturebros,398bbr,BarkMingo,15,Wed Jun 10 00:35:35 2015 UTC,My guess is cousins; Dr. Venture Sr. and The Monarch's mother are brother and sister. That's just a guess though.
venturebros,398bbr,bamberjean,14,Wed Jun 10 02:58:42 2015 UTC,"One thing I noticed Ben says in the Halloween special is that Jonas Sr viewed cloning in the same way as Rusty, ""as nothing more than a fucking band-aid for a really big boo-boo."" Since Hank and Dean weren't born until after Jonas died, it's possible Ben knew this because Jonas cloned Rusty."
venturebros,398bbr,PunkThug,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:34:36 2015 UTC,"That might explain why Rusty is so chill with cloning his own sons.  Though considering how we've seen the old Team Venture freak out when someone harms/threatens Rusty, I don't imagine he died very often..."
venturebros,398bbr,thecatdemon,3,Wed Jun 10 08:00:09 2015 UTC,"I think Rusty was a one-off clone experiment. Or perhaps the first ""successful"" clone. So there's only the one of him. Rusty, on the other hand, saw cloning as a way to hedge his chances against losing his sons, since he, as a boy adventurer was always in deadly situations and knew his sons would likely follow in his footsteps."
venturebros,398bbr,AldusValor,4,Wed Jun 10 12:04:09 2015 UTC,"If Rusty is a clone it could explain some of the body issues he has, but that's also explainable with all the pills and meds he takes."

venturebros,398bbr,Pirateer,28,Wed Jun 10 05:30:34 2015 UTC,There's a pretty popular fan-theory that Doc and the Monarch are the titular Venture Bros.
venturebros,398bbr,AldusValor,9,Wed Jun 10 01:43:30 2015 UTC,"It's not just you. I, however, feel it's irrelevant misdirection."
venturebros,398bbr,SuperSmokingMonkey,3,Wed Jun 10 01:17:52 2015 UTC,"Just had an idea,I'm feeling pretty original here.  What if rusty was really injured or sick while he was young so Dr. Jonas sr cloned rusty in preparation of his death only to see him recover. Now with this clone baby not wanting to go to waste Jonas goes through which would explain the large eyebrow growth of the monarch(as mentioned in the Halloween special)"
venturebros,398bbr,MyKarmaKilledURDogma,3,Wed Jun 10 14:23:50 2015 UTC,I don't know if they're brothers or not but I think the pointed noses and beards are just coincidence. Those kinds of angular features work well in the VB visual style.

venturebros,398bbr,zhiryst,3,Wed Jun 10 02:17:58 2015 UTC,"I will need to track it down, although /u/SuperSmokingMonkey may get there faster, where in the commentary of one episode (it would make sense for it to be in ""Dr. Quymn, Medicine Woman"") Doc and Jackson discuss the male dominated cast and how it's difficult to have attractive women in the show that don't all look like Sally Impossible.  If I'm right, and it was that episode, those comments were made as late as season 4. Now imagine the early days of season 1 when character design limitations were greater.  I'm naturally skeptical. There's other things to consider, guys."

The Moppets had been planning a take over of the Cocoon for a long time.  The weird part about all of this is that Dr. Orpheus ""couldn't see"" 24's ghost or Mr Wendell (whom is not dead btw)  and  How Homem Da Carrinha (Brasilian?) mentioned:  How did 21 have the powers he did; like Being able to sense ""The Ether Soaked Hankerchief"" in Monstrosos Henchman's pocket or being able to infiltrate the Venture Compounds Defence's without the ghost of 24?  I always bring up the fact that anything Dr. O says can be interpreted in a million ways; he is just trying to ""Repair the Net"" or keep the Universe ""right""  So he might have been able to see 24's Ghost, but felt that 21 DID NOT NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH, so that he could become TwoTon21 and right the wrongs of The Universe and eventually take out The Moppets.   I can't explain Mr. Wendel.  (Maybe he's just manifested by 24's ghost?)"

You don't NEED a ray shield unless you purposely are going to put your station in the way of debris or other materials.  This makes me think that the destruction of the station was intentional - or at least inevitable due to J.J's dealing with the investors.  As we have seen before the investors will give you what you want but only for a short time before taking it/having it taken from you.  Examples:  King gorilla's freedom, State University's new building, etc."

That's why he would often start the show and have inside jokes with the audience. It's more than likely that James was picked during the warm up to talk to Dave, and doing so gave him enough confidence to speak up when this happened. Also I think it was taken down but James Urbaniak did an interview about this and mentioned he had seen Letterman flub the same joke the night before this taping.  Also, for anyone looking for more info this was NOT The Late Show, this was rather Late Night with David Letterman which ran on NBC. (Same show Conan, Fallon, and now Myers all had/have.)"

venturebros,38e3no,SuperSmokingMonkey,18,Wed Jun 3 16:46:26 2015 UTC,I think it's more exposure to Helper that makes them able to understand them than just being a Venture.    Dermott couldn't understand him at first until he started hanging out with Hank (and especially all the Shallow Gravy rehearsals).  Brock understands him because he spent about 20 years protecting the Venture family.

venturebros,38e3no,DJdekutree,27,Wed Jun 3 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"I think understanding H.E.L.P.eR is more of an acceptance thing than DNA driven. If H.E.L.P.eR deems you a worthy ally to the Venture clan, then he may begin to let you understand him. This would make sense as to why Brock can understand him, and why The Monarch cannot. It took H.E.L.P.eR a long time to determine if Dermott was a nuisance or an ally so that is why Dermott could not always understand him."

venturebros,38d8pc,Akatsukaii,44,Wed Jun 3 13:44:22 2015 UTC,"Just a comic book? That is Marvel #1 feat. Ka-zar the Great and 12 pages of jungle adventure! Also yes, I am pretty sure he accepted the comic book and then never cloned 24. That is why 21 comes back with the Orchard Street Wolf Pack to try and get Orpheus to do it."
venturebros,38d8pc,DJdekutree,12,Wed Jun 3 13:53:17 2015 UTC,"21 didn't put up much of a protest afterwards then, if he gave up something so valuable then I would've thought he'd atleast try to get it back, or mention it."
venturebros,38d8pc,DJdekutree,14,Wed Jun 3 14:34:50 2015 UTC,"No he really didn't. He did mention that Dr. Venture ""deceived"" him by not cloning 24 but you are right, he never tried to get the book back. I would have gone all limit-breaker with the foam battle axe if I was him. I guess Hank had ruined the value of the book by the time he came back also."
venturebros,38d8pc,aemoseley,3,Wed Jun 3 14:38:23 2015 UTC,"There is one point where Dean gives the comic book to ""Giant Boy Detective/Hitler"" and Gary asks something to the effect of ""which comic book were you reading?"" It never shows Dean's answer, but it's probably assumed that Gary finds out that the comic book is now worthless."
venturebros,38d8pc,bamberjean,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:04:05 2015 UTC,Wow I missed that! You are sharp! He surely would have recognized it immediately.
venturebros,38d8pc,stop___grammar_time,16,Fri Jun 5 18:58:47 2015 UTC,"IIRC he never agreed to clone 24. He didn't even want to take the comic book from 21 because he wouldn't believe that it was worth as much as he said it was. Dr. Venture just took it from 21 to get him to go away, then gave Hank the comic because he thought 21 was crazy and the comic was worthless."
venturebros,38d8pc,bamberjean,5,Wed Jun 3 14:12:22 2015 UTC,"21 was pretty calm about losing the comic then, it was just a pretty important part of the episode with the comic did be constantly mentioned but the actual trade it was apart of was never mentioned again and everyone was fine about it."
venturebros,38d8pc,Notalent13,3,Wed Jun 3 14:36:31 2015 UTC,"Okay I have some thoughts about this. Maybe 21 just had bigger shit to worry about. Which is saying a ton considering the value that he must have placed on that comic. It probably meant more to him than anything except for 24. Not because of the money, of course. He was so focused on saving 24 he didn't care about getting the comic back.   Or possibly 21 has a lot of other more valuable (sentimentally or otherwise) comics (I seem to recall him selling action figures on eBay for sweet gear), but he would never consider giving those up for various reasons. The comic he gave to Rusty didn't actually mean that much to him.  Definitely part of it was he was in a crazed state. He probably would have not just left the comic there if he was in his right mind, or he perhaps would have gone to Jonas or somebody more reliable than Dr. Venture. I guess nobody else has low scruples like rusty though."
venturebros,38d8pc,DJdekutree,2,Thu Jun 4 03:00:51 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say he was pretty calm considering he stole the X-1 in retaliation for his comic being destroyed. We just never see his actual outburst of anger.
venturebros,38d8pc,bamberjean,10,Thu Jun 4 06:47:21 2015 UTC,"I don't think Rusty believed 21 about how much that book was worth. Rusty cares about money more than anything, if he actually knew it was CGC rated 10.0 then he would have never let Hank have it. He is still a dick, but a mostly oblivious one."
venturebros,38d8pc,lvl_35_ice_troll,2,Wed Jun 3 16:09:52 2015 UTC,Your first paragraph is true but the second can't possibly be true. Rusty doesn't know about comic books. He also doesn't really care about 21 or 24. I'd bet he never thinks about them (let alone their relationship to each other)  unless it directly concerns him. (I'm having a hard time remembering other important interactions they've had prior to this one)
venturebros,38d8pc,SuperSmokingMonkey,0,Wed Jun 3 16:12:01 2015 UTC,"Well for starters, you should have said ""In my mind, Rusty KNEW how much both that comic book and 24 meant to 21."""
venturebros,38d8pc,DJdekutree,10,Wed Jun 3 19:17:48 2015 UTC,"The Rusty, being too ignorant on the value of certain comics, didn't understand he had Half a million dollar chip in his hand.  He never really said ""yes"" to 21, he stated later on that he couldn't clone anymore because Nazi's and the OSI were on his ass.  Had he gotten $500,000 for the comic I bet he would of cloned a whole army of 24's.  21 losing the ""priceless family heirloom"" was another part of his old self being completely broken down, so that he could become something greater.  Two-Ton21 has become the phoenix, the comic and losing 24 is the ash.  At least that's what I imagine is going on in Gary's head.  He will always be Gary,  he will be cosplaying as a Jedi come December."

Did Dr. O lie to Gary because he didn't want to resurrect a ""bad guy""?"
venturebros,38d8pc,aemoseley,2,Thu Jun 4 00:14:23 2015 UTC,"He can't use his resurrection powers all willy-nilly, and it's not like he's responsible for 24 like he was Hank and Dean.

Kano probably came very close to killing Jonas Sr. but then backed down, just like Brock.Its the only reason why Orb would have still been in Jonas Sr. possession allowing him to hide it and allowing the cycle of the body guards to continue."
venturebros,385kza,Waldo19,3,Tue Jun 2 16:32:36 2015 UTC,Didn't Kano know that the orb didn't work? So there would be no reason for him to kill Jonas Sr.
venturebros,385kza,Buttock,3,Tue Jun 2 17:28:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. IIRC Col Venture tells Sando, lets keeps this a secret. Which implies that Neither Jonas nor Rusty know that Orb is dud. In fact everyone seems to think ORB is very much a real threat.   The fact that Gathers sends Brock after Rusty suggests that OSI doesn't even know its a dud. But with Kano's vow of silence, I suppose it is possible that he knows but never told anyone. But if that were the case, you'd think he'd tell Brock. Kano seems honorable and I would have a hard time envisioning him allowing Brock to run off and kill Rusty if he knew ORB posed no threat. However, If he thought ORB was functional then I think that same honor code would force him to let Brock kill the boy he protected for so long."
venturebros,385kza,Waldo19,3,Tue Jun 2 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"No, Rusty knows the ORB is a dud.  If you watch the episode when Phantom Limb tries to activate it everyone is freaking out except Rusty who has his usual bored/annoyed look on his face."

venturebros,385kza,wise_idiot,9,Tue Jun 2 01:57:04 2015 UTC,My guess is that Rusty is Monarch's half brother. Jonas had an affair with her and baby Rusty was born. Knowing Jonas it's entirely plausible that he was a welcomed third wheel and the Monarch's parents were in to swinging.
venturebros,385kza,satisfried,8,Tue Jun 2 12:30:32 2015 UTC,"This actually makes a lot of sense. Coupled with Ven-Data as Monarch's real father, it just adds onto how much of a dick Jonas really was."

And it may not be that Jona's was being a dick, he may have been trying to simply resurrect his lost friend.

venturebros,385kza,SirSpaceCat,5,Tue Jun 2 20:48:22 2015 UTC,"Up until Season 5 there were really 3 major questions that really NEEDED to be answered for a proper conclusion to the Venture lore.  1) Why does the Monarch Hate Venture?  2) How did Jonas Sr. Die or, if he is not dead, where has he been?  3) Who is the Boy's real mother(s)?  Following ""SPHINX Rising"" there is now a 4 th crucial question:  4) What is the connection between The Monarch's Parents and Jonas Venture.  Just my 2 cents, but I think all other questions are secondary to or derivative of these 4 big ones. For example, finding out who is Rusty's mother in and of itself doesn't matter, UNLESS it ties into one of these bigger questions. If she is just some girl Jonas banged and threw away, then knowing that doesn't change much. But if knowing her identity sheds light on Rusty's relationship with the Monarch or where Jonas Sr. has been, than it is very very important."

I never gave venture bros. another chance after the pilot.   So when they marathoned  S1 the night of the premier, and I managed to catch the end of S1 where they get blown away.  I was like ""wtf isn't season 2 starting tonight"". Needless to say that episode sucked me into what is now my favorite animated series."
venturebros,37j1fr,Stumpy_grump,1 point,Thu May 28 14:29:53 2015 UTC,Season 3 is like Revolver.  Season 4 is Sgt. Pepper's. I can't choose a favorite they're both beautiful and lead up to each other perfectly

venturebros,36qcxz,SuperSmokingMonkey,9,Thu May 21 14:38:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't really notice it before but you're right the mask does almost resemble butterfly wings. Perhaps it is The Monarch and 21 going on a revenge spree after not joining the council? But then again with all the new money acquired from JJ it could be Dr. Venture! Possibly with Hatred? Doesn't make sense for it to be Brock. But in this theory it does kinda make sense, Venture has money now. Also a new hideout, perfect time to start a new persona if you ask me."

venturebros,36qdzb,buddhajack28,28,Fri May 22 00:43:07 2015 UTC,"In one episode, I forget the title, brock is threatening someone and says that the ventures were his family so he probably feels close to/responsible for them."
venturebros,36qdzb,ashleton,3,Thu May 21 11:15:03 2015 UTC,"I know what you're talking about, but I can't place it right off the top of my head. Even though Rusty is a little older, Brock is more like the big brother looking out for his little brother.  Edit: Oh wait, I do remember now. Brock said that to Phantom Limb when he was showing off for Dr. Girlfriend during the time she and The Monarch split up."
venturebros,36qdzb,Servb0t,20,Thu May 21 11:27:32 2015 UTC,"The episode you're referring to is Victor Echo November. Brock also displays his love for the Ventures other times, most notably in The Family That Slays Together, Stays Together 1&2"
venturebros,36qdzb,Willie_Main,29,Thu May 21 12:43:13 2015 UTC,I'd say they're friends in the same way me and a guy I know in the marines are friends. We're polar opposites in just about every way but we've been through a lot together and there are ways we help each other that aid us in continuing to be friends.
venturebros,36qdzb,supermelon928,10,Thu May 21 08:59:53 2015 UTC,"Well, there's that episode where Brock puts his mission aside to get Rusty off that death wheel thing.    [edit] Bot Seeks Bot."

venturebros,36qdzb,cowi3,4,Fri May 22 13:28:26 2015 UTC,"If they weren't full blown friends to begin with, they've definitely developed a friendship over the years due to being in such close proximity to each other. They've shown montages where they grow mustaches together, Brock has vehemently protected all members of the family as best he can, and Rusty trusts Brock more than most people.  If you can't call it friendship, then it's definitely mutual affection of some sort."
venturebros,36qdzb,TwistedBlister,2,Thu May 21 16:12:05 2015 UTC,Brock and doc show brah!
venturebros,36qdzb,Cherry_Doll_Face,1 point,Thu May 21 09:16:14 2015 UTC,"We haven't really seen anything about Brock's early life, but I imagine that part of joining the OSI he had to break all contact with his family, so I think that the Ventures have become sort of a surrogate family for him. But even though he loves all of them, there have been several times where Brock humors Doc's quirks, and at best tolerates him."
venturebros,36qdzb,NovaStarLord,1 point,Thu May 21 20:45:32 2015 UTC,"Brock definitely thinks of the Ventures as his own family. He's said this a couple of times. Even after leaving his bodyguard position, he still looked out for them and cared about them.   As for them being friends, I'd like to think they are. I mean, how could you be that close to someone for so long and not develop a friendship. Either way, it's obvious they care about each other."
venturebros,36qdzb,Lots42,1 point,Thu May 21 23:30:35 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he was just a job for Brock at the beginning but he spent years and years with the Venture family and it's pretty clear in the show that he cares for him and they've hanged out together.  Of course Rusty is kind of an SOB and Brock knows that too (the guy used parts of an orphan child to make a machine) and he isn't too keen on how Rusty treats his sons sometimes (who Brock is really attached to since he watched them grow since they were babies and he really protects them) and part of why he quit being Rusty's bodyguard was because Rusty sent an army of Hank and Dean clone slugs to fight to their death and he watched them get blown into pieces.
venturebros,36qdzb,CircularMatrix,-2,Fri May 22 00:01:18 2015 UTC,"Quite possibly Brock saves Rusty only because it would make Hank and Dean sad if the goober dies.   And Rusty has his value. Brock's friends ran the worldwide peacekeeping group out of Rusty's backyard. He keeps that circle of magicians in line somehow. And Billy Quizboy worships Rusty and that scary looking weirdo has value.  Edit: Also, Brock had to save Rusty so much that he continues to do so in order to keep up his reputation with people who aren't complete loser weirdos."

venturebros,36mw29,GratefullyGodless,1 point,Thu May 21 21:19:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with Tag Sale because it features most of the major characters and offers some degree of characterization on all of them, sets the setting tone pretty well, and occurs early enough in the series that one won't miss too much if they start off right there."

Turns out the highest rated episodes so far are:    Showdown at Cremation Creek Pt 2 Ghosts of the Sargasso, Twenty Years to Midnight, The Family that Slays Together Slays Together pts 1 & 2, Blood of the Father, Heart of Steel    I agree with most of the people here who are saying to stay with seasons 1 and 2, so I'd go with the first three I have listed + Showdown at Cremation Creek Pt 1."

You can't just slap some text on any photo and have it achieve the status of meme.  First it must be accepted by the community as a whole and the only way for it to do this is too reach saturation and become part of the vocabulary of the culture.  A meme is only a meme is everyone knows it's a meme.  That doesn't mean you can't create a new meme it just means you can't anoint anything a meme that must happen organically from the community.

While we can debate whether or not the cost of success was worth the outcome we can't argue that he didn't earn it.  Teddy may currently score higher on the scale of happiness, but for how long?  The fact remains that By-Golly Gulch is in desperate need of infrastructure spending in order to maintain its rainbow slides and honey rivers.  These things don't grow on gumdrop trees, unlike gumdrops.    Teddy and friends have spent their entire lives living for the moment and have ignored their fiscal responsibilities.  With the current economy in shambles they're headed for a fall.  History has consistently demonstrated that it's people like Grumpy Bandersnatch that will survive the economic woes which will absolutely bury those who have failed to keep a keen eye on the markets.  Sure, he may be Grumpy Bandersnatch now, but tomorrow he'll likely have the last laugh and those gumdrop trees will be festooned with the swinging corpses of those who failed to plan for their future."

There is the possibility that the infrastructure may receive an injection of fresh blood once the market for gumdrops picks up.  And we all know that By-Golly gulch is the premier provider of gum drops and gum drop related products and has the market essentially cornered.  I foresee good things for By-Golly Gulch, but only if those lazy denizens can be bothered to stay out of the honey river and get their shit together."

If Rusty is responsible for his Toys creating the problem then his urine is surely to blame for bringing down G-1. In a way, I think Rusty's lack of attention is Phantom Spaceman.

venturebros,35lu5t,theforkofdamocles,1 point,Mon May 11 18:01:11 2015 UTC,"More on Phantom Spaceman  http://teamventure.org/vbwiki/Phantom_Spaceman  Before he was Phantom Spaceman, he was an employee aboard the Gargantua-1 space station. He became disgruntled, but hid this from his co-workers. He invited the crew to a screening of the movie Sharky's Machine. A large number of the crew attended (Sharky's Machine!) and the man who became Phantom Spaceman opened the bay doors to space, killing most of the crew and himself. He is said to now roam the station as a Phantom Spaceman.  It is generally accepted that Phantom Spaceman is a big fat jerk!  It is also believed that he isn't real but instead just a story made up by Bud Manstrong to entertain the boys (although it ended up scaring them instead).  Hank and Dean originally believed Lt. Anna Baldavich to be the phantom spaceman upon witnessing Brock ""wrestling"" with her. But once her helmet came off they realized he was still on the loose. Upon H.E.L.P.eR.'s return to the station he was covered in blankets and a bucket. The boys then mistook him as the phantom spaceman, and proceeded to kick and punch him and eject him out of the station.  We all know that the picture shown is H.e.l.p.e.r with a bucket on his head (also seen in my Little Big Planet Level http://www.reddit.com/r/venturebros/comments/35bu8f/check_out_my_little_big_planet_venture_brothers/)  If we believe that Bud Manstrong was just trying to scare the boys, then Yes; he is not a character and should be stricken from The List  If we believe that these events actually happened during Movie Night, then there IS a character that was mentioned and not shown yet.

venturebros,35cn2r,AldusValor,2,Mon May 11 07:16:37 2015 UTC,"@ Dipper_In_The_TARDIS  This is your answer,  It was very confusing as Blood of the Father Heart of Steel is backwards, and you have to go even further back as AldusValor did into Family Slays to find the answer.  Uncle Vatred even states, ""I think the Monarch's Boys did that"""
venturebros,35cn2r,SuperSmokingMonkey,2,Mon May 11 17:05:41 2015 UTC,"Yup. My guess is that Gary and the Orchard Street Wolf Pack were on their way to do whatever the hell when Doc summoned the X-1 to return using it's ""homing auto-pilot function.""    Doc, living the life he lived, can't tell the difference between harmless costumed idiots, and the Monarch's harmless costumed idiots. This is evidenced by Doc ordering Hatred to kill them, which Hatred is reluctant to do."
venturebros,35cn2r,AldusValor,2,Mon May 11 17:44:27 2015 UTC,"My guess is the Monarch's henchmen, or what was left of them, took the X-1 sometime after the events of The Family That Stays Together.... Probably would have been easy to make off with it especially with Brock gone and Doc in hot water with the OSI for his cloning work (meaning, he probably wasn't paying attention to whether it was there or not)."

Col Gentlemen in ATAG2 is a great example - at one point he was left for dead in the early seasons.

I also love how naive The Monarch and Rusty are;  The Monarch doesn't own ANY clothing except his Monarch suit!

What the show does best is take really ridiculous characters from old nerdy things, parody them, and then take those parodies and make them into unique well written characters.

To date, there has not been an episode (for my money) funnier than ""Are You There, God? It's Me, Dean."" This had the best blend of plot, (absentee) action, and absurdity in the series.     Monarch: Shit! It's your father! Get these corpses out of here!     Fucking classic.    Sure, the animation was all wonky. Compare the hospital room in ""Return to Spider-Skull Island"" to the hallway in ""The Incredible Mr. Brisby."" There were some scenes that were visually stunning, and others that were downright golden-age comic book-y. As mentioned in the commentary in ""Victor. Echo. November,"" you often could play the old ""Scooby-Doo, which door is gonna open?"" game.

venturebros,33qe1c,SuperSmokingMonkey,13,Fri Apr 24 17:27:43 2015 UTC,"I think the largest piece of evidence supporting the death of Jonas Venture is this one little line from Season 1:     Doc: Look who's telling me this, my dead, twelve-foot father... (Careers in Science)     Venture is alone in this scene. He knows he's alone and speaking to an hallucination of his father. He has no reason to lie here, or to coverify for some sort of ""official story.""    Jonas, likely, is dead. Rusty has seen the body, Team Venture has seen the body. There was a funeral and everything. It was in the news.  I actually believe that the cause of Jonas Venture's death is actually something mundane, like a heart attack or stroke, even if Brock (ORB) and The Monarch (Shadowman 9: In the Cradle of Destiny) think he was murdered. Jonas was also a smoker. Which would also be a reason why it isn't brought up.  In Twenty Years to Midnight, Rusty, in that moment, probably felt that Jonas faked his death, but then     Doc: ... showing up as my dead fucking father...     Most probably, The Action Man always looked at old Jonas as the leader, and not part of Team Venture."
venturebros,33qe1c,AldusValor,3,Fri Apr 24 21:32:15 2015 UTC,"Very good points, I especially liked the mundane death for Jonas Sr. idea!  The only real retort for this would be, in Pass Tense:  Before Brock gets sent off to join OSI, He is the one to tell Rusty ""Your Dad died.""  We know that there is an ""Invisible Hand of Fate"" that controls the VB universe.  Usually characters are told certain pieces of information at certain times purposely as to guide them.  Billy's a perfect example.    Isn't it strange that the moment Brock is ""joining the army"" (actually OSI because ""they"" know of his skills) he is the one that was told by Venture Industries to ""tell Rusty his Dad died.""  I think Jonas Sr is in Space somewhere < 2 cents"

Is it really not possible that a man with Jonas' superior intelligence, a man who dabbled in clone research, created his own space station, built an entire underground nuclear fallout zone with an automated supercomputer, could do something as simple as fake his own death? Now I'm not saying that I believe that Jonas is still alive or dead because I feel like there's a lot about Jonas that Doc and Jackson still haven't told us, I'm simply saying that a man of Jonas Venture's intelligence could easily fake his own death and make it look so real that even his own son would believe it.   This is part of the reason why The Venture Bros. is a such a great series. There's simply no way to tell one way or the other because they have dropped so many subtle hints over the years that Jonas' death may not be as cut and dried as originally led to believe."

Gentleman, not ActionMan, not Rusty, no one. I don't think this is accidental - certainly there are missing spaces like time between the Orb and Jonas' Team Venture days, but they aren't components of the current storyline, not in a necessary sense anyway. I think it's been saved for the upcoming seasons and will get parceled out in bits like all the rest of the Venture history, it's too deliberate of an omission to be an accident. But for speculation's sake... Look at world events from around the era, too (when did Rusty leave State, anyway?) and you have oil embargo, Iran with hostages, introduction of personal computers, Russians in Afghanistan, Cold War escalation, and a whole bunch of things that Venture would undoubtedly be involved in, and Rusty would be completely unprepared to handle - as the Cold War dies down in the mid-80's undoubtedly Venture Industries would (and did) tank, too.  [–]SuperSmokingMonkey 1 point 2 days ago  I don't think Jonas Sr. ""died"" as much as he ""left"" I base that on the fact that Rusty didn't freak out about Jonas showing up in 20 Years to Midnight. He asked were he has been, instead of asking ""how did you come back from the dead"" I do think this will be very relevant in season 6! can't wait!  [–]no_soul_ginger 2 points 2 days ago  I think that can be chalked up to Rusty being stuck on Denial as part of the grieving process, more than anything else. That and he'd been hallucinating him and having graphic dreams about his father for the whole series...Rusty is also notoriously difficult to shock. I don't buy into the Kano-kills-Jonas theory, I think that perhaps Kano is holding onto a lot of guilt surrounding Jonas' disappearance, and might actually believe him dead. In the Ventureverse, I'm pretty sure Jonas Sr. is frozen somewhere.  No Soul Ginger and I had some thoughts earlier, what do you guys think?"
venturebros,33qe1c,mike_incognito44,5,Fri Apr 24 17:32:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not so certain that Kano actually killed Dr. Venture Senior. Remember in the episode ORB, Brock goes to see Kano when he's trying to find Rusty and the second cylinder to the Victor Talking Machine, and he finds out that Kano is no longer holding to his vow of silence. He says that he killed a great man and that's why he took the vow, but in the 60s, while Dr. Venture was still alive, Kano never spoke. So, if he took the vow of silence because he killed a great man, that man was not Dr. Venture.   Kano may have still killed Dr. Venture since he never confessed to it when Brock asked. Nothing is certain in that regard.  I just wanted to throw this out there.  Surely I'm not the only one who noticed this."

venturebros,33ni73,cowboyvenus,10,Fri Apr 24 18:06:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is an especially reasonable outlook.  People constantly compare Netflix to Hulu, as if the two services are genuinely comparable.  They're not.  Hulu pulls massive amounts of viewers from cable television.  Why?  Because most people go there to watch new television shows.  If there's an episode of your favorite show, there's a good chance it'll be on Hulu the next day, where you can watch it at your leisure, pause, fast forward, rewind, etc.  DVRs can do these things too, but anecdotally, I know many people who've transitioned almost completely from watching stuff on TV to using Hulu, especially once Hulu apps became available for consoles/smart TVs/rokus/etc.  It may have commercials, but it has less commercials than television, at least last time I checked, which was about six months ago.  Netflix does not do this.  Why not?  Because people do not use Netflix to watch new television shows.  They use Netflix to watch back seasons of old television shows (or current ones airing later seasons).  They also use it to watch movies that have come out on DVD.  In this sense, Netflix has not in any significant way replaced cable television other than maybe reruns or eating up a lot of people's allotted free time in general.  What it has replaced are video stores, or other outlets people used to utilize for movies and entire seasons of television.  One of these things, therefore, entails considerably more licensing difficulties than the other.  Hulu has to negotiate content deals with the major networks producing these television shows, who are more than aware of the fact that people watching Hulu are people who aren't watching their networks, and consequently aren't contributing to their advertising revenue.  I'm sure this is factored into their negotiations.  It's easy to call them greedy, and maybe that does play a part, but I strongly suspect that they wouldn't be able to stop airing advertisements even if they wanted to.  I'd also be surprised if that money went exclusively to Hulu.  I would also imagine that the tendency to repeat the same advertisement over and over (which, don't get me wrong, is awful) has something to do with how many companies they have purchasing their advertising slots relative to traditional outlets like ABC or NBC, as well as how those companies feel about who is watching Hulu and whether the service is an effective means of reaching their target demographics, because I can virtually guarantee you there are meaningful differences in demographics among Hulu viewers vs. cable viewers.  On topic: It is kind of a bummer that it won't all be on Netflix, though.  I try to get some friends to watch it sometimes, and when they ask if it's on Netflix, I'm always like ""S... sort of."""

venturebros,33djiy,chrisk018,4,Tue Apr 21 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"big time.  i randomly youtubed it on a whim when someone mentioned the show and i got curious, and came across the scene where steven's father and amethyst are in the storage space.  it seemed like something worth checking out.  what sealed the deal was the cookie cat theme song in episode one.  like... just an ordinary theme, and then all of a sudden, inexplicably tragic past.  ""he left his family behind,"" and the whole change in steven's tone as he sings it and you're seeing this cat sobbing in a spaceship.  it was just really kind of an absurd degree of depth in the characterization of an ice cream mascot.  i thought it was hilarious.  turns out, i'm a huge fan!  there's a certain sweet innocence to steven's character, but also to the cast/town as a whole.  at the same time, though, it manages to engage with some pretty heavy themes without reducing them to nothing or seeming too grim.  it ends up exploring a lot of issues relating to loss and grief in a way that acknowledges how painful they can be while still maintaining an air of hopefulness.  also, the whole thing begins in medias res, and i really like that rather than patronizing their viewers with sloppy exposition, they just kind of hint at things very organically over long periods of time.  one episode will have a significant bit of character development, and the next will be some silly stuff where steven gets trapped in a trunk or something -- it all feels really natural.  like, they're not explaining things to viewers, just letting them see and figure out for themselves.  the relationships are also believable.  how steven relates to the other crystal gems and his father is, i would say, really convincing and touching even.  his four caretakers sort of manage to provide a nontraditional but functional parenting environment for him, and since i've been watching the show, there's been a genuine sense of development for him and his relationships with the other major characters.  it's also full of homages/references that make it very clear the creators have spent their lives being in love with animation as a medium."

Venture Brothers harnesses that with a harsh self-reflective lens that skewers the viewer by saying. ""You are 24, 21, or Rusty literally 99% of us are these characters, waiting our chance to be super-villians or super-heroes without actually doing anything for it.""

They are losers, because of wasted misguided potential and / or selfishness. Only when they are perfectly honest with themselves that the earnestness shines though for me.   I guess with SU, they quirk and earnestness comes off a bit to 'twee' and heavy handed.  I think this would be it, or at least, as close as I can explain at the moment.

Then there's that prisoner of war they held for longer than the history of written word.  Then there was the near drowning of two children.  And one of the main guardians of the show was clearly an abandoned child/accident.  And another minor character straight tried to murder a supporting character.

venturebros,331qlo,AldusValor,2,Sat Apr 18 17:57:01 2015 UTC,"Could have strangled a 15-16 year old Rusty in '76, and rather than try being his therapist again, Jonas decided to run Rusty through the memory wipe.  Venturion was an OSI project, yes?  Maybe the decision was out of Jonas' hands, Rusty's seen too much.  Kind of a command decision that gets a certain OSI Col. in the track for General, you know?"
venturebros,331qlo,no_soul_ginger,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:22:51 2015 UTC,"@ AldusValor  This seems like a good possibility, if we assume this traumatic near death experience of being strangled by Venturion happened to Rusty at 16.  Because we wouldn't have to take any cryogenic  or multiple models theories and the best part of this theory IMO:  Hank and Dean's Clone Slugs are kept at 16 years of age!  Jonas Sr found that at 16 the ""boys"" tend to die, especially at this curious age!  Good job No Soul Ginger!"
venturebros,331qlo,SuperSmokingMonkey,3,Tue Apr 21 15:38:06 2015 UTC,"When there's an intricate storyline and complex plot, the simplest reasons and motivations for character actions are often the most plausible and most humorous.  This is why I lose interest in popular drama series - they throw in an unnecessarily complicated twist that runs contrary to history or character, and I lose all suspension of disbelief immediately.  That's why Venture Bros. has kept me for so long...they've done an exceptional job in keeping true.  Could explain the gap in Rusty's apparent memory - we don't really see anything of Rusty from adolescence (around 12, right?) to his college years.  That would be '73-ish to '78-ish.  I'll bet that the bugs are mostly worked out by now, but even the boys get buggy after too many wipes."
venturebros,331qlo,no_soul_ginger,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:27:19 2015 UTC,"Well said, the whole entertainment business gets tainted by yearly releases.  See Music to Movie to Video Games business. Bands top out after their 1st or 2nd album, the movie business is stuck to one model and has resorted to looking to comics for any inspiration.  Now video games are suffering from this,  Every year people complain about Call of Duty, yet they buy them up by the millions?!  There has never been an image of Rusty between maybe the ages of 9-19 (Young Rusty in Spanakopita to College Rusty in Pass Tense) (? anyone confirm this)  This has to be a very telling time in the VB timeline.  AldusValors' Timeline has A LOT of players and events happening between 1975 and 1985.  It contains one of THE biggest questions nagging at our brains:  What happened to Jonas Sr."
venturebros,331qlo,SuperSmokingMonkey,2,Tue Apr 21 17:02:54 2015 UTC,"It's equally telling that no one talks about the circumstances of Jonas' presumed disappearance, not Col. Gentleman, not ActionMan, not Rusty, no one. I don't think this is accidental - certainly there are missing spaces like time between the Orb and Jonas' Team Venture days, but they aren't components of the current storyline, not in a necessary sense anyway.  I think it's been saved for the upcoming seasons and will get parceled out in bits like all the rest of the Venture history, it's too deliberate of an omission to be an accident.  But for speculation's sake...  Look at world events from around the era, too (when did Rusty leave State, anyway?) and you have oil embargo, Iran with hostages, introduction of personal computers, Russians in Afghanistan, Cold War escalation, and a whole bunch of things that Venture would undoubtedly be involved in, and Rusty would be completely unprepared to handle - as the Cold War dies down in the mid-80's undoubtedly Venture Industries would (and did) tank, too."
venturebros,331qlo,no_soul_ginger,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:14:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think Jonas Sr. ""died"" as much as he ""left""  I base that on the fact that Rusty didn't freak out about Jonas showing up in 20 Years to Midnight.  He asked were he has been, instead of asking ""how did you come back from the dead""  I do think this will be very relevant in season 6! can't wait!"
venturebros,331qlo,SuperSmokingMonkey,2,Tue Apr 21 20:18:07 2015 UTC,"I think that can be chalked up to Rusty being stuck on Denial as part of the grieving process, more than anything else.  That and he'd been hallucinating him and having graphic dreams about his father for the whole series...Rusty is also notoriously difficult to shock.  I don't buy into the Kano-kills-Jonas theory, I think that perhaps Kano is holding onto a lot of guilt surrounding Jonas' disappearance, and might actually believe him dead.    In the Ventureverse, I'm pretty sure Jonas Sr. is frozen somewhere."
venturebros,331qlo,no_soul_ginger,2,Tue Apr 21 23:58:54 2015 UTC,"As I started talking about in the other thread, I think the ""earlier models"" theory is the best. Maybe he was an overqualified cyborg butler for a while, until Jonas decided to turn him into something more marketable to the military.  I like #3 as well."

venturebros,32o1gt,Am_Fah,25,Wed Apr 15 09:47:58 2015 UTC,"I would guess that they are saying ""I can't get a bead on him"".   draw / get a bead on, to take careful aim at: The marksman drew a bead on his target."
venturebros,32o1gt,FoKFill,3,Wed Apr 15 13:03:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I remembered the keep away apart, but not the beam. OP had written it that way, and I just assumed what it was from the context. Bead makes more sense."
venturebros,32o1gt,Am_Fah,11,Wed Apr 15 13:59:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification! Now I finally understand the Joke.
venturebros,32o1gt,AldusValor,5,Wed Apr 15 10:21:06 2015 UTC,"This joke always bothered me. Consider this: you never really decide to get together a play keep away with your friends. The person you play keep away with, at least when typically using this phrase, is the person you're keeping something from. ""I played keep away with that nerd..."" The victim of a game of keep away typically doesn't see it as a game to be played, but in this example, the spastic is the one keeping something away, in this case, the All Seeing Eye.  Further, there typically isn't any aiming in keep away, unless it's like extreme keep away with rifles or shotguns or crossbows or something and the game is played for keeps (sorry, had to.)    So, now we have a bullying game, where the roles are reversed, the spastic is keeping the ball away from the bullies. Unless Torrid is the bully and Orpheus is the spastic, which wouldn't make sense because he's the one saying the damned line, or Torrid is both the bully and the spastic, which if you've ever been a kid, you would know is impossible.    Am I over thinking a joke that made me laugh super hard the first time I heard it? Absolutely I am, but that's what I do."
venturebros,32o1gt,SuperSmokingMonkey,3,Wed Apr 15 18:44:28 2015 UTC,"You're right the line should have been;  ""It's like playing 'TAG' with the neighborhood spastic, I can't get a bead on him!""  or Doc&Jac can just keep writing gold their own way, and we will love it and pick through every little line, and form our own theories about everything and anything.  Maybe Dr. O was that nerd, and his bully just happened to be spry as hell?"

venturebros,32npy3,depiff,5,Wed Apr 15 10:53:45 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, but I think you might be on to something.  I don't think that Sovereign is an investor, but he could be the same type of elemental being.  I've read that the investors names are names of Norse winds, so maybe Sovereign's origins are similar."

venturebros,32npy3,AldusValor,4,Wed Apr 15 13:33:10 2015 UTC,"In spite of the Venture wiki's authority on the subject matter, the names given by Killinger are the names of the Greek deities, the Romans had their own names,  and given 21 drawing the distinction between centurions and hoplites in ""Any Which Way but Zeus,"" I feel it's important to draw a distinction, here as well.    Now, expanding on this line of thought, Lips, Kaikias, and Skeiron (with Apeliotes being the fourth and last of the tempest winds) were lesser deities created by the god Typhon, and we're wicked and violent, as well as seen as male counterparts to harpies. These deities were also rarely cited, which is just another example of Doc and Jackson sometimes making us dig motherfucking deep to get a reference. They are probably most famously depicted in Homer's Oddessy as horses locked in the stable of Aeolus. The other four heavenly winds were not kept imprisoned.    Now the question is ""were the Investors and incarnation if these deities?"" Killinger does refer to them as ""brothers"" which could conceivably make him the fourth of the tempest winds. If so, how did the Sovereign intend to kill a god, let alone three? Next why would woke deities be content to make Faustian deals?  Further,  no matter how nebulous Killinger's motives ever are, I wouldn't describe them as wicked nor violent. I always see him as making people out to be the very best that they can be. He loves his job, and his job is to strengthen those that he meets. Reuniting The Monarch and Dr. Girlfriend made them stronger together than they ever were apart. Solidifying this union by performing their wedding, or attempting to. Showing Venture the path he was heading down in Season three. Honing and mastering the Revenge Society's skills throughout season 5. Good or evil, Killinger's motives seem to be making his clients the best that they can be. He's kinda like Chef Gordon Ramsey in that he doesn't care if it's used for good or evil as long as you fucking season it, you stupid fucking cow! Also, Killinger never exhibited any of shapeshifting powers of the other three, unless you count the time he was Jonas Venture's dick. But this was a hallucination, so I don't.  Given all this, just what we're they? I have no idea. I see them as some sort of magic entity that were named after the tempest wind dieties. They're dead now, so it won't be until season 12 that we get an answer."

venturebros,3225kf,bvhj,3,Fri Apr 10 12:48:57 2015 UTC,I doubt 24 would have been as competent a henchman as 21 turned out to be. So The Monarch's arching operation wouldn't be running as smoothly. 24 also probably wouldn't have joined SPHINX and befriended Sgt. Vatred.
venturebros,3225kf,yoduh4077,4,Fri Apr 10 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"If season 6 turns out to have more standalone, less arc-heavy episodes (or even with them anyway), it would be a cool thing to have a special pretty much like the What-If machine episodes from Futurama, just rejiggered into being a machine that lets them view alternate dimensions/realities/timelines, or whatever they are.  Now I have thoughts in my head of something almost like Mystery Science Theater, where the current venture clan provides running commentary on the antics of their alternate universe brethren...  That might be too meta and silly, though. Simplicity might work better in this case (ie, a straight-up direct depiction, maybe with a title card mentioning it's in ""Universe 32-L"" or whatever)"

venturebros,3225kf,quantumzak,3,Fri Apr 10 14:28:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, I just want to see an episode with Rusty Venture boy adventurer going out with Team Venture. Doc gets the rights to the show and releases a super BluRay edition or something to get some money*. He's doing the commentary or at a promotion event and starts telling 'The Real Story' behind one of the episodes and it gets super weird really fast. It would not only be a great way to fold in more history and lore, but they could go super meta about the difficulties of making and marketing an animated show or interacting with a rabid fan-base.  Bonus points if they do the flashbacks in the old Hannah Barbera style. Double Bonus points if he rides the pterodactyl.   Even without the alternate universe and kid JJ this would be great.  *I know he's got JJ's inheritance now, but I expect him to blow through that pretty quickly, if not by the start of the first episode at least by the end of this season.

I think he would not have spent all that time saying goodbye to the Venture clan if he had plans to harvest organs from them and keep living."
venturebros,320xy5,DJdekutree,2,Thu Apr 9 21:18:05 2015 UTC,"Yikes. OK. Firstly, I believe I would put JJ in the Chaotic Neutral range, so that's the framework within which I'm forming this opinion.    Literally everything JJ has ever done since the moment of his first breath has been about honoring the memory of Jonas, with a minor in family values.    -Attempted murder of Rusty (Return to Spider-Skull Island) He was meant to be the son of ""the late, great Jonas Venture."" While he was pissed (and rightfully so) at Rusty for absorbing him in the womb, the bulk of his speech was about restoring the Venture name to its former glory.    -Meeting the fake Jonas (20 Years to Midnight) there is a brief moment here where the pride and the hubris, however well deserved, is gone, and we're left with a very human and emotional moment from JJ.    -Now Museum, Now You Don't + The Lepidopterists: JJ built a friggin' museum dedicated to Jonas, and the heartfelt film about never meeting his father even warmed the hearts of all the brawlers during a god damned melee.    -The entirety of Seasons 4 and 5 were spent building a motherfucking space station in his father's honor. This is debatable, though. G2 might have been more about surpassing Jonas, but the fact remains, JJ is dead set and determined to make the Venture name mean something again.    There's also tons of lines and moments throughout Seasons 2 and 3 that suggest that aside from that little incident in the lab, JJ really cares about Rusty, and his entire family. ""But we're the Venture brothers!"" As well as all the loans.    This all indicates to me that there are only two things that JJ cares about, and they form the basis for his every motivation. Restoring the family name, and keeping his family safe. Do even though he did try to kill Rusty once, I doubt he would try again as it wouldn't further either of those goals, and would in fact go against both of them."
venturebros,320xy5,AldusValor,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:10:47 2015 UTC,"You make good and accurate points, but he was still only honoring his, and Rusty's father, Rusty has practically taken his life from him, he could ask Rusty for this chance to live, after all he was in his body all the time, all he could be was taken away, it could justify it."
venturebros,320xy5,AldusValor,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:01:29 2015 UTC,"Not so much, anymore. At the time of ""Return to Spider-Skull Island"" killing Rusty would've gone towards restoring the family image, but today, with the addition of the ray shield, killing rusty would be a detriment and harm the family name."

venturebros,320xy5,AldusValor,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"There's one thing you're missing from this, otherwise brilliantly thought out and researched response - and it's kind of painful. JJ never had Sr. as his father... but Rusty did. That's the difference. Sr. was an outright horrible father, and is the main reason Rusty is the person he is today. Because JJ wasn't poorly parented by Sr., JJ idolizes the legend of his Father, not the man. There's the main dichotomy in the two brothers."

JJ's intentions are to honor, emulate, and eventually surpass Jonas out of love and respect for the father he never had the chance to meet."

venturebros,31rfd0,usedtobias,15,Mon Apr 13 15:50:05 2015 UTC,"honestly?  i could take it or leave it.  i think the original team venture is infinitely less compelling than the current iteration, and i'd argue that this is by design.  the current team venture and most of this generation's characters are fucked up precisely because they are a reaction to their parents' generation of heroes/villains/scientists, who themselves are supposed to be something of a reflection of that era of hanna-barbera cartoons, comics, etc.  this means that they are rather necessarily less complex, because they need to be the ideals from which the characters the show is based around deviate.  think about rusty.  how much more complicated is he than his father's character?  substantially!  what do we really know about action man and colonel gentleman?  they're sort of novel/funny, but they're also fairly one dimensional by comparison to rusty and hank/dean's generation.  aside from gags like col. gentleman's homosexual decadence, they're mostly pretty straightforward heroes.  they traveled around, didn't suck at their jobs, and did more or less what was expected of them.  the brilliance of the series is in how it subverts these expectations, but that can only happen when there's a previous generation to provide a set of baseline standards for success and virtue.  jonas may have been a shitty father, but he was more or less a Good Guy, and imo, this makes him much less interesting a character than rusty, whose flaws reflect a deeper and more relatable humanity.  i like it in moderation, e.g. flashbacks (especially the victorian-era ones you linked), but i'd have little to no interest in it as a standalone special unless it made some substantial and revelatory contribution to the overarching narrative of the series.  i think they've explored it about as much as they need to; the principal appeal of those characters to me is how they influenced people like rusty, the monarch, and dr. impossible, not who they were as their own individuals.  they're basically just... heroes.  that's not really what i watch the show for."

venturebros,31rfd0,usedtobias,2,Wed Apr 8 00:30:55 2015 UTC,"For me it is a lot like comics, they started with one dimensional characters, like superman, then went to two dimensional characters like spiderman, and now we are seeing something new, characters with multiple dimensions to their character and personality."
venturebros,31rfd0,autowikibot,2,Thu Apr 9 22:54:02 2015 UTC,"interesting observation.  i read some comics, and i'm more or less familiar with the trajectory of the medium throughout the 20th century, but i'm not a huge fan or anything, so i'd always framed the sense of generational progression in the venture brothers in terms of the progression of 20th century science fiction.  in early sci-fi, there's this fairly ubiquitous sense of optimism that came with this contemporary idea that technological advancement was going to be how we reshaped our world into a utopia.  you can totally see this aesthetic reflected not just in the character of jonas venture sr., but in the space age architecture and design of the venture compound itself.  there was this sense of motion to all of it (see: googie architecture) that fed into this idea of progress and the towering captains of industry/men of greatness behind it.  by the 80s, these expectations had been more or less abandoned in their entirety, as people acclimated to a level of technological advancement that had reconciled itself with social/political/economic inequality and all the evils that come with them.  nobody really thought it was going to save us like they did when the stories were all about strong men and beautiful women with fish globes on their heads fighting moon men.  i think that sense of resignation/cynicism came to be represented more and more in sci-fi and that this is where a lot of dystopian/cyberpunk shit came from.  this all seems like it might be irrelevant, but the venture brothers follows this trajectory more or less exactly.  that same lost sense of hopefulness underpins the entire series and, in fact, many of its characters.  rusty, more than anyone else, represents the aborted optimism of early science fiction.  there was so much ambition and potential there, and you could see it in the statue in front of the compound of jonas sr. holding him on his shoulder and pointing off into the distance, and what really came of it?  nothing.  new, super advanced ways to fuck it all up.  his character arc from a prototypical boyhood adventurer to a burnt-out narcissist is the same we see in the genre as a whole as people who began with a better hope for the future (e.g. jonas) gradually became disillusioned and wound up in a world quite different than the one they'd wanted.  so for you to say that it could actually also reflect the progression of 20th century comics as well is really cool and not something i'd ever thought of!  obviously it pulls a lot from comic tropes, and it had never occurred to me to follow the various generations of scientists/heroes/villains and see how closely they corresponded to the golden/silver/bronze age of comics.  now, there is of course crossover here, because a lot of comics were influenced by those same trends within sci-fi, but i could totally see how the fairly sanitary heroism of the early golden age team venture could give way to a grittier, more cynical bronze age venture team of today, where brock is a murderous madman and rusty is, in many instances, an irredeemably terrible person."
venturebros,31rfd0,Minecraftfinn,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:40:27 2015 UTC,"Googie architecture:       Googie architecture is a form of modern architecture, a subdivision of futurist architecture influenced by car culture, jets, the Space Age, and the Atomic Age.  Originating in Southern California during the late 1940s and continuing approximately into the mid-1960s, Googie-themed architecture was popular among motels, coffee houses and gas stations. The school later became widely known as part of the Mid-Century modern style, elements of which represent the populuxe aesthetic,   as in Eero Saarinen's TWA Flight Center.

venturebros,31rfd0,usedtobias,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:41:19 2015 UTC,"Wow yeah after reading this I have the feeling that the progression of character types in the show must be meant to be in someway representative of both.   And the most significant point is that these things, the progression of how we like to see our heroes, and our love/hate relationship with science tell us a lot about the way society has changed since the dawn of sci-fi, and comics which are sort of an off-shoot of sci-fi.  Venture Bros having the same sort of developing society alongside with their developing characters just gives the world that extra layer of juicy realism."
venturebros,31rfd0,SuperSmokingMonkey,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:24:00 2015 UTC,"i agree.  i've thought for quite a while now that the evolution in science fiction narratives represented a gradual disillusionment in american society about the future.  there was a time, i think, when people probably believed that the future belonged to all.  and then, to some, and finally, to few.  i think we can look at the development of pessimism in sci-fi and comics as generally running parallel to the slow death of the american dream.  the 1940s/50s were full of people coming home from wars, getting good jobs they could retire in that paid enough to support a family, and affordable loans for houses.  those were the people who probably thought things were just going to keep on getting better.  i don't think people really believe that anymore, and as they stopped believing it, the stories they told changed -- even the ones that weren't supposed to take place in the real world.  mirroring this really does add a degree of relevance to the series that increases my enjoyment of and respect for it enormously."

venturebros,31rfd0,chrisk018,2,Mon Apr 13 15:18:53 2015 UTC,"I'd personally like to see more ""Johnny Quest"" parody episodes. It always irked me that we only got to see the end of their adventures before the show started getting deep, and begun showing us the Bros and the rest of the cast doing other things.  It's called the ""Venture Bros,"" dammit! Show us some adventures!  But yeah, more Classic Team Venture sounds freakin' sweet. Let's throw in Swifty and Hector while we're at it!"
venturebros,31huht,ThaBenMan,32,Sun Apr 5 05:29:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I agree. Both are fantastic, and both are candidates for 'best in class'. Yes, they share a few qualities in terms of complexity. But The Wire was powerful because it was very different from previous TV shows. It had a powerful social message. The Venture Bros. draws much of its power from the context of shows that came before. Many of its characters, plots and settings are satirical of older cartoons. And at its heart, it's zany fun; any message is secondary to being entertaining. None of these are criticisms, to be clear, just differences."
venturebros,31huht,taocpfa,20,Sun Apr 5 08:05:40 2015 UTC,"I'm sure the Monarch's henchmen yell out ""Brock's comin', yo!"" when they have the time."

venturebros,31huht,andybong,28,Sun Apr 5 14:14:30 2015 UTC,"I think I've heard this comparison before and I agree completely. Some other similarities: both shows follow the 'good guys"" and ""bad guys."" The good guys aren't always very heroic, the low level bad guys are just stuck in a bad situation and the higher level bad guys are often treated sympathetically.  A major theme of both shows is the failure of systems and organizations that once presumably helped their members and the public at large. Now the organization only exploit or stifle with bureaucracy. The Major Crimes unit was only effect in so far as it could insulate its self from the main hierarchy of the BPD just as S.P.H.I.N.X. had to break off from the O.S.I. to get any meaningful heroism done. Where large organizations fail personal relationships are where the characters are able to find success and actualization."

Really excellent use of continuity and callbacks that aren't always seen in television (especially in comedy cartoons)."
venturebros,31huht,18_month_ronin,3,Wed Apr 8 21:19:06 2015 UTC,"That was very well put. The Venture Bros. is at it's core is a comedy, and is rather low brow, but it has instances to being a very high brow story. In that regard, I feel that's what makes the show genuine."

I apologize if my comment offended you but not everybody has the funds to burn on a small aquatic reptilian.

I completely agree with you; if the quality of writing can still be this engaging (I'm more invested in the plot now after the special than I think I ever have been and that's saying a lot) then I say they should take as long as they need. I have so many annual shows to watch that the Venture Bros. releases become a highly anticipated treat.  Another great thing about the show is that it's large yet still somewhat niche fanbase keep the expectancy of quality at a level where it's not 'demanded'. HL3 is an example of pressure on quality that I feel Venture Bros. doesn't replicate. For me, I don't feel an overwhelming expectancy for quality but rather the show consistently delivers and as such I view it as something that when the time comes for release I am excited but until then I don't think about what's to come and instead keep recommending to my friends. It has always maintained and grown in quality and surprises me every season.  Go Team Venture!"

venturebros,30jnoo,occamsdisposablerazr,3,Sat Mar 28 17:39:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand what it takes to do a show like this and how little manpower they have. You can't even compare it to a Matt Stone and Trey Parker situation because (and I'm not deriding South Park for this at all), South Park animation is nearly a streamlined digital puppeteering process at this point."
venturebros,30jnoo,chitwin,2,Sat Mar 28 18:30:28 2015 UTC,Matt and trey do their show in about a week plus do double the episodes of VB. Comparing the 2 isn't fair but it is getting to the point where we as fans should be calling bullshit. We are over a decade away from the premier and haven't even had a release date for season 6.

He could not have been more interested in talking to fans of the show. He was genuinely excited to talk about his writing process and HIS favorite episodes. We were trying not to be super fans and take up all of his time but he just kept talking, which of course we obliged. He held us willing hostages for 45 minutes. And if you want to know his favorite villain name is Doctor Dugong. Doc Hammer loves that show like a proud papa."
venturebros,30jnoo,BrainOfG,1 point,Mon Mar 30 15:04:13 2015 UTC,Are you serious? It's ART for lack of a better term to these guys. They carefully craft each episode and make sure that they're not churning out shit.

venturebros,30jnoo,BrainOfG,2,Wed Apr 1 18:45:58 2015 UTC,I'd argue that it's gotten significantly better than where it was earlier in it's genesis.
venturebros,30jnoo,decker12,-1,Wed Apr 1 18:48:44 2015 UTC,I don't know how they pay their bills with this production schedule. Cartoon Network just pays them a salary without any output for years on end?

venturebros,30ip3q,Algiers,16,Fri Mar 27 20:20:35 2015 UTC,"Ummmmm that is a good question. Going over it, I can find no Dean. It's a collection of characters from the Venture Bros. and it's missing one of the bros."

venturebros,30ip3q,mutantchaos,7,Wed Apr 8 20:18:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I just google image searched this image and it is posted to Publick's old LJ account.  The image looks like it's actually a teaser of new costumes and new characters (from 2007- season 3), so maybe that explains why Dean got no love?  There is Hank with the laser, but no Monarch villains either.  http://jacksonpublick.livejournal.com/19560.html"
venturebros,30ip3q,luciaone,2,Fri Mar 27 23:12:26 2015 UTC,That makes sense. Nobody is in their regular clothes except characters introduced in season 3. If Dean's just in his sweater vest there's nothing to tease.
venturebros,30ip3q,Algiers,3,Sat Mar 28 01:02:03 2015 UTC,I may be wrong but that looks like dean with a beard standing in front across from Hank. Dr. Venture is actually standing in the back right. The real question I think is who is the radioactive Lincoln. Back left.

venturebros,30ip3q,shoe_owner,8,Fri Mar 27 19:30:33 2015 UTC,It was a popular meme on 4Chan's /co/ board a couple of years ago; putting that Hank face on all sorts of characters from all sorts of shows. This was one of the more auspicious applications of it.

venturebros,30ip3q,Just_a_lazy_lurker,24,Mon Mar 30 23:22:44 2015 UTC,Dude in the green sweater looks like a young Swifty. He was one of Jonas's bodyguards and a member of Team Venture.   The guy on the right with the hat and mask looks a lot like the masked man wanted by The Guild in the season 6 teaser. Only in the picture he's missing the beard.   Those are my best guesses.
venturebros,30ip3q,gregenheim,18,Fri Mar 27 18:41:45 2015 UTC,The masked fellow was a swinger at Jonas' swinger parties. The one where he hooked up with Dr. Quymn's mom.
venturebros,30ip3q,gregenheim,9,Fri Mar 27 18:55:39 2015 UTC,"I don't remember him but I trust ya, stranger! Now what is his connection to this? http://www.venturebrosblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/venture-bros-season6-teaser-1024x544.jpg"

venturebros,30ip3q,laszlomoholy,2,Fri Mar 27 21:14:59 2015 UTC,"That's obviously the Monarch wearing a seersucker, mask, and fedora.  No one else has a pointy beard like that.  The one that isn't obviously the Monarch is obviously an homage to Wil Eisner's classic character, The Spirit."
venturebros,30ip3q,Just_a_lazy_lurker,2,Sat Mar 28 00:19:31 2015 UTC,"BAM! I laid out the same theory a while back, and I think it's a good one. Finally playing up on their (blood or not) physical similarities, likely wearing Venture blues while committing crimes to cause the family trouble.  Monarch's family was friends with the Ventures. Jonas knocked up the Monarch's mom behind the Dad's back. Their plane crashes hence attracting Jonas at the site (either as a ""family friend""... or possibly otherwise) where he scoops up the Dad and builds him into Venturion. Malcolm ends up amnesia'ed by the crash, or OSI, etc and left for dead.  Perhaps Monarch finally figures out the truth, but NOW suddenly Rusty is far out of his grasp. So he has to attack him in a different way..."
venturebros,30ip3q,technobarry,2,Sat Mar 28 01:27:50 2015 UTC,Ahhhhh that's right. Gonna have to go back and watch that episode again.

venturebros,30ip3q,MonarchStarcrack,3,Fri Mar 27 19:02:33 2015 UTC,"yeah, I think that first one is swifty. I doubt the other guy is the dude from the season 6 teaser, though, because these characters are all from season three. unless they were planning on it from the very beginning?"

I know he's not a popular character but evil Bud could have had some major potential as no doubt he has a lot of pent up frustrations stemming from his mother.

Surely that would result in the Monarch still being on trial, and the authorities conducting a search for Tiny. Not a very low-key way to mount a kidnapping.  I love the Venture Bros., but I think the plot-lines aren't necessarily always thought out to the last detail. That might even be deliberate; the style they're satirizing was all about having dramatic and convenient plot-twists that drove the action but didn't make a lot of sense. It's the same kind of deus ex machina that saw Superman pull out a previously-unknown power or Batman have the perfect Bat-device in his utility belt every week. You needed constant peril, but also new ways to solve that peril that could be written by a guy on minimum wage churning this stuff out all day, every day. In the end, it was all just about selling crap to kids.  In a way, I think that sums up Venture Bros. pretty well - it's about looking back on this narrative of the future that we were sold and realizing that it doesn't make a lick of goddamn sense. No wonder Dr. Venture's always losing his mind - he seems to be the only sane man in an insane world."

While I don't think he's always losing his mind, I do agree with the last half, that he is the only same man in an insane world. I remember the episode where he was in group therapy with other ex-boy adventurers, and by the end of the episode he came to the conclusion that he didn't need therapy. Somehow despite all the crazy of his world, he actually turned out fairly normal.  But, until you think about it, you don't realize how normal he really is compared to just about everything else in his world. No wonder he seems so impatient and annoyed with all the craziness."

venturebros,2zsadu,boognish21,21,Sat Mar 21 06:40:58 2015 UTC,"The Dark S7 maneuver is a stealth operation given the Dark prefix.  Designed most likely by The Monarch and/or Dr. Girlfriend, the operation's goal is to sabotage security measures in an enemy fortification.  The Monarch has 21, 24, and #1 sneak into Spider Skull Island to hijack the security cameras in the museum.  They patch in the feed from their false cocoon of the chairs and burning copy, tricking Jonas, Brock, and the The Lepidopterists thinking he and his little death ray destroyed their ""pine cone.""  The Dark S7 also messes with the giant death laser's targeting and radar as well, making it look like the cocoon is fixed and much faster. ""I've never seen it move like that, he is seriously humming!""  Overall it's a good look at how cunning The Monarch can be, especially when it comes to subterfuge and outwitting your opponent through sixth grade art project.  The real heroes of the Dark S7 maneuver though are the fearless henchmen who bravely walk headfirst into danger...or, whatever."

There are plenty of shows I'm sure Venture bros fans would like as well based on their taste in VB, but I also think if a post is not related enough to the subreddit it is posted on it makes sense for it to be reported.  If you had started a discussion thread about what shows similar to VB people might not know about, and started that discussion by saying Danger 5 was your pick and could be watched on Netflix now, then that's something not only more related to the theme of the sub but also more inclusive for other people to be involved in the discussion and allowing more to come out of one thread.   That's all I'm saying, just could have been well within the bounds of what is relevant to the sub with some slight tweaks, as it is right now it just stands out as a post with a title that is only related to VB because it starts with ""Attention team venture""."

venturebros,2yzjfy,aphidman,4,Sun Mar 15 17:16:26 2015 UTC,"I think there's a little progression. Killinger is the Mary Poppins for supervillains and probably love to a lesser extent (since he tried to reunite Myra with Rusty). I just think when he discovered his brothers were puppeteering the Sovereign and the Guild he orchestrated a plot to save super villainy and create a brand new Guild.   I'm not sure there's anything more than that, really."
venturebros,2yzjfy,monjoe,2,Sun Mar 15 13:29:05 2015 UTC,This is true and more probable than a conspiracy theory that I proposed. Killinger enjoys getting people together that were meant for each other more than almost anything.  Perhaps another episode with him will prove one way or the other.  In ATAG2 Killenger hints at a larger plan than just love with DMTM so perhaps the producers are playing off of multiple possibilities.
venturebros,2yzjfy,blackProctologist,2,Sat Mar 14 14:16:32 2015 UTC,In ATAG2 the larger plan was to form a new Council of 13 - I guess he just considered DMTM to be best suited for the job.
venturebros,2yzjfy,Am_Fah,5,Sat Mar 14 17:00:02 2015 UTC,"It seems that Killinger is focused in grooming DMTM for being on the council. Either he feels keeping her with the Monarch is the best thing for her, or more interestingly, he does not want to force her to do anything and realizes that she wants to be with the Monarch. When he tried to turn Dr. Venture into a villain he eventually gave up when he realized that it was not what Doc wanted."
venturebros,2yzjfy,thedizzle11,2,Sat Mar 14 17:07:59 2015 UTC,"The investors were in bed with the sovereign as well (killing them being one of the main reasons that he orchestrated the attack on Gargantua 2), which leads me to believe that killinger and his brothers were in some sort of struggle for control of the guild. I would argue that killinger is very firmly in the evil camp, what with his exclusive involvement with super villains, which leads me to believe that killinger and his brothers were engaged in a machiavellian game of cloak and dagger for control of the main force of evil on earth (the real question is whether or not either side was aware of the other's plans). The investors seemed to justify their actions to killinger by arguing that mortals are too foolish to understand the necessity for evil, or how to properly spread it in the world (something I would argue is a vital component to the fundamental nature of the venture universe). Killinger seems to think that it is a mistake for his kind to do anything other than guide mortals in their quest for understanding and progress.   We have no way of knowing how involved the investors were in the machinations of the guild, but I would argue this uneasy sort of truce between the guild and OSI looks an awful lot like Killinger's work. When he was working with the monarch, he seemed reluctant to encourage his obsession with arching Dr. Venture, instead designing a summit. However, one does have to consider, given Killinger's intentions of turning Dr. Venture into a super villain and his attempt to reunite him with Myrah, that the plan was always to bring Rusty over to the guild, and the summit may have been an attempt to ally Rusty with the Monarch. It has been heavily hinted at that the Monarch and Dr. Venture have a shared history, and I've always felt that they looked far too similar to each other for there not to be some sort of relation. All this aside, the investors didn't really seem interested in igniting a war between OSI and the guild, which to me implies that they felt structure and diplomacy were just as important to them as it is killinger.  The only missing piece for me is the intentions of the investors. You rarely see them and they only speak in one episode, which happens to be the last one they're likely to appear in. My guess would be that Killinger and his brothers wanted the evil world to come into it's own form of governance, while the investors felt the only way to accomplish such a thing was to create a structure in which they held all the cards. The last thing the investors ever say is an accusation that Killinger destroyed the guild (implying that it was vital to the plans of both sides). However, Killinger succeeded in recreating a guild that was totally free of the influence of the investors."
venturebros,2yzjfy,thedizzle11,2,Sat Mar 14 14:57:27 2015 UTC,Shame he wasn't successful in turning Rusty into a villain. Would've been cool if there was a chance he'd be included in these guild things.

venturebros,2yvemz,rw258906,104,Fri Mar 13 03:13:11 2015 UTC,"In Viva los Muertos, all of the Scooby Doo parody characters are based on and named after famous metally ill criminals: Val(arie Solonas), who shot Andy Warhol, and suffered paranoid fantasies about male dominated society; Patty (Hearst), daughter of William Randolph Hearst, the publishing tycoon made famous in Citizen Kane, who was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Front, and then ended up joining them on a crime spree, she claimed this was due to her Stockholm Syndrome, which she clearly displays in the episode; Ted (Bundy), a famous serial killer whose sociopathic behavior was deftly reproduced in his character; and Sonny (Whose name was based of David Berkowitz's nickname, the Son of Sam), whose Schizophrenia led him to believe his dog was commanding him to murder sexually attractive women. As the show has done with many other iconic cartoon characters, writer Ben Edlund looked at the Scooby Doo characters and the way they always found themselves stranded in the middle of nowhere where there always happened to be some crazy and ridiculous mystery transpiring, and asked themselves what real life tendencies would lead to or result from this behavior. They decided mental illness was the most likely/funniest, and so chose to give their characters the names and illnesses of famous mentally ill people, which is why ""Freddy"" was named Ted*.  In ""Every Which Way but Zues"", the Venture clan attempt to fake kidnap Rusty in a typically half assed fashion. One of the funnier examples of how they did this was by having Dean use a Teddy Bear so that Rusty cannot identify his voice. Once Dean does this, the joke switches over to Rusty, since he cannot distinguish a teddy bear from a real person. This is taken to the point where even when the teddy bear says he is a teddy, Rusty is so oblivious that he thinks  it is a real person whose name is Ted. This joke is then continued in ""Mommas Boys"" where Rusty has become so deluded that he can now talk on the phone for hours with this teddy bear, all the while thinking he is communicating with a man named Ted.  As you can see, the reason two separate ""characters"" are called Ted is because it was essential for each of their jokes to work that they have that name, not because they are connected with each other in any way.   As for the voice similarity, Scooby Doo Ted has a voice that is a parody of Freddy from the show, while the Teddy Bear and his burnt voice actor are modeled after the voice of a famous toy from the 80s. They do not sound identical to me, Scooby Doo Ted has a evil sort of sneer to his voice, related to his sociopathy, while the bear has an over the top, kid friendly toy voice. It is possible they have the same voice actor, as the show has a small pool of regular voice talent. I have seen numerous small part characters that have identical voices  *The other part of this joke is that Jackson and Doc made the characters not just mentally ill, but mentally ill criminals, because the only reason a group of people living out of a van would have to constantly end up at museums, mansions, and castles would be to steal from them, which is exactly what they do."

venturebros,2yh7xv,hench4lyfe,3,Tue Mar 10 00:52:30 2015 UTC,who said that?
venturebros,2yh7xv,tim_tim_salabim,9,Mon Mar 9 22:20:20 2015 UTC,The way the girl reacts to seeing Brock getting tranq'd by Molotov and how she then addresses her always made me think they weren't Blackhearts just regular prostitutes.
venturebros,2yh7xv,Brambleston,2,Mon Mar 9 20:58:19 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think it was a bluff playing on Block's love for the Ventures, a weakness in Mol's eyes that has come up a couple times.   EDIT: also, she threatens her after Block is tranquilizer IIRC, so she wouldn't be doing it for show (and it would undermine the later threat)."
venturebros,2yh7xv,Bumgill,3,Tue Mar 10 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"Well the prostitutes look an awful like the Blackhearts at the end of ""The Flamily That Slays Together, Stays Together Part 2"" so I'd doubt that they're all prostitutes.  As I tried to explain elsewhere, too, Molotov threatening the prostitute is so brief that it doesn't contradict this. It's written in a way that doesn't spoil the twist for the audience but also, in a way, that if you rewatch it it still lines up.   ""Do you want to live?""   ""Y-Yes""   ""Then I suggest you return to your little party""   That's it, really. It's so brief that it's hard to take anything from her reaction to Mol."
venturebros,2yh7xv,aphidman,10,Tue Mar 10 11:10:47 2015 UTC,"Its quite possible to take away from that whole interaction that a black heart really did want to make it with Brock, and Molotov just wasn't having it."

venturebros,2yh7xv,TitusVandronicus,1 point,Tue Mar 10 01:22:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I mean the only real explanation for that would be it is the show keeping up the charade for the audience, but it doesn't make any sense in the story that the escort would remain in character in front of her leader, Molotov."
venturebros,2yh7xv,grimrotten,4,Tue Mar 10 02:14:23 2015 UTC,maybe some of them were just hookers?

venturebros,2yh7xv,aphidman,2,Tue Mar 10 05:58:54 2015 UTC,"Nah, if you watch the scene again their interaction doesn't contradict anything  ""Do you want to live?"" ""Y-Yes"" ""Then I suggest you return to your little party""  The prostitute isn't staying in character. She just doesn't say ""Yes, ma'm"" or ""Yes Molotov"" for the benefit of the audience. The exchange is so brief that you can't really say she's staying in character. It's Molotov's choice of words ""Then I suggest you return to your little party"" that gives this impression. But it seems like the sort of command a boss would give.  It keeps the twist hidden for the audience but it also explains why she didn't tranq or kill her too."
venturebros,2yh7xv,TVops,2,Tue Mar 10 11:05:14 2015 UTC,"They weren't Blackhearts, they were just whores. Molotov lied to Brock."

There was no evidence in the episode they were any threat until doc interfered.  Also side note one of them was totally about to give Brock a ""Rusty Venture"" which doesn't seem too undercover-y"

venturebros,2y8stb,Slevo,5,Sun Mar 8 07:23:09 2015 UTC,"Right?  Even back to the first episode, when Doc loses his second kidney in Tijuana, he comes through.  I mean, he has to go look up what a kidney does, but from then on it's just an engineering problem for him to build and implant a surgical prosthesis that's well beyond what most surgeons could do.  What he lacks in rote memorization (what kidneys do), he more than makes up for in raw ability and technical skills.  The stuff we see him build may not work perfectly, but I don't think we've ever seen him make something that just flat out didn't do anything at all, have we?    And he somehow manages to perform a double kidney transplant on himself and be up and walking around before the boys recover from their anesthesia.    Knowing that the boys are the 14th or so set of clones makes harvesting a kidney from each of them seem a lot less terrible."
venturebros,2y8stb,scottmill,2,Sun Mar 8 12:49:30 2015 UTC,"I was just about to post the same thing. Though to be fair on your first point, didn't the interns do all the work while Rusty just laid around? Anyways, while he's definitely not at the level of his father or his brother, Rusty CAN be a competent scientist when he really wants to be. Making Helper into a personal dialysis machine, the Joycan, the Walking Eye, Guardo, a nuclear powered forcefield, reviving a human being from death as a zombie, helping create the antidote for the Goliath Serum, not to mention being able to pick up on his father's clone research and manage to NOT screw up the cloning process. That's a pretty damn good list of accomplishments there.   Rusty's problem lies in his laziness, insecurity, and lack of ambition, not because he's incompetent. I think the fact that he's living in his father's shadow and later became shown up by his brother on numerous occasions also hurt Rusty's will to be a better scientist. I'm really hoping that we see a rejuvenated and competent Rusty in Season 6, especially with Doc and Jackson recently saying that they were tired of the show always being about failure."

I don't know if you were just misremembering or if he refers to his ability differently later on, perhaps in the recent Gargantua II special.  EDIT: Just watched more of the clip (probably should have before I posted) and he continues on saying, ""and now I can pull stuff out of time and space..."" which is probably what you are referring to. Now, if we want to get super geek technical about this, which I do, because that's how I roll, we could probably discuss whether or not Fat Chance is contradicting himself in this line. Would ""a portal to another dimension"" technically be described as a thing from which you could ""pull stuff out of time and space.""

I love the beat down failure Rusty we have, and would probably not be crazy about a story arch where everything is going great for him, unless of course it all came crashing down by the end of the season in which it began. That might be a cool little departure similar to the Archer Vice season.

He meant it romantically, kind of like that's the moment he won her over and she fell in love. However, from her perspective it sounds immature, possessive, and controlling. It made it sound like she surrendered her own self to be just a piece of the Monarch and would never be her own woman again. To the Monarch this sounded romantic in the way that a husband and wife may consider themselves a pair instead of two individuals. But notice he said ""I made you [mine]"" not ""We became each other's."""

Good job finding and posting Venture-related stuff, though, don't let my old man ""get off my lawn"" bullshit get in the way of a good time."
venturebros,2xgmdf,CollopB,14,Sat Feb 28 14:11:57 2015 UTC,"I think you might be getting at what people got bothered about, regarding the Sovereign. He's a well-written character with an engaging personality, yet the show doesn't stop to let you meet him.  I kind of like that. Would it have been nice to see that mystery explored? Yeah, but then again, leaving that air of mystery adds to that sense of a fully breathing world that doesn't revolve around the main characters. In the early seasons of the show, we got alot of that with the unexplained name drops that we later went back to meet, like Monstroso or Sergeant Hatred.  More to the point however, I don't think we needed any more details to begin with. We got his story, it was satisfying. And being a shapeshifter is appropriate - he's more of an imitation than a man. Even if we'd known his birth name, Fake Bowie is a more accurate description of his identity.  It's a shame this never really went into the characterization we got from The Revenge Society episode. I think it would have been jarring to see Cremation Creek, then jump ahead to this episode. It's hard to directly call him good or evil, but he was very likely the best Bad Guy there is."
venturebros,2xgmdf,wellgolly,9,Sat Feb 28 16:40:19 2015 UTC,"I think if you watch Bot Seeks Bot it sort of lays the groundwork for the episode. In that he makes it abundantly clear that anonymity is paramount to the Guild and says he'll tolerate no more transgressions of Guild Code after Red Mantle & Dragoon publicly went to Boggles' funeral. In that same episode he also calls for an emergency meeting during the funeral so it's clear he's not one for sentiment.   So it makes sense that once he finds out OSI has figured out the identity of most of his council, and the fear that the Investors are coming to collect, his aggression seems much more in character."
venturebros,2xgmdf,aphidman,3,Sat Feb 28 17:30:45 2015 UTC,"Wow, I never took it as fear. That's a really great point - he was really getting edgy about it.  I always saw it as the Sovereign just noticing that the Investors actually doing something he knew, in a place where they're stuck and isolated meant that this was the best chance he'd ever get.  Maybe that's still true, but what you described is more than enough reason alone. Nice!"
venturebros,2xgmdf,wellgolly,2,Sat Feb 28 18:11:09 2015 UTC,"Seriously, even after reading up on what had just happened following watching AT&G2, I couldn't figure out why he would apparently be offing his own men. It all makes perfect sense...Gods, this show is incredible."

venturebros,2xgmdf,SlumberCat,4,Sat Feb 28 19:48:52 2015 UTC,Who are your #2/#1 out of curiosity? I don't think I could give you a favorite character from this show. They're all such delightful failures and the Sovereign is no different.
venturebros,2xgmdf,NH4NO3-KClO3-C2H6O2,5,Sun Mar 1 03:19:04 2015 UTC,"I apologize for not answering. I will point out I said strongest, not favorite - I'd have to say Brock is my favorite, as he's shown the most development over the series.  Strongest character: I think this is Dr Mrs The Monarch. She's well-written and (mostly) internally consistent. I rarely see her do something and think ""oh, that's just fan service"". She has her weak points (the Moppets) but she has a goal and she's working towards it, even if she has to drag The Monarch by his wings.  The same goes for The Sovereign. He has a goal, and I'm never thinking, ""OH COME ON THAT'S BULLSHIT!"" He has complexity, he's evil, but he's consistent and driven.  The tie for second/third is JJ for all the same reasons.  Relatively, I'd say Rusty is a weak character. He does shit because it's funny and random, and beyond a lot of peyote, I don't buy his motivations. Same for Brock - he's developing, but a lot of what he does is just done to be funny. I don't buy it.  I'm perfectly willing to be set alight for this, but you asked, so there it is. I'd put 21/24 above Rusty, but they're a little too in on the joke, a little too self aware. Now I'm going to go feel bad because someone is going to tweet this at Doc and he's going to be hurt and mention it on the next DVD commentary. Doc, I love you man. Go Team Venture!"

venturebros,2xgzw0,RollThatD20,8,Sat Feb 28 19:17:54 2015 UTC,"There's also the fact that even in every flashback where Jonas Sr. and Kano are around, Kano is still a mute. Why would he be silent for a death he hadn't caused yet?   The implication is there, but the mystery is still alive."

venturebros,2ww0dz,aemoseley,6,Wed Feb 25 20:29:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with your point of wiping the slate clean but I don't think the Sovereign planned to start the Guild again. Lady Mrs. the Monarch said something along the lines of ""You're nothing more than a shape shifter who got in over his head."" If I remember properly, the Sovereign didn't really correct her. After he got in business with people he couldn’t control (the Investors), he realized how out of his own hands the entire Guild was. After this epiphany, he wanted out.  How I see it, the Guild has been a secret society for a very long time considering how old the ORB is and, through its changes over the years, this shape shifter pretending to be David Bowie sort of fell upward into the leader role. Considering the present devious nature of the Guild, he can’t just leave. Namely because, as discovered before, Dean Venture is the rightful Sovereign of the GCI and he abdicated the role. There is no clear line of succession to the title, so if the Sovereign leaves the Guild, odds are someone who would abuse the Guild to their own means (let’s say Phantom Limb?) would rise to power. Whether that happened or not, it’s more than likely that a large, destructive conflict would break out to settle who should be the new Sovereign. That’s a pretty common theme in any power structure.  To avoid the nitty gritty politics and collateral damage of the whole situation, the Sovereign decided that he would use the “cut off the head of the snake” strategy. He chose to kill all of the people currently holding power in the Guild, the Investors, the usurper Phantom Limb, and (intentionally or not) the entire Venture family, which would have effectively gutted the guild of infrastructure and hierarchy. With all the loose ends tied up nice and tight, he hops in his escape pod, flies to Rio, and never has to play Sovereign again."
venturebros,2ww0dz,ShaneValShane,1 point,Mon Feb 23 23:03:54 2015 UTC,"I can agree with this 100%, I wish there could have been more hints or foreshadowing to Bowie or whomever wanting out but considering the new guild we are going to get, I can accept some change regardless to off handed it was"

venturebros,2ww0dz,aphidman,11,Mon Feb 23 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"I think he believed he was allowing the Sovereign entry through the ""back door"" by disengaging the shields when, in reality, the Sovereign just wanted Gargantua-2 to be destroyed - which would also kill Phantom Limb. And perhaps triple crossed refers to the fact that the Investors were the ones who destroyed the panel."
venturebros,2ww0dz,PileMaster,1 point,Mon Feb 23 18:36:47 2015 UTC,That makes sense! They had to sneak aboard via the ship that was carrying General Treister. So basically Limb realized that Sovereign knew that a meteor shower was coming and was trying to take him out.
venturebros,2ww0dz,Trill-I-Am,3,Mon Feb 23 18:51:02 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else here said the reasoning behind destroying Gargantua 2 was to kill off the investors, but the reason he killed off so much of the council was to bait a trap for the OSI. The guild knew the OSI was watching the council, so that means the Sovereign knew that as well. He killed off the council members to force the OSI to move in on his base to apprehend him, and he knew they'd send some of their top operatives since he was such a high priority target. That's why he self destructed his base. It wasn't just to kill Dr Mrs the Monarch. If he wanted to do that he could have just shot her.  The council was compromised, the OSI was onto him, and he had some kind of deal with the investors he couldn't afford to go through with.  If everything would have gone according to his plan he would have been rid of all three of them and could have rebuilt his powerbase with only a severely crippled OSI to oppose him."
venturebros,2ww0dz,Polantaris,2,Tue Feb 24 03:23:01 2015 UTC,I don't understand the nature of the deal he'd made with the investors. Did they ever specify?
venturebros,2ww0dz,blaspheminCapn,3,Mon Feb 23 18:43:37 2015 UTC,Nope. We know that Force Majeure was Sovereign's predecessor ... maybe the deal had something to do with putting Sovereign in charge.
venturebros,2ww0dz,Beiki,2,Mon Feb 23 18:49:23 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the ""deal"" with Phantom Limb was to just get him on the station, so that it would be destroyed with him on it. As others have mentioned.  The Council was completely compromised due to the Monstroso leak. The only members who weren't compromised were ones that were new. Dr. Mrs. The Monarch, and the other two (I forget their names) were all new members, and therefore were not compromised. The rest were killed off. I don't think he intended to kill them, until they didn't agree with him. He was likely going to include them in the plan, but when they said he was nuts, he decided they were also a liability and tried to kill them."

In other words - Maybe Dr.Venture is successful at getting Rusty: Boy Adventurer to the stage and while it's going on there are things happening around the production.  We get snippets of songs etc. but it's not the major focus.  Then we could get the full musical through downloads (if they could afford it) without doing an entire musical episode."

I tried a Roku and despite the advertising on the box is doesn't have the codecs to play any .avi or .mkv file I load.  However what would happen if the Ventures developed an even greater cult following from Netflix? This could...I dunno maybe motivate Jackson & Doc to be a little more expedient in producing the next season if a truckload of money is backed up to the Astro Base

venturebros,2vylnu,yourself117,2,Sun Feb 15 21:45:15 2015 UTC,That's correct. Couple of guys were reaching out to 3080 yards with it.
venturebros,2vztgg,LibrtyUniversity,5,Sun Feb 15 19:08:02 2015 UTC,"To me, this is one of the weaker episodes, though like all episodes of The Venture Bros, not all bad. It is saved by a fantastic plot between Rusty and his hallucinations of (first seen here in a fantastic sequence) Jonas Venture.  If you think about it, this sequence lays so much foundation to the entire understanding of the mythos of the show, in just minutes. The ability to expand on themes, events, and characters in short scenes and twenty-two minute episodes is a talent that keeps this show fresh and amazing.  The subplot of Brock, Ana, and Bud is just meh. Baldavitch is not an interesting character. He ""can't see her face because it is too ugly"" joke is barely funny the first time. And Bud Manstrong is hands down one of the most boring, least ""Venture-verse"" characters on the show. He's not even fun to hate. He's just lame.   The C-plot! with the boys is, as normal for season one, vaguely humorous (the scene where Brock fucks Baldavitch and they think they are fighting is pretty funny, if too long), but nothing special or interesting.   I give it a 2/5- below average, but not all bad."
venturebros,2vztgg,tinook,5,Sun Feb 15 19:15:25 2015 UTC,"The exchange of blame between the Jonas mirage and Rusty is pretty important to explain Rusty's feelings of inadequacy or futility in living up to Jonas.  This show is good for a laugh, but I wouldn't watch this out of the blue unlike many other episodes."
venturebros,2vztgg,SuperSmokingMonkey,2,Mon Feb 16 04:39:49 2015 UTC,"Brock on Baldavich is the best scene in this one, and I agree it's just a 2/5, there are fewer worse episodes than this one.    I love how the hallucination of Jonas Sr is bigger because Rusty got bigger, so the Ratio from Child Rusty:JonasSr = Rusty:hallucinationJonasSr."
venturebros,2vztgg,eliminatorboatduel,3,Mon Feb 16 23:08:31 2015 UTC,"Lately I keep finding myself saying ""Wow, that's a big one."" in Ana's accent. Nobody knows what I'm taking about."

venturebros,2vztgg,tinook,2,Tue Feb 17 15:12:18 2015 UTC,"See, I have zero friends in real life who watch The Venture Bros, so this kind of situation comes up all the time. Preach it."
venturebros,2vztgg,aemoseley,2,Sun Feb 15 23:13:57 2015 UTC,It is refreshing to watch an episode without the Monarch although this is so early on it is not unusual.  This sometimes is boring to watch as I kind of expect some antagonist chasing Dr. V and explosions to boot.    Not a bad episode; just different.  Perhaps above explanation is why people label it a the bad episode notwithstanding the other Bud Man. episode.
venturebros,2vztgg,tinook,5,Mon Feb 16 04:30:39 2015 UTC,"Always felt like this was an underrated episode. The Manstrong episodes always seem to be hated by a majority of Venture Bros. fans, but I enjoy both of them.   Obviously, the main plotline to take away is Dr. Venture's inadequacy next to his father. Right out the bat, Jonas is shown to be far superior in science to Rusty in every way, despite Rusty constantly trying to blame everything on his father (and not surprisingly, the problem ends up being Rusty's fault). That said, Rusty does bring up a good point when he asks ""Who lets a 10 year old on a space station?"" It may be subtle, but it does sort of plants the seed that Jonas may have been a great scientist, but much like Rusty, he was a pretty shitty father.   Manstrong isn't a very interesting character, but he is serviceable for what he's portrayed to be and isn't as terrible as people make him out to be. He isn't quite as over-the-top boy scout as his second appearance, and he almost came off as sinister when he was telling the boys about Phantom Space Man. The part where Brock mentions that the panels had never been opened made me think Manstrong might have had ulterior motives the first time I watched.   I wasn't a fan of Anna's character, but that's more because I despise the ""character's face is so ugly we can't show it"" trope. Just show us what she looks like. Let us decide whether she's truly ""hideous"" or not. Also, Brock and the boys were mostly filler here, although Hank and Dean were mostly entertaining freaking out over their father's supposed death. Brock is still pretty one-dimensional with his ""kick ass, have sex, leave"" mentality, though it seems like Mid-Life Chrysalis is the first episode where his character starts being fleshed out.   All in all, while it really necessarily as funny as other episodes, it's mostly good for an early-Season 1 episode.   Funniest moments:  1. Phantom Space Man! It was a clever throwback to old Scooby-Doo episodes.  2. The boys cheering Brock on while he was having sex with Anna, and then their faces when they seemingly realized what they actually watched.  3. Hank and Dean thinking Helper was Phantom Space Man and beating him up (poor Helper).  4. Helper's phone call to some random lady. ""It's alright, it was just someone trying to fax me""."
venturebros,2vztgg,aemoseley,2,Mon Feb 16 00:39:42 2015 UTC,The consensus on Bud Man. episodes being bad is a head-scratcher.  Perhaps the character of Bud is too weak and thus unlikeable.  The boys act in this episode in a classic way that befits the shows intro. ie. Scooby-Doo-ish as you describe.
venturebros,2vztgg,thebanester,3,Mon Feb 16 04:35:23 2015 UTC,"Bud is a fairly one-dimensional character so I can understand why some may dislike him, but it's not like he was ever the main focus. He's a minor character at best in the two episodes he's featured in (not counting cameos obviously). Honestly, I wouldn't complain if Bud appeared in another episode as long as he had a minor role. That being said, there are far more interesting characters in the Ventureverse than Bud, and I can totally understand why Doc and Jackson aren't exactly dying to put him in another episode. Frankly, I'm surprised they haven't killed him off yet."
venturebros,2vztgg,aemoseley,2,Mon Feb 16 04:58:20 2015 UTC,"Bud is not the most interesting character but he has some great lines; ""sharky's machine"" and his delivery along with saying things like jiffy and such really lends itself to the ventureverse style similar to old Hana Barbera cartoons etc."
venturebros,2vztgg,21and24,2,Wed Feb 18 12:26:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree. He's definitely a throwback to the old Hanna-Barbera cartoons. He fits right in with first season Hank and Dean. I guess with the show going away from the Johnny Quest/Scooby-Doo parody concept of the first season, there just hasn't really been a need for him anymore. Still wouldn't mind seeing him pop back up in a small speaking cameo. Wonder if he ever became Vice President?"

You generally don't see such development in animated/humorous shows, but psychotic/violent Brock compared to disillusioned/tired/maternal Brock from later seasons illustrates the shift in depth as the show progressed.  I mean, Hank and Dean in the first couple seasons are complete idiots and that's one of the central appeals of the show (Mecha-Shiva, Mecha-Shiva, Mecha-Shiva!!!), but now they're actually maturing young adults with very distinct personalities.  It's nuts.  For a show that started out as a general satire of Jonny Quest and comic/nerd culture in general, they've done a far, far better job than most shit on television of making their characters into three-dimensional humans."

Now Museum has a throwback aspect and a retrospective of past events.  It can hook some people.  Other people like a focused plot, and Doc and Jackson shine in these as well.  Ghost of the Sargasso like others have said, but perhaps one a focused plot requires no backstory like Victor Echo November.  ORB or other main plot episodes are good ideas but are too much too soon."

venturebros,2vbxgu,aphidman,7,Mon Feb 9 19:34:20 2015 UTC,"This was one of the first episodes I saw and I never would have guessed it was the first episode of The Venture Bros. I'm not sure the pilot really counts but anyone who picked up the DVD would have been exposed to Dia de Los Dangerous first. It's interesting that the episode just throws the viewer straight into the deep end as if this is just another episode of The Venture Bros.  It's certainly has a more plodding pace than the show eventually evolved into but I think there's actually a lot to like from the Venture Bros first outing. And as a first episode it really makes an effort to keep viewers on their feet.   The thing that I like most about it is the Monarch's growing paternal instincts as he feels morose about the abandonment of his own butterfly ""parents"". His sort of paternal relationship with Speedy was also quite amusing. I also find Dr. Venture's search for his kidneys darkly twisted.  And Brock's murderous rampages are pretty entertaining.  It's not the greatest episode but I thought it was a pretty solid first episode for the show."

venturebros,2vbxgu,LibrtyUniversity,1 point,Mon Feb 9 19:42:33 2015 UTC,I also think these should be done in the intended DVD order rather than the order on Wikipedia or Netflix.   What's the difference in order between them?

There's a thread lower down called ""the correct viewing order"" or something.  For example. Home Security was the third episode aired for Season 1 but is supposed to be episode 7. You can tell because the episode has a brief Helper flashback from the actual third episode Mid-Life Chrysalis."
venturebros,2vbxgu,fenshield,1 point,Mon Feb 9 22:42:35 2015 UTC,I was planning to go DVD order unless people wanted TV order. So DVD order it is :)
venturebros,2vbxgu,SuperSmokingMonkey,1 point,Tue Feb 10 00:22:14 2015 UTC,"I have a few problems with this episode. It's the first episode discounting the pilot, so clearly not everything is quite in place. But the Monarch acts so....un-Monarchy in this episode. I feel like in any subsequent season he would never go ""creepy-uncle"" on the boys since his blind rage for Venture is so intense. You get a taste of it when darts 37 at the start, but he's pretty tame otherwise. He's more of a cool, plotting villain than the impulsive maniac we know him as now.  It's also hard to believe that this is actually the first time the boys have been kidnapped, and that they've never heard Doc talk about him before, though this could be a hint to them being clones. All this is great for showing what a failure the Monarch is (which is I think the point of the whole episode) but so much of it gets ret-conned the more we learn of the Monarchs past, like how he's been out to get Venture since college.  I've tried to get a lot of my friends into this show starting with this episode, and usually no one is impressed, which I can sort of understand. I feel like if this was my intro to the Ventureverse the plot of the show would be the Monarch trying to get the boys back over and over, and clearly that never happens.  I dunno. It's a pretty solid intro episode looking back. We understand clearly that Rusty is a terrible, self-centered father (the kidneys!), the Monarch and henchmen totally suck at their jobs, Brock is a godlike badass, and the titular Bros are really not that important at all. It's definitely necessary to watch, if anything for the Monarch's flashback, but I feel like it ended in a confusing direction."
venturebros,2vbxgu,LibrtyUniversity,2,Tue Feb 10 16:12:10 2015 UTC,"Eh, I feel the Monarch's paternal instinct was because he was in an emotionally vulnerable place at the time. The boys certainly know who the Monarch is - ""we're in the belly of the lair of the Monarch!"" - but I just got the impression that since Doc never really talks about his villains outside of their arching (and he never really does it for the rest of the series) I can see why the Monarch might just feel one of many. And why Hank assumed Baron Underbheit was his dad's actual archenemy."
venturebros,2vbxgu,charles_barkley_bot,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:21:38 2015 UTC,"Ah - that's true. He was on his butterfly search. And they probably learned about the Monarch from Brock.   And I just realized Underbheit, unlike the Monarch, has a VERY good reason to arch Rusty."
venturebros,2vbxgu,aemoseley,0,Tue Feb 10 16:23:56 2015 UTC,"I think you had the boy's ignorance/stupidity coming from being cloned so many times as the correct reason to their memory blanks.  D-13 even states he's smarter because he never died or got 'reset'  Why does Underbheit have a good reason to arch Rusty? If anything UnderBheit should hate The Monarch, because he is the one tried to bomb Rusty in college but failed and hit Underbheit instead.  Rusty was his lab partner and I guess he left Underbheit and whatever experiment unattended.  (probably trying to flirt, unsuccessfully)  Now Underbheit has a reason to hate the Ventures because they got him banished from Underland.  Man, so much of my brain is taken up by cartoon history!  ...Wow....that sucks."

venturebros,2vaxal,yeaweckin,24,Mon Feb 9 14:49:58 2015 UTC,"The Terrible Secret of Turtle Bay is the worst episode of the show. But it's the arguably canon pilot so I don't think it really counts.  I rewatched most of the show, recently, and I think my least favourite episode might have been ""Guess Who's Coming to State Dinner?""  Not because of Bud Manstrong. He wasn't a great character in Careers in Science but in this episode I think he's one of the stronger points. I think it's because the episode is trying too many things at once. And the ghost of Lincoln and the plot, although kind of funny, feels very alien to the the rest of the series. It just feels like an episode outside of the rest of the series."

The second problem I have with this episode is the Shoehorning in of the Revenge society, their recruitment process adds nothing to the plot  Third Problem: Weak followup to the amazing ""Everybody goes to Hank's"" Need I say more here?   Lastly, the fucking conclusion to  the ""mystery rusty"" cliffhanger, Its so bullshit, and as said Hammer and Publick have both acknowledged such, tying these episodes together with that bs cliff hanger was just kinda horrible"

venturebros,2vaxal,uuhson,6,Wed Feb 11 17:02:08 2015 UTC,"Escape to the House of Mummies Part II  I understand that this was a jab at only seeing the second part of a three episode story, but the whole episode was so slap-dash random. Picking up Caligula, Freud, and Poe; Dean's disembodied head; Rusty completely forgetting his sons over a shrinking competition. Well, that last one's pretty believable, but the other things seem like they're outside the Venture universe. It's not that I don't like the episode, I think I like them all. It just doesn't seem to fit with all of the others.  Edit: I've just re-watched this episode in response to being downvoted for having a difference of opinion. I will say I was very wrong about one thing in particular: Rusty. He is in character for the entire episode. It is more surprising that Dr. O forgets about the boys for the sake of pride. But all in all, I feel the Rusty/Orpheus plot-line is excellent. I guess I just can't get over the random plotlessness of the Hank/Dean/Brock/Caligula/Freud/Poe/Brock parts. One scene seemed to have nothing to do with another. You may not even notice if they had been put in the episode in a different order. Now, Doc & Jackson have left entire scenes to your imagination before, this is a good thing. But never before (or since) did they fail to tell the story by doing so. Personally, I feel that this is the case in this episode."

Dean and Doc are two personalities that REALLY need someone else to temper them, and they only had each other to bounce off of.  I thought the Brown Widow was pretty forgettable, even though I was really looking forward to Nathan Fillion.  Plus the Revenge Society was all over the place.    Everybody Comes to Hank's - I hate Dermott's storyline, so I don't like this episode.  I think they should've just let his parentage be a mystery for the rest of the series, with occasional hints.  But the episode itself was structured better than Dean's.    The Pilot for obvious reasons, but it's understandable."

venturebros,2vaxal,tinook,2,Tue Feb 10 16:12:31 2015 UTC,Love Bheits is mostly hilarious considering we see a giddy Underbheit among other things.    In most of my least favorite episodes there's something I just don't want to watch like Dean dress like a girl and all the creepiness of Underbheit.  With Viva los Muertos it's probably that the Frankenstein stands out.  Not sure why.  I ranked these because these are the episodes I more frequently want to skip over knowing full-well I laughed at and enjoyed each of them.  This is one top-notch show.
venturebros,2vaxal,The-Red-Panda,3,Tue Feb 10 01:35:39 2015 UTC,"Weird, I always got the impression  viva Los Muertos was a fan favorite but this sub seems to dislike it. I don't love or hate it really."

venturebros,2v44v9,eak125,28,Sun Feb 8 12:38:02 2015 UTC,"I think that when Orpheus tells Al that he can't make him rich, it's a more narrow response to the general ""Bewitched Question"", which is basically: ""why can't I just use magic to solve all of my problems?""   Al was going through a rough patch, and I'm not sure if he necessarily wanted to be rich, but he certainly wanted to use magic to solve his problems. He also wanted to help Hank solve his mystery, and he and Orpheus definitely got a reminder of the dangers of using magic to reveal secrets.  I love it when movies, books, and television that involve magic introduce this question. It seems that, even across different stories, magic users know that magic is a crazy cosmic force of which they barely have any control or understanding. They seem to understand that the over-use of magic can bring with it some monkey's-paw-like unintended consequences, which are usually impossible to predict, much less deal with. There are restraining ""rules"" with magic, and making yourself instantly rich, or traveling through time, or making someone fall in love with you, or vaporizing all your enemies would bring a whole new and unpredictable host of problems.   So I kinda lost the original question in there, but I think the answer is that Al COULD make himself rich, and he makes the choice not to, but not because he wants to be poor. He doesn't do it because his life would catastrophically change if he did."

The Monarch's parents died in a plane crash, hence the connection, but of course, Doc and Jackson could just disregard that, and make something else  up entirely.

venturebros,2uwuxu,ProtoJMan,5,Thu Feb 5 21:12:24 2015 UTC,"I think it is likely that the Investors were the ones who gave JJ cancer. The other death in the series that was used to repay their debt (as opposed to protecting the Guild as with Monstroso) was King Gorilla's, and his death was caused by cancer.  However, the other theory I have contradicts that. I think to repay his debt from the Guild, the Investors were the ones who made Phantom Limb turn on the Sovereign, thus resolving both of their debts at once. This would explain why Phantom Limb never had to pay back his debt, and also why the Sovereign would be willing to trust Phantom Limb again; if the Sovereign knew Phantom Limb was forced to turn on him, he would be more understanding, as even the Sovereign is afraid of the Investor's power."
venturebros,2uwuxu,Skyarrow,4,Fri Feb 6 04:39:31 2015 UTC,"I'm still of the mind that during the month Rusty was gone ""finding himself"" during the opening montage of Powerless in the Face of Death, JJ made a deal with The Investors which was how he was able to get 2 doctorates and become so successful within the month Rusty was gone.   Something I've noticed throughout the series, and maybe someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but despite JJ's constant success and superior intelligence, we never actually SEE him doing anything science related. Sure, he does repair some of Rusty's inventions in Return to Spider Skull Island, but that's really it. Usually every time we see him, he's either bossing someone around or talking on the phone. I found it particularly odd that he couldn't figure out how to deactivate Rusty's force-field generator in Guess Who's Coming to State Dinner, despite being the superior of the two. Could it be that maybe JJ was really a sham and that The Investors did all the work for him?   I don't know, just a thought or two."

And even if JJ did know or understood who they really were, JJ knew he was going to cheat them by dying before they had a chance to collect anyway. But that wasn't the investor's intention anyway.

And, of course, to finance a giant cherry on top to further all their plans - just like Killinger, and also Sovereign. Brock and Hunter understood that too, which is why Brock and Amber are in route - and doing so covertly."
venturebros,2uwuxu,blaspheminCapn,2,Fri Feb 6 14:22:35 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they were a big part of his success and not there for JJ's cancer.

venturebros,2uvfbo,amedeus,3,Thu Feb 5 20:25:50 2015 UTC,"I think you're taking what they're saying too literally. They're addressing the question that the Halloween special was designed to confuse viewers. So when Doc Hammer says ""after the first half hour, the Halloween special should be viewed, and then go back... "" he's telling us when the special takes place in the Ventureverse.  He's not actually saying that's how the episodes are designed to be viewed. Publick even explains that he thought it was fun to drop viewers in an ongoing story.  EDIT: As in they're explaining where the Halloween special is to be placed for it all to make chronological sense for the viewer. But the season's designed to drop viewers in the confusing deep end. Much like the beginning of Season 4 drops viewers into the deep end.  I mean, it's completely fine to watch it this way but it's not the intended way - it's just the chronological way."
venturebros,2uvfbo,aphidman,1 point,Fri Feb 6 00:36:37 2015 UTC,"Weren't they originally going to be one episode? Then the Halloween stuff was rewritten and repurposed as its own thing simply to give people something to watch while they waited for the new season.

venturebros,2uvfbo,aphidman,2,Fri Feb 6 11:00:23 2015 UTC,"Nah, the Halloween special was just going to be an early episode in the season after Colour. But they rewrote things a bit when they made it into a special.  I'd rather watch them separately because the stories don't really relate to each other and both have their own climaxes. I don't think Halloween/Colour would work very well as a super long episode. The pacing would be way off."
venturebros,2uvfbo,hdsrob,2,Thu Feb 5 21:41:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the one I wasn't quite sure about. I've only just started rewatching them in this order (after a good year of watching any of them at all) and haven't gotten that far yet. I only put it first because it was aired a year earlier, but included it in season 5 since the production code is for 5. Should Halloween be watched after What Color? I don't remember if it showed any links between the 2."

I don't know about Dr. Z or Red Mantle n' Dragoon.  I don't think the Soveriegn, the Investors, the old council or JJ will be back.

I'd like to see more Brock/Hatred interaction next year - because it was barely touched on in Season 4.

venturebros,2uolbj,iwasateenagepunk,2,Wed Feb 4 15:36:53 2015 UTC,"My biggest contention with the Investors as vampires was their ability to sink through the floor and go through walls, which made them seem more ghostly to me. I looked up a list of typical vampire powers and traits and I guess they do meet most of the criteria from classical sources -- and I suppose the going through solid objects could fall under 'transformation into fog.'"
venturebros,2uolbj,MagicalHamster,3,Wed Feb 4 16:42:25 2015 UTC,"They mentioned they don't show up without being invited either, and it is said a vampire can't enter someones home without being invited in first."

venturebros,2uolbj,Bloodysneeze,6,Wed Feb 4 03:43:18 2015 UTC,"Killinger had just quoted Shakespeare, IMO that line was just to show how dumb the general was."
venturebros,2uolbj,detentist,1 point,Wed Feb 4 16:58:47 2015 UTC,But if Killinger is the devil then wasn't that an odd coincidence?
venturebros,2uolbj,Bloodysneeze,6,Wed Feb 4 17:06:30 2015 UTC,"At first I was thinking, no way. If he WAS the literal devil, his brothers would be named things like Baal or Beelzebub or Asmodeus.  But then I remembered when Torrid was being a dick and opened a portal to hell. And Cthulhu came out. And when the Outrider 'died', they had to go to hell to rescue him.  Now I'm pretty sure they called it 'the other world', but they definitely had a hell-like dimension.  So it is entirely possible that Killinger is a being from there, who could call himself the devil. But not THE devil, because that would necessitate a Jehovah-type god, which I just can't picture in the show!  But at no point do I suspect that line was a reference to any of this, I stand by my guns that the line was meant to make the general in particular, and the army in general, look dumb! :D"
venturebros,2uolbj,detentist,5,Wed Feb 4 17:30:07 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. Killinger is increasingly shown as more and more powerful/able to control the way things play out. His first major appearance that you mentioned where he evicted Orpheus is spot on. Orpheus knows something terrible about Killinger's powers. If he is not actually the devil, he is something very close. Also ATAG2 showed him as having more involvement with the Investors, which are pretty powerful/mysterious beings themselves.  What are your thoughts on why Orpheus never saw the need to fully explain what it was about Killinger that scared him/made his brain go pop."
venturebros,2uolbj,DJdekutree,3,Tue Feb 3 21:54:39 2015 UTC,"I think Orpheus was scared because he has never run into a being as powerful as Killinger. At the end of gargantua 2, he tells his brothers ""nein, it is you who have forgotten your place. We were never meant to rule over these mortals.""  I think Killinger is a-moral just like his real world counterpart or the greek gods. He's doing something according to a greater plan that is beyond the realm of mortal intelligence and I seriously doubt that his brothers are ""dead"" in the traditional sense."

Note the absolute calmness, the lack of maliciousness, the authoritative effortlessness when he resolves situations... Versus The master, who is confined to another realm in Orpheus' daughter's closet, shape-shifts (just a parlor trick, the Sovereign could do it and now Prof Impossible can too) and takes every opportunity to viciously mock Orpheus who's just earnestly seeking guidance.  They're opposing forces of apparently similar intensity, but I doubt The Master wants to go up against Killinger."

But the VentureVerse also seems pretty much married to a scientific view of the universe -- Doc is never impressed by Orpheus' magic, even when it exceeds what science can currently explain. The OSI didn't accept the possibility that 'Zeus' was really 'Zeus'.   So I feel that it's better to view the VentureVerse through that kind of lens. Magic is a way of interacting with the universe through some sort of quantam mechanic mumbo-jumbo, and the Gods/Spirits are just lifeforms vastly more powerful than humans, perhaps existing partially on a higher dimension, or whatever.  So I don't think The Master or Killinger could ""literally"" be the devil. At most I feel they could be ancient lifeforms that inspired the legend of the devil, but their power lists would probably differ, and their history probably wouldn't match up with their theological counterpart.

If Jonas has been alive the whole time, it under cuts any of the emotional moments in the whole show. In Victor Echo November they briefly go with that Contact ending just to laugh at how silly it would be if the alien were Jonas. Same with ATAG2, it is put forward and smacked down so quickly with DMTM that it just seems like they are playing with the fans who want Jonas to be alive.

Take that with a grain of salt, as since that was clearly in the '70s, it may have been the real Bowie since I believe NotBowie was still a low-level villain during that time (though it's possible NotBowie could have been attending with Bowie disguised as one of the other attendees).   I know everyone sees Sovereign's fake reveal as Jonas as merely a dig at fan theories, but when you look it from an in-universe perspective, I think it shows that NotBowie obviously knew Jonas and was associated with him in some way. Who knows? Maybe NotBowie used to arch Jonas back in the day before he became Sovereign? Maybe NotBowie was the one who killed him?

venturebros,2um0z4,scottmill,1 point,Tue Feb 3 17:16:33 2015 UTC,"Good questions. I think G1 could go either way, it was built long enough ago that ray shielding may not have even been considered, but also Jonas Venture Sr. was such a genius that he may have taken care of that in the initial design. Also maybe the ray shielding was only necessary for long term space visits on G2. Maybe JVjr. was only aboard G2 in short bursts of time, where radiation exposure wouldn't be significant, but he knew he needed a shield for when the general public would be staying there for long periods of time. Also supports the idea that he didn't care if he got radiated because he already had cancer."

Another thing this thread made me think about was that bug villain (I forget his name) they mention in ""What color is your cleansuit?"". Maybe he was working for Jonas Venture Sr. on the original ray shield for G1 and thats when he got turned into that bug mutant thing Jonas Jr. mentions when talking to rusty.

On Gargantua-2, the radioactive emissions will hit the thick metal plate separating its habitation compartments from cold vacuum. On Earth in Dr. Venture's lab, the radioactive emissions will hit the hapless Palaemon interns, the lab equipment, and any helpless bystanders in the area. All those items will be saturated by radioactive particles and are therefore a radiation hazard.  (Super science fun fact: Light is a form of radiation.

venturebros,2um0z4,joeythehamster,6,Tue Feb 3 15:41:32 2015 UTC,"Ben was the name of the JK Simmons guy living in the Potter's Field.  And he mentions that the newer clones don't have the fetiform teratoma anymore: so Rusty was probably a clone Jonas Sr made after Rusty died.  It probably explains why he's so blasé about cloning his own kids (though I have to wonder why he didn't have any clones of himself ready to go in case he bought it: maybe he's not ready to kill himself, but he's not really trying to prolong his life, either)."

venturebros,2um0z4,ep29,2,Tue Feb 3 19:20:06 2015 UTC,Maybe thats why he hates himself.  Its kinda the same way that Dean is moving... Hating himself and everything else around him.
venturebros,2um0z4,joeythehamster,3,Tue Feb 3 21:22:07 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no. Doc vacillates between hating himself and believing he is the world's greatest person.   Dean just lacks self-esteem in general and doesn't hate himself as much as he wants to be taken seriously by the people around him and be allowed to grow into himself more naturally (in this way he is envious of Hank, who is allowed this freedom for the most part), but Dean constantly fails to recognize the manner in which Hank receives his abuse and becomes bitter because of this disconnection within the Doc-Dean-Hank triangle. I would argue that the only reason Hank is ""better adjusted"" is because his role model is not a Venture.   Dean is thus left to push against the life Doc is trying thrust on him, whereas we know that college-age Doc was very much into the super-science thing and has only become disillusioned with it as his failures have surpassed his triumphs. Dean lacks interest from the get go, having seen how miserable his father his. He cannot walk the same path that Hank does, as Hank, as Doc says in Season 4, enjoys this life, and Dean feels betrayed by many, if not all, the people he's known throughout his life during most of Season 5.   This leaves an abandonment of the Venture life the only option that Dean is capable of seeing. This is why Dean becomes angry at learning he's a clone, while Hank greets the news with his typical Hank-ness. This is why he feels needy enough to try and establish a relationship with Myra in ""Momma's Boys"" and why he starts keeping a journal (diary is a bit of a girl's word).   The biggest difference between Dean and Doc is that Doc would never have this crisis of confidence without the external circumstances being pressed upon him--he's the world's most put-upon dad in that respect (or at least how he sees it), but pushes through those instances for the sense of self and status if gives him. On the other hand, Dean is actively diving in and trying to figure out who he is in a way that Doc never could--Dean being the one Venture capable of real introspection--and as such has found a modicum of confidence along with the recognition that his place ultimately lies outside the world of super-science and costumed villainy and the realization that he does not hate himself, that his life can have meaning and that it's on him to do that work, otherwise Doc will just turn him into Doc."

venturebros,2uh8e2,takumf,12,Mon Feb 2 04:15:22 2015 UTC,Pete Carroll is the coach of the Seattle Seahawks. Pete Carroll decided it was a good idea to have Russell Wilson throw a fucking slant while they were at the 1 yard line instead of having Marshawn Lynch run the ball in for a touch down.   Pete Carroll pissed away a super bowl win
venturebros,2uh8e2,Eso8910,10,Mon Feb 2 04:48:49 2015 UTC,"With three attempts left, from the 1 yard line(1m-ish), the coach of the Seahawks had his Quarterback throw the ball, instead of handing it off to their open runningback, which was intercepted by the Patriots.  That decision could be said to have cost the Seahawks the game."
venturebros,2uh8e2,grimsaur,14,Mon Feb 2 04:38:22 2015 UTC,"To pile on, the Seahawks runningback had been doing really well all game. To call such a risky play when they didn't need to was stupid...and great! That is to say, I dislike the Seattle coach greatly."

venturebros,2uh8e2,Knocktopus,2,Mon Feb 2 06:51:32 2015 UTC,"The decision to throw wasn't a mistake. They had 3 downs left with well less than a minute left and only one time out - either the second or third down would have to be a pass attempt.  If second down wasn't a throw, then third down would have to be in order to be able to do whatever they want on 4th down."
venturebros,2uh8e2,HellaSober,4,Mon Feb 2 11:55:20 2015 UTC,Exactly. It looks bad in hindsight but was a good idea thinking that the Patriots would be looking for a run play. Unfortunately for Seattle it sounds like the Patriots knew it was a pass play all the way.  I do love the idea of Carrol talking in 24's voice. Have to do that in my head from now on
venturebros,2uh8e2,inkstud,2,Mon Feb 2 13:56:25 2015 UTC,"Way too subjective to say it wasn't a mistake when Seattle didn't do a very good job hiding the play and Seattle had been really brazen all game with telegraphing everything.  101 football says you run and use a spike and never risk the interception.  Especially when you have a top O-line and one of the best RB's in the game.  If you do go high risk and throw, you don't throw up the middle. Especially with a QB under 6 feet tall.    The clock was not ""well less"" than a minute when they got to the goal line.  Seattle chose to burn time, which telegraphed everything because they had to score a touchdown.  A failed run at 20 seconds would mean a hurry up spike and then a ""miracle play"".  This told Bill a throw was a high possibility, notice Bill never used his last time out to conserve time??  It was like a game of chicken between the coaches and Seattle lost.  Seattle should have never burned the clock when it was at 48 seconds."

When I'm tired stuff like that makes me chuckle.  Honestly, it is neither my utter stupidity nor intended as sardonic. Same thing with quidditch remark: football, just like soccer, surrounds quite bizarre language for someone who rarely can experience it. First time I watched it on TV commentator sounded like Bill Cosby with slanting, veering and zibba-zabbing all over the place ;).  EDIT: Plus, being entirely honest, I have visited a lot of places and outside of the USA the american football is not particularly popular. I think rugby variant is a bit more popular but still far from mainstream. Assuming that USA citizens will be the ones with explanations and would provide the answer was more then grounded. Soccer is far more popular, I think that one of the reasons is the fact that you can practice it with a ball and two jackets posing as a goal. Without the need to wear armour."

venturebros,2uh8e2,Eso8910,6,Mon Feb 2 04:38:33 2015 UTC,Eh the throw was the correct call. It's the execution that's flawed. The short version is it creates an extra play to score and eats clock. I can write up something longer if anyone's curious.
venturebros,2uh8e2,n9ucs,3,Mon Feb 2 08:24:43 2015 UTC,I'm curious.
venturebros,2uh8e2,uconnhusky,3,Mon Feb 2 11:38:02 2015 UTC,"I actually wrote this up for another post. I actually changed my mind a little bit about it too. Post's lightly edited:  I'm saying pass was the correct call. Not that that play was the correct call. I think that slant should be run to free space in the corner and hopefully have a 1 on 1 in the corner.  I like that pass because you throw it to the right spot or you over throw it. That said it would take time to develop and they could be risking a sack.  If you look above to my first post (in another thread)you'll see I said   A pass was the correct call there btw. Just not to that receiver. He should only be running that route to clear space elsewhere.   I can think of several times that exact slant has worked though. And further immediately after the game Belichick was asked about it and he said it was a normal goal line look. And he said it really taken aback like he didn't understand the question. And all that's because it was a completely normal goal line play. Pete Carroll has forgotten more about football than I ever will know. So if him and Wilson like the look they're getting they can throw it. It obviously didn't work out either way.  edit: I'm just now looking back at the play. Here's some things I didn't see live. (Stupid close camera).  Setting up the game there's 26 seconds on the clock and both teams have 2 time outs. Seattle has the ball. It's second down on the 1 yard line.  Seattle's thought process. If you run the ball you basically only have two plays to get it in because the clock runs. But if you call a pass you get an extra play. If there's no one there whatever throw it away. If there's a touch down awesome. Figure a pass is 6-8 seconds of game clock. if it's incomplete the clock stops and there's 18 seconds. So now you're 3rd and 1 and have a strong running game to run half back dives. Run the ball don't make it again. 12 seconds tick. Timeout. 6 seconds left. Run the ball to end the game.   Seattle has 1 RB and 3 WR and 1 TE on the field. That's a set that can pass or run the ball. But it's better at passing, especially when the defense calls a run stop. I'd imagine that the play call let's Wilson audible into different runs based on what the defense shows.  The Pats have their goal line run stop in on the field. Basically 6 linemen with 2 playing run support in the middle and 3 on contain/pass defense. They thought it was HB run the whole way. It's especially obvious after the play begins.   Wilson sees 6 players on the line and thinks it's definite pass. The play has 89 block for 83. That's a pretty normal goal line play. Look at where Butler (the corner who intercepted)was when Wilson throws. Butler reads and makes a GREAT play on the ball. He goes to the perfect spot. I didn't realize it was that good live.  That's what everyone's missing. It wasn't a bad or wrong play call. It was an exceptional athletic moment  Here's the last play for your enjoyment."

Anyway, in the moments just before that play, I was more concerned that Belichik was pissing away the clock without calling timeout. He let 30 seconds go by before getting extremely lucky with the interception / no score."
venturebros,2uh8e2,theforkofdamocles,2,Mon Feb 2 14:39:45 2015 UTC,I think Belichick decided to rely completely on his defense. He figured it was goal line stand or bust. As proof he had his run defense (basically a ton of linemen). Plus they'd had some success stopping Lynch.   So 26 seconds left with 1 timeout. Figure the Seahawks run twice and the game's won or lost right there.

The characters are very one-dimensional here (Dr. Venture - the shitty father-scientist, Brock - the cold killing machine who doesn't say much, Hank and Dean -  obnoxious '70s cartoon character parodies, The Monarch - incompetent villain), and the overall plot just isn't very interesting. Though it is kind of interesting to hear Dr. Girlfriend and Billy Quizboy voiced by someone other than Doc Hammer, and it's kinda cool to see Billy, Pete White, and Professor Impossible before they were even named.   That being said, the part where they try to take Brock's knife at the UN is still pretty great. Brock came off as genuinely terrifying in this scene."

The pilot is a big, largely unfunny, mess that, by the grace of god, made it to air and any problems that people can point out about early VB are on full display here.   Perfect example: Hank and Dean as clueless Hardy Boy knock-offs, not funny; Hank and Dean as Hank and Dean, hysterical. Though, like with any project, it takes time to find the proper voice for any character and most shows never come close to the glory that has become the inter-personal relationships in the VBVerse."

""What are we going to do about Poops!"" I think this is the only real time we ever see Scamp(s) ""..and you'll be sure to find them in...New York City""  Hank, Dean, Rusty and especially The Monarch weren't complete.  The boys stay this way for awhile as we will see their ignorance into the next episode.  The Monarch had his style persona, but that costume was so bad. The overall message of the show was on full display; DR. Venture thinks he is on Jonas Sr's level, but he is a failure. The boys are dumb, something BIG is up with them. The Monarch has dumb schemes (ACID MAGNET!) and dumb henchmen, which Brock takes care of.  Not my 1st Venture view.  Seeing HELPeR hand Dean an un'frozen fun Pop, was it for me! Hooked since!"

They're boys, after all, and I think this episode shows immediately the kind of sheltered they are due to this lifestyle.  They seem straight out of an early cartoon, or like an homage to Leave It to Beaver or other shows in that vein.  It's not all that surprising when you consider they sleep in learning beds that were designed for their father some 30 years prior.  This episode is a great intro into their world of comic book-like super villains and globetrotting on adventures.  It's showcases itself as an adult show for fans of Jonny Quest quite well.

venturebros,2uhlgc,dtract,2,Wed Feb 4 23:56:48 2015 UTC,"It's not all that surprising when you consider they sleep in learning beds that were designed for their father some 30    You know thats something I had never really considered, interesting"
venturebros,2uhlgc,aphidman,5,Thu Feb 5 23:01:30 2015 UTC,"This episode isn't really canon, right?  Anyway, it has some decent gags. A couple OP mentioned. I also liked the joke about their absentee mother and the Monarch's run in with real citizens. But it's a pretty weak episode otherwise.  Brock and Rusty seem quite different than their portrayal in the first episode of Season 1. Doc's addiction to pills seems to be more of a focus and Brock's disregard of the boys, in the post-credits scene, seems out of character.  Another thing that makes the episode seem a bit stale is the lack of background music or audio - making silent parts a lot more noticeable and making the episode feel rather dead.  Also the title refers to Turtle Bay where the UN headquarters are located in New York."
venturebros,2uhlgc,LegacyLemur,2,Mon Feb 2 20:57:22 2015 UTC,"I personally feel it is considered cannon as monarch and Hank under the guise of Super Villain, RUSSIAN GUYOVITCH both have worn the monarch's original costume in flashbacks and at cremation creak respectively."
venturebros,2uhlgc,aphidman,2,Tue Feb 3 00:04:44 2015 UTC,I think they're just nods to the pilot. I believe they said something about it on the commentary but I don't have my DVD at hand... but looking up the pilot it seems to be mentioned that the creators don't really consider it canon. But I can't seem to find a quote.
venturebros,2uhlgc,The-Red-Panda,1 point,Mon Feb 2 10:22:24 2015 UTC,They reference it in a later episode where Monarch is talking about his old days henching to the council of 13 and in the flashbacks he's wearing the old Monarch outfit he wore in the pilot
venturebros,2uhlgc,aingai,1 point,Mon Feb 2 20:12:22 2015 UTC,I don't think it's actually the same costume. Do you have a screengrab? I don't have Season 3 at hand.
venturebros,2uhlgc,drgirlfriend_,6,Mon Feb 2 23:33:36 2015 UTC,"Everything About the Pilot screams ""Mediocore"" and honestly if This was the first Episode I saw, I would probably not watch the rest of the series  That being said.......Mediocrity aside, the Pilot here serves its purpose, it gives us a general cast of characters and their motivations.  Joke Wise its pretty lame, with a  few good one liners here and there, although I have to admit Brock as a mindless murder machine in this episode perfectly parodies the borderline Psychopathic mannerisms of the body guards in old action cartoons, If it weren't for that mummy Defiling scene I might have not continued to watch  All in all, although my least favorite episode, It definitely is an important setup for the characters in the rest of the series"
venturebros,2uhlgc,detentist,4,Thu Feb 5 11:19:54 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite quotes of the series. ""Ma Venture didn't raise no fools!""  Edit: They made it clear pretty early that doc is a Johnny Quest-like character, only more demented.  The first science we see him doing is related to pharmaceutical animal testing.  Edit 2: Man the animation was rough around the edges.  Compared to how good the special looked at least.  Edit 3: ""That's no butterfly, it's that guy who's always hating dad!""  Edit 4: ""The applications are limitless!"" This episode is so quotable!  Edit 5: It's really awesome to see so many of these characters so early.  One of my favorite things about the show is that they've been able to develop all the characters so much over the seasons.  It reminds me of what some of the long running comic book series have done with their characters.  They start out campy and flat and develop so much over time that the newest iteration looks nothing like the original."
venturebros,2uhlgc,ChetBenning,3,Thu Feb 5 11:39:06 2015 UTC,"Coming back to this episode directly after re-watching ATAG2, it’s pretty incredible to see how much the animation has improved over the years. I kind of find Hank and Dean weirdly endearing in this episode, although I think my love of them is being clouded by how much their personalities subsequently developed (Hank especially). However, I can see how annoying they would’ve gotten had they continued being so clueless.   From the get-go, the pacing in this episode is pretty bad. Jokes don’t land where they’re supposed to, the music cues are a little off, and everything seems awkward. One of the only jokes that lands well, in part due to the pacing,  is “Hank, we don’t have a mom.” The brief silence afterwards kills me every time.    Speaking of music, the song that plays during the trip to New York is pretty great.   Brock’s bloodlust face is really unsettling.  Every voice but Brock’s is a little different from its final form, Hank and Dean’s voices are slightly deeper here, the Monarch isn’t as shrill, and Rusty doesn’t sound as snarky. Then obviously, Dr. Girlfriend, Billly Quizboy and Professor Impossible are voiced by different people. Pete White’s more or less the same as well.   There's a pretty substantial difference in Rusty’s personality, there’s a much larger focus on his pill addiction, and he’s a lot less cynical. He also seems a lot more into super science. Brock is extremely indifferent towards his bodyguard job, and he’s pretty cold towards the boys. Kind of makes me like him a little less.   I’m pretty sure that if we could have flair on the sub, mine would read  “pretty girl science”   Some of my favourite lines: “I was in the mommy place”  “It’s that guy who’s always hated dad!!”  “Aw, it melted all the little people and stuff, awwww”  “The fleshy jig of the mommy and daddy dance”   Overall, TTOTB is a pretty mediocre episode, and definitely not the one to show your friends first. It’s pretty cool to see how many things have been called back to over the years, and I think it does an okay job at setting up the world that the Ventures live in. On a letter grade scale, it’s like a C+."
venturebros,2uhlgc,jesuschrist64,5,Tue Feb 3 00:01:46 2015 UTC,"I saw it when it came out, when it was just a pilot, and AS was testing to see what new shows they'd make. I don't remember any of the other ones, but when I heard they were going to pick this up as a series, I was excited.  This episode was really funny at the time. It really was ahead of the curve. It took an old idea, Johnny Quest, and merged it with a more serious, realistic world - ala all the superhero stuff that is happening now.  Granted, after 10+ years of Ventures, this episode is stiff and sucky. Even at the time I could tell the animation was rough, obviously done in Flash by one or two guys. But through all that, it was new and funny. And the title sequence intro was great, I think it really showed the potential of the show.  Now, no, it doesn't really hold up. The difference between the pilot and the first real episode is night and day!"
venturebros,2uhlgc,tinook,3,Tue Feb 3 03:21:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other posters who say that the pilot is a shadow of the series' total glory. However, I would rebut that by episode 3, the show hits its stride, with moments that rival what we'll see in later seasons. Compare this to shows like The Simpsons which had a series of shorts and two full seasons to finally get on the ball."
venturebros,2uhlgc,MagicalHamster,3,Tue Feb 3 19:56:35 2015 UTC,This was the first episode I saw and I actually really liked it. While it was very rough I thought it was still a funny episode. Highlights for me were any time Hank and Dean used any sort of old-fashioned lingo or whenever the Monarch would use incorrect metaphors/similes. Also the mother joke at the beginning of the episode is more or less what hooked me.

venturebros,2uhj3u,fenshield,4,Tue Feb 3 04:04:33 2015 UTC,"So, so many favorites.  I think Jefferson Twilight has some of the funniest moments in the series, in particular during ""What Goes Down Must Come Up.""  I love when Orpheus and Al perform their incredibly dramatic magic rituals, then J.T. just looks around and says, ""And I'll check for Blackulas.  Nope, no Blackulas.""  Also, ""I gotta go where the blacktion is.""  Pretty much anything Dr. Killinger does.  I love when he overpowers Orpheus, telling him ""Your powers are useless on me, you silly billy,"" and of course the lightsaber battle with the Investors.  Hatred has plenty of great moments too.  My favorite is when he's leaving the Venture Compound after his unexpectedly cordial ""meet-and-greet,"" and abruptly shoots Rusty with a rubber bullet as a joke.  It was just so surprising and hilarious.  Plus, the whole Guild interview he does with Doc earlier in the episode (""Vicious attack dogs!"").  Not to mention the time he counter-acted the affects of a dozen tranquilizer darts by injecting himself with pure adrenaline, or when he forced Hank to shoot him to earn his respect.  I really, really like when The Monarch and Dr. Mrs. The Monarch save Billy and Rusty during the party at Don Hell's.  Such an awesome entrance.  And if we're doing Monarch moments now, we've got: ""I forgot...oh yeah, it's 'I'm the fucking Monarch!""; the whole ""wrong address"" fiasco; and the Scared Straight scene.  I should cut it off there.  And I will."

Watch ""From the Ladle to the Grave: The Shallow Gravy Story"" and then ""A Very Venture Halloween"" before starting Season 5's ""What Colour is my Cleansuit?""

Without a father figure, he has all of these wrong ideas of what it means to be a man, while ""normal"" for Hank and Dean is confronting your own clone or getting molested by guys in costumes.

venturebros,2tzrkq,MagicalHamster,14,Wed Jan 28 19:16:11 2015 UTC,"They're getting pretty damn competent at this point. The future's looking pretty good, I'd say.   Dean was all pouty about it, but he's growing up and finding his way. Rusty's really the main thing holding him back, with the whole insistence on super science. I think he'd eventually break out of the entire stupid spandex-and-raygun lifestyle and become a happy guy that would make for a boring show. Even though he wants to be a reporter, the show kind of gives off the hint that he'd be happy as a scientist, just without the ""super"" part.  Hank, man. He'd excel in the exact opposite way. He's like if Rusty grew up with a brother and without emotional baggage. If he ever grows out of specifically idolizing Brock and whatever organization he's with, he'd be all set. He's probably on par with an untrained 18 year old Shore Leave.  Hell, instead of imagining them as Rusty's age, just think of Rusty at college age. Totally useless, with a sick inheritance and some serious demons and self-delusion going on.  e: That said, it'd be an entirely different story if they still had their clones, or had Invincible Murder Guy protecting them. They would've just grown up to be Season 1-3 Hank and Dean, just taller."
venturebros,2tzrkq,wellgolly,14,Wed Jan 28 21:01:22 2015 UTC,"This man stole from your father, teach him the meaning of loyalty!  I loved how Killinger treated the boy's.  Dean is becoming lamer and lamer and will eventually turn into the house husband the Master showed Triana.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynpHaLJzb5s  Hank will probably become a OSI agent.  He will probably think he deserves to be at the top with Brock, but will never amount to more than a soldier.  Maybe he joins The New Guild?  Killinger will teach him the ways!  Or Doc and Hammer just kill them off again, and then laugh at us!"
venturebros,2tzrkq,SuperSmokingMonkey,6,Wed Jan 28 19:48:16 2015 UTC,"Dean has always been lame, though. He's the lame one. I think with him finding his own identity he might finally find something...interesting. I'm hoping he'll at least turn out more competent and less angry than Rusty.  I feel like one of these days we might see the boys' polarities switch. Suddenly Dean will be popular with the ladies and Hank will be made fun of or something."
venturebros,2tzrkq,ProtoJMan,12,Wed Jan 28 20:34:21 2015 UTC,"Watch the scenes with him and doc in the special. You can see they're trying to show some new competence and interest in science stuff.  Dean is going to fall in somewhere between Rusty and JJ. He'll always be a bit meek, but that's what Hank is for."
venturebros,2tzrkq,teslasmash,2,Wed Jan 28 23:07:09 2015 UTC,Totally! Dean fixed H.E.L.P.E.R. all by himself! Those learning beds must have given him something of a knowledge in robotics enough to undo his father's frankenstein H.E.L.P.E.R.

venturebros,2tzrkq,sky4,3,Thu Jan 29 00:50:21 2015 UTC,"I feel like one of these days we might see the boys' polarities switch. Suddenly Dean will be popular with the ladies and Hank will be made fun of or something.   Dean is already more popular with the ladies, they actually talked to him when Hank took him to the mall while Hank just pretended to know all the girls. Also, remember the Quymn twins. Dean hasn't lost his virginity like Hank has, but that's more for a lack of trying than a lack of popularity."
venturebros,2tzrkq,racebateman,2,Thu Jan 29 09:40:09 2015 UTC,"Right. But given the theme of ""failure"" I would say that they are two sides of the same failure coin with a smattering of ""wins"" in between.  Hank got laid... but to his half-brother's mom! Dean was so mad he didn't french kiss a girl and then french kissed a girl in the same episode but doesn't remember it! Citing Season 4 and 5.  So the boys are just as lucky as they are unlucky IMO.  It's not that their characters are flawed but that the plot elements always twist their wins wit h the ladies into something of a loss."
venturebros,2tzrkq,Lobstrositiesbitme,3,Fri Jan 30 02:51:26 2015 UTC,"Dean is pretty jaded, though. I can see him looking at how his father failed to fill his grandfather's shoes, and decide not to make the same mistake - and he turns to supervillany instead. With the assets left to Rusty from Jonas Jr., he could probably make a good run of it, too."
venturebros,2tzrkq,jabbercocky,6,Thu Jan 29 01:02:53 2015 UTC,"I hope with the conclusion of the special, they will all move to NYC and have some freedom to branch out individually. If it wasn't that the show revels in tragedy and misfortune, I'd say that leaving the compound is like leaving prison for all of them. Rusty will be rejuvenated with new ideas, Dean will flourish with his own super science projects, Hank will... be Hank. Yeeeeah! It'll be great! A new start!  ...but chances are Rusty will squander the opportunity and lose all the money, Dean will inevitably clash with his father over a project and Hank... Hank'll be fine, maybe he'll get famous with his band."
venturebros,2tzrkq,neish,3,Wed Jan 28 22:30:12 2015 UTC,"So, I have a weird theory about this. So, one of the major themes in this show is failure, right?   I think the boys will become failures at becoming failures. I think they will fail to live up to their father's expectations, who is, in fact himself a failure. I see Hank becoming the next big shot bad-ass Brock Samson. I see Dean becoming the next Jonas Jr., a wildly successful super-scientist philanthropist, fulfilling the destiny that Rusty could't.  And as an aside, I don't see Triana becoming this big shot necromancer. I think that's been too hyped up for her with her mother and father's legacy. I think she'll become her own person, perhaps removed from all the good/evil hullabaloo."
venturebros,2tzrkq,thesodasquire,7,Thu Jan 29 08:24:04 2015 UTC,Hank will ultimately fail at being a super-spy and open up Hank Co.
venturebros,2tzrkq,OleBarnCat,10,Wed Jan 28 19:24:03 2015 UTC,He IS surprisingly competent with Hank Co. so far.
venturebros,2tzrkq,enrjon,7,Wed Jan 28 19:26:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know, he was also somewhat competent as a spy as shown when shoreleave and huntergathers gave him that ""spy test"" and he passed with flying colors. Too bad he has to be 18 to join."

venturebros,2tzrkq,ChetBenning,8,Wed Jan 28 19:58:02 2015 UTC,"If comments made by Myra have any weight, it's also possible the boys' ages have been screwed up over 14 generations."
venturebros,2tzrkq,scottmill,3,Wed Jan 28 22:29:52 2015 UTC,"At the start of season 2, when the ""new"" Venture Bros (clones) are woken up for the first time, Brock gives them their old burnt up IDs and tells them to put them in their wallets, and Rusty and Brock wish them happy 16th birthday.  Dean points out that the IDs say they're 19, and Doc tells him curiosity killed more than the cat.    The boys were born 19+ years ago, but there are some gaps of a few months between each death and bringing the clones back that would account for the missing 3 years."
venturebros,2tzrkq,The-Red-Panda,2,Thu Jan 29 03:52:14 2015 UTC,That'll happen when you have 14 sets of clones
venturebros,2tzrkq,RogueRaven17,2,Thu Jan 29 02:01:48 2015 UTC,I thought that it wasn't that he wasn't 18 - he just didn't have his high school diploma.

venturebros,2tzrkq,Wwwi7891,5,Fri Jan 30 17:30:26 2015 UTC,"If he does fail, I don't think it will be for lack of skill. I mean he's not even 18, and he still managed to go all predator on a band of armed guerrilla mutants while stranded in the jungle with nothing but a jetpack and coffee beans."
venturebros,2tzrkq,disingenuous_hugs,2,Wed Jan 28 21:30:45 2015 UTC,He is skilled but I think it will be his temperament that wont allow him to truly be a super-spy. Throwing up at Zero's dead body makes me think his is not hard enough for the lifestyle.
venturebros,2tzrkq,Rathmar,2,Thu Jan 29 02:34:24 2015 UTC,"Perhaps this isn't the best place for this, but it made me think of an old theory I had.  It may have just been art style similarities, but I do remember at least one or two scenes with OSI agents who looked and acted like they could be grown up Hank/Dean clones.  One in particular I think was wearing a cape with his dress uniform, and not one that looked like it belonged.  Is this something that has already been explored or explained and I missed out?   I remember this being in the episode where Hatred was working for the OSI as a double agent for the GCI.  Perhaps I'm just thinking of Hatred, but does this ring a bell for anyone else?  I suppose the original point I meant to connect, was that if this were true... are we even certain that Dean and Hank ever spent much time as children/adolescents?  I don't think any of the flashbacks ever showed them as younger than they are at the start of the series.   Edit:  Found the picture I was looking for here"
venturebros,2tzrkq,Syphon8,1 point,Wed Jan 28 23:18:28 2015 UTC,One of the episodes with Myra shows them as babies.
venturebros,2tzrkq,Rathmar,3,Wed Jan 28 23:32:50 2015 UTC,"However, wasn't that a 'Myra Flashback' meaning the integrity of what was contained within... questionable at best?"
venturebros,2tzrkq,Phoequinox,2,Wed Jan 28 23:53:56 2015 UTC,"They have potential, and I think the show's creators know that. The show is based around them, and in the last couple of seasons, we've seen them start to grow a little more useful. Dean looks like he'll grow to be much more stable and caring than Rusty or his dad. He has a good heart, he just doesn't have good influences. Hank's influence is Brock, and so, he has a strong desire for action. And after seeing he aced his SPHINX training, he looks like he's on the right track. Dean's influence is Rusty, who is a complete and utter mess. Dean seems to maintain a positive outlook, albeit terribly whiny. If Dean manages to inherit his father's genius without his arrogance, he's likely to surpass everyone else in the show.   Hank, on the other hand, seems to be a bit too much of a loose cannon. He will more than likely grow to become more competent and effective at fighting as time goes on, but I feel as though he'll drift towards the villainous side because of his love of fighting and rebellion, in contrast to Dean's want for peace and respect. The series will likely see them becoming the most pivotal roles for their respective sides. There has been a very strong hero/villain narrative since season 2, and because of that, I think there will be a huge emphasis put on the two brothers in that regard. Right now, Dean is null. He basically exists as a placeholder. Hank is ambitious, but too young and inept to be taken seriously. The next two seasons will start to sculpt them, I think."
venturebros,2tzrkq,scottmill,1 point,Fri Jan 30 07:33:01 2015 UTC,"I really think Dean's going to grow up to fill Jonas Venture's role.  Actually, I think between the two of them, Hank and Dean will cover the super-science and the adventurer roles their grandfather played.  Rusty probably would have been okay if his father hadn't died when he was in college and he had any sort of guidance: have they ever told us what Rusty's twenties were like, other than OSI sent Myra to bodyguard for a panicked, directionless Rusty Venture?"

Hank can become a OSI agent or henchman and be a solid mix of brock and 21. badass but super nerdy. have lots of potential but never fully realized."

I don't imagine Doc going murderous over the death of his brother; he clearly saw that J.J. was sacrificing himself heroically by choice and doesn't need revenging.  If anything, I think the person pictured is more likely an alternate universe Doc, like the one at the end of ""Everyone Comes to Hank's"" and ""Bright Lights, Dean City""."
venturebros,2trs5u,McGravin,9,Tue Jan 27 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"Uh well, he had to sacrifice himself because the Guild set off the reactor, so some revenge would be appropriate.

venturebros,2trs5u,toxicroach,14,Tue Jan 27 03:01:12 2015 UTC,"Right, but that's really out of character for Doc. I just don't see it happening.  Maybe some major event could cause such a shift in Doc's personality, but I think it would take way more than his brother's death (by the way, anyone else less than convinced that J.J. and Hulk Treister are really dead?). He certainly didn't express any thoughts of revenge at the funeral, which would seem the logical place to espouse such views."
venturebros,2trs5u,McGravin,4,Tue Jan 27 03:18:48 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think Rusty could be an instrument of revenge, as long as you remember that this still image doesn't really have too much to do with how its acted out.   Yes its out of character for him to go on a killing spree but his life has been sooo fukt with. While he's used to that everyone has a breaking point.   He wouldn't be an action hero like Gary or Brock, but a character that just kind of stumbles through being a hero in the same way he stumbles through being a super scientist.   The Guild puts out this propaganda cause ""shit he killed all our guys"" but really it was just a fault in the construction of the secret lair while Rusty was infiltrating it and knocked into a loose bolt. Weaponizing his shit luck. U kno it'd be great."
venturebros,2trs5u,20000Deths,5,Tue Jan 27 16:20:12 2015 UTC,"I definitly don't think JJ is dead, an offscreen death is really uncharacteristic of most permanent deaths in the series"

venturebros,2trs5u,The-Red-Panda,8,Tue Jan 27 13:37:58 2015 UTC,"Yea, but, what would be the point of him surviving?  He was dying regardless, he had no energy, he was on his last legs regardless.  Going out in Gargantua-2 would be him dying on his own terms.  Dean asked if he was going to make it out in the last moment to confirm all of our fears, but no one had the heart to reply.

I don't see how killing all the Council members helps with the Investors.  He wanted to do an assault on them on Gargantua 2 which doesn't really make any sense (as far as we've seen you can't even touch them) and didn't require the Council to be liquidated.

Everything and everyone was carefully orchestrated at the precise moments they needed to to crescendo to the the Return of the Jedi sized battle between the ancient Greek winds, his brothers, the Investors.  This episode is the bridge between season 4 and 5 to propel the show to season 6 with entirely new dynamics. Not just for Rusty and the boys, but the whole Ventureverse. Which is awesome.   I can't wait for more, but since it's the best show on television, and as tight and awesome as the special is - I'll gladly say ""take your time, guys. Take your time. You're doing great work."""

It doesn't appear he has particularly malevolent intentions, unless he's playing a really good long game (and obviously he is playing a long game already, I mean longer than it already appears) I'd personally compare him to Gandalf, more than Palpatine. It seems like he's just trying to maintain order in the world than do anything for his own personal needs. But who knows, maybe I'm just being fooled by him."

Additionally, I think since Rusty is now rich/in charge of a big business and since the Guild is mixing shit up I think Brock goes back to a bodyguard in some capacity"
venturebros,2tjnp7,HurricaneUhScrambles,16,Sat Jan 24 21:05:56 2015 UTC,"Colonel Gentleman, Humongoloid and Action Man are fighting Brainulo in a flashback in Devil's Grip. Rather than play the cliche, he has them fight their crushes (Triple Threat and Jazz). Action man reveals he wants to show Rose (Triple Threat) his filth.... so let's assume Colonel has the hots for Jazz. Could that be Venturion before the plane crash?  Which - stay with me here - would also be the pin that moves the theory that Monarch and Rusty are the Venture Bros. Well, half-brothers, because Jazz would have never touched, let alone Fathered, his own son. Which would run exactly parallel to Rusty's half sister... Dr. Quymm  After the plane crash Jonas Venture Sr. felt responsible or got involved. ""Pulled some strings,"" as Brock said it in Bot Meets Bot - (which is way off against his type seeing as how he left the orphans to die in the MOTHR incident) So he turned Monarch's dad into Venturion. Maybe it was to babysit Monarch and Rusty --  And there was a blanking of little boy Monarch's memory (proven technology that exists in the Ventureverse and used hilariously by SPHINX). The fact Monarch doesn't even remember being on the compound with little Rusty with his parents really freaked him out in SPHINX Rising.  Also worth noting - In Bright lights, Dean City, Doc's musical had the lyrics, ""The dreams I've buried with robot fingers, they linger!"" When Doc sees Brock in Vendata's armor he shouts, ""the metal murder man from my nightmares!"" We also got confirmation in Bot Meets Bot - Venturion tried to choke Rusty. So, there's a mystery to look forward to.  So now - new question - why did Venturion ""turn"" ~ What did Rusty do that was so horrible? Maybe Rusty was somehow responsible for the plane crash... maybe a little plastic toy melted into the control panel of the plane?   AND - after Venturion turned to Vendata, perhaps that's when HELPeR was born/built?"
venturebros,2tjnp7,blaspheminCapn,4,Sat Jan 24 22:00:04 2015 UTC,I agree with everything EXCEPT that Jass/Jazz is the Monarch's father. I don't think there's that many connections linking the two.   It seems all but certain (at least we are lead to believe) that Vendata was the Monarch's father.
venturebros,2tjnp7,vlee89,5,Mon Jan 26 06:39:55 2015 UTC,It doesn't confirm anything but there is a character in one of the flashbacks in Spanakopita! that bears a strong resemblance to Jass/Jazz.

venturebros,2tjnp7,aphidman,10,Tue Feb 3 22:26:17 2015 UTC,"Just Finished off my Binge watching of the entire series for the first time with the special:  I'm more confused than I have ever been  Why did the Sovereign pull a 180 and go full Chaotic Evil just to get Rid of the Investors? When was it established he made a deal with the Investors? His motives are so contradictory to his character, I understand that he's evil, being the head of the Guild and all, but he was never ""Blow up innocents"" evil  Why did JJ make a Deal with the investors? What could he Possibly have gotten from them that he couldn't have done himself?   Minor, but Where Watch and Ward planning an actual Cou against the Sovereign before the whole ""Blow up Gargantua 2"" plan? or was this just a convenient plot device to have the only 2 wet workers of the Guild to get put into the new council of 13?"
venturebros,2tjnp7,The-Red-Panda,7,Sun Jan 25 14:42:31 2015 UTC,"I think the idea behind The Sovereign's sudden change was that he was so afraid of The Investors that he was willing to forsake everything he had once believed in for a chance at escaping them. While we still don't know the nature of his deal with them or exactly what the investors are (Greek winds references notwithstanding) he clearly was fighting for his life, or more likely, his soul.  As for JJ's deal with the investors it's anyone's guess at this point. My personal theory is that his deal had something to do with gaining the ability to escape Rusty's body as a person rather than a tumor. But we don't know yet.  I think Watch and Ward started planning the coup once they put it together that the Sovereign was going to kill off the guild. They represent the status quo bureaucracy of the Guild and the Sovereign was forsaking that whole system."
venturebros,2tjnp7,Ktrout743,4,Sun Jan 25 02:56:25 2015 UTC,"I Get that the Sovereign is Afraid of them, but without knowing the specifics of the deal its kindve a moot point, its the same problem with JJ, what did the Investors give him that he couldn't have got himself? People like Monstroso or Billy needed them because they couldn't have gotten a suitable heart of a PhD any other way  Your Point about JJ Though......that is something that's actually an interesting prospect.......In Return to Spider Skull Island Rusty Calls him a hemorrhoid and comments on how he usually goes back down after ahile, perhaps he did make a deal with the investors to become a ""Real boy""  Yah that seems likely for Watch and Ward, I like them anyway, so im glad they have a place in the new Council of 13"
venturebros,2tjnp7,The-Red-Panda,12,Sun Jan 25 03:20:55 2015 UTC,"Well it seems like the Investors are the Ventureverse take on the devil. Tons of folklore is devoted to the notion of a mortal making a deal with the devil. This deal will give them something amazing that they couldn't obtain by themselves, but comes at terrible (and often ironic) price. The Sovereign identified himself as someone who wanted to be anyone but who what he was. Maybe the Investors gave him his shapeshifting ability, which may have facilitated his rise to the position of Sovereign."

venturebros,2tjnp7,stotch89,4,Sun Jan 25 23:28:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think JJ made a deal with the Investors.   His line was: ""Perhaps later would be a good time to review those... terms.""  That tells me he didn't sign anything concrete witht them. JJ was either going to make a deal with the devil type of situation, or perhaps he was going to sell them a bigger slice of Venture Industries.   However. I'm pretty sure that unless it happened off screen, they didn't move forward with it in the end, due to JJ AND the Investor's deaths.

Publick: I think you and I are both sick of every interview mentioning the “It’s a show about failure” from five years ago. I don’t think we made a conscious effort to fight that or anything, but every year, we push what we do as writers a little more. An area we hadn’t gone into very much was positivity. I mean, all our victories are still satiric, but there are definitely places where we said, “I want to see these guys do something. I don’t want to just have everything fall on its face all the time.   I think, in light of that, it's pretty clear ""failure"" isn't the central theme it used to be."

venturebros,2tjnp7,alilja,-1,Sun Jan 25 05:10:15 2015 UTC,"He was not funny in his first episode on Spider skull island. The banter about Zero was funny. He was just annoying in the episode where he is kidnapping everyone, and he was sorta a thrown in on the revenge society. Look at all the other characters on the series super freaking interesting, and original. Zero is just a hench who gt lucky like 24, 21, Kevin, Tim-Tom, or even Speedy if we want to go way back. Zero was just some super weird, really drug out crap of a henchman joke.   Even Keven, and Tim-Tom had the whole creepy perverse, little person, kinda half incest might actually be man children thing with Dr.Girlfriend/Mrs the monarch.   Zero is just not a good character, his fist appearance was acceptable, his second was boring, and this last one was only worthwhile because they killed him."

venturebros,2tjnp7,SageOfTheWise,2,Sun Jan 25 05:32:35 2015 UTC,"I actually like Scott Hall/Zero. He was an interesting counterpoint to 21/24 and one of the better examples of the crapshoot nature of the Ventureverse.  Look at him, highly competent, serious, by-the-book. And he fails or otherwise comes up short. Compared to Seasons 1-3 Era 21 and 24 who were bumbling, nerdy, and just trying to skate by under the radar and accidentally fall backwards into succeeding at whatever mission the Monarch sends them on (but never so successful that their station in life changes, nor do they bungle things up to incur his wrath).  I loved Every Which Way But Zeus because it showed he was capable of mass scale disruption and the whole spiderskull island events really pushed him into antagonist territory. And it was an awesome excuse to get top brass from the Guild, OSI, SPHINX, and the Revenge Society (as well as the Peril Partnership) in one room together.   Honestly he'd be a great rival to 'General 21', especially if 21 ever goes solo."
venturebros,2tjnp7,letter_of_resignatio,7,Mon Jan 26 03:20:25 2015 UTC,"I think what is most exciting about ATAG2 was the fact that Killinger will take a more involved role in the show. Along with that is what was revealed in the epilogue: That the Ventures are going to New York. I expect a revival of the Rusty Venture musical and the feuds with the Monarch, who is now living in New Jersey, will continue. Personally, I hope we see more from Watch and Ward in the upcoming season."
venturebros,2tjnp7,vlee89,2,Mon Jan 26 03:57:49 2015 UTC,I did not even make the whole Monarch-is-living-in-New-Jersey connection when they revealed the Ventures were going to NYC. Such consistency.
venturebros,2tjnp7,kokopelli73,6,Mon Jan 26 07:19:42 2015 UTC,"I can't help but feel Killinger/Sovereign are related some how. Sovereign makes many promises that seem to correlate with Killinger's actions. I don't have exact quotes, but I remember the Sovereign promising them that this was the Guild's finest hour. Basically LOTS of things that the Sovereign said seemed like he knew what was going to happen?  ANOTHER thing that I believe that strongly links the two, is after PL tells the Investors that the Sovereign told him to pull the plug on the ray shield. The Investors thought it was interesting, and they confront Killinger directly afterwards.  The Sovereign's speech to DMT Monarch before he left seemed kind of odd to me. I don't know how to describe it, but it just seemed like he was lying to her still.  Watch and Ward also never seemed too concerned about danger throughout the special. I'm not sure if it was for comedic purposes, but I get the feeling they just knew what was going on the whole time.  I originally thought Killinger=Sovereign, but now I realized that was silly. HOWEVER, I strongly believe there to be SOME sort of link between the two. Their actions/dialogue throughout the special just seem too connected... Try rewatching the special as if the Sovereign/Killinger are linked in a way and let me know what you think.  edit: The Sovereign also promises PL the Council, which it seems like a couple of the Revenge Society will definitely serve on!  The Investors ALSO say to Killinger, ""YOU have destroyed the Guild..."" before being stabbed. Sovereign seemingly killed off a lot of the guild members.  THE CONNECTIONS ARE THERE RIGHT?"
venturebros,2tjnp7,Kalgaidin,1 point,Sat Jan 31 19:06:49 2015 UTC,I'd never seen all the connections laid out like this. I think you're right — Killinger is pulling the strings. Maybe the Sovereign discovered that Killinger is related to the Investors and decided to clean house of everyone on the council who had ties to Killinger and be working for him?
venturebros,2tjnp7,tombob1,2,Sun Jan 25 07:25:06 2015 UTC,"I now believe that Jonas Sr. made some sort of deal with the investors. I don't have time to look up evidence, but I think it was for the key to cloning, possibly because Rusty had the same problems that Hank and Dean did (frequent death) when he was young.   ""Have a kid one day, Dean. Hold its lifeless body in your arms and then tell me how wrong it is. Your grandpap and I perfected genetic engineering because god, or whatever gave us a perfect map to do so."" - Ben, about Jonas Sr.   I don't think that development came out of nowhere.

venturebros,2tjnp7,Nilbop,4,Tue Feb 3 01:53:34 2015 UTC,The whole Jonas Jr / Investors plot seemed like it was building up to something sinister. Like JJ was going to do something really bad in exchange for better organs (Rusty's organs?). And then everyone involved just suddenly died?

venturebros,2tjnp7,IMarriedAVoxPopuli,3,Tue Jan 27 05:03:06 2015 UTC,"Long shot, but I had the thought that Killinger told The Monarch That can't be on the council of 13 was because he's making The Monarch new Sovereign.   With Rusty the new head of Venture Industries 2.0 who Better to be a foil for him then a Sovereign Monarch?  They'll both mess everything up, but that's the point."

I was sick of the Action Man and Billy's Mom in the season 5 finale and I'm extremely sick of them now. I'm sure they're two characters who are just there because Doc and Jackson like doing their voices, but ""old people who buck the old people trend"" is a tiresome joke to trot out again and again. It's nice to see Brock's OSI supporting cast getting more screen-time. I'm surprised little has been made that Brock and Amber appear to be sleeping together behind Headshot's back. Zero's death was a real let down for me and felt a bit petty. Hopefully it at least has some significance for Hank. I hope the Monarch gets a new team of non-faceless henchmen to play off him and 21, like Dr Phage's Pro-Teens. I also hope he gets on the Council. He's spent enough time paying his dues, and someone like Phantom Limb is definitely not that far above him anymore. I hope they push Hank to the OSI this season. Dean's a bit of a mess of a character so they can do whatever with him. I love the status-quo that the special and it's epilogue set-up. It feels very Fantastic-Foury."

venturebros,2tfuwi,Danzou,60,Fri Jan 23 20:31:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that stood out to me, too. But here's my thought: while the ray shield components were engineered and built by mutated interns at the Venture Compound, it was shipped off in parts and installed by normal humans on the Gargantua-2.  So when they were looking at the schematics and assembling the parts to attach to the station, they must have been puzzled by the double arm-holes on the manual override controls. Assuming that the intention there was to require two people to access it, they rerouted the second set of arm-holes to sit beside the first for ease of access.  So basically the engineers aboard the station went off-spec when confronted with a weird ergonomic issue they couldn't understand the original reasoning for."
venturebros,2tfuwi,DDSNeverSummer,45,Fri Jan 23 20:46:38 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that one set of arms went in the outside holes, the other set went in the two holes in the middle, closest to each other.

venturebros,2tfuwi,VehicularSodomy,5,Fri Jan 23 22:51:38 2015 UTC,I think this is correct. If you look at their arms that idea isn't much of a stretch. Left set of arms goes in the left plate. Right set of arms goes in the right plate. Mutant would be kind of bending down and hugging the shield generator.

venturebros,2te01f,mcdrunkin,6,Fri Jan 23 19:55:15 2015 UTC,"I love this shot, from season 4 to season 6 special we have seen Brock go from hardcore Swedish murder machine to hardcore Swedish murder machine with a paternal heart for the boys and to an extent Doc. I like to believe that he see's a much younger version of himself in Hank, probably grew up watching shows like Rusty Venture Boy Adventurer and always wanted to be that when he grew up but unlike Billy grew out of the disillusionment of the lifestyle that follows and tried to live a straight life until a certain incident in college. When the joined the army he forgot about it until he was recruited into the ranks of the OSI and taken under the wing of Colonel Hunter who became like a father to him, teaching him how to have the childhood dream of being a super spy adventurer while still being an adult.  Brock knows Hank wants his life and while he's trying to discourage him in various ways, either through buying him a guitar to let him creatively express himself or through a stern loving heart to heart because he knows how dangerous it is and without the clones now he could very much lose the closest thing he has to a family AND a son he could be proud of. We have yet to see how his home life is but clearly he thinks higher of Hank than the sum hundreds of bastard children he has fathered throughout the years. Hank is a younger version of Brock and more and more we are seeing it and what he will inevitably become when Brock is too old to keep going on regardless of how much he doesn't want it to happen.  Of course, there is also the possibility Doc and Jackson are quietly snooping through this forum and see it and suddenly it blows the whole thing out of the water later...super sorry for that...."
venturebros,2te01f,Zerovarner,8,Fri Jan 23 20:12:55 2015 UTC,Hank doesn't want to be Brock. Brocks cool but Brock is not Hank enough. Hank wants to be the Bat. The Bat is Hank enough.

venturebros,2tel91,alyTemporalAnom,6,Fri Jan 23 21:49:34 2015 UTC,"Fair point but I'm sticking to what i said.   Hank and Dean did die, and the two who died that day stayed dead. They died so the show could establish the clone plot point. Treister died to be sad. Hank and Dean's death was probably different than anything that will ever happen in the show again.  And it's true that Colonel Gentleman and Scott Hall had fake deaths, but they weren't dramatic or important like Treisters. When Colonel Gentleman died the show did not ask you to care, it just brushed over it, and Scott Hall's death was a joke. When Treister and Jonas blew up it was supposed to make you feel sad, so bringing them back would cheapen the emotions that went into that. Plus Gentleman and Scott ""died"" off screen while you watched Treister explode.   All I'm saying is Treister coming back would feel forced and a bit deus ex machina, which are words I would never imagine using to describe Venture Brothers. So I'm pretty sure he's not coming back. I get your point about people having come back before and yeah I did forget about those guys when I wrote what I did, but this is an extremely different situation."

venturebros,2tel91,trashbagman,2,Sat Jan 24 13:53:03 2015 UTC,"yeah idk about timtom and kevin, they could be dead but im not sure. but forget what i first said, i was wrong, people have been implied to die in venture bros and come back and i recede to that. sorry i was wrong about that but that wasnt the point i was trying to make. it would still be really stupid to bring someone back in any tv show after giving them a dramatic and heroic death like that. the point i was trying to make was not its impossible to come back to life in venture brothers, its that bringing treister back would completely negate all emotions that went into his death. that goes, like, triple for jonas, his death was really sad. also he was dying anyway, so what do you guys think is gonna happen? hes gonna come back and then die again? hes gonna get his cancer cured and everything is fine? does that really sound like venture bros?  this was much more like 24s death. when he died, it was sad. people were sad about it in the show and in real life. that is how they treated the death of treister and jonas. there were emotional repercussions from the other characters after his death. dr venture shrugged it off when his sons blew up and nobody gave a shit when colonel gentleman and scott hall died. im not talking about it being literally impossible given the circumstances, im saying the writers wrote it that way for a reason. think for a moment and try to figure out what that reason is. it wasnt a joke and it wasnt to establish a plot point. it was to make you sad. if they went back on that, that sadness would be revoked. doc hammer and jackson publick are very talented writers and understand shit like that. that is why i dont think its possible for jonas or treister to still be alive.  so yeah if you still dont get the point im trying to make, i give up, but frankly i would be shocked and disappointing if they came back and there wasnt some grand incredible reason for them to be there like in the case of hank and dean, which i dont see happening."

He's clearly got his own agenda and I think it's kind of beyond debating guild politics and whatever shit the council of 13 does. but i do think he will be involved, just not as a council member. maybe like kind of a secret sovereign."

So, Rusty must actually be a better scientist than anyone thought."
venturebros,2tdxje,GratefullyGodless,6,Fri Jan 23 16:15:34 2015 UTC,"In the Halloween special, Ben mentions that Dean doesn't show signs of testicular torsion, because Rusty has fixed that flaw.  Also, wasn't the testicular torsion from the first season, before they died and were re-cloned into their current, final bodies?  So this Dean never had actually had the surgery, but a previous incarnation did.  A previous Hank probably had it to, and doesn't remember.  A lot of the previous clones probably had it, if it was an issue Ben was aware of and Dr Venture was working on a way to correct it.    The real question, I guess, is why Hank is circumcised and Dean is not.  Maybe they were laying groundwork for a reveal that the boys weren't Rusty's natural children?"
venturebros,2tdxje,scottmill,16,Fri Jan 23 09:14:10 2015 UTC,"I think Hank is circumcised because he gets it in the episode ""Dr. Quymn, Medicine Woman"", for saving the tribe."

We know Doc has recorded memory synapses to prime new slugs with Hank and Dean's personalities. Also, I think Hank mentions he ""jumped off the roof in my Batman costume"" to someone in a later season, but is unsure if it actually happened. All of this makes me unsure of what the current/last clones know and don't know - or even if they have a collective memory of sorts with past clones.  Either way I think it was unintentional."

venturebros,2tdxje,trashbagman,1 point,Fri Jan 23 23:33:17 2015 UTC,It's not a contradiction because the torsion problem was fixed in the newest clones. And current Hank has been through the mind eraser in at least one episode as far as I know.

venturebros,2tc4se,GratefullyGodless,1 point,Fri Jan 23 14:01:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, the call between Hatred and Rusty at the beginning of the special, Rusty mentions that he had the power turned off because they're going to be away for awhile. And Rusty is self-centered enough to forget about Hatred and his tenants when he does have the power turned off.  But, the real reason for the purpose of the storyline was they needed a way to explain burning down the compound."
venturebros,2tc4se,thomasthomas,1 point,Fri Jan 23 16:41:50 2015 UTC,"I thought the compound burned down because of the rocket launch (and the subsequent monarch-log-of-fire)? The power was back on for the fire, which is why all the fire trucks were shot by the automated lasers."

It also explained why Vatred wasn't monitoring the compound and didn't try to stop them either, as he was instead in the tunnels underneath trying to get the power back on."
venturebros,2tc4se,Science-tastic,2,Fri Jan 23 19:25:04 2015 UTC,21 came prepared for the power to be on (note his instructions on the electrified fence).

Two theories I have is that the Monarch is killing off competition for a seat on the Council or Rusty is taking the loss of JJ to heart and is going after the villains who have made his life a nightmare since birth."
venturebros,2t9vrg,a_man_called_jeyne,6,Thu Jan 22 14:29:41 2015 UTC,"The teaser from last year had someone who looks like Rusty reportedly killing villains. Maybe they're trying to frame him for the Council murders? I mean, if the sovereign and most of the Council disappeared, I think there would be some backlash over that within the guild."
venturebros,2t9vrg,B1GTOBACC0,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:00:55 2015 UTC,"They are supervillains after all. D.M.T. Monarch mentions the Guild encourages doublecrossing.

venturebros,2t9vrg,dtract,6,Fri Jan 23 12:25:36 2015 UTC,"I honestly thought they abandoned the trailer's premise for a while because the special did absolutely nothing to set it up, and in fact destroyed the status-quo that I assumed the man in blue was going to disrupt."
venturebros,2t9vrg,Nilbop,2,Thu Jan 22 15:19:16 2015 UTC,"Well no one said David Bowie killed most of the thirteen by his hand alone. Maybe this man in blue is responsible for the acid booze, dog spray, and car bomb. They haven't set it up, but they could say it was him all along."
venturebros,2t9vrg,Kid_Quasar,2,Thu Jan 22 17:53:59 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to think this too. I'm currently of the mind that the eagle killed at the end of the special was just a red herring to make us think Sovereign is dead because...well....why not? It makes sense as to why he would be killing off other Guild members too, whereas Monarch or Dr. Venture don't really have a motive for something that extreme. Why he would choose an image similar to Dr. Venture is the only thing that stumps me though it's possible that Sovereign has a deep rooted hatred toward the Venture family (remember, Colonel Lloyd Venture was the original leader of the Guild, so in a way that kind of makes Sovereign a usurper)."
venturebros,2t9vrg,aemoseley,3,Thu Jan 22 17:54:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but sometime around Season 3 when Phantom Limb was running around with his tea party Revenge Society Dean officially bestowed the title of Sovereign on David Notbowie. So David Notbowie is probably the official sovereign in that regard, and there's no reason for him to hate the Ventures since they've only really helped him out. Far as I can tell Notbowie is just a treacherous scumbag, which is why he might choose the form to throw people off the scent."

With Rusty seemingly where he should have been in life thanks to his brother, and Monarch being left off the new Guild council despite being there when it was founded, the motive seems obvious.

I'm pretty well versed in the show, but maybe I missed something.   After 24 died, and 21 went through his whole process of leaving the Monarch for S.P.H.I.N.X, and the long emptiness after all the OSI guys were ""re-avowed"", we never see Gary and Billy talking. Sure, in ""What Color is your Cleansuit"", they serve together on ""the B-Team"" to solve the Palaemon issue, but that's it.   Gary and Billy have very similar interests, the whole collecting/fanboy/trivia stuff that I imagine would make them either love or hate one another, but their relationship is kind of non-existent; at least it seems that way to me. Is there something I am missing? Perhaps a bitter eBay rivalry, like the one between Billy and St. Cloud, but as far as I can tell, it's like they don't know each other, which is just weird to me. Any insight out there to their relationship?"
venturebros,2t6rji,FamilyGuyGuy7,5,Wed Jan 21 19:48:18 2015 UTC,"I think the reason why they don't interact is because they're too far removed from each other.

venturebros,2t6rji,vlee89,3,Wed Jan 21 20:33:54 2015 UTC,"I guess that is why I wondered during the time Gary was stalking around the Venture Compound, the ""world's collided"" so to speak. There is, throughout the show, mention of a thriving Collectables Economy around the Venture World. TDermott's real mom Nikki Fictel and Billy would have certainly done some business with Gary's business, The Atomic Comic Collection Connection. All the mint in box stuff...I mean, why doesn't 21 go try and Hench for Saint Cloud? It's like Gary loves collecting, but avoids the real key players in the collecting world of the Venture Universe...  Just saying."

Gary and Billy are both voiced by Hammer, so it's unlikely a ""buddy comedy"" scene will happen between the two characters.  The ""well bullshit,"" to my statement is all the great Hank/Hatred scenes, which are Jackson talking to himself. Their voices are different enough though.

venturebros,2t6rji,teslasmash,3,Wed Jan 21 20:34:08 2015 UTC,This is true. I remember Publick and Hammer explicitly saying they keep Gary and Billy away from each other because their voices are too similar.

venturebros,2t8me0,whiskeybill,19,Thu Jan 22 01:28:44 2015 UTC,"You know, it really makes you think. In the first episode of season 2 Jonas Jr. claims that he had already gotten two doctorates within just a few months. I would imagine that no matter how intelligent one is, it would take more than a few months to earn one doctorate, much less two. Back then it just seemed like a comedic throwaway line to show his superiority towards Rusty, but with the information we know now, it makes you wonder if JJ signed a deal with The Investors between Seasons 1 and 2 which was how he was able to become so successful within such a small amount of time. Remember that Billy was given a deal by The Investors to earn his doctorate as well, so with that in mind it does seem possible."
venturebros,2t8me0,aemoseley,3,Thu Jan 22 03:09:28 2015 UTC,I hadn't even thought about that but you could be on to something there.  Jonas gets his doctorates and probably some start up cash from the investors.  I'm not entirely sure what he gave them in return though.  Maybe his life because he knew he wouldn't live to old age anyway.
venturebros,2t8me0,manicpoohbear,4,Thu Jan 22 03:29:22 2015 UTC,"From what I remember, most of the deals made with the Investors seem to end with the other person dying at their hands.  (see King Gorilla and Monstroso, plus Sovereign's reluctance at paying them back).  It looks to me that JJ probably made a deal with them early on to help him elevate himself and his family's name again, in exchange for his death (either eventual, hastened by the Investors, or maybe timed by an agreement to occur when Gargantua-2 finally opens). Couple of interesting points though:  1) What's the point of these deals in the first place?  Is there something else they gain, or do they just enjoy fucking with mortal desires?  2) Billy Quizboy got his doctorate as part of the Monstroso deal, does it come with eventual consequences?  Edit: It looks like Billy may have gotten his doctorate as part of his role in Monstroso's heart transplant.  His agreement to operate on Monstroso may have been part of the money he took to start Conjectural Technologies, but that means he got off pretty lightly..."
venturebros,2t8me0,manicpoohbear,1 point,Thu Jan 22 04:53:03 2015 UTC,Was Monstroso killed as part of his deal with the investors or was it because he started snitching on the investors to the OSI?
venturebros,2t8me0,vlee89,5,Thu Jan 22 05:21:20 2015 UTC,"I'm leaning towards snitching.  At one point, he tells Brock (I think, it's been a while since I've seen the episode) that ""he's not going to be there for much longer"", so he's willing to talk.  It could mean that he knows the Investors are coming for him now that the OSI captured him, or it could mean the obvious, that he plans to escape.    The other reason why I'm leaning towards snitching is because ""Molostro"" pretty much went down without a fight, and was relatively unprotected, even though he has tons of $$ and henchmen.  My theory is that his knew his death was coming up and he wanted to stick it to them, so he let himself get captured and spilled as much as he could before the Investors caught up with him."
venturebros,2t8me0,RuafaolGaiscioch,2,Thu Jan 22 05:48:07 2015 UTC,"I think part of the deal, and since he was going to die he decided to rat them out anyway."
venturebros,2t8me0,sputnix,2,Thu Jan 22 05:39:07 2015 UTC,Its kind of a stupid deal though if that is the case.  Monstroso is dying so he goes to the investors for help.  They offer to replace his ailing heart at the price of they get to kill him themselves?  Doesn't really make sense.
venturebros,2t8me0,scottmill,1 point,Thu Jan 22 05:54:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that doesn't add up to me.  On the other hand, Monstroso and the Investors were most closely tied in origin to eachother, and share similar color schemes.  We have no idea how long they were connected before that; perhaps the Investors elevated Monstroso in a similar manner to how they might have for J.J.  We don't even really know that J.J.'s disease was connected to the Investors, that's just conjecture at this point."
venturebros,2t8me0,takecaretakecare,12,Thu Jan 22 19:36:57 2015 UTC,It was for money to build the station. Brock explained it all before he was arrested where the companies that invested into the building of the station were shell companies for the investors and JJ was to naive to notice that they were supreme evil. The investors did this as part of their deal with sovereign to get a new space station and shake his organization up.
venturebros,2t8me0,eak125,3,Thu Jan 22 06:08:58 2015 UTC,"Brock mentioned that they traced Gargantua 2's funding back through a bunch of shell companies and discovered that the Investors had invested in the station, and Brock assumes that JJ doesn't know who he's dealign with.  But JJ recognizes them them when they walk in on his moment with Rusty, and asks for some more time, at which point they blow Brock's cover and then disable the shields.  Brock may have been mistaken in stating that JJ declined OSI protection because he was naive."

venturebros,2t8me0,SirNuke,2,Thu Jan 22 13:59:05 2015 UTC,"But if Sovereign wanted a new space station, why did he tell phantom limb to disable the ray shield in order to destroy it.  Furthermore, why did they Investors disable the ray shield when they found out it was Sovereign's plan?"
venturebros,2t8me0,SirNuke,3,Thu Jan 22 07:03:03 2015 UTC,"The sovereign didn't want a space station, he wanted to get rid of the investors"
venturebros,2t8me0,vlee89,2,Thu Jan 22 17:33:16 2015 UTC,When did sovereign say he wanted it destroyed. He told the surviving members of the council that they were going to take it for themselves and to prepare for blood. Phantom Limbs directive was called 'backdoor' as the Ray shield also kept intruders out and sovereign needed an in. Sovereign had no intention to pay the investors back and as such they not only disabled the Ray shield but also detonated the nuclear core when he shoved his hand into the console (the last part I'm assuming the reason for the core meltdown I don't remember being stated).
venturebros,2t8me0,RuafaolGaiscioch,2,Thu Jan 22 07:37:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think Phantom Limb was just supposed to turn the shield off so the Guild could get in. The Investors found out and Lips damaged the shield, either expecting the asteroid thing or causing it,  leaving the revenge society, along with everyone in Gargantua 2 to die."
venturebros,2t8me0,eak125,3,Thu Jan 22 14:20:58 2015 UTC,"Everyone on the show, no matter how powerful, has significant restrictions on what they can do.  Likewise, I imagine The Investors have some sort of limitation.  My theory is that their dealings with mortals are heavily restricted to whatever deals they make.  They could (and perhaps were planning to) kill the sovereign, presumably in exchange for power and assistance granted to him.  They don't mindlessly destroy the OSI base, even though it should be fully within their abilities.  Given how they reacted when they saw Jonas, I'm guessing that was part of the deal.  Probably offered him something like ""we'll give you resources to build Gargantua 2, and in the future, we'll get a corresponding payment.""  I wonder if the casino was Jonas' attempt to fulfill the deal, as he understood it.  Also, if this is the case, I bet Killinger operates under the same principle.  He probably takes a more subtle, manipulative approach compared to The Investors."

venturebros,2t8me0,linkkb,2,Thu Jan 22 05:57:48 2015 UTC,"I'm saying sovereign knew the investors had the ability to extract a 'payment' from him, which given how they seem to operate would likely be his life.  The Sovereign is pretty explicitly scared of them in the special.  However, they went to a great deal of effort to only kill Monstroso in OSI I Love You. Why not just sabotage the controls of the OSI hoverbase and be done with it in? There's obviously no love between them and the OSI.  My theory is because they have a deal with the sovereign, monstroso, and Jonas (and by extension Gargantua 2), but no such setup with OSI."
venturebros,2t8me0,Cpt_Hockeyhair,1 point,Thu Jan 22 06:43:44 2015 UTC,"They might not have destroyed the OSI hoverbase because they are technically part of the Guild and they have rules of engagement with the OSI.

Secondly the last thing the sovereign says in ATaG2 was ""im just some bloke who wanted to be someone else"". How Pete white is that? To me Pete has ways seemed really insecure and just like he wishes he was mrs than he is. Plus the sovereign reacted exactly like Pete would once things became to much and just nuked all his mistakes and bailed.   Lastly he went to college and everyone he knew (excluding mike who he didn't appear to like) was already some sort of heir and immediately after college they all went on to ""greater"" things.

That said, they also mentioned that if someone else did all the work they wouldn't be opposed to it.   Basically it's not on their radar or things that they particularly want/are inspired to make.

My idea for a Venture Bros game would be a Monkey Island-esque adventure starring Hank and Dean (but with some action sequence minigames).

Baron Underbheit also sounded like a different actor."
venturebros,2t31rk,n9ucs,7,Tue Jan 20 21:41:21 2015 UTC,Colbert definitely commands more money than Hader. It could have been purely a budget thing. Most of us don't really notice when a minor character's voice actor changes.
venturebros,2t31rk,hitalec,3,Tue Jan 20 22:08:45 2015 UTC,I'd argue that Stephen Colbert's voice is very effective and its absence does not go unnoticed.
venturebros,2t31rk,DudeExclamationPoint,6,Wed Jan 21 04:10:08 2015 UTC,James Adomian voiced Phage in the special.   I think he does a better Vincent Price than Hader (pretty sure who Phage's voice is based off of originally). Hader likely recorded for VB when he was still on SNL/in NY. Not sure if he moved to the West Coast after that.

If Venture Bros had to produce that many episodes I don't think they'd still be around.

It's definitely occurred to me that in terms of top-notch writing and a complex, cumulative story-arch that rewards you with multiple viewings, The Venture Bros. has more in common with ""prestige"" television shows like the ones you listed (all 3 of which I fucking love) than with other comedy or animated series. It's too bad the big accolades are a bit harder to come by for these sorts of shows, but then I guess Doc Hammer and Jackson Publick knew that going in."

I could see Hatred getting pulled back into the Guild, but he seems pretty attached to the Ventures. The Outrider. I don't know that he's exactly evil, but he'd make the perfect arch for Orpheus. Augustus St. Cloud. He's Billy Quizboy's archenemy, and it looks like Billy is getting a bigger role. Phage. No reason for him not to go back, although he's a pretty pointless character."

venturebros,2t5aex,Shoggoths,1 point,Wed Jan 21 21:11:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Fat Chance has a chance, now -- it's just that he probably isn't Council material yet. He's been trained and can prove himself as a villain now, but he just seems too new to villainy to become one of its leaders. Killinger's purpose in the special wasn't really just to help some villains, it was to put the Sovereign out of power and put the people he wanted in. He helped Fat Chance along the way, but only because FC happened to be part of the Revenge Society, unlike Limb or Underbheit who were long-time, proven villains that had fallen from grace."
venturebros,2t5aex,BeifongWingedBoar,5,Wed Jan 21 21:42:30 2015 UTC,"Baron Underbheit was there I believe. I don't think Radical Left and Fat Chance would be included. Neither would Dr. Z and Red Mantle & Dragoon; I just don't think the Guild would take them back after they gave themselves to the OSI in exchange for full pardons.   Possibilities:    Underbheit Vendata (if he's still around)- he was MIA during Gargantua 2 when the other council members were being taken out, possibly due to Brock beating the hell out of him in ""Bot Seeks Bot"" Dr. Phineas Phage- the only remaining member of the previous council of 13 besides Vendata and Dr. Mrs. The Monarch.  Torrid- was he killed by the Outrider or Orpheus or not? I can't remember. Augustus St. Cloud- ...probably unlikely. Intangible Fancy- even though he was on trial by the old council for smuggling contraband Truckules? Galacticon?"

It's also a valid reason for Killinger to deny him a seat on the council without explaination. He's at least as qualified as anyone else.  And if, as many suspect, the Monarch turns out to be related to the Ventures somehow (I'm in the 'Jonas Sr. and Monarch's mother are twin siblings' camp), that makes him an inheritor to the position by birthright."

I don't know, they're cool characters and all but I don't see them being council material. Hell, they argue enough just between the two of them!  Professor Impossible is seemingly back on the good side for now. I can see them maybe offering him a spot, but he'll decline saying that he's trying to patch things up with Sally. Plus, he was never really a member of the Guild anyways. Heck, Phage was his archenemy before he went evil.   St. Cloud is probably a no. He hasn't been with the Guild long enough to really earn a spot on the council, plus he probably wouldn't be interested since the only reason he joined the Guild in the first place was to arch Billy Quizboy. Also, even though it's not stated in the show and someone correct me if I'm wrong here, it's somewhat implied that council members no longer arch.   I think Truckules should get a spot since he seems to be an older, respected member of the Guild. Also, assuming he survived the fall, Monstroso would make a great council member (remember the logic of this series, as long as we don't see a corpse, it's unsure whether they're really dead or not). I'd love to see the unnamed plug villain get a spot just for kicks. Maybe Joseph and His Amazing Technicolor Nightmare Coat? Flying Squid? Intangible Fancy? Maybe a new villain we haven't seen yet? Not to mention there's several villains we've seen throughout the series that have gone unnamed that could get a spot."

venturebros,2t2mna,vlee89,2,Wed Jan 21 19:14:22 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it was Gary, given that Gary mentions the story again about the 8th grade field trip to Washington where he was brought into ""the Life of the Henchman"".   If you are still watching the show and it's new to you, I won't say much more, but 21 is still a main character in the show, and is described by Doc Hammer in the commentary as, ""based on me, but a far more excitable version of me.""  EDIT--I gave it some thought--I know 15 is old for an eighth grader, but Gary is kind of stupid, so he might have been held back, making it so it was him, but the early episodes are not as consistent as the newer story arcs, so  you might be right that it really wasn't him that said it, but I tend to think it was.  So, I'm pretty sure it was meant to be 21, but if they had the plans to develop 21 at that point, I couldn't say."

venturebros,2t2dnr,DepressedCartoonist,9,Tue Jan 20 22:30:09 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I read an article once that compared The Venture Bros to Mad Men and how they're both playing and examining tropes about the ""alpha-male"" and how they deal with their loss of importance / power (both perceived and real).

venturebros,2t2dnr,Shanard,8,Wed Jan 21 03:25:53 2015 UTC,"I think the creators explicitly said the show is all about failure. And because most of the cast is male, it really is about male failure. Most of the cast live in this comic book world because they would be full losers otherwise. (A charge leveled at the mostly-straight-white geeks in the real world.)  That said, the cure for failure (according to my interpretation of Killinger) is embracing your true self. His picks for the new guild are people who know what they want and go get it. Mrs. The Monarch grabs the gun and faces not-Bowie, the Revenge Gang is competent when they embrace themselves.  I do wonder about Killinger's end game and what it might mean. He wanted Rusty to embrace villainy and the truth is that he'd make a wonderful villain, except for the fact that he'd be... well, evil."

Brock is providing security at the funeral, not Hatred. Brock's head was one of the four in the S6 teaser, along with the three Ventures (huge giveaway imo). Hatred is pretty obviously fired for burning down the Venture compound (Doc confirming it was his fault; him not being in the S6 teaser).   I think either Hank quits OSI to be the Venture's bodyguard again (Doc can afford to pay him now), or the OSI deems Doc worth guarding carefully again because he inherited a bunch of important super-science stuff and is still an idiot."

It could be Brock, might be Hatred (I love Hatred, but he's definitely not quiet), but I never even considered Kano until now. He definitely meets 2/3 criteria better than Brock.

venturebros,2t31j8,Masri788,2,Wed Jan 21 07:23:22 2015 UTC,"Well in the spirit of Failure we have the stage set: Rusty is now in charge of the entire Multi-billion dollar industry of Venture Industries in New York City.  With Rusty's horrible finances and sh!tscience we can see another era of failure reawaken upon the ventures while Hank and Dean try to just stay alive but noticeably no longer boy adventurers! So this season we have no boy adventurers of anykind anymore and so I think the failure will definitely continue on a more grander scale instead of the campy idiocy of the usual boys. Like usual, Hank loves to play dressup and role play while Dean is the more emotional normal one.  Brock and Hank are still a reoccuring thing but I dont know if Hank is ever meant to succeed in being a super-spy / batman given that his character is one of a happy-go-lucky always look on the brightside man.  The weird thing here is that Dermot will have no reason to come to New York so we may not see them as often.  In fact this may signal a vapid engorged Rusty who is back on top as a rich scientist until he fouls it up again.  So yeah sadly maybe less order of the triad and possibly a down-and-out group of Hatred, order of the triad, billy, white, and dermot all being ignored by Rusty because I think that's really in Rusty's nature.  I mean, he's a guy who has seen his sons die a dozen times and has no emotion for it.  But I love that the Monarch is nearby in New Jersey! Yes we have Rusty just across the bridge in Manhattan and a henchmenless monarch (except for 21 whose basically not a henchman anymore) inhabiting his parent's mansion in New Jersey.  But again, the story didn't move anyone else to the New York area so I think we may see a bifurcated story-line or a host of free-loading characters on Rusty's inherited dime."

venturebros,2t31j8,Mekanimal,2,Fri Jan 23 05:44:56 2015 UTC,"The end of Season 5 showed the Monarch's henchmen all closing in on the Moppets. In the Gargantua-2 special, the Monarch mentions that the Moppets ""didn't live to see this"". Later, he also makes a remark that 21 is his singular henchmen.  I think the Moppets took down as many Henchmen as they possibly could before they went. Dr Mrs The Monarch didn't seem to be angry with 21, so either 21 didn't directly kill them or it was covered up so that she didn't know he did, I think.  I think this will be better explained along with a few other things in the first few episodes of Season 6.  I am forced to wonder about the state of the Guild. Killinger's involvement seems to imply it will be successful, but after that humongous purge and replacement of all it's leadership, I would think they'd be a lot weaker here-on-out. I think Dr Mrs The Monarch will be the Sovereign now, unless Killinger sticks around for some reason. (After all, he did wheel around in Force Majeure's throne.) I guess Phantom Limb (and probably most of the Revenge Society) will be in the council now, but as Sovereign, I don't know if Dr Mrs the Monarch would want to keep him around. (I wouldn't, in her situation.) It'll be interesting to see the roles reversed between Phantom Limb and the ex-Sovereign. Now our shapeshifting Bowie impersonator will be on the run from the Phantom Limb and Guild instead of vice-versa. (If he's not dead after being accidentally shot by Headshot.)  I'm kind of bummed that the Council of 13 was purged the way it was. I'm glad Dr Z & Red Mantle/Dragoon were spared, but the episode it's finally confirmed that Mommy Longlegs was councilman 11, she's killed.

He always resented his fathers legacy and what he inherited from him. He even said ""My father dumped this life on me like a scorching hot cup of responsibility"" (or something to that effect). His father mistreated him his entire life and just expected him to pick up the pieces and run with it, hence he never actually TRIED with anything.   The only times he actually tries, as in puts an actual god damn effort is when he goes and perfects a way to clone Hank and Dean. Which is no small feat no matter how you cut it.   Now I think we're going to see him put his all in this yet again. His brother left him everything he had because he trusts Rusty.

She wouldn't carry a camillus/kabar style knife assuming it's issued by some governing agency. Unless that's supposed to be Brock's knife but that wouldn't be right either. Brock's knife is a Bowie pattern with jagged spine.   Edit: I guess Brock's knife is kind of a drop point version of a bowie (i.e. classic bowie style).

He had conspired with them to both create the Gargantua-2 and also to destroy it with all of their enemies on board. As his paranoia grew, especially now that the Council of 13 was on OSI's radar, he quickly began purging them in an attempt to protect himself.  His deal with The Investors likely made him fearful of them, and justifiably so, since they appear to be magic aliens/demigods that even he couldn't control. He attempted to double-cross The Investors by having the station explode earlier than planned, with them aboard.  JJ didn't make a deal directly with The Investors. Instead, The Investors dealt with JJ through shell companies and investments. JJ, being naive and accustomed to wealthy investors, didn't bat an eye at the influx of development cash.  The Investors did that in response to their just-learned duplicity of The Sovereign. They destroyed it to show Phantom Limb that they don't care that the station will be destroyed earlier than planned -- they're too powerful to be outsmarted or betrayed.  The heist was an excuse for Killinger to gather the individuals he wanted to gather on the asteroid fortress. Everything was calculated by him so the people he wanted on his council would be there."
venturebros,2t263f,Dirk_Bogart,4,Tue Jan 20 16:23:06 2015 UTC,"JJ didn't make a deal directly with The Investors. Instead, The Investors dealt with JJ through shell companies and investments. JJ, being naive and accustomed to wealthy investors, didn't bat an eye at the influx of development cash.   He did seem to recognize them when they showed up, though, and it seemed like he understood why they were there and what they wanted. It's entirely conceivable that he made some overt deal with them, which could even be the source of his apparent perfect competence and luck, if this took place before the first episode of season two.  Or he could be completely ignorant of their nature, and merely know them as financial backers of some of his projects. Either is about as likely as the other, given the story is written in such a way that it could logically go in any number of directions without problem."
venturebros,2t263f,SirPseudonymous,3,Wed Jan 21 01:10:53 2015 UTC,So did Killinger know the Sovereign was going to be removed from power or killing off most of the council of 13?

venturebros,2t263f,GldRush98,7,Tue Jan 20 16:29:33 2015 UTC,"Being that Killinger seems to have almost omnipresent knowledge of events, especially since he seems like an associate/sibling of The Investors, I'm certain he knew exactly what was happening at the upper end of the Guild, especially since he was a member. But instead of using his considerable power to ""rule over the mortals,"" he appears to have instead usurped control of the guild using a cabal of hand-picked associates. To what end, nobody knows yet.   But it makes sense with all of his appearances from the very beginning. He's been vetting members of his ideal council all the way since Season 2."
venturebros,2t263f,Dirk_Bogart,11,Tue Jan 20 16:38:30 2015 UTC,"With respect, I don't believe Killinger ""usurped control of the Guild"", rather he did what he always has done... arranged and mentored Super-villains to be more effective.  In this case, he helped reform the Guild to be a more functional organization free from Investor influence.  He is not setting himself up to be the new Sovereign, he's structured a functional Council of Thirteen out of the best resources of the Guild and gotten them a better headquarters.

venturebros,2t263f,Oknight,2,Tue Jan 20 21:19:13 2015 UTC,"On point 1, I guess I missed where it was established that Sovereign assisted the Investors in the construction/destruction of G2? As their moniker implies, it seems to me that the Investors don't just kill people without first extracting something valuable like information, goods, or a service. Why would the Investors be interested in destroying G2 before extracting their price from JJ? I think Phantom Limb letting the cat out of the bag was the first time they learned that Sovereign was involved in the G2 affair at all. The Investors' only purpose on G2 was to get what they wanted out of JJ. But essentially I think you're right about Sovereign feeling pressure both from his own commitment to the investors and the OSI's noose tightening.  As to point 4, I think the reason they decided to go ahead with the destruction of G2 was to lull the Sovereign into a false sense of security by pretending they had died on the station. Then once back on earth they would hunt him down. They also realized somehow that Killinger was also pulling Phantom Limb's string and decided to confront him first before returning, killing two mockingbirds with one stone.  Your thoughts?"
venturebros,2t263f,OrangeTamales,34,Wed Jan 21 23:45:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, first off - we know that Killinger and the Investors are named  (hat tip /u/Skyarrow) after three of the four Greek lesser wind deities, Caecius, Skiron, and Lips, which means Killinger's real name is likely Apeliotes.   Like the Phantom Menace - there are many, many things going on, and it's been building up for even longer. Especially how the Investors operate in the Venture-Verse. This special is actually Killinger's story, like how Phantom Menace is Palapitine's.  Meantime, OSI has been getting closer and closer to the Council. Hence, the ""mysterious"" death of the ClueClown after Monstroso fingered him out as a member of the Council. That's foreshadowing of the Soverign's purge.  Gargantua 2 was doomed from the get go. JJ took their money, and the whole platform is a stage - not unlike the last scene in Hamlet. There's going to be a big explosion. Brock and Hunter know this, which is why Brock is sneaking on board on the Rich Texan's spaceship.   J.J. Jr took their money, any thing other than that deal is TBD.  Phantom Limb spilled the beans, and then the Investor wrecked the controls. Phantom is being manipulated by at least the Soverign and Killinger - and he thinks he can outsmart all of them with Game of Thrones double and triple crosses. He's not as smart as he thinks, as he's playing it exactly how Killinger needs him to play it.  Killinger needed his brothers to be isolated on the asteroid base so that he could confront and kill (or turn) them in a final battle -- which, is a VERY heavy nod to Return of the Jedi. Which was his end game.  The writing on this show is better and more complex than anything else on television."
venturebros,2t263f,blaspheminCapn,4,Tue Jan 20 16:46:04 2015 UTC,"Given the ease with which Killinger dispatched them, and his general superiority, it might reasonably be that his name is Boreas.

Could they be responsible for his meteoric rise and astounding abilities?  For his apparent half-life?  Does Rusty's ray shield have more important implications than just an energy shield for the space station?  One of his interns phased through dimensions while working on it.  That's some major ju-ju there.  Also it's made very clear that you cannot power up a ray shield on earth, perhaps the space station was just an excuse to have a platform for a giant ray shield and whatever trans-dimensional things it can do.  Killinger certainly seemed disappointed when the ray shield was re-activated, and within moments the Investors arrived for their confrontation.  Back to JJ and the Investors...we may have only seen the climax of the battle between Killinger and the Investors, without realizing that we had seen several other skirmishes.  Killinger makes a point of saving the relationship between the Monarch and Dr. Girlfriend, why?  He attempts to reunite Rusty with a psychopathic ex-lover, why?  He THEN attempts to change Rusty into a super villain to FIGHT AGAINST JJ...!  And then begins to train a new super villain organization separate from the Guild.

venturebros,2t263f,bram0,5,Tue Jan 20 22:50:38 2015 UTC,"I'll just give one rambling answer for all of them:  Everyone's characterizing the Sovereign as just another guy who got in way over his head with the Investors, but he seems like the only person who was able to get on their level.  The Sovereign was originally just some bloke who wanted to be anyone else. He made a deal with the Investors. The implication is that they had been keeping him in charge, as they both worked in each other's interest. The first sign of this is when Monstroso attempted to squeal.  Now, keeping that in mind, and the fact that the Investors and Killinger had been enemies that were struggling over the future of the Guild, we know why the Investors approached Jonas Jr., when he needed money to build a space station.  Unknown to the little guy, the space station was ultimately just meant to be the setting for trapping four magic murder men in space. Considering how spooky and reality defying they are, it seems as if this is the only vulnerable place to lure them, if any. Which is why they were interested in the first place. It was the setting for a showdown. Well, the nearby satellite was, but whatever. It was the way to get to the showdown. Whatever.  Meanwhile, Sovereign's deal isn't going south, but he's still a smart man who made a deal with the devil. That's essentially a ticking time bomb, so when he saw an escape plan, he went for it. Destroying the Guild meant nothing to him, because, if his last line was anything to go by, there was no real alliance there. If it weren't for that stray bullet, he would have succeeded in slipping beneath the cracks.  So, back to Killinger and the Investors.  They wanted each other to be in that spot. Killinger needed a reason, as well as a way to orchestrate getting that the people who formed the first group of the new Council together. So - casino robbery! The fact that it was part of a larger plan was subtly tipped off by Phantom Limb's questioning. There's no real logic for the Society to do it.  As for the Investors smashing the controls and setting off the core, that's a deep and involving question that requires some deep lore. They were just making sure."
venturebros,2t263f,wellgolly,5,Tue Jan 20 21:31:43 2015 UTC,"From what i can gather, it seems like in order to become The Sovereign, he dealt with the investors and acted like he was Bowie to rise up the ranks. Without Phantom Limb to keep things running smooth, the Guild was starting to fall apart. I think his goal was to just kill everyone who could give a shit and take the money and run.   And Killenger simply knows all."
venturebros,2t263f,funbob1,3,Tue Jan 20 16:19:55 2015 UTC,"Not just Phantom - with Hunter taking the reins of the OSI, (and purging the bad apples) they were getting deeper and deeper into the hierarchy of the Guild - as they didn't even know who the council members were until Monstroso turned. Then he fingered the ClueClown - and he died ""mysteriously."" This was foreshadowing of the purge that was about to come down.  Also note, the Council was completely against blowing up Gargantuan 2 - and that's why they rebelled - and even went straight to Hunter."
venturebros,2t263f,blaspheminCapn,4,Tue Jan 20 18:40:15 2015 UTC,"The only part I can answer confidently is the control-smashing. Yes, it shut down the shields, but Limb was only going to flip the switch, confident no one would flip it back. He didn't know Billy's mom and the Action Man were fighting back already. The Investors tried to sabotage it further, confident they could get off Gargantua-2 (which they did), and possibly give the Sovereign false hope that his plan worked.  It seems the Sovereign had made a deal with the investors, perhaps a long time ago, and perhaps they were planning to collect soon. Sovereign did not want to follow through on the deal, and figured the best way to kill the seemingly unkillable Investors would be to blow them up in space. Sure sounds like it would work.   Re:JJ's deal. Looks similar to Monstroso's deal. But the question remains, did they cut the deal with the Investors because of their fading health, or is their health fading because of the deal?"
venturebros,2t263f,MartyMcPunchman,4,Tue Jan 20 16:29:26 2015 UTC,"For that last bit, I think it was the former for Monstroso, since they procured him King Gorilla's heart. JJ might've been the other way around (He was unaware they existed, let alone that they were involved with him; he just saw it as a wealthy company investing in his company the traditional way), but honestly, it might have been entirely natural. The destruction of Gargantua-2 might've been their ""collection"" there."
venturebros,2t263f,BobSpeedwagon,2,Tue Jan 20 17:40:04 2015 UTC,"I lean towards the latter, I think their deaths were ""hastened"" after the Investors fulfill their end of the bargain."
venturebros,2t263f,manicpoohbear,2,Thu Jan 22 05:16:48 2015 UTC,"So, conspiracy brain is in high gear prepping for season 6.  The shields on Gargantua 2 were the Paleomon Project. Which caused the interns working on it to go bald and grow extra arms.  At the end of the episode he boxes them up and sends them to Jonas on Gargantua 2. Where most of the station is controlled by robots, Jonas and whatever scientists he had being the exception. Was Jonas dying, or mutating like the interns?"
venturebros,2t263f,TalkingMustache,2,Wed Jan 21 06:28:03 2015 UTC,Seems almost too obvious that JJ got cancer from working in space without shielding. But it does seem like other funny stuff happened when building that could be more devious

venturebros,2t263f,vlee89,1 point,Wed Jan 21 08:46:17 2015 UTC,"I think that the Sovereign purged the council because they wouldn't go along with the murder of everyone on the space station, being outside the treaties they signed.  He wanted Phantom Limb to kill the investors because they were somehow instrumental in making him the Sovereign (the head of the guild) and he didn't want to do whatever they demanded in return.  The investors used shell companies to finance Gargantua 2 (or a large portion of it) and wanted to either A. Make demands of him, or B. It was just a red herring to trip people up (like the Jonas Sr. cameo)  Not sure why they zapped the controls, but maybe just to make sure limb didn't do anything different than planned?  I believe the revenge society were just thinking about robbing it, but I don't know why in the beginning Limb protested if his plan was outside their knowledge anyhow.... maybe he just likes to be fickle?"

venturebros,2t0wgh,isthataturtle,11,Tue Jan 20 14:55:00 2015 UTC,"Also ""Force Majeure"" is a legal term meaning ""Act of God."" A Force Majeure provision in a contract protects the contractee from acts of god outside the contractor's control, such as war or natural disasters.

It seems out that The investors are based on greek/roman minor wind gods, with the investors being the gods of the northeast, northwest, and southwest winds.

Yeah. You know what? I'm willing to wait."

venturebros,2t1c5e,SarcasmisEasier,12,Tue Jan 20 09:44:17 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, season one was a very awkward stage for the show where it was still trying to find itself. Once Phantom Limb was introduced (near the end of season one), the show really began to grow its universe and come into itself. Season two is when the mythos of the show expanded and it's been incredible ever since. The finale of season two (""Showdown at Cremation Creek"") is when I really fell in love with it.  The show has always been good, but it went from good to great after it established its identity and began building the Venture Bros. world. It's important, though, to watch it from the very beginning (""The Terrible Secret of Turtle Bay""), as the seeds of the Ventureverse are planted pretty early."

venturebros,2t1c5e,flashmozzg,9,Tue Jan 20 15:10:26 2015 UTC,"It was a steady upward climb with every episode and crossed the threshold into good precisely at season 1 episode 7, Ghosts of the Sargasso. And it still hasn't stopped climbing. Episodes 2 through 6 are kinda fun to go back to but mostly because of investment that you won't get 'til later in the series and to see the earliest bits of character development.  The first episode was trash and remains thoroughly unenjoyable."
venturebros,2t1c5e,SvenHudson,3,Tue Jan 20 10:00:33 2015 UTC,"Yea, I agree that the first season is a lot more enjoyable once you have seen a few other seaons and get to go back and see all the little things in the backgrounds, and see how the characters evolved.  And to your hate of the first episode, do you mean the pilot (which I agree, was crap), or the actual first ep (where they go to Mexico)? I think that episode frames up the characters nicely, showing off who they really are in a quick way. Brock is brutal and unkillable. The Doc is truely selfish, the boys are nieve, and H.E.L.P.eR. loves them all unconditionally."

venturebros,2t1c5e,SvenHudson,2,Tue Jan 20 10:20:38 2015 UTC,Well on the season 1 DVD they had Dia de los as the first episode and the pilot as bonus material so who's to say.

venturebros,2t1c5e,TheCSKlepto,1 point,Tue Jan 20 11:30:35 2015 UTC,When I first watched the first episode it was so much better already than most other shows. It still has parts that I enjoy but the show really did grow by big leaps towards the end of the season. And animation has come many miles.
venturebros,2t1c5e,inkstud,6,Tue Jan 20 14:58:47 2015 UTC,The first two seasons are on Netflix. Season 1 has it's moments but for me it's the second season when it really starts to put things together. Venture Bros. is big on in jokes with an increasingly complicated plot and back story so the further back you start better. Every season is packed with more mind blowing weirdness at every turn. Are you ready for anything?...Are you still ready for anything? HUH-WROONG.  No but this show is really good and tonight's special was the culmination of several long going plots so it had extra amounts of weirdness.
venturebros,2t1c5e,James_Keith,5,Tue Jan 20 10:04:53 2015 UTC,"Well, the show doesn't really have a story over a season. There are some themes in seasons and episode arcs that link together, but nothing that would be a driving force. It does get a bit more streamlined in season two or three, where season one is more of a 'baddie of the week' kind of feel, but again, that never goes away entirely.   You either like it or you don't. There are a lot of in house gags, especially in the later seasons, and a lot of culture references, most the average person wont get. I think I'm kicking around 50% understanding and feel fortunate at that.  You have to keep in mind that this show isn't about a super scientist; it's about failure. The Doc fails at life, projects, inventions, his sons, his business, basically in all aspects. But he was a 'boy adventurer' and all the mindfucks that come with it, so it's amazing he's as well developed as he is (Johnny Quest shows up in the series and he ended up being addicted to heroin for a long time, so that shows you). The actual 'venture Bros' are nieve and children of a different era, they have no concept of the real world, and would easily die when left on their own. Within the later seasons you see some growth there, some teenage angst, but for the majority of the series the world moves around them and they are pretty much there to tell the story for the viewer.  Brock is my favorite (obviously) and the most well-rounded character. What got me into the show was watching this 'Sweedish murder machine' brutilize the Monarch's henchmen, and I stuck around at the humor. In more recent seasons he's taken a back seat in the show, leading to further development of other characters, but he is still badass in everything he does.  If you watch the series, you'll see a lot of lampooning of modern comic heroes and villians (I just started the special and already the 'Radical Left' had me laughing, obvious Two Face reference), a lot of violence, and a lot of tongue in cheek references and internal jokes.   Again, you either like it or you don't, but I love this show. My only complaint is how long it takes to come out; you complain about having 5 seasons, but the show has been on the air for 12 years! So my complaint is that there is only 5 seasons  Edit: What does it for me (extra thought) is the candid conversations between characters. You hear characters - good and bad - talking to each other like they are people, stuff that would never make it into a superhero movie or show. It's like the anti-Gilmore Girls, where when those people speak you think ""no one talks like that,"" for this show you can easily believe that these people are arguing about mundane every day subjects, like whether or not The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas is really a porn or not. I honestly laugh more at these exchanges then the actual story line, most of the time"
venturebros,2t1c5e,TheCSKlepto,2,Tue Jan 20 10:03:41 2015 UTC,"at what point did this show become this good?    Season 2+ is basically the same level of quality you see today (I think the order, from best to worst, is 3,2,5,4,1).  Season 1 was a little rough at first, but the second half is really good and even the earlier episodes have their moments.    Was it always this good and I just missed something before?   Probably, unless you only watched the very first 3 or 4 episodes.  It is a tough show to jump into the middle of though, as the continuity and in-jokiness of this show is truly out of control.   Is there a specific season/episodes where the show gets better over-arcing plot between episodes?   As I said before season 2, but really I would start with S1E1 and just deal with the first few episodes.  I think everything from S1E5 on is very worth watching.  You can skip the pilot.   5 seasons seems like a lot to catch up on, but if what I missed was as good as this special, I might just have to make some time for it.   Totally worth it."

We don't know with absolute 10,000,000% certainty that the eagle we saw get shot was the same bird that sovereign morphed into, but at this point, to my eye, it's heavily implied and I don't think it's unreasonable to list sovereign as ""Killed"" since any argument that could move his status down to ""Maybe killed?"" would move every other single dead character onto the same ""Maybe killed?"" list.  I don't disagree with you that Soveriegn's fate is still somewhat uncertain, but from what I've seen of Venture Bros these past 12 years, nothing is certain.  It's also the kind of ""piss off"" resolution they seem to enjoy. The orb was the same thing. Hyped for awhile, ultimately resolved in a deus ex busted ass machina. That seems like the way they'd kill Sovereign to me. He was never really that much of a character as much as a piece in the universe. JJ even had his funeral moved to the web. I don't expect closure for Sovereign.   ""Ruled the Guild for decades only to be shot by accident after transforming into an eagle. To this day no one knows what happened."" is EXACTLY the kind of character summary I except from Doc and Jackson."

venturebros,2t0zo1,n9ucs,1 point,Wed Jan 21 03:01:35 2015 UTC,I guess I just don't feel there was enough of a reason there. I'd wager they were running out of time and cut some councilmen talking about rebelling. They couldn't fit the epilogue as it was.
venturebros,2t0zo1,21and24,1 point,Wed Jan 21 03:04:22 2015 UTC,"I think we can assume that Red Mantle and Dragoon are coming back on, given that they were part of the Anti-Sovereign ""Old Guard,"" and we've see a lot of them compared to the rest of Old Council. Dr. Z, too, probably, and maybe Phage.  Phantom Limb (dick) and Mrs. Monarch were all but confirmed. I'll put Killinger down as a maybe, but if so, definitely the new Sovereign. It's possible he wants to be in the background, so he may step back.  The Monarch is possible but I also feel like Killinger's ""not you"" felt more like an outright exclusion than ""you're not the sovereign"" specifically. And he's really far too incompetent compared to his wife, or even 21.  I'm betting Watch and Ward will be on it, too. They were high-ranking before and led the ""resistance.""  Out of the Revenge Society:  Radical Left just doesn't seem important enough. Did he even have a line this episode?  Prof. Impossible seems likely. He's not back with Sally, she just didn't want her son's dad dead -- there's no confirmation he's non-evil. The distinction between OSI-good and GCI-evil barely exists, anyway. They just hate each other.  Underbheit, maybe? He's been in the show a long time, and he got some time one-on-one with Killinger.  Fat Chance is another possibility, and he was pretty important this episode. But he straddles the line in terms of importance.  So my guesses:   Killinger Dr. Mrs. Monarch Phantom Limb Red Mantle Dragoon Dr. Z Phage Watch Ward Fat Chance Underbheit Prof. Impossible ??? maaaybe Monarch, but still doubt it."

venturebros,2szff8,TheWiseNoob,1 point,Tue Jan 20 07:21:44 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to rank the seasons, because so much happens in them. One way is to identify weak episodes. These have some gold moments but don't contribute much to the series - the sort of episode that wouldn't make a difference if you never saw it. Let's be clear - even the worst Venture Brothers episode is pretty awesome. At the same time, some seasons have episodes that are the best in the whole series, because of how they're written, the insight into the characters (and I mean insight, not just exposition), and just how they work as a story. The following is just my (very nitpicky, very critical) personal opinions.   Season 1 has a few of them. Some of these may be unfair since the show was just starting out. Let's just say that Hammer and Publick were just learning the ropes in episodes like Dia De Los Dangerous, which has some plodding timing and unsure deliveries:    Hank: So you want to buy him ... car ... paint?  Dean: Leave the thinking to me, Albert Einsteen.   So what episodes do I think fall flat?  - Careers in Science,  - Ghosts of the Sargasso,  - Eieny Meiny Miney Magic (to a lesser extent... although Orpheus is probably my favorite character)  Best/standout episodes?  - ""Are You There, God? It's Me, Dean"" - ""Tag Sale – You're It!"" - ""The Incredible Mr. Brisby"" (this one is really unlike any other in the season, and really doesn't have to be seen, but I think it's really well written)  Season 2   Stinkers - Guess Who's Coming to State Dinner? (obviously) - Love-Bheits (feels... forced? at least to me at times)  Stars - ""¡Viva los Muertos!""  lots of great episodes in here, including ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Kills,"" ""Twenty Years to Midnight,"" and ""Victor. Echo. November.""  Season 3  I don't think there is a series-weak episode in this season. Maybe for the season,  - ""What Goes Down Must Come Up"" (because it has that terrible scene after the credits where Rusty explains everything like we're a bunch of morons)  Standout episodes - ""Dr. Quymn, Medicine Woman"" - ""The Buddy System"" - ""The Doctor Is Sin""  Season 4  IMO, this is where Publick and Hammer really figure out what they're doing and begin to retcon to their pleasure, invent backstory like crazy, and focus more on moving the story forward rather than the characters. I wish we had more of the spirit of Season 3 before we got into all the crazy OSI plots that start here.  Weak episodes - ""The Diving Bell Vs. The Butter-Glider"" (the Monarch gets distracted by a greengoblin-mobile, the best part of this episode is the Fantastic Voyage segments)  Great episodes -""Perchance to Dean"" - ""Self-Medication"" - ""Everybody Comes to Hank's""  lots of other good stuff going on though. Operation PROM is more of a marvel than a great episode because so much shit happens and yet it all makes sense. The story barely breathes though.  Season 5  I can't really process Season 5. I've watched it several times, but in some ways it's like a completely different show than any of the other seasons. So much is happening, about half of it is OSI related, and the other half is really delving into the Venture Psyche. I'd say that   episodes which could have used more polishing, maybe... - ""O.S.I. Love You."" I hope the special clears up the Investors/Monstroso story better, in a way that doesn't just frustate me.  ""Spanakopita!"" and ""Momma's Boys"" do a great job to tell us more about the Ventures.   So I guess I'd rank the seasons... best to least best  3 4 2 5/1"
venturebros,2szff8,Noumenology,2,Tue Jan 20 01:56:46 2015 UTC,"Why does everyone hate on Careers in Science? It's a very funny episode, and it establishes the darkness and sadness that can sometimes exist in the Ventureverse. People like to say that it feels cold and uninviting, but it's about space, and the difference between the golden age dream of exploration and the harsh, uninhabitable reality. It deals with the technical, logistical, and emotional issues that come with space travel and I've laughed every time I've seen it. It's one of the best episodes the show has ever done, and it's completely subtle about it.  4 > 5 > 3 > 2 > 1"

When I explain it, it's too complicated and seems more likely that it was just a riff on the fact that people usually aren't physically on the other side of that glass, but in the moment it hit me pretty hard, I almost fell off my couch.

venturebros,2svhhy,amedeus,26,Tue Jan 20 07:10:48 2015 UTC,It looks like they are completely dumping the idea of controlled arching in the realm of absurdity.  There is real consequences and villainy now in this new season.  I think this marks a change for the world of super villains and heroes in Venture Bros. Let's see how the new councilmen work things out.
venturebros,2svhhy,travio,48,Tue Jan 20 06:14:46 2015 UTC,"I actually think it's the opposite - Killinger is a huge supporter the old guard of arching  (look how passionate he was about training people, and in the previous episode where he tried to turn Rusty).  Killinger seems to want to create mischief but in the classical, comical arch nemisis/hero way. The Investors took things too far and wanted to destroy everything in the name of chaos/power/absurd goal. And everything Killinger fights for has a layer of out-of-place nostalgia to it, nostalgia for a Jonas Sr. era's style of villainy.  And specific to this episode, they've set up so much that just screams ""cheesey adventure cartoon tropes"" that may herald a return to controlled arching: evil asteroid space station is new Guild base, Rusty and pals go explore the craziness that is New York City and its likely many super-powered residents, space hulk."
venturebros,2svhhy,RuafaolGaiscioch,26,Tue Jan 20 10:26:46 2015 UTC,That last Team Venture from JJ to Rusty ripped my fucking soul out. Phenomenal special.
venturebros,2svhhy,InvaderDJ,47,Tue Jan 20 07:31:42 2015 UTC,"Holy fucking shit.  What an episode.  This felt like a season, all in 50 minutes.  Publick and Hammer are incredible.  Adult Swim needs to chain them in a workshop and throw whatever money, drugs, and pop culture they need to make Venture Bros on a more regular schedule.  I'm so pumped for Season 6 now.  I'm not sure if this is supposed to be like the Halloween episode and take place over a long stretch of time throughout the season.  If so, I'm kind of disappointed because it seems like the new Guild, Gargantua 2 blowing up, revealing Killenger as one of the Investors spoils all the high points of the season.  But if this doesn't take place over the span of the season I can't wait to see what they do with season 6.  Just about everything we knew has been thrown on its head.  New Guild, Killinger basically the main bad guy, the Sovereign is dead, Rusty now has a crapton of money, so much potential for new plot lines.  Speaking of Rusty having a bunch of money the one disappointment I can think of with this special is that JJ never saw Rusty for what he really was and we never got confirmation whether his humble bragging was JJ being a dick or if he was really that oblivous to how much of a failure Rusty was.  I would have loved for JJ to reveal himself as a spiteful dick who knows that it is killing Rusty for a tumor to be better than him in every way.  Now it is time to rewatch all of Venture Bros again.  We do get season 6 this year right?"
venturebros,2svhhy,vlee89,29,Tue Jan 20 14:21:35 2015 UTC,"J.J. Jr. knew exactly what a wash-up Rusty was. Very early on this was confirmed when he and Hadji were on a conference call and Hadji made a joke about Rusty asking for more cash. The shield was JJ's way of throwing a bone at his ""big brother,"" and (more importantly) for him to prove himself -- to which, by absolute hilarity and by almost zero actual work by Rusty himself, he delivered at the last possible second.  Rusty finally had a change of heart, again, like the consummate procrastinator that he is - in realizing that his brother was about to die and what that loss really meant. Rusty's fainting at the end of the epilogue tells me that Rusty had zero idea or even a glimmer of a hope of even touching the legacy that his malformed half clone tumor-brother was leaving behind. The fact that the new Venture Empire was left to him was a shocker.  Now what he does with it... we can only use history as a guide. And that's going to be all of season 6. Rusty way in over his head and pretending to be Tim Cook."

venturebros,2svhhy,ThaBenMan,7,Tue Jan 20 09:11:18 2015 UTC,"Is Phantom Limb actually showing some personal growth? He wanted to know what would happen to the other members of the revenge society and he felt like a failure for betraying them, which seems like the most ""giving a shit about other people"" we've ever seen from him, Dr. Girlfriend aside."
venturebros,2sxn31,panicattackk,5,Mon Jan 19 13:49:56 2015 UTC,"Why is Dean the sovereign?  I would suggest that although Hank is older than Dean by an impressive 4 minutes, we don't actually know Hank is older, since we don't know much about the actual cloning process. Perhaps Hank was older, in the sense that he was a prototype, or ""first try"", and Dean was the intended heir-apparent to the Venture Family name.   Which takes us to the second question about Hank having this life ""thrown at him"". Dr. Venture wasn't talking about adventure and gung-ho military type stuff, but rather the whole ""super-science"" racket. It is very clear that Rusty sees Dean as his son, and Hank as his son's twin brother. I will admit, Hank drinks the Kool-aid much more deeply than Rusty gives him credit for, but remember that Rusty is very self-absorbed, so it doesn't matter how hard Hank tries to impress his father. He just never will. Dean is the better son. Period.  As for Hunter and Monstroso thing, don't forget, Hunter was testing Molotov the whole time. Having a copy of Monstroso, or a few around at all times, could seriously help aid Molotov's cover and the whole operation itself.   Full disclosure, I am just a fan with a username; I have to wait like the rest of us to find out what happens, and I have no insight to the show other than watching it over again dozens and dozens of times. These are all just guesses, so feel free to discredit me for any blunders."
venturebros,2sxn31,thecatdemon,1 point,Mon Jan 19 14:25:29 2015 UTC,"I can't really answer your first question, but I'll try for the 2nd and 3rd. Obviously, like your post, this will have spoilers.  In ""Every Which Way But Zeus"", I think his point was more-or-less that Hank is tough enough to handle all the crazy stuff that happens to him while Dean has a harder time coping. Examples of how this is the case are abound in the series.    Dean suppresses memories of the two's first encounter with Sgt. Hatred while Hank remembers well and remarks that ""most of it was awful"". Dean has insisted before that Brock just knocks people out, Hank then points out that they took all those people away in bodybags, to which Dean insists they were ""sleeping bags"". Dean informs Hank that he found out the two of them were clones, which has seriously upset and depressed Dean, and Hank remarks that he thinks that's awesome and that's it's good to be a Venture.   Another good example of Dean ""Believing this crap"" would be when the Monarch tried to give G.U.A.R.D.O. Chlamydia and was caught by Dean. The Monarch tells Dean that if he tattles on him that his evil metamorphosis will be complete and he will become as evil as the Monarch. Dean insists he will never be as evil as the Monarch and runs off without telling Doc about the situation.  I like how Dean's developing though. He's a lot more level-headed and skeptical nowadays.  As for your question about Operation P.R.O.M., I believe that Brock said earlier that none of them knew which one was the real Monstroso. (I may have remembered that line incorrectly, it's been a little bit since I've rewatched that episode.) Either way, we find out that Skypilot was Treister's man-on-the-inside, which means that even if Hunter did originally know which one was the real Monstroso, Skypilot would have manually switched him out for the decoy anyway as part of Treister's long plot to eliminate Cardholder and Doe. As for why Hunter originally decided to have the real Monstroso so close, I don't know.  I hope this helped/answered your questions. I apologize if it didn't."
venturebros,2sxn31,drramc,1 point,Tue Jan 20 00:56:19 2015 UTC,"Your first Question: I'm pretty sure both venture boys are entitled to the position it's just that ""David Bowie"" found Dean first. He probably would have said the same thing if he found Hank first.   Second Question: Doc's speech is about how much he sees so much of himself in Hank since he too see's the silliness of being arched by members of the guild. That when dealing with the guild and playing by there rules your basically putting on a show. Hank sees past the smokes and mirrors of the guild and just rolls with it. While Dean, the most naive of the two, always thinks he's endanger and thinks he's going to die not realizing he's in a controlled environment where no harm will come to him.  Third Question: Hunter discovered that there were spies in the OSI so he didn't know if it was safe to bring the real body up there so he held on to Monstroso as collateral. He needed to look surprised just in case the spies were nearby. If he acted calm then that would have added suspicion that Hunter was hiding something. And how could the back and forth be a ruse to trick Cardholder and Doe if they weren't even in the sphinx aircraft?"
venturebros,2sxn31,Lethargyc,0,Tue Jan 20 04:29:31 2015 UTC,"The entire Hunter storyline from The Family That Slays Togetherm, Stays Together through to Operation PROM makes no sense.  Just to add to your problem; Hunter takes a copy of Monstroso to the OSI, unaware that   the entirety of his team, which a grunt tells us is all of SPHINX bar Brock, Shore Leave and the rookie, are OSI double-agents that there were a bunch of agents hiding in the Monstroso copy or being more generous that people could hide inside the body and that as revealed in the season 5 opener, neither copy was Monstroso at all.   That's neverminding Molotov's constant mess of ""she was working for blank all along"" which is played straight like 3 times."
venturebros,2sxn31,nihilance,-4,Mon Jan 19 19:22:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think Hank is 100% venture dna.  In fact, I don't think Hank or Dean are what anybody thinks they are."

venturebros,2svpj5,hitalec,3,Mon Jan 19 01:52:29 2015 UTC,I had hoped the opposite but I suspect you're right. So we can really suspect a special and then probably 8 1/2 hour episodes. Sigh... Venture Bros how I love thee and how you taunt me.

venturebros,2sumet,jondaniels16,5,Sun Jan 18 21:43:31 2015 UTC,It's been a while since I watched the show. Can someone catch me up on the plot line going into this special?
venturebros,2sumet,tactics14,8,Sun Jan 18 19:30:17 2015 UTC,"Dr. Jonas Jr. (Rusty's fraternal twin brother) has spent a couple years rebuilding the space station Gargantua, which Rusty accidentally destroyed over the course of decades.  The original station was built by Rusty's deceased father.  Gargantua was largely unused, with only a two person crew manning the station.  Jonas Jr. became a rich pioneer in the tech industry.   He basically owns the iphone/ipad property of the Venture Universe, and has expanded into a huge portion of the economy with other properties.   Gargantua-2 is much bigger and seems to be a tourist attraction rather than a super scientist lair that the original was.  The Guild just lost two members of it's ruling council to insanity and death.  Seemingly replaced by Dr. Mrs. The Monarch and The Phage.  The Revenge Society (Phantom Limb, Dr. Impossible, Baron Underbite) tried to take over the Guild by using the ORB, but were thwarted by the Sovereign.   Since then they are regrouping with Dr. Killinger somehow.   They're spending time spying on the Guild's council room.  So they might have their sights on them.  Sphinx is gone.. again.   General Gathers runs OSI after Treisler 'retired'.   Brock, Shore Leave and co. are all OSI again.  Monstroso is presumed dead (but it was an offscreen death).   The Investors were last seen 'killing him' and infiltrating OSI to find out what happened to Moltov.     Moltov works for OSI now (on paid retainer).  Mostly to stop counter intelligence.  Dean and Hank know they're clones, and are now okay with it.  It took Dean over a year and Hank about 2 seconds."
venturebros,2sumet,jondaniels16,4,Sun Jan 18 19:42:58 2015 UTC,"Gathers runs OSI after Treisler 'retired'. Brock, Shore Leave and co. are all OSI again.   I wish they hadn't showed Treisler in the trailer. Would have been a nice surprise."
venturebros,2sumet,jondaniels16,5,Sun Jan 18 21:45:13 2015 UTC,agreed.   It just might be an after credits gag though.  He might not be involved at all.
venturebros,2sumet,JoelLikesPigs,3,Sun Jan 18 21:51:44 2015 UTC,"Eyyyyyy! I'm just gonna believe that and it'll be exciting again. It could also be a dream sequence, maybe a hallucination as Hunter Gathers struggles with his new found responsibility."

venturebros,2sumet,aldenkai,3,Mon Jan 19 06:26:23 2015 UTC,"If it's the same one that I'm thinking of, from this clip, then what they did during the trailer was show the part at 0:35 on without revealing that it was just Bowie messing with them. So yeah, I can see them turning the Treister reveal during the show into a big gag even with them having already told us he's back."

It also looks like the guild HQ Comes under attack, as you can see multiple scenes of Dr. Girlfriend fighting there. The venture compound is shown on fire, with what looks like serious damage as well. Oh and that kind of looks like Billy's mom sitting next to doc on gargantua II."

venturebros,2swg9l,ravens52,3,Tue Jan 20 06:19:44 2015 UTC,For seasons 3 and 5 they released shirts for each episode that were either pre purchase for all shirts or purchaseable each week after the episodes aired. The individual shirts were available only till the next episode aired. If you pre ordered you would get an extra shirt only available through pre orders.   The season 5 t shirts also came with hank bucks that were later able to be redeemed or kept. When they released a giant hank buck beach towel.   This premier it looks like there are 3 offerings for 14 days called the winter collection. 2 beanie hats and a hoodie.   I don't think they will do anymore this season but they look great. Especially the astrobase one!
venturebros,2swg9l,GldRush98,0,Tue Jan 20 06:30:44 2015 UTC,I don't think so Tim.   At least there is no mention of it on the Titmouse site where all the previous shirt clubs came from: http://www.titmousestuff.com/collections/t-shirts-1
venturebros,2suupx,Golossos,28,Sun Jan 18 19:39:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly jumping from Season 2 to Season 5 is a bit of a gamble. Dean especially goes through a BIG change in personality in Season 5, and that starts right at the end of the Season 4 finale. Plus you will completely miss introductions to a lot of new characters, like Sgt. Hatred for instance. He appears in the finale of season 2, but past that he is voiced by a new person and he plays a much MUCH bigger role in the show.  I would just watch Seasons 3 and 4, which are some of the best seasons in an already great show. You will be very happy to get more context of the characters and their relationships. I mean, you'll have no idea why Brock is no longer with the family, and you wont even realize that him and all his OSI buddies were just a season ago covert operatives working out of a completely different organization.  Basically, watch the show in chronological order. Will you enjoy Season 5 if you just jump in blind? Probably, because the show is fantastic. But having the context of those previous two seasons will let you understand so much more of the story/characters/jokes."
venturebros,2suupx,TitusVandronicus,7,Sun Jan 18 20:17:16 2015 UTC,"Besides, the season four final episode is probably the greatest finale ever made for television"

venturebros,2suupx,tobiathan,5,Sun Jan 18 22:39:26 2015 UTC,"The show is unlike most cartoons in that it has a linear storyline. It is best to watch it in order, at least until you've seen all the episodes."
venturebros,2suupx,Iamthesmartest,5,Mon Jan 19 18:28:51 2015 UTC,"It is absolutely essential to watch the show in order the first time through. There are so many callbacks and the characters change so much (both in their personality and their situations) that things will make no season if you jump around, ESPECIALLY going from season 2 to 5. I'd say that the first 3 seasons constitute one ""era"" of the show, and after the season 3 finale and season 4 premiere, a lot of huge things change in a BIG way."

venturebros,2s6cqf,nihilance,2,Tue Jan 13 22:52:27 2015 UTC,Earlier in the episode 24 interacts with a former Monarch henchman who joined up with Monstroso. I think that scene exists to leave the door open to 24 left before Orpheus was paying attention if they change their minds later.
venturebros,2s6cqf,insllvn,2,Mon Jan 12 17:30:33 2015 UTC,"No. The entire back and forth about Mr Wilson further proved it was all in 21's head, since the old black man he was seeing with 24 was not only named something else (Baba O was it? ) but was also still alive. As soon as 21 realizes 24 (and friends) were just in his head they immediately vanish and he breaks down sobbing, finale able to accept the death of his friend.   Edit: Windel not Wilson. Plus Morpheus steps through the hallucination face first while taking 21 down."

Orpheus steps face first through the 24 hallucination... there is no way he wouldn't have seen 24's ghost if it was really there. It is not a case like you say of 24 disappearing before Orpheus was paying attention.

P.B. and Rusty, with both of their love in science and pettiness, would catch on like a house on fire.  And Brock.... well, he and Billy (not Quizboy, but the legendary hero in A.T.) would get along, maybe."
venturebros,2s2ln3,Flooping_Pigs,3,Mon Jan 12 07:50:34 2015 UTC,"Rusty would be incredibly creepy and try to fuck PB as soon as he learned she was 18.   Maybe even before that since he already knocked up a 16 year old.   He would definitely trick Finn into handing over all their treasure.   Probably steal some candy people to see if he could turn other things, like C4, into intelligent, walking weapons for the military.   Rusty Venture is not a Good Person."

venturebros,2s5i4u,Potvaliant,1 point,Tue Jan 13 00:16:25 2015 UTC,"My interpretation of his story is as follows: Hatred is a great soldier and gets recruited to the OSI. He is then given super soldier serum which makes him have rage and become a pedo. His rage becomes directed towards the OSI so he tries to bring it down internally having secretly joined GCI. He eventually retires from OSI and joins GCI full time. The OSI did pursue him but as they said in the first episode of season 4, he has a head full of OSI secrets and has a better function than just dying."

Don't get me wrong, I love that we got more episodes, but I think many fans agree that we would have been satisfied if that was how the show ended.

In some interview/panel/commentary around the time season four was out, I believe they originally stated that they didn't want to go past season six, and that they were planning five and six simultaneously. In season five commentary, as memory serves, they sort of got a second wind and stated that they'd gladly keep going indefinitely so long as they keep getting renewed.  No seasons past six have been ordered by Adult Swim for production, but if season six gets good ratings (as have all other seasons thusfar), there's a good chance that Doc & Jackson will be optioned for more."

venturebros,2qqm6g,swordmasterofict,13,Mon Dec 29 19:49:29 2014 UTC,I'd start by thinking of what aspects of the show you think would make good gameplay. Personally I think the whole Arching concept that's so central to the show would be a good place to start. Another possibility would be something centered on The Compound. Maybe an exploration style game where you make your way through the sub-complex.
venturebros,2qqm6g,abbierevo,5,Mon Dec 29 21:04:22 2014 UTC,"There's something solid in that idea. You could be a potential arch at the guild and pick cards for your powers, costume etc. with various bonuses and drawbacks. You then pick cards for your lair and henchmen. Your opponent is a superscientist and picks his cards, compound, bodyguard, etc...  Then you have it out in some magic card kinda way or pokemon? The idea is for a board game so I'm not sure how that fits in."
venturebros,2qqm6g,jondaniels16,5,Tue Dec 30 00:41:49 2014 UTC,"Well first off, a board game could be just a tabletop game.   The game space doesn't have to be a set board.   I feel like an RPG approach would work best.   Characters are key on VB."
venturebros,2qqm6g,abbierevo,2,Tue Dec 30 02:35:09 2014 UTC,"I like that. Have 8-12 faction cards, players draw 1 at the beginning - each have different attack/resistance and unique power. Let's say I drew the Conjectural Technologies Faction and my alignment is neutral - I can ally with evil or good alignments but I have a lower than average attack/res making me weaker working solo. I could even get a bonus if I make an alliance with Team Venture or the Investors. Then all you gotta do is make a deck of (bad)Venture Cards to draw from composed of chance-style cards, minons, powerups, tech/costume, etc and we got card game - 4 to 12 players, ages 18 and up. I might just do this..."

venturebros,2qqm6g,mfdoll,7,Mon Dec 29 21:58:45 2014 UTC,"I'm thinking ""Chutes & Ladders"" with ""Chance"" cards:   You've been cloned! The cloned character goes twice, but if they land on a space already occupied by their clone, both clones die of shock and a new player starts at the beginning.  Time travel! Advance 10 spaces and on your next turn roll as normal but go back that many spaces. Play returns to normal the following round.  Quiz Boy! You are now the Quiz Master. Ask a random player a Venture Trivia question. After they answer they roll to see how many spaces forward or back they go.  Secret Sibling! A sibling you didn't know about enters your life and takes half your stuff. They're better at everything than you are, too.  Mind Wipe! Go back 5 spaces.  Master's Apprentice! The Master helps you gain clarity. Advance 3 spaces.  Crazy Ex! Your crazy ex shows up and blows up your car! Lose a turn.  Rusty's Law! The player to your right loses one turn.  Go Team Venture! An original member of Team Venture comes to your aid. Go back 2 spaces.  IGNORE ME! The first player to make eye contact with you goes back 3 spaces.    And if you land on a space with another player (your arch rival), you each roll the dice. Highest player advances that many spaces and loser goes back as many spaces as they rolled."

Jet Boy and Jet Girl you know.   24 would probably have ended up as more of a civilian scarred by his involvement with arch villainy.

Sure, they were pathetic and had sad, empty lives, but they had them together. I think 24 would have gone through a similar deal as 21 did, finding out who he was without his best friend.   I doubt he would have been as much fun as Gary - he was more of a foil and didn't really initiate anything that I can remember - led a much more reactive life. Then again, I could see him becoming a downward-spiralling alcoholic, who uses his natural disenchantment and pessimism to become the main foil for the Monarch, perhaps. I could see him drunk, yelling about how this or that crazy plan wouldn't work, crying into his whiskey about 21, maybe even snapping and plotting the downfall of the moppets. Maybe 21's death would have been this amazing galvanizing event that turned him down the path of super-villiany. Anyway that's what I would have done, if i wrote it. Had him foil for the Monarch awhile, quitting in disgust, killing the moppets and then maybe taking on Phantom Limb as a villian's villian."

venturebros,2qefzr,McGravin,1 point,Fri Dec 26 15:55:42 2014 UTC,I remember a pic of St. Cloud in Now Museum Now You Don't. It was after the Jonas Sr. tribute video. But it's a pretty shitty version of him. He's better defined later on.
venturebros,2qefzr,2pacalypsenow,7,Sat Dec 27 10:19:02 2014 UTC,They say in the DVD commentary to never look at background characters.
venturebros,2qefzr,fifelement,2,Fri Dec 26 09:54:19 2014 UTC,"They also said in one of the commentaries that they would judge who would be their animators by the person drawing a random background character, and then using that character. The only problem was that they eventually just kept ending up hiring the same animators and couldn't get any more new background people."

venturebros,2qefzr,KamFox,3,Fri Dec 26 01:05:25 2014 UTC,"It's sloppy animation on the part of the production companies they've used, they've gotten more budget and better animators as the series has progressed.

venturebros,2qd2qt,Trexdacy,5,Thu Dec 25 17:32:59 2014 UTC,"It could be JJ or Monarch in that womb scene. It's actually a clever out for Publick-Hammer. Depending on how it all turns out, you could keep the assumption that it's JJ being strangled or have it explained that it was in fact Monarch in the womb with Rusty and that JJ was a triplet absorbed by Rusty."
venturebros,2qd2qt,thecatdemon,3,Fri Dec 26 03:03:12 2014 UTC,"I think that was more of a hallucination, and it might turn out he isn't the original, but a messed up clone, and that was part of a snafu in the process."

venturebros,2qd2qt,TitusVandronicus,1 point,Fri Dec 26 06:06:47 2014 UTC,"Easy to explain with more weirdness! Either A. Rusty is a clone of the original Rusty that had a slight defect. B. Jonas thought Rusty could stand to be more like his old man, and injected him with some weird concoction of his DNA accounting for why JJ is so small, and why he's so much like Jonas Sr.  C. a combination of the two."
venturebros,2qd2qt,thecatdemon,2,Fri Dec 26 22:33:40 2014 UTC,"I'm forced to wonder if they originally planned the hallucinations for an early-on reveal that Doc and The Monarch were twins. (But instead opted in favor of the Jonas Jr idea.)  Probably not, but that would be cool. It would explain the in-utero strangling and stuff; They were born to be enemies!"
venturebros,2qd2qt,Robotdavidbowie,3,Fri Dec 26 11:21:05 2014 UTC,I feel like it would be way too obvious. the photo is probably misdirection.

venturebros,2qd2qt,thecatdemon,1 point,Thu Dec 25 16:38:13 2014 UTC,"True, but they're also consistently compared to each other by people who know them both. It's possible that was more of a joke about their similar personalities."

venturebros,2qd2qt,satisfried,2,Thu Dec 25 23:36:07 2014 UTC,Goldmember came out a year before venture Bros I'm almost positive
venturebros,2qd2qt,20000Deths,1 point,Mon Dec 29 01:02:17 2014 UTC,"Of course, but I'd expect them to take another direction if there were plot overlap between Venture Bros and Austin Powers."
venturebros,2qd2qt,brinard,2,Fri Dec 26 00:25:39 2014 UTC,I think it's worth remembering that both franchises are parodies of the same kind of films/media though. The sense of humour of the Venture Bros is enough of a driving force that they deliberately introduce characters with silly or contrived stories as a parody of the comic books and cartoons that do that unintentionally.
venturebros,2qd2qt,OmegaChevalier,1 point,Fri Dec 26 11:28:57 2014 UTC,"The theme of twins is kind of inconsistent to.  Rusty's twin is JJ. But then there's Dermot who doesn't have a twin that we know of. Is the tendency for twins on the male or female side?    I think they are dropping massive hints that Rusty and Monarch are related, and they have been for a long time. But it's just too clean and obvious. I'd bet they take things to a very unexpected place."
venturebros,2qd2qt,gregenheim,1 point,Thu Dec 25 18:51:49 2014 UTC,"Again, sometimes when you expect the unexpected a little too much, the best thing to do it hit you with the obvious."
venturebros,2qd2qt,badluckartist,1 point,Fri Dec 26 03:14:16 2014 UTC,"It sort of sounds about right, except that T.R. is already a venture twin with his Jonas Jr. so then monarch rusty and J. Jr. would be Venture triplets, still brothers tho.  Also the Monarch and Dr. V as bros theory went all the way back to the first season I think when it was really obvious that they looked similar and then Jonas Jr. got thrown in to disrupt it.   I figure the absence of Rusty's mother is just paralleling the absence of Hank and Dean's mother."

venturebros,2p4qva,kamy2425,34,Sat Dec 13 00:51:44 2014 UTC,"As much as we complain about the wait times between seasons, Venture Bros is absolutely the one and only show that I will willingly wait 2-3 years between seasons without giving up. It is precisely because of this wait that the show is so good because they actually have time to write and produce the scripts they want, rather than sticking to a strict timeline. Plus I kind of like the idea that the show will still be putting out new episodes for the next ten years (even if it is only, like, two more seasons)."
venturebros,2p4qva,GrandGalactcInquistr,4,Sat Dec 13 03:54:40 2014 UTC,"I can't remember where I heard it, but I'm pretty sure Publick said that the new season will be the penultimate one"

venturebros,2p4qva,hitalec,2,Sat Dec 13 23:31:52 2014 UTC,The last time adult swim picked them up it was for seasons 6 & 7 and I always assumed that would be the end. As long as it goes out when it's still good. I would be so disappointed if the show went out on a mediocre season just because they wanted to do more. I don't think they would actually let that happen though :)
venturebros,2p4qva,GrandGalactcInquistr,2,Sat Dec 13 04:24:37 2014 UTC,My understanding was that they were picked up for seasons 5&6 (explaining why there has been a relatively short time between the two seasons).  Haven't heard anything about 7.

venturebros,2p4qva,FKRMunkiBoi,6,Sat Dec 13 03:57:05 2014 UTC,But if they hired more help the show wouldn't be as concentrated. I think it's so great because it's basically two guys doing a bunch of the work and they both have very specific ideas of what the show should be and have incredibly high standards. Adding more help might dilute that.

venturebros,2p57qp,GrandGalactcInquistr,10,Sat Dec 13 03:58:32 2014 UTC,"Its pretty much just the two of them writing it, so after they write it they have to voice record it (as they do a lot of the voices and to temp voices to fill in for people) and at least get the animation underway (storyboarding, etc), which in itself takes time.   I remember somewhere reading that an episode of the Simpsons takes about 6 months to go from starting on the script to delivering it to the fox. So imagine how many people the Simpsons had working on that episode, and then think of how many less people Venture Brothers has behind it and thats why it takes a lot of time."

venturebros,2p57qp,wishinghand,2,Mon Dec 15 23:12:21 2014 UTC,"True, but I wonder if the profits from the Venture Bros can sustain them. One of the reasons a lot of Cartoon Network cartoons aren't every year (besides VB) is that they don't have enough money to fund annual seasons. Adventure Time gets two seasons per year because that is very popular over a wider demographic."

venturebros,2p1itz,NovaStarLord,11,Fri Dec 12 05:53:58 2014 UTC,Considering that its a high production value labor of love made by two guys and their pals it sort of makes sense that they take such a long time to produce each season.

venturebros,2p1itz,MellowS13,8,Fri Dec 12 08:00:49 2014 UTC,The last couples seasons have been stepping up everyone's personalities so perfectly its just better than anything else. There are no forgettable characters in Venture Bros.  The difference between Hank and Dean now is so bittersweet.
venturebros,2p1itz,20000Deths,3,Fri Dec 12 08:10:41 2014 UTC,You can see how different they are becoming baby how each of them reacted to finding out they're clones

venturebros,2p1itz,20000Deths,3,Fri Dec 12 16:19:19 2014 UTC,"The move to actually give the cast fuller characters is great as long as there is legitimate movement and a payoff, not just an endless delay of the status quo.

(Is it obvious I'm super dissapointed about Gary in season 5?)"

One episode where he gets clowned by Sphinx and chewed out by Shore Leave and the finale where he's just been camping out in the Venture Compound for however long."
venturebros,2p1itz,Lethargyc,3,Fri Dec 12 20:54:42 2014 UTC,I know! They missed and opportunity to make Gary the badass he was meant to be. I'd like to see him go out on his own and thrive.
venturebros,2p1itz,MellowS13,1 point,Fri Dec 12 19:40:19 2014 UTC,"Yep they went through a lot of character development these last two seasons and they went from Johnny Quest classic boy adventurer and boy detective pastiches and gained more unique personality traits.  Hank despite everything still retains a lot of his optimism, Dean completely changed after Season 4 especially after he learned he was a clone he just lost a lot of his innocence."

Otherwise, s5 was their weakest. Personally, a weak Archer episode is still better than most shows ""good"" episodes (i.e. most sitcoms), so the bar may be lower but it's still worth my time.   I'm going to revisit s5 when it comes out on Blu Ray and see if my opinion changes."

venturebros,2p1itz,watcher45,1 point,Fri Dec 12 06:53:50 2014 UTC,Yeah it was kinda screwy. They got a contract for 2 more seasons and a movie is what I read after season 4. But I don't believe there was any restrictions on number of episodes per season. Listening to the commentary for season 4 it sounds like they almost considered volume 2 of season 4 to be season 5 but ended up rolling it in. So season 5 could've been longer but they cut it short. I guess the season lengths have more to do with their funding than anything. Spending all their money on the rights to like one famous song haha
venturebros,2p1itz,marceline407,2,Fri Dec 12 07:16:18 2014 UTC,"Both season 5 and 6 were commissioned for ten half-hours. Episode 1 was an hour and the halloween episode was included in that. Season 6 will be exactly the same length, unless the special they announced isn't included in that."
venturebros,2p1itz,waltorr,1 point,Fri Dec 12 08:28:05 2014 UTC,So their contract shortened the seasons more than their past seasons? Interesting. Cause season 4 was long

venturebros,2p1itz,Zerovarner,1 point,Fri Dec 12 09:16:03 2014 UTC,"Yea, Doc Hammer and Jackson Publick have both noted that the sixteen episode season strained them too much. That's the main reason that they have chosen to do eight episodes each season since."
venturebros,2p1itz,Soverance,2,Fri Dec 12 14:22:29 2014 UTC,Makes sense. Honestly I thought the quality of season 5 was spectacular so it didn't bother me much that it was shorter
venturebros,2p1itz,blaspheminCapn,3,Fri Dec 12 10:06:20 2014 UTC,It didn't bother me until the last episode of the season when I found out it was the season finale. :(

That said, so much of the appeal of the show is in the thematic and emotional content that I feel like I'd have to pick out at least one later episode that emphasizes that.  Maybe ORB, from season 3, or Self-Medication, from season 4.  Both have a degree of gravitas to them that I think effectively communicates some of the deeper value of the show beyond its humor.  Other fantastic introductory episodes that are reasonably stand-alone, beyond the ones mentioned here (completely agree that Ghosts of the Sargasso and Tag Sale, You're It! are perfect) are, imo:   Everybody Comes to Hank's - one of my favorite episodes from the series, overall.  The absurd contrast between Hank's goofy ineptitude and hard-boiled confidence is great, and the fact that everyone else in the show seems to be aware of and/or playing along with the absurdity (e.g. Al, Billy) is great.  The Buddy System - highlights the numerous failures in Doc's life, both moral and financial, and his development from child star to burned out 40-something; introduces Dermot in, imo, one of his best episodes; and illustrates some of the Hanna Barbera influences with Action Johnny.  Also: Walter Melon.  Handsome Ransom - touches on a lot of the elements that satirize superheroes.  All the ridiculous jokes about the inherent concern about pedophilia in a lot of the billionaire-and-his-ward duos, plus a lot of generally good scenes (e.g. Ghost Robot waxes philosophical about existential anxieties).  Venture Libre - man, maybe my favorite non-serious episode of the show.  Just the premise always struck me as brilliant: ideologically Marxist revolt led by a bunch of experiments from a jungle saturated with reclusive evil mad scientist archetypes looking for places to build their secret labs.  I always saw all that stuff and wondered where all these evil labs kept popping up and if all the mad scientists ever bumped into each other while violating the laws of nature and the rules of man, and this plays on that idea wonderfully.  It's brilliant.  Also, just hearing Venturestein talk about meeting that stupid kid from his sneaker factory training video and learning about the exploitation of the proletariat in notoriously Communist-leaning South (Central?) America.  Shit was great.  Also, it's a really good episode for Hank."
venturebros,2od2o9,tobiathan,2,Fri Dec 5 21:02:35 2014 UTC,"While I love Everybody Comes to Hank's, without more context on the series I think most of the emotion of the revelations in that episode will be lost on a new viewer. Plus if your first introduction to Doc is that episode, I would think it would be hard to find him in anyway likable."
venturebros,2od2o9,usedtobias,1 point,Fri Dec 5 22:09:07 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend Everybody Comes to Hank's for emotional resonance.  I don't think there's a terrible amount of gravity to the episode, honestly!  What significance there is is mostly in Hank, as a goofy teenager made inexplicably smooth by an Indiana Jones hat and a coat of black and white, losing his virginity with a hot older woman.  I don't think that really requires too much context, and to me it was always the most salient emotional thing with the episode.  Doc doesn't really come off as likable, but to me, I guess he seems fairly unlikable in pretty much the entire first season, before we see enough context and history to humanize him.  I remember thinking he was just kind of an awful, self-involved father when I started the show, and thinking that added to the appeal rather than detracting from it.  Before the show became so self-referential, he was just sort of positioned as this reprehensibly aloof Dr. Quest parody, and while I love his character as he is now, I think the show is arguably more accessible with an earlier, more humorous/one-dimensional version."
venturebros,2od2o9,tobiathan,2,Sat Dec 6 07:15:57 2014 UTC,You found the flashback scene with Kate McKinnon bawling her eyes out completely without emotion? I think we may come to the show for different things if the emotional point for you was Hank having sex.. while certainly comedic that wasn't what hit home for me. But to each their own!
venturebros,2od2o9,usedtobias,2,Sat Dec 6 20:51:39 2014 UTC,"Whoa, good call!  I completely forgot that there was that emotional scene.  I mean, I didn't find myself moved by it, and it was yet another indication of Doc being kind of an awful -- or at least, a deeply flawed -- person, but yeah, fair enough."
venturebros,2od2o9,MonarchStarcrack,2,Sun Dec 7 01:45:43 2014 UTC,I highly recommend The Lepidopterists or Hate Floats.  Both have epic scenes that anyone will get.

venturebros,2od2o9,popecollision,1 point,Sat Dec 6 12:43:12 2014 UTC,"I came here to say these very two episodes! Showing people Hate Floats and The Lepidopterists exemplifies very well how the Venture universe operates. And even though you can digest each episode without any prior knowledge of the show, each plot is developed out of events that happened in earlier episodes, which peaks the curiosity of new viewers and gives a glimpse into the depth of story and character development that the show is loved for. Season 1 is just a little too shallow in these areas to give people a proper impression of what they're in for by the time they reach season 5."

Once you see that clip you know you have to watch the show.  And the arcing story of the failed contest between Dr. Venture and Dr. Orpheus encapsulates the repeating failure theme really well.   In later episodes a lot of the humor depends on or builds inside jokes based around the storyline but that one is jam packed and hilarious with no set up but knowing the adventure genre and Jonny Quest.   EDIT: added clip"

A Very Venture Halloween contains a ton of characters without any explanation that a first time viewer will have trouble grasping and being able to separate the people who matter from the background characters, and just generally is so late in the show that it naturally contains a ton of spoilers.

venturebros,2nyrn4,scottmill,9,Mon Dec 1 19:29:24 2014 UTC,"IIRC, it's only colloquially referred to as Rusty's Law. I may be wrong on that, but I hypothesize that Jonas used his pull to make it a rule. The Guild of Calamitous Intent probably had been doing that long before Rusty was a boy adventurer, but Jonas didn't like it happening to his son, so he threw his weight around a bit to outlaw it.    This all speculation, of course, but I think it makes sense."
venturebros,2nyrn4,GeneralDisorder,24,Mon Dec 1 19:55:11 2014 UTC,"Well, the Guild and their arches seem to have a code of conduct worked out as to what's acceptable (which Jonah Jr is hilariously unaware of when the Monarch attacks Spider Skull Island in ""The Lepidopterists"").    I'm thinking that once upon a time, someone captured or tortured Rusty while he had some other medical emergency, and Jonah and Team Venture went totally ape-house on the villain responsible, to the point that the Guild decided to make it a rule to avoid pissing Jonah off like that again."
venturebros,2nyrn4,DBendit,11,Mon Dec 1 20:12:53 2014 UTC,"and Jonah and Team Venture went totally ape-house on the villain responsible,    Well they blinded a guy for sort of kidnapping Rusty, I can't imagine how angry they would be with someone who hurt him."
venturebros,2nyrn4,mysticrudnin,6,Mon Dec 1 22:38:28 2014 UTC,"Colonel Gentleman is completely insane and if the flashbacks of him and Rusty had any bearing he's been an unmerciful monster all along.   Also, the Action Man used guns all the time. Real guns.  Kano was a mountain of a man who maybe in his prime might have stood a chance against Brock Sampson in his prime... Maybe.  We don't know a lot about Major Tom or Antman so maybe they weren't sick ass murder machines like the rest of Team Venture. And Jonas... Oh my Jonas. He tried to activate the Orb. Maybe.

venturebros,2l78sx,SmarterChildv2,1 point,Tue Nov 4 05:55:58 2014 UTC,"I found a 3D model of the monarch online. A friend ripped the model and together we made a flat image of the armor that we transferred to paper. We then cut out the paper and taped it around me to see what needed adjusting (print size of the cutout and what have you).  After making the paper armor, we untaped it and layed it flat on foam. We used a really cheap yoga mat that cut like butter. I would recommend a much more durable foam, but this got the job done. We cut the foam to be the same dimesions as the paper and then taped it and glued it around me, making sure there was wiggle room for me to get in and out. Alternatively you can cut it in the back or the sides and add snaps or zippers.   Once the foam armor was assembled, I applied 4 or 5 layers of yellow latex paint. Make sure that you do medium but even coats, and also make sure that your brush strokes go in the same direction during the later coats to make it look even and smooth. Do extra layers on all the taped and glued parts to strengthen. Gave it a full 24 hours to dry, before applying 3 layers of RUSTOLEUM Marigold gloss color spray paint.  For the emblem, I printed out a logo I found online and cut it out with scissors and a box cutter. Most people would cut it out to make a stencil, but I didn't trust myself to not have the paint spill, so I modge podged the cutout to the armor itself.   All in all, it took about about 4 days to do. Here's a mostly complete guide on how I did it. GOOD LUCK! http://imgur.com/a/O6IBn"

venturebros,2kahhv,Coolguyzack,1 point,Sun Oct 26 00:22:53 2014 UTC,Sweet! Pretty jealous.
venturebros,2k35ge,monkeyvselephant,25,Thu Oct 23 11:41:14 2014 UTC,"Oh yea, I used to babysit you"
venturebros,2k35ge,TheReal63,17,Thu Oct 23 15:05:18 2014 UTC,"Sweet Captain Sunshine shirt, too."
venturebros,2k35ge,BigNikiStyle,16,Thu Oct 23 15:47:38 2014 UTC,"son of a bitch... editing fail on the title, oh well.    first image is from S01E08 - Mid-Life Chrysalis second image is from S05E02 - Venture Libre  General Treister's Son"
venturebros,2k35ge,dmead,4,Thu Oct 23 11:47:00 2014 UTC,"Great catch!  Also, that's horrifiying."
venturebros,2k35ge,Tpmisc00l,11,Thu Oct 23 13:49:50 2014 UTC,i caught it right away.
venturebros,2k35ge,radford_6920,11,Thu Oct 23 19:44:30 2014 UTC,That is downright esoteric.
venturebros,2k35ge,Nordoisthebest,10,Thu Oct 23 20:56:01 2014 UTC,Good luck pickin up that spare
venturebros,2k35ge,sockmonkey16,5,Thu Oct 23 21:47:22 2014 UTC,Is that Mr. Cardholder on the left?
venturebros,2k35ge,moosemccutty,8,Thu Oct 23 18:08:51 2014 UTC,Looks like Hunter.
venturebros,2k35ge,PrivilegeCheckmate,6,Thu Oct 23 20:24:34 2014 UTC,I'm confused about their age difference and time frame. Maybe Treister has more than one son.
venturebros,2k35ge,halfAccurateChang,6,Thu Oct 23 17:21:54 2014 UTC,Hatred is older than you think he is I think.
venturebros,2k35ge,Misinformed_Larry,2,Thu Oct 23 23:59:35 2014 UTC,Is that Hunter standing to his left?
venturebros,2k4awu,munkeyxis,12,Thu Oct 23 18:33:55 2014 UTC,"The Planets by Gustav Holst Very commonly known, Mars and Jupiter are arguably the most famous of the suite.  If you enjoy it, take a look at his First Suite in Eb and Second Suite in F. Also, you might enjoy Dvorak's New World Symphony or Respighi's Pines of Rome."
venturebros,2k4awu,zous,2,Fri Oct 24 07:36:36 2014 UTC,Really a fantastic piece of classical music in general--a great introduction to classical for newbies and children too.
venturebros,2k4awu,sockmonkey16,1 point,Fri Oct 24 17:24:02 2014 UTC,"Ha. I heard this for the first time ever (bar the episode) in a little curiosity shop in camden the other day, wanted to ask why it was but the shopkeeper looked really grumpy"
venturebros,2k4awu,wow_great_name,6,Fri Oct 24 17:49:55 2014 UTC,"Mars, Bringer of War by Holst is very common in scifi/fantasy"
venturebros,2k4awu,AshuraVonXacto,2,Fri Oct 24 14:52:49 2014 UTC,I remember hearing all these pieces from the Planets in The Right Stuff for the 1st time back in the day. Good stuff even if a bit cliche now
venturebros,2k4awu,tulkas71,5,Fri Oct 24 17:20:32 2014 UTC,"Also, this similar song is the one played while everyone is rebuilding the cocoon.."
venturebros,2k4awu,jlevil,4,Thu Oct 23 19:26:15 2014 UTC,I can no longer listen to that piece without starting to giggle.
venturebros,2k4awu,mizmoose,3,Fri Oct 24 14:54:01 2014 UTC,DUDUDUDUH DUH DU DU DU
venturebros,2k4awu,triptonikhan,2,Fri Oct 24 15:36:40 2014 UTC,Awesome find!
venturebros,2k4awu,Laser-Zeppelin,3,Fri Oct 24 00:42:30 2014 UTC,"I got a ringtone of 21 and 24 singing that song off of Zedge a ringtone app, Android version."
venturebros,2k4awu,deadshalldeadremain,1 point,Sat Oct 25 01:36:06 2014 UTC,"Aw yes, Mars! Love that track. I took the audio from the episode and (shittily) edited it together a bit. Tried throwing it on top of the actual original piece, but didn't work out well, and my audio editing skills are not that great."
venturebros,2k1jt5,hornsofdestruction,6,Wed Oct 22 23:16:44 2014 UTC,I saw you both as I was on an elevator going the opposite direction and didn't find you again! You both look incredible.
venturebros,2k1jt5,juiceboxing,3,Thu Oct 23 00:29:23 2014 UTC,"Oh cool!  We got tons of photos taken...it was a hectic day!  Sorry you missed it, we posed with everyone who asked!"
venturebros,2k1jt5,Dr_Mrs_TheM0narch,3,Thu Oct 23 01:00:59 2014 UTC,So you are the one who stole my clothes!
venturebros,2k1jt5,HiFiLi,3,Thu Oct 23 03:09:41 2014 UTC,Love it
venturebros,2k1jt5,yukpurtsun,3,Thu Oct 23 00:04:04 2014 UTC,"Saw you guys there, aside from one henchman there wasn't much love for venture bros this year"
venturebros,2k1jt5,Flooping_Pigs,7,Thu Oct 23 02:12:10 2014 UTC,People carry the love in their hearts.
venturebros,2k1jt5,furtanken,2,Thu Oct 23 02:26:39 2014 UTC,"""Compromise, my friend, is the essence of diplomacy, and diplomacy is the cornerstone of love.""   ""Sweeeet love..."""
venturebros,2k1jt5,yukpurtsun,1 point,Wed Nov 5 03:05:30 2014 UTC,"Indeed.  We were hoping for a group pic, but no luck this year.  We saw one other Dr. Girlfriend, and there may have been a Dr. Mrs. but both were on different days."
venturebros,2k1jt5,decker12,2,Thu Oct 23 04:09:14 2014 UTC,Pretty bummed no venture bros panel but they said its because they are working on the special/ season
venturebros,2k1jt5,kernel_gentleman,2,Thu Oct 23 04:53:20 2014 UTC,"Would love to see more pictures, preferably in a few different angles and without McThor. Wife is thinking about Dr Mrs for Halloween and she's trying to decipher the bits that make up a good costume. Me, I just want to see how well Dr Mrs filled out the costume."
