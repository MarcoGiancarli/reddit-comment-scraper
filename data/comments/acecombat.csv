I only had around 55 fuel (which i had been stocking since i started playing, and i'm an average player at the very best), so the Mobius raptor was way out of reach for me, but damn i wanted that ISAF emblem. (isn't exactly a plane, nor does it require such high rankings, but seeing my rank climb a bit then drop a lot every day was destroying my hope) I figured it wouldn't hurt to make a post here. I was expecting some answers like ""git gud"", but to my (very pleasant) surprise, every single post was of support and advice. Thanks to that, i got the ISAF emblem and i now rock it in both in my Wyern and in my F-5E, and it was a really great feeling when i got those. I think i owe this community one too."

I'm definitely interested in seeing what ranks these aircraft will be placed in, but four aircraft? We really could have just stuck with the Yellow 13.  I will laugh if Yellow 4's aircraft has the worst defense and worst speed out of all of the Yellow aircraft.  But to be honest, my main target in this tourney will be that Erusian emblem.

I wonder if it's the same squadron emblem, or if they're going to pull a Phoenix and either do a missile smoke color change or change the music it plays. Also, why is the low-vis version of the emblem not available like it was the first time? I guess that one will stay rare for the 200 that have it, like myself. Either way, I'm glad I got my Yellow 13 the first time, so all I have to do is worry about the EAF Roundel, and possibly Yellow 4 if they put her low enough in the rankings. Good luck to those of you going for 13. His aircraft is beast, and I'm up to 32, almost 33, part slots on it.  -EDIT-  For some reason, Yellow 13 was buffed to have 26 stock part slots instead of 25. I just checked it out in the aircraft tree, and my five extra part slots added up to 33, and not 32, like they were last night. Does that also mean that the base cost was buffed up to 775 like Yellow 4's? Can anyone else confirm what I suspect?  -EDIT 2-  Checking my level 8 YF-23, which had the same base Cst as Yellow 13 yesterday, it looks like Yellow 13 did get buffed to a 775 bast Cst, a 25 base Cst upgrade. The stats also reflect that, as my speed and mobility got upgraded to S+ for no reason. Is this the first time a plane has had it's base Cst buffed?"

Which would be ok, but...instead of your wingmen and allies respecting you as they did in AC04, the allied units in ACX actually sound like they're about to suck your dick (assuming you're male).

Its narrative is weak, but it's relatively stable, and arguably suffers most (other than being a stock standard plot) from not developing its villains particularly well.  The gameplay?  Eh,  it's okay. DFM is way too gimmicky in my opinion, but there's still seven bucks worth of fun to be had with it.  So if it's on sale for that little?  It still might be worth checking out.  Just don't pay 60 bucks for it.    Ace Combat 6 is the better choice for  the 360 by a wide, wide margin.  The PSP games are both pretty all right and worth playing.

acecombat,3dz53c,BERKUT118,2,Mon Jul 20 21:35:33 2015 UTC,Looks like it's an anime based on AC3
acecombat,3dw6bj,Captainobvious89,15,Mon Jul 20 01:10:09 2015 UTC,An F-15 F-14 shot down a satellite The SOLG
acecombat,3dw6bj,PAK-FAace,7,Mon Jul 20 01:42:40 2015 UTC,Yes. Yes it did.
acecombat,3dw6bj,lockspeed-99,13,Mon Jul 20 02:02:51 2015 UTC,"No. 9:    There was little suprise that Typhoon, with its world-class agility and high off-boresight missile capability was able to dominate ""Within Visual Range"" flight, but the aircraft did cause a suprise by getting a radar lock on the F22 at a suprisingly long range. The F-22s cried off, claiming that they were ""unstealthed"" anyway, although the next day´s scheduled two vs. two BWR engagement was canceled, and ""the USAF decided they didn´t want to play any more .   ""International AIR POWER REVIEW"" - year 2006, issue 20, page 45. - ISNB: 1-880588-91-9 (casebound) or ISBN: 1473-9917    Must have been a massive ""oh, cock"" moment."
acecombat,3dw6bj,Mu-1,8,Mon Jul 20 06:17:50 2015 UTC,I imagine a multi-million dollar investment's core feature of being 'stealthy' not doing what it's supposed to do is a good reason to start setting fire to money.

acecombat,3dw6bj,PAK-FAace,4,Mon Jul 20 08:33:09 2015 UTC,"Well, that was 2006. With it being 2015, it's obvious the F-22 has gotten block upgrades since then to improve it's systems."
acecombat,3dw6bj,firedfns13,6,Mon Jul 20 12:42:05 2015 UTC,I'm not so sure you can fix unstealthy geometry with block upgrades. You may be able to get better electronics/algorithms/radar though.    I bet our European cousins surpassed our capabilities after we invested so heavily in our naval radars back in the 70s and 80s
acecombat,3dw6bj,PAK-FAace,2,Mon Jul 20 13:21:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe not the geometry, but stealth coating can be improved, as well as the AESA radar being able to jam an enemies radar."
acecombat,3dw6bj,firedfns13,2,Mon Jul 20 15:12:29 2015 UTC,That's true.  We certainly don't tell our allies exactly what we're capable of.  Perhaps they chose to use different components they expected better performance from or under estimated the Europeans
acecombat,3dw6bj,VladTheInstaller,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:31:04 2015 UTC,"AFIAK, the F-22 has excellent stealth geometry and RAM coating but plenty of countries can field radar systems in bandwidths that effectively ignore stealth geometry. I wonder if the the Typhoon was using those systems in that engagement or were there other factors?"
acecombat,3dw6bj,lockspeed-99,5,Mon Jul 20 23:28:48 2015 UTC,has it?
acecombat,3dw6bj,PAK-FAace,3,Mon Jul 20 13:07:43 2015 UTC,Yes. The F-22 from 2006 is inferior to the F-22 in 2015  Here's the Block Upgrade form: http://www.ausairpower.net/USAF/F-22A-Roadmap-1S.jpg  EDIT: Heres an info graphic that explains it in more detail. The F-22 is supposed to be the F-22C(No COFFIN unfortunately) by 2018.

acecombat,3dw6bj,huepaperplane98,2,Mon Jul 20 17:01:14 2015 UTC,"The F-15 produces enough lift with its fuselage that it was still able to fly with a missing wing.  Car bodies do the same thing.  They're not an ideal airfoil shape, but they're close enough.  Some old race cars, before people figured out the aero bits, generated enough lift at speed that their front ends go so light that they were nearly unsteerable and lost most of their braking ability until the front wheels settled back down onto the track and regained enough mechanical grip."

acecombat,3dw6bj,ConstipatedDucks,4,Mon Jul 20 05:08:29 2015 UTC,"13 actually happened (that is, probably), but the plane was not flying straight; it was diving, and the ballistic trajectory of the round, toghether with the fact that projectiles lose speed in flight (while the airplane has an engine to keep its speed), made the rounds land as the plane was passing. They were practice rounds, but still managed to screw up the engine.  I remember a pretty detailed read on this, but i cannot remember where it is. If i find it i'll link it here."

I also love geopolitics, and my childhood was a bit weird: instead of playing with friends (i did try, but bullying didn't let me), i used to research about history, especially if it was aircraft-related or warfare-related (even better if it mixed both!). As such, as a small child (around 6 or 7 years) i basically knew lots of stories about WWII pilots and the lucky bastard who flew an F-15 home with only one wing and how the british radars were crucial to their victory in the Battle of Britain, as well as how old biplanes sunk the biggest warship in the world (and the pride of the german navy) on its maiden voyage in WWII, and the crazy german Stuka pilot who dropped a 1000 kg bomb on a Soviet battleship after he had gone far below the ""safe"" altitude for dropping it and not only escaped the explosion but also a near-crash into the ocean. Now imagine how much people thought i was weird :P  The only classes in history i find slightly boring are those about egypt and mesopotamy and all these early civilizations. at Greece and Rome things start to become slightly more interesting but not so much. As soon as we start to look at the middle ages i start to like it a lot, and by the 17th-18th century and onwards, i love studying almost everything about it."

F-16s have always been my starting go-to plane in all AC games i've played.  3:MiG-29 -LB-: i got the Block 1 morgan but i was really disappointed by it. with the Libra MiG, i finally had a chance to compete with other planes in air-to-air combat, and i used it for a looong time.  4: F/A-18: despite having a short reign, it deserves mention for being awesome and for serving me well as a main workhorse in all AC games i've played so far.  5: Pixy's Morgan: when this became available in the ticket store, i was like ""OOOOH YES."" I immediately bought it and it is probably the plane that served as my main choice for the longest time so far.  6:X-02 Wyern: i sprinted to it in the aircraft tree, and it is the only plane i've gotten to lvl.7 so far. Since AC:4, my first ace combat game, i absolutely love it and it is my favorite end-game aircraft in the whole series. Since it is pretty much a top-tier aircraft, it is unlikely to be ever replaced.  The bad thing about going like crazy to the X-02 was that it left me behind in all other branches of the tree. when the F-22 skin came i had to research a lot to get to it, but i did it and got the skin.

Seriously, if they wanted to make him a more interesting and compelling villain, they needed to do a lot of what you said.

Let's just say I consider it to be a worse game than AH. At least AH was kinda cool on the first playthrough and had a good soundtrack and stuff. JA... not even that, just pure boredom. The mission design, the horrendously slow handling, everything.  The fact that they actually called it ""X2"", as in supposedly a successor to what's actually a good AC game, is just rubbing salt on the wound."
acecombat,3dt8z1,10Sly10,4,Sun Jul 19 16:19:59 2015 UTC,"His last name originates from Albania   I'm 100% Albanian and I didn't even realize this. My dad is damn good with Albanian names so I'll ask him about Sulejmani. Funny thing, Sulejmani screams about his honor and life, and the national motto of Albania has to do with honor. Also funny thing, the Joint Assault track sometimes labeled ""Cyclops Slayer"" uses instruments and melodies that you'd hear in Albanian songs. A little national pride for you (even though I consider myself American rather than Albanian).  But I digress. As for your main points, the problem here is that you're trying to improve the story of a game that was abysmal in all regards. Joint Assault is somewhat similar to H.A.W.X. 2 because they tried to fit as many different types of archetypical Ace Combat missions into the real world. Lasers, flying fortresses, ""ace"" squadrons (which was just Varcolac pulling a Strigon every few missions), they even tried to have a Scinfaxi-like encounter but it ended up being stupid.  As /u/PositronCannon said, Assault Horizon is better than Joint Assault in many regards. (Possible bias since I'm one of the few people who like Assault Horizon, but its improvements over Joint Assault are very objective.) At least Assault Horizon doesn't change the damn music five times in the same mission, and at least Assault Horizon has one superweapon, Trinity, to keep track of. Joint Assault? We've got the two Spiridus, not-gonna-bother-to-count Orgoi, the Hi-TASM, the IRCMs on the Spiridus, the laser weapons on the Spiridus, and the Balaur on the Spiridus and the standalone Balaur, and sure, why not nuclear missile silos."
acecombat,3dt8z1,triadorion,4,Sun Jul 19 16:35:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I personally preferred Joint Assault because its story was so fucking bonkers.  It felt a lot closer to Strangereal than Assault Horizon.  Horizon was a more coherent narrative, but it was also a story that didn't bring anything terribly interesting to the table; with Markov being only marginally better a villain than Sulejmani.    Honestly, Ace Combat has frequently been pulpy as hell, when you get down to it.  It felt more to me that Joint Assault embraced that, and in being utterly ridiculous, felt closer to being like Ace Combat in the Real World.  Infinity does it better now, but Joint Assault was what convinced me that you could still do ridiculous, fun stuff on Ace Combat's vision of Earth."
acecombat,3dt8z1,10Sly10,3,Sun Jul 19 17:17:14 2015 UTC,"But Ace Combat has never been like Joint Assault. JA introduced a new superweapon every two missions, changed music five times in the same mission, was paced horribly, had cardboard characters, and was all kinds of boring. Sure, it's closer to Strangereal than Assault Horizon, but Assault Horizon never tried to be like Strangereal and that was just fine. Joint Assault tried way too fucking hard to be like Strangereal and messed up the whole thing."
acecombat,3dt8z1,triadorion,4,Sun Jul 19 17:37:33 2015 UTC,"Music changing didn't bug me at all.  Again, I found the characters just as cardboard in Assault Horizon, though I tend to find the latter worse because I found Guts rather grating whereas in Joint Assault they were merely dull as dishwater while being inoffensive.  I'm not one of those people who generally thinks Assault Horizon is some kind of cardinal sin against the franchise, but for the most part I think its tonal shift toward every other modern warfare franchise ever was something that sucked a lot of vitality out of it for me.    Joint Assault was bonkers and stupid, but at least ""biggest corporate insurance fraud in history"" was a better hook than the stock  standard ""Russian Separatists Get a Nuke/Not-Nuke"" that AH ran with.   Ultimately, there may have been an abundance of superweapons and ridiculous stuff in Joint Assault, but that made it a damn sight more entertaining (even in a completely brainless way) than just a guy in a PAK-FA with a glorified cruise missile and a chip on his shoulder.  But that's me, obviously.   I still would never hold Joint Assault as a particularly good game in the franchise either.  It was entertaining in a profoundly stupid and over-the-top manner, and it at least made a (failed) effort to be somewhat creative, whereas I felt AH was just... overly stock standard and dull.  I think I'm just a man who appreciates the absurd more than something that's more stable but less interesting."

acecombat,3dt8z1,10Sly10,3,Mon Jul 20 14:10:00 2015 UTC,"Just some further notes about Sulejmani's name from my dad (believe me, give him a name and he'll tell you everything):  Miloš is a Serbian name, but when it's spelled Milosz, it's closer to Polish and Hungarian, especially of Muslim descent.  Sulejmani is closer to Turkish than any other nationality, but it's used by Serbians and Albanians as well.  However, both names have roots in the Ottoman Empire, so it's no surprise that they come from countries in that region since the Ottomans controlled basically the entire region in their heyday.  It doesn't explain anything, especially the child soldier comment (I don't know of any modern countries in that region that use child soldiers), but it's just some fun little factoids in case anyone is interested."

acecombat,3dr561,Thexare,7,Sun Jul 19 20:43:44 2015 UTC,"I think the Aircraft Tree needs the ACX fictional planes like the Fregata, Cariburn/Caliburn, Forneus, and Apalis.  And what they really need to be is like they were in ACX: not overpriced superplanes.  I think these could fill in some serious holes in the tree by providing reasonably priced aircraft with distinct performances with unusual SP Weapon combinations.  LiquidSnake mentioned having some aircraft with unique extremes in performance, and these planes can kind of deliver that, especially the Cariburn/Caliburn.    While we're at it, let's include some more Body class parts that decrease performance in one area to raise another.  They've already started adding in the Mobility Down/Speed Up parts, so why not stuff like Stability Down/Mobility Up or Speed Down/Defense Up, or something along those lines?  Allow us to more directly tune our planes to suit our needs; things that might not objectively make a plane better, so much as things that will make them suit your desired handling.  Beyond that, I think a greater diversity of attackers that were viable would be nice, as well as some more bombers like the Stratofortress and the Blackjack.  People have mentioned some attackers that would be nice to see too, like the Jaguar and the Tornado.    ...And if they add WWII propeller fighters I'm all over that."

And with as clunky as the flight is in it and the PSP Ace Combats, weight increases are generally unacceptable.  So long as Infinity keeps away from that, this would be a good thing to work from.  And I reckon for the sake of making them worth using, Up/Down parts would probably have greater effect and/or better equip efficiency than simple straight upgrades."

The E variant then evolves into the F-15 S/MTD upon being exposed to a moon stone (It was developed by NASA after all). Now I really want someone to draw/animate that....

This means that the vast majority of designs will be from those two places. The fact that they don't have the rights to the other main EU jet (Tornado) means that that won't be appearing. Also consider that so many other European countries used, still use, and will use American designs like the F-4, F-5, and F-35, respectively.  The F-15 and F-16 are truly international designs like the MiG-21, MiG-29 and Su-27 series. The F-14 series is currently ONLY used by Iran's airforce (which appears to have the honour of first A2A kill with the jet, and most successful pilot in an F-14).  Finally, there will be no Chinese jets (let's face it, due to nationalist reasons) so that will rule out J-10, J-20, J-31, JH-7, Q-5 and other major Chinese domestic aircraft.

The Eagle is one of my favorite airframes as it is. Now you add canards and thrust vectoring? You've got a deal. I'm not a big fan of the boxy nozzles on the S/MTD as opposed to the ACTIVE, but eh. Su-33 / Su-37 / any Flanker with canards aside of the Su-34. To complete my holy trinity of European/American/Russian, basically the same principle as the MTD: already sexy Flanker + canards? I'm sold. I prefer the Su-33 because of the slightly increased wing area, but the difference is small. Gripen. It's kinda like the Typhoon's little but deadly brother, almost as good of a triangle. Shame it usually gets crappy weapons in AC, but rockets are fun even if not optimal. MiG-1.44.

Much better than his ugly cousin the Fulcrum. Mig 31: Big nozzles, enough reasons. F-35A: It can be a crap, ok. Still, is beautiful, much more than the F-16. ONLY the A variant. Infinity´s F-35 just seem out of scale seeing those wings. S/MTD: I´m not a huge fan of the F-15 family. However, the S/MTD is amazing. It has rectangular nozzles, canards, the antenna exceling it radome... If only has more stylized shape in the cockpit part it would be my favourite plane.

Since AC:04, my first Ace Combat, i really love this plane. while it is not very realistic, it sure looks awesome, and its performance is also superb.  2 (tie): F-16C and MiG-29. well, it helped get me into liking aviation. Since i was a small child, i used to play Novalogic's F-16 and MiG-29. in all ace combats i've ever played (04, 05, 0:TBW, AH and ACI), i bought the F-16 as soon as it became available and used it as my workhorse until unlocking the F/A-18; they are also very beautiful aircraft. Oh, the memories of Lifeline, Invincible fleet and Deep strike...  3:F/A-18. It was also an aircraft that i bought as soon as it became available and used it until very later on. It is very versatile and i also have very fond memories of it in Ace Combat.  4: F-22. Because MOOOOBIUS, DAMN YEAH  5: (tie) F-5E and Gripen. Well, i love my country (Brazil; keep in mind though, i'm not a blind nationalist or disrespectful to other countries, in fact i respect other countries just like i respect mine), so the fact the F-5E is the aircraft used by FAB and the Gripen is to soon (read: in a few years) be used by it makes me somewhat biased towards them.  Honorable mentions:  Embraer AMX A-1M and Embraer A-29 Super Tucano. Both of them are aircraft i think deserve an appearance in Ace Combat (if they can include not-very-relevant variants [looking at you, F-15J] of extremely relevant aircraft and prototypes that are basically mockups at the time [looking at you, ATD-0], i can't see why not), and about the Super Tucano specifically, well, when the US air force chooses a Latin American aircraft instead of a US one in a competition (even though they're destined for Afghanistan's air force), you know it's good :P"

In Ace Combat it being a low tier aircraft has never stopped me from using it when I probably shouldn't.  Like taking on Pixy.  The only game I really had to retire it in was in Joint Assault where the dodging mechanics made it way too hard to evade anything, especially with the PSP's crappy analog stick.  I've also had a certain fondness for the F/A-18 family for a long time too.  It was a good go-to plane for any mission except basically in AC6 where it was just underwhelming (especially once the Strike Eagle unlocked).

No matter how much the talking heads at marketing say, there will never be a ""silver bullet"" role for any combat aircraft; they have to specialize and combined force is the only proven way. In addition, the logistical support for the F-35 is only readily available in the US, and hence, only US will probably have the least amount of problems deploying it. Meanwhile, all the other nations are going to be shafted in that regard.  So no, no faith from me. Come back when F-35 has participated in a major war and proven itself capable of flying back, shot to pieces, can be repaired quickly and fly again within days.

acecombat,3dsa0v,OmegaEGG,2,Sun Jul 19 17:10:16 2015 UTC,"Again, the F-22 was not meant to be sold to other countries. Stealth aircraft having secretive development, sure, I understand, but the F-35 is unique in that it is meant to be sold to other countries. In other multinational development project (cf, Typhoon, Tornado, even the Alpha Jet), every country knows where things are supposed to be. Meanwhile, the US Government alone knows where the F-35 is at its development stage.  Also, the F-35 is supposed to replace A-10s and other CAS aircraft, and with a planned IOC in 2016. IOC with the softwares to fire the gun missing is not much of an IOC is it? Furthermore, the US might not be in a major war, but is it not that the A-10 continues to serve in the Middle Eastern theater? And they suffered operational damages? If the F-35 is slated to replace that, then yes, that kind of durability and serviceability is the thing to look out for, and the F-35 is maintenance heavy for that.   As for countries pre-emptively selling/scrapping their fleet, well, that's their problem.   Not helped because of US marketing's promises."
acecombat,3dsa0v,lockspeed-99,2,Mon Jul 20 06:11:50 2015 UTC,"Every partner nation in the JSF program has complete access to the F-35's progress; hell most of the nations themselves have some share of development as well (eg, Norway and Australia alone are responsible for funding gun integration on the F-35A).   IOC with the softwares to fire the gun missing is not much of an IOC is it?  Furthermore, the US might not be in a major war, but is it not that the A-10 continues to serve in the Middle Eastern theater?   No weapons system enters combat immediately at IOC; the F-35 will have the ability to use it's gun (likely years) before it sees combat. Ultimately though, the gun is a low priority weapon, even taking it's CAS duties into consideration.   And they suffered operational damages?   They suffer damages because they fly directly into the enemy's WEZ. F-16s, F/A-18s, F-15Es, etc perform the vast majority of CAS in the Middle East, yet they very rarely come home riddled with damage from small arms.   If the F-35 is slated to replace that, then yes, that kind of durability and serviceability is the thing to look out for, and the F-35 is maintenance heavy for that.   It's too early at the moment to get real maintenance performance data for the F-35 (most of it's maintainers are either civilians or military personnel with fairly limited work hours on the F-35), but in general it's been described as not being overly maintenance heavy - most of the issues sit with ALIS (giving false alarms that take time to verify they're a non-issue - that's significantly improving), or with minor issues that are being reported and changed."
acecombat,3dsa0v,Dragon029,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:55:44 2015 UTC,"Well at least ALIS is being upgraded so it's...at least not resisting any change from the ground crew.  Sad though, ALIS sounds like an amazing idea for a self-diagnostics tool for an aircraft. It really needs a lot of ironing out though.  Wonder if ALIS will eventually be standardized across all of US aircraft inventory."
acecombat,3dsa0v,lockspeed-99,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:31:49 2015 UTC,"A lot of aircraft have their own individual logistics / maintenance systems similar (but not quite as automated) as ALIS - maybe they'll try and expand it for future aircraft (eg, if the Boeing+LM team wins the LRS-B contract, maybe they'll use a direct ALIS derivative), but for other existing aircraft I don't think we'll see it adopted."
acecombat,3dsa0v,Dragon029,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:43:32 2015 UTC,"Every nation participating in the JSF program has complete access to the F-35's progress, since they are part of the development as well. Although, /u/Dragon029 seems to got you covered on that. I'd like to add, though, that there will be one or several things the U.S. keeps to themselves. Can't share all the secrets, right?  The F-35 is capable of Close Air Support, but it was never meant to replace the A-10 (which is why there is a lot of opposition that keeps it from replacing my A-10). Before I continue on, first understand what Close Air Support really is. CAS is about destroying targets within the vicinity of blues on the ground. It isn't just flying really low to provide gun assistance to friendlies on the ground. You can fly really high, drop high precision bombs on targets that friendlies need to be destroyed, and call it CAS. Really, any aircraft can perform CAS, even the F-22 or a bomber. Now back to the F-35. If the F-35 does really end up replacing my Warthog, all it has to do is equip guided bombs and fly high enough to be able to evade from anti-aircraft systems while being able to precisely drop the bomb.  Although, I do agree that the U.S. needs to work on their marketing of export aircraft in general."
acecombat,3dsa0v,OmegaEGG,2,Mon Jul 20 17:05:04 2015 UTC,"I know what CAS is. One argument against the F-35 is its loiter capability, which the A-10 has. There will be a big shift in doctrine for CAS, because if you can use both guns and precision munitions, you will not require as many aircrafts to compensate for rearming times.  Moot point if the F-35 isn't replacing A-10 though. F-35 can perform precision strikes for both CAS and interdiction strikes, so they can either help the A-10s and alleviate the load or do a literal Joint Assault for a wider theater. All good then."
acecombat,3dsa0v,lockspeed-99,2,Mon Jul 20 18:20:24 2015 UTC,"I just don't want them to replace the A-10 with a fighter. :( Keep the A-10, pls."
acecombat,3dsa0v,OmegaEGG,2,Tue Jul 21 01:58:41 2015 UTC,A-10 will always have a place. Hopefully...
acecombat,3dsa0v,lockspeed-99,2,Tue Jul 21 04:39:33 2015 UTC,"I know guys who work on the F-35's at Nellis, and the only complaint I ever heard from them is how much louder it is when taking off.   I don't have any personal experience with it beyond watching them sortie a crap ton when I was at Nellis, but I don't see a real bad attitude about them anywhere in the air force right now. And it's not like it's going to take over our forces completely and instantly either. We're still flying F-16's pretty regularly, especially with guard units, our current aresenal will still exist to a considerable degree even when the F-35 is introduced. Not like we're scrapping that many planes just because of it. And who knows where we'll be overall for the military once the F-35 is operational and we look at whatever our next major step will be."
acecombat,3dsa0v,Hader102,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:24:37 2015 UTC,"Fair enough then. The image is sure about F-35 replacing everything and anything though.   Even then, the F-35 might perform its best only if it has the might of US Armed Forces' logistics. When it is sold to other countries, it becomes a question whether or not they'd have the same logistics capability."
acecombat,3dsa0v,lockspeed-99,2,Mon Jul 20 06:14:06 2015 UTC,"It should be decent - for one thing, the supply chain is global, so logistics support doesn't have to be done by that country, but at the same time, it doesn't require sending equipment or aircraft to the US; instead there'll be Italy, Britain, Turkey, Australia and Japan as major maintenance hubs.  The maintenance contracts are being opened too which will meant there'll be competition for sustaining fleets."
acecombat,3dsa0v,Dragon029,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:00:09 2015 UTC,Is the stealth material the F-35 built with cleared for export? Isn't a major damage to the skin means it's back to Lockheed?
acecombat,3dsa0v,lockspeed-99,2,Mon Jul 20 08:32:32 2015 UTC,"Yep; it is cleared for export under tight controls - parts of the aircraft (made from the same RAM-embedded composite) are built around the world and shipped to the final assembly plants in the US, Italy and (in a few years) Japan.   With composite aircraft, normally you either apply patches or completely replace entire panels that make up the skin, simply because you can't just beat out dents, or weld rips, etc.   There's been some concerns that a global logistics system will make it harder to keep the F-35's tech a secret (ya don't think?), but ultimately part of what makes the F-35 what it is are the advanced manufacturing techniques and specific materials used.   If you're someone like China and you want to copy the exact materials, it's neither going to be cheap nor quick to set up the supply chains and generate the expertise required to pull off successful production. Boeing's Phantom Works (one of the most advanced aerospace engineering teams in the world, akin to Lockheed's Skunk Works) for example tried to pull off a one-piece composite top skin for their X-32, but despite multiple attempts they just couldn't get it to cure without forming bubbles, etc which are catastrophic to structural integrity. If China doesn't spend the time and money to develop their industries before hand, it won't matter how much data or samples they steal; they'll either waste a ton of money in wasted expensive materials, or build aircraft that rip apart when they pull Gs.   Isn't a major damage to the skin means it's back to Lockheed?   Nope, it'd go to one of the major maintenance hubs (Japan, Aus, Italy, etc) - the current plan is for those plants to be local (big) companies (like TAE, Alenia, BAE, etc) overseen by Lockheed (and in turn, the US DoD who owns the schematics & data), but with sustainment being made a competitive process, that could be outsourced / swapped to someone else if they can provide better bang-for-buck."

acecombat,3dsa0v,lockspeed-99,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:03:03 2015 UTC,"What is?  If you mean the jet, then US Marines are declaring the jet operational (even with it's 2B software) within the next 11 days; the USAF goes live next year; multiple international nations already have a few aircraft of their own; it's already partaking in large scale training exercises like Green Flag West, etc.  If you mean the logistics chain, then not really - the first Italian-built F-35s rolled out of the Alenia factory earlier this year, and by the end of the decade there'll be maintenance hubs standing up around the world. Already many (relatively large, eg: vertical stabilisers) F-35 parts are being made around the world. ALIS is being focused on and should be up to a good standard by the 3F software release in 2017, etc."

acecombat,3dsa0v,VladTheInstaller,0,Sun Jul 19 15:10:31 2015 UTC,Blame Boeing then for not utilizing the McD JSF concept which I personally think was a winner.
acecombat,3dsa0v,PAK-FAace,3,Sun Jul 19 15:14:55 2015 UTC,"The McD concept was flawed in that it relied on using something like 18 pipes to route gases from the engine to drive the lift-fan; compared to the X-32 and X-35, it was overly complex."
acecombat,3dsa0v,Dragon029,4,Sun Jul 19 22:21:17 2015 UTC,"In short; the F-35 pilot wasn't told ""go try and beat that F-16"", he was told ""go into high-alpha, experiment with different maneuvers and try and screw with the flight software; here's an F-16 to use as a tracking aid"".  Then, during the testing, the pilot found that the software that stops it from doing this stuff (this is what it looks like if those sorts of things happen at low-level) and automatically gets the pilot out of those situations was actually overpowered and needed to be toned down. Some fancy flight-control blending to make maneuvering easier was also poorly tuned and needed a significant shift to make it easier to fight on the edge.  And of course, although he wasn't trying to fully simulate combat with the F-16, if it was a real fight, it would've helped to have had all the critical combat systems installed in the jet (they're not in this one because it's designed to carry high speed cameras and to put itself into situations where there's a good chance of it crashing)."

Maybe because i was raised that way, that's just me"
acecombat,3dsa0v,AsterLong,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:40:33 2015 UTC,"Each Variant is highly different, the F-35B has unique fuselage to accommodate the Lift Fan. The F-35 was designed to USAF specifications first and foremost.  https://i.imgur.com/WdOZcNF.jpg  Point 13 shows how you get an aircraft like the F-35 with the USAF requirements https://comprehensiveinformation.wordpress.com/   I always prefer ""the right man for the right job"". Maybe because i was raised that way, that's just me.   This might explain things a bit better to you.  For example the wars against Iraq in 1991 and 2003 featured, as their initial priority operation, a carefully orchestrated and methodical neutralisation of communications systems, command and control nodes, surveillance and warning systems, defensive missile systems, and aircraft and their logistical support on the ground. The results were, in each case, a quick and comprehensive denial of an adversary’s ability to mount most, if not all, air operations. There were few aircraft-on-aircraft engagements in the 1991 Gulf War, and none in the war of 2003.   This is the way our future air force would want to operate to achieve air superiority, in preference to fighting air battles of attrition— glamorous and gladiatorial though air battles may be. An adversary’s air capabilities are better destroyed on the ground than in the air. Thus the fundamental keys to air superiority in coming decades will be reach and precision, exercised by a determined leadership that is prepared to seize the initiative.  Of course the ability to give battle in the air still needs to be retained. Any air campaign will still call on an ability to fight and win air to air engagements, and we cannot assume that our initial strike operations will succeed fully. So there is an immense dividend to be gained by an air force that can, through the use of a single aircraft type, conduct decisive air-to-ground campaigns but then swing roles to fight air battles where necessary. That means precious resources are not tied up in a second specialised aircraft type dedicated to what should be, in doctrinal terms, a subsidiary (but still necessary) purpose.

acecombat,3dojvo,Fatocaster,3,Sat Jul 18 07:50:24 2015 UTC,"This just reminds me that I missed out on buying the EX FALKEN when I saw it on Rakuten's global market. Shit's sold out now, and I highly doubt Bandai's going to rerelease it like they do with their gendums."
acecombat,3dojvo,Fatocaster,2,Sat Jul 18 00:04:18 2015 UTC,Definitely not. It's far too old.
acecombat,3dojvo,Red-Spacecat,2,Sat Jul 18 00:10:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's actually what killed me when I saw that the kit was sold out; when I saw it a couple months ago, dude had a couple still in stock, and I couldn't jump on it because I was flat busted.  Well, I guess there's always stalking Mandarake, for all the good that will do."
acecombat,3dojvo,Fatocaster,2,Sat Jul 18 00:23:23 2015 UTC,"Well, there's this. I tried to contact the seller to ask what the state of the model itself was, never got a response. Maybe you have more luck."
acecombat,3dojvo,Ikillu4ever93,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:54:02 2015 UTC,"Bit late, but thanks for bringing it to my attention. I'll look into it."
acecombat,3dojvo,Fatocaster,2,Sun Jul 19 10:49:13 2015 UTC,"But $90? I mean, it looks like it's hard to come by, but $90?   [Says the douchebag who spent well over 1.5 grand on Ace Combat Infinity. I'm one to talk.]"
acecombat,3dojvo,Ikillu4ever93,3,Sat Jul 18 02:35:34 2015 UTC,"Resin kits tend to be pretty up there in price.  In general, $90 is actually kinda inexpensive for a resin kit; at least, one that I've seen. Mind you, the only other resin kits I've paid attention to were B-Club conversion kits for Gundam model kits and the occasional all-resin kit like the 1/100 scale Kshatriya."
acecombat,3dojvo,totallyknowyou,2,Sat Jul 18 03:43:34 2015 UTC,"Wow. $90 is inexpensive for these kinds of things? Man, the more you know, I guess..."

acecombat,3dojvo,Ikillu4ever93,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:28:53 2015 UTC,So why don't you stop yourself?
acecombat,3dojvo,totallyknowyou,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:40:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know. It's just that, some tournaments have prizes that I really want, like Garuda, for example. I wanted to take top 200 in that tournament because, along with the F-15E -GD- and the Garuda Low-Vis emblem, I wanted the Talisman nickname. So, the last few days of the tournament, I bough over $100 worth of fuel to boost myself to the top 200. With some buddies, I managed to get myself in the top 200, and manger to help my friends get in the top 1000, since they decided to go for Garuda, too.   That was an example. There was also the Strigon Su-33, which was a top 200, so you know how much that would usually go for. And I used to buy fuel every two weeks."
acecombat,3dojvo,Ikillu4ever93,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:53:01 2015 UTC,You really do have a problem.. that is absurd.  Edit: You do realize that this game won't be online forever and because of that the money spent won't be worth it? I give this game another year or two at best before the servers go offline.
acecombat,3dojvo,Muf4sa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:15:46 2015 UTC,I know. I'm well aware.
acecombat,3dntn3,lockspeed-99,7,Fri Jul 17 19:59:07 2015 UTC,Fun fact to people who don't know it: Basic data link is arguably the best datalink in the game.  The reload speed is only marginally worse than Quick Reload. Homing is actually noticeably good and quicker lock-on time is always appreciated.
acecombat,3dntn3,FunyaaFireWire,3,Fri Jul 17 20:20:31 2015 UTC,"When you say marginally worse, how much marginally worse, out of curiosity?  I'm wondering if I should switch over to Basic for some of my sets or not.  If you have the specifics, anyway."
acecombat,3dntn3,triadorion,5,Fri Jul 17 21:37:24 2015 UTC,Base reload 4.1s  With basic 3.1s  With quick recharge 2.9s
acecombat,3dntn3,FunyaaFireWire,2,Sat Jul 18 01:58:46 2015 UTC,"...Oh wow.  That really is miniscule, especially if you're trading for extra homing and lock-on speed, the latter of which might save you the .2 seconds anyway by letting you get the shot off faster.  Thanks for the info and tip!  :D"
acecombat,3dntn3,triadorion,2,Sat Jul 18 03:03:39 2015 UTC,They stack with reload parts though. Ever tried using all the parts and the Datalink together?
acecombat,3dntn3,the_warrior_saint,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:11:30 2015 UTC,"Huh! I did not figure that at all. Great info, thanks!"
acecombat,3dntn3,ApatheticGod,2,Sat Jul 18 08:30:16 2015 UTC,But I love my Quick Reload Datalink :<
acecombat,3dntn3,FunyaaFireWire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:00:06 2015 UTC,"Word?, so basic is better? I had no idea. Does the data link help me, or just whom I'm linked with?"
acecombat,3dntn3,sneakysnake128,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:48:50 2015 UTC,It depends. The homing and increased lock-on speed doesn't matter if you're lining up really good shots that instantly lock-on before your missles reload. I normally take quick recharge for raids / A2G now. Never know when the basic homing might kick in and help you secure a kill when playing fighter.  Datalink unfortunately only helps yourself as long as you're in link range. The other player gets his own selected link.
acecombat,3dntn3,Doctor_Dan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:40:32 2015 UTC,"But the more missiles, the more it adds up? So it is better for multi lock on?"
acecombat,3dntn3,triadorion,4,Sat Jul 18 07:33:33 2015 UTC,"But on the good side: Modding aircraft is significantly cheaper now. Equipping Compressor LL, Sp.W Homing, and other new parts won't cost 6000-10000 (Or other uncomfortably large amount of) credits on high-level aircrafts anymore."
acecombat,3dntn3,Fatocaster,3,Fri Jul 17 20:23:38 2015 UTC,"I noticed that too, and thank god for it.  Modding my Phantom used to be prohibitively expensive... but now it's reasonable again.  Cheap, even.  I love this change."
acecombat,3dntn3,Fatocaster,2,Fri Jul 17 21:38:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed."
acecombat,3dntn3,triadorion,2,Fri Jul 17 20:59:38 2015 UTC,"Seems more like modding prices have been standardized, because it actually got a bit more expensive to mod my usual jets, which tend to sit at level 4 and 5."
acecombat,3dop21,mega-dark,3,Sat Jul 18 00:17:32 2015 UTC,Sounds like bad lag. From what I hear this tournament is quite laggy for a lot of people
acecombat,3dop21,turboronin,2,Sat Jul 18 00:56:21 2015 UTC,Oh it was absolutely awful in the first few hours of the Tournament. It's like everyone and their mother decided to go on TDM at once.
acecombat,3dop21,Ikillu4ever93,2,Sat Jul 18 02:33:22 2015 UTC,Everyone's raring to kill people in their level 15+ oinky doinkers.
acecombat,3dop21,lockspeed-99,2,Sat Jul 18 03:02:36 2015 UTC,Yep. I will shoot down that Yayoi Mirage that shot me down. You have no idea how embarrassing it is to be shot down by an idolmaster plane.

acecombat,3dop21,Ikillu4ever93,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:34:37 2015 UTC,I describe AC:I's TDM mode as three things:   A badass F-4E air show. Utter chaos. 4AAM spam land.
acecombat,3dmbgq,ComradePutinCCCP1917,6,Fri Jul 17 12:52:11 2015 UTC,"It is probably also because the MR reset, so you have skilled players with high level vanilla or SP clubbing on nuggets.  It should balance out in a day or so. Also I'd recommend flying fighter if you have one decently upgraded."
acecombat,3dmbgq,turboronin,6,Fri Jul 17 13:06:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that part is a mess.  I really don't feel right unintentionally fragging nuggets or seals just because my F-4 is levelled like mad."
acecombat,3dmbgq,triadorion,2,Fri Jul 17 13:26:47 2015 UTC,"And here I am just struggling with my level 2 F-4 for the Espada challenge...pouring everything into the Gripen really gimped me for like, everything else :P"
acecombat,3dmbgq,Hader102,4,Fri Jul 17 15:08:41 2015 UTC,My Phantom's at 15 and the special F-16s aren't a particular threat.  The vanilla Phantom is a poor choice for this event below Level 10 because its mobility is too poor to evade against tricked out missiles.    If you've got a well leveled F-16 or F-20 variant?  Now's the time to bust that shit out.
acecombat,3dmbgq,triadorion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:25:02 2015 UTC,"My F-16C and F-20 are at level 1 unfortunately. I thought the MiG-29 was going to be usable, but unfortunately no :/"
acecombat,3dmbgq,turboronin,4,Fri Jul 17 13:53:20 2015 UTC,With a level 8 Phantom it is going to be somewhat of an uphill battle. Equip the largest compressor you have and try to go fast at all times and not get caught in the circle-jerking furball where they can easily outmanouver you. High speed jousting passes are probably your best bet at this point. Homing L should also help landing some hits.
acecombat,3dmbgq,LeadFarmer6,2,Fri Jul 17 15:07:54 2015 UTC,Exactly this.  Balls to the wall zoom climbs.  HPAA?  Good luck....I think im just got a equip bombs and just sling them hoping to hit someone.
acecombat,3dmbgq,triadorion,2,Fri Jul 17 16:04:28 2015 UTC,"Ouch, man.  :(  I'm sorry I can't be much more help than that."
acecombat,3dmbgq,FunyaaFireWire,3,Fri Jul 17 14:05:59 2015 UTC,"Golden Falcon   You're kidding right? I'll give you Experimental, Magician and Patriot because they really are good planes but the Gold Falcon is only marginally better than the base F-16C.  Anyways best plane is whatever you have levelled the most, and if you have nothing, F-4E -20-. The rental set isn't too bad either, but you will definitely notice the lack of power compared to people with real sets. Only use that if you're really not willing to waste money on planes you won't use."
acecombat,3dmbgq,triadorion,3,Fri Jul 17 13:27:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the special Mirages you mentioned  are what I dread most of all.  They're not Fighter class but have such good stats and slots I'm just kinda lost how most people are supposed to deal with them."
acecombat,3dmbgq,FunyaaFireWire,2,Fri Jul 17 13:32:55 2015 UTC,"When their plane is faster and can outmaneuver you, there's not much you can do unfortunately. It's mostly just catching them out and trying to get a good joust in."
acecombat,3dmbgq,LeadFarmer6,2,Fri Jul 17 14:00:53 2015 UTC,I havent had a chance to play yet.  I have a level 10 phantom.  I would try to use the new phantom but the lock up time is slow and the range is reduced over my regular phantom.  I wished they would have released that plane about six months ago  so I could level it.
acecombat,3dmbgq,AsterLong,2,Fri Jul 17 13:27:32 2015 UTC,"even my Mami-chan at lvl 4 is enough to wreck havoc, lulz"
acecombat,3dmbgq,triadorion,2,Fri Jul 17 17:38:21 2015 UTC,"I'll save a missle for your false idol.  My F-4 isnt easy prey. :V  More seriously though, I'm not terribly surprised.  The Mami's performance is nuts compared to any vanilla bird that's not leveled like twice as much."
acecombat,3dmbgq,AsterLong,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:47:27 2015 UTC,"still feel like a brick after getting drunk on too much Akula though  i wonder if i'll level it up to lvl 7 to get QAAM to rule this battlefield, haha"
acecombat,3dmbgq,triadorion,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:59:20 2015 UTC,"Ha, yeah. Akula's a hell of a drug.  Maybe, but from what I've seen, just running standard missiles with tons of homing tends to make EVERY missile a QAAM.   It's brutal out there."

acecombat,3dmbgq,triadorion,2,Sat Jul 18 06:11:19 2015 UTC,"Somehow my level 11 Tigershark, almost at level 12, is being OHKOed and out-turned by everything. Even when I'm the host of the room, none of my missiles hit (using Missile Homing L), but everyone else's do, not to mention I've run into an idiotic backward-firing missile lag. TDM is so broken right now, to the point of some Japanese guy flying out the F-16 Stripes at level 10 or higher got over 100K points . My team got no kills that round, and only one guy on the other team got a kill. Including the special aircraft for this TDM really screwed it up. I can barely get a single kill per match with all of these idiotic shenanigans going on."
acecombat,3dmbgq,MobiusGhostOne,2,Fri Jul 17 17:48:27 2015 UTC,"The importance of Armor LL cannot be understated.  Otherwise, I'm not sure what's going on there.  edit:  Also the SP planes allowed in are kind of stupidly overpowered for this.  If you got a Magicien, Experimental, Mami, Patriot, Shin Kazama, or leveled your 20th Anniversary F-4 super fast,  then you have a distinct advantage.  Or disadvantage if not."
acecombat,3dmbgq,triadorion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:50:32 2015 UTC,"I do have it equipped, along with the Stealth Coating S. And the missiles are standard, not HPAA, QAAM, or 4AAMs, so I don't know what's going on either."
acecombat,3dmbgq,MobiusGhostOne,2,Fri Jul 17 17:54:40 2015 UTC,"Ditch the Stealth, and add a compressor or pitch upgrade.   Increase your speed and agility so you have better prayers to dodge.  Also, what's happening is people love to boost their missile homing and damage as high as it can go.  Get it high enough on a Level 10 SP Plane and it'll shred poorly defended vanilla planes.  My level 15 F4 can only sustain 4 missiles with Armor LL.  It's vicious out there."
acecombat,3dmbgq,triadorion,2,Fri Jul 17 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"Special aircraft should have never been allowed in the TDM. I can guarantee anyone who ranks in the top 1000, at least, used a special aircraft. I had a compressor on there, but took it off for my most recent match for the stealth to see if I could survive a single missile; you know the end result."
acecombat,3dmbgq,MobiusGhostOne,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:08:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not intending to use an SP craft, but I recognize my Phantom is a huge and unrealistic investment, so it might as well be.  Unfortunately Stealth Coat doesn't reduce damage taken at all.  Next Gen Armor does but it's so part heavy that a Tigershark cant reasonably hope to equip it and Armor LL.  Just get mobility instead, and if one missile still kills you with Armor LL, ditch it and go full Fragile Speedster.  Might be your only chance to survive: dont get hit at all."
acecombat,3dmbgq,triadorion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:15:07 2015 UTC,"Easier said than done when the all four players on the enemy team target you and only you. Half the match I'm flying my tail off between buildings and under bridges, dodging 4AAMs, QAAMs, and HPAAs, being fired as fast as HCAAs with the reload upgrade, on top of the standard missiles. The other half I'm being killed as soon as I spawn in from a barrage of missiles from below. My team is always full of three derps who just circle jerk in the center of the map and don't even attempt to get a single one of the enemy off my six. Hell, one match my entire team apart from me were nuggets using the stock Harriers with no parts!"
acecombat,3dmbgq,MobiusGhostOne,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:20:43 2015 UTC,"I think part of why they focus you us because they see you in an F-20 and assume you'll be easy pickings because the rental set is a Level 5 Tigershark.  I've noticed flying that is like flying with a target on your back.  And honestly with your luck, I'd just find a different room at that point....  yeesh."
acecombat,3dmbgq,lockspeed-99,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"I'm running the ISAF roundel and nickname, so people can clearly see it's not the stock set with the Reaper emblem. After every match I switch rooms due to either a bunch of useless derps or some guy in a level ten F-20 Kazama or F-16 Stripes. Doesn't help the matter when the only rooms I can find are 1600-1700 MR, when I'm barely over 1450. This tournament is ripe for seal clubbing I tell ya."

On the other hand I've just sortied about 10 times: I've had a few low scoring games but mostly decent.   As usual just punching the afterburner at all times and keeping the loop does the trick: most I've been shot down in a single game was twice. Played several games with no deaths at all. And this is also why I don't like TDM: when everyone is circle jerking with full AB then it boils down to either clubbing the unsuspecting nugget on the opposite team or just hope in a lucky joust. It is tense but not exactly fun.   I wanted to try for the Cipher when it comes the second time around but between the increased competition and the pure futility of this game mode I think I will pass again. Sigh."

acecombat,3dmbgq,TheQuantanamo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:02:16 2015 UTC,"Besides the spectacularly bad idea of allowing SP planes, multiroles are at a definite advantage in this tournament. Most planes being low tiers have shit defense so fighter bonus is  irrelevant. On the other hand with the extra multirole slots you can buff homing/damage to the extreme with the results we have all seen."

In terms of stats, you could easily get a better plane with the SP version of R-101 that's been dropping recently.  Again, I'll participate when Namco either hosts a new tourney or brings back one of the old ones.

acecombat,3dmrbq,PositronCannon,2,Fri Jul 17 15:29:55 2015 UTC,I never bought anything
acecombat,3dmrbq,ComradePutinCCCP1917,2,Fri Jul 17 18:01:04 2015 UTC,I'm glad I'm not the only one. I really hate in-game purchases but I really love ace combat and playing it with good graphics and controls (PSP player mostly here).

Anyways, i'm the kind that doesn't spend at all in fuel (though i bought the campaing, and after completing one of the missions (fourth or fifth i believe), you get 20 stocked fuel, so i'm not sure if that counts. I didn't buy it for the fuel, though."

I mostly buy fuel to free myself from the 3 supplied fuel a day limitation. One 50+10 stocked fuel pack lasts around 2 months for me . I don't regret it but i dont see myself spending hundreds on it every month."
acecombat,3dmrbq,Red-Spacecat,3,Fri Jul 17 16:27:00 2015 UTC,"Never bought it, never will. Only things I bought were the campaign ticket (which I regret, although you did get some complementary fuels) and the set slot expansion (because it's a hassle continuously reformatting aircraft sets).  Main reason I don't pay for fuel is because it's an endless pit. If I decide to pay some now, there's no reason to ever stop. There's always something new you want asap. You need a mentality change to dump cash."
acecombat,3dmrbq,mcziggy,5,Fri Jul 17 15:34:02 2015 UTC,"Do you feel that the set slot expansion is worth it? I'm trying to talk myself out of buying one since I feel like I lose each time I buy something for a F2P game, but the times where I needed to swap sets or needed a particular set to complement the team is pushing me."
acecombat,3dmrbq,turboronin,3,Fri Jul 17 17:45:23 2015 UTC,I folded and bought one eventually. 4 slots is way too low with al the challenges and stuff: I still have to shuffle around with 8 sometimes but it is much more manageable.  It is a good investment.
acecombat,3dmrbq,the_warrior_saint,2,Fri Jul 17 20:02:45 2015 UTC,Agree. I upgraded to 8 and am glad I did.
acecombat,3dmrbq,Red-Spacecat,3,Sat Jul 18 08:15:18 2015 UTC,I feel your sentiments there too. Even if it is an ace combat game I really hate the idea of in-game purchases. I never buy DLC either. I would rather have to pay the upfront cash for a game than be limited to what they give me for free.
acecombat,3dmrbq,Brie_on_toast,3,Fri Jul 17 20:20:32 2015 UTC,"It's bordering on childish only having 4 slots for aircraft. It's also game cripplingly annoying. So when I decided to actually play ACI on a regular basis, this one expansion to 8 slots was inevitable. And even 8 feels claustrophobic. But in actuality, the thing keeping me from expanding again, is the fact that I find navigating the mere 8 slots a nightmare. I never seem to get the feedback I need and have a hard time picking the correct aircraft when the countdown runs, I keep getting lost somehow."
acecombat,3dmrbq,Red-Spacecat,2,Fri Jul 17 20:26:13 2015 UTC,"You can sort Fighter/attacker/multirole/bomber/last used. Not actually too bad.

This means that for Sideways 8 and other pay-to-win free-to-play games, I spend exactly $FREE USD on the game. To be fair, this and a couple of lel mobile time-wasters are the only free-to-play games I actually bother to play.  The sole exceptions are paid MMOs like ARR and the late, great City of Heroes, and THE iDOLM@STER, and the latter is only if I ever decide to sign my soul away to Scamco buy a song or two."

It gives more challenge toi abd saves credits by not adding parts. So right now for instance slot 4 changed to f14a, with no upgrades. Then to the f2, no parts for a Godzilla challenge. And so on. Occasionally I'll only add lightweight homing on the plane because it's cheap. But you save credits and money because you only ever can sortie one plane at a time, keep your 3 desired builds, attack, multi and fighter, and your changing spot for challenges that are challenging if you don't upgrade."

Yes it's clear since both games are produced in Japan, but I like to imagine there's more of a shared trait than just that.   M1/Y13 for example? That's much like.. I can't pin down a direct parallel, but Armored Core is like that also. ""You've got to live and die by your own rules; not for anyone else."" is a very recent phrase from Verdict Day that serves to encapsulate the whole series in general.  ""Living for the fight is all I exist for."" Paraphrasing the final boss of ACVD here, but it sticks. If not for greed in $$$, what else IS there for Ace Combat characters but the pride and joy in dancing with someone you grow to respect as a rival.   Most Ravens from Armored Core have a morally grey approach but most DO find joy in testing opponents. Hell it's likely why there's an Arena subplot running concurrent to the corporate mercenary story-based mission structure. Where you can fight in sanctioned, non-lethal duels with your sweet robutts."
acecombat,3dlqvy,lockspeed-99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:13:03 2015 UTC,Don't quite like VD actually.

I'd really love to play that.
acecombat,3dlqvy,lockspeed-99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:40:32 2015 UTC,"V and VD, hell even 4 and fA excel in personalizing a story. This started with Project Phantasma having an established cast. Although the only characters of any importance were the player and Stinger, with Sumika as an ally.  But I digress, my bad buddy.

acecombat,3dkcav,isual,2,Thu Jul 16 23:36:19 2015 UTC,X amount of sorties in the same room gives a bonus.  I'm guessing it's around 7 or so sorties. I honestly don't know.
acecombat,3dkcav,parryacg,2,Thu Jul 16 23:37:07 2015 UTC,"For me it was five if you're the host of the room and three if you joined the room. I don't know if it's based off of your previous match's performance or not, but those are my findings."
acecombat,3dkcav,MobiusGhostOne,4,Fri Jul 17 00:24:30 2015 UTC,"I think it goes with the room, which is stupid as each player should have had it's own bar instead (otherwise it is going to encourage room hopping even more).   I believe it takes 7 sorties to fill up and then it is a random bonus. From what I gathered from other forums you can get extra drops, extra credits, more research or a special raid."
acecombat,3dkcav,turboronin,2,Fri Jul 17 00:37:24 2015 UTC,"Room hopping doesn't work because you can't see what the bar is unless you play a sortie in that room. Good foresight on their end, tbh.  It's six sorties, btw, not seven."
acecombat,3dkcav,10Sly10,2,Fri Jul 17 01:47:22 2015 UTC,"Still I have seen plenty of people bail after the first sortie if the bar is less than half.   I understand that tying the bar to the room is the only way to give a special raid as a bonus, but if room player retention and faster time to game were the goals having a bar per player would have worked much better.  Also it is like folks at PA are scared to give out actual rewards. 1.5 credit bonus? Couple of extra red boxes (most likely with 1 ticket or 600 credits)? What are these, rewards for ants? At this point in the game they could easily give out 500k credits or 20 research reports or stuff like that. It is still peanuts with the current prices anyway.  Sorry for the rant.

It involves photoetch metal, which adds detail but I've never worked with it before.  It also includes no weapons - you'd have to purchase an extra Hasegawa kit for them.

acecombat,3djnd6,DrinkLiquidSnake,5,Thu Jul 16 20:25:43 2015 UTC,"I enjoy the MiG-1.44, and I've been waiting since launch for it to come to Infinity. As for the few sorties I've flown out since unlocking it, I've been averaging 65K-80K on level 1 alone. It's a fun aircraft to use, plus the fact that the nose looks like a shark and that the aircraft looks like the Pokémon Latios and Latias (two of my favorite Pokémon) makes it cool in my book. Some say that it's a dumbed-down Berkut, which it kind of is, but it's still a worthy aircraft to use. I actually think the better comparison is to the F-15 S/MTD, as the base Cst, price, and level two upgrade cost are all the same, not to mention it has canards and thrust-vectoring nozzles. In a sense, it's the Russian version of the S/MTD, and to an extent the air-to-air of the two experimental/technology demonstrator multi-roles. Anyway, hope this answer suffices, but your final call can only be made when you fly it out yourself."
acecombat,3djnd6,MobiusGhostOne,2,Fri Jul 17 02:42:31 2015 UTC,"Well put. I'm a bitch for the S/MTD, and Eagles in general, but I remember unlocking that green skin for the 1.44 and how much I loved it in AC5.   I've been in the S/MTD since it was added, but if I could choose from the two from the start I think I'd pick the 1.44."
acecombat,3djnd6,VladTheInstaller,3,Fri Jul 17 05:12:02 2015 UTC,"Eh. I've used the 750basecst Su-47 which seems to be objectively better than the MiG-1.44 (from what I can see anyway), and really didn't enjoy using it; It's not as good at killing aircraft as a fighter and no where near as good at A2G as an attacker, so I don't see the point of it at all. The MiG-1.44 has similar weapons but worse balance of stats, base cost and parts slots, so I don't see how that could be better. If it had GPB instead of UGB I'd be more interested."
acecombat,3djnd6,triadorion,2,Thu Jul 16 20:32:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, fair enough. It does seem more geared towards an air to air plane. A LAAM or HVAA would have been beneficial to this guy."
acecombat,3djnd6,VladTheInstaller,4,Thu Jul 16 21:29:20 2015 UTC,"I think what it's really for is to actually give anyone who went that high Russian route an actual Multirole to play with, considering everything else along that route is nothing but Fighters.  It's not exactly an attractive part of the tree if you're looking for versatility, and the Flatpack serves to help alleviate the issue a bit.  Essentially, it's a route specific replacement for the Su-47, from what I'm gathering of it.  Not that the Flatpack is inherently bad, I just don't think it really blows the doors off as a game-changing aircraft.  I just hope to see people actually use it."
acecombat,3djnd6,triadorion,2,Thu Jul 16 21:54:09 2015 UTC,"I hope to see people use it too, just for variety's sake. Also muh slavjet master-race.  I do agree that the Russian jets have been poorly handled by PA; The Su-27 and -33, and Su-37 and -35, are practically identical in most respects when they should have made some attempts to differentiate them. It's bad because I made mistakes in choosing to upgrade my Su-37 and -35 in parallel for tournaments and co-op respectively. Little did I know that the Su-35 with QAAM is just as capable as the Su-37 (if not more-so); I could have saved myself much time and bamcobucks over that. Luckily I haven't fallen into that trap with the new Su-27, since I already have a high level Su-33."
acecombat,3djnd6,parryacg,2,Thu Jul 16 22:18:51 2015 UTC,"I gotta agree.  The Flanker series does very little to differentiate itself from one another; the most you'll really notice is the manueverability difference between the Su-27B and the Su-37.  Speaking of the Su-27B, why the hell is it 400k Credits when the Su-33 is only about 250k?  And why the hell is it that expensive when the Flatpack and Terminator are cheaper too?  It boggles my mind."
acecombat,3djnd6,turboronin,2,Thu Jul 16 23:19:41 2015 UTC,"Locked behind parts, generally speaking.  However, PA dropped the ball with the weapons they gave for the 1.44; 4AAMs, QAAM, UGB. It's literally a 50 less cost Berkut with MiG painted on it which is a damn shame.  That and with the upgrade to 650 cost aircraft capable of level 20, my Fulcrum was nerfed again.  -sighs-"

Level 12?).  The only thing they'll always have over you is SP Weapon damage.   A Lev. 20 MiG-29 will still tear across the sky just as well as a Level 15 YF-23, or a Level 20 X-29."

acecombat,3djnd6,FunyaaFireWire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:17:20 2015 UTC,It should have high stability and good low speed maneuverability if that is the case. My point was that better maneuverability does not overcome being slower and having fewer part slots to work with.

acecombat,3djnd6,FunyaaFireWire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:14:04 2015 UTC,"Nope, but you do lose the missile damage penalty to ground targets, which makes it actually capable of fighting surface ships and heavy ordinance."

acecombat,3djnd6,OmegaEGG,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:02:29 2015 UTC,Fighters do reduced damage to all ground targets regardless of weapon. e.g blind fired HPAA from Fighter will do less damage to stonehenge railgun than one from a multirole.

acecombat,3djdue,the_warrior_saint,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:35:27 2015 UTC,I've dropped about6 20 fuel in 2 days.  Just got the R101 -NC- last night.  Also had both contracts running.  Never thought I'd get it.
acecombat,3dglfo,Ruekuhr,10,Thu Jul 16 02:45:51 2015 UTC,"Got it once myself and I was the only one attacking him. A few thoughts:   I thought it would be much bigger I was hoping it would be an emergency update with dedicated dialogue from Sky Eye I was really hoping for the atomic breath I think you may be able to repel him, but it will probably take the whole room with concentrated firepower As in your standard monster flick I managed to crash into him (not my proudest moment)"
acecombat,3dglfo,turboronin,10,Thu Jul 16 03:15:22 2015 UTC,"This is the most gimmicky bullshit I've ever seen. You can't kill the damn thing, no one announces it (apparently a flock of T-50s are more important than a fucking kaiju), and it does absolutely nothing. No animation when it gets hit, no laserbeams, no clawing/tail-swinging/body movement whatsoever.  Yeah, you get some nifty emblems. So what? That is what we were hyped for?"

acecombat,3dglfo,CTU,2,Fri Jul 17 05:17:15 2015 UTC,Yeah I tried saying this when the update video came out and people downvoted me and said I was being pessimistic. No dip this is stupid gimmicky bullshit. They spent time on this instead of developing the game and most of the ace combat community encouraged this humongous let down and waste of time.  Can we have some fucking standards around here?

acecombat,3dh7dt,FunyaaFireWire,2,Thu Jul 16 10:30:30 2015 UTC,Even with the Enhancement L part? I was hoping that would break the barrier.
acecombat,3dh7dt,Red-Spacecat,2,Thu Jul 16 10:38:09 2015 UTC,It requires stacking both missle kit L and missle warhead L.
acecombat,3dh7dt,FunyaaFireWire,2,Thu Jul 16 10:42:12 2015 UTC,Will try.
acecombat,3dh7dt,Red-Spacecat,2,Thu Jul 16 10:43:05 2015 UTC,Bomb enhancement kit L + hardpoint L + Explosive L + Lvl5 SFFS    stupidly high reload speed + extra high damage

acecombat,3dh7dt,Ikillu4ever93,2,Thu Jul 16 11:35:37 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that level 5 6aam on a 750+cst plane with Missile Enhancement Kit L will be enough to one-shot orange air targets on hard maps.
acecombat,3dh7dt,nicotoy,2,Thu Jul 16 11:00:46 2015 UTC,"It has to be a Missile Enhancement Kit (SPW) L then, because the other one only works for standard missiles."

LASM feels the same but I didn't fling it enough times to see if it still randomly crashes into the water.  I did get 2 extra slots for Gold Falcon and 1 for F-16F that I don't recall having prior to maintenance. There's a good chance that I lost track of it while binging though but I may as well throw it out there."

acecombat,3dgtzq,FunyaaFireWire,2,Thu Jul 16 05:41:18 2015 UTC,I don't feel like a 4AGM Strike Eagle will ever need to be retired. It's about time I leveled it past 10.
acecombat,3dgtzq,triadorion,3,Thu Jul 16 08:17:58 2015 UTC,"4AGMultiroles leave a lot to be desired, they're not good at clearing anything but yellows. Though with reload parts, the frequency of spam more than makes up for it on stages with lots of ground targets. Strike Eagle's 4AGMs kinda suck because you don't 2 shot AD tanks without parts but that's not a huge deal breaker, you can 4agm > missle instead."
acecombat,3dgtzq,curryp70,3,Thu Jul 16 09:17:47 2015 UTC,Never stopped me from doing well in the F-35 with 4AGMs.  It's about target management and timing your 4AGMs.  And knowing how many you need to kill orange and red targets; or going for them with your normal missiles and use your 4AGMs for mopping up.  They're great once you learn how to effectively balance between spamming them and surgically striking big targets with them.
acecombat,3dgtzq,DrinkLiquidSnake,2,Thu Jul 16 10:43:24 2015 UTC,i agree.  i do pretty well with my f-35

acecombat,3dgz11,DrinkLiquidSnake,2,Thu Jul 16 17:07:25 2015 UTC,"FAEB no. SFFS yes. FAEB gets no effective damage bonuses so its better to slap on only reload L for the increased capacity. SFFS gets a noticeable damage boost, to insane amounts if you stack both power (I think my FB-22 one shot AD Tanks with only one small bomblette).   apparently the bomb parts don't have reduced effectiveness like missle parts."

acecombat,3dd75o,lockspeed-99,9,Wed Jul 15 10:16:01 2015 UTC,"The following were confirmed through PROJECT_ACES on Twitter.   In the hangar, you will now see each aircraft's maximum possible level in addition to its current level. Special weapon detail screens will be slightly modified. You know how they highlighted compatible aircraft you owned, even if it didn't have access to that special weapon? Not anymore. Only aircraft that can immediately equip that special weapon will be highlighted. Team Deathmatch MR is splitting into two. There will be one MR for Team Deathmatch, and one MR for Naval Team Deathmatch. (Both MRs will be reset to 1500 for everyone when the game comes online.) You can now set a nickname for each aircraft set. If you repeatedly sortie in one room without leaving it, you will eventually earn a random bonus of some kind. Details are not currently available. If you have not logged into the game for a while, you will earn a unique ""Welcome Back"" (my words, not Project Aces's) Daily Login Bonus upon your return to the game.   If you have not logged in for 10-19 days, your Welcome Back Daily Login Bonus is as follows: 5,000 credits / 10,000 credits / 2 Stocked Fuel / 3 Parts Research Reports / 5 Aircraft Research Reports If you have not logged in for 20-29 days, your Welcome Back Daily Login Bonus is as follows: 3 Stocked Fuel / 20,000 credits / 3 Elite Mercenary Contracts / 3 Stocked Fuel / 50,000 credits If you have not logged in for 30-59 days, your Welcome Back Daily Login Bonus is as follows: 3 Stocked Fuel / 50,000 Credits / 5 Elite Mercenary Contracts / 3 Stocked Fuel / 3 Stocked Fuel / 100,000 credits If you have not logged in for 60+ days, your Welcome Back Daily Login Bonus is as follows: 400 Special Supply Tickets / 100,000 credits / 100 Aircraft Research Reports / 150,000 credits / 5 Stocked Fuel / 200,000 credits  Prices for aircraft and parts, mostly earlier in the tree, will be re-adjusted (mostly to help new players).

Made worse, recently fuel's been on sale during events, so people have been splurging more.  I think it's less you, and more everyone else."

acecombat,3d772c,Red-Spacecat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:09:00 2015 UTC,"It's TDM though, so there should be a little less competition. Also shitplanes only and the tournament is short.  But I'm sure that top 200 will still be hard."
acecombat,3d772c,turboronin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:50:43 2015 UTC,Whales will upgrade the best low tier plane to the absolute max and throw Kuwaiti levels of fuel at it. These tournaments are not for the F2P player (me).
acecombat,3d772c,Red-Spacecat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:03:36 2015 UTC,If you want top prizes I agree. But this one might be easier for top 1000-3000.
acecombat,3d772c,turboronin,4,Tue Jul 14 12:12:17 2015 UTC,"Its not just you. You used to be able to be very close to top 3000 on solely supply fuel. Now its more likely you'll end up around top 5000. Top 1000 is a lot rougher too.  It seems the top end of whales spend more too.  Also keep in mind, for some reason, hard missions reward less ranking points than normal missions."
acecombat,3d772c,FunyaaFireWire,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:10:01 2015 UTC,I guess they really want those SP level cap forms. Genius move from Bamco to increase competition while recycling content and tournaments.
acecombat,3d772c,turboronin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:02:06 2015 UTC,"Its not just this tournament, the last few have been the same. It feels as if the top 3000 range moved from mostly supply fuel to supply fuel + all free stocked fuel. Its still easily achievable I suppose."
acecombat,3d772c,FunyaaFireWire,2,Tue Jul 14 05:02:29 2015 UTC,"I think it's more because of what the tournaments are. We're talking about tournaments that took place around Infinity's 1st anniversary (featuring Mobius of all things) and Ace Combat's 20th anniversary (featuring the special aircraft of Infinity's protagonists).  ...I just realized how backwards the above looks xD  But there's more people playing right now than during the rest of 2015, so there's going to be a lot more competition. TDM will have more competition just because everyone plays TDM, but after that it should start to slow down unless we get major rewards again."
acecombat,3d772c,10Sly10,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:01:54 2015 UTC,TDM will have less competition just because not everyone plays TDM   Less. TDM has always had less competition.
acecombat,3d772c,FunyaaFireWire,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:27:39 2015 UTC,Really? Maybe I just didn't play enough to notice.
acecombat,3d772c,10Sly10,2,Tue Jul 14 14:41:14 2015 UTC,TDM is a bit strange on ranking points because your performance in matches has more of an influence in the amount of points you get so somebody who consistently does poorly can end up with the same ranking as somebody who does well and spent half the fuel.  The bottom rankings are much lower though. Last TDM you can crack top 10000 by only playing a couple of sorties.
acecombat,3d6nlu,ArkDax,3,Mon Jul 13 23:01:24 2015 UTC,"Since you've been playing for a while, this is much easier for you to do than new players:   Lock down all research by allowing all items to be fully researched without buying them. This allows you to get credit reimbursements based on the amount of research that couldn't be done, and your rank (the military ranks). Complete matches with S ranks and a victory. S ranks gives you the highest mission completion reward. Winning will double that reward via Team Victory bonus.  Play with fewer players. Fewer players means more points for everyone. Play Moscow. It's the easiest mission with a great number of targets that can be cleared with 4 players. It's why this map is so popular. Use the part that increases points of rescues. As an attacker, you'll be getting a lot of rescue bonuses from the antiaircraft targets. The points are proportionate to the value of the target, with AD tanks in Moscow giving the most. The part is really effective in Avalon because just about everything in this map targets aircraft. Stocked fuel provides research to the plane you flew. If the plane's research is locked down, you get an additional credit reimbursement for it. Mercenary Contracts double your credit reward minus credit reimbursements.  Plant Investment contracts add an additional research, which can also be converted to an additional credit reimbursement.   Use these contracts when force sorties are active and you're going to have a marathon.   Force sortie raids 2 and up."
acecombat,3d6nlu,yphan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:23:02 2015 UTC,"That works for me. I guess that's why I see Duck360 always doing Moscow with 4 players. No bots, or bots included?"

acecombat,3d6nlu,PositronCannon,2,Tue Jul 14 15:24:33 2015 UTC,"While i've never tried it and i don't know much about Infinity's mechanics, i'll be saying this as a placeholder of sorts until someone more well-versed shows up with better explanation/advice: If you ""lock"" your research (as in, complete research in whatever you are doing and then do not open any other item for research), you get bonus credits as a compensation for the lack of research. I forgot exactly how much, but i remember it was a substantial amount; double, perhaps. But i'll have to check it.  Anyways, since you're halfway through the R101 and the bloody Night Raven, it might take some time for you to be able to lock your research."
acecombat,3d4wr1,Suiraza,8,Mon Jul 13 15:32:36 2015 UTC,"Campaign isn't worth it unless you buy the ticket pass. The few missions you get aren't really too great (4 lame tutorial missions + 3 semi-decent ones + 1 good mission.. Hard sell) Try not to use stocked fuel unless it's a raid or you're burning fuel for a tournament. Triple use stocked fuel if its a level 2 raid or higher. If you're burning for a tournament, make sure to use a plant and elite contract to maximize your rewards if you can. At the end of matches, research gets assigned randomly to anything that is able to be researched. If you want to progress faster, 'focus' your research by not buying stuff you don't need so they get researched faster. If those research points can't get put anywhere, they turn into credits at a pretty decent rate. (You can get ~1m or more / week using these bonuses) Try to stick to rooms near your MR for a more enjoyable experience and stay out of any rooms hosted by 1700+ that are classified as 'beginners welcome'. Those are full of scummy players trying to earn an easy win by playing with worse players.   I think that covers all the general info you need to know. There is a patch later today and the game will be down for 2 days or so, so don't panic"

acecombat,3d4wr1,PositronCannon,4,Mon Jul 13 15:53:54 2015 UTC,"It may actually be worth it to play the first 5 campaign missions down the line, though. You have to spend 200K + 300K + 400K = 900K credits for missions 3-5, and get 20 stocked fuel and 100K credits in return. Using that fuel wisely, it's possible to make up the loss and get a good amount of research on top of it. But I wouldn't recommend it until a player has settled with a couple of capable plane sets and has no immediate need for the credits.  Though really, if you enjoy the game, I'd say buying the campaign ticket is pretty fair. That and the rookie/elite packs are the only things that I don't consider to be complete scams in terms of pricing (unlike, say, fuel)."

Of course there were still the occasional good matches, bust most of the time my MR did drop. One doesn't need to abstain from engaging targets to be the least-scoring player in the room, i believe.  Continuing not-interesting story: But then i decided to fly the F-5 and decided to lvl it and my MR stopped dropping. In fact, it started rising again and at that point i said ""you know what, i don't even care about my MR"" and here i am back at 1710-something.

acecombat,3d0dm6,Gustavo13,2,Sun Jul 12 18:19:21 2015 UTC,"Ace Combat doesn't simulate turbulence or winds too well, so this post would be better over in r/flying.  However, normally, an unsettled patch of air in otherwise clear skies would shake the aircraft around a bit, but wouldn't jostle it further (provided that you take the necessary steps to avoid it). I'd say that's a physics error on their part, maybe they're purposely making it harder."
acecombat,3d0dm6,Throwaway_of_pain,4,Sun Jul 12 17:42:51 2015 UTC,But there's no turbulence in ACI. Unless you're talking about near-Stall shaking.

acecombat,3cugpc,VladTheInstaller,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:13:04 2015 UTC,"It became multirole pretty much entirely because ACI doesn't have a Jammer/EWAR category.

acecombat,3cugpc,PAK-FAace,6,Sat Jul 11 17:16:31 2015 UTC,"Here's a mirror as Bamco has made their version private  What I'm concerned about is how can they differentiate the Su-27 from all the other Russian fighters based on the same chassis?  The Su-37 and Su-35 are extremely similar at high levels with the Su-37 edging out on speed and defence. The Su-33 is really a poor-man's version of them with mediocre special weapons.  Because the Su-27 and MiG-29A are contemporaries they will probably be side by side, but how will they be different as they're both high-maneuverability fighters? The MiG-31 was different due to it's high speed and average maneuverability."

acecombat,3cunx5,lockspeed-99,4,Sat Jul 11 00:18:04 2015 UTC,"But I know they bloody nerfed the SAAM without the Amplifier   No they don't. You really don't need the Amplifier and the SAAM's high air-to-air and SPW multiplier means it's an absolute killer, even in low-Cst aircrafts.  Currently, the highest Cst aircrafts equipped with SAAMs are YF-23s and ATD-0s, and a level 5 SAAM with either of those aircrafts will two-hit anything short of Butterfly Master's UAVs. Stick a Homing M/L and it will home in even outside the circle. What's not to love?  As for ACI ECMs, I'll quote Team Fortress 2 here:   ""Now don't get me wrong, YOU don't need back-up, but please dig deep in that war torn black pea of a heart and feel pity for the rest of your good-for-nothing team."""

With HCAAs, you can just sweep your plane across an entire group of enemies and kill everything. The only thing I have to complain about this weapon is the range, and speed. I have to put propulsion parts on it to get it to hit, and those damn 6AAMer's keep stealing my kills.   Least Favorite: ESM. Like what the fuck, bamco?"

acecombat,3cunx5,FunyaaFireWire,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:02:00 2015 UTC,There isn't a difference. They have an effective range of far beyond most practical uses. The only case that barely cuts it is firing at 6000m against an escaping Mig-31 at max speed down the valley in WBA with L1 HVAA.

A solid, well performing special weapon that's not disgustingly broke tier and requires some skill to use for its maximum effectiveness.  It's won me a lot of rounds in my F-35.    Honorable Mention goes to the HCAA after its improvement, and on my YF-23, I love performing Unlimited Missile Works.  Least Favorite that's not ESM:  6AAMs.  Not because they're bad.  But they're utterly brainless to use and really bloody hard to counter.   I kinda feel the same way about SFFS and the FAEB now too, but 6AAM spammers get my hackles up faster than anything else and will quickly make me not respect you if you abuse them.  For my own personal use, other than 6AAMs, I'm not a terribly huge fan of the SOD in Infinity.  It feels way too weak."
acecombat,3cunx5,PositronCannon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:24:08 2015 UTC,"I use 6AAMs on my Typhoon but only use parts to buff standard missiles, am I okay? :( Honestly, I use them cause I got them to lv5 back in the day and they're okay for grabbing some orange kills here and there, as well as big slow moving planes, but I really don't like the idea of relying mainly on SPWs, especially for A2A. I've considered switching to HCAA or HVAA a few times by now, but they wouldn't be much more useful to me either, everything needs some sort of buff to be useful and I'd much rather enhance my standards as much as possible."

I may be a touch bitter with a good mix of opinionated and arrogant.   :V  You also get props for running the Typhoon.

Then again the F-16C does have the QAAMs which would be fantastic in a TDM game, but the F-20A has a cheaper level-up cost and a higher starting CST.

Plus you can't pay attention the radar (And where missiles are coming from) while aiming with guns at the same time."

acecombat,3cska3,jwyche008,2,Fri Jul 10 18:28:21 2015 UTC,All of these things are level one for me but F-16C -Mami- has the biggest cost. Should I focus on getting that up?  Edit: Shit actually we can use the F-4E we just got and that thing has a ton of capacity! Should I use that instead?
acecombat,3cska3,triadorion,2,Fri Jul 10 19:00:54 2015 UTC,"You can.  It costs quite a bit to upgrade too though, considering its CST is much higher than the baseline Phantom.  I suspect most people will be using it if they don't have a reliable low tier.  Edit:  Also the F-16 Mami is a Fighter, so that gains better benefit to its SP Weapons, and it has a better selection of A2A weapons instead of only the HPAA.  Worth keeping in mind."

I don't know if others exist.   My argument to them would be that it sounds awesome, and the differentiation between jets makes business sense as it would drive customers to buy new planes to experience the different feel of the cockpit with correct warnings, especially considering the reaction of people to the HUD and warnings of the R-101."

But besides that, not talking about this game at all is the best way to make sure it never changes. So, while the possibility is very slim at best, if PA is smart and realises the western market is still within reach, they'll value our input.  But I get what your saying, and I feel the same way too. I rant, but mainly to get stuff off my chest, not really because I believe PA will alter their game to according my suggestions (the only way to get their attention is to stop giving them money).

acecombat,3cp9ct,the_warrior_saint,3,Fri Jul 10 08:12:10 2015 UTC,"I can't really stand those types of throttle systems when it comes to fighter type stuff, to be honest.  I loved it for the helmsman in Artemis, but that's about it. It worked really in Freespace 2, but generally just cuz I ended up matching the speed of enemy ships then using the afterburner or the brake to adjust, without changing the throttle.  That said, I'd actually be glad if they implemented this as an option in AC, I love when there are more options to make more players happy. But I'd be upset if it became mandatory. Unless it was revolutionarily balanced and implemented, I doubt I would enjoy AC as much.  This is all just my opinion by the way. I'm not trying to knock it as objectively bad, just that I've never really clicked with it."
acecombat,3cp9ct,BlindProphet_413,2,Fri Jul 10 01:02:47 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of Wing Over 2/Pilot ni Narou. Your throttle =/= speed, and so there's time lag between throttle and speed increasing (so called throttle response).   Dogfighting with such thing actually is rather intense since you need to have a bit of forethought put into it. Plus, since you really only are able to carry 6-8 missiles at a time, you really need to be able to strategize."

acecombat,3cp9ct,Red-Spacecat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:48:17 2015 UTC,Sounds a lot like the system in Over-G Fighters. They had that exact system; throttle would go from 70% (idle) to 100 (100-130 was afterburner) and was adjusted by the bumpers.

Combine it with the contents of the gold box, and you got yourself a potentially vicious drop scenario.  You want to know how I came up with this number? Way back when FF14 hit 2.2, Squeenix released a little thing called Atma which dropped from FATEs so long as you had a relic weapon Zenith equipped. You know what the drop was? 2.5% give or take (most likely around 2.35% or lower).  There were people that hadn't gotten an Atma for weeks, others got it within minutes. This is the same case as ACI.

acecombat,3cdty8,OfficalWerewolf,5,Tue Jul 7 03:25:30 2015 UTC,"It's possible that they have other, older carriers yet. However, as we know from Zero, these carriers are of the newest in their fleet. This is certainly a huge loss to OSEA's navy and overall military strength. Both sides faced massive loss in what was definitely a very bloody conflict. Good thing Razgriz rose again afterall."
acecombat,3cdty8,Jay467,6,Tue Jul 7 05:07:32 2015 UTC,"Even after the war, I can only imagine the losses in both life and cash must have been enormous. Two nuclear powered subs lost by Yuktobania, four carriers lost by Osea, not to mention hundreds of planes, dozens of smaller ships, hundreds of tanks and tens of thousands of men. The ending of AC5 really hides the fact that even with the war over, both countries are in serious trouble."
acecombat,3cdty8,Jay467,4,Tue Jul 7 05:22:02 2015 UTC,"Truth be told, I can't imagine too many countries would be willing to attack nations as powerful as OSEA or Yuktobania, even when wounded. But I agree, both countries' defenses are hurting pretty bad after such a conflict."
acecombat,3cdty8,10Sly10,5,Tue Jul 7 05:32:07 2015 UTC,"That is true. Belka is a non-factor, Usea is in Civil War, Anea is too peaceful and the countries there lack the needed force projection. They're safe. Though they're likely devastated economically. Both countries suffered bombing of their cities and losses of merchant shipping. Though it could be for the better. I assume most of the AC nations have nuclear weapons, so losing the Arkbird could have been a major destabilizer, with it's ability to shoot down ICBM's. It's destruction went a long way to maintaining the status qou."
acecombat,3cdty8,10Sly10,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:43:10 2015 UTC,"It's safe to assume that Strangereal has no nuclear weapons after Belka's self-detonation. That world is obsessed with laser weaponry as it is, and given the events we saw in AC3, they don't need nukes to cause that kind of destruction on that kind of scale."
acecombat,3cdty8,10Sly10,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:47:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think they actually would dismantle all of them. Even in the game against a test super weapons are only tactical level- the largest non nuclear super weapon was the burst missiles of Scinfaxi. I'm sure they still have their nukes, they just vowed to never touch them. After all, V2 was a MIRV. Stonehenge and Megalith were only effective against air targets, Chandelier could be intercepted, the arkbird was designed to shoot down missiles, etc. I'm not sure about AC3 though, never played it, but I know it took place far in the future, so at that point technology likely changed to make nukes obsolete. But prior to and directly after the Belkan War in sure there were plenty of nukes around."
acecombat,3cdty8,lockspeed-99,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:17:38 2015 UTC,"Megalith wasn't effective against air targets; it was purely an asteroid artillery platform to cause mass destruction on the ground.  The fact that Chandelier could be intercepted doesn't matter, so can any nuclear weapon if it has a vulnerability.  The Arkbird was not designed to shoot down missiles. It was designed to clean up the atmosphere. It was then outfitted with a laser weapon on the bottom of the craft, which could attack anything. The player uses it in Northern Wings to destroy the Yuktobanian fleet, and the Belkans use it against your aircraft in White Bird Part II.  Prior to the Belkan War, I'm sure there were nukes. But given the advancement of so many alternate weapon designs, I doubt they were around afterward."
acecombat,3cdty8,10Sly10,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:36:05 2015 UTC,"That was my mistake. Good thing Megalith was taken care of. It really did posses the power to turn the entire continent into one giant wasteland.   Chandelier's projectiles also did have a relatively low yield. If they had been nuclear the entire city of Gracemeria would have been flattened with a single hit. And I always thought that the WMD's that you take out in AC6 were nuclear in nature. I may be wrong though.   The arkbird itself wasn't designed for that, but the laser that was attached to it was. It just also happened to have capability against many other targets. Its original purpose was to shoot down Yuktobanian ICBM's during the Cold War, and it retained that function afterwards.   And the SOLG was designed with nuclear munitions in mind. I don't doubt that nuclear weapons took a back seat following the development of new weapons, but I'm confident that they were never fazed out, just relegated to last resort weapons, rather then tactical ones."
acecombat,3cdty8,ZeBastard,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:43:33 2015 UTC,"Its original purpose was to shoot down Yuktobanian ICBM's during the Cold War, and it retained that function afterwards.   I want your source on that, because the Arkbird was only designed with a laser on the top for clearing space debris (which is mentioned in a GAZE newspaper on the AC5 website, since the Arkbird was the host of a summit in 2008). The laser on the bottom wasn't installed until Mission 6, White Bird Part I, where you help them attach the thing in the first place.   And the SOLG was designed with nuclear munitions in mind.   It was designed with MIRV in mind. They didn't mention any kind of warhead, it could have been anything."
acecombat,3cdty8,10Sly10,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:46:51 2015 UTC,"""The Arkbird (アークバード Ākubādo) is a spacecraft built by the Osean Federation and the Union of Yuktobanian Republics] during the Cold War as an ICBM and asteroid interception weapon. It was the replacement of the Stonehenge built in Usea.""  This is from the wiki. You're not wrong, it was built as a multi-mission platform. It was designed during the Cold War, but not completed until after Ulysses. It wasn't until the Circum-Pacific War that the laser that it had been designed for was actually mounted.   And yes, the SOLG could fire any type of ammunition, but when the grey men seized it, they did so with the intent to use V2. Like I said, you're not wrong. Many of these super weapons could use both nuclear and conventional rounds. And the Cold War left hundreds if not thousands of nuclear weapons behind."
acecombat,3cdty8,Fatocaster,3,Wed Jul 8 18:55:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about Osea, but the Yuktobanians, if anything, are great shipbuilders as evidenced by their subs and their massive fleets. I won't doubt they'll rise again.  And a country as large as Osea, I believe they can mobilize their economic might just as easily."
acecombat,3cdty8,10Sly10,2,Tue Jul 7 08:57:29 2015 UTC,"Of course. Though it's pretty clear that the administrations in charge of both nations wouldn't allow a military build up, even to pre-war levels. A sentiment I don't agree with, but the message of AC5 always had been one of peace. Four carriers is several billon dollars worth of military spending- but then again, this is Strangereal, where half of the world can build super weapons with budgets equivalent to the GDP of many nations. They'll be fine."
acecombat,3cd1d8,Grifkilla51,6,Mon Jul 6 23:28:51 2015 UTC,"The story is great, but a theme arises in some of them. Enemy invades your country to the extreme (and the first mission you have is to defend your only airbase against bombers with minimal escort). Your reputation builds as your country fights back all the way to the point where you liberate your captial. There's also some counterinvasion involved."
acecombat,3cd1d8,Throwaway_of_pain,3,Tue Jul 7 01:31:51 2015 UTC,Don't forget a gigantic weapon that throws out all pretenses of sensical military weapon design.
acecombat,3cd1d8,10Sly10,4,Wed Jul 8 11:49:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah most AC story lines are great! I started all the way from AC2. Personally I'd start with 5 which had a really good story, but you can't really go wrong with any."
acecombat,3cd1d8,williamkomba,4,Mon Jul 6 23:34:14 2015 UTC,"Is 6 good? It seems that 0,1,2,3,4,5 are PS2 only which would be hard to find. Is 6 a good starting place story wise?"
acecombat,3cd1d8,FurryFoxJetPilot,6,Mon Jul 6 23:46:04 2015 UTC,"Many people would say that 6 had a weak and corny storyline. I have only played the demo but I have to say who cares about the storyline. 6 has the best gameplay out of any other title in the series. The massive battles taking place, the perfect controls, and amazing graphics completely blow away every other Ace Combat and make them seem like a joke. If you don't care about the story then definitely start with 6. No other games in the series come close to its gameplay"
acecombat,3cd1d8,parryacg,3,Mon Jul 6 23:58:59 2015 UTC,"Nah, AC0, 4 and 5 are easy to find. If you can, you're better off emulating Ace Combat 3 JP with the english patch, and I'm not so sure about Ace Combat 2 or Air Combat."
acecombat,3cd1d8,williamkomba,2,Mon Jul 6 23:59:03 2015 UTC,Yeah in terms of gameplay 6 was good but IMO I found the story line alot cheesier than usual
acecombat,3cd1d8,Muf4sa,3,Tue Jul 7 00:01:15 2015 UTC,"Another thing, are the games standalone or is there a overarching story?"
acecombat,3cd1d8,ComradePutinCCCP1917,3,Tue Jul 7 00:24:42 2015 UTC,Although the main storyline takes place in the same universe the games are not necessarily dependent of each other. The games can be played in any order you wish and you can still catch up.
acecombat,3cd1d8,Throwaway_of_pain,4,Tue Jul 7 01:55:26 2015 UTC,there's still a lot of references in Zero that you wouldn't get if you haven't played 5.
acecombat,3cd1d8,10Sly10,4,Tue Jul 7 06:06:54 2015 UTC,"It's definitely an overarching story. 2, 04, 5, and 6 are all about the legacy of an earth threatening asteroid. 0 is a prequel to 5."
acecombat,3cd1d8,yphan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:29:51 2015 UTC,"2 and 5 have nothing to do with Ulysses. Legacy tied into it a little and explained some things, but only 04 and 6 relate to Ulysses."
acecombat,3cd1d8,ComradePutinCCCP1917,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:50:24 2015 UTC,"The plots in most of the games are okay. They tried a complicated plot in 5, which I think is one of the weakest of the home console series. It does do a good job of sending shivers down your spine - you know that feeling when you hear or see something amazing? Anyway, I much prefer their simpler plots in 4 and Zero.  But really, you play this series for the game play, not the story. 6 is great for the scale of the battles; the missions dwarf Battlefield maps. 5 has good variety of missions. Zero has a morality system of sorts that slightly alters your next mission, giving it some replayability. In 4, the story and missions build up to key moments: some missions logically lead to the next and pay it off with a large scale mission, and the story builds up to the ultimate fight against the enemy ace."
acecombat,3cd1d8,yphan,2,Tue Jul 7 01:58:56 2015 UTC,"I play this series for the story, not the gameplay (let's be honest, AC4's flight mechanics are crap).  AC4 / AC5 / AC0 have the best stories. AC3 is being translated by project nemo and has the most complete story in the series.  AC6 is really good. But its story is as cheesy as its lines...  ACAH is crap. You remove all the fun from the past games, buff every plane, and change the plot to a classic US vs ex-soviet terrorists.  ACI is good. You have the fun from the past games with an OK story."

acecombat,3ccvux,LOTO-12,8,Mon Jul 6 23:28:00 2015 UTC,"Guts is something I'd generally agree with, but if we're going to take AC:AH out of the picture for being the low hanging fruit, I'd have to go with Shamrock.  And for me, it's not even for the dancing with the angels nonsense.  It's more about how petulant he was about not following orders when Ghost Eye and High Command gave you the order to retreat during a fight with Strigon Squadron.  You know, the part where Stupidity is the Only Option and you have to shoot down Strigon Squadron to end the mission all the while being nagged at to leave the airspace at once.  And then he's still petulant in the mission afterward when we finally learn why the retreat order was sounded.  And that it was a damn good one but it still wasn't good enough, apparently.  When Shamrock took a verbal shot at Ghost Eye, I about yelled at my screen the first time saying ""You're a soldier, you dumbass, you don't get to say that shit and you of all people know what's at stake there!""  I would have been willing to forgive him for the heat-of-the-moment anger with Strigon Squadron had he actually been apologetic and admitted he and Talisman really screwed up in the previous mission and took responsibility for it.  But nope.  Lost a lot of respect for Shamrock.  He's a decent AI partner, but that whole arc made him my most disliked wingman outside of Guts."
acecombat,3ccvux,triadorion,5,Mon Jul 6 23:22:36 2015 UTC,"The whiny English voice acting doesn't do it any favors. In the Japanese version, he's voiced by Koyama Rikiya, who did Jack Bauer's Japanese dub. That and the generally better acting quality lessened much of the impact (if anything, his outburst was actually rather cool)."
acecombat,3ccvux,lockspeed-99,4,Tue Jul 7 00:06:33 2015 UTC,"Not having heard the Japanese audio, I couldn't factor that in.  But you're definitely right about the English VA being too whiny for that part.  I'm not sure if it was the actor or the direction more for that, but either way it really left me sour towards Shamrock, who I had otherwise found inoffensive, up to that point."

acecombat,3ccvux,lockspeed-99,5,Tue Jul 7 08:27:53 2015 UTC,"I actually found Guts to be an authentic Hispanic man. He reminds me a lot of a friend my father has, from the Dominican Republic, cracking jokes even when they sound forced.   Or I can even draw the comparison to my Mexican uncle, who similarly banters in a similar, but slightly annoying fashion. Sometimes it can be very funny."
acecombat,3ccvux,DrinkLiquidSnake,8,Tue Jul 7 00:20:11 2015 UTC,"Well, since I don't count Ace Combat: Call of Duty as part of the series, I'm gonna have to give the award to Razgriz 2-4. I suspect it's because Sea of Chaos is the best way to fill up kill bars for planes. Holy shit they do not shut up on that mission.  Pixy keeps it in check, PJ's not talking your ear off (though he could shut up at B7R vs. wizard/sorcerer/gault, less chat more fox two plz), and... I never really got into AC6 so I can't comment on Shamrock."
acecombat,3ccvux,Thexare,8,Mon Jul 6 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"Shamrock's a fucking bitch that doesn't cover you (which completely violates wingman code), even when ordered.

I guess she doesn't want to get her hands dirty."

They constantly preach about how war is horrible and must be stopped while they are actively killing hundreds of pilots in fierce combat. And then when they find out Belkans are puppeteering the world into war, they show full support in fighting the terrorists. It's an irritating moral grey area that pisses me off."

acecombat,3ccvux,parryacg,4,Tue Jul 7 00:01:34 2015 UTC,"I'll second this. Edge (OK, Nagase, really) has maybe two lines in eight missions where she says anything useful or competent. Otherwise she just comes off as high-maintenance, overly emotional, and unprofessional."

Also, Jesus man, so much hate for AH when a lot of the other AC games are ""man this is so derative of better Tomino gundam anime, I mean if I wanted to watch people say 'muh peace, muh war,' when piloting expensive death machines at least I can watch Gundam (or a Gen Urobuchi show like Gargantia which is actually honest.)"
acecombat,3ccvux,Ryand-Smith,5,Tue Jul 7 03:03:39 2015 UTC,"Where do I say I hate women?  Calling the Bomber Girl a 'bimbo'?  Oh please, I get told I have 'bad teeth' and that I'm a 'Tea Sipper' for being English, but I'm gonna ring the alarm bells for it.  Also, being realistic does not always make for good characterization.  I don't like Guts because he contributes nothing, either tactically or humorously to the Radio Chatter.  Part of what I enjoyed about early AC Radio Chatter, on the tactical side, we have stuff along the lines of:  ""Sanatise my 6 O'Clock, Omega 11!""  and more humorously we have  ""Radio failure!""  (Over the radio.)  It's better here, because the former is actually something you'd hear over Comm traffic, while the latter is just a small quip to add a bit of flavour.  Both attempts by Guts just don't click.  In AC5's case, the banter between Chopper and Thunderhead adds a few laughs as well.  Another thing that helps the chatter in these games is the somewhat 'light-heartedness'.  But everyone in AC:AH is trying to be serious, which is why none of them are as engaging as your wingmen from AC5.  Also, I don't watch Gundam, so I don't know."

The thing is, AC is VERY anime influnenced, like for me, its mainly using tropes that other series have long established, and using the word bimbo for women is pretty derogation my friend.  Also, the AC5 wingmen (doubly so in Infinity since its a weird psudo remake of it), are just... I don't know, its mostly forced humor. I mean its hard to be light hearted when we are fighting genocidal maniacs or ultranationalist not Nazis I guess."

But then again, you do have a point; furthermore, no AC game i'm aware of ever let you look at the pilot's hands or feet.

acecombat,3c6gg8,yphan,3,Sun Jul 5 09:17:49 2015 UTC,"That last one is the main one, really. Blocking off research and burning a lot of fuel while using both contract types is a great way of getting money fast. Especially when you come across a emergency sortie on a weekend."
acecombat,3c6gg8,VladTheInstaller,3,Sun Jul 5 09:31:03 2015 UTC,That last one is new to me. Didn't know it worked that way.
acecombat,3c6gg8,yphan,3,Sun Jul 5 14:12:43 2015 UTC,"Yep. You get credits per research that can't be performed. It's possible to get up to 5 items researched. if none of them can be performed, you get 5 times your credit reimbursement."
acecombat,3c6gg8,huepaperplane98,2,Sun Jul 5 18:01:07 2015 UTC,"If it isn't much of a hassle, could you please elaborate a bit more on the first one? i'm especially interested on it since i've recently opened lots of items since i want to get the Su-33 and F-22 in time to get their AC skins. I'm currently researching the two parts that lead to the Raptor, the two parts that lead to the Flanker, and other two parts that opened togheter with the ones leading to the Flanker, plus some planes i was lvl'ing."
acecombat,3c6gg8,yphan,2,Sun Jul 5 15:32:25 2015 UTC,"Well, it researches one additional item so long as the contract is active.  By default, the game researches two random items that are open. The contract will guarantee a third item gets researched.   You can get two more items researched for a total of five items: winning a match grants you research to one additional item, and using stocked fuel grants research on the plane you flew."
acecombat,3c6gg8,huepaperplane98,2,Sun Jul 5 17:50:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you! i didn't know that you got an extra researched item for winning a match. Time to break out the X-02, i guess :P  but i assume the research points are divided between the items then? or does it ""give"" you additional points and gives each item an equal amount of research points?"
acecombat,3c6gg8,yphan,2,Sun Jul 5 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"Every item gets an equal amount, unless one of them procs a research bonus.  Remember that items of higher tier or level requires more research, so their ""total percentage researched"" will appear lower."
acecombat,3c6gg8,huepaperplane98,2,Sun Jul 5 19:18:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, i was aware of the last one, but i had no idea of how points were distributed. I just thought it was completely random because it did look like it was completely random :P"

acecombat,3bzi1o,AceLuky,7,Fri Jul 3 12:14:00 2015 UTC,It's not a low tier plane. 625 cost is mid-tier bordering on high tier. It's effectively an MTD-lite.  Upgrade costs here : 4m to L10.

acecombat,3bzi1o,randalll8,5,Fri Jul 3 15:33:34 2015 UTC,"I have trouble with this F-4E, and what to think of it. Tier-wise it is pretty much equivalent to a Strike Eagle, with a really strong weapon loadout. I can't really qualify it as low tier because of those two facts. In fact, the stats show it as being MORE mobile than the vanilla F-15E, which is ridiculous, since the F-4 was well known to be a brick, while the F-15 was developed to be extremely maneuverable."

acecombat,3bzi1o,Red-Spacecat,2,Fri Jul 3 13:26:18 2015 UTC,"Indeed, every time i open that red box it's a single bloody ticket :P  I mean, why couldn't they put 30 tickets in red boxes and 100 tickets in gold boxes? it'd hurt no one, and opening a red box to find a single ticket/opening a gold box to find a misery of 30 tickets is saddening."
acecombat,3bzi1o,huepaperplane98,5,Fri Jul 3 14:19:50 2015 UTC,"I'm just thinking, if the R101 doesn't drop for me, it'll be in the store at one point. Not that it's going to cost 2500 tickets though..."
acecombat,3bzi1o,VladTheInstaller,2,Fri Jul 3 14:24:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, the CFA didn't drop for me and i'll wait for the store. Some have told me the CFA will only hit the stores in November, though (dunno how they calculated it/know it, but that's the closest estimative i got)."
acecombat,3bzi1o,huepaperplane98,2,Fri Jul 3 14:33:57 2015 UTC,"Since the A-10A -HH- was in the store last month, I'm guessing it's a 6 month thing."

When the gold box came i was thinking ""meh, i could bet it's 30 tickets again) and then BAM, new plane.  the HUD kinda ruined it a bit for me, though. since i've never played AC3, it's not got the nostalgia appeal for me, and the round tactical map and one-at-a-time missile/spw count display looks more like a tactical hindrance than anything."
acecombat,3bzi1o,huepaperplane98,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:01:36 2015 UTC,"I got the R-101 -NC- and I think it's a cool little jet but I'll probably never bother spending more than the Lv. 2 amount on it, and even then that still makes it inferior to most low level jets that were upgraded.

acecombat,3bzi1o,DrinkLiquidSnake,2,Fri Jul 3 12:48:25 2015 UTC,Do you imagine a F-22 flying in the same squadron with a Mig 21 and a F-16F?  It´s a super upgraded old plane like viper´s plane. Makes more sense for a mercenary that one of the most advanced and expensive planes in AC and real world.
acecombat,3bzi1o,FunyaaFireWire,3,Fri Jul 3 12:58:10 2015 UTC,"The way I took it is that it's probably the plane Reaper picks up after the events of Operation Bunker Shot, because he's basically the real world Mobius One.  And yeah,  I do imagine that.  Reaper's the one with the best performance in Bone Arrow Squadron, hell, the entire Arrowblades, by a wide margin.  His main competition for skill is probably Edge, who you as the player constantly outperform.  So I imagine Reaper makes more than enough money to get whatever plane he wants."
acecombat,3bzi1o,VladTheInstaller,2,Fri Jul 3 13:45:25 2015 UTC,"Canonically, we were already handed an F-35, so i don't think it's necessarily a stretch to think so.   Also, Viper is out. The F-16F's pilot hasn't spoken a word, as far as we know he may be killed off.   That F-4 unfortunately has ACE COMBAT decaled on it. Colorwise, it's spot on for a Reaper plane."
acecombat,3bzi1o,LeadFarmer6,2,Fri Jul 3 13:06:47 2015 UTC,Reaper in AC:I is a nod to Mobius from AC4 hence the F-22.  Also planes in the AC:I universe aren't expensive.

acecombat,3bxefu,ZeBastard,7,Thu Jul 2 23:04:32 2015 UTC,"Had a quick run through:   Menus have been smartened up. 'Cockpit' view has been replaced with a 'tracking camera', similar to OFF mode in HAWX.  But no aircraft had cockpits anyway sooo... New SFX added. Campaign so far, appears to be finished, with cutscenes, VO, etc. No new Challenges or Battle Scenarios.  (yet?) More stable.   I'm enjoying it so far.  Hopefully it'll continue to be updated as time goes on."
acecombat,3bxefu,triadorion,8,Thu Jul 2 23:07:12 2015 UTC,"More stable is relative.  I've still had two CTDs in only a couple of hours.   And some of the design choices are still questionable, like why have tons of variants you'll never use and not have the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, or the F/A-18 family?   Seriously, I'm still baffled by having like 15 F-104 Starfighter variants but not a single Hornet.  That being said, I can't harsh it too hard, considering the team making it is really small, and I'm sure modders can do wonders in cleaning up some of the rough edges.  And I can't deny, I'm having fun with it.  It just makes the flaws in the game more disappointing when they happen, because it's entertaining and a good diversion from Infinity."
acecombat,3bxefu,Thexare,6,Fri Jul 3 01:32:59 2015 UTC,"I imagine it's a lot easier and quicker to add more variants of an existing model than to add new ones. I mean, the Hornet is a particularly glaring omission, and I want my F-20 and X-29A, but I can entirely understand how it happened. At least some of the Starfighter variants are... interesting is the word I'll go with.  Modders will probably correct it before too long, given that there's already been just about every fictional AC plane added. They shouldn't have to, why the hell are we missing the Hornets seriously, but eh."
acecombat,3bxefu,triadorion,7,Fri Jul 3 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would assume so.  But yet it still strikes me as strange.  I would think it would be more important to get the bones for each family in and then add in the variants later because it's easier, and it's more akin to putting icing on a well baked cake.  Nevertheless, while I still find it baffling, I am also impressed by the sheer number of variants that did get dug up for many of these airframes."
acecombat,3bxefu,Thexare,7,Fri Jul 3 03:23:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, I fully agree - skipping the Hornet and Typhoon just makes my head hurt. Seeing how it happened doesn't mean I like or agree with the reasoning, and in this case I definitely find it questionable.  Hopefully the full release gets people into gear on the other fighters. Honestly, I won't be satisfied with the game until it's got the full AC5 plane list. I would say ""we can skip the Falken and Wyvern"", but let's be real here, they'll show up before the Tornado."

acecombat,3bxefu,triadorion,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:03:07 2015 UTC,"I've heard the same, which I'm looking forward to.  I suspect it'll be a free patch/free DLC because with mod community, they could just make mod versions of the plane for free and the DLC won't even sell because it's unnecessary.  Paid DLC will probably be extra features and modes, not just planes and skins.  I have little doubt that a lot of missing families will show up sooner or later in the game itself.

That match ended, I exited the lobby but in the lobby list it still mentioned my lobby. ._.  Campaign is pretty solid, though. It's not Ace Combat level, don't expect that kind of genius storytelling, but it's alright storytelling. My main issue is with the various voice-acted lines having different volume or incorrect lines playing here or there.  Still a very mixed bag, unfortunately. I suggest waiting until some of the more serious bugs, especially multiplayer-related, are actually ironed out."

But I am so burnt out from flying in PlanetSide 2 after these past few years and since I'm only doing supplied fuels on Infinity now that doesn't hold my attention too long. Guess I will try this out. Maybe even stream again for it.

acecombat,3bzluw,ExtraPlus,6,Fri Jul 3 12:57:21 2015 UTC,"Nerf   FAEB - Only one with old bomb drop mechanics of being launched out of a ball machine. Coupled with its giant AoE makes it a bit too effective and braindead. GPB at least gets a bye because of its tiny AoE. SFFS - Damage is fine. Reload and capacity is too good.   Buff   4AGM - For multirole only. They feel really sub par even with damage parts. Only good for cleaning out yellows and at that point you wish you just had FAEB instead. UGB - Too low damage, long reload, scales like shit with bomb parts, has worse momentum fall-off than any other bomb including current SFFS. 2 of these need to go. SOD - Needs a damage buff. Far too weak for its restricted blast radius. Add targeting range for free-fire like GPB. GPB - Why does the targeting on this feel terrible? MGP - More damage, reloadable and tied to normal MG so I don't strain my finger pressing both buttons at the same time. Also needs to be on more planes RKTL - Faster rate of fire or fires half a full salvo on a single press. Double tapping would fire both salvos normally. Rockets aren't bad but they tie you up to a target for too long and you have to wait for them to reload before you can use them again. Being able to choose two separate targets and not just one + general vicinity would go a long way. Doubly also needs to be on more planes.   I don't really find anything that OP otherwise."

Nerfed:  SFFS should have slower reload. That should make it a balanced weapon. Power is not a problem. SFFS suffers from the same issue that UGB suffered from: indiscriminate carpet bombing. They nerfed UGB too hard and people don't want to use them anymore (this is also part of why SFFS is strong. It was one of the closest replacements for the old UGB.)  LAGM AND LASM range could be nerfed by maybe 500 to 1000m. Or increase range of all other A2G SPW by a similar amount. That makes other A2G weapons more viable, thus improving overall balance.  Buffed:  SAAM is not viable in higher MR competition because of the time cost involved in guiding a SAAM. And even if you guide it the whole way, it is still dodgeable. Sure it has really good reload and damage, but I just don't see it as a worthwhile A2A weapon.  Bombers need more speed. They are just too easy to deny at the moment. But at the same time if they caught up to attackers, they would completely obviate the need for attackers. This is a complex issue.  4AAM has NO advantage over 6AAM. There should be a reason to use it. Why would you leave a weapon in the game that is a strictly worse version of a different weapon?  MPBM should be buffed by making the blinding light less annoying. MPBM is hard to use because it tends to get their users kicked out of rooms.  RKTL are strong situationally, due to the obscene DPS, but it has no useful parts. How about a quick launcher part that makes rockets be fired at a higher rate, so the player is not locked onto one target for as long?  This one is one that COULD be considered, could throw off game balance too much:  Each level of plane beyond 12 should add some small amount of damage to SPW, like 2%-4% or so. Currently, level 12 onwards only adds 1/2 a level of standard missile damage. For the price you are paying for your plane upgrade, you don't really get that much. And this measure should make the playing field more fair for low tier plane players who can go to 20. Otherwise they are forever stuck with weapons that are utterly unviable in high tier play regardless of the skill of the pilot. HCAA on F-5E? HAHAHAHAHA"

Regular guns should get a substantial buff in my opinion, especially against air targets: the only planes you can realistically down with MG only are the weak yellows. Or perhaps increase the damage multiplier the closer you get: it should only take a short burst a close range to down most fighters.  On the nerf side I'd like to see A2G weapons less effective on Moby Dick (same as they are against SOLG). People in bombers can basically wipe out the entire thing in a few seconds."

I like that it has a higher skill cap than UGBs or FAEBs to use properly, but  it just spreads way too much and can ruin anything it rains down on.  Personally, I'd also like to see the S/MTD nerfed by doing away with its LAGM (or its FAEB, either or) or by reducing its maximum speed.  Tired of seeing that bird everywhere.  I don't want them to nerf it into the ground, but it's still too good.  I'd replace whatever air-to-ground weapon it loses with probably an air-to-air weapon.  It shouldn't be more of a ground pounder than the Strike Eagle, you know?  It's for that reason I don't have a beef with the S/MTD -Stripes-.  Wouldn't mind a small 6AAM nerf too, either by reducing its range or its homing some at long range.   Also nerf the hell out of the Defense stat on FB-22s in NTDM.  Buff:  Buff the RKTL.  And the MGP.  And standard machine gun damage against orange and red air targets.  That way, it feels like you're doing more to shoot them down than hitting them with nothing but sticks and harsh language.  I'm not asking for AC6 machine guns here, I just know a 20mm cannon is going to do more than scratch damage to an F-22.  The SOD could probably use a small buff too.  I don't think I see anyone willingly use that except for low level FB-22 pilots.  Not that the FB-22 needs anything to buff."

acecombat,3bvbhw,the_warrior_saint,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:10:37 2015 UTC,"I can make a quick explanation then.  Piston-engined aircraft are powered by, well, piston engines, like the ones in a car (although the ones used in aircraft are usually especially designed for aircraft, the basic principle is the same. Instead of rotating the wheel axis in a car, the engine turns the propeller in a plane). Many WWII aircraft were powered by V-8 or V-12 engines (like the P-51), as well as radial engines (P-47). Some had superchargers for improved performance at high altitude, like most american planes.  Turboprop engines, in other hand, use a turbine instead of a piston engine to drive the propeller. (as the name says: turbine + propeller) It's basically a jet engine, but the thrust doesn't come from the exaust, but from the propeller. Since it doesn't need to provide thrust through the exaust, the engine can be smaller, more economic and cheaper than true jet engines.  Turboprop engines are usually more powerful than piston engines, while being much cheaper and more compact than conventional jet engines, albeit less powerful. These engines are very economic and are a popular choice for regional passanger/transport planes, single or two-engine civilian aircraft, and military trainers/counter-insurgency aircraft, like the Super Tucano. These engines are very economic for their performance, and deliver much more power than a piston engine.  You will also find variations of turboprop engines in almost all helicopters, but turning the main rotor instead of a propeller.  The problem is: they use jet fuel, and they like to have constant power to be economic (like in a plane; you usually keep the engine at a relatively constant power, such as when cruising), and it also performs best at relatively high RPM. For applications in cars, it would be very shitty, because it'd be more expensive, fueling it would be more expensive, it would have increased risk of fire, and it would eat away your fuel because in a car, you are always accelerating and decelerating and switching gears and staying stopped or at low speed, and this is the very opposite of constant, high power, so it's a really, really bad situation for a turboprop engine. That's why you'll never find a gas turbine engine (like a turboprop but whithout the ""prop"" part) under your car's hood, that is, unless your car happens to be a M-1 Abrams."

We speak Portuguese but indeed, Brazilian Portuguese sounds so different than Portuguese Portuguese (sometimes, Portugese English-speakers are mistaken by Russians) that, for example, in games with portuguese translation you sometimes see ""Português (PT)"" and ""Português (BR)"". some words are different too."

It looks as if someone took all the modern equipment from a current fighter jet, and then threw it into a WW2-era airframe. It sounds crazy, but it is actually a quite feasible and clever idea, really. And it has a good name.  Plus the idea of a prop aircraft on a modern battlefield is just a neat little anachronism (especially if we throw AC superplanes into the mix)."
acecombat,3bvbhw,avalon304,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:28:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, i absolutely love the Super Tucano. it is a larger, completely revised aircraft based on the earlier T-27 ""Tucano"" trainer. It's not just a modification of the Tucano, it's a completely new plane and it was actually designed for combat (well, not true war, but counter-insurgency and anti-drug operations. It'd be kinda hard to intercept slow, low-flying cessnas with supersonic jet fighters).  It's airframe is not quite WWII though, It's got a fairly modern airframe design for a propeller aircraft, and going into the engines instead of using a piston engine it uses a turboprop, which is more powerful and is the norm for today's high-performance propeller-driven aircraft (its performance is so good, the FAB uses it as a relatively inexpensive mean to introduce pilots to basic jet aircraft flight). It also sacrfices some guns for more external stores; It's got only (compared to WWII fighters) two .50 cal MGs, even though they are M3s and as such they have a helluva ROF, more than enough for mowing down paramilitary groups and drug-carrying cessnas.   Perhaps i'm just biased since i'm Brazilian, but i really think it deserves being included in AC. it can carry modern ordnance, such as laser-guided bombs, (as well as ""dumb"" bombs) air-to-air heatseeking missiles, rocket launcher pods, and air-to-ground missiles. See, we already have a SPW loadout: RKTL at lvl.1, GPB or UGB at lvl.4 and AGMs at lvl.8 :P  Because i mean, when the US Air Force decides a latin american plane is better than a US plane (A-29 vs AT-6B in the USAF competition for a light attack plane to be sent for Afghanistan's air force), you know it's good :P   EDIT: and once again, paperplane speaks too much.

If the F-35 is fighting the way it and other 5th Generation warplanes are designed to, an energy disadvantage at close range shouldn't be a problem to begin with.

acecombat,3bsc1n,triadorion,5,Wed Jul 1 21:59:17 2015 UTC,do you really think 5th gen equal no dogfight?   that's what the USAF said when jet and missile came into the game. Korean War and Vietnam War proved otherwise
acecombat,3bsc1n,AsterLong,2,Thu Jul 2 06:55:13 2015 UTC,"Korea and Vietnam also occurred when the AIM-7 and AIM-9 platforms were not fully battle proven and shown to work.  The Sparrows were ineffective at anything other than long range and the early Sidewinders were notoriously inaccurate.  As well, Korea and Vietnam took place when most fights required visual contact with your target.  The chief failure in Vietnam was removing internal cannons for short range combat.  Meanwhile, modern iterations of the the AIM-9 as well as the AIM-120 have proven battlefield reliability.  In this era, most combat in the air takes place beyond visual range, and stealth tech prevents you from easily being detected before you spike and splash your target.  The reality is that dogfighting circumstances are incredibly rare on the modern battlefield.  I too wonder why the F35 is suffering such energy disadvantages in short range, because it sounds like it shouldn't, but I question just how often it'd come into play."
acecombat,3bsc1n,triadorion,2,Thu Jul 2 12:40:08 2015 UTC,"Air to air combat in general is incredibly rare, though, so that doesn't mean much.  Additionally, the various countermeasures developed by modern military industrial corporations didn't exist in the Vietnam era and so are hard to take into account. My position is to simply not make assumptions and take anything for granted. Murphy's Law and all that.  As for the energy disadvantage, I'm guessing that's due to it being a heavily compromised airframe."
acecombat,3bsc1n,VladTheInstaller,2,Thu Jul 2 23:09:51 2015 UTC,"That's the safer position to take.  And the smarter one from an engineering perspective.  I see where a lot of the design philosophy that the government and military is coming from, and I understand it, but it's like you said: Murphy's Law.  And it goes back to the old saying amongst engineers: real skill in engineering is displayed not by how much you can put into something, but how much you can take out.  Simplicity is good.  Shame that everyone forgot that when designing this bird.  Should've just made carrier and land variants of the F-35 and designed an entirely separate VTOL platform for the Marine Corps."
acecombat,3bsc1n,triadorion,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:46:25 2015 UTC,Definitely agree with you on that last point. I get the feeling it would look like a J-31 if it did.  Regarding the taking stuff out: to make the STOVL version they had to remove a lot of safety equipment so now they've made the thing even more dangerous to pilots. Chatter is that it's possible an F-35 could be destroyed by a single round because of how few safety valves there are in the fuel system.

acecombat,3bsc1n,realitychheck,3,Thu Jul 2 12:51:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not a very knowledgeable person in this subject, but I studied the crap out of World War II.  I thought that the bubble canopy was one of the biggest advantages the P-51 brought to the table.  Didn't they originally start without it on the first model, and then add it for pretty much every aircraft after that which were expected to face dogfights?  That canopy looks all wrong.  I can see that pilot's head and I don't think he has a great view of his six.  More questions, hoping some of you guys will know.  At one point I thought someone implied that the F-35's detection system is what set it apart.  is that true?  How far along have missile defense features come?  Is there a good chance that fighters will be able to defeat missiles and close for dogfights in the future?  On a regular enough basis to put F-35 pilots at more risk if this analysis is true?"
acecombat,3bsc1n,VladTheInstaller,3,Wed Jul 1 20:09:08 2015 UTC,"With regard to the canopy, the F-35 is designed to operate with a special helmet which allows the pilot to see a HUD no matter where he/she looks. Think like how the HUD works in Ace Combat: Infinity. The problem was that the helmet was too large for the pilot to effectively look over his/her shoulder to see the following F-16D.  On the issue of closing for engagement: not sure about closing, but with regards to evasion of missiles, it's worth noting that the F-35 pretty much just uses AMRAAMs, IIRC. The consequence of just using one seeker type and one missile, means that the OPFOR just needs to learn how to defeat that one threat to survive. I know the Russians are developing a wide variety of effective ECM to jam radar, and are even experimenting with loading their 30mm cannon with chaff round to foul approaching radar AA missiles. That could give them the ability to close range on the F-35s. China also has their own modified F-35 called the J-31, which appears to be a more agile and powerful version with none of the multiple-branch related pitfalls; It remains to be seen if that's an effective platform, though.  Finally, remember that the US assumed they had air-superiority in Vietnam due to their F-4's superior missile technology. Little did they know that the limitations of missile design and the F-4's own design oversights lead to them getting their ass handed to them by the Soviet MiG-21 pilots."

I think my questions and your answers are still pretty important.  I'm not sure how effective missile foiling systems can really get, but I can imagine scenarios where after missiles are depleted, it may still be necessary to engage and destroy a hostile fighter....  At which point, you better be able to dogfight.  Not to mention the eventuality of everyone having stealth fighters in theater."

Instead they've insisted on continuing with this bastardized design."
acecombat,3bsc1n,PAK-FAace,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:37:21 2015 UTC,"Two different aircraft would be more costly than having a single design. Think about it, you have to design it from the ground up, have said design revolve around the set parameters for it's role, parts commonality between services would be zip, which would mean more maintenance, completely new avionics suite..there's just much to list. There's a reason why the Navy opted to have the F/A-18 Super Hornet fulfill different roles: It's less costly to operate one design than 3 to 4 different kinds. Again, this has to do mostly with logistics and the such."

The whole reason the project is a shambles is because they're trying to do too much with one platform. The F/A-18 is so effective because it's a relatively simple multirole aircraft that can take off from a carrier with a variety of weapon loads; That's pretty much it's design philosophy. It doesn't need a huge body to house a (non-existent) VTOL system and limited internal weapons bay that usually has to be supported with stealth-damaging external pylon loads."

Since then, warisboring has [finally] published their source, which I've read. It's pretty interesting, and confirms basically everything in the above. The takeaway is basically that the FCS allowances need a lot of adjusting, but when they are, it'll basically fight less like a Viper and more like a Bug: great in a downhill turning fight, not so much if you try to take it uphill or bleed all your energy with showy maneuvers like an asshole.  It's not glamorous like its predecessors, and the software limits are frustrating, but we've been fighting and winning in planes like this for a long while."
acecombat,3bsc1n,PAK-FAace,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:54:50 2015 UTC,"<rant> In all honesty, this is just sad.  With a heritage consisting of the Nighthawk, the Blackbird, and the Raptor, among others, this is a disgrace on their, otherwise very good, track record.  I hate this notion that Stealth is the 'be-all-end-all' of Air Combat.  Bloody wrong.  McDonnell Douglas made the same bloody mistake with the early F-4's; no matter how good your long-range capabilities (in any field) are, a Fighter still needs to be able to dogfight.  When you compromise things like mobility, weapons carriage, and speed for one other variable, (in this case, stealth), you're already going about this the wrong way.  The fact that it's made for three different branches, all with completely different missions, it just won't work.  I'll say right now, I blame the Marines.  Their insistence on a VTOL design has influenced the Air Force and Navy models, with a wide, fat body.  Ironically, the Chinese J-31, supposedly a 'copy' of the F-35 from compromised design specs, looks to be a better performer.  It lacks the VTOL fan of the B model, which allows it to have a slimmer body, and a centerline weapons bay.  (Increasing payload capacity.)  Also, two engines on the J-31 will always be safer than the F-35's single.  It's quite pathetic, that the 'Chinese Knockoff' maybe better than the real deal.  Stealth is overrated anyway.  Pretty soon, aircraft like the Russian PAK-FA, the Chinese J-20 and J-31 may be fielded.  Then, no one will be able to detect each other until they are WVR.  At that point, dogfighting ability will determine who wins that engagement.  And to be honest, the 'Lightning will strike' the F-35 in this case by the looks of it. </rant>"
acecombat,3bsc1n,ZeBastard,3,Wed Jul 1 21:38:10 2015 UTC,"Twin engine aircraft have a lot more mishaps than single engines. The F-15, F/A-18, and F-22 have had multiple incidents having to do with engines, while late model F-16s and F-35 have had very few. The PAK-FA, J-20, and J-31 don't even have they're real engines yet. So no, the J-31 is anything but ""superior"". The PAK-FA and J-20 won't be fully operational for another 5-10 years. By then, the F-35 would have the soon to be revealed 6th gen F/A-XX at it's side, and that's a completely different story.

China aren't exactly poor; they could very well produce good engines that give its jets a sharp pair of teeth.  My analysis of the J-31 was looking at it from a theoretical POV; Slimmer body + larger weapon bays + extra engine, (More power overall maybe?), could, in theory, beat out the Lightning."
acecombat,3bsc1n,VladTheInstaller,2,Thu Jul 2 00:09:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, that is true. Having an engine to fall back on would be nice, but with how advanced engine systems are today..is it relevant. A slimmer body does not necessarily mean that it's more agile. Take for example, the F-15. Slimmer than the slightly more bulky Su-27, but the Flanker could run circles around it. Extra engine means that you need two engines to supply the desired performance. The F135 is currently the most powerful fighter turbofan on the planet, able to supply around 40,000lbs of thrust total. The J-31 currently uses the MiG-29's engines. The same applies to the PAK-FA, which still uses the Saturn Turbofans that the Flanker series still uses. Until the right engine is supplied, the PAK-FA, J-20, and J-31 are not true 5th gen fighters."
acecombat,3bsc1n,PAK-FAace,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:21:12 2015 UTC,"Quite simply, it's relevant if the engine fails.

acecombat,3bsc1n,VladTheInstaller,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:43:10 2015 UTC,"That's true, but the point still stands. Twin-engined fighters have had much more incidents than single-engined ones. Late-Model F-16s have had almost no engine failures, while the F-15 and F/A-18 have had numerous. Engines nowadays aren't as unreliable as they were 40 years ago.

The lack of a second engine, combined with the lightening of the airframe by removal of strengthening structures and safety systems is just an accident waiting to happen.

And even then, that's if we assume we're still in the Cold War and such an engagement would even happen to begin with. All the US is gonna use these stupid-expensive toys for is bombing allahu snackbars in desert hellholes, so toys like the F-35 are pretty much unnecessary anyway, but that's the actual reason and not its supposed lack of maneuverability (""supposed"" because that ""report"" is rather questionable)."

It is one of the finest Multiroles in the entire game, and one of the most cost effective planes you could ever ask for.  Its special weapon loadout is great: 4AAMs are its poorest weapon, and even those are good.  SFFS and 4AGM are both really good but vary on what maps they really shine on.  It might even simply be a matter of preference in many cases.  SFFS is the new meta and is better for clustered hard targets, but in personal experience, 4AGMs almost never let me down on my F-35.  I would call the Strike Eagle absolutely worth taking above Level 10.  You really can't go wrong with this plane."

acecombat,3bt2wb,FunyaaFireWire,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:43:10 2015 UTC,No. Each circle does the amount of damage of one shard. You need multiple circles to do huge damage.
acecombat,3bt2wb,Ikillu4ever93,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:53:29 2015 UTC,How exactly do you do the multiple circles thingy? Take me through your process please.
acecombat,3bt2wb,Ikillu4ever93,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:43:14 2015 UTC,copied from another post  To put it simply. Speed and angle changes the spread. Time till impact changes how many pellets spawn. 2000km/h at 1000m up will give you less pellets than 1000km/h at same height.   Speed affects how far the bomb is launched from your plan. Both speed and angle affect your AoE. Slower speed and dives will tighten the AoE while faster speeds and climbs will enlarge the circle.
acecombat,3bt2wb,Ikillu4ever93,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:16:44 2015 UTC,The SFFS actually don't have concentrated damage. And the pod is for A2G targeting. It's all superficial.

It's just hard to save up all my money for one of those Next Gen planes, unless I luck out for the -Neucom-, I don't see me taking of those beasts past level 3.  Level 12 S/MTD with part boosted FAEBs has been fantastic. Clears the map of soft, scattered ground targets, with what I believe to be the widest area of effect.

acecombat,3bmsr9,FunyaaFireWire,3,Tue Jun 30 15:02:14 2015 UTC,"Effective but slow. Means that if you have any competition for points, you're going to get rocked. They'll almost always lose phase 1 of any stage to any A2G players. Phase 2 they have to rely on hovering around the spawn points and they're pretty good at it as long as the enemies aren't spread out too much (Moscow / Alps are good examples) but it usually won't be enough to offset any lead any other A2G players will have accrued.  If nobody is flying A2G or the targets are tough and really spread out (4P/6P Avalon is a prime example) then you'll do fine, otherwise have fun picking up all the yellows  Also they're expensive as fuck to level up.  PvP they need ECM escorts otherwise they tend to get shot down too much and far too often before they can reach the ships with their MGPBs. If they can get there and are protected well, they can single handedly carry NTDM though."
acecombat,3bmsr9,FunyaaFireWire,3,Tue Jun 30 15:11:47 2015 UTC,I disagree that you auto lose phase 1. Places like Avalon are so big that even if everyone is in attackers you can still mvp (as long as you're in a 2 vs 2 room).

acecombat,3bi470,ComradePutinCCCP1917,12,Mon Jun 29 12:20:14 2015 UTC,JasonChan.  Flies.  With novice controls.  WHAT KIND OF NUGGET LIKE HIM CAN GET ALMOST 3000MR
acecombat,3bi470,triadorion,10,Mon Jun 29 12:21:57 2015 UTC,The kind of nugget that clubs rookies and spends hundreds and hundreds of dollars to get the best seal clubbing kit.
acecombat,3bi470,DrinkLiquidSnake,4,Mon Jun 29 12:36:07 2015 UTC,I always though the novice controls were better for bombing. It's what I use. I flew about 4 sorties before realizing I perform better with the novice controls. Is there something I'm doing wrong?
acecombat,3bi470,FunyaaFireWire,4,Mon Jun 29 14:38:19 2015 UTC,Objectively novice controls are worse because you have less freedom of movement (e.g it's impossible to do a loop downwards to get behind a target underneath you. You have to pitch your nose down which takes far far longer than rolling and pitching upwards while upside down). Personally I also dislike it because the camera feels loose and it's a bit off putting.  You won't notice it much for bomber though as you tend to not need to do quick rolls and loops so it may be more preferential.
acecombat,3bi470,huepaperplane98,2,Mon Jun 29 15:07:57 2015 UTC,"I use novice controls when i go for ground atack in general, because it makes aiming with the guns very, very easy and remarkably quick, and the gun is surprisingly useful for ground attacking. When i go for air targets only or in TDM, i use normal controls though. Flying novice controls in TDM is asking to be shot down over and over again. (source: once forgot to turn off novice controls after going from a ground attack match into a TDM. It wasn't pretty.)"
acecombat,3bi470,lockspeed-99,3,Mon Jun 29 17:07:28 2015 UTC,"Never found it necessary to fly novice, even on ground attack runs. I can stabilize my aircraft using Auto-Stabilize and use Yaw for strafing runs.  The maneuverability granted by Expert Controls is just too precious to abandon. This is probably why I survived for far too long piloting Harriers and F-4Gs in NTDM."
acecombat,3bi470,FunyaaFireWire,2,Mon Jun 29 18:12:45 2015 UTC,Pretty much this. Expert does everything novice can do and more. If you want to get better there's no reason to be limited by the control scheme.

acecombat,3bi470,triadorion,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:04:44 2015 UTC,"Well, at this point, everyone knows how much and how remorselessly he clubs seals.  It's not a shock to hear JasonChan clubbed a 1400 MR nugget.  Must be a day that ends in ""Y.""  But to hear he does this shit and flies with Novice controls?  It just makes the clubbing and artificially inflated MR look even more damning as a pilot.  It makes you wonder how much of his performance in the video is actual skill compared to just having the right kit for the job and being willing to pay far out the nose to get it.   He's clearly not a total slapdash hackjob of a pilot, given he knows the routes of the fighter planes and when spawns show up and takes them out efficiently.  But I question how much of it is rote memorization, and how flexible he'd be on a truly dynamic battlefield, especially if he had some worthy opponents in the mix too."
acecombat,3bi470,99demo,3,Mon Jun 29 23:51:49 2015 UTC,Why is his damage healing?
acecombat,3bi470,triadorion,8,Mon Jun 29 14:46:28 2015 UTC,Probably using a Fire Extinguisher part that restores some HP after you hit a certain threshold.  Useful for bombers and attackers.

I'm most effective in my F-35.  My favorite is my Phantom.  I have other setups and high level planes, but those are the four I'm most likely to use."

Su-24MP ECM - For sneaking up behind unsuspecting giant aircraft and machine-gunning them up the bum. PEWPEW! Su-25TM UGB - Moscow Battle and nothing else because it's too damn slow. Su-33 HVAA - Naval TDM air defence and any co-op map that has the player start over water. Su-34 4AGM ""Sweeper"" - Maps with many small targets spread apart from each other. Su-34 LAGM - For maps with many hard targets or could benefit from the blast radius to get around buildings, also for making STD pilots rage-quit. Su-34 GPB - NTDM attacking (catch me if you can) and nothing else. Su-35 6AAM - Moscow Battle and other swarmy air battles that need some crowd control. Su-37 QAAM - TDM and nothing else."

Not to mention the ""muh german engineering, german planes best, mineshells = mini-nukes"" guys in the forums. And to make it worse, it's only anything slightly close to a simulation in, well, ""sim battles""; outside of that, even in the so-called ""realistic"" battles, it's not really anything close to simulation.  I like to play all sorts of flight games; while i ocasionally play flight sims as well, i usually play ace combat because it's much better suited to casual playing. I have almost stopped playing WT in order to play a bit more AC - and of course devote more of my time to study."

acecombat,3barwu,huepaperplane98,2,Sat Jun 27 15:02:17 2015 UTC,I'd agree with that on special weapons and there is evidence to prove it. I would say that the most useful SP.W. part for lower level jets would be awareness parts if the weapon is accurate and powerful enough to hit and kill MiG-29As reliably.

Or you can also attach a rocket engine on a MiG-21 and destroy a space station with it or just put a UGB bomb on a rocket.  3rd:  Unknown F16 game  The game was really old.

acecombat,3b04en,ComradePutinCCCP1917,2,Wed Jun 24 23:19:18 2015 UTC,"I recently bought and got into Vector Thrust. It may be considered Early Access, which I avoid 90% of the time, but it offers enough variety and enjoyment that it seemed worth buying while it was on sale. Even runs pretty alright on my toaster of a laptop, until some big battles involving an Aigaion-esque bomber anyway. My favorite part about it is that it plays very similar to the Ace Combat gamed. Not TOO arcadey, not TOO sim-like, just somewhere between the middle leaning towards arcadey. Plus there are quite a few mods for it, including many Ace Combat themed ones (missions, planes, music), so that was a major plus.  Another game, one that I remember from my childhood, was Jane's F-15. Back then, I mostly just flew around in the maps I made after screwing around with the editor, hardly touching the actual missions, but it was still quite fun regardless. Even had a decent selection of aircraft aside from the F-15, including for some reason a pilotable cruise missile. One thing that will always be burned into my mind is hearing the cockpit voice warning ""YAW RIGHT, YAW RIGHT"" and hearing the co-pilot spam ""Bombs away! Pickle! Pickle! Bombs away!"" due to dropping hundreds of bombs with infinite munitions on.  Also Ace Combat 04 is pretty much a given for me, being my first Ace Combat game. Don't think I really have to explain why I loved it around here. But there's also Ace Combat 6, because despite the incredibly cheesey story, not to mention being an Xbox 360 exclusive, it's still an Ace Combat game at it's heart, and one hell of a game to play. I'll never forget the first time Chandelier's massive cannon blast froze up my Xbox, making me all the more determined to destroy the cruise missiles before it was loaded (that and to save Gracemeria too, I guess)."

Some of my favorite sims include Red Baron (DOS) and Aces Over The Pacific (DOS), both back in the golden age of Dynamix.  After that, I moved more to TIE Fighter, (DOS Collector's CD ROM Edition) X-Wing Vs. TIE Fighter, and X-Wing Alliance.  I used to be pretty ace in XvT in particular.  I only ever made the Top Ace Rating in that game, but I regularly could beat people who made Jedi / Jedi Master rank.   And then after that, my first Ace Combat experience was Unsung War, and that became my favorite flight series for fun purposes.  I got HAWX used, found it fun, if generally inferior to Ace Combat in every meaningful way.  Then I picked up Strike Suit Infinity, which was a blast of a wave-based survival arcade space flight/mobile suit game.  I own its campaign based counterpart, Strike Suit Zero, but I've never gotten around to playing it.   My most recent purchase was taking the dive on the Early Access Vector Thrust while it was on sale.  Vector Thrust is still pretty rough and has some questionable design decisions, and I hate the piss poor tracking on its Sidewinders, but I see a lot of potential in it.  I've enjoyed it for what it is, but look forward to it being polished.  I could easily see it becoming more of a favorite once it's cleaned up significantly.  Overall, Red Baron and TIE Fighter still occupy the slots as my ""favorite"" sims ever.  I credit Red Baron for getting me into aviation, airplanes, history, and flight games entirely, so if there was one game that had a heavy impact in my life, it's that one."

acecombat,3aycyl,huepaperplane98,5,Wed Jun 24 16:26:15 2015 UTC,"You sir, are a true fan! I only own the PS2 titles (have a PS1, but didn't know the series back then; don't own a Xbox 360), and i quite like them, but AC6 and AC2 are games i'd like to play if i ever get the chance."
acecombat,3aycyl,Salvo1218,6,Wed Jun 24 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"AC6 is good because what it lacks in available planes it makes up for in gameplay. Large missions with multiple tasks at hand that you can select on the fly (no pun intended). AC2 is simple by modern standards and tough to play again once you're used to the rotating camera and target tracking cam, but still a lot of fun. Those early games were the first to do things that we've seen in every title since like tunnel and canyon missions, massive air to air furball missions, massive flying carriers/gunships, ridiculous superweapons and so on. I guess I've taken for granted still having my ps2 and old games"

I was a small child back then (around 5, 6 or 7 years, i guess; yes, my memory sucks) and i almost shit my pants every time Stonehenge fired. When Skyeye announced it was firing, i almost kissed the ground with my jets, and kept following the terrain at ridiculously low altitude until the threat was gone. I remember i failed ""tango line"" mission multiple times because i refused to engage targets while flying low to avoid Stonehenge and i refused attacking targets dug in the mountains for fear i wouldn't be able to drop to below 2000 feet. One day, i learned i could attack the submarines while being fired upon by stonehenge, and dive-bombing was a good tactic with the Harrier nests dug in the mountains; then i failed no more.  I later played AC:5 and, relatively recently, Zero. Must say, the AC classics were the best games i've ever played, in my opinion; beats even my beloved Battlefield series by a long shot, but that probably has something to do with me being an aviation enthusiast ""weirdo"" (i swear,if you love planes as a small child, spend lots of time researching about it and talk to your friends, no one will take you seriously, especially here in Brazil where most people are unaware of what even makes a plane fly, and only buy mainstream games), ""huehuehue""!"
acecombat,3aycyl,PAK-FAace,5,Wed Jun 24 16:36:32 2015 UTC,"AC3 PAL version, back in 2001 or so. Just a weird coincidence since it happened to be among a bunch of games that a friend got from a friend of his, and we happened to try it out. I'd never played anything like that before and it just blew my mind, even though I sucked at it (and that's playing with novice controls training wheels, which I didn't take off until ACZ came out). Funnily enough AC3 is one of my least favorite games in the series nowadays, including the original Japanese version, but back in the day? I played the shit out of that.  After that I played AC2 at some point, which I liked even better right away. In 2005 I got a PS2 and soon after AC5, which again proceeded to blow my mind (at the time it was like holy shit dat story/radio chatter/music/graphics) and yet now it's also one of my least favorite entries (notice a pattern here). I played AC04 some time later, and initially I didn't like it so much because of the slower handling and long missions, but eventually grew on me for those and other reasons. I got ACZ on release, and since by that time I was already not such a big fan of AC5's mission design, it instantly became my favorite since it combined AC5's handling and mechanics with mission design more similar to AC04's.  Come early 2008, and I figured it was about time to stop being a whole console generation behind and got a 360 with AC6 after drooling at the trailers and gameplay footage for 5 months. And the rest is history (involving disgust at AH, playing the PSP games at some point in there and getting a used PS3 for little more than ACI)."

It was shown in a booth selling large display screens in a crowded local computer fair in 2008.  I asked around my local friends and see if they know the series, and what games were recommended. One replied saying I should start with Zero, and that was indeed where I took off.

While it is nice in TDM, I think Prop S is enough before you hit the absolute diminishing returns cap.  I like quicker lock-on time because players won't stay still if they notice you have tone, they'll be flying wildly trying to avoid you and breaking lock many many times (unless they're those lazy L15 FB-22s with double bomb power GPBs who don't care if they get shot down). Without it, you may miss a chance to get a clean shot. You can say the same for Propulsion but I find that a bit harder to judge whether it would've made a difference or not.  common scenario: you're behind somebody doing a high-g turn without lock because you're trying to match his turn. He exits his turn and rolls his plane to turn the other way, without quick-lock you might not lock-on fast enough to shoot him at his vulnerable point of rolling."
acecombat,3auwmu,jwyche008,6,Tue Jun 23 18:28:13 2015 UTC,"If you drop seeking cooling unit (lock-on time is based on how far the target is from the center of your screen, use your yaw and pitch to make it faster) you can fit in homing LW and FAEB M."
acecombat,3auwmu,FunyaaFireWire,5,Tue Jun 23 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"This. I agree.  Homing LW will pay dividends when you engage air targets.  Can never have enough homing, if you ask me, and LW is very cost effective.  Also, insert obligatory S/MTD hate here, blah blah blah.   :V"
acecombat,3auwmu,triadorion,2,Tue Jun 23 18:57:38 2015 UTC,"Okay, since two of you are suggesting it I'll give it a try tonight when I get home."
acecombat,3auwmu,FunyaaFireWire,3,Tue Jun 23 18:59:18 2015 UTC,I know what you mean and obviously it's a sound strategy. The main reason I haven't done it is during the late part of maps like Moscow when I'm linked with an ally and my Quick Reload datalink is active it lets me fire missiles basically at will.
acecombat,3auwmu,DrinkLiquidSnake,3,Tue Jun 23 18:57:36 2015 UTC,"Most of my time during reloads is getting behind the enemy so that when my missle is loaded, I get instant tone, if not, I'm working on getting a better angle (which homing LW really helps for) when I already have tone so seeker doesn't help. I never felt I was in a situation where I could benefit from increased lock-on speed.  Its up to your playstyle though. I just much prefer having a wider angle of attack."
acecombat,3auwmu,DrinkLiquidSnake,2,Tue Jun 23 19:06:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I heard you, that makes sense. I'll try both configurations and see which ones give me a better score."
acecombat,3auwmu,DrinkLiquidSnake,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:13:08 2015 UTC,Couldn't have said it better myself.
acecombat,3auwmu,DrinkLiquidSnake,2,Wed Jun 24 05:48:04 2015 UTC,I recently switched out  FAEB EXPLOSIVES M  and   ADVANCED HARDPOINTS M  For   FAEB EXPLOSIVES S  and   ADVANCED HARDPOINTS L  My reasoning being I would rather have more explosives with smaller damage radius compared to less with greater damage radius.
acecombat,3auwmu,LeadFarmer6,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:34:19 2015 UTC,"Nice, what's the plane's Cst at this point? Mine's 1866 with a very similar set of parts"

acecombat,3attl6,Red-Spacecat,9,Tue Jun 23 13:31:39 2015 UTC,"You need a capture card, most good ones which run well over $100. I managed to borrow Elgato from my flatmate for my recordings over the spring.  You also need to hook it up with a PC for the recording software.  Edit: In case of Elgato, make sure to turn off automatic conversion after recording if the video's going to be edited. I've accidentally ruined many video qualities this way."
acecombat,3attl6,Doctor_Dan,2,Tue Jun 23 13:37:33 2015 UTC,"I strongly suggest using elgato too.  Although if you want something on the fly, my rocket works well. Just plug in the thumb drive, viola!  But be advised in case you chose rocket, there's some artifact problem when capturing ACI."
acecombat,3attl6,prinniev,2,Tue Jun 23 14:10:18 2015 UTC,+1 I also use ElGato but Avermedia LGP is also good if you wanted something that is PC free.  edit: Also you may or may not need a HDMI splitter to strip the HDCP. My ElGato needs one while my LGP doesn't.
acecombat,3attl6,FunyaaFireWire,2,Tue Jun 23 17:17:27 2015 UTC,Splitters can do that? Any downsides to quality using a splitter?
acecombat,3attl6,yphan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:51:11 2015 UTC,"It depends on the splitter tbh. Some do, some don't. My one just happens to.   For quality, I have noticed no difference up to 1080p. Its perfect."
acecombat,3attl6,FunyaaFireWire,4,Wed Jun 24 03:16:13 2015 UTC,"As a computer enthusiast (Or member of /r/pcmasterrace):  You'll need a capture card.  PCIe (or ""internal"" if you want a simple term) cards are waaaay betterr than USB recording equipment. This is because of the ""bandwidth cap"" or the maximum amount of data that can be sent using an USB port.  Even if you disagree with the fact that PCs are not superior to consoles, you should go to /r/pcmasterrace and ask for a good capture card that fits your needs.  Don't think we spit on console players, we're pretty friendly and will kindly help you if you're willing to learn a bit about capture cards and how they work / why you need one.    EDIT: If you ask me, you don't need lightning-fast equipment. If you want to record gameplay from Ace Combat Infinity ONLY, you'll need to record at 720p 30fps (since the game runs at these settings) Don't get freaked out by the chips and all the things soldered to the card, you just need to plug it (there's only one way to do so, it's really easy and you can't do anything wrong) and launch the computer.  I'm not in the US so I don't know if the price is good, but this card is perfect for your use. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16815100098&cm_re=capture_card-_-15-100-098-_-Product  However, make sure your CPU (also known as ""Processor"") is beefy enough to ""encode"" (turn the video stream from the console into a .mp4 file) your gameplay."
acecombat,3attl6,ComradePutinCCCP1917,4,Tue Jun 23 13:50:11 2015 UTC,I... I own a mac. Probably complicates things a bit.
acecombat,3attl6,ComradePutinCCCP1917,3,Tue Jun 23 14:01:26 2015 UTC,"Then you'll be unable to install an internal card.  You can look for an USB recorder, but don't expect the performances of an internal card.  This one is probably enough. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16815100173&cm_re=capture_card-_-15-100-173-_-Product"
acecombat,3attl6,prinniev,3,Tue Jun 23 14:04:14 2015 UTC,Woo! Is this avermedia's new pc-free offering? I remember choosing between hauppauge's rocket (thumb drive) and Avermedia's live gamer pro (SD card). I chose the rocket instead because of it's flexibility.  Nice to see another product from them.
