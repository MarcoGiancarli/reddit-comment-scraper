Free:   Tamarack Nature Center in Woodbury White Bear Township Oakdale Nature Reserve Como Zoo and the conservatory Central Park in Roseville has 3 playgrounds, a lake, several walking paths, and a boardwalk through a marshy area Libraries, during the summer there are free performances and programs at most of them. Some libraries also have passes you can check out to visit the MN children's museum for free during select hours. Swimming at a lake, many have free life jacket rentals if kids aren't proficient swimmers Chutes and Ladders playground in Bloomington Most if not all parks in Minneapolis have wading pools. 7 may be getting a little old for that size of pool though.   Other ideas that aren't necessarily free but are fun for kids:   Snuffy's, a burger and malt shop (there are several in the twin cities) Kids eat free on Tuesdays at Pizza Ranch, and Sundays at Baja Sol (there are other places that have free kids meals but those are the only ones that come to mind) Choo Choo Bobs is a train store in St. Paul with an area to play with train tables, some kids are into that. Also it is next to Izzy's which is a delicious ice cream shop. Teddy Bear Park in Stillwater is free, then get lunch at one of the restaurants nearby or stop at Candyland for a bag of sweets. You can also walk down by the St. Croix river and watch the lift bridge. ArtScraps and Axman are both St. Paul stores that sell basically junk but it is a fun, cheap way to get supplies for kid's projects and crafts Ride the light rail, we have ridden to the U campus and walked around, or downtown Mpls and roam the skyway Minnehaha Falls which I think has paid parking Lake Elmo reserve has $5 parking, lots of hiking and fishing, and a man made swimming pond. They also have concessions there. Water parks: Como, Battle Creek and Jim Lupient are ones I've been to. They range from $4-8 per person.    This list got long, hope it is helpful!  Edit: one more I thought of is Chatterbox, in Highland Park. It is a restaurant mainly geared towards high school kids but I have taken my oldest (11 y/o) there on mother-son outings. You can check out board games and they also have tables hooked up with old school video games that you can play and hang out there. It is a lot of fun!"

She might be too young for some of the more ambitious rides, but there's a full waterpark and lots of kid-friendly stuff.   If she likes science, the MN Science Museum is one of the top rated in the country (and make sure you take her up the musical stairs).   The Planetarium is another great science-y place to go.

When it comes to whiskey, I keep the good stuff on hand for sipping and tend to splurge when it comes to wine and liqueurs.  (I drink a LOT of Aperol and Prosecco in the summer.)

MGM used to be the only liquor store in that area:  Burnsville only issued permits if a liquor store was over a mile away from another one.  The city changed the liquor licensing as a requirement by Costco.  The only reason Haskell's was even able to open their store was because of that change and they knew before opening that they'd be competing against a Cub, MGM and Costco all within a 3/4 mile bubble.  5 liquor stores within walking distance of each other.  Haskell's might have had a chance to survive if MGM was still the only store around but they decided to open a store in an area that was saturated even before Total Wine opened.  I mean, jesus, they could have opened the store across the highway or something and at least picked up some sales from people who'd rather not deal with crossing 42!"

TwinCities,3e2imf,UndercookedPizza,4,Tue Jul 21 20:54:58 2015 UTC,"Because it would make them non-competitive. The larger stores that can afford to hire lots of people would be open on Sundays, so they'd get the extra business while the small stores would be closed and miss out.  I'm not saying I agree with them, but that's the argument.  IMO they should make liquor sales legal on Sundays and if the smaller stores need a day off, close on Monday instead. I doubt Monday sales would eclipse Sunday sales, so closing on that one day wouldn't be a major hit to their business."

That's what I mean.  Yes they were not a true monopoly, but since it took Total Wine to come in here for prices to come down, obviously nobody wanted to undercut.  Why did Total Wine come in to MN with its arcane liquor laws?  Because they saw a marketplace where the status quo was the consumer being plundered by liquor store owners who were content to maintain inflated prices. Again good riddance to the ""mom and pop"" stores.  We owe them NOTHING. Edit:  There is no way Total Wine eliminates all competition, so that is a strawman if I ever seen one."

MN's liquor store owners, however, have shown that they can band together for political cause. I have a feeling they're not going to take this lying down.

TwinCities,3e2iuc,gAlienLifeform,3,Tue Jul 21 13:35:07 2015 UTC,"I really hate the arguments that  if you don't like airport noise you shouldn't have moved next to an Airport. First roughly 100,000KLINK people live within a 2.5 mile distance from the perimeter of the airport, so its not like its some small percentage of people who experience the noise, or some fringe group of people.  Secondly if we use the slippery slope argument, then we must accept if there is one 1 plane per day or 1 million planes per day simply because people happen to live next to an airport? In the eyes of a ""welp you shouldn't have moved there"" person either  complaint of 1 plane or 1 millions planes to mucg are each equal. That's like arguing that if you lived next to a freeway that went from 1 car per day to a 1000/hr and then asked for a sound wall and saying...""welp you shouldn't have moved next to a freeway"". In fact there never should be any soundwalls as  roads typically exist before homes, and likely any residents that lived when the first roads were built have likely passed away. And certainty we should do nothing to improve the impact of road noise on communities because they should accept it, along with road pollution.  Also why have airplanes got quieter over time? Certainly, and that came from people and cities taking actions that reduce the impact of airplane noise on residents and encouraging them to reduce noise of planes by their design. Again if we simply took the case in which we should just accept any level of airport noise because someone happens to live next to an airport then every plane could be as loud like its 1950 again.  No one is asking for the airport to shut down, it just a question of livability in a city in which airplane noise is one of many factors. Everyone recognizes its a balancing act, between providing a avenue for commerce and travel, while at the same time not ruining a very livable and many ways desirable portion of the city. Its especially important for Minneapolis, Eagan and huge chunks of their city, and there tax base come from these areas. It is interesting that homes by Minnehaha which are directly under the flight path sell for over 600K regularly, so a major impact to that area that drives home values down is a big issue for MPLS as a city.  Its a compromise, plain(or should I say plane) and simple  Note: I am not impacted really at all by airplane noise and simply see the argument from both sides. I think everyone recognizes the stupidity of not moving the airport when we had the chance, and now we have to suffer through the consequences."

This is a losing battle for people that live near airports. The airports are not going to fly less or stop flying during certain hours because a few thousand people are complaining.    People that have been a long time resident, I feel for them as they dealt with the airport getting more and more active.

TwinCities,3e2iuc,bobpuller,4,Tue Jul 21 16:56:50 2015 UTC,"In addition to what others have said about living in a location for a long time, people also forget that the airport has built new runways since then. They also forget that approach and departure patterns have also been shifted numerous times. Even just a couple years ago they changed it, and just last fall they were talking about some additional changes.  http://www.myfoxtwincities.com/story/20089889/faa-flight-plans-frustrate-homeowners-in-new-plane-paths  http://www.startribune.com/new-msp-flight-paths-would-shift-noise-in-dakota-county/176664231/  I live in Eagan, and get some plane noise, but I don't live near the busy vectors that see most of the noise. During peak evening times we'll maybe get 5-8 planes sent over my house, and only on southbound departures, and nothing bigger than a 737/A320. We do not here arrivals at all, ever.  BUT, while we would never get arrivals where I'm at, they could shift flight paths some day, and I could get a ton more planes over my neighborhood. When I moved into my house I knew about how many planes a day flew over it, but that could change and my traffic could be 5-6 times what it is now. That wouldn't make me an idiot for being upset with that.  The problem isn't just living close to the airport, it's the departure and approach paths that can be subject to change, mostly departures, as approaches are literally set in stone for the most part. Our airport is right near the geographic center of the metro area, there are lots of suburbs and surrounding areas that get plane traffic depending on the weather and flight paths.  So sure, feel free to rip on people who made poor decisions, and maybe some of them did. But just wanted to point out there are other factors."
TwinCities,3e2iuc,AngrySiouxBaru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:33 2015 UTC,They should have just built the airport in Rosemount instead of expanding MSP back in the day.  But that ship has long since sailed!
TwinCities,3e2iuc,bobpuller,4,Tue Jul 21 18:55:08 2015 UTC,"Some of the areas with the most noise are not that close to the airport.  I live in Keewaydin which is directly north of the airport and the planes were louder when I lived further away in Windom.  The planes are louder in Linden Hills then they are at my house.  So just saying, ""Don't be an idiot, you moved to a house across the street from the airport."" is a weak argument because a lot of people live miles away from the airport.  I knew airport noise would be an issue when I moved to Keewaydin but it was a pleasant surprise when it turned out that Keewaydin gets less noise than Southwest Minneapolis."
TwinCities,3e2iuc,matthewmpls,3,Tue Jul 21 15:47:21 2015 UTC,It's not really a weak argument. You live near a major city there's going to be noise from things like airports and other services offered by or near the city.  What do you want them to do? Stifle commerce and stop flying airplanes into the city?
TwinCities,3e2iuc,Minerminer1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:33 2015 UTC,"My point is that many people complaining about noise did not buy a house 1/2 a mile from the airport, they might live many miles away from the airport and flight paths have changed.  I am not one of the people complaining about the noise and I am not an aviation noise expert so I don't know what they can do to mitigate the noise.  I can empathize with people who live somewhere that is 4-5 miles away from the airport but can't have a conversation outside because the planes are so loud."
TwinCities,3e2iuc,matthewmpls,2,Tue Jul 21 17:01:48 2015 UTC,Yeah but they did buy a house near a major city. If you want to live without any noise go live out in the country. You can't have all the perks of living near a major city and then expect to be able to only hear nature sounds when you go outside.  Its not like these planes are cruising over their houses at 500 ft. A lot of these people like to complain just for the sake of complaining. As referenced in the article the whole reason they think complaints went up is because people are opening their windows with the nice weather. So noise they normally wouldn't hear because the AC is on and their windows are closed is now bugging them.
TwinCities,3e2iuc,Minerminer1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:07:59 2015 UTC,The planes do fly so low in Windom and Kingfield that you can't hear someone standing two feet away when you are outside and they also shake houses.  A lot of the complainers are over the top but a lot are also legitimate.    I agree that you can't complain about every noise when you live in the city.  But if no one ever complained about things improvement wouldn't happen.
TwinCities,3e2iuc,matthewmpls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:18:10 2015 UTC,"Some people have lived in their homes for quite a while...   At my old house in Edina, there were planes flying over every 10 minutes it seemed. Now that I'm in Hopkins, I never see or hear them."
TwinCities,3e2iuc,TheSuperDanks,3,Tue Jul 21 15:28:27 2015 UTC,Well Hopkins is farther from the airport than Edina... so that makes perfect sense.
TwinCities,3e2iuc,Minerminer1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:10 2015 UTC,like me :D
TwinCities,3e2iuc,Minerminer1,3,Tue Jul 21 16:42:58 2015 UTC,"I live by the airport. Realtor said there was very little noise when I bought the house. The airport built or used a different run way and now every once in awhile it gets really loud, house shakes. I think they use a different run way in the summer because that's the only time it gets really loud. I'm not complaining but it does suck sometimes. Looks like the planes are going to land on top of the V.A. Hospital sometimes."
TwinCities,3e2iuc,Gamagatsu74,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:15 2015 UTC,No they don't use a different runway in the summer. They use whichever runways they have to based on wind direction.
TwinCities,3e2iuc,Minerminer1,5,Tue Jul 21 16:42:41 2015 UTC,"Well, yes they use runways based on wind direction, but there are actually more 747s flying out of MSP in the summer (june-september I think?). Delta swaps out the 777 for a 747 in the summer on the direct flight to Japan.   Some of the 747 pilots like to use the longest runway possible (runway 4/22 - 11,000ft long) because they have a FULL frickin plane, which means they have to use the cross runway that goes right by the VA.  They also built a new runway in 2005 (17/35) which goes almost north and south. Airplanes are only allowed to land from the south and take off to the south on this runway because buildings are too close to the north.  Source: used to work at MSP"
TwinCities,3e2iuc,jjm3210,0,Tue Jul 21 17:12:59 2015 UTC,I haven't seen a 747 fly out of MSP in a long time. They're all supposed to be retired by 2017 so maybe that was more common in the past.
TwinCities,3e2iuc,Minerminer1,2,Tue Jul 21 17:49:52 2015 UTC,I've seen two this week. They still use them. I cheer when they fly over me to the chagrin of my wife. Such a cool piece of equipment.
TwinCities,3e2iuc,DeckardsKid,2,Tue Jul 21 19:13:48 2015 UTC,"I work right under the south approach/depart in Mendota Heights, right between the two main runways, there is a daily 747. I see it almost everyday at the same time. I think there's actually 3-4 dailies at times as well. There's also still some DC10/MD11 dailies that UPS and FedEx fly, even though I don't think those fly passenger traffic anymore at all anywhere in the world. There was also a A340 Air France flight, direct to Paris, added not to long ago, not sure if it's daily or bi-daily. But it's the only A340 I've ever seen here in Minnesota, and seen it quite a few times now.  Not to mention the An124s we get, and the extremely rare visit from the almighty An224. Plus we get some C-17s occasionally which are pretty big, and the C-5 if the president is coming to town.  So even sans a lot or 747s there's some bigger planes that come into MSP."
TwinCities,3e2iuc,AngrySiouxBaru,0,Tue Jul 21 18:02:29 2015 UTC,Yes all sorts of airplanes fly into MSP. Just not sure who the 747's you keep seeing are flying for.   The Delta flights to Japan are all done on the 777.
TwinCities,3e2iuc,Minerminer1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:49 2015 UTC,"There was a daily 747 but it was damaged in a flight in June. So they just recently brought another one out of retirement to put back into service, but probably not for use here except during overflow. I had to look it up to get a better answer...  http://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/news/2015/07/01/delta-boeing-747-msp-dtw-n671us-n664us.html  I was wrong about the daily flight, looks like that has since been cancelled. BUT, like the other guy said, it does state they still use them for high volumes. So he might be right about high volumes to NRT during peak travel season.  Also, Building C at the airport is one of the few hangars big enough to service 747s so it looks like Delta does that here as well. So the 747s I'm seeing are probably on the rare days a couple are coming in for repairs or high volume flights or something. But as early as just a couple months ago there was a daily arrival between like 4:00 - 4:30pm'ish. Perhaps it was only in the summer I was seeing them.  The old daily route the 747 flew was the MSP->NRT route though. So that's probably why that guy thought was still a daily. I honestly did too.  Unrelated side note: My mother was a flight attendant and flew that route decades ago, as well as others in Asian/SE Asia. I still have legit silverware that says ""Northwest Orient"" on it. Pretty cool stuff. Back when they didn't give a shit about weight and wasting fuel."
TwinCities,3e2iuc,AngrySiouxBaru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:30 2015 UTC,"That Air France A340 is once a day. They actually fly over there own fuellers from France every single day because they don't let the MSP guys touch the gauges, only hook up to it. The french guys are nice, though.  Also, the president flies in a 747. Check my post history for a picture of it."

They actually fly over there own fuellers from France every single day because they don't let the MSP guys touch the gauges, only hook up to it.   Are you a fueller? I know someone who works for ASIG at MSP, or whatever it's called know. Pretty funny Air France won't let the local fuelers touch their planes.  I know the president flies in a 747. Technically speaking, it's a VC-25, the military version of the 747 developed for use of transporting the president. Similar to how the KC-46 is basically a 767, or the KC-135 is basically a modified 707.  What I meant by the C-5 was if the President is in town, that carries the motorcade and even the Marine 1 helicopters if needed for the trip."
TwinCities,3e2iuc,AngrySiouxBaru,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:23 2015 UTC,Used to be.   That must explain the C-5 i saw there last summer! I remember driving by the fire station on the ramp and seeing the black motorcade cars inside the glass doors.

TwinCities,3e2iuc,Minerminer1,5,Tue Jul 21 14:26:23 2015 UTC,There are many people who moved to a neighborhood near the airport prior to it becoming the behemoth it is today. I believe they have a valid claim that the rapidly increasing noise level caused by the airport causes undue harm to not only their property value but also their health and well-being. I think you are being unnecessarily dismissive.
TwinCities,3e2iuc,ExcelSar,3,Tue Jul 21 13:43:10 2015 UTC,"And do you have stats on the number of people who moved next to the airport before it became a behemoth? Or do you happen to have the date when the airport became a behemoth?  You think I'm being dismissive, but I think you're being naive.

TwinCities,3e0d9e,varikin,3,Tue Jul 21 16:56:15 2015 UTC,I do this trip every year.
TwinCities,3e0d9e,So_Full_Of_Fail,2,Tue Jul 21 01:18:15 2015 UTC,"It's a better idea than me flying to Richmond, VA to buy a 41 year old car and driving it back here.  A car I had never actually seen in person."
TwinCities,3dxykj,Mpls_Is_Rivendell,26,Mon Jul 20 13:22:16 2015 UTC,"I went to school near Chicago, about 1 hour from the city limits by car, and seldom ventured downtown because of traffic and parking rates. Aside from having wayyy more people, there's also Lake Michigan, so density is geographically inflated.  Our population is less overall and our distribution is so good we even manage to have two separate downtowns.  So I don't really find anything wrong with the idea of a Minneapolis being a ""small"" city if your idea of a ""normal"" city is Chicago. Similarly, someone from Tokyo might find Chicago to be a nice little lakeside village."
TwinCities,3dxykj,jamesvg,17,Mon Jul 20 14:53:07 2015 UTC,"I have come to understand this after traveling to a lot of other cities for work.  There are very few large metropolitan areas that are as easy to navigate as Minneapolis (and St. Paul, for that matter). I can bike almost anywhere within the Minneapolis city limits in half an hour.  Could you imagine trying to bike from the north Bronx, to southern Brooklyn, or from Hollywood to Santa Monica?  The Twin Cities are pretty much the perfect size."
TwinCities,3dxykj,AbeRego,10,Mon Jul 20 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"The Twin Cities are pretty much the perfect size.     I have the same feelings after living/traveling all over the US.  My wife and I were talking about it over the weekend actually.  Smaller cities get so boring after a while I have found, and larger cities are a pain in the ass to navigate or have to much crime."
TwinCities,3dxykj,blah_blah_STFU,9,Mon Jul 20 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I've lived in large cities (Chicago, Vienna) and medium-sized cities (Nashville, Pittsburgh) and however-the-hell-you-categorize-the-Bay-Area and I'll take a medium-sized city like Minneapolis any day.  90% of the opportunities and resources of a large city with only a fraction of the hassles."

TwinCities,3dxykj,Hermosa06-09,2,Mon Jul 20 21:04:39 2015 UTC,"Mmm hmm, same feeling here. I went to school out east, and I spent enough time in Philadelphia to realize just how tiny the Metro area is here. Also, despite some of the really goofy streets, how easily navigable it is.  I'm kind of reminded of why I chose the school I did. It's big enough to have the benefits of a proper major metropolitan area, but small enough not to be completely lost and dehumanized by the enormity of it all."

It will be tiring, it will  be draining, but you'll also enjoy it. Especially because you're still a dang teenager.

This was the second time they had used S&S, and that was their only complaint about them, and since they have a neighbor with a chainsaw who can take care of this himself no one is really upset about it.  They did a good job on cleanup, too. I was at my parents' place the day after and there wasn't a spec of debris anywhere to be seen, aside from a few stray pine needles in the garden.

TwinCities,3dnjbx,1iI1iI1iI1iI,4,Fri Jul 17 20:17:55 2015 UTC,"On the weekend:  If you are taking 394 east and want to get on 94 east (and aren't exiting onto 35W or Hiawatha), but the ramp/tunnel traffic is a nightmare (it's a 7 day a week problem), you can instead stay on 394 into Downtown onto 6th Street.  Stay on 6th Street all the way through Downtown and you'll wind up on 94 east.  Downtown is empty on the weekend and you can get through it pretty quickly.  But watch out for special events."

TwinCities,3dnjbx,orbitalinterceptor,3,Sat Jul 18 06:52:35 2015 UTC,"Southbound 35W backs up around Washington in the mornings and lasts through the interchange with 94 before it picks back up. Since I get on at University and it'd be dangerous to hop over 3 lanes in such a short period of time during rush hour, I keep right when it splits and take the 94 west exit but effectively take the 35W ramp meant for people getting on from Washington to merge back on.

If you take 35W S from S 4th Ave downtown, take the outside left lane to merge onto the highway (then its just you vs bus and not you vs car vs bus, left lane dictates the zipper there.  yield to buses, fuck cars), stay in the far right lane, and after 52 connects ride that ""ending"" lane around the bend until it actually ends.  Easily 5-10 minutes ahead by this point.  Hang out in the right two lanes of 35W until 36th/38th up over that hill and weave back left when the car pool lane opens up, the left lanes bottleneck around that uphill left turn and don't catch back up until the car pool lane begins.  Then just hang out left.  If you time it right and you're going east on 494 you can get off on Bush Lake Rd, pop a U turn at the light, hop back on 494, and have your own private lane to Normandale."

Right now, to avoid 35W and the ramp to 94 I use Portland and Park to go north from 62 in Richfield, take it all the way up to River road (a one block jog west at the end of Park). Take River Road west to just past Broadway. That road then comes out at the Broadway ramp to 94.   More relaxing drive, and the river road has nicer scenery, especially the mobile scenery. :)  I work in Eagan.

TwinCities,3dirjl,C0ntents,3,Thu Jul 16 19:28:25 2015 UTC,"I have a question.  I often take the train from near the Vikings stadium to twins games.  Sometimes, the machines are so busy with out of towners that I miss the train.  One time, an officer just told me to buy it at the next stop and get back on.  Seemed a bit odd.  Would a fifty cent fare be enough to give a ticket or would that be a warning type scenario?"
TwinCities,3dirjl,pewpewberty,6,Fri Jul 17 07:30:52 2015 UTC,Yes. Even traveling within the downtown zone without full local fare or downtown fare would be considered fare evasion.   I would suggest purchasing a GoTo card and just hang onto that. It is pretty slick and if you are only using it for $0.50 rides it should last you awhile.

TwinCities,3dirjl,mrrp,3,Thu Jul 16 17:26:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, we track them in-house with our report writing system.  If you are stopped again without fare a check will be done that includes a check for warrants or any prior verbal warnings."

TwinCities,3dirjl,noaz,2,Thu Jul 16 20:44:51 2015 UTC,"I missed your AMA but I have a question:  I use a GoTo card, so the transfer info is built into that.  If I go somewhere on the Green Line, run my errand, and then come back and hit up the fare machine, it will note I'm on a transfer.  But if I'm outside of the 2 1/2 hour transfer timespan once I get off...would that be a warning or a ticket?  If I was using a paper card, I'd look at my watch, do the math, and get a new card.  (Coming from NYC and DC, I'm a fan of public transit, and I find MTA to be pretty affordable.)  But there doesn't seem to be an option for that with the GoTo.  I don't appear to be able to add a new fare, or is there a way to override the machine?"
TwinCities,3dirjl,autobahn,3,Thu Jul 16 21:01:15 2015 UTC,"Your transfer will be on the GoTo card for the 2.5 hours. If you get checked it will show us if you are or are not within your transfer period. If you are out of the transfer period the validator tells us your time has expired. We also can see when and where you lay used your card and on what machine. It all helps to determine outcome. Additionally, your prior contacts and officer discretion will determine a warning, ticket or arrest.   GoTo cards have a lot of options for refilling your stores value, to auto refill, monthly unlimited rides. The list goes on. You can find more at [GoTo Website](www.meteotransit.org/go-to-card)  At the website you can register your cards. Which helps a lot when it is stolen!! We can enter the card number to our ""hotlist"" and track it within the transit system and then do a investigation follow up by pulling video from the location the stolen card is used."

Use of this language can get you removed from the bus and your riding privileges canceled for 30 days.   Let's say someone drops the f-word in casual conversation, ""My fucking shoelace is fucking untied again, dang."" Under what statute could this be prosecuted? There's nothing in the transit statutes which would cover this, and I can't imagine a more general statute under which it could be (successfully) prosecuted.  What has your training been on this issue?  I avoided bringing my young children on public transit because of the foul language and general bad behavior of some of the riders. That said, I do not advocate changing laws (or the constitution) just because I want someone to not swear in front of my kids."
TwinCities,3dirjl,jordanjay29,7,Thu Jul 16 18:01:01 2015 UTC,"Occasionally we get calls to issues like this.   To answer your questions, probably the most applicable statue would be the 609.72(3)- Disorderly Conduct ""engages in offensive, obscene, abusive, boisterous, or noisy conduct or in offensive, obscene, or abusive language tending reasonably to arouse alarm, anger, or resentment in others.""  In this case, we would need a witness to complete a citizen arrest form to describe the behavior/language as it would be a misdemeanor not occurring in an officer's presence. Even if the suspect continued the obscene behavior in front of the officer,   the officer would still need a citizen to complete a form as the prosecuting attorney's have basically made it impossible for an officer to be ""offended"" by obscene behavior.... ""we should have thicker skin""  The transit policy you provided in your post refers to the trespass notice we can issue to persons for 30 days.  These can be issued by any transit supervisor or transit officer. Just like getting trespassed from a Target store for theft or a gas station for loitering."

TwinCities,3dirjl,mrrp,5,Thu Jul 16 19:46:22 2015 UTC,"To you.   I can agree with you that the language is vague.

TwinCities,3dirjl,mrrp,2,Thu Jul 16 20:06:16 2015 UTC,"It is perfectly constitutional for the government to place reasonable restrictions on speech, especially on less-protected speech, which includes profanity, obscenity, fighting words, etc.  It can't deny the speech everywhere, all the time, but in certain settings (like busses and trains) it certainly can.  It's the same basic reason why it's not unconstitutional to have a law against shouting ""fire!"" in a crowded theater.  As an aside, are you an attorney or law student?  You seem to be awfully confident about your position.  Just curious"
TwinCities,3dirjl,solla_bolla,0,Thu Jul 16 23:34:39 2015 UTC,"I understand there are limits to the first amendment. The question is whether public transportation (including platforms, stations, etc.) is (or should) be treated like a public sidewalk. What's the rationale for broad free speech rights on the public sidewalks? Are bus stops, subway platforms, and subway cars so different that an argument can't be made that they shouldn't be treated similarly?  Courts have ruled that transit providers have made at least some of their space a public venue (when they sell advertising space on the interior of subway cars or on the sides of buses, for example). Once they open the doors to speech, they must be even handed.  Yes, maybe turning the walls of the subway car into a free speech zone doesn't turn the entire car into one. Sure, I'd buy that. But what if metro transit took action to bring certain members of the public on board the public transit system to verbally spread a particular message to the other riders? Would that be enough for a court to determine that it's now a public venue? I think it's possible. And if you're wondering, yes, they do that with MAD DADS, a ""GOD-Fearing"" organization which has recruitment of men and influencing the spirituality of children, adolescents, and young adults among its stated goals. I can't see a (reasonable) judge allowing Metro Transit to endorse and allow MAD DADS while not allowing other groups the same right to spread their own message."
TwinCities,3dirjl,mrrp,2,Fri Jul 17 00:23:15 2015 UTC,"If you can't see a clear, logical distinction between the inside of a bus/train and an outside open sidewalk, then there's really no way to have an intellectual conversation on this point.  On a sidewalk you are free to leave an area and generally aren't in close proximity to people.  On a bus or train you are essentially a captive audience for the duration of your commute, thus certain reasonable speech restrictions are appropriate.  Besides, the Supreme Court has even upheld certain speech restrictions on sidewalks, including restrictions against solicitation (United States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720 (1990))  Beyond that, even your assertion about ad space on trains being a public venue is not technically correct.  The ad space is treated as commercial space and the government is free to exercise a degree of viewpoint-based discrimination in the selection of advertisements.    To the last point, I'm not sure what you mean by bringing people on board to spread a message.  I've never experienced anyone from MAD DADS onboard a bus or train, and I highly doubt there is any formal association between metro transit and a group like that (I welcome evidence to the contrary).  Even if there was, however, it still wouldn't take away from there ability to regulate profanity and obscene speech.  Theoretically, absent any other speech regulations, any group could come on board and say whatever they wanted as long as they didn't use profane or obscene language.  Your hypothetical involves a completely separate sort of speech restriction.  Another point is that the forum analysis and speech restriction applies the same to everyone.  If it's a closed forum, then it's treated that way for all groups.  The forum dictates the standard necessary to justify the rules, but the rules nonetheless apply to everyone equally.  If the rule is ""no profanity,"" it applies as much to MAD DADS or the bus driver as it does to you.  If a rule says ""no political speech,"" it applies as much to dems and it does to repubs.  If the rules have a compelling justification and apply to everyone, then they can pass constitutional muster."
TwinCities,3dirjl,solla_bolla,5,Fri Jul 17 01:09:39 2015 UTC,"It probably has more to do with public transit being a privilege and not a right. You can be barred from riding public transit if you create a nuisance (or as the above comments discussed, evade fares)."
TwinCities,3dirjl,jordanjay29,-9,Thu Jul 16 18:30:28 2015 UTC,"A government agency can not bar you from public transit for exercising a constitutional right. There can not be a policy which says that it's perfectly fine to say ""Dang, my darn shoelace is untied again."" but not ""Fuck, my fucking shoelace is untied again.""

TwinCities,3di1dy,Eternlgladiator,19,Thu Jul 16 13:17:41 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of the complaints, from the article, is the increase in traffic during off-hours, but with a decrease in total flights:  In the first six months of the year, departures and arrivals between 10:30 p.m. and 6 a.m. increased by 13 percent. That is particularly notable because the overall number of flights is trending down. In the same six-month comparison, total flights decreased by 3 percent.   So, I'd say they are just bitching about this more than just the existence of the airport.  If these numbers are accurate, the complaint to address this particular problem is valid."
TwinCities,3di1dy,agressiv,3,Thu Jul 16 14:02:30 2015 UTC,Complaining won't change anything here.   Complaining has changed a lot about the airport in the past 20 years and poured millions of dollars into soundproofing homes most affected by the airport noise. The airport commission knew when they chose to greatly expand the airport in the early 1990s instead of re-build it south of the city they were going to have to deal with residents for basically forever. It cuts both ways.
TwinCities,3di1dy,nwnokomis,8,Thu Jul 16 16:49:08 2015 UTC,"That seems. . .defeatist.   It seems like there are many possible options. Preferentially use runways so that takeoffs and landings come in / out over commercial or industrial zones (e.g. the mall, the river, the wetlands surrounding the river) rather than residential.   Increase the speed of ascent and descent.   Or, decrease total speed to reduce engine volume, if not time over houses."
TwinCities,3di1dy,forever_erratic,9,Thu Jul 16 14:07:32 2015 UTC,"It's not defeatist, it's realist.  They choose runways based on wind directions not by which neighborhood they fly over.  These people should have done their homework before buying a home near the airport.  It's not like it was hidden."
TwinCities,3di1dy,Eternlgladiator,3,Thu Jul 16 14:12:33 2015 UTC,"It's not that simple. Certain wind directions and speeds allow use of multiple runways. Forever_erratic listed a few other mitigations.   Over the years, the complaining has been the motivation for lots of improvements."
TwinCities,3di1dy,rigtenzin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:24:26 2015 UTC,"It's defeatist because you act like absolutely nothing can be done. This is not a binary situation; steps can be taken to reduce noise, even if nothing will fully remove noise."
TwinCities,3di1dy,forever_erratic,4,Thu Jul 16 14:22:33 2015 UTC,"It's not that nothing can be done but why should the airport that serves a whole region move a couple flights a day because the entitled folks of south Minneapolis don't like the noise.  It's been there.  It will be there.  They knew or should have know what they were getting into.  Why is it so surprising that volume has increased or flight schedules change.  It is a business after all and they're just working to keep it rolling.  I can't imagine moving to an area near an airport and thinking ""this is alright, I'm sure it'll be quieter in a few years or at least it'll never get worse"".  That's like moving near a landfill and hoping the smell improves.  These people lied to themselves about the zip code they were moving to and now they don't want to live with the consequences of those actions."
TwinCities,3di1dy,Eternlgladiator,3,Thu Jul 16 14:51:41 2015 UTC,"This is what I don't get. When they bought their in home whatever year did they just assume, ""ohh yeah, it's kinda loud but there are only so many flights, planes won't get any bigger, and there is no chance of flight schedules changing so there wont be more flights at night"".   It's an airport in a quickly growing metro area. The flights are gonna become more frequent, they are gonna happen at different times more often, planes will get bigger and louder just like the Cities in general. People need to have some foresight."
TwinCities,3di1dy,QuixoticViking,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:52:35 2015 UTC,I think the problem is that if you have a wind out of the west to north all departures are going to go over South Minneapolis to some extent. Aircraft can only climb so quickly so they might be able to mitigate but maybe not.
TwinCities,3di1dy,JohannTheGuard,3,Thu Jul 16 17:10:39 2015 UTC,Yeah it's really not that bad. Some planes are louder than others but even the loudest aren't enough to wake me up at night.
TwinCities,3di1dy,TedsEmporiumEmporium,2,Thu Jul 16 14:03:50 2015 UTC,"When I moved in a number of years ago, the plane noise wasn't quite so bad and they didn't fly over my house as frequently. More concerning to me is the amount of vibration from the planes overhead. I live right next to light rail, and there is little noise and no shaking *from the trains. The airplanes sometimes rattle the dishes in my cupboard."

TwinCities,3dhogi,WIGGLE_DINOSAUR,5,Thu Jul 16 10:52:54 2015 UTC,"Good luck there. My experience with Comcast in St. Paul was price increases every six months, long wait times for routine support calls (30 minutes today makes sense when there was a larger issue, but I'm talking every time I just wanted to discuss my bill), and frequent drops in connectivity. I also owned my router, which was better than the one they were offering, and got robo-calls every few weeks asking me to ""upgrade"" to their equipment, which they would have happily leased to me. After canceling, they wanted me to return ""their"" equipment, because their records still didn't show that I owned it. The person on the phone tried to tell me that I should have been paying a leasing fee every month and she didn't know how I'd been getting away with it, but that didn't mean I could just keep ""their"" equipment.   CenturyLink has been cheaper and more responsive. I'll deal with the two hours from 4 to 6 AM that it was down today if it means that Comcast doesn't get my money."

TwinCities,3de3wc,Mpls_Is_Rivendell,15,Wed Jul 15 22:24:37 2015 UTC,"Lol.   South metro construction problems!   North metro traffic problems just rarely get funded.  If ever.   Look at Hwy 169 alone:  new river bridge in '96, two phases of construction to replace stoplights with overpasses,  and then construction to rebuild the 169/494 interchange.   How many hundreds of millions did that freeway to the exurbs get alone?   I'm not saying it wasn't necessary,  it just illustrates where the money gets spent.  Hwy 100 in the north metro only had their stoplights removed in '06.  In the south metro,  that happened in the late 1960's.  In short: quit complaining..  You've got it good."
TwinCities,3de3wc,mattsoca,5,Wed Jul 15 19:10:29 2015 UTC,"169 has gotten lots of upgrades in the north metro in the past 20 years too. They redid the Anoka bridge in '96, replaced the Devil's Triangle (which was the most dangerous intersection in the state) and replaced stoplights at 93rd and MN-610 with overpasses. Those were all large and expensive projects in the north metro."
TwinCities,3de3wc,kradlayor,3,Wed Jul 15 21:38:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying road construction doesn't exist..  The north metro gets a crumb here or there.   Devils triangle is a great one to bring up.   It was delayed and the money purposed for it was routed to continue work on hwy 62 instead (legislature failed to pass a transportation funding bill).   Compare hwy 65 thru Blaine to hwy 77 thru Apple Valley.   65 has two lanes,  77 has 3 and 4.   Anoka has passed a halt on business permits along hwy 10 because of how bad traffic currently is..  And that hwy isnt even out of planning stages yet: its been the same 2 lanes plus stoplights for 40 years..  And think of the population growth that has occured in Coon Rapids,  Anoka,  Ramsey,  and Elk River over those four decades.  Now imagine how long it will take to complete planning,  get funding,  acquire right of way,  and complete construction.   It might be this way for another ten plus years.   I've been using these roads for 40 years as my job and I can honesty tell you there is a very real and concrete difference in the funding north and south of 394.  Just my opinion.   All my best!"

One thing I'll say about LA and ATL: they are super nice.  You put your blinker on and people will back off and make room for you to merge into a lane.

They'll tear it all up again, but they could just do it right the first time.  100 could use an extra lane, 394 as well.  Turn the reversible portion in to normal lanes.  Give an extra lane on the 394 to 94 eastbound tunnel.  I could go on."

Now they finally have money, a bunch of backlogged projects are being pushed though to use the money before the state changes their minds.  I'm sure MNDOT isn't innocent here - but don't blame them for things they can't control.  Either way, I'm glad I ride the bus now. Traffic infuriates me when I drive."
TwinCities,3de3wc,ITRAINEDYOURMONKEY,4,Thu Jul 16 04:57:30 2015 UTC,"And every time you add a lane, congestion will just build up until you add another lane and it keeps going. Adding lanes is a solution in a small number of cases. Overall, it is not good practice."

Sitting on traffic makes you miserable, fat and burns a lot of gas.  I'm sure I'll get a ton of reasons why you can't bike, but seriously, if you complain about the traffic this much, either bike to work, move closer to work, or just shut the fuck up about it.

This year the west metro has it very bad while the east metro (except for the multi-year bridge projects on 35E & 52) is pretty quiet.  If your commute involves multiple major routes, sometimes it just happens where both routes have simultaneous but unrelated major construction projects.  That happened to me in 2010 and I wound up taking a much longer (but faster) alternate route all summer long."

So many people on the Star Tribune would say ""just use 94"" but MNDoT was well aware just 1 road to Wisconsin would be way too inadequate. They've done traffic studies on that section of 94 so I'm thinking 2017 that cloverleaf in Woodbury will be taken out and fly-overs put in. You will notice that for 1 mile on either side it is only paved in asphalt instead of the 60 year concrete on the rest of 494/694. You know that is because they just planned on tearing it up soon."

TwinCities,3ddvil,porygon4,10,Wed Jul 15 14:34:53 2015 UTC,"Start with Surly Hell. It's most likely the easiest to approach. As you like Shock Top and Blue Moon, check out CynicAle. It's a bit more full flavored and has a bigger black pepper spice to it, but the style is similar.  Doomtree is very approachable also. Offers wonderful flavor but isn't over the top where those first looking to craft will be overwhelmed.  Mild is another great one, as is Bitter Brewer.   Merica! is a pre-Prohibition style lager so it will be more along the lines of those lagers you're familiar with.  Cacao Bender is the one that got my mom to start exploring craft beer after being just a wine and mixed drinks person her whole life. The cacao and vanilla beans are magic and are easy to get use to for even the non-craft drinkers.  Try a bit of everything. You never know what you may find that suits you. Keep trying new things and you will continue to expand your tastes. Soon you may be looking for the heavier hitters too."

With the addition of allowing breweries to serve food (like Surly), it's harder to distinguish between brewery and brewpub in Minnesota. Sadly brewpubs have far more limited laws. They can't sell their product outside the single brewpub location (for example, Town Hall can only sell growlers at 1 of their 3 locations) and they can't sell to bars. This is something many have fought hard to change (and why Barley John's ultimately built their $10 million brewery in Wisconsin instead of in Minnesota as John had wanted). We'll see if better brew pub laws happen in coming years but it seems most don't feel like fighting for the few brew pubs when the breweries have been getting all the glamour lately."

It's a new place, and you're trying new beers. I don't mind admitting I've never tried this one beer brewed by this one place.   I don't know much about their beer, and my taste is kind of specific. I usually drink beers like Blue Moon, Shock Top, Newcastle, and Stella.   I hate to tell you this, but I don't know if you're going to like Surly. It's much more bitter and hoppier than any of those beers. The Hefe/Wheat beer will probably be the best.  Just consult the menu, they have a pretty decent description of what they got. Oh, and if you don't like spicy, avoid the Fiery Hell. It's got quite a bit of heat to it."

However, in this particular case what bothered me is that I was sitting there on the ground, covered in brake dust, grease, and brake fluid, at least 20 of my tools within arms reach, 4 boxes of new parts, the tire off, and the entire braking system apart, and not a man in sight when this guy walked up. It was painfully obvious who had taken it apart. Simple deductive reasoning would show that I must know at least somewhat what I'm doing. He then stood there for 30 min or so, trying to boss me around, tell me how to do it, what wrench size he thought I needed, and asking me where my husband/boyfriend was, and why wasn't he doing it for me. It was unbelievably annoying, and totally uncalled for.  I think it's AWESOME that So many people stopped and checked to see if I was okay, or even asked if I needed a hand. And I love that they did.

I also remember hearing the City of St Paul owns the lights. Transit owns the light rail stuff. And Ramsey county manages some of the bigger roads (Snelling etc)   As far as any ongoing updates I have no idea what the plan is. If anyone is looking for a one-way trip getting less than 45-50 minutes on the green line, you are probably dreaming. The speed limits of the train, the inability to get up to speed and put in crossing arms in the dense urban area the green line finds itself is not going to change. The green line neighborhood is very different than the blue line."

TwinCities,3d4wsp,mrblaq,7,Tue Jul 14 15:50:11 2015 UTC,"Dayton doesn't really have a say in the matter. The traffic engineers have the job of continuing to model and check timing. Chances are if they aren't changing things, it's because they've found that doing so would cause other issues. I complain about them too but they really know far better what changing a single light will cause for the greater system.  Source: sister-in-law does traffic simulations for the city of St Paul.  If you live in Minneapolis, use the 311 app. It can be used to report a light or intersection you believe has bad timing. They'll look into it and see if this is true. Keep in mind that generally they just find that it's correct but I have seen a couple instances where they've made modifications."

TwinCities,3d4wsp,tanis7x,2,Mon Jul 13 20:05:15 2015 UTC,"My father complains about these sorts of things literally every time I'm in a car with him.  Sensing cars: If an intersection is busy enough to have a stoplight in the first place, I think they just assume that the ability to sense cars will be used so infrequently that it wouldn't be worth the cost. That said, some intersections do have them but they don't switch the light immediately or the sensor is a few car-lengths back.  Linking multiple lights together: I know of plenty of places where this is done, but you have to understand that it can only work in one direction on a given street.  Yield lights at night: If I had to guess, I'd say they don't do this because people can't handle yellow flashing lights.  They don't know what it means."

The only thing I don't like, and this has happened mostly on the light rail, is that there seems to always be at least one person/group that ruins the whole experience. For example, one time it was a group of young girls literally yelling and trying to physically fight each other, another time is was some lady screaming obscenities into her phone. I see many transit officers waiting on the platforms but I never see any on the actual train. So my question is, do you guys ever go on the train to maintain a presence there, or no? What should I do in these situations? Is it just going to have to be a deal with it situation because there are always crazies? It just makes me hesitant to ride the train sometimes at night or by myself because it can be that uncomfortable. Thanks!"
TwinCities,3d4wsp,BeerNoggin,28,Mon Jul 13 15:43:36 2015 UTC,"First of all welcome to the Twin Cities.  Sorry about some of your experiences on the LRV being frustrating.  I know it can be annoying seeing obnoxious groups board the LRV, cause a ruckus and depart many times before a transit officer is able to respond.  My suggestion would be to contact the operator of the train as quickly as possible via the in car emergency call boxes.  Often times people forget about these and/or don't view it as a true ""emergency"". The truth is, this is the fastest way to get the information to transit officers to respond.  By calling 911 your phone call would be sent to the closest 911-communication center, then transferred to transit dispatch then to a transit officer. We still have a 911 dispatch center, it just is often transferred in much like State patrol, airport PD, U of M PD etc.   Now I realize you wouldn't want to draw attention to yourself talking into the emergency box and possibly become a victim yourself.  But if possible, you can quickly switch LRV cars while stopped at the platforms. That is how the transit officers check car by car, we quickly jump between cars at the platforms.   Which brings me to my final point.... Transit Cops on the LRVs.  Yes, we are on the trains.  The administration and auditing department have strategically staffed and placed officers throughout the light rail during the entire day. Speaking about the green line, we spend a lot of time near the U of M campus during the morning hours.  Between Snelling and downtown St. Paul in the afternoon.  And between Lexington and downtown in the evening hours. But able to respond to the entire line/platforms during our shifts if we can get to our squad cars.  If we can't then a patrol unit swoops in a takes the call from their patrol unit.  We typically check fares on a couple dozen train cars throughout our shift while our patrol car is parked near a station along the rail line.  Additional calls for service, bookings at jail, evidence and reports all can't be done on the light rail or at the platforms; so although we are assigned as a light rail car we might be in a marked squad during those tasks.    I hope you enjoy the LRV."
TwinCities,3d4wsp,ickypickle,29,Mon Jul 13 15:59:42 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is something that Metro Transit has publicly discussed before, but a text message system for riders would be amazing.  I know that the FCC is pushing text-to-911, but I'm not sure if that would extend to Metro Transit. Some stadiums also have a program where you can text a section and seat number to security if there is someone being unruly near you.  A system like this would eliminate the need to use the conspicuous emergency phone boxes, though identifying the train might be a little more work."

TwinCities,3d4wsp,jamesvg,8,Wed Jul 15 09:27:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah this happens a lot. People with their phones paying music loudly. People arguing or talking loudly. People putting feet on the seats, or spreading their belongings all over around them. Last week a guy rode his bike onto the train and sat on his bike, in the middle of the aisle, for his entire ride. He even initially refused to move for a blind man with a dog, before moving just enough to let him sit.   There needs to be more policing on the trains, plain and simple. A visible presence would really help these issues. The light rail is at a point where it could start turning away people who would like to ride it. My mom is already becoming nervous about riding it certain times of the day, and she's very pro-public transit. If this continues, it will become another city bus that most people turn their noses up at."
TwinCities,3d4wsp,leiftheviking87,17,Mon Jul 13 17:31:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. I agree with some of the issues you have noticed. The department is actively working on staffing levels. And we have had a LOT of hiring in the past two years.   Although there is always room for improvement, I hope you are noticing more cops on or near the transit system/vehicles.   Here is an article that was in Sunday's paper this past weekend that speaks about the staffing and hiring at MTPD.   article"
TwinCities,3d4wsp,leiftheviking87,6,Mon Jul 13 18:24:07 2015 UTC,Is Bob Thunder still with transit or did he retire?
TwinCities,3d4wsp,wookiee42,10,Mon Jul 13 16:26:54 2015 UTC,Before my time.  He has retired.  Lots of stories tho.

TwinCities,3d4wsp,DiscordianStooge,19,Mon Jul 13 18:11:45 2015 UTC,I heard about this. We got a chuckle from it at roll call.   I am cool with it if you cover your dairy-aire and pay your fare!!!
TwinCities,3d4wsp,DiscordianStooge,2,Mon Jul 13 18:13:13 2015 UTC,So I can let the front flap in the breeze?
TwinCities,3d4wsp,yahoo12,15,Mon Jul 13 18:55:55 2015 UTC,"Couldn't make the ""front flap"" fit into my rhyme. Haha. Just use common sense and remember kids and families ride the train too. Have fun!"
TwinCities,3d4wsp,anneboat,6,Mon Jul 13 19:21:02 2015 UTC,"When I've paid via GoTo and someone on the Green Line is doing a fares check, what is the best possible way to satisfy the check without wasting anyone's time?  Should I have my card ready and out?  How can I best identify my family that have fares through the card?  E.g. [Flashes card] ""Two adult fares and two under-5."""
TwinCities,3d4wsp,findinthesea,9,Mon Jul 13 17:37:38 2015 UTC,We prefer the actual card to be out. The validator reads it best this way. And when we scan it the screen makes it pretty noticeable that more than one fare is on it. I feel like I notice it most of the time when more or one fare was added to the GoTo card.

TwinCities,3d4wsp,heathenyak,4,Mon Jul 13 22:36:03 2015 UTC,I've always wondered how transit police patrol bus stops.  What do you do if you see suspicious activity away from the bus stop? Is there a certain radius? What if a major crime happens on a bus and the person isn't caught immediately - what role does your department take?
TwinCities,3d4wsp,intercomnut,9,Mon Jul 13 19:41:02 2015 UTC,"We generally are looking at our bus stops as we patrol. It is taught to us as we go through training. That doesn't mean we don't respond to stuff that is happening right in front of us. We are police just like the city police. It would be unusual for a transit cop to respond to a theft from a garage report call, but it could happen. We have arrest powers within the 9 county metro area and a joint powers agreement between Minneapolis and St Paul PDs."
TwinCities,3d4wsp,squarepeg0000,3,Mon Jul 13 20:57:53 2015 UTC,What is the justification for separating the transit police force from the regular police force?  What relationship do you have with Metro Transit?
TwinCities,3d4wsp,intercomnut,7,Mon Jul 13 17:58:20 2015 UTC,"We work for Metro Transit.   I am not sure what ""justification"" would be.  We started at as agency that only had part time officers (that worked full-time with another agency).  With the growth of the transit system the department became full-time in the 90s.    You can read more about the police department here.   Website"
TwinCities,3d4wsp,Hermosa06-09,2,Mon Jul 13 18:01:10 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a conflict of interest.  If I was hit by a bus or train, the police department that would investigate it would be owned by one of the parties involved?"
TwinCities,3d4wsp,squarepeg0000,3,Mon Jul 13 18:13:11 2015 UTC,"I am not involved in a bus accident. I just type a report. Although the department  falls under the umbrella of metro transit, I have never felt that played an affect on any investigation.   Actually, our accident reconstruction team is really well know within the metro area for any fatal or injury accidents. As recent as last week they worked that pedestrian fatal vs bus in Minneapolis. All accidents are reported just like any other crash with a police report and accident report. Any MTPD squad involved accident is investigated by State Patrol."
TwinCities,3d4wsp,mrfeature,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:30:25 2015 UTC,Are there any resources that would contain statistics regarding who was determined as being at fault in accidents involving Metro Transit vehicles?
TwinCities,3d4wsp,jordanjay29,3,Mon Jul 13 18:46:31 2015 UTC,I am sure there are. But I would not have a clue where to start looking for them.
TwinCities,3d4wsp,vivithemage,3,Mon Jul 13 19:22:43 2015 UTC,If you are hit by a City of Minneapolis vehicle the crash will be investigated by the MPD. It's no different. Metro Transit is a government organization.
TwinCities,3d4wsp,vivithemage,4,Mon Jul 13 21:25:36 2015 UTC,"The justification is that Metro Transit covers multiple cities and counties, and it's easier to have a dedicated police force for the transit system than to expect every city to patrol the trains/busses and try and coordinate between multiple departments."
TwinCities,3d4wsp,vivithemage,3,Mon Jul 13 21:23:45 2015 UTC,"As a UofM student, can we ride the green line from campus to campus for free?"
TwinCities,3d4wsp,Aram_Fingal,3,Tue Jul 14 00:15:37 2015 UTC,"yeah I got my pass in coffman last year for free, you just have to show your student ID there. The transit police do check to make sure you have the pass, though. Most mornings they'd be waiting on the platform to check people coming through."
TwinCities,3d4wsp,jondraws,2,Tue Jul 14 04:09:40 2015 UTC,If you have a UMN transit card
TwinCities,3d4wsp,jondraws,2,Tue Jul 14 02:01:51 2015 UTC,"Add if that is the pass that lists only a few stops on it, it is only good between those listed stops. If you want to travel outside of your campus area with that card you will have to buy a full transfer."
TwinCities,3d4wsp,Senatorweims16,7,Tue Jul 14 14:20:44 2015 UTC,"Not really policing-related, but are the trains cleaned at all? I've noticed over the years they are just grubby, dingy and seem to go days/weeks without a proper cleaning, let alone trash removal. What has your observation been?"
TwinCities,3d4wsp,Senatorweims16,10,Mon Jul 13 15:50:31 2015 UTC,"Yes the trains are cleaned.  Blue line LRVs go to the RCC (Rail Communications Center) near Franklin Platform.  Green Line LRVs go to the OMF (Operations Maintence Facility) near the new CHS Field in DT St. Paul.  As Transit police, we are probably the Transit employees within the passenger area of the vehicles the most while it is out on the tracks.  Any bio-hazard cleanup is advised immediately (you should see the bar close train leaving Warehouse platform some nights....).  If it is really bad and contaminated, the LRV will be taken out of service.    At the respective facilities where LRVs are housed, we do have a detailing area where the trains are super cleaned.  Not sure how often it happens tho..."
TwinCities,3d4wsp,Cassieisnotclever,7,Mon Jul 13 16:03:19 2015 UTC,In what scenarios does Metro Transit simply put up caution tape?
TwinCities,3d4wsp,Cassieisnotclever,9,Mon Jul 13 16:54:10 2015 UTC,Vomit.  The red stuff is super duper floor dry.  Gross I know.  But usually this was assessed by a rail supervisor and that was the decision they made.  Police didn't put up that tape.
TwinCities,3d4wsp,real-dreamer,8,Mon Jul 13 17:03:12 2015 UTC,"Odd, I had the exact opposite though.  Being originally from Chicago, the train system here seems WAY cleaner."
TwinCities,3d4wsp,real-dreamer,6,Mon Jul 13 17:03:10 2015 UTC,Have ridden the trains in Chicago and New York and Atlanta. You can practically eat off any surface in the light rail trains here in comparison.
TwinCities,3d4wsp,plsenjy,4,Tue Jul 14 03:09:30 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, the LRVs and buses in our system are extremely clean in a vacuum, but especially compared to other systems."
TwinCities,3d4wsp,colechristensen,5,Mon Jul 13 20:18:17 2015 UTC,Do you know if there are any plans to add a park and ride lot on University Ave in the midway area? I've parked in open lots close to stations but worry that I may be ticketed or towed.
TwinCities,3d4wsp,plsenjy,7,Mon Jul 13 16:14:56 2015 UTC,"I have always mentioned this to family and friends asking to travel to twins games/concerts etc. I find it frustrating that no park and rides where included with the Green Line.   Who knows if they have plans to add some? It sure would be nice! I know a few people park on the very north end of Targets parking lot near Hamline and then use the train. Although this might work for a few hours, maybe even the entire day for commuting, I wouldn't park there overnight. I don't think transit owns any of those lots. So it is kind of a park at your own risk.   Hopefully they have plans to get a park and ride in the future. It would really be useful to green line passengers."
TwinCities,3d4wsp,thirdstreetzero,2,Mon Jul 13 16:21:58 2015 UTC,Metro Transit has a policy (not sure if it's formal or not) against putting Park and Rides in Minneapolis or Saint Paul. The space is far too valuable and it costs too much money to build and maintain them when there's a lot of walk-up ridership.
TwinCities,3d4wsp,thirdstreetzero,2,Mon Jul 13 20:45:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a similar reason why they sold off the P&R at Lake Street.  The station is already well-connected and the land is valuable. I believe something is being built where the parking lot was."
TwinCities,3d4wsp,balierdis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:06:24 2015 UTC,It appears that is the case...and it makes sense.
TwinCities,3d4wsp,jakjg,4,Mon Jul 13 22:39:38 2015 UTC,"Not a question, but I am moving to the twin cities in a month an I am looking forward to utilizing the Light Rail. Thanks for doing this AMA, I hope there are some good questions."
TwinCities,3d4wsp,findinthesea,2,Mon Jul 13 16:17:15 2015 UTC,What has been your most rewarding experience working MTPD? Most harrowing? Thanks for your service.
TwinCities,3d4wsp,indolent02,10,Mon Jul 13 18:43:28 2015 UTC,"Most rewarding would probably being able to reunite a little boy with his family at one of the events in downtown during the All Star Game week last summer.   Or going on top of our rail facility near CHA field, gathering the batting practice baseballs that were hit up there and tossing them down to a kid walking the concourse within the stadium. We are maybe 6-8 ft above the fans as they walk around. It is even better when we can drop the ball to the child and the parents didn't even notice it.   That was cool.   Most harrowing? Not sure. My department has a huge area to cover even though we mostly work within the downtown areas. But last summer and this past winter with Officer Patrick's killing and Minneapolis Officer Davis getting shot, MTPD was on scene on both of those calls within a few minutes. I hope to never have to do either of those calls again. But to be a part of those calls is something. I think it shapes an officer and reminds us all of the reality of this job.     And you are welcome! :-)"
TwinCities,3d4wsp,tsaylor83,2,Mon Jul 13 19:03:45 2015 UTC,"Have you worked for any other law enforcement agency? Do you just take metro transit calls, or can you assist with local Minneapolis PD?"

TwinCities,3d4wsp,inyourface_milwaukee,2,Mon Jul 13 21:15:03 2015 UTC,"I almost always feel safe on the bus or train, but around the stops/stations it's another story.  Downtown St. Paul is what I see the most, though I'm typically not a passenger in that context, just a pedestrian.  I really feel like an on-foot police presence would be helpful and I literally never see that.  What's currently being done to improve safety and reduce crime in and around stops/stations?  Since that doesn't seem adequate, what else could be done?  What could be done to improve the sense of safety?"

TwinCities,3d4wsp,jakjg,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:33:28 2015 UTC,"This is probably a dumb question, but I've always been genuinely curious. Do you guys have the power/authority to make stops/arrests of people that aren't riding public transportation? For an example, if one of your patrol cars sees someone speeding or run a red light or something, can they pull them over and ticket them? Or does the transit police only have authority over the metro transit system?"
TwinCities,3d4wsp,findinthesea,5,Mon Jul 13 20:36:22 2015 UTC,"We have police powers like any other officer with in the cities/counties. Although it is common to only deal with transit related issues. We can pull you over. We can give speeding tickets, headlight tickets etc. we can do DWIs and we can go to addresses and deal with calls there. Generally we don't unless the city department is overrun and needs our help. But yes. We are police just like any other police officer."
TwinCities,3d4wsp,jakjg,0,Mon Jul 13 20:52:05 2015 UTC,That's what I figured. So don't run a yellow turning red light in front of you. Check.

TwinCities,3d4wsp,nervousanon,2,Tue Jul 14 02:31:07 2015 UTC,I think the chief explains it appropriately and how the situation went from just a citation to an arrest.

Honestly; last time I was there there was blood all over the platform (yes, I have pictures). It's regularly splattered with puke. Entire thing is an ash tray. Does anyone expect it to be a safe place when it's constantly in such disarray?"
TwinCities,3d4wsp,theDUDE8370,3,Tue Jul 14 04:54:34 2015 UTC,I can't speak specifically on what is going on there. But I can share some thoughts that might contribute to the problem.   In school they taught us a theory called CPTED (crime prevention through environmental design). Lake street is a perfect example of what not to do...   From the all glass panels that were once decor and on the outter most walls of the station. To the ample bedrock of stones laying near the tracks begging to be thrown at said glass. To the raised off the street level platform (out of the public eye). It all breeds trouble.   Added to that is just how busy that station is in general. It probably doesn't help things.   Here is a research article that focuses on Metro DC police and the creation of their transit system and how much of the CPTED theory was created from their engineering and thinking ahead of the curve on any trouble that might arise.   http://www.popcenter.org/library/crimeprevention/volume_06/05_nancy.pdf
TwinCities,3d4wsp,nervousanon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:58:21 2015 UTC,"It's a shame. I can't bring myself to use the station.

TwinCities,3d4wsp,TheMacMan,14,Mon Jul 13 17:01:02 2015 UTC,All platforms and trains are PAID FARE ZONES.  And you can be checked at any time. I believe the fine jumped up a little recently.  Not sure. I usually just say $200 bucks.

I've seen plenty of people walk onto the platform without scanning or buying a ticket."
TwinCities,3d4wsp,cazique,7,Mon Jul 13 17:26:54 2015 UTC,Don't forget that Metro Transit often runs a promotion where you ride free with a game ticket -- people leaving the Target Center and hopping on a train without scanning or buying a ticket might be doing that legally.

TwinCities,3d9l5r,automator3000,3,Tue Jul 14 17:54:53 2015 UTC,"FFG Game Center is in Roseville near Roseville Center and is hopping every night of the week.  Lots of good gaming to be had, and decent food.  Level Up Games is in South St Paul and has a great Magic the Gathering crowd.  The Source is in Roseville across from Har Mar and usually has a good mix of gaming going on.  Mead Hall is near Loring Park downtown and has a very hip 20-something crowd.  Dreamer's Den is down by Minnehaha Falls and usually has some kind of events going on.  Universe Games is in Uptown and is easy to get to if you're stuck with public transit only."

Republic is a bar, but serves food, so I think as long as you're not at the bar proper, you're OK to be inside. I'm bringing a stack of 20-odd games, primarily light-to-medium Euros, but a good enough variety.  But every place /u/meatwhisper noted is great for gaming. FFG is really good, though I wish I could transplant it to be not in the suburbs. Huge library of games in a wide, bright space."

Bloomington is 15 minutes driving from downtown unless you're way south in the quiet suburbs, and you've got access to a light rail that, the same hipsters who just hated on Bloomington obsessively ranted about building. We also have some great bus service. Uber is another option that won't be prohibitively expensive.   I'm a new transplant here and it's quite the town, especially if you like good beer and hearty, often bland food. Welcome to Minnesota!  edit: if you like drinking on a rooftop, Brit's is awesome. Not much of a dancer/club type but Surly is also wonderful if you're into large brewery spaces. Sunday brunch + trivia at Amsterdam in St. Paul is worth it too. They have a $5 Bloody Mary bar for your hangover hair of the dog.  Double edit: rent a car. Many of the best views and food of the city are accessible from places technically in other cities.

Malls are privately owned buildings, and those who are ""just there for the A/C"" can, and should, be asked to leave for loitering. It's like saying the burger king down the street is a ""public cooling center"". This then puts the county in a bad light, as they stated the mall is a public center when it indeed is not.

It has seen precipitation increase by almost 40 percent since 1958, a trend expected to continue. Drought here will also continue to worsen.  Yes of course the Twin Cities will be warmer than the rural area.

TwinCities,3d1vnu,rickdias,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:13:29 2015 UTC,"Published On July 12, 2015 | By Defend Glendale   So obviously this isn't an impartial report. It's a published statement.  So, for proper reporting, I'm going to turn to actual journalists.   Following months of protests, residents of Glendale Townhomes, a public housing complex in Minneapolis’ Prospect Park Neighborhood, are claiming victory after pushing back city plans to demolish and privatize their community.   And is privatization necessarily a bad thing? I'd hazard a guess that more than 80% of the metro area's rental properties are privately owned.  In fact, if we look at this reporting, it might even be a good thing.   Barbra Muhammad is ready for the Glendale Townhomes in the Prospect Park area of Minneapolis to be torn down and redeveloped.  The resident of the 63-year-old public housing row houses has grown tired of wet basements and a pervasive rodent problem.   Later reporting also revealed more information:   The key points made at nearby Luxton Park by those trying to sell that project: No public housing units will be lost in the redevelopment; anyone forced to move temporarily will get federal relocation benefits with a right of return; the new public housing units will be bigger and nicer; and they’ll be perpetually subsidized.   So what more do they want? Yes, they may have to temporarily relocate, but the place sounds like it's in such a condition that rebuilding parts of the complexes is the only long-term solution. These aren't historic homes, like the James J. Hill House or something, it's subsidized housing, and it sounds like at this point the maintenance problems have hit a point where the status quo just won't do.  It's a rental property. You don't own it. People should have no delusions about that. Just because you're paying rent doesn't mean the property owner can't make major decisions about what to do with the property. If you don't want to be in such a position then you should consider buying property yourself. Otherwise don't assume that simply because you moved in that things will perpetually remain the way they are.   Glendale is not the problem. The problem are the policies of gentrification and budget cuts that favor the needs of big developers over working class and low-income families.    No, it does indeed sound like, physically speaking, Glendale is the problem. The place was built in 1952, it just might need a little modernization. They're getting reimbursed for having to move (which is more than most people get) and they have the right to return once reconstruction is done (which most people don't get). Having a home that isn't just a patchwork of repairs here and there might just be a good thing for folks.   The residents of Glendale and their allies have shown that Glendale is public housing that works.    No, they've shown that Glendale is a stubborn community. The haven't shown that it's financially sustainable, or remotely reasonable, for the city to continue to maintain these townhomes rather than rebuilding them, or handing over management to a private company. In fact, this was, as the article says, a temporary reversal of the MPHA's decision."

When I went by yesterday morning they had utility trucks out vacuuming the load out. It was still there when I left late afternoon Friday.  What the hell happened? Did someone put a nickel on the rail instead of a quarter?"
TwinCities,3cx9nj,AaronGNP,7,Sat Jul 11 16:27:40 2015 UTC,"Trains derail a lot,  you just don't hear about it unless it involves a loss of life or hits something else. They will just push it off to the side until it can be repaired and/or rerailed.  Shutting down a rail line screws up the schedule all over the place,  so fast reopening is the priority."

TwinCities,3cvi4u,YashdalfTheGray,4,Sat Jul 11 03:02:39 2015 UTC,I also moved here from Ohio (Southwest). You'll fall in love with Minneapolis if you haven't already. There are so many ways to get active and the cities are full of young professionals like yourself. Some people on here will tell you it's a bit of a challenge to make friends here though.
TwinCities,3cvi4u,Connortbh,2,Sat Jul 11 13:04:42 2015 UTC,Just moved here from Cincinnati. Much prefer Cincinnati. What do you like about this place so much?
TwinCities,3cvi4u,slbmrly,2,Sun Jul 12 01:09:18 2015 UTC,"Everyone is so much nicer here, traffic is much better, I love the weather, nature-y stuff is better too. There are lakes everywhere and seemingly everyone has a cabin up north on one. I much prefer the mall of America to Kenwood. I also played hockey my whole life so it's refreshing to see a rink everywhere you look, have friends who want to watch hockey, and be able to go to a park and play. The mass transit is better in the cities. I can get home from the airport no problem. In Cincinnati the airport is way off in Africa.   I guess in all fairness I didn't live inside the city limits of Cincinnati or anything. I really do like downtown but you avail yourself of so many more opportunities by living in the twin cities."
TwinCities,3cvi4u,Connortbh,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:48:02 2015 UTC,"Huh, I'd disagree with almost all of those points. Most everybody in the Twin Cities seems to hate MoA to boot. Where did you live in Cinci? I was in Clifton. It was a blast."

I also lived in Clifton though. That might have changed my perceptions. Minneapolis is just white and bland as hell, though the nature is nice - I still prefer the Hocking Hills.  And MoA is tourist hell."
TwinCities,3cvi4u,slbmrly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:31:02 2015 UTC,Hocking hills is 2 1/3 hours from Cincinnati on a good day. That's not at all comparable to being able to ride a bike a couple miles to the chain of lakes on the numerous bike trails we have here. I'm guessing the reason you perceive people to be cold is because you seem to be unwilling to adjust or accept any change. I 100% believe if you open your eyes and go outside and try different things you'll see what the fuss is about.
TwinCities,3cvi4u,Connortbh,-2,Sun Jul 12 20:33:33 2015 UTC,"Dude, I can't afford the 2 grand a month rent to live in a closet it Uptown. People don't go beyond their high school cliques here and every transplant that has come up and not done school here has had that same experience. And biking is fucking boring after you do it once, to me. I don't want to play bike hipster. I want food that isn't bland and people with hobbies besides ""bicycle!""  Minnesota is the land of the white, privileged, binge drinking bicyclist. If you're a person of color, not from the suburbs, or have any clue what life is like out of Minnesota, you're told to go back to ""the ghetto"" (read: places without wine bars)."
TwinCities,3cvi4u,slbmrly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:03:57 2015 UTC,"Wow.  You could use a fresh look at the cities.  I don't like biking myself but I love it here.  To each their own I suppose.  But you're definitely missing out on the food and the cities themselves.   What do you like that you can't find here?  Stay away from chains and you'll be good.  Have you tried: Lucia's, Kyatchi, Revival, Nighthawks, Burch, 112 Eatery, Butcher & Boar, Bar La Grassa, Hautedish, Corner Table, Spoon & Stable, Travail/Rookery, Pig Ate My Pizza, Tilia, Heydey?   We've been named ""Next Great American Food City"" by Saveur Magazine and other national publications provide similar praises to our food scene, including having names for best restaurants and best chefs in America.  Don't be content thinking you've seen it all around here.  New things pop up all the time.  Also, feel free to rollerblade, walk, run, etc. on the many trails and at the parks.  They aren't just for bikers.  And there are buses and a train that go to the airport."
TwinCities,3cvi4u,minnesnowtah,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:18:49 2015 UTC,"Hautedish was fucking disgusting. Their restaurant week menu was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Literally everything was bad. Their attempts at Southern food were the blandest that this Southerner had ever had. Bar La Grassa was good but ridiculously overpriced and insanely loud. Minneapolis has a thing for loud bars where everyone wants to be ""Seen"". It's a city that runs exclusively on consumption. There's no emphasis on making friends here since people don't do that beyond 4th grade. It's been quite miserable for my partner and I as the rumors of MN Nice are truer than ever. If you don't like to bike or binge drink, it's impossible to develop a network.  Edit: I don't quite hate it here, but I'm definitely going to call this place out on its shortcomings. It's reminiscent of virtually every other Midwestern city except it rides high on a snooty air of hipster bullshit. I can see literally no advantages of Minneapolis to other towns like Cincinnati, Columbus, Chicago, etc., especially as we lack diversity, affordable real estate, and food that tastes like food. I'm not a fan of fine dining and the Twin Cities are severely lacking in good ethnic cuisine. Our best options are good, but we don't have anything ""great"" by any means. The fine dining attempts at ethnic cuisine just whitewash the shit out of it like Minnesotans do with everything else.  And god damn do people hate people of color here. Seriously. Non-stop racism from everyone I've met. They're scared of anyone who isn't white and clad in plaid.  Like seriously, y'all."

TwinCities,3cux3q,Jwpt,2,Fri Jul 10 23:51:06 2015 UTC,"What part of ""the area"" are you talking?  Minnesota is a pretty large state.  I assume you mean Minneapolis/St. Paul.  In that case, when will you be here?  What do you like to do?   Common answers to this question:  The lakes (Calhoun, Harriet, Isles, Nokomis, Minnetonka).  Most of the metro area lakes have food stands that are actually solid.  And many of these lakes are near Uptown, which is a nice area to walk/shop/drink/people watch.   Minnehaha Falls and the Minnehaha Parkway   Museums: Science, Bell, History, Walker, Guthrie, Weisman.  Walker has the somewhat famed Spoon Cherry.  Nice place.    Food: What do you like? Awesome places abound.  For my money: Kyatchi, Burch, 112 Eatery, Bar La Grassa, Hola Arepa, Picollo, Lake and Irving, and Lucia's.    Bars: What do you like?   Nordeast: Cool part of town.  Nye's Polonaise, Surdyk's, Jax's cafe, Betty Danger's, Psycho Suzie's, Gashtof, 1029. Scenic areas around the Mississippi River.     Twins Game. Target Field is solid.   St. Paul Saints Game.  Lowertown St. Paul and the CHS Field are solid.   Brewery Tours:  So many places to go these days.  We are pretty spoiled with our craft beer scene.  I like: Indeed, Sociable Cider, 612, which are all close to each other.  Bauhaus is also in that area.  Fulton and Surly are popular.  Surly has a large, new brewery that's pretty cool and has decent food.    Transit:  It's lacking in available routes in some cases, but the trains and buses are great to use to get around.  Take the green line from Minneapolis to St. Paul and back.  Blue line from MPLS to Mall of America (MOA is not a good representation of MN but it appeals to tourists)."
TwinCities,3cux3q,minnesnowtah,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:40:47 2015 UTC,"I did mean the Twin Cities area primarily however I'm driving clear across the state. I love hockey (too bad it's summer), hiking, eating and aerospace/automotive. Primarily I'd like to see a few big sites as well as neighborhoods that are popular among young people as I'm looking at moving to the area following graduating college in December.   Which lakes are the best sites while being very near ""city proper"" areas? Museums would need to be engineering/tech related and/or small for the time I'll have. I also know nothing of the history of the area so that could be cool.   I've heard there's very good southeast Asian food and African food, is that true? I'm always up to try new cuisine. I'm not a big bar person, partially due to sobriety but more to do with general antisocial tendencies. However the person I'm travelling with is a beer snob so breweries are an option but we plan on doing that in Fort Collins, CO (New Belgium).   Neither of us are baseball fans in the least. Is the Mall of America worth it at all? I could see stopping just to say ""I've been there""."
TwinCities,3cux3q,Noonsky,2,Tue Jul 14 00:16:37 2015 UTC,"If you like engineering museums, there's one called the Bakken which was started by the guy who founded Medtronic. The whole museum is about electricity and medical devices like pacemakers. If you go be sure to get a student discount on tickets.  But the Mill City Museum is probably better.   The Mall of America isn't really worth going to IMO. It is split up into wings and each wing just feels like a regular indoor shopping mall."

TwinCities,3cux3q,minnesnowtah,2,Tue Jul 14 23:03:32 2015 UTC,Mill City Museum is a 2-3 hour walk through if you stop and read everything and play around in all the interactive exhibits.

There is plenty of Asian food around.  St. Paul has an area known as ""frog town"".  The best places are ones no one will tell you about.  Little hole-in-the-wall joints.  There are also quite a few thai places, especially in the uptown area.  I prefer Tum Rup to most but it's subjective.  African food, no idea.    Many, many breweries to visit.  I like Indeed, Sociable Cider, and 612.  So many more.  Just google and explore.    Mall of America (MOA as it's commonly known) is a giant waste of time unless you're a tourist or you want to say ""I've been there"".    You've been to a mall before.

Any nicer establishment prob has them though. But some places just have shit ones. I like the Muddy Pig, but I had their mussels twice and they were shit.  There are mussels on menus in a lot of places, but like I said few. I don't see places generally serving them. And my wife and I specifically seek them out and go to restaurants based on that.

I also recommend the smoked salmon BLT.  I hope pulling mussels off menus doesn't become common though, I eat a fair amount of them.  Also, if you haven't ever tried, they are very easy to make at home, and you can be sure that no one isn't being lazy picking out the dead ones."

My vote would be the downtown one because they make cocktails the old way, e.g. egg whites for sours, homemade grenadine, etc. All their rails are what most people offer as top shelf (I think the rail whiskey is Windsor if I remember right) and the head of their cocktail program, Ian Lowther, is pretty genius at this stuff.

TwinCities,3ctk6x,SchruteFarmsInc,2,Sat Jul 11 18:20:06 2015 UTC,"With a few exceptions, you don't have to stop at an uncontrolled intersection. If you are travelling at a speed that is safe for the road conditions and you come upon an uncontrolled intersection, look both ways for cross traffic that may also be approaching and if it's safe go ahead and proceed through the intersection. I personally do this little safety check when approaching both controlled and uncontrolled intersections, even if I have the right-of-way. More than once I've had a vehicle blow through a light or stop sign where had I been complacent and not noticed them failing to stop I would have been hit.  The most common exception to this would be when you are approaching the intersection at approximately the same time as another vehicle. In this circumstance the vehicle on the left shall yield the right-of-way to the vehicle on the right.   Another common exception would be when you are intending to make a left turn within an intersection (uncontrolled or not). In this circumstance you would yield the right-of-way to any vehicle travelling in the opposite direction which is within the intersection or close enough that you cannot execute the turn safely. If the opposing vehicle has to slow down or brake as a result of you executing a left turn, you should have waited for them to pass first. If you have any doubt about their speed or distance, wait the extra few seconds.  For both of these exceptions it's worth mentioning there may be times that a vehicle behind you will disagree with your decision to wait or yield. They may get upset and honk, yell, whatever. If this happens... fuck 'em. Just stay calm, don't engage or react to them, and don't panic and prematurely enter the intersection or execute a turn. This is more often than not going to result in an accident. If it escalates to the point where you feel physically threatened, do not hesitate to call 911. Odds are they will disengage if they realize you are calling 911. Even if they do disengage and leave the area, make note of the license plate and physical description of the driver and provide that to the dispatcher. Do not follow them!  edit: Sorry for the wall of text :/"

TwinCities,3cohsm,CivEZ,12,Thu Jul 9 14:32:32 2015 UTC,"There's a couple of problems I see with this.  First: the data is three years old. I'd like to see these numbers re-analyzed knowing what we now know about the Blue Line, Green Line, and transit projects in other states.   Second: the ROI won't be realized until 2030, estimated, and the ROI numbers are over a 15 year period (meaning $440-673 million per year after 2030). Now, that's not exactly a bad number in and of itself, but it's something that should have been disclosed in the post's body. We don't see an ROI immediately.  Third: ROI is a potentially misleading number, or name even. Does this mean that for the state, despite public subsidies to fund transit ridership, that transit essentially becomes revenue neutral? Or is this increased revenue after considering subsidies? What does ROI even mean in this context?  Fourth: How are they coming up with that estimate of $4.4 Billion? Is this considering bare-bones build-out, like the most spartan of transit stations, or is it considering improvements to existing infrastructure (like the new bus stop signs with more information), or is it considering increased frequency of existing routes, or what? Reasonably it would be some kind of balance of that, but what?  I'm not saying that increased investment in transit is bad, in fact I think quite the opposite, but I'm saying pointing to this specific study as presented as definitive proof that we need to pour money into mass transit in order for everything to become all rosy and wonderful. The data is out of date and the presentation is too vague.  For example, this isn't proof that we should just build the Southwest line, price tag be damned. It definitely says we probably ought to build it, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't be considering the price tag of some of the embellishments, or concessions made to different organizations and groups.   I thought this might be interesting to some people to have a report/source on why investing in public infrastructure, when done right, can be a BOON to a city, not as many would have you believe a detriment to the city.   I don't think we needed a study like this to tell us that. We just need to look at New York City to figure that out. Or Japan. Or Moscow. Or any of a number of European cities. The problem is that people can't get over the risk of short-term losses for long term gains. The region as a whole might benefit, but individual businesses and organizations are worried about what they're going to lose in the short term, and if it'll be enough to end things for them.   You can't just build a LR Line to every corner of the state.   Doing that would be immensely dumb. Light Rail isn't meant to do that anyway. I can't imagine sitting on one of those Siemens S70s all the way out to Duluth. Such a ride would be uncomfortable and unpleasant; LRT trains don't even have bathrooms. At that point you're better off with standard regional rail, Amtrak."
TwinCities,3cohsm,Kichigai,3,Thu Jul 9 15:43:41 2015 UTC,"Everything you say is level headed and logical. And I largely agree.    I think the ItascaReport is good, because it shows a very high-level review of light rail / mass transit infrastructure in the twin cities. I posted This Victoria Transport Policy Institute PDF below in another comment. This article/review is FAR more comprehensive and addresses your comments directly using data from existing light rail systems.    And I agree so much with this statement:    The problem is that people can't get over the risk of short-term losses for long term gains. The region as a whole might benefit, but individual businesses and organizations are worried about what they're going to lose in the short term, and if it'll be enough to end things for them.     That really is the biggest thing to me. And it is a rampant frame of mind in our Individualistic American corporate ""ME"" mindset. This nation is all of us together. I don't like sports, I don't go to Vikings/Twins/Timberwolves/Wild games. But I fully support the infrastructure we built to have those things in our city. Because of what they provide tangibly and intangibly to the city. The same way I don't utilize public welfare, I fully support it, because I know it helps make my city less disparate.     It's about ""us"" and the future! not about ME and NOW."

TwinCities,3cohsm,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:48:20 2015 UTC,"Transport in Melbourne:       Transport in Melbourne consists of extensive networks and a wide variety of transport services in the city of Melbourne, Australia, including:   The world's largest tram network. Bus (which consist of 323 routes) and coach services A metro railway network (16 lines - the second largest in Australia) A regional rail network (5 lines) Interstate railway services (NSW TrainLink Southern and The Overland) The largest freeway network in any Australian city  Two major passenger airports (including Tullamarine, the second busiest in Australia) Port of Melbourne (Australia's busiest port for containerised and general cargo) Multiple taxi, hire car and other small commercial passenger vehicle services Public bike-hire system (since mid-2010)   According to the 2006 Census, in terms of travel to work or study Melbourne has the second highest rate of public transport usage among Australian capital cities with 17.7%, however this is a far distant second to Sydney's 26.3% and only just greater than Brisbane's 17.5%.  As of 2009, the share of public transport measured in passenger kilometres is around 11%, with private motor vehicle accounting for 89%.  Melbourne has more roadspace per capita than any Australian city and its network of freeways is comparable with cities including Los Angeles and Atlanta  and the city is also home to much of Australia's Automotive industry (although Holden, Ford and Toyota will pull out at the end of 2017,  2013  and the end of 2017  respectively). In 2002, the state government set an ""aspirational goal"" as part of Melbourne 2030 for this mode share to decrease to 80%, however the Eddington Report released in 2008 concluded that the mode share of private vehicles is likely to stay the same (or increase) to over 90% in 2005.  This is despite booming figures for public transport growth in recent years  and despite studies into road congestion in 2008, official VicRoads figures showed no growth in car travel on Melbourne's roads,  possibly due to roads reaching full capacity.

They've got the rails between the two cities and one to the airport and those make sense.  I can't see anything going to rich suburbs being successful."

There's no way that inflation, borrowing, and other risk costs are only 2.8% were a 15-30 year municipal bond issued by the state.  20-year MN munis alone are at around 4% yield right now.  If the discount rate is off, that changes the annual ROI a lot.

I have one speeding ticket 3 years ago, wife has an at fault accident about 2 years ago."
TwinCities,3ckirn,vivithemage,25,Tue Jul 14 13:04:01 2015 UTC,"If you're thinking ""drop insurance and not drive,"" sell the car.  You can't leave it in one spot for a year, you still have liability while moving it, and having a car sitting never being run is not the best for the car either."
TwinCities,3ckirn,Tuilere,14,Wed Jul 8 17:27:51 2015 UTC,having a car sitting never being run is not the best for the car either   And good luck starting it on a cold night for a snow emergency when you have to move it.

TwinCities,3ckirn,TheMacMan,11,Wed Jul 8 18:45:51 2015 UTC,"The Minneapolis 311 app makes it easy for anyone to report a car that's been left there. If the cops show up, they'll ticket it and you'll have to come and show proof of insurance. If you can't show proof that you had insurance at the time of the ticket, you will be fined.  It's against Minneapolis law to have a car parked on the street or even in your own driveway without insurance. It must be stored out of plain sight if you don't plan on insuring it."
TwinCities,3ckirn,AleccMG,10,Wed Jul 8 17:35:31 2015 UTC,I'd be concerned about it being towed once the plows start rolling.
TwinCities,3ckirn,jordanjay29,6,Wed Jul 8 17:07:51 2015 UTC,"If you're really not going to drive it, you should look into some long-term storage units for cars. There are plenty around the Metro, and they should run you much less than the full cost of insurance."
TwinCities,3ckirn,MrsTiggyWiggy,8,Wed Jul 8 17:59:04 2015 UTC,My neighbors do it but they move the vehicle regularly. They just re-park it every four days or so to the other side of the street.   I did have an old neighbor who left his junk car parked for so long that racoons moved in. Someone called the city on that.
TwinCities,3ckirn,Corn0ffTheCob,4,Wed Jul 8 17:05:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is a 72 hour limit. I haven't heard of it being enforced, but you wouldn't have much recourse if it were towed. Are you thinking of parking it on the street in lieu of getting insurance? I believe any car parked on Minneapolis streets is required to carry insurance as well. Doubtful that it would be enforced, but another thing to keep in mind. If you do leave it parked there, stay aware of street sweeping, leaf cleaning, snow emergencies, special events, tree work, or any of the other number of reasons that a valid parking spot will turn invalid over night. As long as you don't get towed for temporary no parking conditions and your neighbors don't complain, you should be fine.  Edit: apparently the 72 hour rule does get enforced."
TwinCities,3ckirn,Tuilere,6,Wed Jul 8 17:10:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, it gets enforced.   There's also plowing fun."
TwinCities,3ckirn,PoetmasterGrunthos,5,Wed Jul 8 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"It also depends on whose house you park in front of. If you park in front of your own house (or the house you live in) you're probably safe for a while. If your hunk of junk is parked in front of my house, somewhere around week two is where I'm annoyed enough to have it towed.   Edit: It's also worth mentioning that the city makes every possible effort to NOT tow vehicles that are parked over 72 hours.  When a complaint is made, they will drop by and place a warning flyer on the car indicating that it will be ticketed and towed after 72 additional hours.  You have to try pretty hard to get towed for this."
TwinCities,3ckirn,hypnotickaleidoscope,4,Wed Jul 8 17:22:09 2015 UTC,My roommates car got towed last year from south mpls after only 4-5 days of sitting there.

TwinCities,3ckirn,Schmecca,3,Wed Jul 8 17:52:49 2015 UTC,"If you're really committed to keeping the car for the year - there are places that store cars for $50-$100 a month.  No need to move it for plowing, and little risk of damage, etc.  I would go with that, but you'll still want to insure it for theft (and tell the insurance company that it won't be driven during that time)."
TwinCities,3ckirn,Aso_TC,3,Wed Jul 8 19:22:23 2015 UTC,Why not put it in storage? It will cost much less for a year and you get your car back by the end. I know a few storage places in Bloomington that are fairly priced.
TwinCities,3ckirn,lkaos,3,Wed Jul 8 23:44:43 2015 UTC,"It seems you have 3 options here. 1- get different insurance. 2- sell the car since you won't use it.

TwinCities,3ckirn,beard-second,3,Wed Jul 8 23:59:34 2015 UTC,No you can't leave your car parked for a year on a city street. Also you would still need insurance to have the car on a public road since it's a state requirement to have insurance.

TwinCities,3ckirn,killswithspoon,8,Wed Jul 8 17:24:55 2015 UTC,"It's required for the car to be on the street, just like you have to have up to date tabs to be on the street. If you want to park it in a garage or in storage, you don't need insurance or tabs.  If you really want to keep it and just take the bus I'd recommend putting it in storage somewhere. It won't be free, but it might be cheaper than insurance and parking."
TwinCities,3ckirn,TheMacMan,3,Wed Jul 8 17:28:45 2015 UTC,Both. The way the 72 hour rule is usually enforced is someone will report your car not having moved. Cops come by and mark your tires with chalk and swing back by in a day or so to see if it's moved. If not it will get ticketed or towed.
TwinCities,3ckirn,Hermosa06-09,3,Wed Jul 8 17:31:36 2015 UTC,When I was living in Minneapolis and not using my car much I would go drive around the block then park again. That way the calks marks weren't in the same spot.

TwinCities,3ckirn,An-Angel-Named-Billy,4,Wed Jul 8 18:20:22 2015 UTC,They're private property but in public view. They must also have current tabs. This prevents people from storing a pile of old cars in their driveway and creating an eyesore.

You can leave it on the street as long as you constantly move it, but that'll be a big hassle. If you do find a place to store it, you'll still have to start the car up every few weeks and drive it around a bit to keep it in working order, which is also a hassle. If you leave the car sitting for a year, you'll cause damage to the tires, battery, even engine and possibly other components."

TwinCities,3ckirn,toniMPLS,4,Wed Jul 8 18:09:01 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, MN is a no fault state and has higher minimum requirements than ND. Also, the risk of theft or vandalism is higher in Minneapolis than Grand Forks. Lastly there's nore traffic on the road.

TwinCities,3ckirn,nkris,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:08:30 2015 UTC,"Region can change things. Grand Forks has the population density of Andover. Moving to a greater traffic can increase rates just the same with some companies. Also, age doesn't really start decreasing till you are 25. And I know a lot of people who were in grad school before that age. But, as for the car, I had no info as to what it was, that's why most of this is guessing."

TwinCities,3cgy30,candycaneforestelf,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:58:26 2015 UTC,"Why would one assume that?

TwinCities,3cgy30,TheMacMan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:11:58 2015 UTC,"The X is a newer facility, for one. Two, it's already setup for ice hockey, while the Target Center is setup for basketball.  For the sport the Swarm play, the Target Center would be more expensive because they'd incur more setup costs before each home match, especially with their entire season running concurrently with part of the Timberwolves season. Indoor lacrosse for the National Lacrosse League is played on a de-iced or covered hockey rink, which is significantly wider and longer than a basketball court. 200 ft x 85 ft are the dimensions the NHL uses, and many NLL teams play in NHL arenas, while an NBA court is 94 ft x 50 ft. Sure, hockey's played at the Target Center, but it's at most a couple times a year and usually for a whole weekend or two."
TwinCities,3cgy30,candycaneforestelf,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:21:10 2015 UTC,The NHL season operates at the same time the NLL does too. They can make it work just as Vikings and Gophers football happened at the same time in the same stadium at the Dome. They only play 8 lacrosse games at home each year so it's pretty simple to find the Friday and Saturday nights to make it happen.   I'm sure it was far more than simply rent that caused the Swarm to leave.

My point was that conversion costs were cheaper at the X, so Target Center wouldn't have been a more viable option to even consider for the Swarm even if rent were cheaper, since conversion labor costs would have been more expensive at Target Center than the X, since Target Center's hockey rink side would need to be set up, while with the X, they could just cover the ice. The Lynx, unlike the Swarm, do not have to worry about massive conversion costs (they also fall under the same ownership umbrella as the T-Wolves, too, iirc).   I'm sure it was far more than simply rent that caused the Swarm to leave.   Well, yeah, lack of profitability was the primary reason for leaving. Rent costs are a big factor in whether a team is profitable or not."
TwinCities,3cgy30,candycaneforestelf,0,Wed Jul 8 20:03:04 2015 UTC,"We don't know for sure that conversion costs were less at the X. They have to remove all the boards and replace them as they're entirely different including different sponsors.   The Lynx, unlike the Swarm, do not have to worry about massive conversion costs (they also fall under the same ownership umbrella as the T-Wolves, too, iirc).   They play an a different court which has to be switched out. There are still plenty of costs involved.  All of this is pure assumption. We don't have any idea of if costs are more or less at one arena than the other. For all we know it may be far easier and less costly to convert the Target Center for use as a NLL field. We have no idea so all of this is purely assumption. While I could ask my ex exactly what it cost the Swarm to rent the X, we don't have any rates for the Target Center so there would be no way of making a comparison."

I am all for having a good time, but these pricks don't give a flying fuck about the lake.  They have completely trashed that portion of the lake.  The DNR says the amount of litter there is abhorrent.    I stick to the west side of the lake where it tends to be quieter."

Once all the pleasure boats come out those waters are practically unusuable unless you have a giant cruiser. It's just constantly being bounced around by the wake of much larger vessels.

That can literally be accomplished at the cabin standing next to the dock; in fact we do the same exact thing while they are gone. The biggest difference though is we can control who is there and won't have our day ruined because a random, drunk 50 year old townie puked in our boat because he, ""didn't want to get the water dirty."""

Normally the forest floor would have tons of little fires that clean up the fallen debris and stuff. These fires move very differently, hardly causing damage yet burning away the brush.

I ended up with a fairly decent spot on some back road at the top of a dirt pile (thank you 4wd). But we missed at least half the show. So thank you CBS local, for that completely WRONG info, and your attempt at disappointing a sick 4 year old boy.

Aquatore is where they hold the Blaine Festival the weekend before (not including) the 4th. Traditionally, there has been a soccer match on the 4th, followed by fireworks. Minnesota United were on the road this year (thanks, NASL), but they still shoot them from the staging area at the NSC because the surrounding area has the best traffic flow in and out, and the area they shoot from has good security and won't go off or shed debris over US10.

Then 10pm came and people are getting antsy.  Getting close to 11pm a lot of people left (mostly families).  When  the fireworks finally do start you could feel the vibe drain right out of the place with a collective WTF.  The fireworks were hardly visible anywhere at Mounds View.  Giant fail for the city.

It has more museums, quieter night life, more of a mid 30 year old vibe. Minneapolis is more vivacious and young. Of course you can find a bit of both in either city, but I was just pointing out the general trend.   Unfortunately, St. Paul has a ton of construction going on downtown. They're putting up a giant hotel/apartment building on West 7th, where all the bars are. If that puts you off, then avoid it. Otherwise, Liffey has an awesome quiet roof-top patio."

TwinCities,3bygv6,franklin_stubbs,28,Fri Jul 3 05:17:21 2015 UTC,"It's called a protest.  People do it when they are trying to send a message to the people in power.  In this case, the mods of Reddit actually provide a pretty important service to the site for free and they have a basic expectation that the administrators and owners of the site will act in good faith.  The alternative would be never to do anything when they feel like they're being disrespected."
TwinCities,3bygv6,HAL9000000,9,Fri Jul 3 14:05:56 2015 UTC,I can't believe how big a part of their lives people allow Reddit to become...

TwinCities,3bygv6,HAL9000000,3,Fri Jul 3 18:01:15 2015 UTC,"Well that's a somewhat separate issue.  Yes, it is mindboggling to me that some people devote a ton of time to modding or just to being a contributor.  But the fact is that they do and they obviously get personal gratification from it and we benefit from their work to some degree.  And really, it's not much different from having an interest in books or sports or whatever.  It's just a choice of how people like to spend their free time.  So unless you think you can qualitatively show that your interests are better than there's, I think you have to conclude that it's just different people with different tastes.  There's a whole other discussion we could have about how some mods probably get some kind of pleasure out of feeling like they have power over people.  But fundamentally I think it's just an interest people have that I can't judge them for."
TwinCities,3bygv6,1iI1iI1iI1iI,7,Fri Jul 3 18:09:05 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about people losing their minds over someone getting fired. It happens every day, and frequently to innocent people. But, since it's some Reddit martyr this time the whole site needs to flip out and shut down half the subs.   Honestly, I couldn't care less about Reddit's management. I'm just flabbergasted at how people are reacting. Anyways, the site sucks today. Heading up north for the weekend. Bye bye."
TwinCities,3bygv6,slattie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:11:53 2015 UTC,"Reddit staff fired this girl.  This girl was key in helping the volunteer moderators manage their pages.  The people who volunteer to moderate these pages are frustrated because they feel ignored, so they close down the pages they moderate.  Reddit users get involved because their favorite subreddits/websites are closed down.   And then of course there are the people you are talking about who I honestly think just jump on the bandwagon and love to see this internet drama go on and on. I honestly feel like that's the majority, but I do see the frustration on the side of the moderators. If I decided to dedicate my time volunteering to make something work and the people in charge seemed disinterested in helping to keep it running, I'd be pretty annoyed too."
TwinCities,3bygv6,HAL9000000,-1,Fri Jul 3 20:42:12 2015 UTC,"So why do you suppose that Reddit is better than similar sites like 9gag or The Chive or Digg?  Or do you not think Reddit is actually better?  If you don't think Reddit is better than those then sure, just use whatever site you want.  But if you think that Reddit is better then you might at least stop and think for a moment why that might be.  I think it's because Reddit has had the most openness and it's been the best social network platform available for many forms of content whether it's certain kinds of political speech or just funny or amazing shit.  And the reputation for openness is what attracts all of the smart and thoughtful people who recognize this as the best site.  And if you take away the things about the site that have made it great, then it becomes just like all of its shitty imitators.  So sure, you don't care about Reddit's management but if you like Reddit then you either should acknowledge that how Reddit users feel about Reddit matters to making Reddit worth visiting.

The Chive is just as good an interface for cats and girls showing their tits without the stuff you think is a hassle (like the political activism, the great original content from some users, the deep and illuminating submissions/comments that regularly come from a lot of different people, and the frustration with people who try to fuck it all up, etc...).

TwinCities,3bxcqi,ashenblade,2,Fri Jul 3 00:45:44 2015 UTC,"Use caution when copying building keys. Some landlords will get pretty pissed if they find out. It says 'do not duplicate' for a reason. They want to control the number of keys and know who has them. For instance, if someone were to end their lease, they might have extra keys and still have access to the building (or give them out to someone who can use them for malicious intent). They can get pretty sore about it and if they find out, they will probably try to stick you with the bill to get the building re-keyed. Source: I have done this, and this happened.  However: A good portion of the time, small hardware stores (such as Ace Hardware) will copy these keys as long as they have blanks for them, as they simply don't care or don't really pay attention to that.  There are MinuteKey kiosks in many retail stores such as Walmart that are very easy to use and are inexpensive, and work with a good variety of keys (I have used these many times and for 99% of the time have no issues).

TwinCities,3bv7ev,stillhaventfound,5,Thu Jul 2 12:58:53 2015 UTC,They shouldn't be building stations and parking lots/garages.  They should be connecting the light rail to shopping malls.  Eden Prarie Center (like most malls) don't have huge volumes of traffic in the middle of the day -- they have vast parking resources already.  They generally are easily accessible in their communities.  They could even open early to allow shops in the mall to cater to the waiting commuters.  And what mall wouldn't want people on their doorstep every morning and evening for 5 days/week?
TwinCities,3bv7ev,mattsoca,7,Thu Jul 2 14:22:02 2015 UTC,"They shouldn't be building stations and parking lots/garages.  Why not? A station is just a stop in a neighborhood. Shopping can, and probably will, build up around those stations. Look at the shopping centers built up around the Eagan transit hubs and park-and-rides.   They should be connecting the light rail to shopping malls.   The only problem with that is that the malls already serve as a sort of de facto transit hub. The local Transit authorities already go there. So snaking the Southwest line through the malls in those areas wouldn't really do anything other than replace express lines into Down Town.  The proposed Southwest route puts stations in more residential areas, which allows people who live in that area to have access to transit that otherwise may not have been running anywhere near there. It also induces the local municipalities to run new transit lines from the LRT stations to those malls, which means more routes going through more residential neighborhoods, which means greater access to transit for people who live in that area.   They could even open early to allow shops in the mall to cater to the waiting commuters.   But that doesn't grow anything. With new stations you have a reason for businesses to look beyond the Mall to set up their businesses. The Ridgedale Mall already has coffee shops, but with the LRT station being somewhere else that gives Starbucks or Dunn Brothers or whoever a reason to build another location elsewhere. It also opens up opportunities for non-Mall-esque businesses. When was the last time you saw a dry cleaner's in a mall? Or a convenience store (the one at the Mall of America doesn't count, you can't even buy milk or a newspaper in there). Or a local food truck could camp out there during the morning rush.  Plus malls aren't easy-in-easy-outs. Let's look at the station at the Mall of America for example: you have to go up one floor and across the street to get into the Mall, and if you want fast food you have to go up three more floors and then either to the North or the South (the station is in the West). So that's probably a ten minute trip to go over and get your food, not exactly something you can do while waiting for the train because by the time you got up there you'd have missed your train.  And before you write that off as me being lazy, it's not that I'm lazy, if I'm that hungry I'll make that journey, but other people probably won't. How many people were bitching about having to walk two blocks to get to CHS Field this past April? You think they're going to go up four flights and a quarter of the way around the Mall just to grab an Egg McMuffin before riding the train?"
TwinCities,3bv7ev,Kichigai,4,Thu Jul 2 16:42:14 2015 UTC,"I know that MOA does NOT allow folks to park there and then take the train in. They want you to park at the next stop, 28th Ave. Station in the ramp.

A major anchor tenant, such as a sports stadium, could just be the thing to spark development. See: Twins ballpark and the Warehouse District.  In any case, it's all academic. Mpls doesn't want that stadium, and have made it perfectly clear. Either our elected officials are in the Wilf's back pocket, or they're suffering stadium fatigue.  The St Paul locations could work, assuming this is a serious inquiry and that St Paul could secure the tac breaks without causing a revolt. Oy, vey, I just love living in a small-town farm state.

TwinCities,3btbhk,brokencorner,5,Thu Jul 2 04:20:21 2015 UTC,"To be specific, the issue is tax breaks, not public money as seen on the other stadiums. The MLS park would be built entirely with private funds. They're asking for a tax break on construction materials and possibly (this isn't 100% certain) a permanent waiver on property taxes.  But this is 't really about a soccer stadium. It's really about the Bikings stadium, and the $500 million tab picked up by taxpayers. People in Minneapolis are mad as hell about that, and feel they've been sold out. There's no way in hell another sports stadium could be built in this toxic environment. Heck, I'm surprised I haven't seen angry mobs at the Vikings stadium site, armed with torches and pitchforks, to tear the whole place down.  The Twin Cities are the one region that would welcome a sports team leaving over its stadium. ""Don't let the door hit ya on the way out, eh!"" It's only the elected officials who make these deals happen, over the overwhelming objections of the voters. It's amazing we have any professional sports teams at all. By all rights, Minnesota should be Iowa.  Oh, well. It doesn't matter now. Odds of St Paul taking that stadium are slightly better than Mpls, but still very low. I'd say Sacramento gets their MLS team, and Minnesota shrugs it off and goes fishing."

TwinCities,3btbhk,themill,3,Thu Jul 2 13:09:28 2015 UTC,Not if it's revenue that would never be generated if the stadium weren't built (i.e. the construction materials will simply not be bought generating $0 in sales tax revenue).

TwinCities,3btbhk,themill,2,Thu Jul 2 17:29:54 2015 UTC,"That's true, but that's not the comparison. The point that I'm making is that if the stadium is built with tax breaks, it is functionally equivalent to the city handing them a bunch of money to help them build it."
TwinCities,3btbhk,ghibliblog,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:35:57 2015 UTC,"This is an issue of some confusion. I suspect some parties involved (read: those in the Wilf's back pocket) have muddied the waters. The MLS group is asking for tax breaks on building materials, which is standard for most (if not all) building projects downtown. The other request is to keep the stadium site's property taxes at the same level they are now, for a period of 10 years.  If true, this is a key difference. They would be asking for us, really, to not raise their taxes. They aren't asking to pay zero property taxes, forever (as was commonly reported). They're asking to pay the same property taxes that the current site pays, for a period of 10 years.  This would mean that taxpayers, really, aren't losing out on anything. We're talking about future tax revenue that doesn't exist and is not being collected. Nothing is being lost. Nobody's taxes will be raised as a result.  I might be wrong on this, so you'll have to excuse me if I goofed. But it's certainly not the end of the world, or another massive taxpayer bailout, ala the Vikings (which folks in the Twin Cities absolutely hate with a passion). Some honest clarification is badly needed; passions are just too high, and Minnesotans are convinced they're being asked to buy another sports stadium. This may not be the case.  Remember, your elected officials, including the mayor are not virtuous saints looking out for you. They're working for the Wilfs, who want a soccer team inside the Metrodome II (ugh, ""US Bank Stadium"" sucks), and used that as leverage for getting that stadium built."

The 'Bus Barn' site looks like a barren wasteland, and the Sears parking lot is close. The skyline of the Sears site is better, that is for sure.   If anything I am guessing that the Bus Barn site would be the one chosen, as the Met Council owns most of the land, they have been trying to redevelop that area for the last few years, and is much more easily accessed from the highway."

We see how the Twins ballpark has transformed the Warehouse District into something that, well, isn't an empty graveyard.  The Mpls site is the best choice; unfortunately, Mpls doesn't want the stadium and have made that abundantly clear. Our 60-year obsession with fleeing in terror to the suburbs continues.  The St Paul Midway location could work, since it's next to light rail and I-94. Add in a couple hotels and restaurants, and you've brought back that neighborhood to life. And it's easy for most people to reach. The Sears site could also fill a large empty space that would benefit St Paul, but it's a little less accessable. Maybe if St Paul had more residents in their core, it could work.  I don't believe the St Paul option is a ploy to syaw Mpls. I think it's an honest attempt to keep Minnesota in the picture for an MLS franchise. But they won't wait long before calling Sacremento. Now, if that happens, and MLS gives up on Minnesota, what happens to their relations with the Wilfs? That's the real $64,000 Question to ask."

TwinCities,3brlb6,123_Meatsauce,6,Thu Jul 2 03:17:48 2015 UTC,"You could just google it.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality  http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2011/09/berg.htm  Studies have shown that counties with more income equality can sustain growth for longer periods of time. So rising income inequality is generally bad for economic growth. US income inequality has been rising since the 1970s. It's generally assumed that if we could even marginally increase incomes for those who make less than $150,000, economic growth would remain more consistent."

The proposed methods, while I don't trust their security (""doesn't retain data after analyzed"" has different levels of importance depending on the specifics of that analysis), aren't really even the issue.  The issue is that the library no longer believes it can do its job without tracking its users in a non transparent manner.

Actually, my first two thoughts were that either this was about harvesting library information for purposes that could be twisted to serve ulterior motives, or it was going to be Amazon-like trend tracking to help people find new and interesting things at the library.   For years the library doesn't keep track of what people have checked out (after they turn it in)   Unless you owe a fee.   what websites they visit (though that won't ever happen, not that patrons don't have to follow the library's internet policies)   Not that the libraries don't have bidirectional firewalls to filter both incoming and outgoing content to make sure people follow policy. Though thankfully that's what we in the video industry call a ""brick wall limiter,"" it just ""dumbly"" blocks things without any kind of analysis or intelligence.   This has always been important to me   I say it's important to more than just you. I say it's important to everyone who uses the libraries, whether they realize it or not.   but it is just smart to anonymously couple the sort of data like location, poverty level, format, etc. to better serve the patrons.   It is smart, but it is the implementation that is important. Honestly, given all the noise that has come out of librarians in the past with regards to privacy and whatnot I think they are probably one of the most trustworthy government agencies that has ever been implanted into peoples' communities.   Cool initiative.   Agreed. Having read about what the program actually is, I feel much better about who has this data and what it is being used for.   And Kit Hadley is awesome.

Thanks OP, keep up the good work on keeping me informed :)  Second, some of this stuff can be taken too far I think. I honestly wouldn't have never known that Calhoun had a negative connection until I read this. Are there really that many people that know this, and are still offended? Obviously things called n-word are offensive, and should be changed, but, how many people are really bothered by Calhoun? We can't erase all of history with new gentle naming.

I'm glad I can keep folks informed and commenting on what's going on in our neighborhoods - people are more powerful and have more in common with one another than they suspect, and that gets more true the more local you get, imho. At the risk of giving away my secrets, a lot of what I find comes from checking [The Glean](minnpost.com/glean) once or twice a day and posting anything interesting that comes up there.   But as long as you've got me engaged with flattery, I guess I should reply to the main substance of what you're saying - I don't think that keeping the lake name really does anything to promote a greater awareness of our history (like some have pointed out, most people didn't know the namesake until talks of changing it came up again), and I don't think changing it will make it harder to learn either (there's already a ton of news reports and other writings documenting the multiple efforts to change the name, so future people who are interested in the lake will end up hearing about this debate). All a change would do is send a symbolic message that present-day Minneapolis doesn't support Calhoun's views and wants to make sure it isn't associated with them. I can appreciate that that seems like judging a historical figure with the benefit of hindsight and that might seem unfair, but a) his feelings won't be hurt by this, he's dead, b) he was a pretty awful person even by the standards of his day, and c) it's not like his lousy views are causing us to overlook when be cured cancer or did anything else that outstanding for this state or country, he was a mediocre vice president and secretary of defense who just happened to be signing the paychecks of the right surveying crew in Minnesota to get his name on the lake."

Maybe I am a simpleton in my thinking, but it seems to me that things like this Are nothing but ""busy work"" to keep the people in charge of these things with a paycheck. In addition to the warm fuzzy feelings they no doubt get by ""helping the people"" with these important matters to show how much they care about us.   When I see things like this, I always think that the time, effort, money, could be spent elsewhere. On things that will actually make a difference in people's day to day lives.

It's been years since I've gone, but since I grew up in Duluth, where they really put on some serious shows (I was there when they nearly blew up Bayfront).

TwinCities,3bnvc3,candycaneforestelf,2,Tue Jun 30 19:56:59 2015 UTC,"Not sure for must-sees, but most towns have parades and fireworks shows.  Actually, now that I think about it, Taste of Minnesota is actually this weekend out in Waconia. It runs from the 2nd to the 5th. It actually used to run on Harriet Island in Saint Paul, but they had to move it due to flooding.  Personal directions to Waconia from both Minneapolis and Saint Paul that I think are better but don't match with Taste of Minnesota's directions: Take 35W to 62, then take 62 West to 212, follow 212 West to Engler Blvd/ County Road 10, then head west on County Road 10 to Waconia. Then take either County 57 or MN 284 into downtown Waconia. Event is at the Carver County Fairgrounds and parking in Waconia during event times gets pretty hairy pretty quickly. It'll be even worse navigating since the city of Waconia started a project at the beginning of June to make MN 5 safer through the city. Alternatively, just take the SW Transit shuttle bus.  Waconia has its own fireworks show where it shoots off fireworks from Coney Island (or, at least, near it) on Lake Waconia and the best viewing spots on land are the two parks on the south lakeshore (Cedar Point Park in town and Lake Waconia Regional Park east of town), but both of those are quite popular and parking will unquestionably be a pain.  Other cities probably have better fireworks shows and there is no shortage of cities with festivities, but Waconia's where Taste of Minnesota is at this year."

TwinCities,3bnvc3,candycaneforestelf,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:09:16 2015 UTC,"Personally, I thought it was going to be a one time thing because of the flooding on Harriet, but I can think of plenty of reasons why Waconia might make more sense, like that the Carver County Fairgrounds might be drastically cheaper to rent and clean up than Harriet Island, for one. And Waconia is still technically a part of the metro. There are basically no hotels in Waconia and the surrounding communities, though since it's basically day trip distance or less for many in the Cities, that may not matter unless people plan on attending all four headliners.  Also, Rockfest in Cadott has no issues drawing people even further out of the Cities. Other than Harriet being ToM's traditional location, I don't see how it'd be more difficult to get people out to Waconia than out to Cadott. It's close enough that Southwest Transit is apparently running bus service from Downtown Minneapolis to the site (with 3 stops at Southwest operated transit stations along the way) every single day."
TwinCities,3bnvc3,Chasmosaur,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:37:47 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Is this the second year it's been out there? I agree the rent cost would make more sense, but I see problems with the new location. First, drawing a crowd. Way too many people in MN have cabins, or travel around the 4th. Then the lineup isn't quite the same as Rockfest. Instead of a weekend long party of one genre, it's bands with decent drawing power, but not really the same thing. ToM isn't a music festival, and last time I went, the food was pricey and way too much typical fair food. Even with public transit, I'm not sure tons of people will head out there. Maybe I'm wrong, and it will be a great event."

Apparently it was successful enough that it was worth keeping it in Waconia.

TwinCities,3bop37,bigboobsnatasha,5,Tue Jun 30 23:32:23 2015 UTC,"Seconding this, they have some great classes. Also have beer/wine for sale. Classes are on the pricier side but they have some great chefs come though. In my experience the classes skew older (40+) though with mostly couples. When my boyfriend and I went we were definitely the babies of the bunch. But we made 3 different dishes. Downside/Upside? They put you in groups for the recipes... which is great for meeting people but not so great for cooking. Too many cooks and all that. But we all ate dinner on the rooftop patio and it's pleasant and fun.   Lunds also does some cooking demos with recipes. No hands on stuff but it's Q&A with the chef as they prepare it. We watched an awesome class with Peter Botcher (Butcher and the Boar) which was a lot of fun - I was bummed that we missed the one with his wife Sarah, who does a pop-up bakery (Black Walnut Bakery) Saturdays at 11am at One on One downtown - shameless plug because I love her. Those classes are much cheaper (Around $15) and you're basically just paying for the meal. Then they give you the shopping list for the items at Lunds for you to try at home... which is why those classes are so cheap.   There's also a ton of food festivals and stuff around the area if you keep up with it which are great for getting into new flavors and stuff.   Anyway, best of luck with your cooking adventures. Minneapolis has absolutely amazing food :)"

Only 3-4 years since previous dental visit. I got a groupon for a cheap cleaning checkup and twin Cities dental. Everything was good and they said everything looked good. Then they looked at my x-rays and told me I needed a filling and two crowns, and would be $4,000. They then spend over 5 minutes trying to sell me on their payment plan.  I couldn't afford that so I waited until I had dental insurance. A year later I went to a different dentist and only had two small fillings.

TwinCities,3betwk,pateras,10,Sun Jun 28 16:04:22 2015 UTC,"A solar plant needs about 10 acres per megawatt of power. To put that in perspective, they're talking about limiting the size to something the about the size of Nicollet Island (if looking on a map, it's 0.078 sq. miles; 5mW requires 50 acres, or 0.075 sq. miles). That seems pretty sizable for a ""community solar garden."" Anything larger seems to lose the idea of the community part and starts to get closer to the commercial side of things.   If someone wants to go commercial, go for it, but my guess is that considering they said they received proposals for 1,000 Megawatt ""gardens"" (that's 15 square miles of ""garden""), they had to limit it somewhere.  Maybe they could have gone a bit bigger for those not in the cities with the space to do so, but then they are paying higher costs due to the connections being more widespread for a rural area."
TwinCities,3betwk,jough22,3,Sun Jun 28 23:20:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this seems like a ""we seriously need some limit, so we picked a number"" type deal than ""we need to limit solar so energy companies can fuck you over.""  Also,    a settlement between Xcel Energy, the state's largest utility, and a few community solar garden developers that caps a project's size at 5 megawatts, with the ability to serve about 715 homes.   I don't see the need to have a ""community"" have a single project larger than that. That's an insane amount of power. Also, you can see that the communities agreed on the settlement."

I don't see the need to limit what a ""community"" does unless it's obviously detrimental in some way to someone or something else. From that article, I'm not seeing any downsides to allowing community solar farms to grow larger.  That's like saying we have to limit the reach of public access TV because KSTP is worried it'll compete with them. Until Xcel brought things up there was no one really complaining about this.  I mean, look at why these farms are growing like this: people are buying in because they can't build their own. They don't have the expertise or experience to set up a solar system, or maybe they simply can't build one (e.g. renting instead of owning). So they buy into a farm with someone who can build and maintain it, and by concentrating the setup the community can leverage economies of scale.  Xcel is complaining that they have to shoulder the costs associated with transporting and distributing the electricity, which is a valid complaint, but why not just build that into the cost of operating a community solar farm? Start charging the farm for the service."

I dunno, get a party bus and go around to a few bars or go see a show.  I never had a bachelor party so I can't really suggest anything, but I could tell you what I would have done:  Wake up early that morning at 4am, venture off to Wisconsin for some distillery tours and have a beer in between or see stupid landmarks and stuff.  Paintball, skydiving, atv stuff, whatever after.  Get ice cream before lunch.  Venture back over to MSP and rent bikes and hit the 80+ miles of dedicated bike trails around the twin cities. Check out some new or old brewpubs, new brewpubs, any brewpubs, check out a game or event randomly, see a club downtown, etc.   Stop in at a hole in the wall bar for an hour.  Make out with a random girl (or guy if that's your thing, since marriage is now legal for gays everywhere) or have one of those stupid lists of things to do. There are about 50 bridesmaids within a block radius... like every fucking weekend.   If it's this weekend, hit up the gay pride parade stuff too; ton of events and drunkery downtown and a ton of events.

Finally some officer told her that it would be smarter for her to leave than to keep dragging out the court case and restraining order process.  I don't know exact wording the officer used, but my mom said it was heavily implied that something would happen to her if she didn't drop the charges.  Funny enough, the guy had a previous wife that disappeared one day and nobody knows where she went.

TwinCities,3b1dw6,TheMacMan,2,Thu Jun 25 19:22:42 2015 UTC,"Personal opinions about the Pedal Pub aside, this is something to think about when considering riding one. Just because the person driving the Pub is doing what they should be doing, doesn't mean drivers on the road with them will too. You're putting yourself in a very dangerous situation when you're on something like that. Cars have airbags, seat belts, crumple zones and countless other safety features to keep their passengers safe, while the Pedal Pub has none of that. You're pretty exposed out there on them.  Sadly, this won't be the last time we see a Pedal Pub and car incident. As the number of Pedal Pubs increases, we'll see more accidents involving them just as the number of car crashes increases as car ownership increased.  Do you really know that you're covered when riding the Pedal Pub? The state requires them to carry a minimum of a million dollar insurance policy, just as a taxi has to carry. But that's not a lot. A million might be good for 1-4 people in a typical taxi but it's certainly not going to cover the medical bills of 12 people carried on the Pedal Pub should they be involved in a significant accident. That'd offer less than $100k coverage to each person which as anyone that has visited a hospital knows, won't go far these days.   It might be time to think about the risks involved in a Pedal Pub sharing the road with cars and think about how people on board are protected."
TwinCities,3b1dw6,nekurashinen,6,Thu Jun 25 15:26:31 2015 UTC,"Well this is just silly.  Might as well warn people to not to ever walk around downtown because of how exposed they are to drunk drivers.  Hell, I have seen reports of a drunk driver crashing through a house so even there you aren't safe!   If your point was solely to think about Pedal Pub sharing the road and protecting the people on board... there are a whole host of vehicles (bikes, bike taxis, etc.) that share the road that would be hurt by any type of legislation on forcing non-automobile vehicles to have expensive safety features.  Statistically it isn't even worth it since these streets are actually quite safe.   Life is risk. Do you want to live or merely exist?"
TwinCities,3b1dw6,TheMacMan,4,Thu Jun 25 15:46:25 2015 UTC,"And biking on the road has serious risks too. I accept those risks when I bike every day. My point is that we need to consider them.  There's also a huge difference between those running a commercial business and those riding on their own. A business has a legal responsibility to act for the safety of their customers. There is no such requirements for ourselves out wandering in public.  They may want to consider the roads they allow Pedal Pubs on. It's certainly possible that busy streets like Hennepin Ave may not be safe for the slow moving Pubs and they should look to route things on less busy routes like Plymouth Ave or others.  Sadly, it's likely to take more of these accidents (and they will happen) and even someone dying before people will start thinking about the safety of those on board.  Both Germany and the Netherlands (where they're built and originated) have banned them. It's certainly possible that it'll happen here with time too if the ongoing issues keep occurring."
TwinCities,3b1dw6,nekurashinen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:03:01 2015 UTC,"Good points.  My kerfuffle was the comment of thinking twice about using the pedal pub... while I agree, I hate the thing!, I just don't feel its right to stop people from having a good time and a commercial entity from providing it. It is up to the Pedal Pub people to provide a safe experience and maybe some regulations to make sure they abide by that responsibility if they are not. However, this instance is looking to be caused by a drunk driver and there are already laws against that. I suppose one could make a point (and I think you do) that the Pedal Pub should be retrofitted with better safety implementations. I suppose... and they probably will if such incidents begin to occur regularly.  I don't know the statistics so I am only speculating, but I believe there is a pretty low number of incidents with the things and exceptionally low in terms of injury (except maybe, of course, drunk idiots injuring themselves)  I was actually surprised they took streets other than Nicollet. I suppose it would be boring to just cruise up and down Nicollet but that would at least be very safe.  I can only hope they choose streets like Hennipen and Nicollet more than streets where cars typically move faster. Either way, just following the rules of the road would prevent all accidents."

TwinCities,3b1dw6,nekurashinen,0,Thu Jun 25 19:26:34 2015 UTC,"Marshall and Hennepin should not be travelled fast enough for this to really be such a danger.

For christ sakes, you are driving in an air conditioned, bucket seated, entertainment center on wheels (cars)... why does everything in the city have to cater to cars, one of the very worst aspects of a downtown? Again, I have no love for the Pedal Pub but maybe drivers need to find better routes to drive recklessly on than the busy commercial lined ones?"

Just because the person driving the Pub is doing what they should be doing, doesn't mean drivers on the road with them will too. You're putting yourself in a very dangerous situation when you're on something like that.    This is true of venturing outside one's basement via any mode, including bike, motorcycle, foot or even a car. Every other user of a roadway, or sidewalk, or baseball field, or parking lot can be a hazard. More people die in car crashes with other cars than nearly any other ""accidental"" death mechanism.

Minneapolis does not want a soccer stadium. The voters and all elected officials are suffering stadium fatigue, and are especially hostile to any taxpayer subsidies (which includes the MLS owners not paying property taxes).  Just look at the outright hostility towards the new Vikings stadium. People in the Twin Cities absolutely despise that stadium, and having to hand over $500 million to the Wilfs. The proposed Commons Park is also very unpopular and may suffer for funding (although it's a bit early to guess on that one). Heck, folks are still grouchy about that Twins stadium, which also involved taxpayer support. Speaking of which, whatever happened to ""The Triad?"" Remember that little scam from 1997?  The suburbs would probably have been a wiser choice for a soccer stadium. The Twin Cities are a collection of suburbs, not a central city like Chicago, NYC, LA, Boston, Denver, etc. It's just a different arrangement here. The downtowns of Mpls and St Paul are too small and sparsely populated to justify so many professional sports stadiums, and that situation isn't likely to change much (despite the modest growth in the North Loop/Warehouse and riverfront areas). The MLS owners just didn't plan a realistic strategy.  Interesting to see Glen Taylor ask for more time now that we've reached the July 1 deadline. But what's going to change between now and the start of the 2016 legislature session? Maybe the owners will decide to pay their property taxes. Or maybe they go to Brooklyn Park.

TwinCities,3azrdw,Senatorweims16,3,Wed Jun 24 21:15:48 2015 UTC,Aren't all matches home games for some one? ( I don't watch soccer so maybe I'm wrong)
TwinCities,3azrdw,ursus_vii,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:56:09 2015 UTC,Yes. I suppose home game is redundant when talking about attendance for teams.
TwinCities,3azrdw,Senatorweims16,0,Thu Jun 25 21:25:06 2015 UTC,"Nobody said use it as is, they could expand the seating there for a fraction of the 150 million dollars that the new place is going to cost."
TwinCities,3azrdw,forgetfulburglar,2,Thu Jun 25 04:24:35 2015 UTC,Except that the team doesn't own the place and the facility itself has no interest in expanding that much.
TwinCities,3azrdw,bleakmidwinter,-3,Fri Jun 26 01:33:02 2015 UTC,"If the stadium holds 8,000 ish people how does attendance manage to be over double that number?  I don't give a shit about soccer what I care about is the fact that 2 major sports teams now that both suck ass have gotten two new stadiums off of tax payers dime.  Someone else said the team is paying for all of it so the field fairies can have their stadium."
TwinCities,3azrdw,DersTheChamp,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:57:11 2015 UTC,"If the stadium holds 8,000 ish people how does attendance manage to be over double that number?   It doesn't? That's how. Minnesota United FC averaged 6,133 for attendance in 2014. They averaged 9,192 for 2015. So I'm not sure where you're getting this double attendance number from.    I don't give a shit about soccer what I care about is the fact that 2 major sports teams now that both suck ass have gotten two new stadiums off of tax payers dime. Someone else said the team is paying for all of it so the field fairies can have their stadium.   So really, your gripe has absolutely nothing to do with the new Minnesota MLS team. Is what you're saying."
TwinCities,3azrdw,Senatorweims16,-2,Thu Jun 25 21:23:56 2015 UTC,I wouldn't care so much if they actually were consistently good that's all I'm saying
TwinCities,3azrdw,DersTheChamp,2,Thu Jun 25 21:29:04 2015 UTC,"Completely understandable, but that's the curse of being a Minnesota sports fan."
TwinCities,3azrdw,Senatorweims16,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:32:30 2015 UTC,Do I need to go and find the stats for the Twins for you? They have been doing really well so far this season. At one point this season they were the second highest ranked team out of both leagues. Do they have to win a World Series for the people around her to realize that they aren't shitty right now? Do you even know who won the last World Series without having to look it up? Check out the Brewers if you want a team that is doing poorly. That OPINION I just gave is based on FACTS involving the Brewer's current record. I bet you're that kind of person who ignores a huge winning streak just to complain about a single loss.
TwinCities,3azrdw,Whitey138,0,Tue Jun 30 07:49:07 2015 UTC,http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/min/history/year_by_year_results.jsp here's the facts you were looking for 1 minute Google search dude. the opinion I gave is based on fact you are only taking into account one season. And it should be very apparent from my other comments that the only reason I really have a problem with shitty teams getting new expensive ass arenas is because the owners of the teams don't fund it and find private investors they foist it on the public
TwinCities,3azrdw,DersTheChamp,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:20:18 2015 UTC,I'm going to go ahead and come right out and say it:  You are a goddamn uneducated fucktard. Shut the fuck up until you know what you're talking about.

TwinCities,3ay4yp,Dane-o-myt,30,Wed Jun 24 13:05:34 2015 UTC,Affinity Plus Federal Credit Union has been fantastic to me.  Night and day experience compared to Wells Fargo with relation to fees and customer service.  They will print your debit card out the day you open the account and you have access to all the US Bank ATMs without fees.
TwinCities,3ay4yp,ducttapejedi,5,Wed Jun 24 14:14:33 2015 UTC,Another vote got Affinity Plus. Kept them the year I lived in DC and they've been absolutely fantastic with everything we've needed.

TwinCities,3ay4yp,Octophants,2,Wed Jun 24 14:42:21 2015 UTC,TCF... lol!  The bank that reorders your daily transactions from largest to smallest  (instead of the order they post to your account) to maximize overdraft fees. Then aggressively market to naive college students who are among the most likely to overdraft their accounts. I cheer every single time that bank is robbed.
TwinCities,3ay4yp,SchruteFarmsInc,2,Wed Jun 24 22:33:52 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes. Also the bank that won't take ""no, I would not like to sign up for a TCF account"" for an answer during their presence at the U's Welcome Week."

TwinCities,3ay4yp,minnesnowta,11,Wed Jun 24 15:31:17 2015 UTC,"Go with a credit union. They're a little less convenient, but the quality of service is vastly superior."
TwinCities,3ay4yp,Kichigai,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:03:11 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say less convenient. Many CU's are apart of co-op and you can access your account form partner branches and ATM's.  https://co-opcreditunions.org/locator/
TwinCities,3ay4yp,jester8113,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:45:12 2015 UTC,"Even then though, try finding one with lobby hours on a Saturday. And their online banking systems tend to be a royal pain in the ass, with no API hooks into common accounting/budgeting/tax prep software/services.  It's totally worth it, though."
TwinCities,3ay4yp,Kichigai,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:58:19 2015 UTC,Those are some fair concerns. My CU allows no one to get the data. Instead they implemented their own mint style thing (which sucks). The also don't do ACH transfers so I always have to push / pull from my other outside accounts. Some good things to ask about when you open an account.
TwinCities,3ay4yp,jester8113,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:18:24 2015 UTC,"My CU has gone through a couple different third party online banking providers, but alas neither of them have any API hooks into anything. They can't even kick out CSVs. It's a major pain, but as long as I stay on top of things it's not undoable.  IMHO, it's worth it for quality customer service. Banking and the related financial products can be a major pain, but having someone there who can help navigate you through it and won't treat you like some rube to be duped and taken advantage of really does a lot to smooth over some inconveniences."
TwinCities,3ay4yp,Kichigai,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:18:48 2015 UTC,What do all of these acronyms mean?
TwinCities,3ay4yp,Kichigai,2,Thu Jun 25 02:53:50 2015 UTC,"CU – Credit Union API – Application Programming Interface, a way for different tools to interact CSV – Comma Separated Value, a way of storing data tables (e.g. spreadsheets) in a plaintext file. It's simple way of passing data around. IMHO – In my Humble Opinion"
TwinCities,3ay4yp,mossberg590,11,Thu Jun 25 03:23:04 2015 UTC,Affinity Credit Union - Excellent rates and customer service.  Online is a bit clunky and not convenient locations Wings Financial Credit Union - Crappy rates and inconvenient.  Great online website and customer service.  I've been with them for 20 years since NWAFCU days.  Breaks my heart to see them spending money to grow rather than improve their rates. Wells Fargo / US Bank / TCF - Large and don't care about you as a customer.  Middlin rates.  Very convenient locations but Fridays will have long lines.  Watch out for fees on accounts you don't use regularly.  You just have to ask them to stop the fees and they will.
TwinCities,3ay4yp,seahawks,7,Wed Jun 24 15:42:03 2015 UTC,"I have also heard that Spire Credit Union is pretty good as well.  Question- do you need a physical bank to do things?  Were you at a credit union before?  I moved here to the cities over 8 years ago and still use my previous out of state credit union online.  All my bills, money transfers, check cashing...all done online.  I haven't been in a bank in years."
TwinCities,3ay4yp,findinthesea,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:07:54 2015 UTC,I also use an out of state bank. Switching is a hassle given how small my banking needs are.
TwinCities,3ay4yp,seahawks,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:46:29 2015 UTC,"I kind of want something that I can do physical stuff with, in the case something happens. Plus it would be convenient to have everything all in one place IMO."

TwinCities,3ay4yp,ScotWithOne_t,11,Thu Jun 25 02:56:21 2015 UTC,Just avoid TCF Bank. I use US Bank with no complaints.
TwinCities,3ay4yp,jhaake,4,Wed Jun 24 15:22:41 2015 UTC,What's wrong with TCF?  I've used them exclusively since I was a child.
TwinCities,3ay4yp,ScotWithOne_t,6,Wed Jun 24 17:47:31 2015 UTC,"Fees, lots of fees."
TwinCities,3ay4yp,jhaake,2,Wed Jun 24 17:58:44 2015 UTC,What kind of fees?  I have not paid TCF a single dime.
TwinCities,3ay4yp,SchruteFarmsInc,3,Wed Jun 24 18:08:24 2015 UTC,"Fees for withdrawing from their own ATMs (not AT the ATM mind you, but later in the month on my statement). For awhile until I realized it was getting fees for paper statements which I put a stop to.

TwinCities,3ay4yp,smokeyust,4,Wed Jun 24 21:31:55 2015 UTC,Topline credit union. Especially if you are looking at a loan. They have very good interest rates.
TwinCities,3ay4yp,beef_swellington,3,Wed Jun 24 15:47:22 2015 UTC,"Navy Federal and USAA are the best if you qualify. Otherwise, as stated before , Affinity is a good choice and I have heard Spire is good also."

TwinCities,3ay4yp,asterysk,4,Wed Jun 24 19:27:01 2015 UTC,My general opinion is that there's no such thing as a good bank. If it's not working for you (like a credit union) it's working against you.
TwinCities,3ay4yp,SchruteFarmsInc,2,Wed Jun 24 18:04:52 2015 UTC,"None.  Ditch your bank for good and get a credit union; unlike banks they're not out to make money off of you.    I have Wings Financial, but honestly I think any credit union is better than any bank."
TwinCities,3ay4yp,scootermcg,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:50:26 2015 UTC,I'm all for credit unions but let's not pretend they're not trying to make money off of you. At the end of the day they are a business like any other.
TwinCities,3ay4yp,Upscalebobcat28,2,Wed Jun 24 22:41:14 2015 UTC,Not for profit is a very significant difference.
TwinCities,3ay4yp,Upscalebobcat28,2,Thu Jun 25 04:05:06 2015 UTC,"Hi OP, I hope this response isn't too late, but I live in St. Louis Park, and am actually pretty passionate about this question. I use Citizens Independent Bank (over by the rec center, target, where highway 7 intersects Ottawa/beltline). They've never given me a heap of money or anything, but I have NEVER had a problem that they haven't resolved quickly, and their customer service is superb. To me, that's the most important thing in a bank.   You can cash checks via picture, transactions are posted for online banking super quickly, funds are available from a deposit to your checking account immediately, and they're open until noon on Saturday. There's probably more things I'm forgetting, but those are the features I use every week that make me really appreciate them. Feel free to ask me for any questions!"

TwinCities,3ay4yp,Kichigai,4,Thu Jun 25 01:09:38 2015 UTC,"A credit union.  Or if you're going for convenience and don't care quite so much about where your money sits, Wells Fargo and US Bank each have a shitton of ATMs in town.  Really depends on your needs though."

Then start checking banking locations and ATM locations against where you live, work, and play. A bank with an extra 0.25% APR on a savings account is worthless if you have to drive across town to get to it and the nearest ATM in the network is at the Mall of America in the food court."

To lessen the pain for those stuck holding the cards and to turn some people on to a great alternative, Ace Spirits will be offering $10 in store credit for any Four Firkins Gift Card. Sure, there are some limits- You need to make at least a $40 purchase, we limit it to one card per person per day and we reserve the right to terminate this program at any time.

If the business has filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the gift card holder must file a claim. In some cases, consumers might actually get at least part of the value of the gift card back. BBB advises consumers to redeem gift cards as soon as they are received to avoid possible problems down the road with the retailer’s solvency.""  So since they haven't filed for bankruptcy, they still have to accept the cards.  And if they do file, you can still make a claim to at least recoup some of the cash."

The gift card didn't go very far and I didn't feel like they had much more than other places like Surdyk's.  Also, these days I'm more likely to support a local brewery and go buy a growler.

That often leads them to realize that they can't build the product with what they raised and call it quits, without ever delivering.  You also generally get lower quality products from these crowd sourced efforts. They often don't have access to the design teams and other resources products go through when being brought to market the traditional way. These are the folks that look at how to make a product better and test everything to death before it hits the market. Some crowd sourced products take that extra time, but the vast majority don't seem to bother and simply go from idea and prototype to finding someone to build it, while skipping the middle stages."

TwinCities,3awa2l,autobahn,6,Wed Jun 24 14:30:31 2015 UTC,"Not accepting credit cards means probably they're bailing on their bank, and don't want to run any more transactions through there because that would just put a slight dent in a large negative balance that they're not planning on paying off anyway.   And not redeeming gift cards is just a pure douche move. ""Thanks for all your business, loyal customers. Now fuck off"".   Good riddance.

TwinCities,3awa2l,Eslader,8,Wed Jun 24 12:35:39 2015 UTC,"Crap, that sucks. My favorite beer store.  What did they mean by competition from grocery stores?"
TwinCities,3awa2l,autobahn,19,Wed Jun 24 01:16:43 2015 UTC,They mean that their business model was entirely based on the fact that other stores weren't stocking craft beer.

TwinCities,3awa2l,doesnotreadusername,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:16:22 2015 UTC,"Blue Max doesn't cater exclusively to the craft beer scene.  Blue max sells wine and liquor, which I am guessing carry a pretty high margin.  Blue max also sells mass-market beer. It is not uncommon to see people walking out with cases of Heineken or whatever."
TwinCities,3awa2l,TheMacMan,7,Wed Jun 24 13:41:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe that was their problem. Selling macro beer, wine and spirits is what makes up the vast majority of the profits at most liquor stores and what allows them to have great craft beer selections which while they do have a higher profit margin (typically 25-35%) they also move much slower. You have to move a lot of craft beer to make up for the high volume of macro beer and spirits that most liquor stores sell.  My guess would be this is the real reason they were hurting financially."
TwinCities,3awa2l,Rimm,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:01:28 2015 UTC,"Actually, selling the macro stuff at a fair price doesn't grab much profit due to competition.  It's what brings people in the door and hopefully they grab something that does make them money.  FF never tried to go after price shoppers on the macro stuff, instead going after the hipster beer crowd.  It worked for a while, but they failed to adapt."
TwinCities,3awa2l,DaveIsLame2,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:13:50 2015 UTC,"As myself and others said, macro has less profit margin but you move a hell of a lot more of it, which is where they make the money. Say you make $1 on every pack of craft beer but only 50¢ on macro. Macro sells at 10x the rate of craft so you make it up with volume.  FF charged at least $1-2 more for every sixer of craft than others in town so they took in an additional profit there. But over time, people realized this and started shopping elsewhere (based on the comments here). So they saw less volume, even if they saw a higher profit per sale."
TwinCities,3awa2l,Rimm,4,Thu Jun 25 10:43:13 2015 UTC,"But so what?  Even though they carry other stuff(great scotch collection), they always had a WAY bigger selection of craft and foreign beers."
TwinCities,3awa2l,DaveIsLame2,3,Wed Jun 24 14:02:16 2015 UTC,"So they serve a bigger market, not a niche like FF."
TwinCities,3awa2l,xenokira,5,Wed Jun 24 14:38:51 2015 UTC,And at the same time cater to the beer niche better than four firkins.

TwinCities,3awa2l,Kruse,7,Wed Jun 24 01:23:57 2015 UTC,Not to mention that it seems like a lot of these types of liquor stores have really stepped up their craft beer game over the last couple years.
TwinCities,3awa2l,Eslader,5,Wed Jun 24 01:54:51 2015 UTC,And those Total Wine (or whatever they're called) stores.
TwinCities,3awa2l,Kruse,2,Wed Jun 24 04:00:16 2015 UTC,"Total Wine has to scare the shit out of almost every liquor store.  Their prices are substantially lower than most anywhere else, their selection is enormous, and the staff is surprisingly knowledgeable."
TwinCities,3awa2l,Eslader,3,Wed Jun 24 14:48:08 2015 UTC,"I know there was a lot of push back against Total Wine opening stores around MN from smaller liquor stores. Many seemed to call it the ""Wal-Mart"" of liquor stores and therefore inherently evil because they'll put the small stores out of business. So far, I've seen no reason for those accusations. Every experience I've had in one has been positive-- good prices, lots of samples to try, reasonably knowledgeable staff, massive selection, clean, and well organized.  If places like Total Wine are giving stores like MGM a run for their money--good. Either step-up your game or move on."
TwinCities,3awa2l,lettuce,3,Wed Jun 24 16:21:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you have to be careful with that. Walmart was the same way when it first started getting big. Great prices, great selection, clean, etc etc. And now that they've run a lot of the mom and pop stores out of town, which they did by getting big enough that they could negotiate better wholesale prices for themselves than Joe's Hardware could possibly get, and therefore they could undersell the little guys easily, they're a parasite that subsidizes their business via the taxpayers.  When you pay your workers so little that they have to go on public assistance, what you're really doing is using taxpayers to take care of your expenses for you while you pocket the profit.   I don't know that TW is doing this yet, but if they drive all of their competition out of business and get truly huge like Walmart did, it wouldn't at all surprise me if they start doing it."
TwinCities,3awa2l,mrpeterandthepuffers,3,Wed Jun 24 17:06:40 2015 UTC,"I completely see your point, but I think because of Total Wine's very nature (a liquor store and nothing else), it will never reach the levels of destruction that Wal-Mart has caused."
TwinCities,3awa2l,jangadance,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:12:01 2015 UTC,"No, because Walmart has driven locals from almost every retail segment out of business. But TW certainly does threaten local liquor stores, and once it gets rid of all of them, it can do whatever it wants as far as pricing, selection, etc."
TwinCities,3awa2l,DaddyHeadbone,2,Wed Jun 24 17:14:19 2015 UTC,"No, because someone else will outcompete them if they fail at pricing, selection, etc.  Wal-Mart is famous for pressuring their suppliers into cheapening their products so they can undercut the competition. I've never heard of Total Wine cajoling a supplier into brewing an exclusive lower quality beer so they can sell the brand less than Joe's Liquor Mart down the way."
TwinCities,3awa2l,jondraws,2,Wed Jun 24 21:48:49 2015 UTC,"Not sure how true it is but I've heard that the reason Total Wine can charge less is because they're willing to take a smaller margin on product than the little guys, not that they're negotiating wholesale discounts.   They make up for the smaller margin by moving more volume. I go into Total Wine from time to time but I also visit ""mom & pop"" stores as well. If an m&p has a better selection or better customer service I'll certainly use them, but if I know I just need a couple of 4 packs of Surly I'm gonna go to Total Wine since they're a buck cheaper each."

They were a specialty store that couldn't keep up once craft beer went mainstream."
TwinCities,3awa2l,TheMacMan,3,Wed Jun 24 18:15:51 2015 UTC,Wow that was really quick. They have only been in their new location for a couple years now.  I didn't realize they had a second store though.

TwinCities,3awa2l,cyrilspaceman,9,Wed Jun 24 14:43:53 2015 UTC,In Minneapolis you have Stinson and Zipps which both have wonderful selections and prices. St Paul has Ale Jail and Heritage in Maplewood. Dennis Brother's is just a bit south of St Paul in Cottage Grove and has awesome selection and prices. Don't forget Princeton's in Maple Grove which has a wonderful selection too. Tons of great beer options around the Twin Cities.

TwinCities,3awa2l,Eslader,2,Wed Jun 24 03:21:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly!  It doesn't add up.   I'm sad to see them go under, but it is really easy to find good beer even at the chains, now.    My favorite liquor store is South Lyndale Liquors.  Great beer selection, but the best part about them is their sample shelf of spirits.  They have people on hand to help you choose the right bottle, based on your preferences.  They were very helpful in my introduction to scotch."
TwinCities,3awa2l,junkeee999,5,Wed Jun 24 04:25:08 2015 UTC,I shopped there quite a bit and never got any attitude.  They were always quite helpful with recommendations and such.

I would visit the St. Louis Park location semi-frequently, but after they opened the second location the stock at the SLP store seemed to be reduced and less varied. I stopped going as often after that.  The choice of Oakdale for the second location makes me think they might have been going all-in on Sunday sales getting passed - maybe they figured the people on the East-end of town that would make Sunday beer runs to Wisconsin would go to their store instead if it were legalized in Minnesota?  Overall, I'll miss them. Their free tasting events were always really cool and I liked the staff. I never experienced or witnessed employees talking down or being snobs to people... so I don't really know where that sentiment is coming from in this thread. Plus they were super dog-friendly, which is always a plus for me, personally.   Refusing to honor gift cards is really low, though."

If you enjoy the outdoors and want to check out the city then I'd suggest ponying up $6 and renting a Nice Ride. It'll get you around the city faster than Metro Transit, and you can find docks using the Spotcycle app.  That can get you through a lot of the parks, around the Chain of Lakes, and over and around Downtown and Nordeast for food."

If you are an REI member, they will rent boats/paddles/PFDs overnight for a reasonable rate; I can't remember which locations have rentals, but the Bloomington store would be your best bet.  As for watching the fireworks, it shouldn't be packed either on the river or on the lakes, but if I were you I'd post up on a rooftop somewhere, or hang out on the Stone Arch Bridge."

TwinCities,3auji0,kirby056,2,Tue Jun 23 17:36:52 2015 UTC,I personally would never go out on the water after dark without proper lighting on your boat (I believe it's also illegal). I think it was just last year that a couple people were killed on Mille Lacs when two boat collided right after dusk. I know the chances of YOU hitting someone are pretty non-existent. You sit in the water so low though that without lights I don't think you would be readily visible. As for just renting Minnetonka would be fun but packed. If you are willing to just hang out on a smaller lake I believe Silver Lake in New Brighton/Saint Anthony does rentals.

I go to school in Phoenix and spend lots of time in downtown Phoenix. Minneapolis/ St. Paul follow the same suit as downtown Phoenix for the most part. The problem with Maple Grove in my opinion is that is is mostly your classic ""white"" families who are more worried about taking the kids to soccer practice, working to pay the bills and keep their entitled children happy. I could see there being a problem with people just not going there. With MG being expensive to live it is many new families rather than singles who want to go out.

Listen, I like beer, love it but let's be honest, the craft beer market is oversaturated and extremely difficult to break into. It's arguable that we are in a craft beer bubble and have been for some time. In addition, bigger breweries are also starting to offer beer selections that were normally reserved for craft beers and smaller breweries are now commercializing on a level that makes them almost macro brews (Sierra Nevada and Rogue for example, still great beer but far from their original marketing roots).   If you want to see how craft beer needs to work, look at Lucid, Indeed, Steel Toe, hell even Surley. All of these started small and grew - it's still a crapshot if I can get Steel Toe and Lucid at most breweries. Surley is just about everywhere and Indeed is catching up; you really can't just open a million dollar brewery and hope it works.   I wish them the best, but start small and grow."

TwinCities,3arxho,TheLZ,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:02:48 2015 UTC,"I've been going since the early 00's and a lot has changed with this convention.  Started out very mellow and more about the community aspect and such, and felt very much like nerd summer camp.  Everyone knew each other and when bad shit went down, it was dealt with swiftly and respectfully to all parties.    However within the last 5 years word had spread and population doubled.  It definitely became overrun by people in their teens and early 20's wanting to make it more of a sexy party than what it used to be.  I remember 2-3 years ago we'd see ambulances showing up on the regular every night taking away kids and cops appearing more often.    This was a huge concern for me personally and I almost stopped going because I'm just not interested in the party side of the convention.  However last year I saw them take a lot more enforcement against creepers, underage drinking (all party rooms checked IDs last year), ""secret"" kink parties, and generally over-the-top behavior.  I've seen ""regulars"" get kicked out of the convention when they normally would have been free-and-clear to behave badly in years prior.    I do think the Convergence staff wants very much to bring things back to the way it used to be, and discourage the over-the-top craziness of recent years.  This year's schedule is crammed with family friendly events and I feel hopeful that this year could see a bit more of a shift.  I worry about what you say about pick pockets and the rapes last year.  This is the first I'd heard of either.  It's so important for friends and family to stick together to keep unfortunate things from happening to their loved ones at large events.  I personally bring teenaged nieces to the convention and I watch them like a hawk every year.    Sadly, I've heard about similar complaints about Anime Detour, and seems that whenever you get 8,000-10,000 people crammed into a hotel it draws out the shitty people looking to pray on the vulnerable.  If things don't continue a more positive trend this year, I'll seriously consider not going back."
TwinCities,3arxho,meatwhisper,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:20:14 2015 UTC,"Jesus, I didn't know there were these kinds of things going on at Convergence.  I have several friends on Facebook who go every year and I never see them mention anything about this awful stuff (and some of them I would think would mention it in a FB post, but they haven't).  I remember some leering and catcalling at Anime Detour the one time I went in 2009, so I am not totally surprised I guess, but didn't know there was this bad of stuff."
TwinCities,3arxho,WadeK,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:16:27 2015 UTC,"This is the first I've heard of the pickpocketing or rapes as well. I don't doubt it happened, and it's extraordinarily unfortunate that it did. But out of nearly 7000 people attending, it's still relatively safe. There are staff about every 50 yards, as well as several in every panel or party room that will call security or even the police for you, as well as offering a safe space. The anti-groping culture is getting pretty awesome, and ""Costumes are not Consent"" has been gaining lots of traction. Call someone out for being creepy, if you're in a crowd then I can just about bet you'll have backup.    If you are concerned about safety, I would suggest emailing the convention and asking about the incidents (they won't give you details, but they may tell you what they'll do to stop future ones). Unfortunately, pickpocketing isn't something that the con themselves can do much to stop besides asking everyone to watch their things and report, report, report. Same with any sexual assault. Watch your drinks, make sure your friends know where you are and if something happens in the hotel rooms where there is no staff or witnesses, then you need to report it as soon as possible.    I have felt far safer at Convergence than at Detour or any other con of it's size. I think the amount of kid-friendly panels and activities have started to attract better people and a less rowdy (dangerously rowdy anyways) crowd than Detour. And the amount of talking tos that us party rooms get by staff, security, the hotel and the actual police keep the parties pretty safe, even if they get wild.    But again, Convergence itself cannot police what happens in every private hotel room. They can only stop what's happening in the areas they control."

TwinCities,3apcjw,Kichigai,2,Mon Jun 22 16:04:14 2015 UTC,Right - if everyone has to stop then that's a traffic circle which is less efficient.  The whole point of the roundabout is in the best case you just drive right into the circle with only a minor slowdown.

I grew up in Champlin and they have put in several of them over the last 4-5 years and people still have no clue how to use them after being there for years now."
TwinCities,3apcjw,nwnokomis,4,Mon Jun 22 16:03:09 2015 UTC,"The thing people hate about roundabouts is what makes them so effective, they take effort to navigate though. When people are a little afraid of hitting something they pay attention and the crash rates and the severity of those crashes goes way way down.   I think it's a huge problem that we basically expect driving to be easy and conducted largely on auto pilot. Driving should feel a little scary because it is a very dangerous activity. With many big roads and intersections, you feel like if you just follow the lights and lines you will be fine ... until you get t-boned at 45+ mph."
TwinCities,3apcjw,Kichigai,2,Mon Jun 22 16:07:23 2015 UTC,"Interesting, because I'm hearing different arguments against roundabouts.  There's the typical argument that nobody knows how to use them, therefore they're dangerous (which is dumb; in my experience when people come up to some new traffic control system they tend to use an abundance of caution, and then they are forced to learn) but the other one I've heard is that they're too small/slow.  Now I have seen traffic circles in other states that were way too small, and some that are gigantic (like this one) and I must say that I agree to a degree that we should be looking into larger traffic circles in some area, but to complain they're too slow is just asinine, especially when the traffic circle has replaced a stop sign. I mean, which do you think impedes the flow of traffic more? A traffic circle or a 4-way stop?  But it floors me that someone is complaining about being unable to go around a traffic circle at speeds greater than 15MPH. I mean, first off, unless you're going to kick some people out of their homes and completely redesign and rebuild a bridge there's no way to install a traffic circle large enough to do 30MPH the whole way 'round. But the idea that traffic needs to go fast through these areas just seems dumb. Even if it was just a 2-way stop before you ought to be driving slow enough to make sure no one is going to blow through the stop sign and smash into you. And we're talking about one small intersection no less. Most of the time you're in and out of the traffic circle in like ten seconds, tops. You can't tolerate slowing down for a few seconds?"
TwinCities,3apcjw,nwnokomis,3,Mon Jun 22 18:10:48 2015 UTC,"People have a very hard time putting a value on average trip time vs high speeds. So driving fast between stoplight feels better, even though you end up waiting several minutes at full stop which on average results in a slower trip.   Even if it was slower however I would still be for them when done right since I personally place a high value on people not being needlessly killed. So much of our traffic design has been built with the sole purpose of moving people through as fast as possible often at the cost of life. People think it's inevitable when it is the direct result of bad design."
TwinCities,3apcjw,Kichigai,3,Mon Jun 22 20:29:13 2015 UTC,"So much of our traffic design has been built with the sole purpose of moving people through as fast as possible often at the cost of life   This attitude about speed has so many other impacts too. Look back at the thing about letting soccer moms decide where we should have bike lanes. It basically says ""we can't waste time walking a block from the parking lot!"" It's the same attitude that feeds into road rage and informs people who avoid mass transit because it's ""too slow"" (well, it is, but that's mostly because of the hub/spoke route maps we're using now, but nothing inherent to transit itself).  I don't mind driving, and I kind of enjoy it, but if I'm going to be stuck in traffic one way or another I'd much rather be on the bus. When the weather is bad I don't even bother with trying to drive, I just haul my ass down to the bus stop and get out my Go To card. I end up getting to work in about the same amount of time, except I'm much more relaxed. Sure, my phone's battery suffers from streaming Morning Edition and me reading stuff on it the whole time, but that's why I bring a charger with me to work.  IMHO, people need to learn how to slow their roll. At what expense are we pursuing speed? On the extreme, yes, it's at the cost of some peoples' lives, but on the mundane is it worth the stress we put into achieving it every day of our lives? I mean, not to make light of how dangerously designed some of our roads and intersections are, but this isn't an either/or thing. If we change the attitudes of people we can have both safer roadways and better quality of life."

TwinCities,3apcjw,M03b1u5,10,Tue Jun 23 00:45:42 2015 UTC,I totally love driving around these things. The significant increase in safety easily outweighs the increased cost per intersection.

TwinCities,3apcjw,matthewmpls,7,Mon Jun 22 14:01:45 2015 UTC,I found this article that talks about the cost.  But it is unclear whether the cost is $250K for one stop light or for the entire intersection.  Had no idea that roads are that expensive.
TwinCities,3apcjw,AlaskanPipeline04,-7,Mon Jun 22 14:14:29 2015 UTC,Well you gotta pay the 20-30 road workers it takes to do the job. 5 or so actually doing the work while the remaining puff down cigarettes and watch. It's tough.

Arrive for rescheduled appointment to be informed that the therapist they had assigned me didn't accept a nuance of the type of insurance I had but I could reschedule with one of the other therapists some days later that would.  I know the clinic is a business, and they have rent and people to pay, but felt like they should answer the phone with"" Hello, associated clinic, where's the money coming from"".  I guess they just get inured to dealing with people in pain. I got more warmth and concern from my insurance company person who explained my benefits to me then the place that was supposed to help me.

TwinCities,3arcdv,gAlienLifeform,2,Mon Jun 22 21:54:06 2015 UTC,"Webster accuses the city of withholding, concealing, even likely destroying data.   Withholding and concealing? OK, I can easily see that. ""Likely destroying""? That seems a bit less likely to me. That's a pretty big no-no compared to refusal to hand over records and if proven would be extremely bad for everyone involved. On the other hand, withholding and concealing is one of those things where people tend to just get a slap on the wrist for.  While this does seem to be some pretty shady stuff on the part of the city of Bloomington, it all hinges on whether or not they're violating the state's Data Practices laws, and this may in fact be legal depending on what data Tony Webster (who seems to have quite a decent looking history as a citizen journalist) has been denied access to.  According to 13.03, subdivision 1, the government is obligated to hand over data ""unless classified by statute, or temporary classification pursuant to section 13.06, or federal law, as nonpublic or protected nonpublic, or with respect to data on individuals, as private or confidential."" 13.06 Subdivision 3(2) states that an application for making data not-public may be made if ""public access to the data would render unworkable a program authorized by law."" And that brings me back to this paragraph from the KARE11 reporting:   Black Lives Matter activists allege that Bloomington Police infiltrated the organization by sending undercover officers to attend planning meetings and creating a fake Facebook account to friend protest organizers and monitor their activities.   If information on that program is what's being sought out then that may be rendered as non-public (or at least a case for it to be made non-public could be argued) as it would interfere with those operations going forward into the future.  Now, it's also possible that everything I've said here is completely irrelevant in this case, but the lack of details in the KARE11 reporting here makes it hard to know for sure. It should be interesting to see how this one shakes out, because if the city is in violation of Data Practices law, we should know about it."

What if Frei's bullet had struck a bystander while he was being chased? Or worse: if the officer's bullet struck a bystander? You better believe Walmart would place all the blame on the officer for having escalated the situation.  Not only that, but I know people who worked in that area on University (and had to deal with shoplifters), and unless Walmart owns that whole lot (which I doubt) then employees are not supposed to pursue shoplifters beyond the front door. Beyond that threshold they are no longer on the company's property, and they are not entitled to pursue them any further.  Now I'm not trying to make a judgement call about whether the officer was right or wrong to pursue Frei, but I'd wager they violated a lot of company policy and will get shitcanned for it."

The day I moved in that place, a man got shot 10 feet away from my front door. University and Dale had the Belmont and the Faust (basically brothels).  Now, it's cleaned up a bit from what it was, however, it's still got drug dealers on corners, lots of petty theft, vandalism, etc. Things that you don't have lingering around the Maple Grove Wal-Mart. Ever notice how businesses in the midway seem to come and go? (Borders, Mervyns, Herbergers, etc.) they're theft rate is INSANELY high. Just ask anybody who worked there, it's a huge issue.

TwinCities,3amiea,DeadDoug,2,Mon Jun 22 14:35:48 2015 UTC,Public employees already have ways to hold their employer accountable.  Far more than any private employee in fact.  Instead of focusing on what is actually best for the educational effort of schools we must always treat it like a jobs program.  Online options?  Not if it reduces the number of teachers! There are many many arguments against the teacher's union but they all come out to the same basic point:  They are a roadblock to progress.

TwinCities,3amiea,DeadDoug,-6,Mon Jun 22 16:57:45 2015 UTC,"They're everywhere dude.  EVERYWHERE. That shit's public record. Also, working in mortgage, seeing loan apps from across the country six figure incomes are not rare at all for teachers.  It's same with cops and military, enough people said these well paid professions are underpaid that it started to be believed by the masses. Edit: according to salary.com, median for teachers in Minneapolis is $55K.  Yep, they're destitute.  And that is nowhere near the range I mentioned.  Especially when you throw out the new, untenured teachers.  OH WAIT!  lol"
TwinCities,3amiea,bobpuller,3,Mon Jun 22 19:12:11 2015 UTC,"55k is fairly low for a mid career salary that requires a 4 year degree and looking up teachers in general is very misleading as it probably includes professors which can make a good living (but still significantly underpaid for their qualifications)  Here's a better link The median salary for elementary school teachers is at 42k and high school is at 47k. So for a teacher to make the claimed 60-70k you likely need a PHD and be employed as a professor at a University.  Though, I do believe that you tend to see a lot of mortgage applications from people making that much that are employed at schools just that they likely do administrative work rather than teach."
TwinCities,3amiea,forgetfulburglar,-2,Tue Jun 23 00:58:54 2015 UTC,"No, you just need a master's to make $60K.  I looked up salaries for my old high school a few years ago when I was bored.  First ring suburb, not wealthy.  Like I said, all public record.  Also when the application says ""teacher"" they are probably not superintendent or principal. As for professors, adjunct/part time profs get screwed yes.  But full time professors get paid EXTREMMMMELY handsomely.  Trust me on this one. And no, $55k is not low when you factor in the time off and benefits and early retirement..."

The story is so vague that it's impossible to be sure. But it sounds like the dealerships in question had a contract with ROC, and then ROC had a contract with the company that employs these four people.  So unless they own the company they work for, I'm not sure how they can go after ROC, since the company lost the contract, or is there some kind of weird thing where they're employees on loan or some weird bullshit like that?

TwinCities,3ac4ej,Kichigai,2,Fri Jun 19 16:57:22 2015 UTC,"I'm a guy and I've been there a few times. It has the atmosphere of an ordinary book store, so yeah, it's pretty chill. I might still wear the sunglasses, though, as it's a sunny day and you should have some UV protection going on. Seriously, though, don't worry. Looking at a few of the items on display might give you the idea that the place has a bit of an LGBT bend to it, but they cater to just as many straight people as they do people who are not so don't let that put you off.  Seriously, though, it's the least judgmental place I've ever been to in my entire life. It might seem super awkward walking up to one of the employees and asking them a question, but after talking to them for a bit you'll quickly relax. Their whole business is making sex fun and safe, and getting you all uptight is not good for business. Remember: the employees buy and use these same items, as well as anyone who's in a relationship with them (I know at least a few of them have boyfriends), so why would they judge you for buying these things when they do it too?  As others have noted, it's a little pricey (~10-20% more expensive than Amazon), but you're paying for convenience and a knowledgeable staff. And they do know their stuff. It's a little weird to be asking a woman about an item intended for use by a man, but a lot of them are in relationships with men who give them feedback on this stuff. So in my opinion having that kind of resource makes it worth the premium.  Just don't go in there expecting to spend on cheap junk. If it ain't good it ain't on their shelves, which means you're looking at mid to higher end pricing. So yeah, you'll be spending some cash, but it's good value for money. And if the price tag puts you off, think of it this way: how much do you spend on a night out with friends? Or on a new video game/accessory/DLC? The ratio of enjoyment to dollar is going to be in that same ballpark, so why cheap out?"

I mean, yeah, there's reviews and whatnot, but at least if you go to the store you can see the item in person (they have display models of most everything, and if not usually will open a box for you) so you can get an idea of the size, texture, weight, the strength of any vibration, how hard the batteries are to change/charge, how pliable something is, etc. etc.  At least using the store as a showroom is worth your time."

TwinCities,3aago9,MrsTiggyWiggy,16,Thu Jun 18 17:11:32 2015 UTC,"I also like to bike with my kids.   I can't even count the number of people I see out on bikes with their kids. Typically not on the road (unless it's one of those tag-along units that's tethered to the seat-post, or a trailer) but I still see a ton of them out there, and even more during big biking events like the St. Paul Classic.   But parent-provided vehicles aren’t in the cards for our family. Biking is a really sensible way for teenagers to get around. It’s cheap, it’s good exercise, and it broadens the range of places and people they can access.   Not only this, but younger folks are trending away from driving. My sister is absolutely satisfied to be taking the bus everywhere, and not only that, but Metro Transit ridership is rising. For me, riding the bus is a major inconvenience due to the local schedule, but adding a bike into the mix makes it a (mostly) viable way for me to commute. It would be for my sister as well, if she had space to store a bike in her apartment.  In the suburb I live in there are no bike lanes, however we are fortunate enough to have a large number of low-traffic streets, and the higher-trafficked streets are broad and have a relatively low speed limit (35MPH). We're home to two public elementary schools, one public high school, and a couple religious schools.  There are a ton of kids (from I'd, say, age 6 to age 18) who are out and about on bicycles (and thankfully people out here keep an eye out for them). Some of them are just out riding around for fun, on the sidewalks and alleys, but a lot of them use it for getting around. They're going to school. They're going to one of the parks. They're going to the Dairy Queen. They're going to the game shop. They're going to the convenience store. They're going to their friend's homes. They're going to their grandparents' homes.

TwinCities,3aago9,_UNDERSCOREBEFORE,4,Thu Jun 18 21:48:47 2015 UTC,It's mostly because of connectivity.

West of University and closer to Hilltop were troublesome when I lived there, but may have changed.  If you are planning on having children I would not recommend the school district, lots of flip-flopping policies. Most recently they enforced a uniform policy at the middle school.

They have half priced shakes after 8PM during the summer. There are some pretty nice Middle Eastern-ish restaurants around there (not sure on the exact nationalities). The Heights theatre is pretty cool if you like watching movies in incredibly old theaters. They do a lot of older movies from every time period plus newer releases. They also do a lot of artsy movies since they join up with places like the Trylon and the Walker.

I think the cheapest one I saw was about $13k."
TwinCities,3abmyh,alle0441,2,Fri Jun 19 02:38:55 2015 UTC,"Buy it on craigslist. This type of car gets low ball trade in offers because bigger dealers don't want it on their lot. It goes to auction and there are two transportation fees, an auction fee, etc. In my case the dealer offered me 30% of blue book value for my trade in. So I discounted it $500 below blue book and sold it in one day on CL. Didn't have to insure it any more. Didn't take the low ball offer. Didn't have to repeatedly meet up with strangers.  Edit: when I looked for competing vehicles, dealers were always 20% above kbb. Private parties were usually right at kbb. A private party doesn't have the overhead found at a dealer, usually will have maintenance records, and really only has to beat the low ball trade in offer to be happy."

TwinCities,3abmyh,KaKaKylie,2,Sun Jun 21 02:59:16 2015 UTC,"Like u/vteclove said, get your financing done through a credit union. Rates are MUCH better than a big bank.  Keep in mind that if you buy from a properly licensed dealer, the car you buy may qualify for a 60 or 30 day warranty: http://www.ag.state.mn.us/consumer/Handbooks/MNCarLaws/MNCarLaws_2.asp  You assume full risk when buying from a private party but you generally get a better deal than going to a dealership.  I like Poquet Auto, as u/alle0441 mentioned. I would stay away from cars that have salvaged or rebuilt titles. You may get a better deal buying one of these cars, but you might get a junker that was repaired poorly. I'd stick with buying a car that has a clean title and has no history of accidents. There's no need to be buying a salvaged or rebuilt car with your budget.  As far as makes and models, I'm preferential to the Japanese manufacturers. Specifically Honda and Toyota. They make high-quality cars that are some of the most durable cars out there.  Keep in mind a used car will need more maintenance than a brand new car. Try to set aside $50 each month for maintenance and repair. Whenever something breaks, you have a little safety net to cover the repair.  Good luck with your search!"

Might sound surprising, but there you go.  The line at Sea Salt at Minnehaha Falls can be a little alarming, but if they like fish/shrimp, the kid's basket is quite legitimate. No pandering -- they get two big fish planks (or some shrimp) with fruit. Same fish adults get, smaller portion.

Now all y'all on this thread seem pretty excited for this, and I see my residence in NE is like one house away from being in one of these circles. Helpful USI rep: is lowered speed during peak use times still an issue? Thread lurkers: would you switch from Comcast's predictable service (which comes with HBO Go) for $66 a month to city wireless for $26 (supposedly comparable speed) if it were unpredictable and didn't have the added benefit of a Dothraki khalasar?

TwinCities,3a6fez,DocChachi,4,Wed Jun 17 21:34:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, fiber will be there in the next few years, for now TDM will be our offering and we will convert everyone to fiber for free when it is available."
TwinCities,3a6fez,DustUpDustOff,2,Wed Jun 17 21:56:34 2015 UTC,ELI5: why aren't you speeding up the process of adding fiber to new neighborhoods? People HATE Comcast; expanding to more customers seems like such a low hanging fruit for you.
TwinCities,3a6fez,araezo,4,Thu Jun 18 01:06:15 2015 UTC,Running fiber cost money and is a huge task. Even after running the main fiber you have to hook up each house. This is a small company rolling this out as fast as they are capable.  I'm hopeful that the TDM wireless will be stable and fast enought to move too until fiber gets here but I have yet to see any real world reviews.

TwinCities,3a6fez,reallynotnick,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:22:19 2015 UTC,"The old chicken/egg problem. We don't get upgrades quickly because we don't have subscribers, but we dont have subscribers because there isn't service available."
TwinCities,3a6fez,Whovian4291,2,Thu Jun 18 16:58:10 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say that exactly applies here as you've had the 6mb/s service just like the other areas with a lot of subscribers. They are just prioritizing their existing customers over new customers which I think is completely fair.
TwinCities,3a6fez,reallynotnick,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:22:03 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree that they should prioritize existing customers.  And when I said service isn't available, i really should say there's no need for people on this side to get USI wireless because it couldn't compete with CL or Comcast.  So we don't have users so we dont have the upgrade, but there's still not going to be many users because there's less incentive to get the service without the upgrade."
TwinCities,3a6fez,igacek,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:01:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't know how they compete anywhere before the upgrade as all those places have Comcast and CL (though I hate both so I sort of understand).

TwinCities,3a6fez,Grimalkin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:00:14 2015 UTC,"Oooh. Sorry. When it rolls out near you, you'll probably need to get apartment permission to mount a receiver outside your apartment. In other words, if they won't get fiber, I'm guessing they won't let you install a receiver for this wifi.  But that's just my guess. If it's correct, in short it doesn't affect you."

Even the lowest 25Mbps tier is faster than what I had with Comcast for the price (particularly upload speed), and so far USI's service has had better uptime than my broken-ass router and PC, so I can't complain about that either.  If your building doesn't have it installed already, the wait can be a while though."

TwinCities,3a2l26,BadDreamInc,3,Tue Jun 16 22:23:11 2015 UTC,"Now, let me preface this by saying I know of many gals that had kids at a young age that worked their asses off and gave their kids great lives. Being a young parent isn't always a terrible idea.  What IS a terrible idea, (and what I keep seeing over and over in cases like this) is these girls who think their new, young, inexperienced boyfriends should be babysitting their kids. I keep seeing it over and over. The moms at work, 19 year old boyfriend can't get the baby to stop crying, so he starts beating it. (Which in itself is stupid. ""Oh the baby won't stop crying? Let's injure it! That'll make it stop!"" ) For some reason these girls think these young men love their kids as much as they do, a feel perfectly comfortable leaving them home all day.  That's what I don't get. Young men don't want to sit at home with a baby all day. Chances are, the only reason they're doing it, is because they think it'll help them get laid when mom gets home.   There are SO many resources available to people now. Daycare assistance is available. Why are they leaving their kids with their boyfriends?! Its like they want to play family SO badly, they ignore the fact that these boys aren't interested in playing house, or that their kids have bruises, or are afraid of the new boyfriend, etc. These young mothers need to put their kids first, and worry about a boyfriend later.   Sorry for the rambling rant. It's just so sad."

I think they don't notice warning signs because they're desperate to have a man, or think they're in love. This case in particular, even the father noticed bruises on the child, and reported them, shortly before this tragedy. Why wasn't the mother all over that? These are the kinds of things I mean.

Then to go on to say many young males only pretend to be a father to get laid by baby momma? Absurd post and I don't know where you get these ideas about young males. Do you have any credible source on any of these statements you just made? A single 17 year old boy is not representative of all young fathers. Your post screams ""quick to judge middle aged person"" and as a young male who is not a father but someone who wouldn't ""pretend to play father"" to get laid  let alone beat my kids or stomp on them I'm kind of offended. I will concede that unplanned pregnancies at a young age are not always conducive to the best family situations, however whatever you just tried to point out about young people is utterly ridiculous."

TwinCities,3a1c2c,ZKXX,-3,Tue Jun 16 23:29:24 2015 UTC,"Edit: It looks like I've been the target of a downvote brigade, possibly from /r/oralprofessionals, a private sub, or maybe from another dental community. I encourage anyone reading this to do their own research on this issue. The dental community, oral surgeons in particular, have a lot of turf to protect and I would guess that they take any threat to this turf extremely seriously. Yugenol paints the below post as ""factually inaccurate"", but I stand by this post. Like I said, this is an interesting and serious issue where the financial interest of dentists may not completely align with the safety of their patients. This edit will probably subject me to more attempts from the dentists to censor such conversations, and I think that only illustrates the need to think critically about why they would want to do so.  I think it's worth it for the public to know that oral surgeons routinely give their own anesthesia and simultaneously perform whatever procedure is being done. This is practically unheard of for any other type of provider; virtually all other surgeries are performed with a dedicated anesthesia provider such as an anesthesiologist or a nurse anesthetist. Oral surgeons do not receive near as extensive training in anesthesia as either of these two professionals. I would not be at all surprised if this was a case of too much sedation and the oral surgeon not properly maintaining the patient's airway, leading to cardiac arrest, or not knowing how to manage an unexpected complication. The details in the article are suspicious; it paints the scenario as an ""unknown cardiac condition"" or something similar but that doesn't really add up, in my opinion.  As to why oral surgeons both give anesthesia and perform the procedure, I suspect it is a combination of saving money and overconfidence.  That being said, there is always a risk of death when receiving anesthesia, even with a skilled provider. That risk is very, very small in a healthy person."
TwinCities,3a1c2c,anonanes,32,Tue Jun 16 16:56:35 2015 UTC,"I really dislike how you're throwing members of my profession under the bus with your generalising and factually inaccurate statements. Look at the rate of complications for elective surgeries and compare to that of third molar extractions (and even then, some are only nominally elective). This story was newsworthy because it was 1) a common surgery with a very uncommon complication and 2) about a local, young, healthy girl (who, as you stated, can still develop complications).  Please note that, while anaesthesia was never mentioned in the above article, there are varying levels. For the sake of simplification, we can separate them into conscious sedation and deep sedation (general). Most people aren't aware of the differences and lump them under ""going under"".    Conscious sedation involves anxiolytic and sedative drugs, making patients feel more relaxed and generally more cooperative/less fidgety, but still responsive to verbal prompts and physical stimuli (why we still give local anaesthesia).  General anaesthesia is the process of actually rendering a patient unconscious to perform the procedure. Due to the induction of respiratory depression, patients are intubated to maintain airway patency.   Because of the amnesic effect of popular drugs, unless you read which one they're going to do (and it's mostly a level of conscious or slightly deeper), you won't remember the actual procedure of anaesthesia.   Most third molar extractions are performed under a form of conscious sedation. All Minnesota oral surgeons, and dentists for that matter, who, have obtained licensure from the Board to perform conscious or deep sedation are certified Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) practitioners. That means that, yes, they are qualified to manage an unexpected complication. Additionally, assistants or nurse anaesthetists with direct patient involvement on sedation cases must be certified in delivering sedative drugs through an IV and aiding in managing emergency situations. Back table assistants are also responsible for monitoring vitals, which you'll notice is how they noticed the blood pressure spike prior to CA.  ""Crash carts"" are a must for any dental office, especially ones performing more invasive surgeries--I doubt you'll find a modern office without an AED. /u/AddyPose, I hope that is a sufficient response in addition to above.   As to why oral surgeons both give anesthesia and perform the procedure, I suspect it is a combination of saving money and overconfidence.    You have every right to look for an oral surgeon that will ask an anaesthesiologist to be present for your surgery. Surprisingly, the oral surgeon is trying to save YOU money. Since it's well within his scope of practice (read: expertise) to induce anaesthesia and perform his surgeries, you'd be responsible for the anaesthesiologist's time and expertise (4+4 years of training). Hint, even if you went to a hospital, you'd still be paying for the anaesthesiologist.   Since an oral surgeon is a specialist, he's also done at least 4+4 to 4+6 years of training. Given that it's their bread and butter case, you can be assured that even a green oral surgeon will have done over 100 cases of third molar with sedation by the time you walk into his office. Oral surgeons may be arrogant sons-of-bitches sometimes, but I'd hardly call them overconfident with respect to wisdom teeth.   Finally, your comment on regulation of outpatient procedures further infuriates me. Have you even bothered to look up the steps and processes behind licensure? An examiner is there. Watching you. Perform the surgery. While managing sedation.  Tl;dr stop talking out of your ass"
TwinCities,3a1c2c,yugenol,2,Wed Jun 17 04:07:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed answer.  But to clarify, are you equating a crash cart to an AED? It seems like you are in your response."

TwinCities,3a1c2c,yugenol,3,Wed Jun 17 10:28:42 2015 UTC,"I think my biggest concern has always been that despite all the training, if you don't do it enough, there's a big risk for hesitation in the face of something you don't see a lot of. Despite almost every nurse in a hospital having ACLS training, there is a reason they have code teams."
TwinCities,3a1c2c,perrla,0,Thu Jun 18 01:31:54 2015 UTC,"Very true. One of the steps in even basic CPR in the event of emergency, or even suspected emergency, is to call 911. ACLS certification doesn't make you a god, but it gives you the skillset to manage the emergency or stabilise the condition sufficiently until more specialised care can be delivered."
TwinCities,3a1c2c,yugenol,-2,Thu Jun 18 20:59:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed reply. I still did not care for the flippant way my surgeon addressed my questions before and after the procedure, which I think increased my feelings of mistrust in the process."
TwinCities,3a1c2c,AddyPose,-3,Wed Jun 17 04:15:28 2015 UTC,"I would never call an oral surgeon overconfident with regard to wisdom teeth. But that impression may be created with regard to their confidence with sedation/anesthesia.   Listen, I greatly respect OMFS training. You're the most highly skilled dentists out there. But I do think it's reasonable to question anesthesia qualifications. How many months, on average, do OMFS residents receive of dedicated anesthesia training?  Also, yes I am aware that crash carts are always present in these situations. Generally, though, that doesn't mean they're adequately stocked. I've been made aware of outpatient procedures where certain medications were not stocked (high expense, short shelf-life, lower probability of need for use). It's stuff like this I had in mind with my regulation comment. And like I said, I think having one person who is responsible for anesthesia and for performing a surgery/procedure can likely be problematic."
TwinCities,3a1c2c,anonanes,6,Wed Jun 17 05:20:12 2015 UTC,"Oral surgery residency now has 5 months of anesthesia training required, 1 of which is pediatric. You are held to the same standard as an anesthesiology resident at that time, it's not watered down."

Held to the same standard as an anesthesiology resident at what level of training, though? The first six months of their residency? The second six months? The third? The fourth? The fifth? The sixth?  There is much more hand-holding in the first year of clinical anesthesia residency than in any other period, by far, especially the first six months. That's why I find this statement imprecise/unclear."

TwinCities,3a1c2c,adthe1,2,Thu Jun 18 02:59:21 2015 UTC,"You flatter me, but I'm not an oral surgeon. I'll try to respond to all of your statements in this post.  At least 3 months of dedicated training in IV delivered drugs. It's nowhere near what an anaesthesiologist's training is, but think about their jobs. An anaesthesiologist is dedicated to inducing and, as you rightly said, maintaining anaesthesia -- often their surgeries can last hours upon hours. If an OMFS is taking more than an hour for 4 wisdom teeth (under light sedation), something's not right. In general, most oral surgeries are FAR much less traumatic than the cases that anaesthesiologists involved with. Less trauma = less epinepherine released into the blood (and other messy factors).  When more invasive surgeries are called for (with deeper levels of sedation), for say orthognathic or oncology surgeries, you'll find them working in a hospital with an anaesthesiologist. Dentists in general are conservative and very responsible about the cases they take on and where to do them. Certain cases belong in certain environments.  I understand your concerns. It's good to question. But what I don't appreciate is the fact that you'd pose all these open-ended, and rather inflammatory, questions rather than conducting your own research on general anaesthesia. And for what? To damage the trust that the public has in their healthcare professionals? You have questions regarding regulation? Look up your local dental board. Not sure on certifications? AAOMS is a good place to start. If you have serious concerns over regulation, please take them up with the board. They'll be more polite than me, but they also expect far more substantial research than blanket statements.  I won't question your qualifications, but one of the reasons the Board of Dentistry exists is to protect the public. If you look at most boards, there are members of the public sitting on them. As a practitioner, the board is generally more your friend than mine."

It's clear that the dental brigade is going to downvote to hell whatever I post, as they already have, so I'm going to stop engaging in this thread. I agree that conscious sedation in healthy patients is much less risky than your average GA surgery, though I think my concerns are legitimate and they are shared by many in the anesthesia community. I understand why the dental profession finds these concerns threatening. I'd like to point out, for the benefit of anyone reading, that nowhere in your long-winded post did you address anything in my OP that was ""factually inaccurate,"" as you wrote. Differences in opinion, yes."
TwinCities,3a1c2c,anonanes,2,Thu Jun 18 02:40:12 2015 UTC,"Sigh... Let's not play the victim here. No one set the ""dental downvote brigade"" on you -- voting is done based on what voters sympathise, support, or agree with. Nobody is trying to censor you, otherwise there wouldn't be so many dentists here providing thought-out responses. Calling us territorial and money-hungry? Well... we all have massive student loans to pay off, but that's rather hurtful.   Perhaps I'll take back the ""factually"", but after reading and hopefully comprehending my long-winded post(s), can you not see how your original post is inaccurate in its portrayal of reality? I know I'm long-winded. I want to provide people with the information they need to make accurate judgements. It's what dentists do -- we educate our patients. It's good to ask questions. I know you mean well, which is why I will continue to take the time to respond to you.  Please keep reading.  I made a misstep. I said ""inflammatory questions"", but your original post (that I was referring to) doesn't have any questions. My bad.  Your inflammatory statements, however, call into question professional qualifications that I'm not quite sure you fully understand. Dentistry is a stringently regulated profession and rightly so. You have no idea how many regulatory bodies are actually present. You've got the Council on Dental Accreditation, a subsection of the U.S. Department of Education, which basically gives dental schools and hospitals a license to educate dentists- and specialists-to-be. The American Dental Association publishes clinical guidelines and recommendations. You've got your local board of dentistry that will grill you if you aren't up to code. You've got specialty associations that also publish guidelines. Your office is inspected by umpteen various inspectors, from radiation physicists, to OSHA, to inspectors who come SOLELY to look at your sedation set-ups. All of these just to name a few. Our regulatory bodies are thorough. Annoyingly so. Do you know what it does to have an unannounced inspector show up and ruin the flow of your busy day?  But all of that is important. It's important that there are standards. It's important that we're qualified. The public places a lot of trust in us. And so, the professionnal bodies are heavily invested in ensuring that its members are only doing things that the big-wigs (experts, professional societies, public, etc) have said that we can do under our scope of practice. There's a difference between wondering what the regulation process is of a certain scenario vs. claiming that said scenario is unregulated and harmful which hurts our feelings.   Remember kids, do no harm. we said it too, okay  Part of the issue will be access to care. Wisdom tooth removal is super common and most people find it trivial or a right-of-passage (""I'm going to get my wisdom teeth out"", ""ok cool"") compared to other surgeries (""they're doing WHAT to your [insert organ here]?""). But unchecked and untreated wisdom teeth can be sons of bitches. I've seen them cause cavities on other teeth in a mouth that's never had decay before. I've seen, and referred out, pathologic jaw fracture from cystic development as a result of 20 years of not having the wisdom tooth removed (not to scare people -- it's uncommon). Partially erupted ones can cause facial swelling from pericoronitis and the result is life-threatening if the infection leaves the fascial space and enters certain other ones. So a lot of people need them out. And we'll recommend the others -- those we recognise to be potentially-problematic -- to be removed before they get to that point. Where am I going with this? Well, most people who aren't in immediate pain/danger don't want to be awake for some of the procedures (the drilling, the screaming, the pops and crunches and whatnot). In fact, any sort of fear or anxiety in a conscious patient makes the procedure far worse: epinephrine is released, heart rate and BP spike, patients become uncooperative and affect the surgical outcomes. Mandating that an anaesthesiologist is present at these surgeries severely impacts access to care. How many rural towns have anaesthesiologists vs dentists? How many people already avoid dental care due to the cost of the procedure? Is adding another expensive specialist going to help that? If oral surgeons are considered competent on their own, why burden the system further? Healthcare is broken enough as it is.  Finally, some reading for those interested:   Minnesota Administrative Rules regarding dentists and the use of sedation. ADA Guidelines for use of sedation and general anaesthesia by dentists. Page 5 for educational requirements, page 6 for clinical guidelines, page 14 for more reading material. American Society of Anesthesiologist's Practice Guidelines for Sedation and Analgesia by Non-Anesthesiologists.Even the anesthesiologists think it's okay for non- to perform anaesthesia!"

If it is well within a OMFS's expertise to manage all complications that can arise, why is anesthesiology residency 3 years on top of internship? It's an absurd question, obviously, but this where the impression of overconfidence comes from. You cite ACLS certification as proof of ability to manage an unexpected complication, but I would disagree with that. RN's can become ACLS certified in 2 days. Does that make them also able to best manage unexpected complications? (No, it doesn't, but it sure helps.) What I think your post largely ignores is that there are degrees of competency; it isn't black and white."
TwinCities,3a1c2c,anonanes,4,Wed Jun 17 05:34:23 2015 UTC,What your post ignores is the levels of sedation.  Conscious sedation is much more safe than general anesthesia.  You won't find an oral surgeon that puts your completely under without an anesthesiologist.  I work with 4th year residents routinely and they don't put anyone under without the anesthesiologist there and out in practice you won't see them do it outside an OR where an anesthesiologist is present.

But as you know, complications can and do arise with conscious sedation. How comfortable do oral surgeons feel intubating/maintaining a difficult airway when necessary? How adept is your average one when this is a needed intervention? When difficult complications arise, I think it's reasonable to think about how a dedicated anesthesia professional would address these (medically, procedurally) versus your average oral surgeon."

TwinCities,3a1c2c,yugenol,2,Wed Jun 17 18:58:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's a big conspiracy to stomp on the little guy. The fact is that these procedures require little anesthesia maintenance as they are sedation using Xanax (not exactly but same family). These drugs have a VERY wide safe range and are great for minimally invasive procedures. They won't work for larger surgical procedures as the surgery becomes too much stress on the body and the body will override the drugs.  The way that these procedures work is the doctor gives a basic dose, calculates the patient's metabolic rate of the drug and then maintains a minimal amount of the drug in the system to keep them asleep.   At no point during the procedure do they lose unconscious control of their basic functions.   The first thing we do when working on a patient that is compromised is protect the airway.  Most likely, she had a rare adverse reaction to the anesthetic and sedative. Even that is me talking out of my ass as I wasn't there.  Oral surgeons have competed a four year residency at a hospital and many an additional two getting their M.D.. They know what they're doing.   Anesthesiologists do much much more than this type of procedure. They are who keeps a GSW patient alive while the surgeon hunts for a leaky artery. They are trained not just to bring down and up but maintain a deep, surgical sedation safely which is much much different than giving an IV of benzodiazepine.   The metaphorical equivalent I can think of for this is using a plastic surgeon to do a punch biopsy. Yes, he's the best for the job, but the gp is more than qualified to do it."
TwinCities,3a1c2c,TheGogglesD0Nothing,2,Thu Jun 18 23:40:21 2015 UTC,"You give more than IV benzos, don't you? What about opioids? Or does local obviate the need?  As I said, I agree an anesthesiologist is overkill. A nurse anesthetist would be great for this, but at the very least I would want this performed in a facility where there is a code team available who has experience addressing airway and other emergency issues on regular basis.   At no point during the procedure do they lose unconscious control of their basic functions.   Yes, this is the goal. But it's not guaranteed. Every year, people lose consciousness in dental offices unexpectedly during procedural sedation and I question how well these emergencies are managed."
TwinCities,3a1c2c,anonanes,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:05:40 2015 UTC,"No. That's it. IV benzodiazepine and local anesthetic. There's no need for more. If you're certified in that, you must maintain a full crash cart, like the ones in a hospital. If someone has an episode in the chair, the oral surgeon has an assistant call an ambulance, while the surgeon stabilizes. They're fully trained on how to handle a code. The same goes for any dentist doing an IV case. They are trained in what drugs to give. No they're aren't a trauma unit, but they are at or above the level of paramedic.   The only other drugs given IV may be IV ibuprofen to keep swelling down and flumazenil to reverse any leftover benzo. Like I said, it's a very safe procedure."

It's my opinion that more regulation is needed for outpatient surgeries/anesthetized procedures, particularly regarding oral surgery and gastroenterological procedures (colonoscopies, etc)."
TwinCities,3a1c2c,anonanes,-4,Tue Jun 16 20:14:25 2015 UTC,"This is one of the biggest reasons I haven't had my wisdom teeth pulled.

TwinCities,3a1c2c,perrla,5,Wed Jun 17 01:50:18 2015 UTC,"To be able to sedate is a very lengthy process and yes they do have the training and expertise to do this. It is a certification and maintained by the state that the practice is in. Every single dental office has a full emergency kit including AED, oxygen, ambubag, and so on.  It is a major violation to not have one and it has a log that is maintained DAILY.  All personnel that will be on the clinic floor must be BLS certified at a minimum.  If any kind of conscious or deep sedation is to be done then they have to be ACLS certified.  To get the training is a several month process at a dental shool or as part of a specialty training residency.  I don't understand  why the public thinks that we just decide to do something without any training. If you want to know a practitioners qualifications for something like this just ask.  Every aspect of practice is governed by licensure and certifications that have to be maintained yearly.  If you go to an office that does sedation I promise you they have the training to safely get you through the procedure."

I totally get that these doctors are probably ACLS certified and staff working with them are at least BLS certified. My concern comes in that they are doing a procedure/surgery where complications (especially arrests) are rare. This is where the problem potentially comes into play. I read a story several years ago where an oral surgeon was working on a young kid who arrested and instead of calling 911 and starting CPR they ran next door to the pediatricians office for help. People sometimes panic in the face of things that don't crop up a lot. This is why hospitals have code teams, they have a team of expert nurses, RTs, pharmacists, and MDs who do this a lot and can go into an autopilot mode.   Would I be knocked out in a dentists office if it were necessary? Totally. After asking A LOT of questions."

TwinCities,3a1c2c,anonanes,2,Thu Jun 18 05:10:07 2015 UTC,"Basically re-stating that frequently being in specific situations helps your comfort level and ability to function in those situations. I was using my primary MD as an example.   Sorry super sleepy, but waiting for my kid to knock out before even attempting bed."
TwinCities,3a1c2c,perrla,2,Thu Jun 18 05:22:39 2015 UTC,"No worries, I feel similarly. Codes take practice. I don't feel it's something dentists get a lot of exposure to.  If an anesthesiologist/CRNA is not present for conscious sedation, I feel it would be better for these procedures to be done in a facility where a code team can be called quickly. To me that seems reasonable. This is the case in hospitals where patients may get sedation while undergoing imaging, as one example."
TwinCities,3a1c2c,anonanes,3,Thu Jun 18 05:33:25 2015 UTC,"Oral surgeons have 4 years of dental school and many years (up to 6 additional years) of residency afterwards to learn what to do in these situations. (That's 10 years!!) There is a risk for ANYONE going under ANY anesthesia, but the possibility of this happening is so, so rare. Your doctor is very skilled and very very trained in their job. They know what to do if something goes wrong - it's one of the biggest parts of their job. You are truly uneducated. If something were to go wrong with the patient that was truly from the doctor's negligence, their license would be revoked and there would be all sorts of malpractice suits against them. Things happen that no one can control. But every doctor has had the training to know what to do."
TwinCities,3a1c2c,mplusg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:53:13 2015 UTC,"It's not about negligence or even not knowing what to do, it's about reaction time and potential chaos. If a clinic only has one case a year they are calling medics on they might not have a strong well practiced system into place. When people don't go through this stuff a lot, they hesitate and sometimes question themselves."

TwinCities,3a1c2c,mplusg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:56:28 2015 UTC,... oral surgeons routinely give their own anesthesia and simultaneously perform whatever procedure is being done. This is practically unheard of for any other type of provider; virtually all other surgeries are performed with a dedicated anesthesia provider such as an anesthesiologist or a nurse anesthetist.   How do you think millions of endoscopy procedures are performed every year? How do you think they reset shoulders or other bones in ERs or place sutures on a scared to death child? We're far from the only provider doing these sorts of things.
TwinCities,3a1c2c,LilLessWise,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:09:30 2015 UTC,"As I wrote, I think gastroenterology offices similarly have questionable practices. Resetting dislocated shoulders or placing sutures in a hospital setting seem much more safe to me; these are very minor procedures performed by physicians with a multitude of experience in resuscitation and in a setting where there is a code team readily available."
TwinCities,3a1c2c,anonanes,2,Thu Jun 18 15:39:49 2015 UTC,"If it's in a hospital setting, these procedures can and are done in minor emergency care facilities by family physicians as well. You do have a point regarding code teams.  Regardless, how do you contend to deal with the infrastructure and staffing shortages if one were to mandate all minor oral surgery and endoscopy procedures be done with anesthesiologists or in a hospital setting? If not, what is your suggestions to address the third molar removal and other outpatient conscious sedation procedures. The track record for OMFS is pretty amazing, and there are always tragedies in the medical field. It is unfortunate that for wisdom teeth or pediatrics are often highly publicized creating a skewed view in the public."
TwinCities,3a1c2c,LilLessWise,2,Thu Jun 18 16:07:55 2015 UTC,You're right that infrastructure would be the biggest issue. Personally I would always want at least a nurse anesthetist on site if I were the patient. An anesthesiologist's expertise is probably overkill in these settings.
TwinCities,3a1c2c,anonanes,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:41:10 2015 UTC,Nurse anesthetist don't exist where I am so I am unfamiliar with their training. Is it significantly more than the OMFS residency?

Putting aside the very real possibility of layoffs (I can only hope that employees of Target Pharmacies will be offered jobs at CVS in the hopes of an expedient transition) but CVS has rubbed me the wrong way recently.   They were one of the few companies to go out of their way to prohibit customers from using Apple Pay by disabling contactless card readers to physically prevent you from trying, in favor of the payment service CurrentC, which has fewer privacy controls than either Apple Pay or Google Wallet, which lets merchants go digging around into your data without any way for you to opt out.  It felt to me, and a large portion of the tech enthusiast community here on Reddit, like an incredibly anti-consumer move as CurrentC would have offered merchants more access to our records beyond what they already have, and the disabling of the use of competing services felt disturbingly anti-competitive as it prevents consumers from voting with their dollars.

TwinCities,39xplx,lettuce,3,Mon Jun 15 17:56:17 2015 UTC,"For me, I'd think it's an issue of community and involvement.  If we split the subreddits for the City and metro area, we end up with two much-smaller subreddits, and a resulting weaker reddit community in each sub.  Look at metro areas by population, and starting smaller than MSP.  Combo city/metro area subreddits gain a lot of members:   San Diego, /r/sandiego 24,477 members St. Louis, /r/stlouis 15,329 members Baltimore, /r/baltimore 16,341 members   Conversely, metro areas that try to split the main city from the metro-area subreddit have much smaller membership.  (You could look at /r/miami and it's variants as well) Splitting up Minneapolis and the twin cities results in two subreddits with smaller memberships:   Minneapolis, /r/minneapolis 10,894 members Twin Cities, /r/twincities 10,774 members   Why not try to combine these subs?

I WOULD come in if there were a reason to: say a really comfortable place to sit and read, maybe get a latte, OR if there was access to journals through the library that made it worth it. I do go to Dunn Bros to read and sit outside a great deal in the summer.    Basically, the local libraries fail with respect to non-fiction, and their deployment of kindle lending makes walking in the door unnecessary for fiction. They don't provide any service or comforts in the building worth showing up for.  Your second survey question is rough to answer. I get kindle books on a weekly basis.

I am hoping to go into archives (digital and physical) in something like a museum collection, or perhaps an academic library (I've got a background in biological research). In my incoming class, the people fell into several tracks which they wanted to specialize in: archives/preservation, school libraries, special libraries (medical/corporate/law), academic libraries, and digital collections. None of us actually wants to go into public library work for our first choice, and I think that's a distinct sign of a changing profession.  Right now, libraries are really transitioning into a gathering space for communities. For example, at Hennepin County Library you can go to classes about beekeeping, or go to a meeting to converse with people in Russian, or any myriad of random events hosted by the libraries and various groups. Many libraries across the country are beginning to develop maker spaces.  I absolutely foresee libraries lending hard copies of books 20 years from now, especially for pleasure reading.

TwinCities,39t5ug,jabonko,3,Sun Jun 14 19:37:41 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, but with a disclaimer that it depends a liiittle on what you want to do. I've found the program to be really comprehensive, close-knit, and with a great support system. With that said, get ready for a wall of text!  Your top priority should be to attend a school that's ALA accredited (which St Kate's is, but not all library schools are!). Based on what I've learned from the library directors I've worked for, most libraries only care that a place is ALA accredited and they don't really care much about which specific school you went to, with a few exceptions (more on that later). You will get a good education at any accredited school. If you're in the twin cities and you don't want to relocate, absolutely go to St Kates! UWisc has a great online program too, though you can't specialize in everything unless you go on campus.  Re the exception I mentioned earlier: there are some schools (San Jose State and this one school in Texas that I'm blanking on) that are online only and absolutely pump out the graduates. I'd recommend against one of those programs.  The above holds true for almost all library/archive jobs (public libraries, school libraries, medical/law/other special libraries, etc). That said, if you want to be a research librarian/professor or a subject librarian at an R1 academic institution you will probably want to choose a program like the University of Michigan, which specializes in that sort of thing—plus you'll want a lot of background in your subject area as well. Some places require two masters degrees (the MLIS, and the masters in whatever subject you're specializing in)."

TwinCities,39t5ug,mitchx3,2,Tue Jun 16 03:12:05 2015 UTC,"I recently started using the TC library system more. Their web presence sucks. I've used Anoka, Ramsey, and Hennepin's sites, as well as the interlibrary loan system. The websites are poorly laid out, and the search functions are bad. They all need an overhaul. Other than that, the libraries themselves are decent. Some are tiny(New Brighton or Fridley). Others decent sized. The ability to basically order a book to my local library from my computer is the greatest thing keeping me using the library."

I think the goal was to have less stuff available at one time to minimize the craziness.  Anyways, definitely know what you want, and keep your eyes open for stuff that's not back in the garage sale room.  I stumbled across a cartop carrier that had only cosmetic issues and ended up costing about 40% of original price.

This is correct, the Bloomington store does have a constantly rotating ""Attic"" area above the Rental area.

TwinCities,39o1xm,0-1-1-2-3-5-8-13-21,7,Sat Jun 13 03:35:01 2015 UTC,"Depending on her agility, my favorite walk begins at Sea Salt, down the stairs to the bottom of the falls, and winding out to the end that comes to a point at the Mississippi. It's about 90% good trail and about 10% where things can be slightly harder to maneuver. It's all fairly flat though, and besides the stairs, is quite lovely. It'd probably fall short of a 2 hour hike, but there are some nice places to sit along the way."
TwinCities,39o1xm,Republicofjohn,2,Sat Jun 13 06:27:58 2015 UTC,"If you find yourself struggling to extend the walk to two hours, consider following the road/trail around the western edge of the park and entering the off-leash dog park! It's less manicured than the park itself, but well-maintained and one of my favorite wandering spaces. I've easily spent hours walking around on and off the main trails with little difficulty. Free to enter and comes with happy-puppy viewing!"
TwinCities,39o1xm,strangewine,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:32:39 2015 UTC,You can also extend your trip by taking the trail north on River Road for as far as you like.
TwinCities,39o1xm,rigtenzin,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:09:10 2015 UTC,"When you go down past the falls following the creek towards the river, there's a split in the path. There is a gravel path on the left, and a muddy boardwalk hiking trail on the right. The two sides connect with several bridges across the creek, and with one final bridge down at the the beach where the creek meets the river. 60 minute route down and back.  To the left of the start of the gravel trail is a path that leads up to the wabun park area. There are pavilians, a disc golf course, a playground, grills, families, and connective footpaths. Hilly. The time to aimlessly walk around should be about 15 minutes. The time to walk up and out of the glen and around back to sea salt would be about 20 minutes.   To the right of the muddy boardwalk hiking trail are several staircases that lead up to grassy fields and foot paths that follow the wooded edge of normal land above the creek valley. Those paths continue riverwise towards a veterans memorial or something and Fort Snelling. Indefinite time can be used thataway, or walking back around the top of the falls to sea salt should take about 20-30 minutes from near the beach.   Additional pedestrian paths are the cedar lake trail, which you'll see if you walk from sea salt towards the ice cream vendor across the road, and the West River Parkway trail which follows the river up towards the UofM and beyond."

TwinCities,39i7cd,antonymous,3,Fri Jun 12 04:41:18 2015 UTC,"You aren't going to save money over hydro though. In this part of the country from April to July the price for hydro power is often negative (Chicago will buy some of it for more than it costs to operate dams). Solar is nice and all, but I think a lot of people assume that because sunlight is free solar power is cheap, when in reality it very rarely can be installed and maintained for less than your current price of electricity.  And frankly for Cologne wind energy would make a lot more sense if you wanted to go completely renewable. Minnesota is not exactly a great place for solar, as during the winter insolation on a sunny day drops below 3 kw/hr per meter squared, whereas in the summer it's up over 11 kw/hr per meter squared. A 75% reduction in output just because of the seasons is a little wasteful. Wind as you go west in Minnesota is going to be a lot more consistent and reliable."
TwinCities,39i7cd,vahntitrio,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:40:46 2015 UTC,"Cologne is surrounded by hills that are not part of it. Plus, Cologne doesn't have enough city-owned land to build its own wind farm without replacing most of its park space. They do enough surface area on their municipal buildings to place solar panels on the roofs, though. Solar is more viable with regards to space and finance constraints. They'd have to annex enough land, purchase that land, and then build the windmills to have enough windmills for it to produce enough energy to power their municipal buildings."

Also they are very flexible with their billing, so changing membership levels is easy, no contract, and if you are out of town for a week or whatever length of time, you can very easily suspend your membership as needed.

TwinCities,39bqec,automator3000,3,Wed Jun 10 19:52:10 2015 UTC,"Competition is healthy, but the overall dream in this project would provide a meeting space for all types of game players and designers, rather than just table top.  The focus on Magic might not actually be the way it plays out, it's just the way I initially envisioned it.  That's why I am planning on holding public forums to see what the community wants the most."
TwinCities,39bqec,bamskamp,4,Wed Jun 10 22:52:01 2015 UTC,"Go for it!  I'd come!  What I'm discovering about the TC gaming scene is that each existing gaming store/venue tends to support a slightly different community - predominantly based on geography, but spilling over to sub-genre emphasis (e.g., MtG, LCG, miniatures, euros, wargaming).  I think most FLGSs are trying to support as many as they can, which makes geography the bigger determinant, but when stores are closer together, they tend to support gamers from different sub-groups in order to distinguish themselves.    Making your venue MtG-focused might immediately attract the largest proportion of the gaming community (compared to any other single game), it might pigeonhole the venue to the detriment of other segments of the community you'd eventually like to support.  For example, I don't think game designers would have a lot of interest in showing up to test games at a place known primarily for 'grown-up' Friday Night Magic.  I'm not claiming that they're mutually exclusive crowds, but I could envision the need to hold non-overlapping events two capture both groups. Disclosure: I don't play magic, but always wish I could sip a brew while playing at my favorite FLGS.  Others might be able to chime in, but I can only think of one other FLGS that serves food and drinks (i.e., the FFGC in Roseville), so if the idea is to support diverse games, I think there would be a positive response.  On the flip side, there are some gamers within the local craft brew scene, and while it may not be not uncommon to find folks playing games at a bar/brewery anymore, the degree to which they offer gaming events is less than what I think you're shooting for:  https://www.facebook.com/events/656015564521635  https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1295592/waconia-mn-west-twin-cities-brewery-boardgame-meet  Finally - might be worthwhile pursuing jointly sponsored events with established gaming groups (e.g., UGG, 1st MN) if you could entice them out of the spaces they already call 'home.'  Good luck!"
TwinCities,39bqec,Dawnbreaka,3,Wed Jun 10 21:01:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the input and the links.  As for pigeonholing the community, it is definitely something on my radar and something I want to avoid.  That's why I plan on holding public forums to really find what will work best in a space like this.  I really want to make sure the Magic community is supported, but I also want to make sure everyone else feels comfortable there :)"
TwinCities,39bqec,bobpuller,5,Wed Jun 10 22:54:47 2015 UTC,I've always thought a gaming/nerd culture inspired venue would do well if it was executed properly. Good luck!

TwinCities,39bqec,meatwhisper,2,Thu Jun 11 13:05:47 2015 UTC,"Hey Emo, I posted a few times on the MTG thread you made and put a little thought into it since then.  Why not focus on the video game aspect, something like Barcade or a less sleazy Insert Coins?  There is also a huge pinball scene here in town that would be all over something like that.  Then you could have a side space for table top games and other events, including MTG.  Focus on something that this city doesn't have yet, THEN add the stuff that we do to give people extra incentive.    https://barcade.com/  EDIT - Also... http://www.reddit.com/r/twincitiessocial/comments/39cqez/barcraft_june_28th/"
TwinCities,39bqec,meatwhisper,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:56:23 2015 UTC,"Definitely thought about that aspect as well.  I used to run video game tournaments in bars in Burlington, VT.  We are hosting a large Smash Brothers Tournament here at Republic next Saturday the 20th as well.  Like I said before, I want it to welcome all gamers, and the original vision had a focus on Magic but I was reaching out to see what would make the space work the best.  This may be the focus in the end, who knows.  As long as the space is welcoming to everyone in the end, I'll be happy."
TwinCities,39bqec,stpauler,2,Thu Jun 11 14:47:57 2015 UTC,"Great to know about the Smash Brothers tournament.  I think that is a step in the right direction.  For the University area, doing Esports and stuff like Smash Brothers would be freaking HUGE.  There is no place in town that does this (that I know of) and is a very popular niche that is untapped.    Having a side space for table top gaming, Magic, and nerd pub trivia/karaoke seems like the smart thing to do, but to focus JUST Magic is a mistake for this deep resource of customers you have sitting there a mile away.  Think ""Buffalo Wild Wings for nerds"" rather than ""Another Game Store but beer.""  Magic players can stay home and drink beer when they play.  Give them a reason to come and WANT to drink beer with YOU."
TwinCities,39bqec,automator3000,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:01:37 2015 UTC,"I never planned on Magic being the only focus.  You can focus on something but still be great at a lot of other things.  I just want to make sure that community is supported because it is so large here.  The esports will be a huge part of the space as well, and may end up being the bigger focus, and that is totally ok, and quite possibly the right move.    As long as everyone is supported, the beer is good and affordable, and it sets a precedence to be the best it can be, the space will do well.  There will be a lot of events to test the waters, of all types of games.  I think this process will be a lot of fun not only for me, but the community as a whole :)  Thanks so much for all the input, I really appreciate it.  This has been my dream ever since I started running game nights in bars years ago, and it's looking like I'm finally in the right town to make it happen."
TwinCities,39bqec,automator3000,2,Thu Jun 11 16:07:05 2015 UTC,"Okay, well most posts I've seen you mainly just talk about the Magic and rarely about the other things.    I wish you luck and hope you find success!"

It's easy to get excited about one end of a project when there a lots of others really excited about it!  Thanks again!"
TwinCities,39bqec,rkoloeg,2,Thu Jun 11 16:38:24 2015 UTC,"Sounds interesting, here's what I know. A couple years ago I got really into boardgaming. I visited every single boardgame shop in the Twin Cities metro area, I spent a lot of time on boardgamegeek, and a lot of money buying games. I've settled down a bit since then, I have a regular Tuesday night gaming group at my house and that's about it right now. So that said, here goes:  1)M:tG is the money maker for the friendly local gaming store (FLGS). This is where a lot of the stores break even or make money. Wizards of the Coast have set this up well so that people keep buying new cards as opposed to playing with what they already have.  2) On the other hand, the rest of the board game community tends to shun the M:tG folks. Yes, there's snobbery involved. It's there, so just be aware of it. 3) Fantasy Flight Event Center is the only place currently selling beer and wine. 4) Village Games in Anoka is the only store that lets customers consign their games for sale.  5) None of the local FLGS have prices below 10% off of MSRP.  6) If you want this to be a bar, you could be knocking out a large demographic of under 21 patrons. 7) Lighting is essential for gaming. Usually this is the antithesis of bar lighting.  8) Location and free parking are important. I've never been to the Republic at 7 Corners, but the idea of finding parking there could be daunting. If not free parking, maybe validated if you spent $25 or something.  9) Ceiling height is important for...umm...smell. Go to a game night at FFEC and then go to one at The Source. The ceiling helps.  10) There are currently no game stores on the light rail lines (except Games by James at the MOA). 11) You know what I'd love to see? League nights that don't involve M:TG/Wizards of the Coast. The idea would be that customers would set up teams and compete against other teams on a weekly basis. Each week it'd be a different and new game that you also sell. Winning team gets a trophy. This insures repeat customers and board game sales.  12) Have a knowledgeable and FRIENDLY staff that can sell your products. (Some stores you can tell the employees work more for the discount than anything). 13) Realize that you won't have time to play M:TG anymore. I've heard this from FLGS owners over and over that they no longer are interested in the hobby anymore."

With the amount of people involved it's terrible. There is also some bridge work on 55 or something like that which is on the way to 35e south bound one of the detours for cedar.  Oh and for some fucking reason no one knows how to use the full lanes so we get off ramps and lanes backed up for miles for no reason
TwinCities,398zgt,leetercola,17,Wed Jun 10 03:21:21 2015 UTC,The construction on hwy 100 is absolutely killing the West Metro. 169 always sucks and now it's seeing double the traffic which is contributing to everything on that side of town. The work on 55 and and tunnel behind the airport is hurting 62 and everything else. Snelling being closed on 94 is causing a hell of a problem. There is just a ton of stuff going on everywhere and it is making traffic brutal everywhere.
TwinCities,398zgt,ISISFieldAgent,10,Wed Jun 10 08:23:15 2015 UTC,"The idiot at MNDOT who decided to put both 100 and 494 under construction at the same time should be forced to move to the west metro for the summer so he can share the 2 hour commutes.   There are 3 major North-South routes in the West Metro: 494, 169 and 100.  494 and 100 are completely fucked up with construction. 169 is two lanes most of the time.

TwinCities,395hei,FFFrank,12,Tue Jun 9 15:27:31 2015 UTC,"The reason it's garbage is that they are using a loophole in the FCC regulations to provide this signal.  This station is actually a ""translator"" for KTCZ-HD3 (Cities 97 subchannel 3).  Traditionally ""translator"" stations are low-power stations used to fill in gaps in coverage areas for full-power stations.  Since digital ""HD"" radio failed to take off the FCC is allowing stations with HD subchannels to provide ""translator"" stations to rebroadcast the HD subchannel in analog so more people can receive it (even though they could receive it just fine on the ""main"" station if they had an HD radio). Translator stations also don't count for ownership limits.  However, to qualify as a translator station they have to adhere to a strict power limit of 250 watts vs the 100,000 watt limit for normal stations."

TwinCities,395hei,coll0412,6,Tue Jun 9 18:35:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the key is that translators must retransmit a signal from a full-power station and the FCC allowed the loophole that you can use a digital subchannel of a full-power station as your source.  The FCC's reason for doing this is to help stations recoup the cost of installing digital broadcasting equipment since almost nobody bought digital receivers."

It'd be much safer to climb a sheer rock cliff by the river because those aren't in much danger of parts falling off of them.  The reason these grain elevators have holes in the floor is that they're structurally deficient.  They haven't really been maintained as structures in years, so they're slowly falling down piece by piece.  Each winter makes more cracks and more chips of concrete.  Sooner or later they'll reach the stage where parts start falling off on the outside, at which point someone (the city or owner) will pay to have them taken down by a demolition crew.  For right now, going up in them is just stupid.  There are harder and easier climbs with better views in the city, and if Urbex is your thing there are safer abandoned sites within a short drive.

That's what the market is willing to pay for an apartment in/near downtown St. Paul.   You have to get away from downtown if you want to pay less than $1000 for a one bedroom. The city should be encouraging more apartment projects along the Green Line. There are already a few going up, and the rates are as low as $900 for a one bedroom.

TwinCities,38x0ak,Tuilere,7,Mon Jun 8 02:23:09 2015 UTC,"That's why you take out the mortgage long before you retire. The payments don't rise with inflation and the equity is transferable if you want to purchase a different home or downsize for retirement.

TwinCities,38x0ak,MactheDog,4,Mon Jun 8 02:44:13 2015 UTC,"That's not realistic for many, though.   So, for instance, there was that one woman. Widow. Older. If she were living in a home she'd bought pre-retirement with spouse, she'd now be responsible for all maintenance. That can be hard. The furnace is 20 years old and goes out? Well, that's $3000 to pull out of her ass. A new school referendum? Taxes go up. Tree hits the roof? Insurance goes up.  There was a guy in St. Paul whose house burned down recently in the news. He was uninsured, because while the house was paid off, he couldn't afford insurance. I suspect his maintenance practices were also less than ideal.  Not to mention: Health issues come up, and the best move for many seniors is to sell the house, especially if it's a bi-level.  When I bought my first house, I bought a bi-level with basement from a pair of seniors who couldn't maintain it or do the stairs. Age is a bitch.  Owning isn't right for everyone, either financially, or physically, at any number of ages. It has a lot of expenses beyond the mortgage payment, and even a paid off home can be expensive."

Say half of a couple ends up with Alzheimer's. Medicare helps, but to get to Medicaid they'll have to run through a lot of the assets. The home is protected to some extent, but when the Medicaid kicks in, it and any fixed income payments is all the other partner will have left. For years. So even if he/she sells the home, the equity is the bulk of what they have to live with for the rest of his/her life, and selling it before the other partner dies fucks up Medicaid eligibility, so there's that little wrinkle too.)"

TwinCities,38x0ak,MactheDog,3,Mon Jun 8 12:52:55 2015 UTC,"Treating housing as an ""investment"" is dangerous, as anyone who has been refinancing under HAMP can tell you.  Home ownership as the ultimate goal of all people is a shell game sold over the last 50 years that is becoming less and less sustainable. People don't stay at companies 20+ years any more. The cost of buying or selling a home can be 10% of the home value, which means turning around to sell in 2-3 years' time is hazardous even for the young.   Meanwhile, we heavily subsidize it (hell-o tax breaks for mortgage interest) while underinvesting in other options, especially affordable housing options."

I also think ""but rent is a waste of money!"" can be a really dangerous myth, because you aren't guaranteed appreciation.

If you are a person with a job in the city, it would likely cost considerably less to pay more for an apartment than it would to pay for a house. You would also get something in better condition, and zero maintenance cost.

You have to look at existing successful transit infrastructure in the US and see what benefits it provides the community many decades after that infrastructure was built. Most importantly, well planned mass transit consistently raises land value over time.  In the end, the economics of transit boil down to a simple fact. A condo building on half an acre can generate $500,000 to $1,000,000 in tax income for a city. You would need 50 acres of land to generate the same tax revenue with single family homes on 1/4 acre lots.

Acceptance of LGBT folk is on the rise, so people who want to violently lash out, and used to target the LGBT community, are going to find a new target, one that society is less approving of.

Anyway, to me I think it's useful for a ""tolerant"" person to say ""yes, this is weird, but that's OK.""  There are ignorant people out there who respond to weird things with hate, derision, even violence.  A tolerant person can educate those people by saying ""hey, it's weird, but why do you care?""  I guess the problem that comes in is you have these social conservatives who point to shit like this as an indicator of what they see as the decline of civilization -- the decline of morality.  And then when you have tolerant people (social liberals) saying it's OK, then it becomes part of this political cause where the social conservatives say that the social liberals are bringing us down as a society.  Those politicians hope there's enough people out there who will be grossed out by furries and other ""weird"" things and hold that against liberal-minded people."

This kind of falls into the same realm of other ""childlike"" kinks like diaper wearing and dolly adult dress up for some folks.  I remember a MTV expose back in the 90's that brought furries to light in pop culture, and was focused on the sexhole pervert type and not the ""I identify with an animal"" types.  This meant that there was a whole generation of people who are quick to slap the ""pervert"" label on every furry/fursuit person they see no matter how liberal they see themselves.    Definitely does NOT defend threats of violence, but when you bring the suits out into public spaces there will be assumptions made by people who may not understand/want to understand the innocent roots to the behavior."

A furry is someone who enjoys anthromorpmoric animals like sonic the hedgehog and the Robin Hood from the animated disney version.  Fursuiters dress up like these characters.  As a group the fursuiter circle is much smaller than the furry circle.  As an analogy, it's like an article saying that these are anime fans and going on to talk about dressing up as anime characters as if that was the only way to enjoy anime. Anyone who enjoys anime knows that these are cosplayers, and enjoying anime does not in any way imply that you typically dress up as anime characters.   Here is a handy venn diagram for reference"

The word 'furry' has been co-opted to singularly describe these perfectly nice dudes who invest many thousands of dollars and lots of time and effort into a costume and then go put it on display. I don't do that. The vast majority of actual 'furries' don't ever do that.   Think about it this way; what if this was the only way football was ever shown by the media, people like him, all painted up, shirtless on a freezing day. They never show the game, they never show the players, they just show this dude screaming and smashing beer cans on his forehead. This is football!  How do you talk to your friends about football?

There's nothing really interesting to show the general public without the suits, because otherwise it's a bunch of people with an interest in anthro art. The people writing the comic books don't make the headline photo. The cosplayers do.   With football there's a culturally relevant game for people to focus on. The game is the draw.

How the hell hasn't an editor gone in there and cleaned it the formatting yet? Sentences ending with commas, sentences that are treated as paragraphs unto themselves, come on.  That being said, I'd like to know what is it about these stations that will save $200M. Is there some way they could just reduce the cost of each station instead of eliminating them?   ""We'll lose a lot of services to our transit-dependent population within Eden Prairie,"" [Eden Prairie Mayor Nancy Tyra-Lukens] said.   Eden Prairie has a transit-dependent population? The area doesn't have much for transit already. Aside from the weekly bus to Wal-mart I don't see how anyone could be transit-dependent in Eden Prairie, aside from commuters (who still need to go to a park-and-ride).   ""The hub and spoke model that we have now — where you go to downtown to go everywhere — gets to be a pain in the patoot, frankly,"" [Hennepin County Commissioner Linda Higgins] said.

Instead of the glorified bus-shelter-like/minimalist light rail stations we have now, think of having the train stations be a small retail center that housed an internal courtyard.  The courtyard would have tables and benches for people to wait for their train.  That courtyard would be surrounded by a handful of businesses: a dry cleaner, small convenience store, a coffee shop and/or fast-foot establishment.  Businesses could have external-facing storefronts for non-workday business as well.  Commuters would have an area to wait for the train, drop off dry-cleaning (or pick it up on the way home), pick up bread or a gallon of milk, or enjoy a morning coffee or sandwich.  A retail development would cost more initially, but I'd like to think rent would eventually pay down, pay off, and then provide a profit.  Something like that might even boost ridership.

Honestly though from the portfolio shows I've seen, maybe 10-15 percent had the skills to get hired at an agency, the rest would probably struggle.  The thing about creative industries like graphic design, its less about the skills and more about the talent. Especially for the mid to upper tier agencies. Your portfolio probably matters most. If you are struggling to find a job in the creative industry already with an art degree, i don't know if a graphic design is going to get you any closer.  You may want to consider picking up any freelance jobs you can get on the side, even if they pay crap to start. Put work into it, not so much for your client, but for yourself. Experiment with Indesign, Photoshop and Illustrator, and see how you can you can use your illustration background in a digital medium. Art is about creating what you want to create, graphic design is about creating what your client wants you to create. Good designers can often blend the two."

Also as parent post alluded to, not that many people who study art end up employed making art.

I don't feel like I have had the time or energy to pursue practicing enough since graduating, though I don't know if I would ever even make a living off of my art, so I don't feel like it is a priority in my life to practice to get better.  I have had a few freelance jobs since 2012, though only one has really involved much creativity unfortunately.  I put myself out there on Odesk and Elance back in the spring of 2014 when I was unemployed after finishing an assignment at a mortgage job, but haven't done anything like that since then (and I sort of stated the reason why in a previous sentence, about it not really being a priority).  I have been super unhappy at all of my non-art jobs since graduating sadly; I know many art graduates are in the same boat.  I am feeling like graphic design wouldn't be worth pursuing ultimately.

You are using the lane with short white stripes (which signify an ending lane) in order to bypass everyone else who has merged correctly? If that is what you are alluding to doing, you are indeed not breaking the rules, but are in fact a colossal douche.   And your second short cut creates more traffic build up behind you by creating more merging traffic. Rather than merge onto the correct 494 exit from Cedar, you are now creating more slowdown at your ""shortcut"" by having to merge in their.

TwinCities,38iwd2,megavega420,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:07:01 2015 UTC,"No, I am talking about the collector/distributor lane, no short white lines, completely separated from freeway.  394 has several of them.  And they are relatively uncrowded, which means you are not taking up space on the more crowded freeway during that stretch.  You are using underutilized capacity vs. overcrowded  space.  If that makes me a douche because I get to cut in front of a couple dozen cars so be it, but it creates a net benefit to the point where the C/D lane is overcrowded.  At which point there is no sense in using that tactic anyway. Your second example makes no sense, they end up merging at the same spot on 494 anyway, my route is a shorter line in the morning because it is mainly there for people leaving the Mall of America which few people do at 6:30.  In case you're confused, I take the right fork at ""killebrew/landau"" and simply don't exit on them which takes you to 494.  The direct ramp from 77 usually has a longer line.  If I were to save even more time and use the carpool ramp now that would be illegal and wrong.   You sound like one of those people who think the zipper merge is bad too?"
TwinCities,38iwd2,bobpuller,0,Fri Jun 5 16:03:17 2015 UTC,"Zipper merging at a low speed immediately as the solid line ends is bad.   How does removing yourself from the natural flow of traffic, only to have to re-merge in at a different spot not interrupting the flow of traffic? You are telling me that every single morning you merge back in perfectly and don't make that car behind you slow down in the slightest bit? Because that is how traffic jams start. One person merging in and causing someone to brake, and then it snowballs behind.   I know exactly where you are talking about from experience, because people like you cut me off daily."
TwinCities,38iwd2,megavega420,2,Fri Jun 5 16:56:23 2015 UTC,"I don't cut anybody off.  That time I am off the roadway lessens the pressure at the pinch points in the flow.  And again it's not ""people like me,""  I see a lot of people who think the correct way to merge is to pick a spot right away, stop, and force yourself in.  Those people irritate me just as much as they do you.  If I don't have a good chance to merge without impacting traffic, I won't attempt that move. People who cross the 35w/94 double white line near Lyndale do far more damage to traffic flow than anyone like me."
TwinCities,38iwd2,bobpuller,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:12:26 2015 UTC,"I meant people like you in the sense of just grouping all of you who merge out of traffic temporarily just to re-merge in shortly after. You yourself jumping ahead a the traffic jam, but a vast majority of the time causing an inconvenience to the people around you.   My vehicle is governed at 65 so even driving at the speed limit I see people constantly speeding around me just to literally get in front of me (a single vehicle). But in doing so they then have to immediately brake hard for the upcoming turn/offramp. In turn causing me to have to brake for them to marge back in.   ""People who cross the 35w/94 double white line near Lyndale do far more damage to traffic flow than anyone like me.""  Don't get me started. And just as bad as them is those who cross the solid white lines in tunnels. Where you literally have to drive under a sign that says ""Do Not Cross Solid Lines"". Then a minor accident occurs and the whole tunnel gets shut down for that special person."

If i can't do a maneuver smoothly enough it's too aggressive and I don't do it.  I only aggressively pass if there is something to be gained by doing so, such as otherwise free flowing traffic being blocked by a chumbolone driving under the speed limit in left lane."

TwinCities,38iwd2,Manndrake,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:31:45 2015 UTC,"I've been caught in that 5 bridge mess a few times.  In fact I completely re-routed my morning commute - I'm going eastbound into St. Paul - because of it. It was bumper to bumper, and really long waits when the construction started.

TwinCities,38iwd2,megavega420,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:02:32 2015 UTC,"Since nobody has suggested a route I'll give you my advice. Davern St. to Sheperd and take it East. Take 35E across the river and stay in the right lane to exit right away at Highway 13 (Sibley Memorial Highway). Once on Sibley Memorial Highway take Victoria Road South and follow it across Lexington Ave, and then take a left once it connects back to Hwy 13. Take Hwy 13 south and then take a left on Pilot Knob Road. Take Pilot Knob until you get to 494 and then go West.   I can pretty much guarantee you this is the fastest route for where you are going. My route is essentially from St. Paul to the MSP Airport, and this is the fastest way I have found now that 5 is under construction."
TwinCities,38iwd2,megavega420,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:40:22 2015 UTC,"Man I just looked that up on Google maps and it looks crazy. I can see how there might not be many slowdowns but the added distance and large amount of lights and stop signs on the route are going to make it just as bad if not significantly worse. I mean it's saying it takes 23 minutes without any traffic; my morning drive has been 20-25 minutes WITH traffic (crossing the 5 bridge!).  I can also get to my work by taking 62 and exiting at Portland, going south. The usual way of getting there is taking the highway 5 bridge and then immediately exiting once across the bridge, but I could use your idea of going south on 35E and then hopping on 110, which runs into 55 and then 62."
TwinCities,38iwd2,megavega420,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:28:35 2015 UTC,"This route is the bees knees until 5 opens back up completely. I've tried many different routes from the airport to st. paul, and even the things you've mentioned above. But the route I typed out is the quickest way when their is any standstill on 494/35.   And crossing 35 from Shepard is always quick, because 35's 3rd lane start with that on ramp, and you are taking the first exit. Looking from the map too, you shouldn't be hitting any lights on Shepard, and unfortunately by 830 the lights on the on ramp are probably guaranteed to be on and slow ya down their. And then from their to 494 it's only 4 lights, and maybe 3 or 4 stop signs at small intersections. Allowing you to quickly get through them."
TwinCities,38iwd2,bobpuller,0,Fri Jun 5 20:52:15 2015 UTC,"All the tips and short cuts I see in this thread are essentially just taking exits and exit lanes in order to bypass the people merging correctly. Saving yourself time, and creating an even bigger traffic jam for everyone behind you."
TwinCities,38iwd2,megavega420,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:35:07 2015 UTC,"When you get creative, you are in a way increasing the ""capacity"" of the road.  Which is a win for everybody.  The real problems are timid drivers, people who merge too early, people who stop to merge (those two go hand in hand often.)  Also people don't leave space in front of them to facilitate merging, often out of spite because some people have traffic patterns figured out better.  There was a time I would never use those tricks.  But if you actually understand merging, your negative impact is slim to none.  There is almost always a natural opening if you're patient."
TwinCities,38iwd2,bobpuller,0,Fri Jun 5 16:06:41 2015 UTC,"I understand merging, and agree with you on most of your points.

TwinCities,38ctgi,MisterCancer,34,Wed Jun 3 13:48:52 2015 UTC,"When the fuck are we going to get over this whole ""Sex is scary and should be avoided at all costs"" mentality?   My issues with what happened were that the parents weren't notified that the kids were being taken on a field trip. IMHO, that's a big no-no; I don't care if you're taking them to the Dodge Nature Center or the Science Museum, if you take the kids off school grounds you notify the parents. Knowing the store, if I had a kid going there I probably wouldn't have raised any objections about their plans, but you can bet I'd have been quite upset that they didn't tell me they were taking the kids off school property.  And while I wouldn't call Smitten Kitten a den of iniquity and smut, they may have opened themselves up to fines from the city by not taking some precautions in preparing the store. Granted, most of the stuff there is pretty harmless looking, but they do sell straight up porn and some of the product packaging is a bit more explicit. It was just stupid of the store not to do a bit more CYA on this one.   If it's thought of as a stigma, then it will become a rebellion thing.   There will always be a rebellion factor about this kind of stuff, whether it's stigmatized or not. If it isn't about the taboo nature of sex it'll be about who they're with.   Show them it's nothing to worry about and move the fuck on.    Which is an entirely healthy attitude to have about this. Parents can only exert so much control over their kids, and the best thing they can do is make sure they're acting safely and responsibly as much of the time as possible, and education is an important part of that.   Cool your jets, your kids are not kids anymore.   But they also aren't the school's kids, and that is where I would say the issue is for me. The parents know the neighborhood where the school is, they know the people at the school, they know what the facilities are like, and they know that if an emergency comes up where they can find and contact their kids, or if there's an emergency at the school they know what will happen with the kid.  The minute you take the kids off school property all that goes out the window. And while I wouldn't exactly call this the riskiest of of field trips in the history of modern education, it doesn't negate the fact that the school assumed a degree of risk pertaining to the kids without the consent of the parents, and I feel that was wholly improper."

I will probably get downvoted into oblivion (I usually do), but I think a lot of the pleasure and excitement of adolescence is in the discovery. I may very well be wrong, but I think 90% of the inventory of a store like this is female-focused. Yes, there is some girl orifices to boy orifice crossover, but a curious young woman has dozens of avenues to discover en route to spasmtown. Why put a vibrator in front of her and end all that experimentation? I have no scientific evidence, but if that's how you learn to ""exorcise the demon"" you body might take a long time to learn how to get off in a couple's-type situation, which is a whole different set of stimuli. Same goes for boys. If he gets all his boner-bending experience in the death grip of some unrealistically stimulative orifice simulator, he will have trouble getting to the ""summit of Mount Kilimanjaro""  in the relatively boring orifice of a willing boy or girl.

Unfortunately most of the community in the area is powerless to remove the petty thugs and criminals from the area, the police are a bit overwhelmed by it as well. Everyday in that area there is shit like this going on, gunshots being fired, theft, burglary, cars being broken into, gangs running around beating people up for cred, etc.   I had to move out of the area around 7th and Payne because I just did not feel safe. Had some pretty close calls with being jumped or having my shit broken into. I feel bad for the families that have homes over there that are too poor to move or cant for some reason. Perhaps some have gotten used to it or are just oblivious. I hope that something  more is done in the future to address the issues. The families and people that live there deserve much better. Some seriously scary stuff has happened over there. I was only there for a little under a year, but it was enough for me. Im much happier and feel much much safer in SE Mpls."

TwinCities,387x2i,C0ntents,6,Tue Jun 2 15:11:06 2015 UTC,"IIRC, no. Stingrays are not exclusively covered by the PATRIOT Act. Depending on how the ISMI IMSI Catcher was used and why it would be covered under other surveillance laws. Wiretaps and concealed tracking devices are legal to be used, within certain limitations as laid out under other laws and regulations.  So, for example, finding, tracking, and tapping in on the calls of a known murderer using an ISMI IMSI Catcher would be entirely legal, even if the entirety of the PATRIOT Act were struck down.   Edit: Typos."
TwinCities,387x2i,Kichigai,3,Tue Jun 2 16:53:18 2015 UTC,However a ISMI has everyone in the area involuntarily connect to it versus a line tap which is individual.  I don't know how these things are legal.  ugh
TwinCities,387x2i,C0ntents,6,Tue Jun 2 17:35:10 2015 UTC,"However a ISMI   You mean an IMSI Catcher. IMSI is just an ID number assigned to your SIM or R-UIM to identify your phone to the carrier, so they know where to route calls, who to bill, etc. etc.   has everyone in the area involuntarily connect to it versus a line tap which is individual.   Correct, but an IMSI Catcher is not a de facto line tap. Individual connections are encrypted to prevent a degree of line tapping. I'm not an IMSI Catcher has the capacity to decrypt all incoming and outgoing connections simultaneously, as it is designed to allow law enforcement to select which connection they wish to break the encryption on.  Now, you may wonder, ""gee, I'm worried they'll tap me trying to find someone else,"" and that would be a valid concern. However that's not the case here. Because all connections are identified with an IMSI it's easy to select the right one. Your carrier knows what your IMSI is, and to a degree some information can be reverse engineered to determine what your IMSI is, as parts of the number are publicly known (specifically the numbers that identify the account's ""home"" country and the carrier). And through deduction that number can be nailed down more specifically if someone's location is known at a given time.  Also by the way an IMSI Catcher operates it doesn't connect ""everyone."" It has to identify itself as a base station belonging to a certain carrier, and therefore everyone on other networks will be unaffected. Also any users in a location where an authentic base station is presenting a stronger signal will be uneffected.   I don't know how these things are legal.   Because they aren't wiretaps, and generally speaking you shouldn't have any expectation of privacy on a wireless network. It's the nature of the beast.  IMSI catchers are often used for tracking an individual (as opposed to, say, just a vehicle, which someone can abandon) and they work inside buildings (where GPS does not). This can be used as corroborating evidence in a trial, or to identify the region in which wanted criminal is in (as trilateralization isn't accurate enough for more detailed tracking). It's also completely legal to get warrants through the court system to use these systems. This can be done in a ""passive mode"" where the IMSI catcher does not actually process any connections, but merely monitors for phones announcing their identity.  It's not that much different than if you were tracking someone using radio direction finding to identify where someone was using a CB Radio or something, which is done by the FCC all the time to track down sources of interference in licensed spectrum. You're freely carrying around a transmitter in your pocket that's shouting its location every second or so, you shouldn't be too shocked when someone finds a way to exploit this.  And as I said, you shouldn't have any kind of expectation of privacy on a cell network. The basic encryption used on GSM Networks was broken more than ten years ago (PDF warning), and more recently employed encryption schemes have been broken more recently. Unless you're using auxiliary encryption on top of that (like SSL) then I wouldn't trust any communications to be secure. That's like whining that someone broke into your home Wifi network, even though you were still using a WEP64 key instead of newer encryption schemes.  Now at this point it doesn't seem that KASUMI (AKA: A5/3, the encryption scheme used in 3G and newer networks) is breakable using an IMSI Catcher, which presents an issue: the user of an IMSI Catcher can either force you onto a 2G network where they can break the encryption (which you would notice, and both parties in a phone call could easily detect) or simply lurk in Passive Mode, which does not attempt to break any encryption.  IMSI Catchers in Active Mode are pretty easy to discover. For one, you'd lose your connection to the Internet and the rest of the cell network. There is also software you can use to detect them, and physical hardware dedicated to this task is in development.  Also it's extremely unlikely that an Active Mode IMSI catcher could be used on an aircraft like the one in this article. The signal presented by the base station onboard would be too weak to convince any cell phone to connect to it, rather than the local tower, and any connections made would be extremely brief. If it were an IMSI Catcher it would likely be operating in Passive Mode, but operating it from such an altitude would only provide enough information to know if anyone was simply in town; not even enough information to indicate what neighborhood someone was in."
TwinCities,387x2i,Kichigai,6,Tue Jun 2 18:20:27 2015 UTC,"Great info here but you are being extremely optimistic in law enforcement's adherence to the rules regarding operation of high power skimmers (like the ones on planes).  I used to design the hardware for long range cell interceptors that were/are used by law enticement and private agencies across the world,  we were routinely asked to include an active ""bulk collection"" option and transport layer (pass to decryption software) in our software that collected all available packets regardless of IMSI/ESN. I sat and watched our clients mindlessly sift through thousands of decrypted messages from hundreds numbers numbers just looking for something interesting in an area. They didn't give a shit if they even  had permission, let alone a warrant.... I'm not in the industry anymore and it's been long enough that I can probably tell you more but PM me if you want to talk about it."
TwinCities,387x2i,TheMooseyOne,4,Tue Jun 2 20:22:31 2015 UTC,"but you are being extremely optimistic in law enforcement's adherence to the rules regarding operation of high power skimmers (like the ones on planes).   Well, no, I'm not being optimistic about law enforcement's adherence to the rules. If I remember right there are a number of documented cases where IMSI Catchers were used improperly. I'm merely pointing out that the law does provide for the use of an IMSI Catcher outside of the PATRIOT Act, and that there are use cases that would justify the existence of such a device.  I think we need a great deal more oversight as far as how these devices are used because of their great potential for abuse. But such is true of all surveillance techniques. I'm just pointing out how these devices are considered legal by the judiciary, and the limitations of both the devices themselves and the security they think they have in the infrastructure.  But the fact is that we are talking about radio signals being blasted out into the world for all to hear, and I don't think anyone should have an expectation that it would secure, especially since we have a number of documented examples that show the existing systems have glaring security vulnerabilities.  And I mean that outside of the use of IMSI Catchers by law enforcement. From the case studies I've heard about it wouldn't be all that hard for anyone with a couple thousand dollars in disposable income to cook up a similar device using a laptop, some cheap antennas and a software defined radio. Nothing to stop organized crime from building their own, or even a stalker.  My point is that people can't simple sit around and white ""wah wah, this one device exists and I don't like it"" when they've got a machine sitting in their pocket blabbing everything they say to anyone with a properly shaped piece of wire. If it's really that sensitive a thing, then don't talk about it on a cell phone. Period. Because it's not just law enforcement who might be listening in."
TwinCities,387x2i,Kichigai,3,Tue Jun 2 20:35:00 2015 UTC,"Totally understand and agree with you, honestly if you have access to a powerful computer (or ssh access to a cluster at pretty much any major university) you can build the hardware and decrypt messages yourself. I think the uncomfortable thing is people don't expect that there are individuals just sitting around paging through their communications sometimes literally just out of boredom. Also the security on the laptops they used was basically nonexistent in terms of physical and digital accessibility, if anyone working in the building wanted to plug in a flash drive they could steal millions of transmissions in minutes. So I'm on the same page as you,  no one should have the expectation that phones are secure any more."

Actually, a lot of the city lakes have pretty damn good fishing because motorboats are prohibited, which means most hardcore fishermen will go elsewhere. It's pretty awesome. Good bluegill fishing, too, but most are small.  Also, you live in a city with several awesome rivers to fish right nearby. Mississippi, Minnesota, St. Croix, Rum, Crow, Sunrise, Vermillion, Cannon. All good fishing rivers. If you walk down past Minnehaha Falls to the mouth where Minnehaha Creek dumps into the Mississippi River, you can catch a lot of nice fish right there at the mouth. Dozens of different species of fish. Catch-and-release for walleye means there are some honker walleyes but you can't keep them. White bass, channel cats, redhorse, drum, crappie, you name it, it's in there. I've caught 20 fish in an hour there.  Once you get out of the city proper, shorefishing isn't as available.  I'd start out with a worm and a bobber, cast to gaps in the weeds and structure like downed trees and weed edges. Switch to a small rubber jig and retrieve it to try for bigger fish. Throw a spinner if you want to see if there's anything aggressive around. Or get up at the crack of dawn and cast a frog lure like a hula popper for bass.   Yeah your overhand loop knot will work - just make sure the loop won't slip. Braid is hard to tie good knots in. I personally wouldn't opt for braid because of this except when fishing heavy tackle for muskies and catfish. You catch more fish with light line.  As for spots, on the city lakes look for weedbeds, fallen trees, etc. Most of the city lakes have pretty small panfish. Lake Hiawatha has some decent bluegills, especially on the south side by the pier. All the lakes will produce bass, especially early and late.  West of you, south of Minnetonka, is Minnewashta Lake which has nice bluegills and a big park to fish from shore. West of that is the cool Carver Park Reserve which has about eight different lakes with lots of public shore access. Auburn Lake, Steiger Lake, and Parley Lake have a lot of big bluegills. Zumba has a few big crappie. There are a lot of little lakes and bays off the beaten path in the Park Reserve; you can probably find some pretty damn good fishing if you explore on foot.  That's all I really know; I'm more of a river guy so I only fish lakes occasionally.  Hope this helps."

TwinCities,3855nn,dullyouth,2,Tue Jun 2 01:10:53 2015 UTC,"My advice, as in extremely-avid fisherman, beyond what this fine gentleman provided to you, is to make use of your canoe, and your ability to leave the metro. There is some of the best freshwater fishing in the country if you expand your scope to 3 hours radius from home (and venture into Wisconsin). Pack the tent, cooler, canoe, dog, and girlfriend, (among other things), and you'll have a lifetime of fun. Exploring is the most fun part. AT this point you're in it for the long-game, but what you discover will be worth it."
TwinCities,3855nn,Jauntalope,2,Tue Jun 2 02:33:36 2015 UTC,"1, 2) a river is generally better for shore fishing on my experience.  Coon rapids dam, grey cloud area, depends where you live I guess.  3) usually your basic slip bobber with a worm, leech, or whatever.  On the river a slip sinker above a floating jig can be good but you might snag a lot depending on where you are.  4) don't know  5) I would get a 2 piece instead of telescoping.  Whatever you like at fleet farm I guess, shore fishing isn't usually much finesse to it.  6) are you describing a Palomar knot?  That's a good knot."
TwinCities,3855nn,C0ntents,2,Mon Jun 1 23:39:51 2015 UTC,"I fished Coon Rapids dam a whole day and had no luck two weeks ago.  Mostly worms on a bobber.  I tried all over, any tips on where and what depth you are set?"

TwinCities,3855nn,bradtwincities,2,Tue Jun 2 16:20:09 2015 UTC,"Coon Lake especially early in the year is amusing, for catching many, many little panfish.  You probably wont keep many(because they're small) buy you can catch a whole bunch.  There's a back channel you can fish with a canoe just fine, and can put in right next to the actual landing on the big lake.  For reference, I was out there with my dad before the walleye opener mainly to make sure the boat was good for opener.  Fishing with artificial bait and bobber, we ended up with a race to 100 fish, which was completed in under an hour and a half.  It was completely ridiculous.  With a cane pole it probably would have been more/quicker.  Though, out of the 200+ panfish caught, we only kept 7 that were worth cleaning to eat.  It more or less runs all summer for being able to always catch quite a few panfish there.  Though, size is usually a problem.  The back channel I mentioned and the channel between the two lakes are safely accessible by canoe and decent fishing.  I've not been there in years, but, Crystal Lake used to be good for panfish both from shore and in a canoe.  It's another lake without boat waves.  The Coon Rapids dam has been mentioned,  from the park I've caught pretty much everything from the river there.  When I was young I used to ride my bike down there and go fishing.  This sounds like the knot you're describing. It's what we use for pretty much everything and it's perfectly fine for braided line.  We have it on the Musky setups with 80lb test."

TwinCities,3855nn,Tuilere,2,Tue Jun 2 16:20:20 2015 UTC,"I will toss out a couple of other spots, western suburbs but inside the loop.   Medicine Lake N. of Hwy 55 and W. of 169 has two decent shore spots, one in French Park (permit req) and the other on the West side in a park.   I have in the past caught Crappie, Bluegills, Bass and Northern from the West side park.  Also there is Eagle Lake just north of there, with a couple of shore spots that I have gotten decent pan fish from.  Lastly, and I have not fished it for years, Minnetonka has many places to fish from, starting with Grays Bay near the boat launch, if you hit up the Bait store on 394 just west of 494 they can point you to a few spots.  (and tell you what is being caught on what)"

TwinCities,37zrdm,Mpls_Is_Rivendell,9,Mon Jun 1 12:18:56 2015 UTC,"Wait -- Hillary never had a chance?  Is this what you're saying?  Besides the fact that the election is 16 months away and several people have ""a chance,"" she is widely understood to be the frontrunner and in polls she has a wide margin over any possible contenders.  Like her or hate her, you shouldn't ignore that the polls show us that she's the heavy favorite to be the next president."
TwinCities,37zrdm,HAL9000000,-3,Mon Jun 1 14:30:39 2015 UTC,"Polls this early are pretty meaningless, as evidenced by history.  But yeah, when she doesn't get the DNC nod just be sure to remember I predicted it.  I would prefer her actually over lots of candidates, and would have voted for her over Romney.  But my overall point is that Bernie would be a cakewalk to beat in comparison.  I am expecting a relative unknown like O'Malley (who only suffers from lack of name recognition) to get the actual nomination.  The only way I see Hillary avoiding that is if she refuses to debate anyone."
TwinCities,37zrdm,Mpls_Is_Rivendell,2,Mon Jun 1 15:46:18 2015 UTC,"Polls don't mean everything and sure it's possible that she doesn't get the nomination, but to say that she ""never had a chance"" is more than ridiculous. That is what I was responding to.  Frankly though, I don't think you really understand how the actual process works.  She is so far ahead in the polls (much, much farther ahead now than she was compared to Obama in 2008) that her nomination is almost certain.  Name recognition is a huge factor and regardless of how her challengers do between now and next spring/summer they're unlikely to be able to get ahead of her."
TwinCities,37zrdm,HAL9000000,-3,Mon Jun 1 16:00:19 2015 UTC,"She never had a chance for several reasons.  Most importantly she is too old, again the polls are not going to sway me.  Next, there is a LOT of distrust towards her in the party already and as we get closer more contenders will close the gap in a hurry.  Finally, she is a woman and there is a very real undercurrent of sexism in the Democratic party that often people miss.  I know you will disagree with this but again, when it happens remember I said this."
TwinCities,37zrdm,Mpls_Is_Rivendell,2,Mon Jun 1 16:21:31 2015 UTC,"You're totally missing the point.  It doesn't matter whether the polls sway you.  The polls clearly show that she has an incredible lead.  I assume you realize that the polls represent the results of polling organizations calling the public and asking ""who are you going to vote for for president?""  If people didn't trust her, she wouldn't be leading in the polls.  If sexism was going to prevent her from winning, she wouldn't be leading in the polls.  What you're saying doesn't make any sense.  Sure, I'll remember how uninformed you are about political science.  At this point, the only person who has a chance to beat her in the primaries is Bernie Sanders -- and that would be an historic comeback (much, much more of a comeback than when Obama beat her 8 years ago).  I think the difference between you and me is that you are telling me how you hope things will play out and I'm telling you how all of the data and history says things will play out."
TwinCities,37zrdm,HAL9000000,-2,Mon Jun 1 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"No, as I said her becoming President is fine with me.  She is not a crackpot.  I never understood why the DNC didn't nominate her over Obama in fact.  You say I am ignoring political science but you are ignoring how flawed polls can be this early.  Not everyone is answering those calls or even honestly.  Yes, I understand how aggregate polling works, no it doesn't change my opinion and I will still expect you to make a post saying I was right when it happens."

I walk into Cub and I can't even imagine how much the prices are more. The only thing I stay away from at Aldi is the refridgerator packs of veggies, they have a weird taste about them.   It almost seems as if they are subsidizing their prices or something it's so cheap."
TwinCities,37qgcc,Mamertine,1 point,Fri May 29 18:49:44 2015 UTC,They can be cheaper since they do a huge volume in sales and they only stock a brand or two of each product so they need less space.
TwinCities,37qgcc,AnneElk,1 point,Sat May 30 00:01:44 2015 UTC,They only take  3% (or some other puny amount) on fresh vegetable and produce. It's part of their corporate culture. It also generates traffic.

Cub is pretty expensive."
TwinCities,37qgcc,deltarefund,1 point,Sat May 30 06:16:15 2015 UTC,yeah Cub is by far the most expensive. I think it's because they have the huge store+parking lot+advertising+corporate overhang that Aldi doesn't have

People were giving him money, and at one point he stopped, counted it, and then headed up to the woods by the old trolley tunnel near the Cathedral... to buy drugs from the guys that had a little operation going there that year. After about 30 minutes of what looked like smoking crack, he stumbled back down to his spot and started begging again.

It would be easier than my current job, and cerntainly less stressful, but it would be boring and lack a purpose and I wouldn't be okay with that.  Also, to everyone complaining about how a ""homeless"" person wouldn't take food from them please try and remember that food is the most easily acceptable aid for the homeless.

TwinCities,37nvi4,ZKXX,2,Sat May 30 22:20:28 2015 UTC,"I think people make a choice on the first use (or maybe the first couple), but the reality is that addiction fundamentally changes how a brain operates. Addicts lack the ability to make choices in the same manner that they could before they started using. It's not as simple as choosing not to be an addict anymore. Their brain sends signals saying that isn't an option.  When someone quits smoking I think it's WAY more than just a choice to stop. I think that people who overcome addiction are motivated by a belief that their life can be better. I think people who accept and wallow in their addiction have reached a point where they no longer have the belief that their life can be better. I find that sad.   People spend a lot of time hating addicts for living lives that we find ""pathetic"", etc. We judge them for ""choosing"" to live a life that we would never want. But, I think it's important to remember that it's probably (almost guaranteed) not the life they wanted either. Chemical imbalances in their brain (from a couple poor decisions as teens/young adults) took them from being a kid that wanted to be an astronaut to an adult who thinks the best they can ever have is a jar full of small bills and a temporary release of seratonin."

There are exceptions to these common norms, but that's kind of the best place and time to find them. No one person has an exact science of what causes them to grow or where they will be. But a dead or dying elm tree at the right time of year will probably have some growing around it's drip line.  They are tasty, and highly coveted because they can't be farmed. Morels have a large following of people who like the joy of the hunt and go out and wander through the woods checking ""their spots"" for morels each year."

But that forces cleaning companies to offer the lowest price possible, making the industry notorious for abusing its labor force, which consists of recent immigrants.   Kinda hard to go to the proper authorities when doing so means you might get deported.

I'd be interested to see if this lawsuit has any effect on other large businesses that use third party cleaning crews.  I'm guessing it has zero impact on other companies and probably won't even really affect the companies involved in this story.  They'll just pull their contract and go on to some other company.

Declare bankruptcy, apologize for the company being out of money, and start a new cleaning company the exact same way with a different name.  Legitimately run businesses can hardly compete with it.

Sharing the street is the law. Being on a bike and not being as fast as a car is not ""being a jerk."" It's being a bicyclist! Slowing down a little on a neighborhood street to allow for diverse street use and street life should not be seen as an inconvenience. The difference in arrival time slowing down to 25 or even 20 in a 30 zone should not destroy your life or cause breakdowns, and if it does, please see an authorized physician and discuss meds.

That's like saying someone driving slowly due to weather is a safety issue.   No flashers, no vest. The bright green bike is the only saving grace.   Nice Rides have two flashing red lights in back (that turn solid red when the brakes are applied) and a flashing white light in front.  The thing is, though, neither pedestrians, cars, nor motorcycles have flashers on them, but people manage to see them during the day. Why is the fact that we're talking about a bicycle change that? As a motorist you're responsible to be aware of your surroundings, and if in broad daylight you can't make out a cyclist without them being decked out in lights then you either need to see an optometrist or slow down."

As a driver, I would err on the side of you getting to bike safely in traffic rather than switching between sidewalk and road. There are few things worse than being surprised by a bike popping suddenly into traffic from behind a parked car, so to be predictable, ride in the street.

TwinCities,37hiuh,Dawnbreaka,2,Wed May 27 19:07:23 2015 UTC,"Well, not exactly. Here's the exact quote:   No person shall ride a bicycle upon a sidewalk within a business district unless permitted by local authorities. Local authorities may prohibit the operation of bicycles on any sidewalk or crosswalk under their jurisdiction.   St. Paul generally won't ticket you unless it is either signed no-no, or you're being an epic jerk and running over old ladies on their way to play bingo."

TwinCities,37f8ny,lumg-ylem,3,Wed May 27 04:50:46 2015 UTC,"Webdev here.  I am not familiar with specific programs locally but can offer some advice.    Certificate programs are pretty much useless for getting a job in this field but any education is worth while for the education itself.  Go for the degree but understand that you will hardly learn anything that will get you more than a very basic Junior Designer type position based just on what you learn at college.  College is great, don't get me wrong, but the technology and web design world moves so fast that college just cannot keep up.   My advice... go for the degree but spend your free time teaching yourself as well. This is something you will have to do for the rest of your career regardless. Subscribe to /r/webdev, /r/web_design, /r/Frontend, /r/html5, /r/css, and all sorts of web design subreddits.  Sign up for Freecodecamp. Take the free webdesign classes on codecademy.  And basically just start a routine of constantly teaching yourself new technologies, new skills, and in the process you'll also be getting tons of practice.  Have fun with it. It may sound like a lot of extra effort to be done in free time and not even getting paid... but I LOVE my job... it isn't even work, its play!"
TwinCities,37f8ny,nekurashinen,3,Wed May 27 07:25:09 2015 UTC,"also... an art degree is pretty valuable already in the Front-end web design world.  That may be all the credentials you need ""officially"".  Look into UX (User Experience Design) as well as Front-end Designer positions.  See what technologies those jobs are looking for... then teach yourself them through the internet's VAST array of online resources for them.  Sounds like you have the design eye already and most of that is hard if not impossible to teach.  The markup languages and light javascript may be a struggle at first but they should come pretty easy eventually."

Most computer things you are good at it because since a young teen you fiddle with things or made things as jokes, for friends, just because you were interested. By the end of high school you're pretty good at it. By college you're dropping out after the first year because you already know how to design, code, fix things and can get a job and get some experience. By early twenties you're the best and companies will hire you based off what you know and can do.   Maybe this thread will help http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37c2p3/high_schoolers_what_do_you_want_to_major_in/  Not saying it's impossible but you'll be learning new programs, techniques, gotta make connections.

One trip being dropped off from the airport where they put people on going to widely spaced out locations and dropped me off last, taking about 45 minutes extra.

NE Minneapolis, Roseville, Hopkins, Golden Valley, Richfield, would all be options for you. If you're looking for more culture, to be closer to downtown (but not IN downtown), more unique restaurants, then I'd recommend NE Mpls. If you're more a fan of inner/first-ring suburbs, any of the others would be fine.   Would you be renting or buying? That may change things, too. Drive your own car to work, or take public transportation?"
TwinCities,37d2rx,popdisaster00,1 point,Tue May 26 19:49:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to respond. Yeah, I know it's early but I'm a chronic over planner.   We would probably be looking to rent at first with eyes on buying once we know for sure we're well settled. That way we could have time to learn the neighborhoods better. We own two cars right now. I'm willing to drive but I'd prefer to take public transit if at all possible. My wife prefers driving just because her schedule can be erratic as a teacher and she doesn't like to be tied to a bus schedule.  I think my experience living in Milwaukee for a couple of years made me put an emphasis on finding the right neighborhood. There are some very nice parts of Milwaukee and some really terrible areas you wouldn't want to walk alone through. But Milwaukee has a really terrible inner city poverty problem combined with some of the worst segregation in the country. I never noticed anything in Portland and never felt like I was in a ""bad"" part of town. Thanks again. I'll keep my eyes on this sub."
TwinCities,37d2rx,popdisaster00,1 point,Tue May 26 20:03:32 2015 UTC,"Glad to help. I think that, in all reality, there are plenty of neighborhoods that you'd be happy in. I am partial to south and southwest Minneapolis, but they aren't always the most affordable options. St. Paul is really gaining a lot of traction again recently too, and there are some really good neighborhoods there too (I really like the Macalester-Groveland area).   One of the only areas that a lot of people avoid here is North Mpls. I'm not saying I have an opinion on the area either way - I have plenty of colleagues and friends that live in North and love it there - but statistically, it's higher in crime."
TwinCities,37d2rx,evelyndaly,2,Tue May 26 20:09:04 2015 UTC,"Hamline-Midway in St. Paul is a great, centrally-located neighborhood with easy access to the Green Line (to get to either downtown area for nightlife), Snelling (to go anywhere north—which will be against traffic during rush hour—including Roseville for gaming), and HWY 94. It is still pretty affordable for now and has lots of kids. University Avenue has tons of great Asian restaurants, and property values are on the rise.  Given that you've lived in big cities and your wife has worked with immigrant communities, you might look into Frogtown also. It's next to Hamline-Midway, so all the benefits I listed still apply. Frogtown is a majority minority neighborhood and tends to get more negative reviews on this subreddit, but my husband and I live there and it's been great. Our mortgage is cheaper than rent would be and our neighbors are fantastic.  You may also want to rent for a year to get to know the area firsthand. In that case, I'd recommend Grand Avenue in St. Paul as a mecca of affordable, historic apartments surrounded by lots of cute shops and restaurants. That would be a great place to spend a year settling in before you buy."
TwinCities,37d2rx,findinthesea,1 point,Fri May 29 03:11:57 2015 UTC,I recently moved here from Milwaukee and have felt mostly underwhelmed. My partner and I settled on Minneapolis because it seemed safer (from a jobs perspective) than Seattle or other cities.    That said there's plenty of good theater in the Cities.
TwinCities,37d2rx,glittergash,1 point,Wed May 27 03:07:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't expect a land of milk and honey. But we want: A) a decent sized metro; B) somewhere within driving distance of our families in central Wisconsin; C) in a state with a history of investing in education as my wife's a teacher; D) and is also affordable with a stable job market. The Twin Cities seams to be the most pragmatic choice."
TwinCities,37d2rx,findinthesea,2,Wed May 27 13:10:39 2015 UTC,"The Twin Cities does have a large immigrant population of Somalis and Hmong families throughout both Minneapolis and St. Paul. The education is great here, but the academic disparity between student demographics is extremely harsh. My boyfriend is an educator, so I share with you only because I heard it from the horse's mouth. Overall the Twin Cities is a dope place. I've lived here my whole life so I think I'm starting to feel disenchanted, but in general things are pretty good here: decent sized metro area, nice neighborhoods, food scene is spiking, theater is second to NYC, etc..."

TwinCities,37a3zu,millerm4ster,2,Tue May 26 14:20:49 2015 UTC,"My only note is that not all Pride events are open to the under-18 crowd (because they serve alcohol, or the content of the events isn't ""age appropriate"" or something like that), so keep that in mind if you decide to participate. Otherwise, if you're a bit of a gamer make sure you hit up the little vendor fair in the park.

So I was sitting around without much to do a lot. I ended up volunteering at Habitat for Humanity. I'd go once a week for a good portion of the day, maybe 10-4 or so, and helped renovate a house. Painting, installing trim, etc. It was actually really fun, I got to spend lots of time outside (even inside the house, it was basically outside since the windows had been taken out), the people were great, and I felt like I had done something useful at the end of the day.  Go out and do fun stuff but if you have extra time you should volunteer somewhere. A friend of mine volunteers at a women's shelter - there are a lot of mothers and their children who need some positive attention."

TwinCities,37a3zu,Aucassin,1 point,Tue May 26 07:57:17 2015 UTC,"You mentioned the Twins, but don't forget about the Saints. Tickets are cheap (most expensive seats are $18) and there's spectacle to enjoy beyond seeing some good 'ole Baseball. Plus they're always doing little events, like when they became the Mr. Paul Aints, or handed out bobble-feet dolls.  If you've got access to a car I'd suggest you start hitting up some of the state parks. Most of them have caches for Geocaching, but beyond that there are also tons of hiking and biking trails, not to mention camping and fishing spots too. Lots of great parks in the cities too, if you want to stay more urban. The Grand Rounds has lots of good sights, and the Cedar Lake Greenway will connect you to Downtown (going right underneath Target Field in the process).  If you're into building and tinkering with stuff, you might want to check out the U of M ReUse Program where the school sells off a lot of its old gear. If you want to go out of your way and check out more older stuff there's also Raymond Computer that specializes in old Commodore and Amiga stuff, MidModMen+friends which is a store focusing on mid-century housewares, Your Turn Vintage, and even more out of the way, The Pavek Museum of Broadcasting where the tour isn't just interesting but you can see a Spark-Gap transmitter operated (stand back) and you can play a Theremin.  Maybe consider a Segway tour. Sounds kind of silly, yeah, but you might learn some new stuff and you can say you got to ride a Segway. You could also go on one of Nice Ride's self-guided bike tours. Bring your own bike or rent one of theirs. When planning your route I recommend using Google Maps, as its bicycling directions will prefer routes that are flatter and are either dedicated bike paths or streets with bike lanes. If the biking does it for you, consider one of the many non-race rides that happen in the area, like the St. Paul Classic and the Minneapolis Bike Tour.  It's not exactly exciting, but the St. Paul Farmer's Market is interesting. It's down right next to CHS Field (where the Saints play) just past the end of the Green Line. Lest you think it's all just veggies and flowers you should go walk around. There's a vendor that sells soaps (including shave soaps; once you learn to work up a good lather with one you'll never go back to shaving cream), there's folks who sell meat (some of the best bacon you'll ever buy, plus The Jerkey Lady), and some fantastic cheese (Eichten's has some awesome spreads). You can also visit Golden's Deli for a great meal and check out the guy playing the bagpipe on the corner (only in St. Paul would this happen).  And granted, you know about the Fair, but what about Non-Fair Events? The Mini-Maker Fair is this weekend, and they're even doing a Color Run in July."

TwinCities,37a3zu,fanofdeja,2,Tue May 26 13:48:28 2015 UTC,"eventually the skyway in Minneapolis!   The only issue with that is that the Skyway basically shuts down after 5p, so make sure you plan accordingly.  I'd also add in a bike for some trips (all buses and LRT cars have bike racks) and include the Green Line in your exploration. Go in and check out any shops that catch your eye. Axman, for example, is full of all sorts of surprises, and you can always find something new to taste in the Asian markets.  You can also check out the U of M campus and the Dinky Town area. It's a nice little area, some interesting places to stop and eat, and some unique stores too, like music stores (as in the kind that sell music, not just the kind that sell instruments) and Magus Books & Herbs."

For fucks sake,  if you don't like the pedal pub be an adult and petition the laws be changed accordingly or boycott the management, you don't just act like a child and harass the paying customers while the vehicle is in motion on a high traffic street.  That is about the most immature thing they could have done.  Yes the passengers probably overreacted but that is a risk you take when you start throwing objects at random strangers, somebody is going to get upset and those throwing the balloons are the instigators.  TLDR; the fact that the passengers who happened to be on the pedal pub were off duty police officers is entirely inconsequential and you are using it as a scapegoat for the immature act your friends decided to plan and execute.

Oh and let's do it in broad daylight multiple times in an area where there are lots of police and witnesses.  Obviously the attackers had no intention of hurting their victims, but they did conspire to commit assault against a group they didn't like.  Sounds a lot like a hate crime to me.  They were motivated by hatred weren't they?  What if the target were bicyclists?  How would some of you feel if some people in their late 20s/early 30s drove around Minneapolis attacking bicyclists with water balloons and squirt guns?

Driving behind them might suck, but on the busier roads they tend to hug the bike lanes and on side streets it's easy enough to go around.  I find the ""official"" pub crawls like the Zombie or Wild West or Mardi Gras crawls to be FAR more annoying and bothersome.

I also think they're always fine anywhere after 6 PM and all weekend long.  Example:  They are annoying when it's, say, Friday at 4 PM and they are going through the parts of Downtown that are basically just office buildings and no bars.  When you've finished a long week of work and are sober and tired and waiting for your bus, you don't really want to deal with a pedal pub of yelling drunks going by at 2 MPH in a part of Downtown that isn't known for bars, especially when the people on the pedal pub seem to take joy in yelling at sober people at bus stops.  (Although this still isn't as bad as walking down the sidewalk and having someone suddenly yell at you out of a passing car for no reason, which always scares the shit out of me.)"
TwinCities,3725yb,Tuilere,6,Mon May 25 06:36:27 2015 UTC,"Or can we talk about the fact that someday someone may actually hit one of these things with a car?   You could make the same argument about anyone on a bicycle. Are we going to start banning bicycles based on this logic?   Might be fun to ride through a park or somewhere scenic and safe? Optimally without traffic?   The idea of a Pedal Pub is that it's kind of a pub crawl on wheels. Putting it through a park would eliminate the ""pub"" part of things. However it's not a bad idea in and of itself. I could easily see that working around the Chain of Lakes or something, but you just know that the homeowners in that area would find a way to ban them."
TwinCities,3725yb,Kichigai,7,Mon May 25 06:45:12 2015 UTC,"Lets look at the fact that this is a huge platform full of drunk people on stools that arent protected in any way from harm. Not really the same I dont think.   Neither is a bicycle. Or a motorcycle. And people who are drunk ride bicycles and on the backs of motorcycles. And bicyclists have the same access to the roads as Pedal Pubs have, so they can create the same traffic obstructions as a Pedal Pub.   I dont understand why you feel the need to downvote me and step around my points in a vain attempt to somehow make them invalid?   I didn't downvote you.   Drunk people, not protected, moving very slowly in high traffic areas, not wearing any safety equipment   Like a pedestrian. Except we don't outlaw pedestrians.   with their legs underneath a bunch of metal etc.   Like a motorcycle or a unicycle. Or an antique car.   If you tried doing that with a group of people that was not affiliated with pedal pub you'd all be arrested for public intoxication   Pub crawls happen all the time, they don't get hit with public intoxication, otherwise I doubt the Zombie Pub Crawl would still be going on.   and operating a non motorized vehicle while under the influence.   Except that doesn't happen on Pedal Pubs. A company employee is the person who operates the steering and the brakes on the Pedal Pub, and they remain 100% sober the entire time.   Just because it looks like a bar and you put wheels on it doesn't make it ok.   No, but it is licensed by the state, and they seem to think it's OK.   And btw, if all the drunk people are pedaling the thing, who is steering it?   A sober employee of the company. They know the route, they know which bars they're going to, and they are responsible for the safety of people. The people who rent the Pedal Pub are prohibited from having anything more to do with the operation of a Pedal Pub beyond providing locomotion.   What about while the bartender is pouring drinks?   That would be one of the members of the party renting the Pedal Pub. Also the bartender at any bar they stop at.   What if there is a situation where they need to stop suddenly?    The driver releases the dead-man-switch style brake pedal and the entire vehicle comes to a halt.   Are there seatbelts?   No, but there aren't seatbelts on buses either. Pedal Pubs travel at around 10MPH, tops. If it were to come to a sudden, violent stop it would probably be about as jarring as a Metro Transit bus stopping and starting.   Futhermore, putting them on paths in parks around lakes or something scenic is exactly how I envisioned the ideal situation for them.   Except that was never the deal. The point of the Pedal Pub is to take you to all sorts of different bars along a given route that you select when you make your reservation. There aren't bars in parks, nor is drinking legally allowed in parks, therefore there never was any shred of a possibility that this would have happened, not even a hint.   Safe and enjoyable for those that wish to participate.   Pedal Pubs are safe and enjoyable for those that wish to participate. If you don't feel Hennepin is safe enough, then select another route. For $100 more you can even set up a custom route."

TwinCities,3725yb,AbeRego,8,Sun May 24 15:08:53 2015 UTC,"It's good to remember not too fall into the mob mentality when it comes to things we dislike. I'm not huge on Pedal Pubs because I'm not big on being around drunk people. Instead of being in bars, they're now right by me as I'm driving through the city.  However, they generally aren't that bad. If my windows are up, they usually don't bother me.  While not my favorite thing, that certainly won't get any hostility from me."

TwinCities,3725yb,AbeRego,4,Sun May 24 22:16:25 2015 UTC,"I get some of that article, but he's damn condescending at the end.  People from suburbs are not untrained apes.  Much of the Minneapolis population, myself included, is made up if people who moved here from the burbs."
TwinCities,3725yb,killswithspoon,3,Sun May 24 05:43:17 2015 UTC,"Much of the Minneapolis population, myself included, is made up if people who moved here from the burbs.   That is not true. Most of the MPLS population is made people born and raised in Minneapolis. Some are out of state transplants. But suburban 20 year olds are not the source of culture in Minneapolis."
TwinCities,3725yb,runtheroad,2,Sun May 24 09:05:35 2015 UTC,"I never said that the majority were from the burbs, but come to think of it I don't know a single person who lives in Minneapolis, who was not raised in the suburbs/ out of town.  This also applies to the ""empty nesters"" I know, who moved into Minneapolis after their kids grew up.  This means I know more people who live in Minneapolis, who grew up in Wisconsin, than who grew up in town.   What would you say the source of culture is, then?  My perspective is obviously a bit slanted, but I'd like to know your opinion on that.  I'd argue that the culture is dominated by youth, here.  The Walker, the music scene, the University;  these are all traditionally frequented by the young, even if they are not run by them.  If we're talking about the bar, or drinking culture (which was where this conversation started), most of those patrons are in their 20s or thirties; just walk in on a Friday or Saturday, it's easy to see.  Edit:  I realize they are not all from the suburbs, of course they aren't.  Still, I don't really detect much of a difference between suburban culture, and Minneapolis culture.   We're all Minnesotans, people in Minneapolis just walk more.  Edit:  turns out my roommate lived in Minneapolis until he was 13,  then moved to the suburbs, where he lived until he was around 25. So he's the one person I know who could claim to be a ""native"" of Minneapolis proper."

I've lived in Minneapolis for years and years all over the city: uptown, NE, dinky, and not once have I felt like the pedal pub was any more an issue than drunks walking home at bar close or the idiot drivers who can't understand one-ways or bike lanes.

When people are attacked (even if it's in such a minor way, like this) they'll always respond with as much force as they think they can muster.

These people are a special kind of stupid.  You could have picketed, protested, contacted representatives from pedal pub and petitioned changes to the routes or operating procedures, but nope they acted like children and organized a water gun assault on people who had nothing to do with pedal pub management.  I dislike Walmart but I sure as hell aren't going to run into one and assault a poor minimum wage employee for doing their job, or an innocent customers who doesn't have money to shop elsewhere, because they had nothing to do with the operations on the company as a whole."

What if people were throwing water balloons at bikers downtown? What if the KKK threw water balloons at black kids?  Are those okay activities because ""they're just water balloons""? No, there's an obvious threat to intimidate certain subset of the population.  Yes, this whole thing is ridiculous. But I don't want the government to selectively apply the law, just because the pedal pub is almost universally hated. I want justice to be blind, and laws to apply equally."

Shoot down Oakdale, which runs more-or-less parallel to Robert, but isn't under construction and has proper bike lanes. Then sling shot down Thompson and try and get into Burrito Mercado through the back. If you're in a car, bite the bullet and take the right on to Robert.

TwinCities,3707b9,zivajack,6,Sun May 24 02:56:17 2015 UTC,"It's kind of my go-to and I get that I may be sounding like a broken record for suggesting it, but what about biking? If you don't have bikes it's just $6 (each) to rent a Nice Ride, and those suckers are easy to use. Three gears, quick-releases for the seats, built-in lights, a rack for your bags, cushy seats and tires, and a step-through height so low that even my mother with her bad knee could get on one. Just note that for a 24 hour rental you have to re-dock the bikes once every 30 minutes or else you get dinged $3 extra. But finding docks isn't too hard, there's even an app for that.  The Grand Rounds path around the Chain of Lakes is a smooth ride, and you can pick up bikes in Uptown. Show up a little early, then zip around Lake Harriet, go along Minnehaha Creek, and stop to eat at The Sandcastle. It's only a ~30 minute ride according to Google (which estimates a cruising speed of about 10MPH, which isn't too hard to manage on one of those bikes; just make sure you stop to re-up the bikes outside of Lake Harriet).  Alternatively, if you don't feel like biking back at the end of the date, you could just zip around Lake Calhoun (maybe even Harriet or Lake of the Isles if you're up for it) and then grab something to eat in Uptown. It's still something to get you active, and there are nice sights to see along the paths.  Depending on when the date is, afterwards you could hit up movies and music in the parks.  IMHO, that's not a bad package. You get some physical activity in, you can take in some nice sights, your activity includes a meal, and potentially a show. That's not a bad day, if you ask me."

If you want to do a little more afterwards you can always zip down to the end of the block and rent a couple bikes from the Nice Ride station at the YWCA.

The longer answer is many of them were refugees from Laos. When they came here, they didn't have a lot of money, so they had to live in some of the nearby projects. As many of them also didn't drive, or even know the language, they eventually set up businesses near their home so they could walk to work.   If anyone else remembers frogtown from 30 years ago (yes, I'm that old) it used to be filled with massage parlors, strip clubs, bars, and peep shows. When the Hmongs started businesses there, it was a pretty shady part of town. Again, easier for the Hmong to afford to open a shop where nothing but bars and prostitution was successful.

TwinCities,36vv44,worduphomefry,8,Fri May 22 17:33:06 2015 UTC,"There actually is a real, documented reason for this. It is a bit complicated, so stay with me here:  First, you need to know a little bit of Hmong history. In a nutshell, the Hmong are one of the oldest cultures on the planet, and they have been systematically oppressed by the Chinese for centuries. During the Viet Nam war (and actually preceding it) the CIA recruited Hmong people to help fight the communist invasion. They were promised that in turn, they would be relocated to the US.  Fast forward a decade or two. The war is over and the CIA has mostly gone back on its word. Almost the entire Hmong population of Indochina has been relocated to refugee camps. The camps are atrocious, but the Hmong have no alternatives. American charities such as Catholic Charities and various other church groups begin bringing Hmong families to the US in a sponsorship program. The problem is that Hmong families are huge and multi-generational (there are only 8 Hmong family surnames in the world). But the churches will only bring over Hmong people in small, nuclear-family type unit. In short, the Hmong had a completely different definition of family than the traditional American did.   So small Hmong nuclear families were relocated into white communities. This often meant being the only Hmong in an entire Midwestern town. It also meant being separated from the people they considered to be their close family members. Many family members were often left behind in the refugee camps. Some people lived in those camps for decades.  Now, fast forward again to the 1980's. Saint Paul had a mayor by the name of George Latimer. He saw his city declining in population and struggling economically. He made a declaration that Saint Paul would have an 'open door' policy to all immigrants, and that the city would take measure to encourage refugees from all parts of the world to relocate here. Saint Paul already had a growing Hmong community, and the Hmong who lived here began to gather their families together. Soon, there was such a concentration of Hmong that the area around the state capital that had been historically African-American shifted to being predominantly Asian.   Today, Saint Paul has the largest population of Hmong in North America. Also, Latimer's immigration policy is widely credited for the fact that the Twin Cities has the largest Somali population in North America. In fact, that policy has led to a huge increase in ethnic diversity in the area. We aren't just a bunch of Prairie Home Scandinavian Lutherans anymore."

A member of the DFL and a labor lawyer by profession, the bearded Latimer was known for his redevelopment of St. Paul's downtown core, serving as mayor during a period when St. Paul's population was declining somewhat as some residents moved to suburban areas while the city's ethnic diversity increased as, among others, Hmong refugees from Vietnam and Laos resettled in Saint Paul.

And there is some more misinformation in your data here.  Not all Hmong were relocated to refugee camps - the ones that could make it there or wanted to, sought to go there. And they weren't/aren't terrible places. They're by no means great places and definitely not as good as their own homes, but are not ""atrocious."" People still live in the refugee camps. I actually have students that speak of the camps fondly, like they miss them and like them more than Saint Paul, but I'm not sure that's the most accurate info. Many of my co-workers - American, Hmong, and Karen - have been to various camps (mostly Mae La - here's a walkthrough) and say that the camps aren't 100% safe, don't have enough space, don't have adequate education, and are pretty darn hot, but they aren't ""atrocious"".  Also, the large Asian refugee population isn't only Hmong. There are many Karen people as well and they seem to have it even worse due to little awareness of their position. They are even more insular than the Hmong community because of this.  SOURCE: First-hand knowledge. Teacher in Hmong school. I work with people who have visited the refugee camps, people who have LIVED in the refugee camps, and over 1500 Hmong/Karen individuals. I have also conducted extensive primary and secondary research on this topic and work side-by-side with some of the highest-ranking Hmong community members in the city."

Still goes to show that it is it a very tight knit society. I will defer to your knowledge on the camps, as I have never visited them. My only knowledge of them has come from accounts told to me by people who lived in them. Most of those came from Ban Vinai. As for whether the camps were 'atrocious', I guess that is a relative term. To cut through the rhetoric, they were primitive camps. Some people would have adapted easily to living in them while others would have found the conditions unacceptable.    As for your comment that the large Asian refugee population isn't only Hmong; I never meant to imply that idea. Though I can see how my comment might have been construed in that way. I am well aware of the various ethnicities of refugees that have migrated to Minnesota.

The only way to make sure that you catch that bus every time is to get to the bus stop 5 minutes early and be prepared to stay there 15 minutes past the scheduled arrival time. In winter it's worse, but at least that's understandable because the roads are usually crap then.  On the whole, public transit here is alright. I like the light rail, and some of the buses are punctual. Other routes, though, suck and come infrequently.

Going any other direction, it's non-existent.  If anything, buses are just as reliable in the winter compared to a car.  You don't have to worry about getting towed because of plowing or your car starting, and everyone is stuck in the same slow traffic.  If anything, you might consider getting a bike for the summer and bus/rail in the winter.  Some hearty people do biking in the winter, but the salt+bike+expense and I'm-a-wimp+cold keep me from it.

TwinCities,36r6dp,SaiyanOfDarkness,2,Fri May 22 01:08:01 2015 UTC,"Noise and performance. Consider all the wireless devices around you: every Wifi device, each game console controller, fitness/health trackers, keyboards and mice, set top boxes and TVs. And that's before we get into the Internet of Things.  Now you mention 5GHz, but the thing is that nothing is stopping the encroachment of stuff into 5GHz like we saw with 2.4GHz, or 900MHz before that. The other issue is that 5GHz has more limited range than 2.4GHz, and worse penetration through walls and whatnot.  Now wired is wired. It'll always have way more capacity than wireless, it'll have a lot less issues with different applications shouting all over each other.  Now here's the thing: it's not wired to the exclusion of wireless. You could use the wired network to facilitate the placement of wireless access points where you need them, rather than having to run cables everywhere yourself or being beholden to poorer performing alternatives, like wireless bridging or power line.  Plus it doesn't have to be Ethernet you're running over your lines. There are adapters for running HDMI over a pair of CATA6 lines, for example."

TwinCities,36vtyd,ComebackOfTheYear,1 point,Fri May 22 21:57:01 2015 UTC,You can't seriously think you would win a noise complaint lawsuit against a team that the City built a ballpark for can you?  You proper avenue to resolve this is moving to Lakeville   asshat
TwinCities,36vtyd,ComebackOfTheYear,2,Wed Jul 1 08:58:47 2015 UTC,"I think the reality is you live in a downtown of a city, right next to a ballpark.  Saint Paul grants variances for noise ordinances, and I guarantee that CHS field has one, since luring them to lowertown was such a big mission"
TwinCities,36vtyd,DeadDoug,-4,Fri May 22 15:41:31 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I live in a city. But I had no idea how loud the games would be until last night. I can literally see the field from our windows so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Unfortunately I just signed a new 1 year lease a month ago.  Regarding the variances, those are for city noise ordinances. I'm looking at broader state noise ordinances. Maybe the state legislature granted the Saints an exception. I don't know."
TwinCities,36vtyd,DeadDoug,5,Fri May 22 15:48:52 2015 UTC,Live in the middle of the Capitol city and expect to sleep with the windows open like its out in the quiet country.   It was opening night. Things will calm down but if noise is that big of a deal you're best off moving. They city isn't going to move the park or cancel games and you aren't going to win a lawsuit against them no matter how hard you try.
TwinCities,36vtyd,supremelord,-2,Fri May 22 18:30:36 2015 UTC,"Minnesota has noise ordinances that apply to the whole state. I didn't sign away anything. If the state doesn't plan on enforcing it's laws, then it should take them off the books."
TwinCities,36vtyd,supremelord,5,Fri May 22 15:47:27 2015 UTC,"It's basic common sense that noise ordinances are REALLY lax in major cities. You have to expect that kind of shit. There's always going to be new entertainment venues built, loud parties, celebrations, parades, etc...  It's a real autist belief that they're going to follow the letter of the law in all cases. Chill out and maybe move to one of the suburbs."
TwinCities,36vtyd,supremelord,-3,Fri May 22 16:33:01 2015 UTC,"But these are state laws. As far as I know, city councils cannot counteract state law.   Besides, these are pretty generous laws. 60 dB is really fucking loud inside an apartment. It's the equivalent of someone talking loudly or laughing. It's much louder than the music venue down the street or even a party in the apartment above my own. I know people are giving me a hard time, but if they were in my situation they would understand. It was so loud, I checked if the window was open."

That was kind of my point.   The next time the sound is too loud, call the St. Paul Police non emergency line (651) 291-1111   Will do.   Are they going to stop the baseball game?

That's not really true. Looking up precedent, $20 a day is pretty typical for daytime noise violations. $40 a day is pretty typical for nighttime noise violations. That would add up to $2000 per season, which probably isn't enough to spur any sort of action. That was my point. I doubt small claims court would accomplish anything."

I don't dispute at all that you experienced noise levels above the levels the state regulations allow. What I dispute is that you have a method of proving future suffering, because you don't. You have a method of proving past suffering, which is wholly different.   If you want advice on how to deal with the issue, contact the club and let them know you took meter readings last night and they were too high. Contact the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (the agency that enforces that particular regulation) and tell them the same thing. Contact the City of St. Paul and tell them the same thing.  You are getting a hard time on reddit because you brought up suing a baseball team over a noise complaint, and refuse to accept that you don't have a case worth bringing to court. Were you harmed? Sure. Did you suffer last night? Sure. Is a court going to award you $2000 for it? Not in a million years."

I'd rather put the cat down in an environment less charged and frightening than a humane society.    Calling these animal rescues and foster home agencies was futile and largely thee most demeaning experience in the midwest since I was a child.   I have been going into a house that I am technically not supposed to enter to feed and clean up after my cat.  After this cat I won't bring a pet on an extended project again, certainly I wouldn't own a pet in Minnesota because the pet care industry has to be the biggest ponzi scheme.

TwinCities,36r7wd,TURK3Y,1 point,Thu May 21 21:20:26 2015 UTC,"I've heard that it was because of some of the route selections. It's going through some lower density, wealthier areas. Some of the other route options that were passed over would have cut through some poorer, more densely populated areas.  Personally, I think that is a bit of a moot point, since its usually cheaper to build rail in less dense areas(IE, you only need to tear down homes, and not apartment complexes), and then you can hope that the rail line will bring transit oriented development to areas and see a nice spike in population density.  There are also folks that simply felt like the money may have been better off being spent on other lines/buses/brt that would focus more on the urban core. This is a fair point, but the met council also needs to do some politicking and not just throw all their infrastructure money at Minneapolis. I'd also point out that Minneapolis city living is not going to get cheaper any time soon. Rail lines that reach out into the suburbs, where land values are lower, may provide some more affordable housing options -- and providing transit to those residents.  There's a lot of transit bloggers that circlejerk that this is just subsidising the suburbs. They already think the suburbs get enough 'subsidies' through them getting sprawling road infrastructure.  EDIT: Forgot that there's also suburbanites that don't want it, for a myriad of reasons. Usually because they think it will bring crime to their area. They also think that it will bring multi-family buildings to the area, too (which has a sub-text of low income folks). I also believe that there are some property tax(or sales tax?) assessments within a certain range of the LRT (I may be wrong..). And sometimes you could be effected by that, even though you may be fairly far away from the rail line."

TwinCities,36mx0v,GasStationSushi,15,Wed May 20 16:15:09 2015 UTC,"Why's this downvoted? It's a legitimate question.   Even splitting a 2bedroom with a roommate cuts down on costs dramatically.  https://www.rentjungle.com/average-rent-in-minneapolis-rent-trends/  Average Rent of a 1br in Minneapolis: $889.  Average Rent of a 2br in Minneapolis: $1226.  ($613 per person).  That easily lowers the rent per person by 30%.  Not only that, but then you get to split utilities for more cost saving with a 2br(with only a marginal increase in living space for heating/cooling).  I'm not saying we need to go back to the old school boarding house model for laborers(shared bathrooms, etc), but fuck-- is having a roommate so horrible? I mean, there seems to be a social stigma strong enough that people equate having your own place equivalent to basic food and clean water -- I think that's kind of a fucked equivalency."

Having roommates works for many people.  Having roommates also doesn't work for many people, and doesn't work for many reasons.  Personally, roommates add a lot of stress to my life, and not being able to afford my own place severely degrades my quality of life, overall happiness, and health.  But if I had a kid, there is no way in hell I would live with roommates that were not a life partner."
TwinCities,36mx0v,GasStationSushi,3,Wed May 20 17:47:29 2015 UTC,"Is it reasonable to expect a single parent to require roommates in order to afford housing?   This article is in the context of minimum wage, and rental affordability in relation to that. In MN, 5.4% of those who would be effected by an increase in the minimum wage to $9 would be single parents(living alone with their children).  If you're trying to suggest boosting up minimum wage to effect a very small minority of workers, it'd be a very poor choice.  You would want more targeted programs to assist families with housing(IE, EITC to supplement income, food stamps to cover some food costs, Section 8 to reduce housing costs, and Met Council released affordable housing plans for the next few decades, etc). The minimum wage is an extremely blunt tool to deal with socioeconomic issues.   If a single parent with 2 kids is earning the federal minimum wage, they'd receive $5,236 in federal money through the EITC. They'd receive an extra $1,309 in state money. It would bring their effective full-time wage to $10.40/hr.  Is it reasonable to expect the minimum wage to solve this issue?  which applies equally to 16 year olds living with their parents, as it does to a 28 year old single parent with 3 kids?   Source - PDF for above numbers   Personally, roommates add a lot of stress to my life, and not being able to afford my own place severely degrades my quality of life, overall happiness, and health   Yes, but in the context of this conversation, its far from a need that people seem to be implying.  Having a dog increased my quality of life, happiness, and health. I don't expect the government mandate that I get free dog food for it, or provide free check-ups for a personal living choice that has a positive effect for me. If I value it, I will put my dollars towards it."

TwinCities,36mx0v,coll0412,7,Thu May 21 03:18:21 2015 UTC,Uhh....I would classify housing as a basic need.
TwinCities,36mx0v,coll0412,2,Wed May 20 16:40:47 2015 UTC,"Uh.... that doesn't mean that everyone having their own 1Br apartment is a basic need. There are other options like having roommates, family, etc. I lived in a house with 4 other guys until I was like 25. I had a good roof over my head, had a social atmosphere, and there was nothing wrong with it. All my needs were met, and all of my bills were cheaper. I was paying like $300-$350 a month for my own room in a house, cable TV, internet, electric, gas, etc. That's far better than spending more than twice that on a 1Br.  How was that not meeting (and even exceeding) my basic needs?"
TwinCities,36mx0v,coll0412,4,Wed May 20 16:58:42 2015 UTC,"You clearly missed the point, it's a metric to provide a comparison to. Of choose there are other ways to make it cheaper, you could also love in a tent, or a car, but that would sure complicate an analysis of livability of a city. My point was ""housing"" is a basic need, no on says you have the right to a 1BR appt. it just make a simpler analysis to use the smallest bedroom count from available apartment data, its also an average which can easily be skewed by outliers. The point is that even if you had a roommate in that average two bedroom appartment it still costs $350 a month which represents 34hours of work a week. Point is minimum wage is very low relative to the cost of housing.  1 br is just a metric to compare against. Its like the Star Tribune comment section up in here."
TwinCities,36mx0v,thinkerplinker,2,Wed May 20 18:57:55 2015 UTC,"I didn't miss the point I was asking a question. Not sure why asking about what you stated means I missed the point. If I'm asking questions I'm obviously inquiring more about your thoughts on the matter. I didn't flat out state you were wrong or anything... geez.  Second: so even at $350 a month for rent you're saying that takes 34 hours at minimum wage. Given that's just roughly one week out of a month, that's then roughly 25% of monthly income, and that's not even including extra paycheck months. That's not unusual for living expenses and not unaffordable.  I'm all for raising minimum wage and tying it to inflation. I was only questioning why everyone ""needs"" their own 1br apartment."
TwinCities,36mx0v,dullyouth,1 point,Wed May 20 19:52:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry didn't mean to attack you there. I agree there is no 'right' to a 1BR appt,  its just an easy metric.

Or what if somebody merges into your lane immediately in front of you without maintaining sufficient speed?  These are two situations that can easily cause a rear-end collision in which you, the rear car, will generally not be held liable -- assuming you weren’t speeding or violating some other traffic law."
TwinCities,36ifb6,jakjg,-10,Wed May 20 01:58:20 2015 UTC,There's only one lane and it's shared by bikes and cars so if the car passed the bike then the car had the lane. The biker was at fault for this accident (that doesn't mean it's okay that the car left the scene).

From what I understand it was an unavoidable collision caused by the car cutting in font of the cyclist and then stopping abruptly. In my view that is a car hitting a cyclist.   I did learn through this that the street is more of a quasi suggested bike lane with a little decal of a bike and arrows on the side of the road so not a true bike lane, but I don't think that changes the course of events.   Regardless, fleeing the crash is illegal and I would rather have the police do the investigation to determine fault. I was just wondering if you had any reasoning behind your idea of fault."

I believe there was not enough distance to fully stop due to the car's maneuver so close to the right turn. The 2 witness back up this claim. But with no video and no driver I guess we can never know 100%.  And this does happen in cars, and usually is someone cutting off a driver then slamming on the brakes causing a rear end collision. So who's responsibility is it in that case to keep a safe distance? I would assume the person in front would be at fault right?"

The car was probably the speed limit, which is, at a minimum, is 30mph. And your second argument is hardly even that. Sober drivers are mostly defenseless against drunk drivers, so should sober drivers chose not to drive as they may be struck by a drunk driver? Because, using the logic of your argument, that should be the correct course of action."
TwinCities,36ifb6,txelen,2,Thu May 21 03:42:02 2015 UTC,It would be like a 4 lane (2 in each direction) road and the car on the inside lane turning right across both lanes and suddenly coming to a stop in the path of the outside lane. The car or cyclist could simply apply the brakes to slow down a moment before hitting the vehicle. So that would be illegal as well.

When the number gets to be non-negligible, we will talk.  The red light thing is a double standard, but I don't have a problem with it for the aforementioned reason. It's simply not dangerous. I do not understand why drivers care so much. Often going when the light is red is my only opportunity to get clear of the bunch of cars waiting behind and to the side of me at the lights.  I agree with you that cyclists should ride defensively, but the ones I see who do not are in the minority. Things like ""taking the lane"" are smart safety moves in many places.  I routinely take the lane, then let cars pass me when it is safe. I would prefer to avoid cars, and I am sure they would prefer to avoid me. But when we do interact, I would prefer that they recognize that I am in a fundamentally dangerous position and that they should not try to illegally pass me (ie not leave me three feet or more) and just wait their turn.

I upgraded my pick ups, got a new amp, bought a second electric guitar for other tunings but the one thing I still to need upgrade is my acoustic.  I promised myself that I would buy my dream acoustic with my first welding paycheck and I just graduated.  I work with my hands and I appreciate craftsmanship and I'm MN born and raised so the logo is just awesome, these guitars are right up my alley.  Thank you for sharing this, I will absolutely be checking them out and if they play as good as they look I'll be coming home with one!"

TwinCities,362mrm,bunBpimpC,6,Fri May 15 22:36:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think it comes down to age or size, though. Scientology was basically founded as a money making machine, a pyramid scheme wrapped in the trappings of religion but designed to consolidate money and power in the hands of a single individual (LRH and now the elite of the elite.)   Now yeah, sure -- the Catholics have consolidated a whole shit load of power and wealth. It's a human institution run by humans and prone to corruption. But at least they have some guiding principals that tell them to be compassionate and help people. Scientologists? Not so much. There aren't any Scientologist food banks, homeless shelters, groups going to build houses in Honduras, etc. This is an organization that's worth billions where gaining access can run well north of $100k. They have the money. What one sap pays to brcome an OT III or whatever nonsense could get clean water to a couple villages in Africa. Or buy warm coats for every child in MN whose parents can't afford a warm coat. The money is there but the mission is not.  BTW for the record I'm an atheist. I think both groups are bunk."

The church of scientology is known to break families apart, force child labor, bilk people out of life savings, stalk and harass apostates, and use less-than-honest tactics.  No religion should charge its parishioners to see what the religion is about.  Only at higher levels to ""believers"" learn about Lord Xenu.  This is essentially a government-sancitoned cult."
TwinCities,362mrm,bunBpimpC,1 point,Fri May 15 23:03:58 2015 UTC,"IIRC, some countries classify Scientology as a cult and not a church. I think Norway or Switzerland are examples."

If you mention all the middle eastern countries that currently base their governments on Islamic law (I.E. death penalty for apostasy, oppression of women, curtailment of freedom of speech, in addition to all the other horrible human rights infringing things that come along with basing a government on that law...whether it's a true read or a misinterpretation of the Quran), it's horrible. And not to be biased - look at the Catholic church's history with indulgences, the treatment of Galileo, and the Inquisitions. When you take all that stuff into account, scientology comes out looking like a saint.  If people want to live their lives basing it on BS and whacko ideas, go ahead. As long as they're not hurting other people (which it appears they are) because my only problems with scientology are some of the things you mentioned - forced child labor, stalking apostates, and their tax exempt status."

TwinCities,35y39b,tractorrobot,6,Thu May 14 20:02:34 2015 UTC,"professional iOS developer located in Minneapolis here-  Check out this site: http://howmuchtomakeanapp.com/estimator  I have been involved in app development for about 5 years at a couple different development shops / startups.   Typically the dev shops I have worked at see $15,000 - $20,000 as the bare minimum for getting involved in a project.   A lot of apps can be in the $40,000 - $50,000 area and well beyond.   Also, those numbers are typically just one platform. There are strategies/technologies that allow building for multiple platforms, but in my career we have always done native development on each platform (building iOS and Android apps separately) as that usually results in the best product.   The app market is really saturated, and making money off an app is tough. You either need TONS of users creating ad impressions, or you need some kind of service or subscription that you offer through in-app-purchases. Typically you will also need a website that either offers parallel access to the service, or to be used as a marketing tool.   On that note- because the app market is very saturated, and social media apps require a solid user base to be useful, it is important to remember that just creating the app in the first place is maybe 50% of the effort, both time and money. You need to spend a lot of money and time on marketing in order to build up any kind of user base, and without a really strong marketing strategy, your app will sink to the bottom of the App Store ocean.  If you are interested in trying to take a stab at such a project yourself, I might recommend checking out www.parse.com - a backend service that can be used to spin up the user login and database services for your app.   If you have any specific questions, fire away and I can offer my opinion."
TwinCities,35y39b,tractorrobot,2,Thu May 14 19:43:37 2015 UTC,That is a lot of coin. I wonder if maybe you would let me bounce my idea off of you as long as promise not to steal my idea and let me know with your experience if you think the investment would be worth the time and money. Maybe even the feasibility of the app itself.
TwinCities,35y39b,nekurashinen,3,Thu May 14 20:31:26 2015 UTC,"It is. For those on the outside of the development world, the market is really deceiving because they see all these apps out there that are free or just $0.99. Unfortunately the reality is that app development is an expensive, tedious process and takes many, many hours to complete. It is also a very ongoing process, as software is not perfect, and bugs always tend to appear during the lifecycle of the software. If you want to send me a private message, feel free- I can give you my word I won't steal your idea. I've got a long list of projects of my own on the to-do list, though it is pretty tough to work on development projects in my spare time when I'm already developing all day every day at work."
TwinCities,35y39b,nekurashinen,4,Thu May 14 20:44:36 2015 UTC,"Some constructive criticism: Your pitch here is so common that it is a running joke in the programming subreddits here.  Basically tons of people fancy themselves ""the idea man"" and are looking for a programmer which essentially does all the real work.  What do you bring to the table? Just the idea?  You can't afford or are unwilling to invest real money in your idea so far... what type of assurance that you'll put much into it at all?  There are thousands of apps that come into the marketplace all the time. You need A LOT of work to make it in that marketplace.   My advice is to use this idea of yours to push yourself to get into programming. Take a class, work through a free online class/camp, subscribe to all the programming subs and learn.  Maybe eventually you'll be able to make your idea come true on your own or end up getting to know a lot of coders in the process that would love to pitch in."

I also don't know what it should cost and haven't heard much about  pricing. I read 50,000$ some places and 4,000$ at other places. I am not opposed to paying either but I really don't know what to pay."
TwinCities,35y39b,rkcr,1 point,Thu May 14 19:21:30 2015 UTC,One more thing. I really appreciate your response. I thought it was well written and you articulated your idea very well. It really has me thinking of how I can be more of a part of the process then just an idea guy with no money.
TwinCities,35y39b,rkcr,2,Thu May 14 19:28:34 2015 UTC,"I've been in exactly your same shoes. Though I have an extensive web design background, I failed quite spectacularly back in the Java class days when I was going for a Computer Science degree. Programming was just not my thing.  Markup languages though?  no problem!   Anyways, years ago I (and probably thousands of other people) had the idea for Yelp before there was even a Yelp.  Mine was called Karma, but it was basically the same thing -- an app that allowed customers to review places and if your place was good, good reviews were like good karma and people would come.... and vice versa for bad reviews.   Yeah, about 2 years later Yelp came out and fuck that shit.   I have two or three awesome new app ideas myself and last year I vowed never to have that Yelp thing happen to me again. So I started asking around the programmers I know of from my webdev world. Then I started asking around some of the students at UofM.  Of course I also hit Reddit but was weary to basically just come out and ask like you did because I, too, don't want someone to just run off with my idea.  After having no success in finding someone to build my idea for me I found out why... and such was what you are hearing here from many other people as well.  So... I am not letting that stop me. I started learning Javascript beyond the front-end stuff that I already knew and actually into the full programming stuff. Started by making my own games, actually, as a way to learn. The programming part is now finally ""clicking"" for me which it never did before so I am starting to get to a level where I can reasonably get a lot of what I want coded.  Its rough... and its not as native as straight Java for Android or Obj-C for Apple would be. But its a start.  Get that kind of start and you might also get some real programmers to get excited about the project.  TL;DR:  you are basically me last year"
TwinCities,35y39b,_blackbird,1 point,Thu May 14 21:36:51 2015 UTC,"also... if programming is not your thing at all, you could devote that same type of work into learning the business side of having an app... fund raising so that you can pay a developer, marketing so that you can sell the thing (even before its made, for more funding!), the legalese of how you would divide profits, ownership, rights, etc. with your developer and other staff should yet get more.  All that fun stuff.   Sure, sometimes a cool app just shows up and goes viral and surprises the hell out of everyone with its success... but WAY more often than not, even a generous definition of success in the app world is really hard fought on the business end."

If the city of Saint Paul were collaborating with MnDOT by putting in fiber whenever we did projects like this, we'd reduce the cost of building a citywide fiber network by more than 80%!  When I spoke with the MnDOT project manager for the Hwy 51/Snelling ave construction, she told me that the city of St. Paul would have to reach out to MnDOT in order for any fiber to be laid underneath.  Sadly the St. Paul city council is not taking advantage of these opportunities thus far."
TwinCities,35vo8w,saintpaulfiberfan,1 point,Thu May 14 04:52:45 2015 UTC,"While I support the idea of laying more fiber and Dig Once workflows, I dunno if putting infrastructure under an interstate is such a good idea.

TwinCities,35vo8w,Kichigai,2,Thu May 14 20:20:56 2015 UTC,"I think there might be some dark fiber laid near some of our highways and freeways, but not necessarily underneath exactly.  I was focused on the Snelling Ave work.  It's easier to place fiber conduit underneath the sidewalks where it's easier to access when installing fiber at individual homes.  MnDOT won't be doing that for this project based on what they told me.  The existing public fiber assets in St. Paul are mainly for traffic signals, though there could be some extra capacity that could used for a broadband fiber network."
TwinCities,35vo8w,saintpaulfiberfan,-1,Thu May 14 20:52:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, what would St Paul do with better internet access?"
TwinCities,35vo8w,thirdstreetzero,0,Thu May 14 13:21:57 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of things we could do with affordable, reliable and high-speed fiber internet access.  It's something all businesses can take advantage of to be more productive whether it be backing up to the cloud or otherwise.  Plus a fiber network could attract new businesses to St. Paul that otherwise would not even consider locating here.  Plus it would put the city in a position where we can ensure everyone has affordable wired internet access.  Right now 22% of households in town don't have any internet in the home.  In an age where our country is transitioning to an information based economy, leaving anyone disconnected and in the dark doesn't make sense."
TwinCities,35vo8w,saintpaulfiberfan,2,Thu May 14 14:59:12 2015 UTC,"It's something all businesses can take advantage of to be more productive whether it be backing up to the cloud or otherwise   True that. I work for a video production company that often works with clients from out-of-state, including broadcast TV. For the longest time best we could do was 20/20, which meant the only realistic way to deliver media to these clients was on tape, which costs us $94.65 to $126.95 for delivering a one hour show (90+ minute tapes are over the $200 mark), and around $100 for a next-day FedEx. Now we usually have to deliver multiple tapes, as each department needs a copy (web, promotions, broadcast, archive, and international). So that's nearly $1,000 just for delivery, and it takes about a day to make all the tapes, assuming everything goes right.  And then if we find out something has gone wrong and we need to redeliver the whole thing it means we need 36 hours notice (one day to make the tape, the rest for delivery time), and at that point we're likely paying a courier to run it out there faster than FedEx.  We were supposed to get 100MbPS fiber brought into the building this past January, and that still hasn't happened."

It's not so bad if you know what you're doing, it's just time consuming. Recently we complained to our ISP about them not delivering what we promised (we paid a ton of money to have them bring in the fiber) so they kajiggered up a 75MbPS temporary setup which is reasonable enough for digital delivery of 80GB files.   You experience reminds me of one I read about in Texas where a former engineering professor who started his own CAD design company has to send hard drives with his files in the mail because the internet in College Station Texas is incredibly slow.   We've done that too. Sometimes it's because the client doesn't have enough bandwidth to do digital (they're not all media companies), sometimes it's just because neither of us have the software infrastructure to do it efficiently (you need something like Aspera Faspex or Signiant Media Shuttle, which are trés pricey, to avoid the slow down over distance experience by TCP packets).

Once we produced a two hour special for one client, and we followed their specs to the letter, and they're loving the show. Then we ship 'em off a tape, and two days later we get a note from them saying the show is sailing right through QC.  Two days after that they tell us that the show is unacceptable because our graphics intrude on their bug. We say, ""no it isn't,"" and we look at the specs, where there is absolutely nothing about a bug. Then they shoot us back a screen shot of their software, and lo and behold, their bug is right on top of one of our graphics. This is a Friday and the show airs on Sunday. Rightfully the entire company is pissed about this, even the people who have nothing to do with any of this. There's nothing in the specs about a bug, the graphics have been in the show for weeks (the never said a word), and they've had the tape for several days and they're just now telling us about this?  So we go back in and move all the graphics to fit where they're telling us the bug is. And then we make more tapes and we hire a courier to run these out to LA, ASAP. I think I was in the office for like thirteen hours that day.  The show aired on Sunday with a Twitter crawl (which we knew was going to happen) on the top of the screen (we shot everything expecting it was going to be on the bottom) but at least their bug didn't cover any of our graphics.  The next week my boss gives me the scuttlebutt on what happened: turns out the client never QC'd the damn tape until the day they found out about the bug. This was a big cable channel, too. They were the sloppiest client we ever had to deal with.  The whole epic is recounted here, along with all the other bullshit we had to deal with for that delivery.

They are thus a form of permanent visual station identification, increasing brand recognition and asserting ownership of the video signal.

Thankfully Dakota County has been making these investments for quite some time now.  Their plan is to lease out the dark fiber network to private providers down the road from what I remember them telling me.  So there should be lots of competition for affordable service I would assume.
TwinCities,35vo8w,saintpaulfiberfan,0,Fri May 15 04:04:21 2015 UTC,"the Pennfield apartments   You have to keep in mind that investing in downtown residential is probably the best way to generate tax revenue for the city.  In a dense residential environment, a 7 story residential building on 3/4 of an acre can generate $700,000 in annual tax revenue for the city. With 1/8 acre lots, you would need to develop 21 acres of land to generate the same tax revenue. With 1/4 acre lots, you would need 43 acres of land.   The economics of cities are quite simple. Dense is more sustainable and a better investment. That's why Saint Paul is investing so heavily in downtown. Investments in downtown generate tax revenue more than investments elsewhere."
TwinCities,35vo8w,solla_bolla,2,Thu May 14 19:22:12 2015 UTC,"I disagree that localized real estate investments are the best way to spend tax dollars.  Look the leadership of St. Paul knows our downtown doesn't get as much business as downtown Minneapolis.  The Pennfield apartments are a way for the city to try and attract higher income residents back.  There was also a Lunds built nearby as well.  The goal was to spur outside development dollars businesses back to downtown St. Paul.   Also remember the mayor said, ""St. Paul is back, folks"".  http://www.startribune.com/st-paul-officials-finally-cut-the-ribbon-for-penfield-apartment-project/244072061/  It's a better use of public money, in my opinion, to spend money on a project like a citywide fiber network that impacts the whole town and not just a small area around the Pennfield apartments."

More than 3.5 million tons of plastic bags, sacks and wraps were discarded in 2008.   That's a lot of extra trash in the landfills. Likely enough to fill a landfill or two.  Here are a few plastic bag facts. Seems like enough issues to be a problem and that doesn't even account for all the extra pollution and energy used to make them and transport them.   Over 1 trillion plastic bags are used every year worldwide. Consider China, a country of 1.3 billion, which consumes 3 billion plastic bags daily, according to China Trade News. About 1 million plastic bags are used every minute. A single plastic bag can take up to 1,000 years to degrade. More than 3.5 million tons of plastic bags, sacks and wraps were discarded in 2008. Only 1 in 200 plastic bags in the UK are recycled (BBC). The U.S. goes through 100 billion single-use plastic bags. This costs retailers about $4 billion a year. Plastic bags are the second-most common type of ocean refuse, after cigarette butts (2008) Plastic bags remain toxic even after they break down. Every square mile of ocean has about 46,000 pieces of plastic floating in it.   http://blog.epa.gov/bigbluethread/2014/03/where-do-plastic-bags-go/  http://www.reuseit.com/facts-and-myths/learn-more-facts-about-the-plastic-bag-pandemic.htm"

I advise people who are curious to listen to the Skeptoid podcast which addresses this issue.   non-woven polypropylene bags needed to be re-used at least 11 times to have lower global warming potential than single-use HPDE, or High-Density Poly-Ethylene, bags. Cotton shopping bags need to be used at least 131 times. Paper bags were the big losers. They aren't likely to survive the 4 uses needed to reach the same global warming potential, but are much more toxic to produce than plastic."

TwinCities,35r0ou,Kichigai,2,Wed May 13 18:07:40 2015 UTC,"True on your first two points, I can't figure out what you meant in the third.  If we were to commit to recycling, HDPE is an outstanding plastic, and grocery bags are food-grade, which is higher quality than most."
TwinCities,35r0ou,Fulcro,2,Wed May 13 20:20:28 2015 UTC,"I misread your source and misphrased my argument as a result. What I had meant was that the cotton bags are more likely to survive the 131 uses necessary to have a lower global warming potential than HDPE bags.  I mean, if you go grocery shopping once a week that's about two and a half years to hit that point, and we've got plenty of bags in our house older than that. And that only assumes you use it for shopping, and not for other duties (like taking something to someone else's house, or using it to carry a bunch of stuff from one place in the house to another, or something like that).  HDPE is a fine plastic, indeed (it's certainly more easily recycled than ABS, for most people), but just because it's made of a recyclable material doesn't necessarily justify the use of disposable grocery bags, it just means perhaps we should consider making our multiple use bags out of HDPE instead of cotton."
TwinCities,35r0ou,Kichigai,1 point,Wed May 13 20:32:56 2015 UTC,"Very interesting point. I don't know of any polyethylene multi-use bags, but I suspect that they would be woven, vs. the vinyl bags that resemble oilcloth. I think nylon or polyester is more common for that application.  Regarding cotton, I have to commend you, we use non-disposable bags as much as we can, but I'm not sure we get the token 131 uses out of the few cotton bags we have.  Speaking for myself, I only let my merchandise be bagged if I can't carry it otherwise. I was a Courtesy Clerk (grocery store bag boy) around '89-'90 when people first started acting on the common wisdom based solely on biodegradability. I remember a customer who would ask to not have her groceries bagged at all. We thought she was a lunatic, but as it turns out, she was way ahead of her time."

TwinCities,35r0ou,Fulcro,0,Wed May 13 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"I found several articles in just a minute on Google talking about how lithium batteries cost 5 times as much to recycle as they do to manufacture. Also, most people don't consider where the power comes from to charge those plug in cars. Chances are, if you're in America, it's from a coal plant. Burning coal to create that electricity offsets any environmental gains of not having emissions. Most people think that in order to maintain production, car makers are going to have to start recycling the batteries themselves near the car factories. These are all in heavily coal powered areas.  If they just scrap the old ones and get new, where do they go? Nobody wants to recycle them because it's not worth the cost.   Now let's add in all the diesel for shipping lithium from south America to Japan for manufacturing batteries, then back to the U.S. to be put into cars.   Plain and simple, batteries are bad for mother earth. We all know we're killing the planet simply by existing, so it's really about minimizing our impact. Batteries have much higher impact than an old beater that gets 40+ mpg."

TwinCities,35s6yb,Mamertine,2,Mon May 18 01:19:55 2015 UTC,"Hopefully you see this: I 100% agree with people about taking the light rail and bus, but depending on where you're going I'd recommend getting off at the 38th street station and taking the 23 bus to Uptown rather than getting off at Lake and taking the 21 bus. The 21 can be terribly slow and not very pleasant, whereas the 23 is pretty chill. The only caveat is that the 23 runs on a limited schedule (every half hour, I think?), so make sure to check out the metro transit website to see if you'd have to wait too long for it."
TwinCities,35s6yb,cbizz23,1 point,Wed May 13 16:39:00 2015 UTC,"use ""metrotransit.org"" and the 'trip planner'. you can put in the date, time, whether you arrive by or depart by. select common locations (airport), physical address- wherever you're going- and if you want minimal walking distance. They don't directly have an app. I talked to a web developer there about why.

TwinCities,35ohbx,mustacheriot,27,Tue May 12 05:24:05 2015 UTC,"Think about it this way... That's roughly 180 miles per day, 900 per week, or about 47k per year. If you get 30mpg that's 1560 gallons of fuel and if you average say $2.50 per gallon that's $3900 just in fuel. If you go 5k miles between oil changes that's 10 oil changes at what, $40 a pop if you go to like Valvoline or $20 if you do it yourself? Now consider the fact you're going to burn through a set of cheap tires per year or an expensive set every 18-24 months, and all the other wear parts on the car. Now redo all that for a more modest commute. I wouldn't doubt the net expense of driving that much is going to cost you an extra $5000-$7000 a year or more. Last thing: 3 hours a day for 5 days 50 weeks a year is 750 hours or 31.25 days you'll spend in the car during the next year. Only you can decide what your time is worth and if the balance between salary, commute time, and commute cost makes sense but honestly I think you'd have to be off your rocker a bit to go through with that."

Plus think about the months Nov - Mar, where it could snow anywhere from 1"", making the roads icy, to 18"", making some roads impassible.

If I can get work done on the bus, I don't see a big difference between spending time at my desk or on the bus. The cost of the bus would be just under $4,000. This is steep but I just moved to the TCs two years ago and it only just feels like I live here. Just found good friends, now I finally know the places I like etc. I don't want to have to (pretty much) give this up only to move a 1.5 hours away, you know?  It could be worth it, I think.

Commuting daily would be a nightmare for me.  Yeah you don't get to keep interacting with friends in the same way but if they're good friends they'll see you when you can get back up there.  I don't know what you're moving down to Roch for but the buses are very scheduled and if you can't be super consistent that would cause some worry if I were you."

TwinCities,35ohbx,D_Wal,2,Tue May 12 19:09:24 2015 UTC,"I took the RCL commuter bus from Bloomington to Rochester for a temporary job. With the subsidized monthly pass, it was cheaper than driving and I mostly just slept the entire ride to and from work. Winter didn't have much of an effect. Probably wouldn't do it permanently, but it wasn't as bad as people here seem to think."
TwinCities,35ohbx,D_Wal,0,Tue May 12 22:19:18 2015 UTC,"Word. Thanks.This is the impression I get from most real life people I talk to. Reddit seems to diverge from this dramatically. I wouldn't want to do it permanently either, I think, although I guess it's worth noting that most people on the coasts or in more major cities, this kind of commute is typical.  Did you feel like you had time for yourself or did it not seem to cut into things very much?"
TwinCities,35ohbx,candycaneforestelf,1 point,Wed May 13 02:30:08 2015 UTC,"The commute obviously takes time. Count on it being at least 4 hours a day, depending on how far you need to drive to it. That's a lot, but I figure I spent about 3 hours of that sleeping.  My situation was odd in that I was taking a full course load for graduate school in Minneapolis while working four days a week in Rochester. So I had time for my classes and homework, but not for much else.  If the choice is between the bus and driving, I'd choose the bus. The bus is fairly popular, especially in the winter when people give up on their cars. When I took the bus, Mayo paid for 30% of the cost for the monthly pass.  You could always try the bus for a bit, and if it's not working for you, you could look for rooms to rent in Rochester or something."
TwinCities,35ohbx,Sharcbait,2,Wed May 13 23:17:20 2015 UTC,"The question with the bus is, will Mayo let you spend some of your scheduled office time on that bus?"
TwinCities,35ohbx,efranz91,7,Wed May 13 00:13:05 2015 UTC,"moved down a few months ago. the people here are generally pretty nice, with the exception of taxi drivers. fuck them so hard, honk at the pedestrian when they are taking illegal left turns. if you move in near downtown, there will be several bars for you to go to if that is your scene. The drive becomes a drag, espically at night if you are heading home in the dark. And its only 3 hour round trip, so you can visit the cities often if you want, and its not THAT huge of a deal to have somebody come visit you. so the question is, are you willing to work an 11 hour day everyday for 8 hours of pay as the price to not have to uproot your life. also if you are getting a job offer from Mayo, they usually give a relocation compensation if you move."

TwinCities,35ohbx,vinney1369,1 point,Wed May 13 02:27:39 2015 UTC,"Even the bus is slow in snow and ice. The bus does not levitate or magically avoid weather and road construction. You'll need to get from where you're living to the bus, which I seem to recall runs from near MOA. So the bus commute time isn't the whole of it, and I am assuming an 8.5 hour work day (lunch) as a professional, because there is no way someone in a low-skill gig looks at this kind of commute.   The 7am is the last outbound bus, versus the 6 and the 5, so missing the 7AM bus leaves you in a bit of a pinch. The last bus back is at 5:15. So to work a full day, especially if the AM bus has a habit of not being on time, I don't see how you get up at 6 and get home at 6, realistically. No snark, just schedule."
TwinCities,35ohbx,greenstar15,5,Wed May 13 12:06:02 2015 UTC,"I work out of 25 different offices for the company I work for but one of our locations is Rochester and I have to make the 160+ mile commute (I live in the south metro of the twin cities) two to four times a month sometimes more.  It's not a bad drive if the roads are dry but the last time I went (late February) it was pretty snowy with a rougher than usual ride (the roads hadn't been cleared the greatest) - well, long story short it turns out I had to buy two new tires (the wear and tear on the car gets a little much).  If I had to do it more frequently I probably would seek other avenues but luckily I only have to do it a couple times a month at most.  For some reason the drive down isn't so bad but that drive on the way back up kind of wears on you after a while especially in the winter when you're driving back in the dark.  Maybe because I have an hour and a half drive to look forward to while all of my family and friends are already either eating dinner or doing things since their commute is 10-15 minutes from home.  The other thought is - year round on the way down you've got the sun shining on you on the drivers side of the car and on the back way up it's the drivers side again as the sun goes down.  Invest in sunglasses or tinted windows for sure.  It's not terrible, I just wouldn't want to do it every day.  Maybe if they ever get high speed rail going between here and there that would be more viable than driving.  The shortest possible route for me is to take 52 most of the way and then cut across Apple Valley from Rosemount to get home quickest but if you're coming from Minneapolis it's going to add 20 some miles making it a close to 200 mile round trip."
TwinCities,35ohbx,D_Wal,9,Tue May 12 12:59:40 2015 UTC,Well I suppose it depends on if you want to drive 3 hours there and back every day for work or if you want to spend 3 hours driving there and back everything you want to see your friends
