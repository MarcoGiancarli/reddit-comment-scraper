Heroclix,3e5zce,JesXe,2,Wed Jul 22 05:48:58 2015 UTC,This right here.  Dollar value is always a major factor in any trade for me.
Heroclix,3e5zce,gloryglory31,3,Wed Jul 22 13:30:58 2015 UTC,Checking Ebay for recently sold auctions is a good way to determine value and would take less time to check than it probably took to write this post.  Cheers.  Thor  Iron Man
Heroclix,3e5zce,Cactusman008,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:43:11 2015 UTC,"I'd go by the ""Buy it Nows"" and not the auctions.  Or just price compare on coolstuffinc and trollandtoad.  Their prices usually show any actual differences."
Heroclix,3e5zce,Disasstah,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:04:29 2015 UTC,"Buy it nows is what people want to get for the piece, not what it is worth, as it doesn't show if people are buying it. By looking at the auction price, you can get an average of what is currently being spent for the piece.   Troll and Toad is usually good at showing the price difference though, maybe not the going rate, but the price difference."
Heroclix,3e5zce,raymondanderson,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:31:18 2015 UTC,"I must say, the Thor is worth more, Ive seen more Iron Man pulled then Thor. I go to two venues to play heroclix and out of 20 people, all who all bought cases. Only 1 pulled a Thor wile the rest of us got Iron Man, Cap and the other Super Rares. we even had more players pull the prime then we did Thors."
Heroclix,3e5zce,RDG4ME2,2,Wed Jul 22 07:09:08 2015 UTC,"Me, I always use eBay and Troll & Toad as measuring sticks when pricing figs. I also use pull experience, and I'll second/third/fourth/nth the observation about how rare pulling Thor was. We got three cases for our store, and we got two Caps, two Iron Men, three chases (King Thor being one of them), two Ragnaroks, and no Thor. I asked around our community, and only found three people pulling Thors (and we acquired one from one of the three). We all had better luck pulling Ragnarok, even pulling Rick Jones and King Thor. So I'd say, Thor is more valuable then Iron Man."
Heroclix,3e5zce,juncruznaligas,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:05:26 2015 UTC,"""Everything is worth what its purchaser will pay for it.""  There are other factors to consider in the value of a figure besides its rariety. Gameplay value is a big one. I'm not familiar with either of the figures because I only collect DC, but I'm sure one is worth more than the other."
Heroclix,3e5zce,rosinthebow,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:15:00 2015 UTC,The reason I was told he is much more rarer is because of having a sr prime on his slot to. So when you pull Rangnarok it goes in place of a Thor. Again this is what people at my venue have said.
Heroclix,3e5zce,sdcg81,-1,Wed Jul 22 12:34:37 2015 UTC,Imo most clicks of the same rarity should hold the same value in a trade but ridiculous prices on ebay over inflate the value of an oz of plastic. If I were the guy with the Ironman I'd say sell your thor on ebay then.
Heroclix,3e5zce,teo1315,3,Wed Jul 22 06:20:49 2015 UTC,"It makes sense though. Certain skulpts are more collectable, certain dials way more competitive/useful, and some are more rare than simply what category they belong to.  I would imagine Thor is slightly rarer than other super rares due to the prime. That may not be the case but I know ive seen way more Immortus, red wolf, and Ronin's pulled than most other super rares. Theres nothing wrong with those figs, some are damn good, but they are more plentiful and therefore worth less."

Personally I don't like despotellis that much, I only faced him twice, but he's played with the legion of superheroes ring so he can share its defense with teammates. he has only 3 clicks so someone with an attack of 11-12 (add here PC or perplex and makes it easier to take him down), so if you can protect him it's ok, but I don't like it that much.

Heroclix,3dzuiq,Crundlegush,2,Mon Jul 20 21:36:32 2015 UTC,You actually get one or the other. 1 resource or 1 relic. Although most resources give out relics or some other form of object/game element (ie. Constructs).

You may include one resource on your  force and must pay any associated costs for  including them in your force. The effects of each  resource are defined on the resource’s instruction  card.     When you include a resource on your force, you  may not include any special objects on your force  Hope this helps.  Link to the core rulebook just in case you don't have one!"

Depending on points, one could theoretically include all seven sins, all seven relics plus a relic/resource, though you would need another seven models to assign the sin relics to. Not very likely to have that many points ever, but i believe it is possible."

If you assign the phoenix force to just one character you only need one KO (aim for support pieces) or to get doubles.  It makes it a little more controllable at least. It certainly helps that the sentinel has a base 12 attack and a perplexer around to make that first hit stick."

Heroclix,3dzc22,FrustrationSensation,5,Mon Jul 20 19:25:54 2015 UTC,"Green Lanterns are the only corps that have a fully-functioning team ability. When they carry they can carry all qualifying characters adjacent to them.   Now the green, black, and white lanterns have Alternate Team Abilities (ATAs) that are based off of their keywords. You can pay the points for an ata when you use a theme team. You pay the cost for each character that has the qualifying keyword.  For example, Black Hand and Black Lantern Aquaman make a BL theme team because they are both BL. You can then pay the cost of the ata for both of them to ""give"" them a team ability. These atas will tell you whether or not they can be copied by wildcards.  All of the other corps currently don't have an ATA that will give them a makeshift team ability. However, each corps is given a significant stat boost when using their respective Power Battery."

That isn't so easy these days, especially with some of the more 'in demand' ones.  Also worth nothing that, personally, with a few exceptions, I don't find running the battery with the matching team particularly rewarding, largely finding the +1s less impressive than the power-related benefit non-members get.

You will need to slightly and carefully heat (boiling works best for me) the figures, just enough to loosen the plastic. You can then wiggle and pry them out. Just be careful doing this. 2) Say screw it and just pry them off. They will often break if you don't heat them up, but its simpler.  When they made these things, most people had this issue as well. Because most people will not use the fragments without the resource, they often opt out to just pry the stuff off without care for the base."

It did not work out that well for me. 50 point starting line was a big mistake. MODAM got hit hard for 5 or 6 damage every game on the first attack and things just got out of hand quickly in every game.

What this would have given you is the possibility of a pretty nice pulse wave from Hank Pym, with the perplex from Yellowjacket, and the 3 person theme team for a potential prob.  Iron Man brings an outwit, maybe some super strength shenanigans. You can potentially avoid pushing on Yellowjacket/Hank Pym by switching into the Ant-Man you got.  It also kind of forces people to focus on Iron Man if they aren't a melee focused team, as it would make Hank Pym a 20 defense, Yellowjacket can morph into Ant-Man and get stealth.

Heroclix,3dnarw,redgears,5,Fri Jul 17 17:39:06 2015 UTC,Exactly why I despise playing against the green battery.
Heroclix,3dnarw,jaguarphd,5,Fri Jul 17 19:30:47 2015 UTC,"GPB, and White Witch before it were counters to a very specific meta that had become dominant.  The year of Ghost Rider/Heroes for Hire/Team Bases was all about MASSIVE Free action swarming.  This gave those tactics a hard counter.  It never stops you from playing, but it does drastically cut back on your options.  Say you've got a running shot ranged attacker with perplex.  Do you use the perplex and be restricted to a turret role, or do you running shot without modifiers.  Orange Power Battery is kind of related.  While I was AMAZED when I found out that 'Improved Movement' counted as a single thing, other than that, generally it at least requires somewhat strategic play from the user.  Now, once the constructs are out, on the right team, can an orange battery team relatively consistently take away the opponent's BEST option?  Yes.  But it never makes them unable to actually play the game.  I can really only think of 4 'F you for playing the game, asshole' things in the history of Clix.  Future Foundation Reed Richards, who gave an action token/unavoidable damage to anyone who dealt two damage or more (you can't play around that, your guys either do 2 or more damage or they don't), Bombastic Bag Man (who returned all damage he took as unavoidable to his attacker), Faust, and, to a lesser extent than all of the above, Strange.  There is a BIG difference between Faust's 'You can only do this' and the Power Battery(s) 'You can't do THAT.'  Edit: Looking at the article, I would compare the Power Batteries to their 'Narrower Scope' example.  Or dealing with a Blue Deck in Magic the Gathering.  Faust is much more a 'Callous Guards' situation.  Of course, even without Faust, the thing that made the Book of Gluttony so effective was that, while it didn't really restrict your opponent's actions, it kind of meant that their actions weren't actually going to matter.  If you can't actually make a lasting impact on your opponent's team, you're going to lose.  Period.  Chewing through 4 clicks of 'one click at a time' damage, with Regen on the 4th click is going to really screw most 300 point teams.  Though, as has been pointed out in my store, the GCPD actually dealt with it fairly well, but kinda falls apart to the other META teams."
Heroclix,3dnarw,aradraugfea,6,Sat Jul 18 00:37:59 2015 UTC,"A lot of people hate the GPB.  I don't.  Sure it makes things difficult, and a lot more strategic, but it doesn't stop game play.  Also gives you a reason to target a battery.  This sounds like inhibitors like Faust, and to a much less extent, Strange.  You can throw in things like the orange power battery, too, but that's a bit different than the previous two and more like the GPB.  While I feel the OPB is overpowered right now (negating all improved movement should be errata'd), it's not game breaking."
Heroclix,3dnarw,Bentley82,6,Fri Jul 17 19:37:56 2015 UTC,"Faust is definitely the better example. The green power battery is kind of a halfway point - it makes some characters virtually unplayable (Super Skrull, Engineer, Batman), and makes plenty of characters just unable to use their powers. You can build with it in mind, but in general it just takes a fair amount of pieces and makes me think oh, I don't want to play this because it's useless if my opponent has a green battery.  The thing to keep in mind is that the green battery isn't something your opponent has to do, but it's just a global effect they can invoke for 16 points that impedes gameplay in a way that nothing else other than faust can. And with faust, you at least have to hit a roll."
Heroclix,3dnarw,jaguarphd,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:54:54 2015 UTC,"I agree.  My favorite character to play is the chase Question from Flash.  He can make like 4 free actions in a turn (sidestep, outwit, charge, and barrier), so a GPB definitely shuts him down.  But it doesn't completely shut down a team.  Same with OPB.  In my recent ROC tournament, I played against one (and one the night before) and cancelling all improved movement is absurd.  I view them as four different powers.  Maybe if you cancel out flight which would do that, but I had a colossal and flight.  I shouldn't lose all IM just because you can choose all IM."
Heroclix,3dnarw,Bentley82,3,Fri Jul 17 20:00:02 2015 UTC,"I agree. That whole shriek,  orange battery, moon team was almost as bad as faust imo."
Heroclix,3dnarw,Stickfigure91x,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:27:22 2015 UTC,"Haven't played that shriek team, so not sure.  I played one with OPB and one with RPB.  Neither were necessarily game breaking, but idk about other versions.  Now Banshee, FF Atomica, and Scarlet Witch LE, all possessed with OPB is bad, but less so for shutting down a team and more for ""I need a 12 to hit everytime?  Fuck this."""
Heroclix,3dnarw,Bentley82,3,Fri Jul 17 21:38:04 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/VQP12p5.png  That team is quite possibly one of the most toxic combinations in modern, with the exception of lucky faust combos.  Engineer can pick any non defensive power, and then shut it off with the orange power battery every turn, all while having an engineer who can pick precision strike, prob, charge, and exploit from scissors in order to penetrate all 3 defensive d6 mechanics, and able to pulse wave to avoid invincible, or have shriek turn it off from parallax if necessary, while shriek can mind control through walls at 10 range.  The basic idea is that the only way to actually attack shriek or engineer is to charge them, because they have plasticity, and shrieks special power makes it so you can't make ranged attacks within 10 range of her.  Essentially, if you don't have a way to somehow outwit her power through quintessence, or a way to place yourself in her range like double sidestep + tk into adjacency, you can't attack either piece on his team without just using a move action to go up to one of the pieces, and then the next turn, Shriek can pick hypersonic speed from parallax, and breakaway on a 2 even if you have plasticity., and attack you, then move away. Basically making it so you can never attack shriek. Engineer can also pick hypersonic speed and do the same thing.  Basically you have two solid attackers, and it's extremely rare that an attacker will ever be able to roll an attack on you."
Heroclix,3dnarw,Temil,5,Sat Jul 18 22:07:10 2015 UTC,"Also gives you a reason to target a battery.   This would be reasonable if your entire team were 12 movement 5 damage top dial characters that could dismantle the battery in a mere 4-5 turns.  But alas, most competitive teams are relegated to doing 1-2 damage per swing on a battery, and even then, that's only really ""reliable"" once the battery is off of it's top dial 19 defense click.  If a green battery player really wanted to protect his battery, he could sit back, apply 1 construct every two turns, not ever pushing off of click 1, and force you to deal 1-2 damage per turn to their battery, while they are able to freely attack your force.  In a competitive game, attacking the battery is never an option. (outside of weird highfather games where it's despotellis doing 0 damage to invincible pieces, and the battery is on click 20 or something (This happened to me at roc state championships in top 16))  Honestly, the problem I have with the green battery, as apposed to any other resource in the game, is that there is no real way to slow it down or stop it. You can't even make free actions during the first turn, because it doesn't require any constructs to be on a friendly corps member.  I think the BIGGEST problem with the green power battery is that it isn't situational at all. Where as something like the Phoenix Force is a bit weaker when there is only one character on the opposing force, or if the enemy has multiple figures, the black power battery isn't as effective (because it's rare you will be lower point than one of his figures.) But the green battery is always good, always reliable.  Sometimes I feel like ""At the beginning of your turn, deal 1 damage to each opposing character for each action token they have"" would be less game breaking than it's current emotional spectrum."
Heroclix,3dnarw,Temil,2,Fri Jul 17 22:02:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree it's not the best option, but it's always there.  In my experience, though, GPB has never been game breaking or totally team inhibiting for me.  It's playable.  Just may not be the most enjoyable, but most meta/300 point teams aren't that fun to play against."
Heroclix,3dncep,HouseDraagnaj,5,Fri Jul 17 17:51:23 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest picking up the recent Original Avengers Fast Forces and printing the rulebook and PAC.  Actual starters fly out of stores, especially when tied to popular movies."

Heroclix,3dncep,drivendreamer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:46:24 2015 UTC,"I think they are 1"".  Just big enough to fit the figures.    The starter comes with a lot of extra stuff.  Barrier/smoke/hindering tokens, heavy/light items, PAC, and rule book along with the 5-6 figures for each.  If you have no issues with not having any of those, or would rather print and play them yourself, my suggestion is to go on ebay and buy a CUR set (common, uncommon, rare) from whichever series you'd like the most.  This gives you usually 30-50 figures at typically $.25-$.50 a piece.  Best way to buy in bulk and build a quick, varied collection for cheap."
Heroclix,3dncep,DJdekutree,2,Fri Jul 17 23:22:54 2015 UTC,"You don't really need a starter. You need 2 6 sided die, a map, some tokens (or change) and some figures. You can print the rulebook and PAC. A brick is a great way to get a lot of a single set, buying a few boosters will probably be all you need to start. No guarantee your favorite characters will come in the boosters, but that makes it all the more rewarding when you finally pull that piece you wanted, especially if you don't have a lot of figs. Welcome to the game!"

Heroclix,3de7n0,rosinthebow,0,Sat Jul 18 05:18:28 2015 UTC,Where's the rest of the Agents of Shield? Skye? Simmons? Ward? Bill Paxton? Kyle McLachan?
Heroclix,3de7n0,JesXe,5,Wed Jul 15 17:30:06 2015 UTC,"There's 2 more characters in the FF, they'll probably preview those Friday."
Heroclix,3de7n0,redgears,2,Wed Jul 15 18:24:19 2015 UTC,"3 more, I think. Simmons, Skye and Nick Fury"
Heroclix,3de7n0,JesXe,4,Wed Jul 15 19:05:19 2015 UTC,"-The Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. work behind the scenes to keep the world safe from Hydra and other threats. Led by Nick Fury and Phil Coulson this crack squad of agents include Agents May, Fitz, Simmons and the master-hacker-turned-agent Skye!     Just checked the solicit, you are correct"
Heroclix,3de7n0,rph39,2,Wed Jul 15 19:13:13 2015 UTC,I would imagine they're probably just not in the fast forces and are in boosters
Heroclix,3de7n0,dusktilhon,5,Wed Jul 15 17:39:03 2015 UTC,They're in the FF.  There was an image of the FF pack spoiled at Origins
Heroclix,3de7n0,rph39,2,Wed Jul 15 18:55:40 2015 UTC,Oh sweet! I'll have to look that up!
Heroclix,3de7n0,Dont_be_an_idot,4,Wed Jul 15 18:56:51 2015 UTC,"We will likely get 2 versons of each character. One fast forces, one booster verson."
Heroclix,3dec62,respite,2,Wed Jul 15 16:38:36 2015 UTC,Im sure they're just swamped from SDCC. They will reply soon im sure.
Heroclix,3debmk,Bentley82,4,Wed Jul 15 16:34:56 2015 UTC,"It's set up like AoU, Wave 1 had the odds, Wave 2 has the evens"
Heroclix,3debmk,JesXe,-2,Wed Jul 15 16:59:05 2015 UTC,an answer like this could be answered by checking out the unit section over at hcrealms. super handy.  edit: dunno why i got downvoted. the question could have been answered easily if OP had checked.
Heroclix,3debmk,dr_nerdface,4,Wed Jul 15 16:54:14 2015 UTC,Pretty sure you are being down voted because units don't say what is wave 1 and wave 2.
Heroclix,3debmk,petsandtrees,4,Wed Jul 15 18:17:00 2015 UTC,I can't find it anywhere personally.
Heroclix,3debmk,MicSoundersXIII,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:27:56 2015 UTC,Someone already said Wave 1 is odds and Wave 2 is evens.
Heroclix,3deqnm,cobrafett,2,Wed Jul 15 18:19:46 2015 UTC,They get to choose whichever option they want.  Happens all the time when I use Hulk.  Instead of giving me a rage token they just have their character take an unavoidable and an action token because I just KO'd their piece.
Heroclix,3deqnm,Disasstah,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:48:50 2015 UTC,"Gotta have that Nick Fury, even if just for a situation like this."
Heroclix,3deqnm,Guyonbench,0,Thu Jul 16 08:43:57 2015 UTC,Yup.  Only problem is that you can't run him and Jarvis at the same time.
Heroclix,3deqnm,dusktilhon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:37:50 2015 UTC,Why not? And I guess the OP edited his post? I don't see anything about Jarvis.
Heroclix,3deqnm,Guyonbench,0,Sat Jul 18 14:17:34 2015 UTC,"Nick Fury has to be the lowest point cost on your team for his Outwit/Leadership trait to activate.  So you can run him, he's just not as effective.    And OP didn't bring Jarvis up, I was just sayin'."
Heroclix,3deqnm,dusktilhon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:42:19 2015 UTC,Still not sure where your random Jarvis plug comes from. Or your point about Nick Furys trait. OPs question was about people picking the inapplicable half of the Avengers Assemble trait and I gave a way to counter that.
Heroclix,3deqnm,Guyonbench,0,Sat Jul 18 15:06:18 2015 UTC,"So the way it's worded is they choose when you hit, then the unavoidable damage part takes place after actions resolve. There's not actually ""only one option remaining"" since they choose before that."
Heroclix,3deqnm,coldnuglyside,3,Wed Jul 15 18:54:15 2015 UTC,so you roll - hit - they choose trait - normal damage is dealt -  then trait kicks in..?
Heroclix,3deqnm,coldnuglyside,3,Wed Jul 15 20:47:44 2015 UTC,"Correct. Action tokens are assigned ""after actions resolve"" as well which is why both options for the trait happen last."
Heroclix,3deqnm,akujiki87,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:07:48 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure hit,   choose,  trait,  damage."
Heroclix,3deqnm,coldnuglyside,2,Wed Jul 15 20:59:51 2015 UTC,"Damage occurs during the action, so just switch the last two."
