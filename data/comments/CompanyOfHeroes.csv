CompanyOfHeroes,3e3h7n,Charismaztex,0,Wed Jul 22 01:58:55 2015 UTC,little pricey for medium armor?
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3h7n,COH-CIV-TW,11,Tue Jul 21 18:08:05 2015 UTC,"Medium? Believe me, Churchills are tough nuts to crack."
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3h7n,Bromao,3,Tue Jul 21 18:12:08 2015 UTC,I expect Churchills to have performance similar to the KV-1 so the price is what I'd expect.
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3h7n,GuardsmanWaffle,4,Tue Jul 21 18:17:10 2015 UTC,But the KV-1 is kinda bad isn't it?
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3h7n,erik4848,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:05 2015 UTC,the big difference as it appears is that the tank has 360 small arms defense via grenades or submachine guns from portholes? Sounds like its devastating vs infantry while having some ability to fight medium armor. + at vet 3 all Churchill appear to get free crit repairs when not in combat.  So if anything it makes the KV1 look more shitty but then again it costs more.
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3h7n,tipsy3000,2,Tue Jul 21 18:26:53 2015 UTC,It's supposed to be better then the KV-1. The KV-1 is a midgame heavy. The churchills are for the late game. Much beefier.
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3h7n,Omega_Warrior,0,Tue Jul 21 18:58:47 2015 UTC,KV1 really isnt meant to be the only armor on the field. Supported with a su85 its a beefy hit point sink.
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3h7n,internet-arbiter,3,Tue Jul 21 18:46:05 2015 UTC,The Churchill VII has an armor config of 152/85/50 (front/sides/rear) whereas the kv1 was 75/75/70 sometimes up armored to 100/75/70 through additional welded on plates.  Tiger was 100/80/80 for reference. I know this game doesn't really model armor perfectly (anything but front=glass) but the churchill definitely falls into the heavy category.
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3h7n,robber364,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:46:00 2015 UTC,There's actually side armor rating? From what I understand tanks only have front/rear armor depending where you hit them in the side.

CompanyOfHeroes,3e3bhi,relkin43,8,Tue Jul 21 20:06:17 2015 UTC,"Afrika corps had constant supply issues but lots of veterans.  They were also constantly on the move and received reinforcements and supplies from overseas.  Instead of traditional bases it'd be cool to see an army with mobile units that serve those functions and reinforcement wave timers for new units and replenishment.   This places a big emphasis on keeping units alive and economizing your resources efficiently while planning ahead.  It also allows you to be mobile by having your ""base"" just be a command tank or something that can motor around - high risk but also high reward.  Finally keeping units alive should be rewarded with the ability to upgrade units like giving them better tanks or gear over time."
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3bhi,TwatBrah,6,Tue Jul 21 19:16:25 2015 UTC,They also need 5 star Vet like the OKW. Could have an emphasis on fewer but more customizable units.
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3bhi,Charismaztex,5,Tue Jul 21 19:41:03 2015 UTC,Maybe levels of veterancy can give points which you can use for upgrade paths for the unit.
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3bhi,nickbass95,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:03:16 2015 UTC,Similar to the way Panzer Elite worked in vCOH?  I like it.
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3bhi,relkin43,2,Wed Jul 22 04:19:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah absolutely; hard to replace and replacements entirely dependant on that wave timer but if you manage to keep them alive it should totally pay off with high veterancy and gear upgrades like better small arms, camo, new tanks, ect."

CompanyOfHeroes,3e3bhi,KorgothBarbaria,8,Tue Jul 21 21:23:34 2015 UTC,I would prefer Italy or a mixed italian + german faction
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3bhi,GeneralOstwind,4,Tue Jul 21 19:48:48 2015 UTC,I think a single German/Italian force representing German and Italian troops in North Africa and eventually the Germans in Italy would fit the bill a little better than just the Afrika Korps itself. I agree as well.

CompanyOfHeroes,3e3bhi,NosyOwl,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:30 2015 UTC,I'm trying to base it on AK's historical dependence on flak cannons.
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3bhi,Sharkeelol,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:09:13 2015 UTC,"The main historical issue is that the Afrika Korp was highly reliant on AT guns (not necessarily the 88mm) to defeat the numerically superior British tanks. Arguably, AT guns played a larger role than even the AK's panzers"
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3bhi,nickbass95,5,Tue Jul 21 19:25:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly AK were heavily reliant on AT guns, and Rommel revolutionised how they were used, so that needs to be part of how they're used.  I think their main AT gun would be half track towed too to add character."
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3bhi,spajn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:10:11 2015 UTC,"No more ""We ate the horse, now start pulling.""?  But in all seriousness, a towed 88 would takes a much longer time to set up and pack up than a regular AT gun.  I fear that opponent who knows its location could just artillery it to death, much like what happens with the stationary pak 43 of the axis already."
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3bhi,relkin43,2,Wed Jul 22 05:19:27 2015 UTC,"Africa Korps had the image of a mobile fighting force (Ghost Division) with poor supply lines and they had to scavenge most of their fuel from defeated Allied forces.  Afrika Korps should be mobile and flexible but requires frontline combat to remained supplied.  Their vehicle crews could leave their vehicles to repair much like USF, but they could also salvage enemy armor like the Scavenge Doctrine. They could carry the enemy vehicle's parts to quickly repair and upvet their vehicles.  They could call in Bergetigers or supply half-tracks that can salvage resources and return them to the base, granting a big boost in supplies. However, their munition and fuel income would be poor. They could have Pathfinder like units that snipe infantry carrying pickups like BARs and guarantee a pickup drop.  There could also be desert maps, with sand storms or heatwaves, that would give your soldiers heatstroke. The wells scattered around the map could let them stay alive in the heat. Vehicles could be strapped with water or something like that."
CompanyOfHeroes,3e3bhi,Suldani,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:01:09 2015 UTC,"Guaranteeing a drop would be pretty unbalanced IMO, but maybe would be reasonable if you gated it behind an ability costing a token amount of munitions or made it RNG dependent.  Maybe like 20-30 munitions or a 25% chance per shot?  If you can walk the line between useless and spammable, you'll have a really cool unit.   You'd have to have some sort of a timer so the squad that dropped it couldn't pick it back up as soon as it was dropped."

However, I think it would be best if this Afrika Korps faction was a mix of German and Italian troops. Since the Italians were not significant enough to have their own faction, and yet just significant enough to be kept into consideration I think we would be well off making it a mix (Mainly German troops though). People have a lot of great ideas on what could be added, and I agree. Marders, 88mm, it would all be awesome. I really hope we get this faction, and that it will also have Italian elements just like the Afrika Korps had in real life."

CompanyOfHeroes,3e4q7p,Tetracyclon,2,Tue Jul 21 23:42:06 2015 UTC,It would be more fair if it hit in an circle area rather than a line. Thats the real issue
CompanyOfHeroes,3e4q7p,rshunter313,2,Wed Jul 22 00:04:03 2015 UTC,"Stuka is OKWs only counter when USF blobs all its riflemen, and when Soviets decide to build nothing but Maxims and AT guns.  Without it USF can freely run about map in a giant horde uncontested for the most part.  And saying you cant dodge it is ridiculous. First off don't put all your units the same spot, because if you cant dodge it that is exactly what your doing. Also you can hear the thing firing, if you hear the rockets MOVE, spread out your men or retreat.  Not to mention OKW needs to get some bite for its buck. 100 fuel is a lot for a faction that is already resource handicapped."
CompanyOfHeroes,3e4q7p,notsosupermutant,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:53:06 2015 UTC,"The Walking Stuka is really only effective against static emplacements/weapons teams, wiping them with ease. But if you're moving your infantry correctly, as some other commenters have said, you should be able to keep the bulk of your army out of harm's way.  Sure, sometimes as OKW I'll get lucky and manage to wipe a ton of units - but that happens very rarely. More often than not, I completely miss because my opponent keeps his units moving, and now I have to wait a minute and a half before I can even think about using it again."
CompanyOfHeroes,3e4q7p,PetyrBearlish,2,Wed Jul 22 03:37:53 2015 UTC,"I think the only real problem with the Stuka at the moment is the amount of damage it does to building. I'm usually able to dodge the bulk of the rockets because I'll move all my troops once I hear the sound. However when it comes to buildings, it will one shot most buildings before you can have your MG escape. You can't even pick up the dead MG if the crew dies in the house which can be a bit frustrating.   Stuka can seem a bit OP when you dont really know how to deal with it. I find that if I'm making a big push against someone and I hear the rockets coming, I just keep moving my units forward. Chances are they'll have placed the rockets slightly behind where you are, in anticipation that you'll retreat them upon hearing the sound. I manage to avoid most blasts this way.  Keep in mind that if the OKW has chosen to bring out a stuka, it means that they've spent 100 fuel on it, which is ALOT for OKW. You need to respond to this by going heavy on the armor and a little lighter on the infantry. Build a fuel cache, spread your units out. If you play USF, you can probably drive your sherman right in his base, pop some smoke, and just do an attack ground on the stuka. 2 hits should kill it and you can probably crush some infantry while you're in there.  Honestly it kinda sounds like you're just salty and want to rant."

CompanyOfHeroes,3e4q7p,scales999,2,Wed Jul 22 00:23:38 2015 UTC,How so
CompanyOfHeroes,3e4q7p,M4ve12ick0,0,Wed Jul 22 00:35:17 2015 UTC,It doesn't cost any fuel for OKW to get panzershrecks or a Raketenwerfer.
CompanyOfHeroes,3e4q7p,scales999,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:37:49 2015 UTC,"I've done this strategy many times, if you use your smoke right, and leave when things get too dangerous, you should be okay. Try it!"
CompanyOfHeroes,3e4q7p,M4ve12ick0,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:44:36 2015 UTC,I've said this before - I don't believe its balanced that OKW get an artillery unit with a precision barrage at Vet 0.  Considering that precision strike on all forms of artillery for the soviets have been removed and creeping barrage on the priest is no where near as effective - the stuka should be addressed.
CompanyOfHeroes,3e4q7p,scales999,2,Wed Jul 22 00:01:45 2015 UTC,"I've used the Walking Stuka alot and all I can say is that, while it can be targeted in a line, the chance of it hitting what YOU want, is quite low. For example. If I see loads of Soviets dug in somewhere, with mixed infantry and armor, It is not very often you kill many of them. Just because you can aim it in a line, doesn't mean it will hit and destroy everything in that line. Quite a little amount, actually."
CompanyOfHeroes,3e4q7p,Fikaknugz,4,Wed Jul 22 01:12:53 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely not true.  The Stuka barrage wipes squads on a consistent basis.  Contrast to a Katyusha which has a tendency to launch rocket barrages with the accuracy of cross-eyed, epileptic Parkinson's victim.  I've had Katyusha barrages that have hit all around enemy units that never even moved and the barrage kills no one or occasionally one individual squad member."
CompanyOfHeroes,3e4q7p,cplcarlman,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:52:52 2015 UTC,That's a completely fair point - the Katyusha is a much-shittier counterpart to the Walking Stuka (I can't believe it has the same cooldown time). But it has much farther range and is therefore a lot more difficult to kill.
CompanyOfHeroes,3e4q7p,PetyrBearlish,2,Wed Jul 22 03:41:13 2015 UTC,The same thing could be said about precision artillery strike for the soviets.  But that got removed from all of their artillery.   No other artillery is as accurate as the walking stuka at Vet 0.
CompanyOfHeroes,3e4q7p,scales999,0,Wed Jul 22 01:15:30 2015 UTC,1v1 games going on have like 20-30 people in it. Team games have 100-200 players at any given time.   Why do we balance for 10% of the playerbase instead of the 90%?

CompanyOfHeroes,3dywz5,notsosupermutant,15,Mon Jul 20 17:40:07 2015 UTC,"It was a good idea, but the problem was that it favored Germans. American squad sizes were 6 people (5 in CoH2) whereas Germans were only 4. This meant that they could be getting new squads faster. At the same time, having people in your med station still took up the population, even though they were unusable until you had a full squad in them.  An alternative might be that medics can recover a wounded model for a free reinforcement model, but I don't know about the viability of that."
CompanyOfHeroes,3dywz5,USSZim,4,Mon Jul 20 18:30:07 2015 UTC,"recover a wounded model for a free reinforcement model   That's not a bad idea at all, I quite like that.

Relic and SEGA knows that DLC's are just a way to rip off fans of the game. That's why they take a new road while still getting enough money to live their lives (they have to pay rent too). All commanders are possible to win in-game, all camouflages except for a few are possible to win in-game. All new factions are STANDALONE which means you don't have to buy the others so play them.

When i played a while back, (6+months ago) i've been totally unimpressed by this huge chunk of manpower and fuel. tried to make it work really hard , but it just didnt compete with kats and stukas.  I just picked up coh2 , 2 weeks ago and i gotta say , althought nothing changed to it, my perspective of this arty changed. Honestly , i'm not doing anything different, just obviously bombing okw retreat point building, and sometimes you just laugh your ass off. Their accuracy sucks, but you need only 1 shell to make it worth it.  Had a game recently, where i kept trying to bomb out an okw players retreat point. shot like 5-10 rounds, no results. then i got lucky... really lucky :D. priest killed 30 men in one shell,immediatly afterwards the german player left. I gotta say that stuff feels really good.  Mostly it disapppoints, but sometimes they surprise you.   Plus, don't forget about the other perks you get from infantry company. hint : defensive stance of long range BARs. (the most useful)  i barely play 2v2 and 1v1,but not because i'm bad at it, but i dont really get the whole war themed feeling of this game out of them. Massive bombardments , tanks trampling everything and huge pushes? that's what i like to see. 3v3/4v4 delivers (although it's not balanced at all)"

There are two different ways that the Soviet player can eliminate the OP Axis mg's (and yes, in the current game state they are OP in regards to their unit cost vs. their damage output/suppression ability.)  The first way to deal with them is to go Scout Car and Penal Troops. You can equip them with flamethrower and decimate the mg squads. Make sure you have some troops nearby to take the mg and you can use their own weapons against them.  The second way takes a little longer,  but is better because there comes a point very quickly in the game where the Scout Car just isn't a viable unit anymore. I like to build T3 as soon as I can and then field an M5 Quad-Mount halftrack. In the current game state,  that unit lives up to its nickname as the Kraut-mower. It can also be used to reinforce troops from. Just make sure you have some screening troops around it and get out of there as soon as you see a tank show up."

Avoiding - minimise blobbing (pretty hard to do with OKW) and keep the blob moving. If you hear it fire, try and spread in all directions and not just forward or backwards.  Hunting - either do a sneaky sneaky strike force with either call in falls or a small blob of volks with shreks (retreat if discovered) or go for a puma glory run. Trying to hunt it down is usually a pretty futile task unless they make some pretty bad mistakes or you are able to break the line.   Just remember the Kat is a total lucksack if it's firing at long ranges so if you can keep the opponent wary enough that they have to keep it far back it should help mitigate the worst of it."

Wait till your opponent is attacking with his men then take any sort of armoured vehicle and rush to his base with it, making sure to go down the side he's not currently attacking. At the very least this will force him to pull back men from his attack to protect the katyusha, allowing you a better chance to win the engagement. If he doesn't pull men back and even if you don't find the katyusha you can at least then attack his men from the rear.   I've seen this work 2 or 3 times in matches before."
CompanyOfHeroes,3dtlmc,Charismaztex,3,Sun Jul 19 12:37:32 2015 UTC,"Avoiding: Hard to to if you've already set up a battlegroup in a relatively exposed position; even if behind a huge building, the shot block will eventually get destroyed. Smart players will usually target the battlegroup when low-health squads are retreating back to the battlegroup.  Hunting: the best bet to solve the problem. Utilise recon overflight or flares from teammates if in a team game and remember to take mine sweepers along. Again good players like to mine the flanks of their artillery.   I want to add another: stuka counter barrage. There's a bit of RNG because you don't know the exact spot the rockets are going to hit and you need a direct hit on the katy; splash damage will not fully take it out.  In general some players get a bit greedy when going for the battlegroup, which is a no-brainer. You could possibly even creep up using a stealth raketen or a vet 1 jp4."

A stuka also works, fire when you hear them start the volley, or if you know where they are hiding.  If this is 1v1 you could try not to do a forward medic bunker, put it in your base so it's safer.

CompanyOfHeroes,3dtlmc,PleaseTrade,3,Sun Jul 19 11:14:35 2015 UTC,"I play soviets pretty much exclusively, and whenever an OKW player destroys my truck it is because of the stuka or fallschirms. Fallschirms can really be devastating, even their rifles damage the truck, let alone their panzerfaust. The stuka is a good option, also because it allows you to get rid of those pesky soviet machine guns. If you're feeling lucky, rushing a panther in to shoot it up and then quickly retreat it can also work. Happens to me a lot, and my Zis-gun will usually fail to destroy the panther before it has returned to the safety of the OKW base. Good luck!"

CompanyOfHeroes,3dtnq2,joe1113,7,Sun Jul 19 10:12:44 2015 UTC,"The current unit behaviour is due to a patch that rolled out quite some time ago with the intention of both making the game feel more responsive and improving the cover system.  The patch did make improvements in both fronts: the game did feel more responsive and units stopped jumping out of cover as often. These improvements, however, came with a tradeoff. Units used to be a bit more ""lifelike"" before: they would react more to things happening near them, they'd hit the ground with explosions going off near them; when moving, they wouldn't do so in perfect unison, some soldiers would trail behind and so forth. However, all of this had a negative effect in unit responsiveness and made the game feel a lot more ""sticky"", for a lack of a better word.   On the other hand, changes to the cover system made units bunch up a lot more in cover, back in the day units would spread out a bit more when in cover, in a more ""natural"" way. This meant that soldiers would stick out of cover pretty often, which could be very frustrating in some cases as a single soldier out of cover could mean the difference between a squad winning or losing an engagement. The new cover system makes soldiers bunch up when in cover, which makes it harder for units to stick out of cover as often but has the rather obvious side effect of making them much more vulnerable to AoE.  tl;dr A patch intentionally made units behave like this. Reverting to a previous state would solve the issue but would also bring back old problems."

OP singled out maxims and riflemen, but Axis have more to lose with their smaller squad sizes.

CompanyOfHeroes,3dtnq2,Kubelecer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:42:46 2015 UTC,But all other grenades are pin-point accurate. I've noticed the rifle nade radius may be bigger than o ther non-elite infantry nades.

CompanyOfHeroes,3dtnq2,Kubelecer,2,Mon Jul 20 04:23:02 2015 UTC,make every squad spread out more please.
CompanyOfHeroes,3dtnq2,NLWoody,2,Sun Jul 19 11:42:06 2015 UTC,Yeah.. A single rifle grenade can wipe a maxim. Really unfair.
CompanyOfHeroes,3dtnq2,HauntedGrass,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:35:38 2015 UTC,"Witnessing a fresh Con squad get wiped off the map from a single rifle grenade is enough to make a man cry.  But not me, I used THOSE tears up when a single, regular mortar round squad wiped a near-mint Shocks squad in one blast."
CompanyOfHeroes,3dtnq2,RustyNumbat,0,Sun Jul 19 14:45:58 2015 UTC,"A single grenade can wipe an MG42. Is that unfair as well?  Edit: It is even more likely to wipe, because the grenade will explode before the MG has packed up..."
CompanyOfHeroes,3dtnq2,Mandarion,7,Sun Jul 19 13:38:27 2015 UTC,"It was. A Grenadier could run up to an Allied machine gun, run right into its field of fire, get suppressed and simply fire a rifle grenade which will almost invariably eliminate a 50 cal and, in most cases, bring a Maxim squad down to 1-2 models and a sliver of health. Then the glorious Maxim retreat nonsense kicks in and it's typically a wipe.   Whereas Allied soldiers stepping into the field of fire of an MG42 are immediately suppressed and pinned and must flank in order to grenade it (unless they smoke it).  The rifle grenade nonsense has been nerfed in the upcoming patch, thank the prophets."
CompanyOfHeroes,3dtnq2,velmarg,-4,Sun Jul 19 13:54:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that doesn't solve the problem with smoke. Especially with Shock Troops, who just trololo through any hard counter except vehicles (well, they can even severely punish a 222)..."
CompanyOfHeroes,3dtnq2,Mandarion,3,Sun Jul 19 13:58:39 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's unfair. Every mg should have their men spread out. I was just using maxim as an example."
CompanyOfHeroes,3dtnq2,HauntedGrass,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:49:49 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay. Question is, if spread out positions will be the solution - we had that before and especially on MGs it was impossible to get all the men into cover (which also made the camouflage upgrade for the MG42 useless, because it would just never camouflage)..."

CompanyOfHeroes,3do93u,Mandarion,2,Sat Jul 18 13:06:07 2015 UTC,"One of the Design Goals for the Wehrmacht was to give the faction flexibility in which they could tech. However, that was not the case due to the expensive nature of their battle phases. By offsetting the costs to the buildings instead of the upgrade it gives players an easier time to upgrade through battle phases.    Battle Phase 3  * decreased from 200/60 to 100/45    Tech Buildings * Building 4 increased from 160/30 to 260/75   Wait a second, so it gets even more expensive in return? From 60 fuel to 45 fuel is a 15 fuel difference. From 30 fuel to 75 fuel is a 45 fuel difference. So in fact, it costs 30 fuel more to get the first Panther, for the faction that already has the highest teching costs (and that is only for Tier 3, with the new cost it will be even worse...).  Am I being dumb here, or is Relic failing at math again?!  Edit: Ah yes, I dared to speak out against an Axis nerf. Stay as you are, subreddit, stay as you are: Dogmatic and hateful..."

CompanyOfHeroes,3do93u,Kubelecer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:53:33 2015 UTC,Why would you ever take an e8 as your first tank after a major?
CompanyOfHeroes,3do93u,Foodball,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:28:16 2015 UTC,It really depends on the situation. I don't think the e8 is meant to be a mid game tank like the Sherman (unless you are really ahead on fuel).
CompanyOfHeroes,3do93u,Kubelecer,2,Mon Jul 20 06:06:59 2015 UTC,"Then what tank is it supposed to be, it is not good vs panthers and tigers nor is it good enough against infantry to get it early. If you want something vs a stug or a p4 an at gun and a normal sherman will do for less fuel. Even zookas are decent enough for those"
CompanyOfHeroes,3do93u,Foodball,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:13:42 2015 UTC,It's there to replace the Sherman after the first one goes out. Whenever you need a generalist tank (ie after you have 1-2 jacksons) you get an e8. In this sense it's used like a t34 or p4.  It's not the best solution to any specific threat (other than axis light - medium armour) but it can do a decent job wherever you put it.

CompanyOfHeroes,3dmu83,essenceofreddit,4,Fri Jul 17 15:34:32 2015 UTC,"You basically got played a full anti-okw strat that exploits all the weaknesses.  Penals are really good against volks, and an m3 puts even more pressure on you since you have to spend precious early manpower on a raketen to counter it. 1CP MG34s are nice to hold it back, however I usually go for pfusiliers since they will trade out the penals efficiently once you get vet and g43s, and provide a good counter to guards.  Wihtout an Ostheer teammate with a stuka bomb, the howitzer will pretty much play with your trucks all game unless you can afford a stuka.   Guards are Guards, the most cost efficient, and thankfully getting nerfed next patch, infantry in the game. Every infantry engagment will be favourable in model and manpower losses for him. Obers can work, however PTRS snipes will take a model down to half hp, and youre looking at 50 mp as opposed to 27, and guards are generally going to outtrade you.  Since OKW cant really pakwall with raketens, SU76s in numbers become pretty tough to deal with, especially with any armour.  The way to counter the su76s at least is to get a jagdpanzer. Itll kill the su76s in a few shots, and youlll get the amazing vet bonuses. Im sure the vet 5 camo bonus can one shot an su76 but im not 100%."
CompanyOfHeroes,3dmu83,iTzDusty,3,Fri Jul 17 15:57:39 2015 UTC,Thanks Dusty. I really appreciate it.
CompanyOfHeroes,3dmu83,thefonztm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:15:05 2015 UTC,FWIW you can use a mine to deal with the M3. Clown cars are very predictable.
CompanyOfHeroes,3dmu83,iTzDusty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:42:02 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah definitely. Maps like Kholodny have awesome mine spots that are super easy to bait onto. The only issue for OKW is the almost necessity of getting a panzerschreck as early as possible, so using mines/nades early is a little bit risky. Doable though, a mine is super important early game."
CompanyOfHeroes,3dmu83,shitfit_,2,Fri Jul 17 17:57:14 2015 UTC,"lay a mine and park your kubel ""behind"" it. the clownscar will most likely try to park infront and thus on the mine. Works 99% of the time and it always cracks me up seeing cheese fail horribly."

CompanyOfHeroes,3dmu83,MolotovFromHell,2,Fri Jul 17 17:15:46 2015 UTC,"The damage from the PTRS is going from 40 to 27, which makes it somewhat less of an ersatz sniper rifle with anti-vehicular potential combined with a six-man squad."
CompanyOfHeroes,3dmu83,MolotovFromHell,3,Fri Jul 17 17:16:01 2015 UTC,Just read the patch notes. Damage reduced to 27 like you said but vehicle dmg gets 13 bonus.  Basically it's a anti infantry nerf while the vehicle dmg stays the same as before.
CompanyOfHeroes,3dmu83,Tomakaze,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:19:01 2015 UTC,Sounds like you needed a stuka ASAP.  It deals with the infantry spam and also would have dealt with the howitzer. I tend to get stuka often when I play okw it just works so well against mass infantry.  Also panther demolishes su76s. Strong frontal long range so you basically have their range but are much more tanky. Use the rakketen you got earlier to counter the clown car for covering the reverse of the panther.  Also as okw whenever I see a clown car with flamers and I have no form of at yet I just retreat right away. It's too risky to try to engage unless you have all your squads in one place so they can focus it with small arms.  Just my two cents on this.

Edit: Seems like its not intentional, might have something to do with p47s accidentally getting camo detection like recon planes. Got a replay? Otherwise I'll test it out in cheatmod right now.  Double edit: Apparently P47s have a detection radius of 10 for camoed units, recon planes have 90. Its essentially a super small value that will almost never detect camoed units unless its right on top of them. I called in 20 p47s at once, and once a single plane went over and decloaked the tank, the jagdpanzer recloaked, though the p47s fired on the last known position when they circled back, destroying it. Likely going to get removed since its a pretty useless value and just makes 5% of engagements weird."

I think I restarted the battle three times. But I was determined to see if they were immortal.  I had a fixed line near my base, with the three (or four?) AT guns set up behind tank traps, and the tanks and tank destroyers able to rush and flank them when they approached and bazooka infantry. I estimate the Ostwinds were soaking up only 5% the damage they should have. I was only JUST able to to take out two and the third limped away. I lost 90% of my forces, which were all specialized AT.  The only way I could do it was by using tank traps to limit their approach to a final VP they were after, having my whole AT army there, and micro-managing flanking moves with armor while paused. Even then I was tearing my hair out and only just won. And this was on Normal difficulty."
CompanyOfHeroes,3dleb5,AdmiralAsia,5,Mon Jul 20 14:25:42 2015 UTC,"As a different view to some other replies, I think AA is the best Company of Heroes campaign (including all the ones from COH and the Soviet campaign from COH 2). It was never worth $40 but it is a steal when you can grab it for $20 or less.   AA adds an additional layer of depth to a COH 2 campaign. There's sort of a turn-based element, a campaign map that's similar to Total War. You have to manage your companies and be careful in battle -- it is essentially the anti-Soviet campaign where you were (for better or for worse) encouraged to throw away Conscript squads.   AA is all about keeping your troops alive because you will need that manpower for later battles. You also have to make decisions on the campaign map about how to upgrade / reinforce your companies and when to cut off enemy maneuvers. If you do not cut off enemy reinforcements on the campaign map, they will add to the strength of remaining forces and you might end up w/ really difficult battles towards the end of the game.   Some of the scenarios are very challenging. The one guy who replied was basically bitching the game was too hard and it is more challenging than other campaigns, but also more rewarding. It's possible to ""lose"" the campaign by running out of manpower and having your three companies destroyed. So you gotta play at least somewhat intelligently to win, even on normal.   Like I said, it's the best COH campaign in my book. I got it for $13 through a Steam sale and it was a blast."

CompanyOfHeroes,3di7q0,Baydestrian,2,Thu Jul 16 23:07:38 2015 UTC,"One of my best strategies that pays dividends later on is throwing grenades in the path of infantry or crew served weapons.  People who are watching their infantry tend to move their squads as soon as the motion for a grenade starts. Either they get closer, or farther; shock troops for example are generally running towards you. A volks squad can easily force a retreat by throwing the grenade in the path of their advance, usually killing at least half the squad. Is the enemy squad in green cover? Throw the grenade a little bit behind them, enough for at least half the blast radius to still hit them if they don't move; usually this will mean they move into the blast if they attempt to avoid it.  The other day I killed the entire crew of a Pak-40 that got caught by surprise trying to retreat from my riflemen. Threw the grenade behind them as soon as the crew picked up the gun, and they moved exactly into the radius of the blast.  This also works extremely well with Fallschirmjagers/Obersoldaten smoke grenades. Throw them in the path of any charging infantry, retreat a bit while they are slowed, and you can cut them to pieces while their health drains.  Its little things like this that tip firefights in your favor, and generally their impact is magnified as their units cede the field and you get that much more resource income while they are pushed off."

They have accuracy modifier for ALL of their weapons, including those that they pick up. That gives them fantastic fire-power with BARs. .50 caliber airdrop is a solid option too. When you're going Airborne Company, 3 out of 4 times you'll go Lieutenant for fast M20. LT gives you access to .50 cal, but it takes time to build. Paradropping one and recrewing it with Rear Echelons is more expensive, but it allows you to get the MG on the field instantly. Paratroopers. Tough as nails, great weapon upgrades and reinforce at the same cost as Riflemen. If you lose one of your Rifles, get Paratroopers on the field instead. 57mm AT Gun Drop is one of the best things in this doctrine. It allows you to completely skip Captain tier for solid anti-tank options, before you get to the Jacksons that is. Just like the .50 cal, you get it almost instantly wherever you want it to be. Finally, the P-47s. Area denial, when enemy tanks are healthy and with working engines. Marvellous tank killer, when enemy engines are broken.

CompanyOfHeroes,3dgptd,UnhopefulRomantic,5,Thu Jul 16 03:24:48 2015 UTC,I mean they are glass cannons in every sense of the word.   They have awesome range and penetration but don't do great damage and their barrage ability won't hit the broad side of a barn unless you get close which puts it in danger...not to mention they have poor armor and health.  The Stug does more damage and has more armor and the gun is better against infantry.
CompanyOfHeroes,3dgptd,mrthicky,3,Thu Jul 16 07:08:52 2015 UTC,"They are perfectly fine where they are now, in basically every aspect (I quite like the new SU-76, but going over the top with it would be a bit dumb). And no, the barrage is useful against infantry, the range allows even for taking out PaKs if you do it smartly.  The StuG actually does worse against infantry (less AOE, higher scatter), and is more expensive, so of course it's going to be be better in some ways (i.e. better armour and better penetration)..."
CompanyOfHeroes,3dgptd,Mandarion,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:51:05 2015 UTC,"Smartly or luckily, at max range you are praying to the RNG gods for good hits with the barrage, otherwise I agree that they are in a pretty good place.  PLus the Stug will soon not be as good against infantry because Relic fixed their little decimal error (near accuracy vs infantry was fixed from 0.6 to 0.06)"
CompanyOfHeroes,3dgptd,Tomakaze,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:15:44 2015 UTC,Stug is already terrible at killing infantry but it's a great TD and should be supporting infantry.  Don't think I'm even going to notice that change.  SU-76 is pretty all around good though I hate it's barrage - allies already get enough BS indirect fire.
CompanyOfHeroes,3dgptd,relkin43,4,Tue Jul 21 16:11:43 2015 UTC,You forget that SU-76 should be second line tanks who do not soak up damage. Get a .50 cal and either two of these or normal zis-76 with some forward infrantry or heavy tanks to soak up damage.

CompanyOfHeroes,3dgptd,ShadySim,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:10:26 2015 UTC,"We actually ended up winning. The key with SU76 spam is to keep ALL your tanks alive. I played very conservatively with my first panther to the point where it was almost static half the game. Finally I got a King Tiger, a Jagdpanzer, and a Luchs out. The KT and Luchs stomped out their infantry blobs and baited out the SU76 mob. Once they came the KT soaked up most of the shells while Jagd picked some of them off. When they were pulling back me and my teammates panther ran up on them and started going to town, Jagd and KT advanced behind them.   They're very powerful and their barrage ability in a blob can be highly effective, but if you can keep your tanks alive then you can use your superior vehicles to take them out, as the SU76 is pretty fragile. Still, that was in a 4v4 match with coordinating teamates..."

CompanyOfHeroes,3dfa2q,kelton312,-1,Thu Jul 16 06:52:31 2015 UTC,"RIP team games as allies, PTRS was the only thing giving us somewhat of a chance against infantry. Hopefully the maxim suppression helps somewhat. Edit - Axis players I am happy for you and look forward to playing against mass amounts of 222s, but I don't get the downvotes, play some team games as allies?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3dfa2q,NLWoody,3,Thu Jul 16 13:54:28 2015 UTC,I think this actually leaves zero allied infantry units that can stand up against equivalently prices axis units in the late game. Conscripts and lose horribly upgraded Grens. Penals and Shocks have to stand 3 inches away to do any damage.

CompanyOfHeroes,3dfzbt,Smoked_Peasant,2,Thu Jul 16 18:24:02 2015 UTC,"Out of all the ""potential"" new Axis factions, I always thought the Italians had enough going for them to be made into their own faction.  Many people miss the 88 from COH1, but you could have the Italian 90.  They had distinct infantry like the Bersagliari and Folgore. The way the commander system works, you could have ones that utilize German support like a call in Tiger for one to help with late game.  If you have ever played R.U.S.E., take a look at their unit list they have for the Italian faction.  There is certainly potential."

I don't think it's ""dying"" anyway, RTS is just a small niche genre these days and CoH doesn't have the name recognition of it's competitors, but it has a decent playerbase for what it is. The game is still being heavily supported and CoH2 now feels like a much better game than it was on release."
CompanyOfHeroes,3djw8t,Ironcl4d,3,Thu Jul 16 22:56:17 2015 UTC,I'm with you - I'd would love to have arranged teams separate from random teams but as you said not enough players to do that

CompanyOfHeroes,3djw8t,Johnny_G93,-6,Thu Jul 16 21:44:12 2015 UTC,"The point is the experience level and the obviously flawed matchmaking, killing any type of new user experience leading to a smaller and smaller player base."
CompanyOfHeroes,3djw8t,COH-CIV-TW,5,Thu Jul 16 23:29:35 2015 UTC,a lot of those 3 stars are usually people who bulletin farm. i've beaten tons of them.   it doesn't denote skill.
CompanyOfHeroes,3djw8t,Johnny_G93,2,Fri Jul 17 00:22:12 2015 UTC,Experience level has nothing to do with your skill value. Matchmaking works as good as limited number of players allows it. Sorry that we don't live in a perfect world. New player must firstly play 10 games against random opponents to get his skill rating. This system is used in many other games and works well. I've beaten many maxed out players and have been beaten by no prestige level 20-30. Just play better guys...
CompanyOfHeroes,3djw8t,SD0S,-1,Fri Jul 17 00:46:37 2015 UTC,"You don't just play better when you've only played 20~ games split between two factions. Skill is one thing, but experience isn't something you can just ignore. And the random match is just stupid, instead of placing you in the middle and finding worse or better opponents based on performance it just throws random players at you? How can I be the only person who sees an issue with that."
CompanyOfHeroes,3djw8t,antnerd,5,Fri Jul 17 01:04:38 2015 UTC,How can it figure out who's better or worse than you if you've never played against anyone before? The whole point of the 10 games is to figure out how good of a player you are so you can start being paired with similar players.
CompanyOfHeroes,3djw8t,Johnny_G93,-1,Fri Jul 17 01:50:23 2015 UTC,That was like my 8th 3v3. If I already lost 6-7 of them why would it continue to place me against players that are higher than those I've already lost to.
CompanyOfHeroes,3djw8t,TwatBrah,2,Fri Jul 17 01:54:52 2015 UTC,2 more games to go lawl
CompanyOfHeroes,3djw8t,TwatBrah,3,Fri Jul 17 05:37:03 2015 UTC,Why should it place you in the middle? That's ridiculous. If you are bad you are going to lose 10 games. You are the ony one do sees the problem with it because apparently you don't get how placement algorithm works. If it would place you in the middle and you would lose those 10 games what rating should you get? 0 or just below those that you fought? Seriously if you don't know why it places you against random people to test your skill then I'm not going to bother explaining it to you further. When I said play better I meant that you should try to learn something with every game you play. Look at build orders of your opponents. Look at guides on the internet. Watch few casts on YT. Play some comp stomp games against hard or expert bots to get the feel of each faction. What you shoudn't do is to go on reddit and complain...

CompanyOfHeroes,3djw8t,kelton312,4,Fri Jul 17 17:10:13 2015 UTC,"Game has a very small amount of online activity. Anyone saying otherwise is a little deluded. If I remember correctly it was approximately 50 on people playing the game with about 5,000 people playing. Not sure of the figures that are actually playing the multiplayer player vs player part of the game but with the lovely addition of the spectator system there arn't many games to spectate and there wern't many people spectating them.  Now, if you love the game. Try to appreciate the really good things than being unnecessarily defensive as if CoH 2 is played by millions at any given time.  Even with the low activity the game is getting strong support from the developers. It's adding new content, even though it's in the form of paid DLC, the price of the new factions is very reasonable and adds a lot of variety to the game.   CoH 1 was the same. It had a small active community but the amount of effort that the community put in to keep the game alive was really staggering. That's something to be very proud of and is undeniable!"
CompanyOfHeroes,3djw8t,rapescenario,2,Thu Jul 16 21:57:24 2015 UTC,"What I don't understand is what enjoyment high skill axis players get out of repeatedly steamrolling allies in team matches. It is already unbalanced, add to that 3 good players working together and it makes a combo only beaten by the greatest of cheese tactics. We often play matches that we have to surrender in the first 10 minutes because the entire map is locked down by MGs and kubels perfectly microd in every choke."

CompanyOfHeroes,3djw8t,pho7on,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:41:35 2015 UTC,"It isn't dying.  Also the Prestige doesn't reflect skills in ANY way, only game time. And no, experience doesn't matter if the player is bad to begin with: I've played against Prestige 3 guys with 5000+ hours played (against players, not AIs) who were atrocious (think 40% win rate with 4500-6000 games played).  On the other hand I once almost left a game when I got matched against experienced (high ranked) players while having a level 28 ish in my team. I checked his profile just to make sure and he had a few games played, sure, but 98% win rate. He then proceeded to keep that winrate and get #1 in 3v3 and 4v4, and I'm pretty sure he still isn't lvl 300 today. Oh and he was really good and carried the team this time and the few other times I got him in my team since :).  The matchmaking system is fine, and has been used in different variations in many other games before. The problem is the number of players. Say you're ranked top 3 in 4v4, and you want to play a game. The MMS will first look for players or equal skill level, aka top 10 or top 15 players (it's not based on your rank tho but an hidden elo rating, I'm using ranks to explain in an simpler way).  First option: the MMS finds 7 other players in your skill range who  have selected the right factions and are looking for a game too, boom the game starts right away. To be honest, it never happens unless you're high ranked as axis in solo random and you get matched against an equally high ranked arranged ally team. But in solo queue, never.  Second option: the game cannot find enough equally skilled opponents to find a game, so it widens it's search area, looking for people who are less high ranked. If it doesn't find enough of them, the bar lowers again, then again, etc. until it finds a game. Sometimes, when very few people are online, it's possible for top3 players to be matched against beginners (I've played against true level 0 players a few times myself).  Let's be honest, it wasn't the case here. CoH2 isn't a game where the most skilled player wins 100% of the time. Strategy is important, momentum too, and there are many other factors such as the map, the RNG, and of course the factions (which are now more balanced than ever).  tl;dr: you are not a pro (as you said so yourself) and you weren't matched against pros on that particular game. Level doesn't matter and losing is frustrating, but you don't learn anything by destroying helpless noobs, so keep playing and if you really want to progress then you'll be good someday. CoH2 can be hard on the feelings :p"

Of course you aren't skipping t1, but you now don't have to invest in it as your first built entity 99% of the time. Calling in an ostruppen with an MG42 at the start at the game actually works now since that extra manpower that's so crucial early on to build t1 can be delayed a few minutes.  The build time increase also delays the time they come on the field now, so people building two mgs off the bat will have trouble getting them to support each other."

If shock troops come out or paratroops with thompsons then you should be a little scared but if not, they can easily control the map.

CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,COH-CIV-TW,6,Thu Jul 16 15:11:00 2015 UTC,"Build them on your cutoffs.  Never get them early at the expense of a squad/field presence, if you get pushed off the superior enemy force can even blow up your cache.  Mid/late game, build them if you are floating to deny points."
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,iTzDusty,5,Wed Jul 15 16:46:34 2015 UTC,"Apparently I'm an oddball, but when I get caches I try to get them early. I have some strategies that are very munitions intensive. I'm ok with being a little behind with the size of my force because I feel I can make up for it with the abilities I'm going to use.  For Rifle Company sometimes I get a rifle then a mun cache on the first point I cap. Then I get a veteran rifle. The timer ends right about when you get 300 MP."
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,thefonztm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:51:34 2015 UTC,"Ha, I noticed the same with Rifle Company. But sometimes I just get an extra RE and a Fighting Position  Higher return on investment when you get those caches early. Sweet sweet munitions!"
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,damnmonk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:35:47 2015 UTC,"I'm ok with being a little behind with the size of my force because I feel I can make up for it with the abilities I'm going to use.   That's because it's a high risk, low reward situation. By having a higher field presence you are also much more likely to hold a bigger territory, which in turn means you will be getting more resources anyways. On the other hand, getting a cache instead of a squad might have a serious impact in your field presence, which in turn means you could get pushed off the field, putting your cache at risk.  It's not like it can't work, though. It's certainly doable and particularly strong if you manage to trade equally/favorably and hold off your opponent with fewer units."
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,basedyonder,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:09:16 2015 UTC,But if you build more infantry instead of muni cache you have a higher chance to get more points and more muni income which in the end results in the same as having a muni cache plus you have more squads.  Otherwise you are potentially giving up a point or two because of lack of infantry and you end up in a worse situation in end.
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,MolotovFromHell,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:45:56 2015 UTC,"With that Vet Rifle build I'm trying to save manpower, surprisingly. I count on being able to bluff strength enough that 90% of the enemies I get aren't pushy enough. Usually I can get my self an evenish split and then sorta hope the enemy decides to settle in.  My usual start is Rifle - mun cache - Vet Rifle - grenades - Vet rifle.... into various. The key is I'm trying to 'save' the MP I would normally spend reinforcing to get a squad up to vet 1/2. Paying an extra 20 MP is a steal for a vet 1-2 rifle squad. It's not even the cost of a single reinforcement.  The early grenades allow me quick access to smoke so I can stall and bluff. The mun cache helps keep the smoke going.  I'm also experimenting with using a second RET instead of the first rifle."
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,thefonztm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:05:29 2015 UTC,I like to build munitions caches early some games so I can have like 600 munitions when I can call lingering air supports.
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,one2one2v2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:13:37 2015 UTC,"There's definitely good reasons to build a muni cache very quickly, I used to rely on a three engineer into two M3s build that tried heavily on getting early as possible flamers. Without the cache both flames get delayed and the strat loses its shock value. I've since changed to three cons and a second engineer into 1 m3 since it doesn't fuck me over late game though, at the expense of not being able to afford caches."
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,iTzDusty,2,Wed Jul 15 20:07:04 2015 UTC,"1v1's - almost never.  2v2 - sometimes; depends on the map and the flow of the game. If you do get them, wait until you have a few units on the field. There is no point getting them at the start because you are going to get run off the field with no units and your opponents will destroy the caches or gain tremedous field position.  3v3 and 4v4 - for these, I like to coordinate with my team and typically have one person dedicated to making on the fuel caches before they really start pumping out units."
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,pintonium,2,Wed Jul 15 15:45:54 2015 UTC,"Early, typically after the fourth unit as German (ostheer). Manpower is more ""expensive"" the more units you have on the field, so a fuel cache is ""cheapest"" the faster you get it. It's also more effective, as you start to accumulate fuel faster."
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,essenceofreddit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:12:38 2015 UTC,"This is a surprising answer. I see what you're getting at with the manpower upkeep, but Ostheer is definitely the faction that I tend to put off caches the longest, simply can't afford to spend manpower on something that doesn't help with map control."
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,Ironcl4d,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:32:00 2015 UTC,"If you're in your lane, two MGs are usually enough to hold most attacks until they knock them out. I generally go H-R-G-F-(H)-F-F-F-P4"
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,essenceofreddit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:44:04 2015 UTC,"Since you're relying on the same units more, they vet up faster. The MG in particular generally has AP rounds by the time you have your second fuel cache. Two bursts of AP rounds can generally take down or deter light vehicles effectively enough that you don't need a PAK. The build is only really vulnerable to Stuart play, which can be warded off with the grens."
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,essenceofreddit,2,Thu Jul 16 20:46:05 2015 UTC,They are a luxury item for when you know you can keep map control and you are floating manpower.  If you are building caches but losing map control you done goofed.
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,anon4773,2,Wed Jul 15 16:26:56 2015 UTC,I get them early on points that change its owner fast or to lock up points i dont want to protect permanently. Late game only when i have no idea what to do with my floating MP.

CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,DontGetCrabs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:24:34 2015 UTC,I think getting them early especially on a forward point is a really bad idea. All it takes is a flamethrower engie squad to take it down and you're out 200 manpower. Even Assault Rifle/SMG troops and can wear one down without too much trouble.
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,Ironcl4d,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:38:21 2015 UTC,Its more that i dont have to stay with units on that cap to protect it.
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,Tetracyclon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:52:53 2015 UTC,When T70 used to dominate the Luchs I used to build a fuel cache to rush it against OKW. It would absolutely destroy most of them because of their dependence on infantry based AT.
CompanyOfHeroes,3de4jo,mrthicky,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:19:25 2015 UTC,"I always get a fuel cache just before the midgame. Only when I have enough MP, I add more.     Same goes for Medic / CP bunkers when playing as the Wehrmacht, I never build those until I have plenty of MP and Munition."

You lose map control and the fuel points and the game is pretty much over.  The only time I build caches is when I've beaten back the opponent and am firmly entrenched. Otherwise I'd rather much have an extra AT gun, machinegun, or whatever."

CompanyOfHeroes,3daida,AdmiralAsia,6,Wed Jul 15 19:27:49 2015 UTC,call them noobs throughout and be sure to pepper in 'l2p' every time you inflict significant damage  also would recommend demo charging their infantry if SU/US and stuka-dive bombing or zu fuss their retreats if axis
CompanyOfHeroes,3daida,325madison,12,Wed Jul 15 14:29:24 2015 UTC,"The biggest turn off to a new game is an awful atmosphere so be very encouraging and positive.

CompanyOfHeroes,3daida,freedomIndia,2,Tue Jul 14 19:51:34 2015 UTC,"On which maps to choose I can't really give any advice, I generally don't play more than 2v2. But on how to make it more enjoyable is to try and create an equal balance. And give everyone enough time to get into the game. e.g. match up people with a similar skill level and let them play against each other 1v1 for their first time, being accompanied by someone who is more experienced with the game.    Dealing with more larger groups, e.g. 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4. Again try to put people with similar skill levels against each other.    So when making teams, don't put 2 players who have a more strategic insight, or experience with strategic games in one team against people who don't.  Mix it up, 1 and 1. For example.    What I also did once at a party with another strategy game was do a 1v1 map, but divide everyone into a team. So you are still playing 1 team against 1 team, but instead you're going to have to discuss as a team what your next move is going to be.  And switch places each like 10 minutes. It really lets people learn from the playstyle of other players.    But most importantly just have fun. If shit goes wrong because your teammate is not experienced, tell him how he could do it better next time. But also do it to people who aren't in your team."

CompanyOfHeroes,3daida,NLWoody,2,Wed Jul 15 14:40:34 2015 UTC,Manpower is one but there's also:   The time it takes to build a new unit and get that unit in the fight. Losing the XP levels that squad had and any weapons you gave them. Giving intel to your opponent about your army composition.    I think there's even more but that's what I got off the top.
CompanyOfHeroes,3daida,naiuhz,2,Wed Jul 15 14:51:01 2015 UTC,"Play choke point maps like Sittard Summer, Achelous River, and Vire River Valley. This will help by easing up on the flanking encountered and the necessary micro that more open maps like Steppes has.

CompanyOfHeroes,3daua8,abetterthief,10,Tue Jul 14 21:03:11 2015 UTC,"I actually love it now. It truly feels like every faction has to tech to light vehicles. Everybody needs to build at least 3 tech buildings basically. I actually feel like the game has gotten balanced to a degree that it truly feels like rng doesn't determine the game.  OKW feels great. Soviet feels great. USF feels great. Ostheer feels great.  It actually feels like you can comeback too, early to mid game a lot easier. It feels a bit more forgiving.   Knowing that someone holds over half the map makes you feel like welp if i see a tank at like the 12 minute mark and I don't have at least 1 AT out yet normally led to rage quits.  It feels like when I spend my fuel on light vehicles that it isn't a waste. It feels worthwhile and useful.   I think relic did a great job for the teching up structure. Some things may need a little balance with pricing (I am not too sure what yet but do feel it is okay atm, people will probably bitch in the future).   I give relic an A+ for a new idea that works!"

Plus, T34s are expendable as hell, awesome for ramming now.  My OKW games were pretty good too, the new less bleedy sturmpios make getting a 2nd one viable. Building a pair of the new leigs supported by a sturm offizier and an uhu is actually nuts. The new P4 with skirts as default is awesome as it supports infantry so well against emplacements (no more raketens a moving into fighting pits for me), if a little pricy (panther is only 40 worth of OKW fuel more). Havent tried the new sturm tiger yet.  USF games were super easier early mid now, Stuart was quick as hell to get, pack howitzers which I already used heavily last patch are considerably cheaper for me to get, so I sometimes grab a pair (especially on crossing, its frustrating as hell to push against it). Major tech delay came at the right enough time for me to get Jacksons and Easy eights.  Admittedly havent played enough Ost games yet, though the match I did earlier against Brad from Relic as Sovs on Kholodny was pretty funny, he did a pio + mg 42 strat that built caches and multiple flamers to keep me super pressured, he ended up rushing P4s but I was already prepared with a pair of Zis guns and had a t34/76 coming in.

It gets smacked around by Panthers and Tiger ones (which it should dominate) and it cant even do blob removal like an ISU-152 can, is it getting a buff? I have even seen panzer 4's bounce the 122mm round before, I know that is RNG at play, but if the German heavies can kill, our basic tanks in as little as two shots, the Russian heavies should be able too as well."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d9u9t,TheEmperorsChampion,3,Tue Jul 14 23:37:39 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that it was bumped to 13 CP, but the cost remains the same. So it's not more expensive, it just got pushed further into the late game. Also, I've found that the IS2 is good at handling German heavies as long as its well supported."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d9u9t,ZarnoLite,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:10:49 2015 UTC,"How is it 13 cp when its totally under powered? It gets smacked around by Panthers and Tiger ones (which it should dominate)   Ah yes, it gets smacked around by units that as a matter of fact have worse or the same stats. Sure. Let us just take a look at it:     The IS2 comes with 375/205 armour, 220 penetration, 6.5 seconds reload time, max speed of 5, acceleration of 1.7 The Tiger comes with 300/180 armour, 200 penetration, 5.13 seconds reload time, max speed of 4.7, acceleration of 1.5 The Panther comes with 320/110 armour, 240 penetration, 7.38 seconds reload time, max speed of 6.6, acceleration of 2.4 All three deal the exact same damage (160 damage per shot).   So, your tank has the highest frontal armour of those three, almost the best penetration while it also reliably one-shots especially the little 4-man squads of the Ostheer (making their handheld AT useless, no matter how good it is, because why risk 120 munitions to get wiped in one second?), comes with the best vehicle mounted MG (the top-mounted MG42 is okay, but the top-mounted DShK is better) and is also relatively mobile despite its heavy armour. Note that the Tiger and the IS2 cost exactly the same, so the IS2 is even better due to that fact. The only thing that speaks against the IS2 is the reload time, and even here it finds a nice middle ground between the Panther and the Tiger. Cry me a bloody river...  The only people who can actually complain about their tanks are the USF-players (who lack a damage sponge; it kind of works, but it is a limitation that not all players like) or the OKW (the Tiger II costs severely more than the IS2 despite being quite a bit worse or just at the same level as the IS2, except for damage per shot from the main gun).  P.S.: The Panzer IV has 180 frontal armour, the T34/76 has 140 150 frontal armour. Both have the same HP (640). Since both the Tiger and the IS2 deal the same amount of damage, both (not counting in bounces, which are relatively rare due to the low armour on both medium tanks) will take out their respective target with the same amount of hits."

CompanyOfHeroes,3db9b0,HuIkSMASH,2,Wed Jul 15 12:19:25 2015 UTC,"In general, stall for m10/m18.  That stalling entails anything that will mitigate losses, discourage ac movement into your territory, directly threaten acs, and such.  There's a lot of things you could do here, such as baiting an ac into a land mine farther into your own territory, rearranging your army around a 57mm or two, building mg nests, dropping airborne (admittedly this is a poor idea against 4 acs and for late game, but sometimes it will help pull you out of a dire situation), and tank trapping parts of the map.  Of course, in automatch even if you do all these things you're still  probably screwed if neither you nor your teammate build a tank depot and crank out that tank destroyer, so it's prudent to try to plan ahead and communicate if your teammate's teching is not ideal.  I do not recommend using the m8 or halftrack as a solution to the ac problem.  There's a huge mess when it comes to motor pool versus panzer elite light vehicle play.  A nasty ""triangle"" of atht/shrek/treadbreak + mht/teller>m8>ac exists that, in theory, could work out for the American player, but is generally weighted in favor of the Axis player.  It's much worse when playing against a mixed team because of the possibility of bunkers, 88s, and paks supporting all these PE units."
CompanyOfHeroes,3db9b0,HuIkSMASH,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:13:28 2015 UTC,Stalling until t4 takes quite a while. What prevents them from taking complete control of the map in the meanwhile? There is only so much stalling one can do when there are 4 ACs on the field.
CompanyOfHeroes,3db9b0,HuIkSMASH,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:08:08 2015 UTC,"In my experience, if a fuel OP is dropped around the 6-8 minute mark, then the first t4 unit will come out roughly 2-3 minutes after the first or second ac appears.  This is provided that one American player is rushing t4, and that the PE players didn't do something like scout car rush onto their fuel with a vampire as a followup.  On a big map like Duclair it's not too difficult to hold onto the +10 fuel on your side by tank trapping it early on.  It will take a non-trivial amount of time for 1-2 ACs to actually destroy an OP, so you'll have time to add pressure to the map if they commit to taking that out.  Recall that 4 ACs are a pretty significant investment that requires a good support force.  Your window of opportunity to screw with them starts from the time they first build ACs and ends when enough supporting units form.  Any damage you do to the ACs and map harassment you do is particularly effective while they're building ACs because their resources didn't go towards any units that can repair, cap, and counter units that ACs don't cover.  For example, let's say your teammate is going for t4 and you decided to get BARs and the map is Duclair.  It was mentioned that BARs do a decent job at damaging ACs, but are not reliable for finishing them off.  An AC appears along with 3 PG and pick a fight with say 2 riflemen in the immediate vicinity.  So you can't necessarily win the fight, but on the other hand if you run you'll lose the VP and the +10 munitions.  The middle of the road option would be to throw both squads into green cover while your other infantry work around the map.  From the PE player's point of view it actually sucks.  If he moves closer with the AC (even with a second one coming from base) then the BARs will cause a decent amount of damage, and the repairing will take forever.  If he charges in with both the AC(s) and his PG army then he risks losing a PG squad to focused fire.  The safest option for him is to use the AC to fire at your riflemen from max range, but that's a very slow way of kicking rifles out of green cover.  The point is, you'll need to play more carefully and plan ahead--with the t4, mines/TT, and green cover--the moment an AC appears and not when 4 ACs appear.  If you like, I can dig up some replays for you."
CompanyOfHeroes,3db9b0,CherrySlurpee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:51:09 2015 UTC,The rush to m10 really works. Thanks mate. With armor doc's rapid deployment the amount of time between ACs and  the m10 is a lot quicker than expected and most PE players don't see it coming oddly enough.. The only problem is that my rifles are kind of useless for anything other than capping.
CompanyOfHeroes,3db9b0,nickbass95,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:38:47 2015 UTC,"Glad you found some success.  For the player who gets t4, riflemen are too big of a manpower drain to keep on the field while pumping out tanks.  They aren't necessarily useless in combat because of sticky bombs, and BARs will provide a good deterrent against shreks.  Once the ACs are dead the rifles don't have too much to be scared of when supporting tanks."
CompanyOfHeroes,3db9b0,NLWoody,2,Sun Jul 19 01:21:09 2015 UTC,"mines will win you the game.  You have to hold a specific portion of the map and throw mines all over the approaches they use. You won't be able to run around and control the map like you would against a wehr player. One of you should go BARs, another should either get a motor pool or T4. The idea is to hold off the assault with half of the map while they spend resources on cars that won't last to see the endgame"

Pretty much everyone who is not a total axis fanboy agrees that the faction design for T1 is totally boring and then relic releases a patch and talks about how they want to add opening variations to OST, justified or not is a totally different topic, but this is just cynical to talk about variation for OST, which has WAY more variety in T1 already than USF and meanwhile USF has to play the first 5 minutes of the game in the exact same manner for another 2 years."

They're not horrible, but not something you should go for when you want AI not to mention their penetration is not that great when it comes to dealing with axis heavy armor.   After the change to it not being a call in, there is literally no reason to get e8 before a normal sherman unless they already have tanks out, in which case you are pretty fucked regardless and might aswell get a cheaper jackson"

Before I can put any armor on the field, other than the T70, it will cost 210 fuel just to tech to the point where I can field a shitty T-34/76?  And they didn't do shit about the ridiculous instant suppression of the MG42.  Suck my balls Relic!  USF wasn't left out either of the shit-storm either.  The Bulldozer Sherman which is ineffectual against anything but infantry is moved to 2 CP later?  Relic just made that unit worthless."

Just have the T-34/76 be a campaign specific unit, similar to how the early model Panzer IV is a campaign specific unit.   OR   Keep the T-34/76 in the core tech tree, but commanders with the T-34/85 can choose to upgrade their T-34/76 guns with the 85mm with munitions on an individual basis."

Beforr you almost always had to choose between t3 or t4, now you get both. These are big changes that are going to dramatically change the pacing of the game which, with this game specifically, changes the way the game is played.  No more tank rushes. If you try to rush tanks you get steam rolled by light vehicles and infantry. From my experience with these changes, players will have to completely change their strategies."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5lly,ultrasuper3000,3,Tue Jul 14 11:05:57 2015 UTC,Problem is that anti-infantry support for an SU-85 isn't what I want or need. I'd get t34-76 to keep the pressure on from a good early game and use it to push and keep the game mobile. This is something the SU desperately needs against a faction that gets much more powerful later on.
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5lly,iTzDusty,2,Tue Jul 14 11:30:54 2015 UTC,"The T34 costs only 80 fuel now, so building multiple is easier. Ram will make a comeback."

CompanyOfHeroes,3d5lly,cplcarlman,2,Tue Jul 14 07:24:23 2015 UTC,"But you have to build T3 in order to build T4. The overall cost is more. Also, in order to build T34-85's you have to build T3 and T4. The overall cost is more. I know they increased the overall costs of fielding Wehr tanks as well, but the Allied side is the one wI think the clock over their heads requiring them to win the game by a certain point if they don't want to lose to Axis armor. Thus change also delays the Katyusha production which will allow for more Axis blobbing."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5lly,daspoulos,-1,Mon Jul 13 23:13:37 2015 UTC,You act as if only Soviet pays more now. Soviets just got a substantial early - mid game buff. You people are never satisfied.

You also can't punish blobbing with a Katyusha.  But let's face it, this had nothing to do with them wanting to balance the game. They want to kill of the other allied factions so people will buy the Brits."

Cost reduced from 200/80 to 200 / 60""  Nerf? 20 fuel quicker for a Stuart that literally got buffed hugely last patch.  ""Pak Howitzer The Pak Howitzer was currently underperforming for cost we have made a slight adjustment to bring it in line with its performance. Cost reduced from 480 to 380 Changed reinforce cost discount from 1.0 to 0.5 to match existing weapon crews Sherman Easy Eight""  Nerf? You can now build a pair of these things without bleeding, just like LeIGs.  The only thing that has been ""nerfed"" is the cost of the major, yet LITERALLY EVERY OTHER FACTION received the same teching cost increase excluding OKW, which already has delayed tech from the fuel penalty.  Easy Eights are now tied to tech, just like 85s. P47 radius recieved a small adjustment.  All these changes make USF better early and midgame, and all the CP changes for EACH faction make heavy tanks come later.  You need to learn to read before you learn to play."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5lly,cplcarlman,-9,Mon Jul 13 23:03:50 2015 UTC,"First off...kiss my ass.  The Soviet faction is the primary faction that I play and they got raped in this update.  It used to cost 710 manpower and 270 fuel in teching and building costs to field one T34-76.  Now it costs 940 manpower and 290 fuel to do the same.  This is because the T4 building cannot be built without building the T3 building first.  Requiring the T3 building before you can build T4 is, in my opinion, the worst possible consequence of this update.  This affects many other units such as the SU-85 and the Katyusha.    Fielding a Katyusha now also requires a Soviet player to tech all the way up to T4.  Excellent way to reduce blobbing Relic!      Fielding a T34-85, which is a halfway decent tank, requires you to not only build the T1 or T2, but also T3 and T4.  This delays the time  that Soviets get a halfway decent tank that can actually go up against Panthers and P4's.    The Puma call-in had its command point requirement reduced.  Sturm Pioneers now cost less to reinforce and reinforce faster.  Fucking STURM PIONEERS didn't need any sort of a buff.  If you add up all the changes as a whole and don't point out minor changes like a 20 fuel cost reduction for a Captain which is just another shitty unit, you will see that this update has been very detrimental to Soviet faction players."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5lly,iTzDusty,6,Mon Jul 13 23:17:10 2015 UTC,"You are one thick idiot.  Ostheer got the same cost increase for all their teching as well. Everyone's tanks and vehickes come out later, except the t70, much,  and Stuart are now on the field longer before real tanks come out.  Like honestly,  I won't even bother with the rest of your post since you're just a top 10000 shitty player that somehow thinks the captain is shit for being a unit that comes for free from teching and can't acknowledge the 40 manpower bleed of Sturmpios.  Yore shitty enough that's the words soft and hard counter, soft retreat, bleed, and flank are not part of your vocabulary.

You should find some kind of way to market that talent.  Maybe you can be like Miss Cleo or Sylvia Brown.  The captain is a shit unit because it's only real use is to supervise buildings to make production faster.  It's bazookas do little-to-no damage on any units of consequence, unlike the Shrek blobs that roam the fruited plain.    Also, I understood each of the terms in your little vocabulary quiz there, so you can keep on making false assumptions all you want.  (Excellent spelling on the word ""yore"" by the way...very creative.)  All in all, it doesn't really matter what you or I think about the patch.  When the stats come out, it will show how good of a patch it was.  At this point I'm inclined to agree that this patch was released with only one objective...to separate the player-base from their money.

CompanyOfHeroes,3d5lly,tipsy3000,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:03:23 2015 UTC,"the 152 gun is doctrinal and most doctrines that have them get no armor call in's. With it probably still going to be lv 8 or 6 or whatever it is and with the PZ4 becoming a core medium unit, you would have a significant armored advantage over your opponent and would get your armor about the same time he gets the gun. Also the I.G got a cost decrease so just counter barrage the gun. If you go elite armor or breakthrough use the sturmtiger or sector arty to break the gun. Actually I think fortification or salvage also get an arty barrage call-in so just use that too.  I mean its not like its the end of the world, heavy arty is really expensive MP wise, comes late, cant move, and most importantly, its doctrinal.

With the cost reduction it means that you will have two T34-76s for every panther on the field in terms of fuel.  Plus its 80 fuel - use one to ram the panther then follow up with AT guns/Su-76 from afar or use your second one to get behind it.   I think you're over-exaggerating that its useless."

CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,jaded_old_IT_guy,9,Tue Jul 14 01:08:47 2015 UTC,As does all of the larger armor. All factions have their medium/heavy armor come in later. You wont need them till later now
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,abetterthief,5,Tue Jul 14 02:29:51 2015 UTC,You really think a T34-76 stands up to anything else the Axis have on tap at the time you'd be able to build one now?
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,Aneurin,6,Tue Jul 14 02:50:30 2015 UTC,No! But 2 or 3 of the recently cheaper t34s can for sure. Or if you combine them with some su 76s or 85s then they become even more potent. Think combined arms man. I can't believe how many people are poo pooing this change without even trying it
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,abetterthief,3,Tue Jul 14 03:04:24 2015 UTC,"I think the reason for that is because once again allied play especially late game requires a huge amount more micro to win, where as all Germans have to do is turtle and wait for a heavy tank. I am excited for change because it is definitely needed right now, but I am not sure this one will go over well especially in team matches."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,kelton312,2,Tue Jul 14 16:55:22 2015 UTC,Delaying medium/heavy tanks even further like this patch does should penalize the turtle-play.  You'll have lost so many VPs that you may not be able to recover and it could be a one-shot gamble.
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,Lionel-Richie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:39:56 2015 UTC,"I completley agree. Managing one panther is so much easier than trying to get 2 or 3 lesser tanks in for a rear shot, also they have turbo reverse speed and just run back to base and vet"

I just can't visualize what they were going for here, and will have to try it out myself. It completely changes soviet strategies which were supposed to essentially pick one from each of the tiers (if you group t1 & t2 together, and t3 & t4 together)"
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,F1SH_T4C0,4,Tue Jul 14 10:31:47 2015 UTC,"Soviets now have access to ALL their vehicles every game while having even earlier light vehicles. On top of this the t34 is cheaper.

I'm used to either having to spam t34s until they can roll in a pack and rear pen germany heavy armour, or have a large group (I hesitate to say blob) of t0 and t2 infantry + support weapons to screen for su85 and Katyusha  in any event it will be a novel way to play and I'm looking forward to it"

The techs are a little cheaper the buildings cost more and the net effect is more costly.    Wehr t2 isn't that wonderful compared with new soviet t2 or murican cheaper captain.  No vehicle to stand toe to toe with T70s, quad 50s, AA Half tracks, or Stuarts. Wehr has to rely on Pak-40s and Panzergrens until T3 comes around which will take longer.

It came down to two options:   A) a building that can build anti-infantry vehicles  B) a building that can build anti-tank vehicles  There absolutely should have been a middle ground. In the end the Katyusha made the T4 building infinitely more valuable IMO.

CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,EvilTribble,3,Mon Jul 13 23:42:55 2015 UTC,"Seriously, try it in some different strategies. If you think a single  t34 is gonna stop a panther you've got the wrong expectations. Think combined arms. 2 recently cheapened t34s and an su 85 plus some infantry as support can go toe to toe with anything the germans can throw out at the time they time they have enough resources to be built."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,abetterthief,4,Tue Jul 14 00:50:49 2015 UTC,"Everyone seems to be forgetting the recent buff to the SU-76 also. It will reliably penetrate panthers, even with from the front. It's also got a fairly decent rate of fire. You may not even need the SU-85 until you start seeing Tigers and King Tigers come out."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,pintonium,2,Tue Jul 14 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm loving the new SU76, absolutely beastly and it will be more than capable of fulfilling the anti-medium tank role in the T3 slot imo so no problem there.  The problem is if you're going to tech all the way to T4 then what's the use of getting a T34/76 when you have much better heavy AT in the SU85 and better anti-inf or generalist options in the doctrinal tanks. Even with the lowered fuel cost I don't think it'll be worth it, the T34/76 is just lackluster in every department to be coming in that late in the game."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,Ironcl4d,3,Tue Jul 14 19:57:16 2015 UTC,"The reduced cost makes it viable for builds that don't have a call-in. Sure, its a fairly lackluster tank - but its still a medium tank. It can kill any light vehicle and will slow down any infantry push that doesnt have AT with it (or barebones AT). Don't use it on the front line, use it on the flanks and use the numbers to your advantage. You don't always need to form wolf-packs with them. Ram also might start making a comeback, as the cheaper cost makes it less of a loss."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,pintonium,2,Tue Jul 14 20:08:57 2015 UTC,"Who said anything about a single t34? you can make as many as you want they're still not cost effective. they miss infantry squads, they're surprisingly slow and they have horrible penetration. In order to make a t34 you now need to tech both t3 and t4. That's way too much fuel for a tank as bad as the t34-76. maybe slightly better for the t34-85."

CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,iTzDusty,2,Mon Jul 13 23:26:42 2015 UTC,It always had AoE suppression. The problem is the modifier for the non-target squads was only 0.4 so it took more than twice as long to suppress the other nearby troops.

CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,kelton312,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:48:35 2015 UTC,Well to be fair thats on you. Riflenades are pretty easy to spot. If you have bunched up troops engaging a gren squad at range and its your job to position your troops correctly and dodge the riflenade like any other grenade. Only vet 2 was a problem because they could shoot it from so far away. Now there is no excuse.
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,daspoulos,4,Tue Jul 14 16:42:30 2015 UTC,"My problem is not with bunched units, if you do that you deserve to be naded, my problem is with a stationary unit in green cover getting nearly wiped from a rifle nade fired from the front. Like I said previously, it seems like a lot of german players on here and on the forums think this never happens, but it happens to me consistently especially with Maxims being brought down to two models. It just seems like an easy 'make this unit retreat' button that plagues team matches. The vet buff removal definitely will help though and I am glad they are aware of it."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,kelton312,3,Tue Jul 14 16:47:09 2015 UTC,You get 50% Damage reduction from nades in green cover.  You wont lose a squad unless it has already taken considerable per model damage.
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,iTzDusty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:59:30 2015 UTC,"I wish I recorded my last match, I will try to video a few others against a friend to show you are completely wrong. During my match last night I had a FULL health conscript squad, no damage taken, sitting in green cover. I saw the rifle grenade coming, but because the game glitches out sometimes with the keyboard commands, they wouldn't retreat slamming T, so they sat in the green cover and took the grenade right up the bum. And guess what? Instant wipe. My KV2 doesn't even instant wipe full health squads that consistently. All for a measly 25 munitions. I'll make sure to get video footage and see if I can repeat it. Unless during that match rng jesus hated me more than anyone else in coh2 history."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,xXxDOYLExXx,2,Tue Jul 14 21:43:53 2015 UTC,"Mathematically it doesn't happen.  Entities have 80 health. Nades do IIRC 80 or close to it.  If you are sitting in Green cover and take a nade that was thrown or shot directionally FROM the front of the cover, you will not lose a full health squad because the damage is reduced by 50%.  Conveniently you don't have a video or replay, thats great."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d5pua,iTzDusty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:08:23 2015 UTC,"Did some more testing. You are right on some things after watching replays and doing test..at least on latest patch mod. I found out that if taken from front of green cover, it takes it down to 4 conscripts. If not all the men are in green cover, ""like a small cobblestone wall"" for example, and they're bunched it will take it down to 1 man in the squad.   So you can only imagine my testing with slightly hurt squads which is what you fight with 90% of the time (Meaning they will at least take a few rifle hits before the nade)  I think what happened to me is I had a full health squad ""Partially"" meaning not the full squad was sitting in green cover, then they did get one shot off to finish my squad as soon as the grenade hit thus wiping them. Still not balanced imo.  For balance sakes they should make the rifle grenade shoot far and even faster BUT add a timer to it like the Rear Echelon grenades. So the perk to the grenade is range, instead of a insta squad wipe button for the most part.. Typically if you are micro'ing another unit you can hear the ""grenade!"" over the audio with other factions, but by the time you see them they are dead with no chance to move with rifle grenades. At least other factions if you hear it, you can move them if your fast and good enough imo because of the as it hits the ground like the Rear Echelon."

Yes, you don't use it for the dammage primarily.  However, dammage is always a plus.   The alpha dammage of the .50 cal is 4 times more than an MG42!  Its accuracy is actually not bad, 0.4 far compared to a grenadiers 0.52  Yes, it is offset by MG42's RoF, but what you are essentially getting, is a automatic grenadier bullet dispenser plus suppression.    If it was allowed to hole up in buildings early game, to which the okw doesn't have much of a counter to buildings early game, unlike the smoke and molotovs the USSR and US get, the cone of fire would be extremely deadly to the vet 0 base troops the okw receive."

This ^       I think I only get the USF MG when there is a good building or really well placed cover. It just seems to get killed too easily, and doesn't suppress or kill quite quick enough. Part of this might be that the OKW and especially Wehr tend to have a few good units in the early game, which are better countered by other units in Lieut tier. If the USF MG was available from the start of the game, you bet people would build more of them. But as it is, there are just other really good units like the m20."

CompanyOfHeroes,3d559x,TehBrownSheep,9,Mon Jul 13 16:35:09 2015 UTC,"I think its easier to counter as SU but here is my take for USF.   Your only hard counter to getting pinned instantly will be setting up an AA half-track. This is costly and mainly ineffective. Infantry strafe pin isn't unlocked until 6 cmd points. This should give you ample time to get up a major/ambulance and set a forward retreat point. You are going to get pinned, use a forward retreat point to quickly get out of, and then back into battle.   Anti Tank Strafe is also a nuisance, you will need good micro to make sure you are moving your tanks immediately. Never keep them next to each other when they are out of battle or repairing.  When you hear the stuka bomb assume its going to your ambulance and major. Retreat all units. Move your units first then your ambulance. The bomb will deliver much more dmg to infantry than your ambulance. Just retreat then re-set up.   The key to winning the infantry battle is smoke. LMG grens want to use distance to their advantage. Upgrade your rifleman with bars or flames - use your smoke to get up right in their faces. Do not take unnecessary losses, he will try and MP bleed you. Either use smoke and attack or avoid your opponent. Sending 1 rifle squad against 2-3 LMG grens is a waste of time and MP - don't do it.   Rush light vehicles - either m20 or Stuart. He will be converting fuel to ammo so basically you should only be worrying about a pak/fauts/pgrens. Use your light vehicles to wipe and burn as much MP as possible.   Rush a sherman, use your AI rounds and harass, wipe, repeat. Use sherman smoke as an aggressive ability, not a defense mechanism. Locate his pak, shoot your sherman smoke at pak, harass and wipe.   You should have an overall aggressive approach, constantly applying pressure to his weak areas."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d559x,Gdott,4,Mon Jul 13 17:15:30 2015 UTC,"I think this is a good post, except that you advocate rushing both Stuart and Sherman. I would advocate rushing the Sherman after LT tech; it's much faster than what you're suggesting, and provides (IMO) much better map control."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d559x,essenceofreddit,2,Mon Jul 13 19:51:14 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with this statement. The big overall theme conveyed here that is correct is be aggressive as possible. If you're attempting a quick tech to Sherman I'd advise not going captain, and definitely not getting a Stuart (although I do agree a quick tech to Sherman is a good game plan against CAS). If he is gren blobbing, definitely get the flaktrack, it punishes that tactic HARD. If he's mixing grens with support weapons, probably settle for the M20, place a few mines down just in case he isn't going too heavy on muni conversion. Mg42 AP rounds will turn the flaktrack into dust before you can even begin accelerating away (the M20 at least has smoke to get away).   One unorthodox tactic seldom used against CAS is have your major trail just behind your main force. He insta-pins your troops just retreat them back 5 feet to the major and then you're back in business. If you're airborne have a pathfinders squad with the major to drop a beacon so you can even reinforce paratroopers when they retreat just a few feet back. Heck, even flaunt your major in a firefight as axis players go NUTS trying to kill him first since they figure he's so important and is your retreat point. Truth is, he is only 200mp to buy again (no fuel the 2nd time), just 40mp more than a RE squad; so a very expendable unit if you think drawing away their fire will win you the fight. And when he hits vet3 he turns into the troll king. Place him at the edge of a contested territory and lock it down and watch as your enemy goes crazy not understanding why they cant cap the point (been called a cheater before saying I've hacked the game so he couldn't cap points lol)"
CompanyOfHeroes,3d559x,CynicalShadow,7,Tue Jul 14 09:13:40 2015 UTC,"You can't counter it per se, but just mitigate it's effects. Having AA means that the plane will just crash on your units as single pass strafe planes are uncounterable. Don't bother.    If you have smoke, use it on your units so you recover faster from pinned state or put them in cover. Do not retreat after a pin strafe, if there is no enemy nearby. Don't panic and see if you can recover from it.  After a recon plane, ABSOLUTELY move your tanks and mobile artilleries. NEVER mass retreat unless you want a recon + stuka on your units   On 1v1 is manegable, but further you add players it gets worst and worst. On teamgames modes, it puts a huge micro tax on the allies players at the expense of a low skill high reward abilities. Whenever theres a huge engagements going on, it's easy to target artillery or units in base.  It's key to analyse if you are facing someone who is using conversion early on or not. This puts a big clock on you to put pressure with fuel units such as the AAHT/Stuart/Sherman."

CompanyOfHeroes,3d559x,Chukonoku,3,Mon Jul 13 17:59:14 2015 UTC,"With infantry best you can do is try to split them up in different directions and/or into cover. CAS Strafe has a really big AoE but you can sorta dodge it, just don't move everyone in the same direction and some should be OK. Cover will help you recover from suppressed/pinned much faster.  Similar logic for the AT strafe. Also, avoid showing rear armor to the plane, will help save shermans at least.  As for bombing you major or base retreat points, you must simply be aware of these things. If you're getting caught unaware... pay more attention to the sounds. Once you hear that dive bomb coming assess where you think it's going to hit and MOVE. Retreating is an option for blobs in the field, but it's not all that much better. If the enemy is timing their attack to hit your retreating troops when they arrive... Ouch. At least with the major you can cancel the retreat point and redirect to base. If it's headed for base... compliment your opponent and cry a little on the inside...   Another good thing to do vs the bomb is to spread your troops slightly post retreating and while reinforcing/healing. Takes some getting used to, but can quickly become a habit."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d559x,thefonztm,3,Mon Jul 13 17:11:36 2015 UTC,"A vet 1 captain with his ""On me!"" ability will counter the effects of the strafe. Just make sure not to lose him.   The Stuka AT run is quite strong, but for the most case if you're fast enough you should be able to avoid it.  The big bomb is the same. You have about....5-6 seconds? I think? From the moment you start hearing the noise to when the bomb dromps. That SHOULD be enough time for you to move your units or retreat all of the.  I agree that CAS is annoying as hell to play against. In 1v1 it's not that bad, in 2v2 it's an absolute nightmare.  I wouldn't bother getting out a flak HT. It only shoots down the planes after they drop their payload usually. It'll take out the recon run but again, normally after it's done its job."

The thing that makes COH2 players so angry is you cap that off with poor in game balance, and a fuck ton of RNG, so things often feel out of the player's hands, and they vent that.  For me, I don't rage at people, but I get salty because the game has so much potential but the developers seem more intent on their own view of the game than player feedback.   COH2 is still miles behind COH1 & DOW2 in terms of balance and polish, and considering how long it's been out that's pretty appalling."

Put it in a commander (with no other abilities) cries of P2W and killing build diversity.  Put it in the main tech tree and youll have a faction with the best early game inf + the best Tank Destroyer + an (at least) average tank destroyer.

Sure you'll have some USF players trying to rush it, but they won't have any Jacksons or Shermans fielded to try and handle the new revamped German medium armor stage, and I'm sure no matter how crazy they could make the Pershing, a well micro'd Panther would be able to give it a run for its money."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d4yfx,Solliid,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:10:35 2015 UTC,"They could put in multiple commanders like the ISU152 is for the Soviets.    Maybe they could require 14 or 15 command points to unlock it, but make it a superior tank to all others. That way the Axis side will know what a time crunch feels like.   For instance,  prior to the last couple patches if an Allied player complained about late-game Axis armor he would get berated for having shitty skills for not ending the game by the 10 minute mark. With the Pershing coming out later, but being superior to Axis armor we could berate them for letting the game get past the 30 or 40 minute mark."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d4yfx,cplcarlman,6,Mon Jul 13 18:04:18 2015 UTC,Ha!  Look at you guys looking for realism in the game where a Puma can go 1v1 with a T34 and Kubels usually take more than one hit from a Zis to die.
CompanyOfHeroes,3d4yfx,cplcarlman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:01:00 2015 UTC,"We have seen pictures of a T70 taking out a Panther here on this very sub, technically a Puma could easily take out a T34 in the same situation.  And the fact that almost no unit (except for the Katyusha and Panzerwerfer IIRC) dies in one hit by standard (except Grenadiere vs. Shermans) is due to balance and unit design. Imagine how much hate there would be if a Panzer IV could take out your Jackson in one hit?  Edit: Wow, this subreddit never ceases to amaze me. I haven't even argued against his point (and just for the record: I don't care whether the Pershing was better or worse than its German counterparts, relevant to this game is only balance). The hate is strong with these people."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d4yfx,Mandarion,5,Mon Jul 13 19:27:11 2015 UTC,"You're making my point exactly.  Can you imagine the uproar if in-game a T70 could take out a Panther 1v1?  What I'm saying is that just because something happened in real-life, the game design doesn't have to be bound by that happening.    Allied armor in the late game currently sucks when compared to Axis armor.  I don't care that the Pershing was inferior to Axis armor.  I would like for the Allies (especially the USF) to have some chance to stand toe-to-toe with Axis armor.  Currently once the game gets into the heavy armor phase especially in 3v3 and 4v4 games (which are the most common game type played) Allied players have to massively out-play their Axis opponents to have a chance to win.  The Axis have better AT guns, better hand-held AT, and better tanks.  And I don't need to hear that crap about the game being balanced for 1v1 games.  I don't give a shit about 1v1 games and neither does the majority of the player base."

CompanyOfHeroes,3d4yfx,Tetracyclon,3,Mon Jul 13 22:19:27 2015 UTC,Now we just need a super pershing as equivalent to tiger ace...
CompanyOfHeroes,3d4yfx,LiamNL,2,Mon Jul 13 22:33:08 2015 UTC,Yeah because addtional armorplating and a larger gun equals experience...
CompanyOfHeroes,3d4yfx,Tetracyclon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:11:44 2015 UTC,"Then don't make experience the special feature! The extra armor and higher penetration gun are enough to separate it from the standard Pershing and at the same time provide a counterpart to the Tiger Ace, with a slightly different flavor.  And ingame have the Vet 0 Super Pershing be less dangerous than a Tiger Ace but as it gains experience have it become even more deadly than the Ace. This would even make sense because the Super Pershing was for testing (meaning they didn't know how to use properly at the beginning of it's deployment.)"
CompanyOfHeroes,3d4yfx,SD0S,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:28:08 2015 UTC,You know that the Pershing itself was stronger than a Tiger and you want to tell me a Pershing on steroids would be the balance to a Vet3 Tiger? That makes no sense!
CompanyOfHeroes,3d4yfx,Tetracyclon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:45:14 2015 UTC,"I've always heard that the Pershing was more equivalent to the Panther. Less armor than a Tiger, but still durable and relatively mobile. It was even reclassified as a medium tank after the war ended.  Due to it's status as the only heavy tank for the USF, meaning that it will be used as a damage sponge, the Pershing would be less effective in it's role compared to the Tiger.  In a one-on-one engagement, the Pershing would either loose to a Tiger frontally or live by just a smidgen of health if it managed to flank around the sides of rear.  In my mind the ordering goes:   Panther < Pershing < Tiger < SuperPershing Vet 0 < Tiger Ace <  SuperPershing Vet 3 < King Tiger/Jagdtiger/Elephant  The Super Pershing rectifies the armor of the Pershing and gets a better gun, hence beating the normal Tiger, however the Tiger Ace has Target Weakpoint, allowing it to beat the Vet 0 Super Pershing. The Super Pershing then gains veterancy and can outperform the Tiger Ace (but this takes time because the Super Pershing has to gain veterancy while the Tiger Ace comes out strong and stays strong.) And of course no matter what the Super Pershing Vet 3 can't match the power of the super-heavy tanks.  The Wehrmacht gets pretty of time with more powerful units, and it's only after a significant amount of time that the USF gets a better tank than the Whermacht. This gives an incentive to do something other than Jackson spam late game and gives the USF a force that can take punishment much like the Panther-Tiger combos in late game.  The balancing mechanic here is that the Super Pershing could be a call-in tank, but instead of a resource drop  and in a fashion similar to COH 1, you would only be able to call in one per game. This would mean you have to pay for it outright (limiting it to the late-game), and it would need to be cared for because if you lose it, it's gone forever. The payoff it that if someone can keep it alive long enough it can become an extremely dangerous tank that can take punishment and deal damage. However it is one tank, can be flanked, and due to the extra armor it would be slow to respond or retreat."
CompanyOfHeroes,3d4yfx,SD0S,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:46:05 2015 UTC,"But you should know that the Panther was better than the Tiger. It had 20 mm   less armor in front (80 mm) but angled in 45° which gives around 134mm vs the 100mm of the Tiger. The Panther gun was longer had more penetration and the aiming system was a way more further developed. Because it had less weight and the same engine as the Tiger it was faster.  Btw there was only one SuperPershing in European Theater which has never seen any confirmed encounter. While so many got mad at the Sturmtiger with 18 pieces build and encounters which were filmed. The Superpershing is as tank as legendary as the Panther Ausf.F.  Btw ingame the jackson is good, maybe even better than a Panther/tiger you know how to use it."

There are NO pictures of﻿ this phantom King Tiger at Dessau. No unit ID. Not even a tank number.

CompanyOfHeroes,3d0arc,thefonztm,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:15:52 2015 UTC,"I think they are just a big issue when you are in full cover and the way the map is or the location of the cover, it causes your troops to huddle up real close so if your not paying attention, the ""squad wipe"" happens.  I've had that a few times on both ends only as or against USF nades.  I have also had just as many times where my nade didn't do shit so I don't bitch about grenades as much. It's a commitment to fuel and MP earlier on for USF which mean less opportunity to tech up faster."

Forces you to cancel the grenade throw by moving the unit, and then throwing it again.  It's really bad when you're suppressed and crawling towards an mg to throw the grenade, when it happens and you don't have enough time to cancel and throw it again before your squad is pinned."

Orginaly it would have 3 stars on the face plate to tell you the prestige but they have since then removed it to make it less common for people to drop.  The real issue is that match making doesn't give you an overall ELO like it does in Dota or LoL, so you'll get prestige 3 vs total noobs because the older player is searching with his friends.  They just worked on the leaderboards and I'm sure its on a long list of things for them to do, Cynthia was already talking about it during her live stream yesterday 7/10/15 about the long list of things the dev team is working on including ingame leaderboards and stats.

CompanyOfHeroes,3cyuwh,rshunter313,3,Sun Jul 12 02:38:16 2015 UTC,"I think you are a bit confused.   While they removed the level prestige during the loadout screen, you can access it during the match while looking at the players nickname. Although, as in the past, it's only the prestige levels and not the ELO level.  WE HAVE an ELO ranking, which you can access either through coh2org or their official leaderboard but not ingame. You either install CELO or look for it manually at the end of the game using their steam ID.  WHAT OP is asking for, is that this ELO rank is shown ingame."

CompanyOfHeroes,3cxvpp,Tomakaze,13,Sat Jul 11 19:33:03 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about this. & I think I have a potential modification without making the power of the commander irrelevant. I think munitions transfer should be executed like the Soviet lend-lease munitions to fuel transfer. If a plane came and dropped munitions, then it not only able to be shot down, but would be subject to a delay. I don't play a lot of a sphere, but I noticed when I watch streamers using close air support there you will be in battle and transfer munitions in time for a clutch grenade, for infantry strafe. Fuel to munitions transfer shouldn't be as effective as it is as an oshit Band Aid. It should require more planning and skill."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cxvpp,cradledcat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"This is certainly an interesting idea.  It is a ""live by the sword, die by the sword"" mentality.  I can't use lend-lease against OKW because their base emplacements shoot down the supply planes (and on some maps, 100% it is shot down). Even if the plane idea doesn't work out, maybe it could be a time thing where over the course of 1 min, your fuel income is drastically lowered and the muni is increased."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cxvpp,EvilTribble,5,Sun Jul 12 19:42:52 2015 UTC,"Skill planes are OP even individually, the abilities are too good because they're undercosted and the suppression range is obscene, and ostheer with infinite munitions is good by itself. fixing it with just cooldowns will just make playing it less timing dependent (since you're just removing options) and doesn't stop entire armies from being instant pinned every N minutes.  Its the same problem as the Stug E, they ""fixed"" it by slowing down the fire rate, the problem was that it kills 2 models per shot, not that it fires to fast.  Relic's track record in fixing completely broken commanders is pretty dismal, don't expect too much."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cxvpp,Tetracyclon,0,Sat Jul 11 19:55:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah and when we are there, they could also nerf the Airborne Company. The P-47 Strike sweeps tanks from the map for a riddicolous amout of munitions. You cry about strafes that cost 110, 130 and 180 that are one run in a small area while for 240 ammo 2 planes are going for a game of seek and destroy on the half map. The Ost Strafe is a skill shot while the USF one is aiming anywhere the planes will find them no matter where they hide.   ImO balanced as other Doctrines."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cxvpp,Mandarion,7,Sun Jul 12 00:06:03 2015 UTC,"First of all, the strafes cost 60 (AI), 110 (AT), and 160 (Stuka).  Second, just the CAS doctrine uses single strafes, the rest that have AI and AT strafes cost 120 and 240 respectively and loiter in the same manner as the P-47s.  In fact, the 240 muni AT strafe is pretty much on par with the P-47s in terms of damage and, I would argue, more reliable.  Nobody uses them because those commanders are simply not used that much.  Specifically with the CAS doctrine, these strafes may not be initially affordable, but one click of the muni transfer and they are all available whereas the muni spent for P-47s is a big investment and after 2 WILL drain your muni reserves especially if you use any other abilities.   The P-47s are strong, but I don't think your claim that it is ""balanced as other Doctrines"" is very strong."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cxvpp,Kubelecer,3,Sun Jul 12 01:32:40 2015 UTC,"I agree, the P47s are mostly okay. My biggest gripe with them is their range, because especially on smaller maps you can drop this big turd in the middle of the map, and the planes will attack the enemy even in their base…"

CompanyOfHeroes,3cxvpp,HauntedGrass,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:16:54 2015 UTC,"Dunno but if the P-47 is not stopped, they go for 3(?) runs? And each of them are strong enough to kill a medium tank. That equals 6 Strafes for me. The fuel to munitions is a pretty cost thing, i mean 50 fuel thats half a StugG and you can use its only in late really heavy if you don't lose your tanks. One could argue that Pgrens are a good subtitution for tanks but with the shrecknerfs and the HMG buffs, they are not.  But now that i tought about it i like this idea. But also for the P-47."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cxvpp,rshunter313,5,Sun Jul 12 12:31:53 2015 UTC,I completely agree. You shouldn't be able to suppress troops in their own base and then drop a bomb on them.
CompanyOfHeroes,3cxvpp,Tetracyclon,7,Sat Jul 11 19:44:04 2015 UTC,"Its been a battle since the Commander went mainstream. The last patch did a lot of AA changes to hopefully fix it but its still a pretty broken commander. They have a lot of options they could try to make the commander more fair such as make the munitransfer a passive, increase cooldowns, and even allow planes  to be shot at even when off map.  Rather than do the shared cool downs just a simple increase in time required for another stuka dive bomb or CAS AT strafe would go a long way to make this a more fair commander"

CompanyOfHeroes,3cxvpp,Darklingwanders,3,Sun Jul 12 00:07:28 2015 UTC,"I think shooting one of the planes down with an AA unit should increase the cool down for all of the abilities.   If you've gone with an air support heavy commander, anti air units should be your prime targets, shouldn't it?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3cxvpp,Grimauldus14,3,Sat Jul 11 23:58:51 2015 UTC,"All they really need to do is make it so that the AI strafe pins ALL infantry in its AOE, not just enemy.

CompanyOfHeroes,3cxvpp,24CharacterLimit,-2,Sun Jul 12 11:50:36 2015 UTC,"I think calling it unstoppable is a little bit naive. Sure if angled well the strafes come out very quickly from the sides of the map. Sure the cooldowns are pretty short for multiple potentially heavy hitting abilities. Yes CAS can take over a game if the player using hits his targets and builds a good unit composition. But no, the strafes can be planned for with an ounce of forethought, and with some thoughtful unit composition choices pzgren shrek spam can be turned into free AT from squad wipes and drops.   While it may be more common now, small amounts of forward thinking can deal with it reasonably effectively.   Come key points of the game, play the center of the map with main armor forces and use sparing infantry there to follow up cap, with spread infantry capping the edges from the void created. With this sort of play you can position armor of all sorts such that any angle the AT strafe comes through unless you have poor macromanagement you will have time to spot that smoke and move. Further, with very little grouped infantry suppression strafe becomes very tough to use effectively.   Holy cannoli don't commander into on map arty. Sure, you want to pick your commander early, but damn can you wait a couple minutes to see if, hey that guy has CAS in his loadout during loading, and CAS is near always going to lock into that shit as early as possible, maybe I should wait up to not pick a commander whose primary strength is hard countered by it.   I understand it is strong, and most players tend to have preconceived notions of what their builds will be prior to a game, but making strong strategic choices that open up tactical choices is what this game is about. It is not like there are zero allied commanders that axis need to fully rethink a gameplan around. Sure they may be a little less impactful maybe, but when I go into a load and see something that may pigeonhole my opponent in the same way CAS does, I take that as a potential advantage not a ""MOM that guy has better toys than me, tell his mom to tear off his transformers leg""  Idk, a little bit flamey but maybe something useful came out of this rant. It could use some sort of change, but not sure if cooldowns are the best way to run it even if they thematically make sense. Maybe shorter length of fire during the strafe based on how close to the edge of the map it was called from."

CompanyOfHeroes,3d081z,Nefarioz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:58:15 2015 UTC,There is a game on steam called ''1914-1918 Battle of empires'' thats a RTS set during ww1. it doesnt play like CoH Though since it uses the same engine Men of war is made on. alot of nice realism though. might want to give it a shot if you hunger for a WW1 game.
CompanyOfHeroes,3d081z,Nefarioz,2,Sun Jul 12 18:40:31 2015 UTC,There is a mod for vCoH on steam i think that is WW1. In terms of a new full game though i rather have Relic do Vietnam for example or WW2 again. The style CoH plays doesnt feel suited for a WW1 setting. There are still plenty of theaters of war Relic could do during WW2. I would go as far as to say that even a modern conflict would be a potential CoH3 Idea.

The thing that matters is mmr and it's hidden from the player. You have mmr for every faction and type of game (1v1, 2v2, etc).  They just added official leaderboards on the official website where you can find your actual rank.

CompanyOfHeroes,3cvhdw,wingedreturn,5,Sat Jul 11 02:55:30 2015 UTC,"A basic 3 conscript opening is always good, gives plenty of capping power and allows for aggressive flanking maneuvers. A good general tip as both allied factions is to be mobile and be aggressive. Do not expect to win by mg and mortar camping as the Soviets.   I played a 2v2 today where, I shit you not, my Soviet teammate built nothing but mgs and mortars. His only infantry units were 1 engineer and 1 unit of shock troops. He then got mad at the fact that he couldn't hold a victory point and his weapon crews were constantly getting killed."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cvhdw,notabrahamlincoln,3,Sat Jul 11 04:31:47 2015 UTC,Conscripts are amazing infantry units with great utility. My early game build (1v1) is generally:  2x Conscript  Molotov (if vs. Wehr to kill MG crews) or AT nade (if vs. OKW to kill Kubelwagen)  1x Conscript  Field Infirmary   1x Conscript  Then supplement as needed with support weapons. Flank MGs with at least 2 conscripts on both sides of the MG cone of fire and oorah.
CompanyOfHeroes,3cvhdw,trineroks,2,Sat Jul 11 04:39:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't get molotovs at 3, especially on some maps.  If I have to deal with garrisons, I feel your first 60 muni should go to the flamethrower on your engineers rather than molotovs.    I will sometimes do 4x Cons to Field Infirmary to tier 2.  There you decide on at or mg or both, then you go to the next tier be it 3 or 4.  Molotovs are great cover denial to be sure tho, even if they take forever to toss."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cvhdw,Tomakaze,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:13:21 2015 UTC,"I haven't really tried Molotov just yet, but are they easy to anticipate and dodge? Like the American grenades in CoH1?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3cvhdw,trineroks,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:43:22 2015 UTC,"You generally don't want to use your molotovs on highly mobile enemies like regular infantry squads - you use them to dislodge crew weapons like the MG42 since it takes ages for them to set up / pack up.   Heck, you don't necessarily even need to throw a molly to dislodge crew weapons. The very sight of conscripts getting up close to a crew weapon will scare an attentive opponent who will probably pack up the weapon and pull it back."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cvhdw,Mandarion,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:54:26 2015 UTC,"And on buildings. People tend to forget that aiming matters if you throw a grenade into buildings, and that goes double for molotovs."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cvhdw,MolotovFromHell,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:40:34 2015 UTC,Molotov is the best thing you can get in early game especially now since the ost mg is so powerful. Early game literally gets decided If you get in Molotov range to an mg42.  You absolutely must use it vs mg42 crews at which point they either have to move away which gives you time to shoot at the crew and maybe steal it or they have to retreat. Either way they will take damage because of the set up time.  It also works vs mobile squads although it takes practice. It is an area denial tool. For 10 muni you send them out of green cover and make them move all the while your other models in the squad are shooting at max accuracy while their carbine squads have to take a 50% accuracy penalty while moving or stop in place without cover.  Either way you just gained the upper hand even without doing damage because Molotov is not about doing damage its about denial. Unless they react slowly or get a flame crit at which point it does damage as well.  And all this for 10 muni.  Just get it and learn it it will serve you well.
CompanyOfHeroes,3cvhdw,Crysack,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:01:57 2015 UTC,"What are some early game skirmish results (Conscript/Engineer vs Pioneer/Grenadier)? I know micro and cover are most important, but generally speaking, which would be the superior units?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3cvhdw,TrystonG33K,2,Sat Jul 11 05:42:40 2015 UTC,"You answered your own question. Micro and cover determine the outcome 90% of the time (i.e. if one unit is in green cover and the other is in yellow or red, the latter will pretty much always lose). That being said, each unit also has a range that it tends to be better at. Assuming equal cover, vanilla Cons will beat vanilla Grens at close-medium range, while Grens will usually win out at maximum range (contingent upon RNG). RU engis, on the other hand, will beat Pios at medium-long range while Pios will win up close (obviously, since they have SMGs)."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cvhdw,COH-CIV-TW,2,Sat Jul 11 06:27:16 2015 UTC,"To elaborate on gren vs. Con a little bit. A single Grenadier is just straight up.more accurate than a conscript. Conscripts strength is in their larger squad size. The reason they tend to win in close quarters is thst they have more guns firing, and accuracy doesn't matter that close up. If you only have four conscripts left in your squad and you rush a full health gren squad, you will lose those cons most likely. Your infantry needs to use its health advantage to win."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cvhdw,COH-CIV-TW,0,Sat Jul 11 13:09:38 2015 UTC,I had a game where my soviet teammate built all 4 tiers.  Built T1 and immediately makes a conscript...okay  Builds 1 penal and a sniper. Loses the sniper in like 2 minutes  Builds T2 and gets AT out.  Builds T3 and gets T34  Builds T4 and builds another T34  ...wtf?! This guy was somewhere bordering on semi retarded and complete fucking noob who should've played AI first.
CompanyOfHeroes,3cvhdw,UnhopefulRomantic,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:28:16 2015 UTC,Hah I guess you could still defeat atleast a Hard AI w/ something like that. I have seen a lot of players who don't play specific builds though. You obviously need to make some changes based on how your opponent is playing but still need some framework I guess
CompanyOfHeroes,3cvhdw,UnhopefulRomantic,0,Mon Jul 13 13:01:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah definately. And honestly, I don't think this kid could've beaten hard ai.   I actually just had an expert match played I was soviet facing ostheer, and I forget the name of the map but it has two cutoff points on each side with a forest on one side an a lake on the end (I just play the maps, i don't pay attention to the names, Level 94 with 260 hours and I still don't know them).  Anyway, i was using advanced warfare tactics and literally the fricken ai was steamrolling me. He was holding both my cutoffs and had 1 p4 out. Luckily with the commander I had radio intercept so I got a AT gun out and then another immediately afterward. This is when the battle started to turn in my favor because I protected those AT guns like none other and took out his now 2 p4s and 1 stug. I was gonna go T3 but then i had enough cp for 34/85 so i got that instead. Pretty much I one because the ai was too aggressive with its cheating bullshit trying to attack my at guns with flam engineers and p4s when i have infantry backing them all up.  I hate expert because its not difficult, its just bullshit. They automatically get like 30-40 fuel at least late-early-game so they'll have a p4 out before you can even get your t3 built."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cvhdw,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,3,Mon Jul 13 13:24:33 2015 UTC,Lots of conscripts. Honestly lol I tend to have 3 or 4 at all times. It's great. Keep them alive and they can be excellent harassment and meat shields for other units. Lately with the viability of light armour I've been pumping out early SU76s with some AT backup.
CompanyOfHeroes,3cvhdw,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:19:35 2015 UTC,Are 3-4 squads really considered a lot? I have started doing a C C C E C opening and it seems to be ideal. Though I guess that is because I tend to skip T1 almost everytime.

CompanyOfHeroes,3csq3d,wingedreturn,5,Mon Jul 13 13:11:20 2015 UTC,"The game feels quite balanced for 1v1s. Team games, on the other hand, are an exercise in frustration for Allies. The enormous gap in effectiveness between the MG42 and the Maxim really starts to show when you have 2+ players running around the field with big blobs."
CompanyOfHeroes,3csq3d,Crysack,10,Fri Jul 10 17:12:08 2015 UTC,"I mainly play team games, as allies. Pre-patch I felt playing Allies was always quite stressful, since in order to beat Germans in team games you had to outplay them a lot. Post patch it's become too stressful to play. The only way I really win is to cheese or spam, since the Germans spam MG-42's or Blob Grens like there is no tomorrow. I feel the game would be a lot better for team games if OKW didn't have such a huge power spike in the mid game. They pop out 3-4 squads of Rocket troops and all allied tanks are instantly dead to a volley or two, and you're forced to tech into Rifleman upgrades to try and out blob them. I only really feel like I'll win if the Axis team misplay, rather than if I outplay them.   I will give them credit that units feel more viable now, but the SU-76 and Stug buffs went a little too far. I can easily out micro a Panther with a single Su- 76 and kill it, and vice versa German players only need a single Stugg to take out an Easy8. If you play team games the USSR are by far the best choice, the US forces just don't compete in the mid-late game, and I've found myself spamming Wolverines, which seem to be more cost effective than Shermans, Jacksons or Easy8's.  It's interesting that they try to balance the game for 1v1s yet the graphs show more people play 4v4 than any other game mode.   The cynical me says they made the Axis stronger this patch to prepare for the fact that the British are coming out, since we know this was all lumped together on the Alpha. I guess that's fine, I just would have liked them to have held of this patch until then.   As for the occasional 1v1/2v2 I play, I feel the game is fairly balanced here, I have much more success with Allies and feel it's a lot more down to personal skill than other factors. I'm actually enjoying these games quite a bit."
CompanyOfHeroes,3csq3d,Atrixer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:27:42 2015 UTC,"I agree. Everyone says that 4v4 balance doesn't matter, that it is meaningless. It is not. 3v3 and 4v4 should be just as balanced as 1v1. It's good game design, and the fact that relic has been unable to balance it is pathetic.  Look at a game like DoW2. When I was playing it, I always felt that it was pretty damn well balanced for the most part. This is a game with 6 factions, all with unique vehicles, abilities, commanders, etc. Yet it was decently well balanced. Relic is working with not only less units, but less factions in this game yet they still have such a hard time balancing it.   I for one cannot wait for Brits. I feel it will make 4v4 swing in favor of allied teams hopefully."
CompanyOfHeroes,3csq3d,FlyingSMonster,3,Fri Jul 10 23:32:13 2015 UTC,More units are viable so that's nice.
CompanyOfHeroes,3csq3d,Account_Eliminator,2,Fri Jul 10 13:56:47 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I need to play more Sov for SU-76 action. Right now I'm trying to nail down a build for Whermact. Reviving this idea as a T1->T2->T3 build. New Stug G gives me great mobile AT supported by riegels."
CompanyOfHeroes,3csq3d,HauntedGrass,4,Fri Jul 10 14:07:02 2015 UTC,"I mostly like it. I most play as allies, so german MGs can get pretty frustrating, but I like the rest of the patch.

CompanyOfHeroes,3csq3d,COH-CIV-TW,3,Sat Jul 11 21:20:35 2015 UTC,"Whermact - Loving the new Stug G. Fits very well into a T1->T3 build, both as an answer to light vehicles on the field and as a stop gap if the enemy has a fuel advantage.  Main gun criticals - They've really shooken up the 'all-in' tank dives. Not sure if I feel bad for the kubel though, seems to crit very easily due to the sheer number of shots infantry can put at it. Been seeing suppressed squads wittle it down to 25% (started wounded) and then crit the main gun...  Engine criticals - Really love that they get repaired at 75% HP now. It's a soft change with a big impact. Hard to describe... but you get these moments where you need the vehicle moving at full speed far more than you need it at full health."
CompanyOfHeroes,3csq3d,befree4ever,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:00:28 2015 UTC,I actually thought the kubel change was somewhat nice so that you didn't have to make that your entire focus early game when facing OKW. If you commited to t1 as soviets or didn't go lieutenant it could sometimes be a tough counter early on unless you just spammed at it. Now early kubels arent as incredible as they used to be.  If I ever go early kubel it usually depends on the map and i always suppress and take them out with my 1 sturmpio. If I have the early game advantage I get a second out immediately to just suppress and shred infantry.

Good things about the patch: I like how Guard Motor was nerfed and that heavies were reduced.  I like the buffed Stuart and Stug although I think the new Stug is just a little bit much.  No more precision strike, that is good.  I also like the engine crit changes.  Overall there were a lot of good changes but the few nonsensical bits really messed up playing Allies."

Except the 120mm mortar damage reduction...that made no sense.  Glad to see precision strike gone.  I'm digging the lower tier armor that is more common now."
CompanyOfHeroes,3csq3d,Tetracyclon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:01:25 2015 UTC,MGs are too powerful. Even a multi-squad pincer attack can get halted with ease.   Thank god precision fire is removed from USSR mortars though. That was seriously one of the most OP abilities this game has ever seen.
CompanyOfHeroes,3csq3d,Tomakaze,0,Sun Jul 12 07:16:34 2015 UTC,"The Tiger Ace is now a pretty beast! I like that Wehrmacht is now using a lot of Pz4 and even the OKW Pz4-J are now very good! Soviets got a little op with Soviet Industry swarming the map with T-34 like there is no tomorrow. USF are now pretty strong since nothing can stand up against a battleline of jacksons. HMG are well balanced, flanking them is now trickier but not too hard."
CompanyOfHeroes,3csq3d,Tetracyclon,2,Fri Jul 10 17:28:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with the Elite Troops Doctrine being one of if not the best commander in the Ostheer arsenal.  Soviet Industry hasn't been OP since its nerf a year ago.  Nothing has changed about it.  It still allows Soviet players to field quick and early armor at the expense of manpower sustainability (Their losses are much more costly than any other commander or situation).  It is not like before the patch you could counter them with Tiger call ins.  So I got a good laugh out of that statement. In fact I would go so far as to say that it is a touch weaker with the Stug III G getting the AT buff.  I understand that simply fausting a t-34 will no longer insta damage the engine, but I have always felt that too many players sacrifice way too much just to faust or nade something often losing squads.  (It is even worse when done to USF)  As for the USF, maybe they are better late game since they will only ever have to deal with 1 heavy at a time.  Their early game for the most part is still very bland and predictable and many maps will give the  buffed MG42s an edge to the Ostheer now."

CompanyOfHeroes,3ctkjj,SilverCurve,2,Fri Jul 10 17:56:42 2015 UTC,The small number of players is still a problem. If you play as allies in 4vs4 the chance you get teamed with afkers is too high.
CompanyOfHeroes,3ctkjj,HauntedGrass,3,Fri Jul 10 18:34:44 2015 UTC,"For 2) I used to play 3v3 and 4v4 mostly. Then came the patch and I lost almost every match. I can't deal with these OP MGs.   Since I've switched to 2v2, I win 2/3 of the matches I play. So in my opinion, the answer is yes."
CompanyOfHeroes,3ctkjj,ultrasuper3000,3,Fri Jul 10 17:54:03 2015 UTC,"2) Yes still at the moment. The heavy limiting was a good step but you just need to look at the matchmaking percentages - larger Axis percentage in large team games than ever before.   The balance changes affect large team games differently to tactical 1v1's and 2v2's. The changes were mainly buffing mg's and making light vehicles more viable, light vehicles have a very slim usefulness window in 4v4's, and the Ost mg is now the best suppression tool in the game.   Change will come though, and 4v4's are still good fun so long as you're not up against CAS."

Eisenhower was confident that operation overlord would be such a success that the war would be won in Europe by Christmas 1944. Monty thought there was no way, so they bet £5. Monty won.   Earlier on in the war during Montys time in North Africa he asked Eisenhowers chief of staff if he could get a B-17 bomber for personal use. Eisenhowers chief of staff jokingly said that if he captured Sfax, Tunisia before April the 15th then Eisenhower would give him whatever he wanted. He captured it on April the 5th and then almost cause an international incident by demanding the plane.. Patton was enraged that Monty had a personal bomber and he was stuck travelling in land convoys, Eisenhower was enraged that Monty would actually accept the bomber when they were needed for bombing targets, and Monty was just laughing it up in his new personal bomber.

Consider they'll have 3 months to polish it and they only had to work on 1 faction instead of 2, I think it will be worth it. I wish the americans were done so well ..  It's only ~10 euro.

CompanyOfHeroes,3cqpu9,Kiwi_Force,7,Fri Jul 10 00:34:15 2015 UTC,"I personally much prefer the traditional campaign format to Ardenne, Assault, AA doesn't really maintain a cohesive and concise sense of continuity within its narration that the Soviet campaign had.  AA felt more like a series of moderately disconnected scenario missions than a fluent campaign"
CompanyOfHeroes,3cqpu9,commissar_lubi,5,Fri Jul 10 06:17:58 2015 UTC,Well when I said I wanted it I meant I just want single player content of some sort for the British I agree in that I would much rather have an actual campaign like the Soviet one or the CoH1 campaigns.

CompanyOfHeroes,3cqpu9,Kaiserhawk,2,Fri Jul 10 02:44:08 2015 UTC,"I don't, Ardennes was trash.  A few good set piece battles with over half the missions being skirmish style missions against Relic's moronic AI."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cqpu9,mrtacoswildride,4,Fri Jul 10 16:55:45 2015 UTC,"I hope they make the multiplayer factions free, make new balance patches every month, pump out tons of paid skins/decals/voicepacks/victorystrikes/models, integrate community made content a la Dota2, and release paid single player content like AA and the better ToW mizsions (like the one where one player is only inf and the other is only tanks!).   This game has everything it needs to be one hell of a multiplayer service. They could even bribe vets with unique skins, faceplates and decals for every army as a thank you for supporting them to ease the transition. I'm not saying it'd be easy as pie, but it'd absolutely be worth it."

CompanyOfHeroes,3cqpu9,Cheesenium,2,Fri Jul 10 05:56:06 2015 UTC,"Dota 2 model for CoH2? Hell no because if you make the factions to be free what is Relic going to make money on? Skins, face plates, campaign that many people do not want and gameplay impacting commanders that used to bring a lot of balance issues? Also, what happened to TF2's cosmetic microtrasactions really ruined the original clean art style with hats and guns with odd effects which have no place in CoH2.  I did not sign up for another free to play game that will be filled with microtrasactions. Relic will never give away the core game with all 5 factions for free and only offer optional cosmetic content. Sega will definitely flood it with microtrasactions which I do not trust Sega to do it with respect to consumers.

CompanyOfHeroes,3cqpu9,GeneralOstwind,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:11:32 2015 UTC,I suppose the definition of grand strategy varies. I should of specifically referred games similar to EUIV or HOI3. I feel their AI is done well enough most players don't expect to play multiplayer matches often.

DEATH BEFORE RETREAT.   Please cut down loads of worthless soviet soldiers, in defense of the union.   And then i went back to skirmishes.   The soviets did a lot of fucked up stuff but they didn't do it all at once. That would make them look a little crazy and hypocritical.  And that's the story of the russian backlash against this game. A little too on the nose,  Relic."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cr21n,ThumbWarriorDX,2,Sat Jul 11 19:46:06 2015 UTC,"It depends. In the campaign I would occasionally sacrifice conscripts, since some of those missions require lots of retreating and stuff. But I wasn't a huge fan of the Russian campaign. Considering that it is something like half as expensive to reinforce a squad compared to buying a new one, I guess the game has trained you well. In SC2, there are fewer options for healing units, and more of an emphasis on causing base damage, which encourages more all-in, efficient trading than CoH2."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cr21n,Katter,2,Fri Jul 10 05:53:36 2015 UTC,Sacrifices for the motherland must be made comrade. If we can't make a better tank then tiger we will just make 10 t34s instead so they run out of ammunition.
CompanyOfHeroes,3cr21n,MolotovFromHell,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:25:03 2015 UTC,All the time.  It's hard to feel remorse in SC2 when you're just sending hordes of Zerg units to their demise.  It's a whole different ball game when you've got a squad of actual people set in a more-or-less accurate historical context.  Also my grandfather was a paratrooper.

CompanyOfHeroes,3cp36t,Dreamshadow1977,3,Thu Jul 9 17:27:26 2015 UTC,"Ardennes Assault is definitely fun, but get it on sale. It's regularly available for 75% off. You can easily play it two or three times, and if you're not very good even more than that! Hard difficulty is more than a little bullshit though (you get m8 greyhounds while the enemy is spawning multiple king tigers on the third mission...) but normal is fun and reasonably challenging.   I also recommend the original campaign, which is full of well designed missions barring one where you have to hunt down a tiger ace with a limited number of engineers and conscripts using only PTRS and a small amount of muni. I recommend it, but with the caveat that if you don't skip all the videos where fully rendered people are wandering about you're gonna have a bad time because the story is shit awful.   I do want to add that if you want to play as USF/OKW in AI Skirmish or online, you need to buy the Western Front Armies pack which is separate from the Ardennes Assault Single Player Campaign. So keep that in mind."

Of course, having paid full price for COH2/WFA I'd be mad at this point.... but seriously, the Valve f2p model beats being gouged 15 bucks per faction and a whopping 40 on single player DLC."

Of course Relic and Sega won't go for it, but then it wouldn't really be a Dota style f2p game, as has been suggested above.   But really, if they regulated the skins (something along the lines of Red Orchestra 2, where players look more haggard and war-weary as they level up, or the Germans getting summer sleeves, for instance), the Valve model is easily the least painful, and I don't even play TF2 or Dota anymore (nor World of Tanks or War Thunder or what have you). All I'm saying is let's not trash it for the sake of trashing f2p."
CompanyOfHeroes,3co9yd,Mr_125,2,Fri Jul 10 10:48:20 2015 UTC,"I am not trashing F2P as I am currently playing other F2P games. It just that RTS had been traditionally awful in F2P business model due to it's difficulty to monetise.   Valve model with skins isn't perfect, because there are a lot of community assets does detract from the game's artstyle. A lot of the new items in TF2 especially, does not fit in the game's art style.   At the end, I do not want to see a solid RTS like CoH2 being ruined after it decides to go F2P instead. RTS and F2P does not go well together."

CompanyOfHeroes,3cpbjj,Chooseday,3,Thu Jul 9 18:09:12 2015 UTC,"For defensive play your best bet is wehr probably. MGs + Pak guns and you'll be pretty solid against pretty much anything. MG bunkers especially are great early game to hold down a VP or fuel. You'd just have to be careful against riflemen and their smoke, but just reposition as soon as you see that smoke arcing towards you.   Ditto on how to deal with tank spam, pak guns + grens/panzer grens can typically do the job pretty well, get a hit or two with the pak, then snare with a faust from a gren and finish the job with the pak or panzergrens.   As long as you have manpower you can counter pretty much anything. For resources, make sure you're using your fuel and teching up, don't let fuel sit there. Going for an early P4 has worked pretty well for me personally as it'll be able to counter any allied tank at that point plus it's good anti-inf.   For commanders, it depends, if you're going for defense in team games, try for a commander with a pak 43, that thing can demolish tanks like no other and shoots through shot blockers like houses."

CompanyOfHeroes,3cpbjj,Mandarion,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:48:31 2015 UTC,"43s are incredibly easy to kill with indirect fire, BUT if you sneak one and keep it hidden before a fight it can win you tank battles super easy. the 43 is the the best anti tank weapon in the game, the only thing that comes close is the jagdtiger (which fires slower)  just be sneaky with it if you want to use it"
CompanyOfHeroes,3cpbjj,draje175,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:03:43 2015 UTC,"The Jagdtiger is actually better, it has over 500 penetration instead of the 340 the PaK 43 has. Both do 320 damage and the PaK 43 reloads two seconds faster, which gives the PaK 43 the higher DPS, but the Jagdtiger can actually move and has the highest armour out of any unit in the game."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cpbjj,nicksam112,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:05:47 2015 UTC,"Ya i sort of meant in the dps wise. The pak has good enough pen to realistically hit through all allied armor (sans is2 a minor amount of the time). As well its massively cheaper.  The jagdtiger has super armor, but it gets dazed everytime something pokes at it ~_~ making it the easiest heavy tank to kill if its poorly placed/protected"

If South, get the trainstation. If North, get all the buildings by their fuel and the large one by the left VP.  Focus solely on FHQing. Make secondary and tertiary FHQs. The line WILL be held.  Once done right, its a non stop stranglehold that especially shits on teams that have less OKW. The 1 or 2 OKW players get quickly mobbed and their trucks AT gunned, and the Ostheer players cant outdps the reinforcing 120s, so any indirect fire short of a stuka is fairly ineffective. If you lose 1 FHQ, youll have 3 more. Especially if you spawn south, theres like 3 adjacent buildings far enough from each other that a stuka cant hit two at once (plus the train station is made out of vault-tec material apparently)  As the FHQ player, eventually tech to T4 and get a Katy and SU85. Prior to that, hold the line with a few con squads, some flamers, potentially T1 and an M3 if fuel allows, and a pair of the lil bitch AT guns. The m42 fires fast as fuck and gets really nice vet bonuses, and the tracking ability helps hold the front line by sighting for the 120s. USF dude fights on the other side of the map denying as many resources as possible, while sending whatever token squad or light vehicle support he can to the FHQ line.

CompanyOfHeroes,3cn8zo,joe1113,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:30:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even call that cheese, though. 3 penals without a clown car and flamethrower are a dead giveaway for what you're about to try, so the object is to squadwipe them asap."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cnyo3,TheEvilAdventurer,6,Thu Jul 9 11:27:12 2015 UTC,"Ok so after watching your replay, you're not gonna get much value out of a play by play just yet.  Let's first talk builds, because you're clearly not sure what does and doesn't work with USF. You went 2x RE, 4x Rifle, LT, M20, MJR, Sherman, Scott, Jackson. Pretty late in the game you picked Rifle company. You eventually upgraded BARs (which you didn't need as your opponent had basically no line infantry), and neglected to buy grenades (which you did because you needed smoke for that MG) or flamers (which are perfect for wiping close range infantry like Pgrens or support weapons).  USF needs to pick a commander early on and then build around that commander. The good all rounder commanders are Rifle, Armor, Infantry and Airborne.   Rifle Company  Standard Rifle: 4x Rifle, CPT, Stuart, ambo, AT gun*, (pack howitzer), e8 spam  Aggressive Rifle: 4x Rifle, LT, Flak Truck, ambo, CPT, Stuart, AT gun, e8 spam  With both, if you're doing well and floating manpower get a fuel cache down.  You should upgrade flamers on everyone, and if your enemy is heavy on the mobile anti infantry vehicles (luchs, flak half track, stug e) you should consider adding a bazooka to each rifle squad after the flamers are passed out.  Infantry Company   Standard Infantry: 4x rifle, CPT, stuart, ambo, AT gun, (pack howitzer), Major, SHERMANS, 1 jackson, (priest)  You'll absolutely have enough MP for a fuel cache. Infantry company has M7 light AT mines, put a group of four of them in tight clusters them on roads or other choke points. They'll stun, damage and immobilize enemy vehicles that walk over them while costing peanuts. You can use shift + click to place four while reducing the micro tax. Infantry company also has free LMGs, which you should put 2x of on 2 or more squads based on your playstyle. You can't fire LMGs while moving, so if you're more of an attacker you should get fewer of them than if you prefer a more campy play style. Sandbags everywhere, wire on the side of the sandbag your enemy would use. Only get a priest if your enemy is extremely campy, is OKW (shell the trucks!), or blobs hard and mass retreats (shell the retreat point after the mass retreat has begun for tears galore).   Armor Company  Armor company is a bit tougher to use than the other two above. You need to be comfortable maneuvering large amounts of fragile vehicles to get good performance out of it.   Aggressive Armor: 1x assault engineer, 3x rifle, LT, flak truck/m20, BARs, ambo, fuel cache, m10, m10, dozer shermans  Cautious Armor: 1x assault engineer, 4x rifle, CPT, stuart, AT gun, BARs, ambo, fuel cache, m10, m10, dozer sherman  Assault engineers are one of the most underrated units in the game. They can easily take pios, or volks, can heavily damage sturmpios, and can crush grens with either a little bit of support or clever use of shot/vision blockers. After they've got a flamer, they're top dog when it comes to 1v1 on a point vs anything other than sturms, where the outcome depends on flame crits. They can also lay demo charges for on demand blob annihilation, M7 light AT mines (same rules as infantry company ones) and can place tank traps/barbed wire for maximum annoyance value. Use them to maintain control of the flanks while your main rifle army plows into the mid hard. M10 is a fast and cheap jackson, dozer sherman is a beefy as fuck scott.   Airborne Company  Airborne is probably still the best all round option. They also give you the most freedom and flexibility thanks to elite infantry, ok AT skillplanes, and the ability to summon AT guns and .50 cals from the sky.   Standard Airborne: 3x rifle, LT, M20, Paratrooper, AT gun callin, MJR, Shermans  Cautious Airborne: 3x rifle, CPT, Stuart, Para, build AT gun, Para, MJR, Shermans  Some people swear by Pathfinders, but don't build them. They're fragile, expensive to reinforce, pop cap whores, micro intensive and mostly good for spotting or some cheese builds. Paratroopers are basically better riflemen with the same reinforce cost but no AT grenades. You almost always want to get their LMG upgrade, although if you're playing on something like Stalingrad the Thompsons can be helpful. AT and MG callins are good in a pinch but more expensive than building one out of the base as you have to crew them.   P47 callin isn't as good as people make it out to be. The rockets do very little damage these days and have significant trouble hitting, well, anything. Vs OKW they'll probably also get shot down before they do more than one pass. That said, Axis players are still scared of them so use it over a heavily fortified position before an assault to drive off their tanks, and then clear out all their infantry and support weapons secure in the knowledge that those fuckers won't be getting armor support anytime soon. A muni cache can be a wortwhile investment to get more stuff.   General Advice   Shermans are for counter harassment and supporting an infantry push, not diving into enemy positions. Think of them as direct fire artillery that can also swoop down and eat isolated enemy infantry and you'll make much better use of them.  Jacksons are fast AT guns and should be treated as such. Keep them behind infantry and other tanks, and use them to drive off enemy tanks rather than secure kills. Remember, a repairing tank may as well be dead for all the good it'll do your enemy during a fight.  If you build an m20, mine all the things. Prioritize mines along your retreat paths and mines on roads the enemy will use to get to VPs. Even if they don't secure a kill, they'll put an enemy tank out of action for a long time as it will be immobilized and have to wait for repair units to come to it. Be very careful about diving into the enemy base after a sniper, a single gren squad fausting you will mean gg for that poor m20 which costs way more.  Based on your replay, you're very clearly scared of being called a blobber and as a result are sending unsupported squads all over the fucking map. When they all end up in firefights you get overwhelmed by the micro and start taking unnecessary losses by doing things like having a dance party with a gren squad while a sniper pops your men like pinatas. Don't do that. Pick an objective and then hit that objective with overwhelming force from at least two directions. One of those directions should be for your base of fire team, and the other should be for your assault team. Base of fire approach should preferably have lots of green cover, and troops in it with LMGs. Assault team approach should preferably have lots of shot blockers to keep the enemy from seeing you, and troops in it with flamers, grease guns or thompsons. After you've pushed off the enemy, either mine up and fortify the position or move on toward the next objective.  Blobbing is having all your squads tightly clumped in a way that makes them great targets for indirect fire (mortar, rocket arty) or grenades. Four squads spread out in cover hitting an objective isn't blobbing, it's smart play.  If there is only one viable line of approach, send in a rear echelon, pathfinder or rifle flare before an attack to see where the enemy are. Then use rifle smoke to create sight blockers between you and enemy positions. Then charge in, surround enemy support weapons and fuck them up with grenades or CQC fire.  Harassment/counter harassment is the job of Rear Echelons (who are cheap and virtually disposable) and Assault Engineers (who can mine and demo charge everything). If you're capping with rifles while a firefight is going on somewhere else, you've fucked up.  Don't fucking sit in front of an OST sniper having a firefight. This is a great way to bleed shitloads of manpower and lose the game. Either pull behind a shotblocker and wait for reinforcements to scare the sniper off, push forward with infantry supporting a light vehicle, or just retreat and attack somewhere else. Panzergrenadiers without shrecks are extremely dangerous units in CQC. Either shoot them as they approach or kite them. PGrens with shrecks can be ignored if you don't have vehicles. If you do have them, a .50 cal will chase off whole herds of them.  If your enemy doesn't have vehicles or minesweepers, detail an RE squad to stick barbed wire around your fuel point to prevent harassment.  USF wins with VPs, not tanks. If you don't own all 3 VPs at a given point in time, figure out why and then fix that problem.  Current OST meta is 2x MG, 3x Gren, 2x Pio, (sniper), Scout Car, pgren, 10min PAK, 14min P4/stug g for miles. Preferred doctrines are close air support, lightning war and elite troops (tiger ace). If you see every squad upgraded with LMGs/flamers with mines everywhere at 3CPs, your enemy is CAS. If you see G43 instead of LMG, elite troops or lightning war. If you see super vetted units with no kills, elite troops AND dumb opponent.  if you're fighting vs OKW, or vs an OST player who doesn't build grens, get a .50 cal and use it to suppress the blob that Axis players inevitably build. It's almost as strong suppression wise as an MG42 and a good bit more damaging. If they're using grens don't bother building one as they'll just riflenade it to bits.  always build an at gun at the 8-10 minute mark and either leave it in your base or near your base and along your most frequent retreat path pointed toward the most likely enemy angle of approach. Only move it out of your base if you hear or see enemy armor. Always keep it back out of line of sight and bait enemy tanks into it by soft retreating their preferred targets into the cone rather than moving it toward them. Also, USF vet 1 AT guns have Take Aim as an ability, it massively increases range and line of sight for a minor muni cost, always have it on.    Conclusion   If you're still having trouble as USF, play as Guard Motor Soviets and enjoy yourself."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cnyo3,mrtacoswildride,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:44:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks, It seems like I had a fundamental misunderstanding of how to play the USF, could you give a quick run down of how to play the different factions?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3cnyo3,mrtacoswildride,2,Thu Jul 9 16:21:39 2015 UTC,"I wish. I know what OKW does, but not how to do it myself. Soviets I'm alright with, and Ost, well, double MG fortress with a halftrack to victory!  Soviets have two builds I'm comfortable with. One is Guard Motor. You build three cons and an engineer, special rifle building and an m3. You put a flamer in the m3 and use it for shock initially, then counter harassment. You also build a sniper and/or a 120mm and two guards. Cover the map in sandbags, demo charges and mines, and then try to force wipes and push the enemy wherever they're not.   After a while the t34-85s show up and you can start busting a nut on the axis.   The other one I'm comfortable with is Shock Rifle. Four cons and an engie into support weapon company, with a pair of 82mm mortars, a maxim and a zis gun (10min mark) to round things out. Then t3 into a t34-76 or two to fend off the P4s/Stugs and give you some shock, followed by an IS2. Again, mines, demo charges and sandbags everywhere.   With Soviets, basically every time your engineer goes to a point they should build a mine on that point. Worst case scenario you get one model kill for 30muni, or the outcome of a shitty grenade. Best case scenario you get a squad wipe or a disabled vehicle for 30muni and no micro. It's a pretty unbeatable investment. Demo charges are more expensive, so reserve them for key points (fuel, muni, VP) or places your enemy loves to harass (cutoff, the big church in Semois).  Conscripts behind sandbags can beat a gren squad in yellow cover at long range, and whatever the outcome will make the fight take forever (good if you're defending something!). Guards behind sandbags can probably beat any two squads that aren't obers at long range.  Green cover reduces the damage you take from grenades thrown by squads on the other side of said sandbags.   Don't stand in front of sandbags or any other shotblocker when a tank is firing, it'll almost certainly convert a miss into a hit when it hits said object.   ZiS gun is multirole artillery, so be sure to use the barrage. 82 and 120mm mortars have a flare which can be handy for scouting. Guards can button, which forces enemy tanks to stop firing and slows them down. Kind of pricy and bad, but occasionally a game changer.   Last thing, always be looking for ways to scout your opponent. If you can see it you can hit it, and if you can hit it you can kill it. A flank you know about is an opportunity to cut off and destroy isolated enemy squads. Even the basic points are worth a lot over the course of a game. 3 fuel per minute adds up to 90 fuel over 30 minutes, or in other words an extra tank/tech level/two upgrades. Always be harassing, but always be harassing with cheap units like engineers, REs, pios, assault engineers, etc. Keep your good stuff working against the enemy."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cnyo3,Tetracyclon,2,Thu Jul 9 17:26:14 2015 UTC,"-Your early was ok, maybe you could have gone more abusive with getting veterans.  -When you fight with riflemen against grenadiers try to get in little closer, especially when you flank them in 2 vs 1. Keep your guys at medium range, a little further than a flamerthrower attacks.  -Try to get behind the sniper with your scout car.  -Place more mines in more frequented positions, then lure enemy tanks into them. But dont make it obious.  -Dont use your armor so aggressive, they are no panzers. Use them as support for your Infantry. I personally dont like shermans and prefer a mortar carrier over it.  -Use riflegrenades to destroy tank engines!  -In end game you shouldn't let your infantry bleeding out in favor of tanks. Keep at least 4 squads alive!  Hope that helps you a little. I wouldn't have used the rilfecomp, maybe airborne or mechanised but thats more a personal thing."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cnyo3,F1SH_T4C0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:17:01 2015 UTC,if you make the replay* into a youtube video instead of just the replay file I bet you will get a lot more feedback.
CompanyOfHeroes,3cnyo3,HauntedGrass,0,Thu Jul 9 12:19:50 2015 UTC,"Now, I'm no pro, I don't play USF that much either. But right off the bat, I would have picked rifle company to get some veteran riflemen to have an advantage early game. Flamethrowers would've been good as well. Also, I wouldn't have gotten that second Rear Echelon get riflemen instead. Early game, about 5 minutes in, I would have gotten an MG or two. You would've been able to hold the territory much longer, so you wouldn't have to play those cat and mouse games where you would cap a point, leave, and the enemy would immediately go cap it back. A nice place for an MG would have been the top fuel, which had a house in a really nice position. Also an MG at mid. He had an MG holding the chokepoint right outside his base for most of the game. With two rifleman squads, I would've just thrown a smoke grenade or two and wiped it out. Maybe even take the MG yourself.  You could've placed down more Utility Car mines, you had plenty of munitions. Also that sniper. Bled you a lot of manpower. 30 kills before you killed it. Not sure what you'd do differently. Maybe try to smoke it, then charge with your Utility Car to get closer to it. You were a bit reckless with your Sherman, sending it into the fog of war without scouting ahead with infantry. Your riflemen had the flare ability, should use it more often.   I hope I helped a bit. To beat a german player you need to take their fuel as often as possible, so you'll always try to lock down their fuel.  Edit: If someone wants to correct something I wrote, go ahead."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cnyo3,mrtacoswildride,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:27:49 2015 UTC,"MG vs ost as USF is a free MG to ost. .50 cal is an assault support MG or an armor cover MG, not an area denial MG, especially vs OST. 2x MG as USF is a waste of manpower ESPECIALLY VS OST. Riflenades are gg to 4 man front line support weapons.   2nd RE on semois 1v1 is a good buy because the map is huge, but sending the second RE into mid while the second rifle capped was dumb.   Charging sniper supported by gren is a good way to lose m20 to double faust.   1 m20 mine is SOP, but placing it in front of fuel late in the game rather than on retreat path immediately after building m20 isn't. More mines is fine, but not as rifle company where you're better off getting flamers and zooks or BARs depending on whether your opponent is vehicle heavy or infantry heavy.   Early vet rifles is a bad idea against OST. It's the safest time to gain vet on infantry, USF is already MP constrained and buffed MG makes that worse, plus OST doesn't have kubel to AT nade. It should be used in mid game exclusively to replace wiped squads.   Beating a german player as USF is about early VP dominance to close out the game by 20min mark. Fuel is irrelevant so long as you've got your point, especially against someone sitting for callins which this guy clearly was due to lack of 222 vs m20. Second most important point is muni to deny infantry upgrades, rifle nades and fausts, and to beef up own infantry.   tl;dr your advice reads like someone who plays a lot of OST (mg reliance, fuel focus), not someone who plays USF."

CompanyOfHeroes,3cjuhs,MulleboySE,5,Thu Jul 9 18:34:40 2015 UTC,"The worst part is that US players are doomed on chokepoint maps.    These maps are all about barrage artillery and heavy tanks. The US only has one barrage piece, it's a call-in, and (in my opinion) it really sucks. As for heavy armor, it's non existent. Just initiating a fight means sacrificing a vehicle to the first volley of fire."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cjuhs,AsskickMcGee,6,Wed Jul 8 15:16:44 2015 UTC,"Fuck it heres a tip i never wanted circulated but will anyway. Use phosphorous rounds on mortar halftracks. Build caches slanted towards munitions. Any vehicles in WP has a vehicle gunners crit on it. They cant shoot. Attack ground into the smoke to kill useless vehicles. You can completely shut down half the enemies available space to defend from.  US forces are hardly fucked if used right.  Haha nice got downvoted by some scrub. Bury this shit, i dont need people learning how to play."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cjuhs,internet-arbiter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:41:50 2015 UTC,"The priest is the best arty piece in the game hands down. With the B4 and the German and Russian arty guns, once you know where they are there's a shit load of wats you can blow them up and they can't go anywhere, not to mention how inaccurate they are. With the priest it's more accurate and can be moved out of range. Long games on shittard are so easy to win as the allies, because three or more priests barraging a king tiger on the bridge can easily take it out if not severely damage it, then all you need is an su85 or Jackson. I've won games on ahittard building no heavy tanks and just spamming arty and a few tank destroyers as the allies. The Germans really can't contend no matter how many kts they build because they can only fit one at a time accross the bridges. Then you knock out the okws bases as well easily with recon plus time on target plus one priest creeping barrage."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cjuhs,Rumsies,12,Thu Jul 9 00:05:07 2015 UTC,"I enjoy playing those maps, I love playing RTS games where I can turtle against an AI and then proceed to kill ungodly amounts of enemies as they try to attack.  I don't really play that many games against actual people and split my play time between automatch VS AI and custom games where I can play some seriously unbalanced games and just have fun blowing things up.   I'm willing to bet there are a lot of players like me, some who just enjoy killing things and some who (like my friend) can't manage a map where there are flanking options and this makes them mad when they get flanked and they immediately start raging and then quit because it's no longer fun."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cjuhs,Hippocrap,4,Wed Jul 8 15:23:07 2015 UTC,"I'm not opposed to choke point maps, but IMO infantry should always have more options than tanks on a chockey map.

CompanyOfHeroes,3cjuhs,thefonztm,5,Wed Jul 8 14:12:09 2015 UTC,"Becuase with chokepoint maps you have that option to either rush and have a quick game or slow things down, wire up bridges, lay mines, dig in and utilize some of the more creative units in the game. These units, which might not be utilized much outside of the chokepoint maps, offer a completely different style of play and, combined with the structure of the map, drastically alter gameplay. Many players find this appealing or otherwise unattainable."

Look, I understand that you enjoy playing the game in a different way than I do, and I can respect that - there's no accounting for taste, after all - but please don't bullshit me. I have played my fair share of chokepoints maps, and there's nothing ""creative"" about the units used there. You might tell me - ""hey but I can use infiltration units to go behind enemy lines and..."" well guess what, you can do that in maps that are not plagued by chokepoints and they're still damn effective if used correctly.

I didn't consider people who like playing compstomps, for example, and I can see why you'd like to play an easier map when you just want a relaxing game. That's a fair point of view, one I had not thought about.  But the point that guy made about chokepoint maps allowing you to use units in a creative way, well, I'm sorry but that sounds incredibly untrue to me - the whole point of a chokepoint map is to hinder freedom of movement, and how can you be creative or smart about unit usage when your opponent already knows where your attack is going to come from? And while yes, you can be clever with placing your artillery units as well, they're not exactly playmaker units - you select them, click where you want things to explode, shiftclick a move command if they're mobile units, and that's about it.  I mean I guess you could use mortars to cover your advance but then again your route of advance would probably be showered with enemy artillery anyway so idk"

(I personally like Pine River Dam from time to time, but not so much the others). I personally feel that many maps are just too open. So it isn't a love of chokepoint maps, it is a dislike of completely open maps.   Those maps that are divided across the diagonal, and thus have a huge front with your enemy are just too hectic, with few sensible ways to keep the action focused in a few places. Personally I like Rails and Metal, which, while it isn't a chokepoint map, it is thin and long, and the action becomes focused in a few regions, leading to more satisfying gameplay (IMO).   I personally don't like chokepoint maps where there are no real alternative routes, but when a map provides natural obstacles and barriers, I find it more fun than maps that are extremely open."

There was a small loading ramp with wheels that the crew placed a round using an internal ceiling crane.  They then pushed it towards the breech and closed the door.  Apparantly only 18 were made total in the war according to this Inside the Tanks youtube series and they could only hold 13 shots with 1 in the breech. Often they were abandoned after those 13 shots because by 1943 there was no reliable resupply of 376kg (829lb) naval artillery shells to the frontlines.

CompanyOfHeroes,3cf8dn,thefonztm,2,Tue Jul 7 23:34:17 2015 UTC,Its not rly worth it. It cant target the planes coming from off map so half the time they get shot down after they are called in.

CompanyOfHeroes,3cf8dn,Whiski,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:06:27 2015 UTC,"What they should do is, increase the cost/cooldown of all the air support abilities. If your plane survives the run then you get refunded and the cooldown timer goes back to what it was before. Also make it possible to shoot down certain airstrikes that you currently can't, like the Stuka dive bomb (correct me if I'm wrong but I've never seen it happen).  I'd really like to see Airstrikes vs. AA coverage made into a proper fleshed-out game mechanic, right now the ability to actually shoot down aircraft feels like a gimmicky afterthought that most of the time does nothing or actually penalizes the player who bought AA."
CompanyOfHeroes,3cf8dn,Ironcl4d,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:25:59 2015 UTC,"The stuka costs a lot of muni and it the last ability unlocked on the doctrine. It has a telegraphed attack due to the loud noise that indicated where its going to land. It is very much like every last arty call in that other faction get. How do you balance that? You couldn't shoot down the incoming off map arty.  If you increase the cost then you make that risk reward a bit out of whack. Sure it could be refunded if your plane survives but you don't have any control over the plane so it becomes to random and frustrating.   AA coverage can make a real difference with planes that loiter and have the primary use of being anti inf, like the flack HT."

Every other call in attack has some smoke warning or something.  Why not stukah?  It is more powerful than 2 planes hitting a tank in two passes with p47.    It is the only commander that can call in recon, infantry strafe, and a dive bomb at once which is utter bs.  Go into a 4's game and have 4 people do it?  Goodluck ever winning"

CompanyOfHeroes,3cdqs6,theshangzilla,2,Tue Jul 7 08:25:31 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much how I play. Just push and retreat often. One of the best things about OKW is the healing station. You can heal and reinforce units, and even the AT gun can retreat although its weaker.   One thing though I personally feel the KT is the most over rated tank in the game. It is way to fucking slow to do anything besides being a sponge. I find its impossible to put in an advantageous position without pushing to far in and getting decimated because its to slow to get out. Only thing it is good for is deterring them from pushing a particular spot (which obviously can be useful). But Id much rather the more offensive approach and get 2 or maybe even 3 panthers if you have the cap space. A couple panthers and 2 or 3 shrek-volk squads is pretty deadly.

Maybe if you just sat it there and watched for 60 seconds without either advancing or retreating that could happen. But in practice you either advance and force the SU85 off the field or you back up and draw it into your AT.  The KT is great at being the core of a bigger push. If you back it up with infantry and other armor or AT guns to chase off the SU85 it is really hard to take down. It can squad wipe Guards consistently in one shot. It takes half the health off an SU85 in one shot. It's an awesome tank."

They're weak, especially early game, but keep them alive and by mid-late game volks become some of the most versatile and useful infantry out there with all their vet bonuses + schrek. However while they are strong against vehicles in a blob, against mortars or MG's they get weaker the more you blob. So try to flank and attack from multiple directions when you can.  Use units like pumas or the flak HT to keep the enemy on their toes, volks to fill in gaps/pushing points, and keep it up until you get the flak hq + panthers. Then its just a matter of sweeping up."

In t1, they have pretty much the strongest units in the game, which means T1 you push your strength advantage, and prepare your T2/T3 to counter what you expect (or see) from the enemy player(s). Once their T2 or T3 gets rolling, they have a counter for pretty much everything in the game.  Except B-4.  Fuck B-4."

One AT Strafe and both are gone ;)  I find it mildly annoying how much resources soviets can put into support and still be competetive whereas as Ostheer you struggle to get up a single Shit-FH-18.... anyways. CAS all the way if you encounter that setup.
CompanyOfHeroes,3cbgw6,shitfit_,3,Tue Jul 7 04:39:08 2015 UTC,"Close Air Support.  It is cheese, but the best way to fight artillery cheese is with more cheese.  For OKW, it is much much harder.  Falls are pretty good at killing Katys when caught near a building, but that will usually only work once.  Honestly the B4 is still quite good against OKW, and the ML20 is also amazing.  As much as people bitch about CAS, it is almost a requirment against SU, between guard/dank hunter blobs and static artillery.  Now if they are just using Katys then consider doing a flank rush with a luchs or an ostwind."

Following your logic the Panzer IV should have the same gun stats as the StuG G (or just a bit less in the case it is a Panzer IV Ausführung G with its L/43 KwK), the Jagdpanzer IV would have the same stats as the Panther and the Pak 40 would be a lot better than the Stug and Panzer UI's gun.

Yes, the Brits are coming soon and the US may soon have a commander w/ a heavy call-in, but if you're familiar with COH 2, you should be comfortable w/ new factions and new commanders by now.

CompanyOfHeroes,3carwu,F1SH_T4C0,2,Mon Jul 6 15:23:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a hardcore german sided player, always have been and always will be.   When the game was new the team ratios were  G: 50%-78%  Then there were some updates and one that pretty much changed the gameplay quite a lot. Guns actually did damage and did so on different distances, smg's and assault rifles wrecked at short distances, rifles long to medium, mg's medium and so on. Explosives killed very well. They now have damage zones. When you klick on grenade buttons your cursor will hover above a red circle, within that red line circle is a filled in red zone, the more, contrasted (more red) that zone is the bigger chance it is (inevitably) that the soldiers there dies.  Seeming that the Ostheer starts with a  squad of pios wielding Mp40's, they wiped out the very first unit the russians had. The grenaderis automatically are equipped with rifle grenades, russians have to upgrade them.   German teams were now the most popular.  G: 80%-90%  And back and fourth with the updates. Eventually the germans got too good again when they got the OKW (elite infantry spawning with an LMG and so on).   Then the russians got a boost and got too good.  G: 60%(At best) - 77%  Now it's much more equal.   Teams are evening out a bit more. However, MG's are much more realistic now (arguably cool but it doesn't work to well if you want a more arcade like RTS like CoH).  Example:  If positioned right, the MG42 can and will suppress a blob of infantry in seconds, making some of them idle. That paired witha  damage enhancing bulletin will be IMHO a bit to overkill. Two squad of grenadiers (no less) without LMG's will suppress one squad (no more) of basic rifle infantry.   Heavy tanks are the only ones that can damage other heavy tanks with significant power. Medium tanks cannot attack heavy with significant power but can wipe out smaller vehicles.  Only one really heavy tank is allowable per player now, (One IS2 per russian player, one tiger ace per Ostheer, OBKW can build as many King Tigers as they want since they are unlocked through buildings.  Those are the most noteworthy points.   That and the fact that decent German steel is still to fucking expensive.  I think these changes are good. The MG's open up to the fact that basic match tactics have to be changed (usually it's build an infantry building, spawn an MG and rifle squad while the engineers cap flags).   So now you have to find another pattern, i think the game now is dictated by the smart and not the spammer.  But that's just my opinion and understanding."

Usually OKW can not afford a lot of vehicles, most of the time a maximum of 2 medium-chassis-vehicles (Jagdpanzer, Panther) or one heavy (King Tiger) if you throw in the light vehicle in the early game (flakht or puma). If the OKW player is able to float as much fuel to get more than that in a regular game ,in a regular timeframe of about 40mins, you did something awefully wrong.   This is no critique, I just wanted to put emphasis on this because its not as much of  a problem in a balanced matchup as people make it out to be"

CompanyOfHeroes,3c73wn,abetterthief,16,Sun Jul 5 17:05:42 2015 UTC,"They're very different.  DoW 1 is a more traditional base building RTS-- think WC3 mashed up with CoH. Expansion quality is variable, but the core factions were well designed and fun. It's pretty dead from a multiplayer perspective, but it has some decent campaigns.  DoW2 has almost no base building and a stronger emphasis on tactics. Each faction has a selection of heroes that specialize your options and gives you a powerful unit to boot. It's wildly different from DoW, and has its own adherents. It's not particularly popular in multiplayer right now either, but that's not surprising given its age.   In terms of setting, it's pretty cool. The dystopian space future gives a lot of options for neat units and abilities. It could be really hit or miss given the turnover at relic, but at its best the series is quite good."
CompanyOfHeroes,3c73wn,troglodyte,2,Sun Jul 5 17:57:44 2015 UTC,Now I never really got into the MP of DoW2 but there seems to be some that are still playing the DoW2 MP on Retribution (which is stand-alone) but it seems like they are using the ELITE (rebalancing) mod. Personally I only played the campaigns and the last stand mode.  For DoW1 you will probably have the best luck finding games on the Dark Crusade expansion; Soulstorm might also work. The thing on DoW1 though is that you need all the expansions to be able to use all the races in MP (no problem in single player).

CompanyOfHeroes,3c73wn,Duder211,8,Sun Jul 5 21:30:30 2015 UTC,That is one weak argument. Remind me when they flee like little girls screaming?   What when YOU retreat them?   Retreating doesn't equal fleeing.   Having a retreat button is not a good reason to not play a game.  It's a game after all and needs balancing.  So what if it's not 100% up to your standards of lore.   That's just being petty and pedantic.   In the first Dow having squads of 10 space marines die so easily is a better argument.  Then simply retreating to fight another day. That's called tactics.

No more 50 guardsmen vs 20 Space Marines, more like 50 Guardsmen vs 5 Space Marines.

Here's the definition of the tactics level taken from the US Defense Department:   ...The level of war at which battles and engagements are planned and executed to accomplish military objectives assigned to tactical units or task forces. Activities at this level focus on the ordered arrangement and maneuver of combat elements in relation to each other and to the enemy to achieve combat objectives.   Strategy is your long term plan to reach a higher goal and tactics are short term maneuvers and specific actions taken to accomplish your strategy.

I remember right before that patch (like a day) playing with someone who had between two-three stalin's hammers going and essentially turned the game around for us when he nailed two vet panthers with a vet 3 b4.

But Automatch is intended for random players to go against random players in various team sizes. A  lot of players are okay with that but some just can't handle it and finds a clan and stomp players that are in it for the random actions in randomized teams. There's a reason why Relic put so much work into the auto match maker optimizing it as much as they can. It's sad to see certain players take advantage of random players just looking to have fun with, and against other random players with the little time they have. Not so that they can join a match wich is intended for that but then get absolutely wrecked by a clan of people that does no other but find random playing players that are weak and wreck them. Wich is no fair sport. No sport at all for that matter, it's just rude and ruins the majority of the players experience with the game.   This very problem is also frequent in WARGAME.  Really sad to see people ruin games like these. If you want to be in a clan, do what clans were made for. Going against other clans and being competitive with players that want to go competitive too."

CompanyOfHeroes,3c8n6x,Nyashh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:00:38 2015 UTC,That's not their fault that's relics fault for not auto matching groups together. You cant blame people who like playing with a group. I don't personally play competitively with this game but there is no harm in doing so. Some games are more fun that way. Having good communications and having strategies is what team based RTS games are designed for.
CompanyOfHeroes,3c8n6x,THHanson,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:32:13 2015 UTC,"That's not their fault that's relics fault for not auto matching groups together.   No it's their fault for being opportunistic against solo players (wich the majority of automatch players are).   You cant blame people who like playing with a group   I can, since they're ruining the game experience for almost everyone they meet.   there is no harm in doing so   There is. The majority of the players are solo players wich mean that they aren't and cannot be as organized as these pub stompers are. They know very well what they are doing when they join automatch in a group.   Some games are more fun that way.   some    CoH 2 isn't one of them. Also, name at least five games, were it's fun for all players when organized players joining a system made for randomized gameplay and then stomp the majority of players since they often don't have the time to organize themselves.  It's only fun for the stompers.   Having good communications and having strategies is what team based RTS games are designed for.   Yeah, that's why there wasn't a voice system was implemented and originally only randomized gameplay.  If you want to play with your friends since you can't play by yourself with random people because of your horrible skills with other then go play in a clan against other clans.   No one wants that crap but the pubstomp'ers themselves."
CompanyOfHeroes,3c8n6x,Snyggkille,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:06:25 2015 UTC,"Your whole argument is based on two facts:   The only reason people play together is to ""pub stomp"". Which is complete dog shit. I enjoy playing with groups because I enjoy strategizing (we are playing a strategy game) and it is fun when you work together with your friends to complete a goal.  Everyone shouldnt play with groups because the supposed majority either doesn't have any friends to play with or dont care enough to play with any. Which is no fault of people wanting to play with a group.      Also, name at least five games, were it's fun for all players when organized players joining a system made for randomized gameplay and then stomp the majority of players since they often don't have the time to organize themselves.   Ill start off by saying that it takes litterally 5-10 minutes to group up with people. Which is nothing because you have to set aside anywhere between 45 minutes to an 75 minutes for a match anyways, becuase you never know how long theyre going to be (unless youre one of those people who drop mid match). Also, Im not going to sacrifice my fun because I enjoy playing with friends and some dont. But here are 5 games that are fun to play with groups of people:    CoH2 SC2 Rome 2 AoE Series Any FPS   So ill flip this back onto you now. IF the sole purpose of automatch was to be completely randomized they wouldn't have given the option to group up. This is true for any game actually, if they didn't want groups they wouldn't allow them.   No it's their fault for being opportunistic against solo players (wich the majority of automatch players are).   It is 100% their fault. If they would have implemented a system to make games between groups (SC2 does a very very good job of doing this) it would mitigate most of this animosity you have a group play."

CompanyOfHeroes,3c8mfw,iTzDusty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:39:43 2015 UTC,Situational YES. In most situations two pz4 are better than one panther and with HEAT ammo they can pierce anything. If they back up a panther/tiger they are awesome! Still I personally use them as mobile infantry killer and only engage tanks if I definetly know that i outnumber them/ can outcircle them (nearly every tankdestroyer can't deal with them).  Here is the big BUT: Dont get them once the enemy has a certain number of AT guns. They cant take a lot of shots before you got skirts for them.  I guess this doctrine is only for players that don't choose right at the start of the game/ need better infantry.
CompanyOfHeroes,3c6bpd,upako,4,Sun Jul 5 06:28:32 2015 UTC,"Ya the last patch buffed the suppression and damage, it's now much more potent, a strong rival to even the T70 (arguably even better) against infantry"

No rational person would ever suggest PaK diving as a viable strategy for an M5.  You can't just drive up to it since it only has to hit you once with Target Weak Point and your M5 will die without dropping a model from the PaK.  Also if someone leaves their PaK completely unsupported on the front line it is either a trap or you are playing a scrub and you should be winning anyways.
CompanyOfHeroes,3c6bpd,thefonztm,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:09:25 2015 UTC,"IMO, if your opponent leaves them unprotected, go for it. If you can avoid the firing cone while closing in your all set.  This is really fun to do with USF vehciles because you can pop the crew out which lets them mow down the enemy weapon crew and also tricks they gun into shooting at the infantry instead of the vehicle, just in case. If you're feeling fancy, try out armor company and spring for a stuart or M10 with thompsons on the crew. You will shred anything you get near."
CompanyOfHeroes,3c6bpd,MolotovFromHell,3,Mon Jul 6 14:16:33 2015 UTC,Pretty sure luchs will be ok against it.  Puma will definitely kill it that is the whole purpose of puma.  222 dies in nearly one volley to it.  Ost halftrack will die fast to it too.  Mainly don't agree with you on luchs and puma I wouldn't engage that with the quad.
CompanyOfHeroes,3c6bpd,Mandarion,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:27:40 2015 UTC,"Just try it out. In a Quad vs Luchs battle, the winner is mostly decided by who opens fire first and who doesn't move.  And the Puma is mostly limited by its fire rate, it can survive if you use Aimed Shot, but otherwise it will be in deep shit. Not to mention that Aimed Shot is not available for the Ostheer Puma..."
CompanyOfHeroes,3c6bpd,L3monJuic3,3,Sun Jul 5 16:42:28 2015 UTC,"i just ran a couple tests, the quad NEVER beats the puma, even if its shooting at the pumas rear armor point blank. the puma also outranges the quad. at best the quad brings the puma down to half HP, and thats only when its shooting at its rear armor.  the luchs fairs even better and takes very minimal damage from rear armor shots and convincingly destroys the quad."

CompanyOfHeroes,3c8vr4,abetterthief,2,Mon Jul 6 00:55:14 2015 UTC,"I think the stug without the target weak point is still pretty solid.  If you wanted to make the stug more equivalent the 76, maybe make the replacement ability something that can do weak AP? Maybe a single HE round shot at no cost but requires recharge?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3c8vr4,Foodball,4,Mon Jul 6 02:55:27 2015 UTC,So in short the  Su 76 should have higher range with its main gun (50 vs 60) and a better HE barrage than the stug then for...reasons?
CompanyOfHeroes,3c8vr4,shitfit_,2,Mon Jul 6 05:06:30 2015 UTC,The su76 in my mind is supposed to be the jack of all trades with the disadvantage of being very weak in hp and not scaling particularly well.   The stug has been designed to be a more at focused and can act as a bit of a meat shield for more valuable tanks with the limitation in maneuverability.
CompanyOfHeroes,3c8vr4,Foodball,3,Mon Jul 6 08:41:10 2015 UTC,Bit of meatshield? Have you used a stug g?
CompanyOfHeroes,3c8vr4,EliasDL,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:16:51 2015 UTC,"It takes almost as many hits as a panzer 4 while dishing about the same damage to tanks. So yeah it's a bit of a meat shield, especially when compared to the SU76."
CompanyOfHeroes,3c8vr4,Foodball,2,Mon Jul 6 13:51:18 2015 UTC,"You got some things quite wrong there, mate. The Panzer IV is supposed to act as the meat shield for the less manoeuvrable StuG.  Let us just take a second to look at the stats:   StuG: 560HP, 140 frontal armour, 160 damage, 185 penetration Panzer IV: 640HP, 180 frontal armour, 160 damage, 110 penetration   The StuG is supposed to stay back, with some other unit spotting for it. You either have enough of an advantage to kill the enemy directly, or you need a unit that can dish out enough damage to prevent the enemy from running whatever unit he has there up to the StuG. A Panzer IV works pretty well with that, as it has just about enough penetration to devastate most other tanks from behind if they try to make a run for it..."
CompanyOfHeroes,3c8vr4,Mandarion,2,Mon Jul 6 15:02:52 2015 UTC,"In team games at least a nicey 4-5 t3 tank army is beautiful for OST.  A couple stugs lined up in the back. Play forward with a PZ4 and follow up with an ostwind for infantry. Both of those get vision for stugs and hopefully PZ4 soaks hits and is in more risky position. Stuglife ruins face and spawns sadness. Kinda scares me and makes me think some sort of non-overtly heavy nerf on stugs could leave t3 in a more perfect balance. Right now it feels like a tier that has each unit with a unique job and they all have the ability to work together. Opposite of t4 with a dirty whore of an awesome tank hunter, a rocket truck that needs 2-3 to really be effective, and brumbars, whatever those godforsaken things are. Though brumbars are really way to fun to rush to as elite troops in stomps and just have 2-3 vet 3 brumbars feeling still near useless.

They are not ideal for locking down areas, though they can play that role a little bit. The DSHK has better suppressing capabilities but is unfortunately doctrinal, and still has a narrow cone of fire so should be used in the same role as a Maxim with a better effect.   even if they were buffed in their defensive role grenadiers rifle grenades largely negate any defensive capacity russian machine guns have, so use conscripts with sandbags with hmgs to the flanks if you need to defend/hold a point.   the role of the browning .50 I'm still not quite sure what it is supposed to play- it has a high damage output but isn't ideal at suppressing quickly- I think ideally it should be used in conjuction with rifle grenades or rifle men with the goal of quickly widdling down the small man size of german squads (sturms, grens, pgrens all have 4 man squads) and encouraging a retreat at the threat of a costly squad wipe."
CompanyOfHeroes,3c37hh,F1SH_T4C0,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:56:27 2015 UTC,And also the fact that it was what they were designed for in real life too. The maxim fired 500 r/m. The American M2 Browning (50.cal) fired 450–635 /r/m (WWII version). When the Mg42 fires 1500 r/m.
CompanyOfHeroes,3c37hh,Snyggkille,17,Sat Jul 4 11:16:15 2015 UTC,"I would say that you actually have it backwards in a RL context, and that Relic has it backwards with the way the weapons work in the game (which hey, it's a game, design comes before authenticity), but let me explain why.  The MG42 firing at 1200-1500RPM was fired in very short bursts,  which equated to a very quick pull of the trigger. This process was repeated staccato, because with the MG42's high rate of fire, the quick warping of barrels was a very real problem, and gunners assistants had to carry spares on hand to swap out at a moment's notice. However, the short bursts of fire and relatively good accuracy of the MG42 meant that its role in effective fire, rather than suppressive fire, was what was lauded.  The Maxim, however, with its slow rate of fire and water cooled jacket, could put down a more steady, consistent volume of fire. Sure it fired slower, but it could fire longer without needing to have its barrel changed and without depleting such an immense amount of ammunition. This made those antiquated designs like the Maxim fantastic for a role of suppressing fire, but its weight and immobility (IRL) made it rather poor at quick, effective fire."
CompanyOfHeroes,3c37hh,himmelgeist,7,Sat Jul 4 11:42:54 2015 UTC,Actually the MG 42 was so good that the americans had to set up massive propaganda campaigns to reduce the fear of it.  It was the infantry version of tigerphobia.
CompanyOfHeroes,3c37hh,Tetracyclon,6,Sat Jul 4 13:15:58 2015 UTC,"Found one of them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyj-ZHXFKQI  Just an interesting side note; Those extra ammunitions carriers were often used as marksmen are used in regular infantry squads. To pick off the enemy, pair that with the Mg42 and it will (IMO) be more worth in the long run than an extra mg team.  Also the fact that ammo was usually stored in a nearby vehicle or facility (housing/bunker/foxhole/car/apc/truck/ etc.) since the Mg42 was for the most part considered an HMG. The Mg34 was for the most part designated as the LMG, wich is one of the reasons for the slightly slower fire rate and the different ways to store portable ammunition:  belt fed: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Machine_gun_squad_MG34.jpeg  box fed: http://picturearchive.gunauction.com/573/10516257/img_5005.jpg_thumbnail0.jpg  drum fed: http://www.panzeraufgd.co.uk/images/MG34/mg34-with-50-round-drum-magazine.jpg  And of course, double drum fed: http://www.ww2incolor.com/d/50441-4/mg34tr4  Also, notice how bad the gunner of the Mp40 stands when firing while the others have a much better stance, purposely done to lower the accuracy."

CompanyOfHeroes,3c37hh,F1SH_T4C0,5,Sat Jul 4 14:49:30 2015 UTC,"The sound of the gun itself isn't that bad, the sound of that many bullets flying past you (the distinct sound of a bullet that passes you within a fifty meter radius) is what's terrifying. On a battlefield there are much worse sounds than just the MG42 (mortars and auto cannons are where I got bad feelings), but when suddenly dirt starts flying around you and the world turns into a charade of wheeeeooos, then you have reason to panic."
CompanyOfHeroes,3c37hh,Mandarion,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:10:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's an amazing video. Those things are terrifying. I like the direct comparison, you can really understand how the 42 had such an insane output. I can't imagine that many rounds just flying through the are within a second."
CompanyOfHeroes,3c37hh,Duder211,2,Sat Jul 4 22:32:42 2015 UTC,"I would like to add that a MG42 barrel change done by a competent crew took mere seconds, although that could be the difference between life and death."
CompanyOfHeroes,3c37hh,Snyggkille,2,Sat Jul 4 12:56:26 2015 UTC,"Yup, they knew what they were doing when they set the rate of fire. Both the Mg34 and 42 are designed for seconds barrel change.  On the Mg42 you simply pull out a tiny little door/hatch on the side of the pipe and pull out the barrel and insert a new one, the insertion also pulls the hatch closed so you only have to smack it once to close it and you're ready to fire again.  On the Mg34 you simply push down a button and literally dislocate/twist the receiver from the pipe and pull out the barrel and shove in a new, when that is done you just twist the receiver back and it's good to go.   Mg42 barrel change: https://youtu.be/hooswJ8wrJE?t=29  Mg34 barrel change: https://youtu.be/jrNQwQyQv_0?t=82  The very concept of the Mg42 originates from a battlefield survey that Germany conducted were the results showed that the enemy is only visible for a few seconds and therefor have to get as many bullets on them as possible before they go out of eyesight. That equals to a high rate of fire. The high rate of fire lead to them designing the machine guns in such a manor. That and the fact that the Mg42 was made out of stamped metal and was therefore easier to manufacture in large numbers for a low price.  The FN MAG (Belgian GPMG based of the Mg42) has a very similar charging handle (short stick instead of a handle) with a very similar mechanism were it throws out the casing below the gun and also has a quick barrel exchange system... grab the handle on the pipe and shove it down on the right side of the gun and pull the entire barrel out and insert a new one."

That and the fact that the Mg42 was made out of stamped metal and was therefore easier to manufacture in large numbers for a low price.   This actually even became a ""problem"" that was relayed in US intelligence reports on the Germans' own views of the weapon, including ""While U.S. soldiers have expressed a healthy respect for the MG 42's high rate of fire, they agree that the gun's dispersion is very small—so small in fact, that they have frequently been able to make successful dashes out of the field of fire."" (Intelligence Bulletin, Vol. II, No. 9, May 1944.) Which mirrors the design of the MG34S, a variant of the MG34 that had a shortened barrel, reinforced recoil spring, and higher cyclic rate of fire of 1200 RPM to increase the number and dispersion of rounds. It's odd to think of a machine gun being ""too accurate"" at effective combat distances, but bullet dispersion was a concern for this reason of quickly spraying down enemy soldiers."
CompanyOfHeroes,3c37hh,Snyggkille,2,Sat Jul 4 15:40:09 2015 UTC,"Wich also leads me to believe the single round trigger on the Mg34 was there for ""marksmanship"" if required or possible."
CompanyOfHeroes,3c37hh,TheNataris,3,Sat Jul 4 16:45:30 2015 UTC,"Basically, if you want to make it extremely simple;  MG42 - Suppresses very fast, high area of effect, high damage, low health, slow setup time  MG34 - Suppresses fast, high area of effect, low damage, low health, slow setup time but very cheap and doctrinal  Maxim - Fast single target suppression, high single target damage, no area of effect to speak of, high health, very fast setup time  DhSK - Fast single target suppression, very high single target damage, some area of effect, high health, fast setup time, expensive and doctrinal  .50 cal - Good area suppression, high damage, low health, slow setup time, expensive and comes out pretty late  Basically all the HMGs are defensive tools bar the Maxim and DhSK. Use them when assaulting positions and to hold flanks but don't expect them to do much vs blobs. Use it to pin the most expensive squad on the field so your Conscripts, Shocks or Penals can get in close where they do the most damage without suffering much.  And yes, due to the dumb new cover system you don't really want to use cover with Maxims due to the bunching up and range of Rifle Grenade."

CompanyOfHeroes,3c37hh,TheNataris,2,Mon Jul 6 18:48:30 2015 UTC,"Before units spread out a lot more in squads and threw themselves when nearby explosions hit them a lot easier.  This caused a lot of complaints, since units could throw themselves out of cover when nearby mortars hit. It would also be harder to make all the members of a squad stack near a small piece of cover, such as a truck or a single sandbag column.  So to alleviate this, units now ""stick"" to cover pretty much no matter what, and they no longer spread out at all, so that all the members can get the cover that people bitched about for so long.  Of course, the downside of that is, any single mortar hit, grenade, tank shell or explosion in general now has a chance to one-shot pretty much every single squad in the game.  I personally do not like."

CompanyOfHeroes,3c37hh,gokkel,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:19:07 2015 UTC,"Maxims are not slow to position, on the contrary, they are the fastest setting up machine gun. This is the reason why they did not get the same kind of buff as other machine guns, because people could just set up quickly or even attack move and suppress everything instantly. They said though that this does not have to be the final state of balance for this machine gun.  I have not tried MG34 yet (that one was complete junk before patch) but MG42 seems fairly powerful right now. It kind of has to be though because before it was simply not able to deal with blobs that are not even microed in any way. Since a lot of people complain they might finetune this later again."
CompanyOfHeroes,3c37hh,Mandarion,4,Sat Jul 4 11:17:47 2015 UTC,"The problem is, that no other faction has to rely as heavily on their HMGs as the Ostheer. Right now, you can walk through an entire game without getting any machine gun as both Soviets and USF if you do it right - the Ostheer simply can't, because a Grenadier squad has a much lower field presence due to only four models, and because it simply can't stand up to anything - they are meant for long range, while this game basically shits all over long range units by not punishing runs through red or even neutral cover hard enough.   So if the MG42 gets dialed back, the question that has to be answered is the performance of the Genadiere during the early game, as they simply are not capable of bearing that load alone."
CompanyOfHeroes,3c37hh,Snyggkille,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:17:46 2015 UTC,"Really? i usually have a standard layout of an Mg42. Three squads of grenadiers with Mg34's. If i send them on some conscripts they vet up and can eventually kill off a squad of shock troops rather fast. Though, i (and i strongly assume you too) want the cover to matter more. Neutral or bad cover? death be imminent."

Ardennes Assault is a standalone singleplayer campaign for the western front. The multiplayer component is sold separately in the Western Front Armies DLC, you can buy both the Oberkommando West and the US Forces separately and allows you to play these factions in multiplayer and skirmish games.  There's also the different Theater of War DLCs: Case Blue, Victory at Stalingrad and Southern Fronts, which are singleplayer mission packs focusing in specific scenarios, like the German summer offensive of 1942 and the Battle of Stalingrad.  Finally, you can also buy Commanders, Skins and Faceplates. All of these are optional and can be dropped during gameplay through the War Spoils system, although I wouldn't count on it. It should be noted that you can also buy them using the new in-game store which has DLC that can't be purchased anywhere else and features some discounted items once in a while."

You need to agressive with them, move tem up as often as possible and have them as close to the front line as possible.  As long as you have a squad of infantry ""in front"" of them for the enemy to focus on, they should be fine and lending support. And if that infantry squad inn front gets into trouble, start the mortar moving back ASAP. Don't simply retreat the inf then retreat the mortar all the way to base, too late.  With an MG nearby you can also ambush enemy units who tink they are going to be getting the jump on a tasty, defenseless mortar. Honestly, too many people try to use mgs and mortars as ""sit and forget"" weapons, whereas they excell more at sitting just behind the front line, being put into play when you have already pinpointed and engaged the enemy, then being moved again so the enemy cant get a fix on them.  Oh and NEVER FORGET SMOKE. So many points captured under the nose of enemy mgs. Your second point about assaults would have benfitted there. Smoke + flanking would get your men easily into the thick of the enemy, either out of firing arcs or within assault weapon murder range.

CompanyOfHeroes,3bwj5i,Mr_125,2,Thu Jul 2 22:09:45 2015 UTC,I would like this. The base army consisting mainly of Italian troops with maybe a couple of German armored units to fill out the roster. Then have commanders with a mix of Italian and German units.
CompanyOfHeroes,3bwj5i,The_Turk2,2,Fri Jul 3 02:42:51 2015 UTC,"They didn't neccessarily have to suck... I would personally love to have France and Italy be in the game; especially France.

CompanyOfHeroes,3bwj5i,Mandarion,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:51:46 2015 UTC,"Well that sucks. However as I wrote earlier, I think it would make sense to have an East Asian WW2 theatre game, be a standalone game. Because imagine if they could add in naval warfare..... drool   Because technically they only did say no to Japan in ""CoH2""."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bwj5i,BananaBork,2,Sat Jul 4 01:57:44 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, for sure. I was just super disappointed when I read that--COH 3 is years away at this point, and I feel like I'm just getting into COH 2 now, even though I've had it since launch.   Pacific theatre would be so unique, especially for Company of Heroes. I bought the Battlestations games on one of the Steam sales, hopefully that'll tide me over haha. But again the infantry combat is the real draw for me."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bwj5i,Mr_125,0,Sat Jul 4 08:58:38 2015 UTC,They would have to separate the multiplayer of those two factions (to counter the Japanese they would have to create a new American faction) because neither the Marines nor the Japanese would be able to properly compete with any late-game unit of the other factions.   Keep in mind that the Sherman was pretty much the heaviest thing that saw action in the Japanese part of WWII...
CompanyOfHeroes,3bwj5i,BananaBork,2,Fri Jul 3 11:02:51 2015 UTC,"because neither the Marines nor the Japanese would be able to properly compete with any late-game unit of the other factions.   For all you know this hypothetical Japanese faction would be able to mass-produce Type 4 tanks with stats like a King Tiger. It's a game that is already very much fantasy, not a history textbook.  The existing US faction with a unique commander would be a good enough approximation for Marines though, I don't want another USF with minor changes in terminology and units."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bwj5i,tipsy3000,3,Fri Jul 3 11:31:28 2015 UTC,"Might be the wrong crowd I'm playing to here, but Relic has been doing asymetrcal gameplay for a while now... I know Rising Storm has no armour to speak of, but the Japanese would be just as fearsome as an infantry heavy faction. They could take down tanks with mines or their big coastal guns, making use of heavy concealment, kind of like Luftwaffe troopers.  Of course it's all moot, though."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bwj5i,mrsteamfist,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:02:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I would be hoping for in such a faction. Rising Storm is a great example of asymmetry, and I love interesting infantry mechanics in CoH."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bwj5i,tipsy3000,2,Fri Jul 3 23:15:47 2015 UTC,"I am not sure why this keeps getting spat out. Italian generals were god awful and the Italian war machine was simply not prepared for the war of such scale. However several components of there military equipment were amazing and were even better then some German equipment.  Also I want them in to see the Carro Veloce L3/35 in game :3  The only real issue is heavy call-ins, which is where germany can help. Other wise they can easily have an entire core tree by themselves with no problem."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bwj5i,Bromao,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:05:43 2015 UTC,I agree.  I think Italians in would add an fun spam force to the game.  They can add a campaign over the blood boot too.
CompanyOfHeroes,3bwj5i,tipsy3000,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:36:05 2015 UTC,"Sounds like youd like them the same way they are in RUSE.   Excellent early game force with huge versatility and choice of armored and infantry units with production centers being cheaper then everyone else so you can get more units out earlier. Because of that and multiple cheap pre-war tanks they can spam so hard and overwhelm in sheer numbers early on. There is usually very little other factions can do prior to tech up unless your the French who are pretty much the only faction with serious early game armor or AT.   Then mid game you can modernize your force to stay in the game or to finish the enemy off. Convert those early 1930's tanks into modern M15's or up gun to Semoviente 90's (Imagine a maruder with a 88). You can also field modern squads Granatieri to replace your early light infantry, they have proper AT and modern rifles and sub-machineguns.

The comments in here are like those Starcraft 1 players who raged at the idea of being able to select more than 12 units.  I don't even want any gameplay changes, those assholes can still walk out the door and set up their MGs. I'd just like to be able to save a click and that fraction of a second of babysitting."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bvz5s,ThumbWarriorDX,2,Thu Jul 2 20:28:14 2015 UTC,"That would be very nice, knowing I have to watch them as they exit only for retreat while I could be doing something else is annoying."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bvz5s,TheBackfiringVirus,3,Thu Jul 2 21:08:04 2015 UTC,I'd rather be able to tell them which door to go out. Also if you click on the squad in the garrison you can tell them to exit and move to a place further from the door so you have time to tell them to retreat before they start setting up.
CompanyOfHeroes,3bvz5s,Nullclast,2,Thu Jul 2 18:56:08 2015 UTC,I think when you do the method you describe they actually take the closest exit to the destination I think.

CompanyOfHeroes,3bvz5s,Nullclast,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:06:06 2015 UTC,"Well, what's stopping the AI from choosing the door closest to the retreat point (in the case of a retreat from building option)? If it's the HQ, it'll find the door closest to the HQ and exit the infantry from there, if it's a Captain it'll find the door closest to the Captain and exit the infantry there, etc.  EDIT: Actually nevermind, I think I know what your concern is. I didn't properly read your other reply. Retreat paths can and will be stupid at times, but I think the ability to retreat infantry from inside buildings would ease some unnecessary micro (evacing the infantry, waiting for them to exit, then spamming the retreat button hoping a unit like the HMG won't set up again)."

CompanyOfHeroes,3bw584,Olekman,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:13:02 2015 UTC,"Similar to the Medical Supplies which can be built by Sturmpioniers. They are expensive, available only from vet 1 and pretty bad at healing. Basically useless.  Alas, Relic have their eyes on more important matters."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bw584,Olekman,4,Thu Jul 2 18:13:09 2015 UTC,"The medical supplies are actually useful when you don't have a battlegroup HQ. I've noticed that if a squad pick them up at full health, it will regen whenever it takes any damage out of combat so it doesn't get wasted. Still more useful."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bw584,Mandarion,3,Thu Jul 2 18:21:43 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind it being cheaper and available at vet 0 really. OKW has enough problems with munitions to spend 40 munitions for alternative to healing.  EDIT: Also, are you sure about that part about healing any damage they take out of combat? Isn't that just from Volksgrenadiers vet? They do get passive health regeneration at different vet levels."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bw584,Olekman,2,Thu Jul 2 18:32:08 2015 UTC,"The health packs of the Sturmpioniere heal a set amount of damage. If your unit is healed before that amount of HP has been healed, they will continue to heal after being damaged (once they get out of combat again). The ability should wear off after enough damage has been healed.  This makes these packs a bit more tactical, because they don't just heal your troops for a set amount of time (like the Ostheer), but their cost still makes them kind of pointless. If they were a 100 manpower investment they would be much more likely to be used, even with a Battlegroup Headquarter, simply because it can allow you to keep a higher field presence."

So set up your MGs and keep your Shermans a little behind them. Volks shoot shreks at MGs and get suppressed. So run your shermans in (HE loaded!) and go for the roadkill. You should get quite a few kills. On top of that, the blobber is prpbably going to retreat the entire blob at once. There goes the meat of his army! Time for some mischief."

Its hard to run a stuart up against a blob with like 2 schreks, and when they have at least 1 fussilier and 1 sturmpio its like the ultimate wrecking machine. Plus they'll occasionally throw a nade here or there that it makes it hard to really counteract. Then once they get some kind of armor out your really screwed."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bww9z,insaneHoshi,0,Sat Jul 4 18:55:09 2015 UTC,"cant see the problem, focus the sturmpios frist then go close in.

I think you can't see the tree in forest, it is easier to tell you those things that doesn't work: AT guns, rear echelons, Jacksons and wolverines.  As OKW you got way more problem with bobby USF, the solution is to ignore them, retreat where they come and recap everything with single units when they are gone."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bww9z,NosyOwl,-1,Sun Jul 5 12:41:01 2015 UTC,"Volks get outclassed so easily it's ridiculous. And their only weapon upgrade lowers their anti infantry power. If its just volks spam you should easily beat it with rifles + bars  If it's sturms, keep distance and bleed them, they don't scale amazingly with vet and they are slow/expensive to reinforce  If its obers/panzerfus, get vehichles. Both units are anti inf only, and the at nades for fus is sorta shitty  If its a multiple set up like you said, honestly a blob of 5 of your own should beat them. Any mix up of infantry with volks mixed in is inherently weaker. You can opt for airborne to rip them to shreds if you really want to as well  And if you ever see a support gun, its 430 manpower of slow inaccuracy. Its aoe is piss poor and it means less fighting units on the field. Be aggressive against it, and spread out units. Its hard to get the manpower to blob while making support guns because of their price"
CompanyOfHeroes,3bww9z,NosyOwl,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:13:36 2015 UTC,"4 stuart is good but not against like 2 fussiliers, 2 schrek volks, and 1 sturmpio.   I said that above. The fusiliers take out infantry pretty easily if not blobbed against, the sturmpios mop up, and the volks with schreks take out vehicles.  I didn't try bars as someone else mentioned. The only think I don't like is blobbing like a bitch to counteract the blob."

CompanyOfHeroes,3busv6,erik4848,3,Thu Jul 2 17:48:32 2015 UTC,"Mortars or snipers + guards. Snipers help against grens too, but the guards are vital to defend against 222 rush."
CompanyOfHeroes,3busv6,ultrasuper3000,6,Thu Jul 2 09:52:41 2015 UTC,"Try get a mortar quite early. Use smoke for pushes and flares once it reaches vet 1 so you don't run into mgs scouting and have to retreat.  I have been trying out a build, still needs some work. M5 with the quad mount is super strong right now. Shreds the 222, great damage and suppression, excellent against lone mgs, can chase them down effectively too. You can reinforce your squads (good for repopulating mgs it has killed) and you usually have a decent window before a p4 or stug come out. Use this window to put down a whole host of mines and hope/bait their first tank over one. If you can take out their first tank like this you should win. To play this strategy you have to be super diligent about getting your tech structure down ASAP to maximise the effect, even double build it if it's convenient. How I have been playing (roughly, map dependant): 3 x conscript, combat engineer which builds t2, mortar, maxim or elite inf (shock, guard), healing (situational), tier 3, half track (quad upgrade), zis, t34. Pair this with a doctrine with a heavy tank (ISU 152 or IS2) so probably shock rifle (good for pak blobs) shock motor heavy or mechanised support. Or if you are feeling trolly and they haven't gone CAS, try Terror tactics for ML-20 fun."
CompanyOfHeroes,3busv6,tightropexilo,3,Thu Jul 2 10:15:29 2015 UTC,"hate to say it because the other suggestions are great here, but I don't think a quadmount and a whole host of mines are compatible.   The quadmount still costs a pretty heft price in munitions- and I think if you go that route then you will have fuel for AT grenades and a Zis, but not enough munies to cover all possible routes with mines. BTW the new trick is to Zis first then AT nade (as opposed to the other way around before)"
CompanyOfHeroes,3busv6,F1SH_T4C0,2,Thu Jul 2 11:43:37 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about 4 mines on spots specifically aimed at taking out vehicles, close to your zis gun, I should have made that clearer but my post was already quite long. Easy to do munitions wise, especially if you haven't had to use many nades/smoke/zis barrage. The quad mount should afford you control of both munitions for a good spell of time too (map dependant) Don't try a munitions cache though, you wont have enough manpower."

MGs are fairly simple to deal with if you have two squads of conscripts.  Keep them separate from each other.  One gets pinned down the other flanks and flames.  If you just can't pull the flank off, let them have the land for a while and attack elsewhere.  I see this happen so often sometimes they have entrenched an area so well the loss of manpower to take it isn't worth the land.  It is okay to abandon a portion of the map, and help an attack going on someplace else."

He ended pulling off a lot of fishy plays, which prompted Romeo to ask about 10 of us top players what our thoughts were on a specific match that he stopped livecasting halfway through because of how obvious the fishyness was.  None of us gave a 100% verdict since we cant see exactly what dbmb was doing, where his camera view was, etc. Plus, we still remember him as the hacker, and personally I dont think anyone who was banned for hacking should be allowed to play in any tournaments, cleaned up or not."

CompanyOfHeroes,3borp4,basedyonder,2,Wed Jul 1 12:57:05 2015 UTC,lol that would die with like 1 tank shell!
CompanyOfHeroes,3borp4,basedyonder,3,Wed Jul 1 14:11:57 2015 UTC,So exactly like the Katyusha and the Panzerwerfer?
CompanyOfHeroes,3borp4,Fimconte,0,Wed Jul 1 18:15:08 2015 UTC,Depens on the tank. T34 and Pzr4 take 2 (1 pretty much kills it but its still alive).
CompanyOfHeroes,3borp4,basedyonder,2,Wed Jul 1 18:23:26 2015 UTC,Wrong. Both the Katyusha and Panzerwerfer have 160 hp. Both the T-34/76 and Panzer IV deal 160 damage with their main gun.

CompanyOfHeroes,3borp4,Coldstripe,7,Wed Jul 1 02:51:07 2015 UTC,I suspect it will not be as effective as a kat at bombarding and not as good as a standard Sherman in combat while being more expensive.  My gut is on it will cost muni to bombard
CompanyOfHeroes,3borp4,himmelgeist,6,Wed Jul 1 05:46:29 2015 UTC,The calliope in coh1 didn't fire its main gun only bombarded
CompanyOfHeroes,3borp4,ultrasuper3000,6,Wed Jul 1 06:12:51 2015 UTC,Only after patching. The first versions of the unit could use the turret.
CompanyOfHeroes,3borp4,metatron5369,8,Wed Jul 1 08:09:46 2015 UTC,And it was glorious. Hoping they don't disable the main gun for this one
CompanyOfHeroes,3borp4,HauntedGrass,2,Wed Jul 1 09:12:14 2015 UTC,Yes... yes it was. Loved calling it in.
CompanyOfHeroes,3borp4,SleepDeprivedPegasus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:25:25 2015 UTC,I think it should only be able to use its turret after it fires its rockets (I think this happened IRL as well IIRC). There would be a manual reload on the rockets as well.
CompanyOfHeroes,3borp4,Charismaztex,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:42:20 2015 UTC,It could use its turret in CoH:O as well-- though firing the rockets had a munitions cost associated.
CompanyOfHeroes,3borp4,Nullclast,3,Wed Jul 1 13:43:03 2015 UTC,"So hyped for that, coh1 calliope was game changing - you could lose most of the game then get one of these out and stage a comeback. Absolute monster.  Even better was bringing them to the Scheldt and ruining a team of axis Scheldt-only-team-stacking player's day. You want to walking stuka for half an hour then roll in with panthers? Well my team's 6 calliOPs would like a word. Once got a guy to ragequit by just firing all into his base and knocking out his HQ in one."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bnc4d,TehBrownSheep,14,Tue Jun 30 16:32:10 2015 UTC,That's awesome. Make sure you build at least 10 Shermans so it's an even fight.
CompanyOfHeroes,3bnc4d,luger33,3,Tue Jun 30 16:43:28 2015 UTC,You should post this to /r/Warthunder as well. They'd love to see this.

CompanyOfHeroes,3bnc4d,AlmightyGman,2,Tue Jun 30 16:36:20 2015 UTC,Wow. Very impressive!
CompanyOfHeroes,3bnc4d,HauntedGrass,2,Tue Jun 30 16:39:41 2015 UTC,"looks quite good, but at the eyes you messed up a little. Maybe you could use an old brush and cut it down to a few hairs. Also working with thin washes can help, you will just need to paint it a few more times then. Its hard work but in the end it'll be worth!  Drybrush the hair with a little brighter colour and ink the flesh with maybe a mix of dark brown, red and grey then paint the accents again.   The Tank itself looks awesome, dont get upset by my improvement proposals, but i invested way to much time in such things a few years ago."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bnc4d,Tetracyclon,2,Tue Jun 30 17:00:55 2015 UTC,Hey dude thanks for the tips! Will be sure to try that for the next figure build. Thanks for the feedback dude.
CompanyOfHeroes,3bnc4d,Mandarion,2,Tue Jun 30 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"Just two small things: German tank crews of the Wehrmacht didn't wear any camouflaged uniforms, from 1934 on they wore black uniforms with a Totenkopf in place of the Kragenspiegel (a reference to the Black Riders who wore black uniforms and had the deathshead as their symbol, which was taken over by the first tank crews during WWI).  The Schirmmütze the officer is wearing was part of the parade uniform (Parade- und Dienstanzug) and wasn't to be worn when inside a tank, instead the Schutzmütze, a cap similar to a beret, or Schiffchen (as correctly worn by the rest of the tank crew) were part of the field uniform."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bnc4d,TensaiOni,2,Tue Jun 30 22:19:48 2015 UTC,Cool information dude! I just did whatever the kit told me to do for the uniforms.. But thanks for your research!
CompanyOfHeroes,3bnc4d,EliasDL,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:06:09 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure that Schutzmütze (the beret) was used early in the war (it was being replaced by other types of headgear in 1940/1941). Despite they were phased out, they could still be worn by some crews - it was probably very uncommon though.  As for the camouflaged uniforms - it's true that Wehrmach (unlike Waffen-SS) didn't issue such uniforms to tank crews, but nothing stopped crews from purchasing/making/etc. and wearing such uniforms anyway. Ther's also photographic evidence of that happening."

CompanyOfHeroes,3bo25d,internet-arbiter,2,Wed Jul 1 08:42:27 2015 UTC,I don't i've ever seen her post anything informative about the game. The entire time she was community manager she said a lot without saying anything at all.
CompanyOfHeroes,3bo25d,Johnny_G93,2,Wed Jul 1 11:30:37 2015 UTC,CMs deal with what devs and management give them. If anything she did a great job with what little she had. I hope that Relic will be more open in the future.
CompanyOfHeroes,3bo25d,Gdott,5,Wed Jul 1 15:04:58 2015 UTC,"I love the white knights of coh2. Honestly, I don't blame them, they never experienced a quality CM. She knew nothing about the game, she rarely involved the community until she was called out of coh2.org. Why do people miss her? Because she put emojis in the patch notes? Putting a female in charge of the community was the greatest move relic ever made. We went from holding accountability to every teenage boner trying to be her online boyfriend. The amount of agreement with relic went up exponentially . Not going to miss her, sorry lads."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bo25d,Johnny_G93,3,Wed Jul 1 20:15:15 2015 UTC,"I don't remember ANY other CM from ANY other game (well, Scarper and BatiDari from WarThunder). If you want to blame her for Relic's lack of communication then be my guest. CM doesn't need to have top level knowledge of the game. This position is used as a mean of communication between playerbase and developers and enough said IMO she was doing a great job with what little she had been given. As you said, her announcements were humorous and she didn't talk to us in stiff corporate langauge. She tried to talk with people on official forums and was in general nice. If you want to be an asshole just because she happens to be a woman then I can't stop you I guess.   tips fedora /s"
CompanyOfHeroes,3bo25d,Gdott,-1,Wed Jul 1 21:29:38 2015 UTC,"Heh. White knight arrived.   CM's should know the game they are representing. Relaying information to the community on the official forums is about the least effective way to reach the 'actual' community. We brought this to her attention, but she stated something along the lines of, 'shes paid to use official forums and doesn't have the time to repost on coh2.org' or even this sub (because ctrl-c/v is really difficult). Her job was to communicate with the community, doing this basic task as community manager does not merit a superb performance report.   I agree with you that she certainly had her hands tied and is told what she can do and say (shes a punching bag really) - but to put her up on a pedestal for doing the bare minimum of her job and crowning her as this great martyr CM is laughable. This community has organized more events in a single month than her entire tenure.   Her being a female has nothing to do with the ability to preform her job. I was referring to the communities reaction to a woman in charge, please do not twist my words.   *edit: you removed the bit about me being sexist, thank you."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bo25d,christobevii3,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:48:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I still don't understand how she didn't know what guard motor meta was.  I'd say hire Romeo but he got jaded from the game recently and has gotten into that new Arc dinosaur game."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bo25d,Johnny_G93,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:14:22 2015 UTC,I didnt remove anything so don't lie. In the edit I sarcastically tipped you my fedora which I probably wear in your imagination. If I can't defend her and voice my opinion without being called a white knight on the internet then so be it. Why do you say that her gender doesn't matter when on this point you dismiss my opinion of her as a CM is beyond me. I have my view on this and you have yours. If you want to start some bullshit SJW crap throwing contest then do so without me.   Edit: Forgot to thank you for always classy namecalling. That's how I'm reminded not to give a shit on the internet.

CompanyOfHeroes,3bo25d,ObiCyn_RE,0,Thu Jul 2 17:54:41 2015 UTC,I like how in the last stream she did when Romeo asked her if she knew about the guard motor meta being dominate she deflected the question saying she'd have to ask someone else since she wasn't familiar with it.  It seems like every time they stream the people haven't even played the game that make it.
CompanyOfHeroes,3bo25d,COH-CIV-TW,3,Wed Jul 1 13:29:10 2015 UTC,"I can understand this criticism, and I'm going to address it directly. I am not familiar with the intricate details of the game as much as I would have liked to be, my energy and effort was focused on my direct role which has kept me very busy. It has not afforded me much time to play the game, but I do play it - and quite enjoy it when I get the chance to. It doesn't mean I care any less. I've been a gamer since my dad first introduced me to Pac-Man on his DOS computer, so I understand where your passion comes from.   I've advised that the next person coming in should be granted more time and training with the game before being thrown into everything :)   I had hoped to do a series of twitch streams where I went through and 'learned' more with the community, but people generally complain if our twitch broadcasts don't involve 'top grade' play - and our dev team is much better at the game than I am, by far. No one at Relic knows everything, and even some of our designers (single player as an example) would not be able to answer the guard motor meta question - because it's not their area of expertise. The game is large, intricate and requires many subject matter experts to do their thing in order to bring it to life.  I'll have more time to play COH2 in my spare time now, and perhaps one day I will eventually suck less ;) One can hope!"

CompanyOfHeroes,3bsroe,24CharacterLimit,4,Wed Jul 1 21:41:15 2015 UTC,"More likely yes based on routine mechanic repetition, but if both of you on average win similar amounts of games against similar opponents it is likely you are at a very close skill level. Now your particular proficiencies may vary because of time played, but figuring you and your opponent's strengths out is all part of the game. I've won a good few games against people I know are 100% better at micromanagement of units in small skirmishes and committing to strong macro build decisions by taking advantage of what they lack in timed aggression and innovative attacking angles. In any case, unless Relic starts recording every player's every movement and grading a myriad of skills to match up players it is unlikely we are going to see deep play time mismatches disappear, especially in a game with a reasonably small following like this."
CompanyOfHeroes,3br7k5,Gdott,-2,Wed Jul 1 14:25:49 2015 UTC,Just because someone can win against something doesn't mean it is balanced.  If 4 new players coming to the game played Axis and their first 9 matches were against teams ranked from 10 to 2. Then their final match they played against the Top Team and lost. Their skill isn't being reflected very well. They are being skill boosted so to say.

I mean sure 4 squads rushing at an MG42 might end up killing it but every faction has that problem.  I don't understand why Ostheer now gets to be the only faction exempt from that.  1120mp shouldn't be countered by 240mp.    If a blob surprised me I would retreat safely and then cap elsewhere until I was ready to engage the blob on my terms.  A single MG42 was enough to slow down the blob for LMG grens to get the advantage and pick it apart.  I would also kite it with P4s or mortar halftrak flame strike, my personal favorite.  Even if the blob pushed me back they would take heavy losses and with USF still bleeding manpower like crazy they would usually be crippled.

CompanyOfHeroes,3bifru,nichts_neues,4,Mon Jun 29 16:37:44 2015 UTC,"""1120mp shouldn't be countered by 240mp""  Of course it should. 1120mp poorly used should not win against anything (in this MG suppression context). Just because you purchase 1120mp doesn't give you carte blanche to win against anything of lesser value. Mines are only 30-60 munitions and they are responsible for so much carnage against expensive vehicles.  I think 1120mp of blobbed rifles running at an MG is a poor application of resources. It'd make more sense to spend 840mp on rifles and the rest on smoke and grenades, or caches for that matter."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bifru,anon4773,4,Mon Jun 29 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"K, ever see an Allied MG counter 1120mp?  Especially after the rifle nades start coming I really don't think it is possible.  Also all allied mgs other than the atrocious maxim come out sometimes 5 minutes later than the OP42s.    Mines are a different category entirely.

Yes, MGs are a huge obstacle, and are probably too cheap. But the way they perform makes sense to me. I think there are plenty of tools to overcome them however."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bifru,F1SH_T4C0,9,Mon Jun 29 21:45:58 2015 UTC,Rifle grenades are the easiest tool to use.  You can literaly wipe an MG with only one of them.  I just did it twice in one game.

CompanyOfHeroes,3bj04s,Tetracyclon,5,Mon Jun 29 16:53:21 2015 UTC,Thought there were always two planes.
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj04s,Orestes910,2,Mon Jun 29 17:27:28 2015 UTC,"The P-47 rocket strafes calls two P-47s to perform strafe runs. They usually strike in quick succession when they acquire a target but it's possible for both to attack at the same time. Also, yeah, the rocket strafe is pretty powerful and can easily kill enemy armor, it's especially powerful against Tigers and the like because they represent a big and slow target so incoming rockets hit directly more often."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj04s,basedyonder,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:58:17 2015 UTC,Well i never managed to call in two planes!?  We are talking about the airborne doc right?
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj04s,Duder211,5,Mon Jun 29 17:46:19 2015 UTC,It's always been 2 planes. Have you not shot 1 down only to have another come back in and do another run?
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj04s,SrpskaZemlja,2,Mon Jun 29 18:07:45 2015 UTC,"It hasn't always been 2, an update made it since it sucked before."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj04s,24CharacterLimit,5,Mon Jun 29 18:09:35 2015 UTC,thx tried it again. Two planes as intended.
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj04s,luger33,2,Mon Jun 29 18:17:45 2015 UTC,"My question on it in general is what is the range of the planes. Maybe I am not paying full attention but I have had smoke go down in one sector, I run my tanks away, maybe not out of the sector initially and get hit by the first pass, but by the time of subsequent passes I am several sectors away and those bastard still seem to hunt me down. Do they just during the first pass target anything in the target radius per the ability description, and in subsequent passes seek their previous targets out no matter where they are?  Or would I be able to counterplay by leaving some sort of cheap light vehicle in the initially targeted area to draw the later strikes?  Using Ostwinds or flak trucks to shoot down the planes scares me way to much still even after the downed plane accuracy was dropped. For whatever reason since P47s are making a strafe low and quick to hit rockets on my tanks, if I shoot them out of the air their trajectory seems to remain targeted at my tanks and the impact is far worse. Hashtag Ostwind shot down a P47 that wasnt going to kill a tiger, P47 then lands on tiger killing it. The sadness."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj04s,24CharacterLimit,2,Mon Jun 29 18:50:44 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind the P-47 is a hard counter to Axis heavy armor, which the US lacks except Jacksons and maybe shooting them in the ass w/ Zooks. It's also one of (if not the?) most expensive abilities in the game."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj04s,Ragman676,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:42:13 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I tell myself that every time it gets used on me lol. Though now that heavies are limited, Jacksons used with a semblance of an idea of their strengths and one real weakness are devastating to Axis armor. Avoid running headlong into Stugs or at guns with them and you are going to shit stomp any Axis armor blob. But hey, I guess that is my bias showing."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj04s,basedyonder,2,Tue Jun 30 16:47:46 2015 UTC,"Ya, you pretty much have to save a ton of munitions to use the 47's, and that's not always easy as airborne. Late game getting lmg's for the para drop costs 120, and you really want those as it makes them one of the best, if not the best infantry in the game. Not to mention you spam grenades pretty often in the early game, and any weapons you buy your troops cost 60. So at a (240-260?) munitions cost, and a 12 point ability, you rarely get to spam it unless you've saved the entire game. Also park your tanks by trees and buildings and they will absorb a volley or 2. I find it rare they ever take out a tiger, though that might be different since the patch. Jacksons are great, but require way more micro than any german armor, they are paper thin and one wrong move can get them killed in a couple blows."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj04s,erik4848,0,Tue Jun 30 22:41:29 2015 UTC,"The big circle is actually just a target acquiring range indicator. Once a plane has locked on a target, unless the plane is destroyed, the strafe will happen no matter what.  In the particular situation you're describing it's probably something like this: the tank was inside the targeting radius, a plane locks on it, and even if the tank moves outside of the circle, the strafe will happen."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj04s,basedyonder,2,Mon Jun 29 22:20:43 2015 UTC,"It works like this: the smoke comes down, the planes come in, they aquire a random target tank that's in the red circle and will shoot at it, if the target tank leaves the red circle after the first strafe the planes will circle the red circle and will shoot at any tank that comes within the circle."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj04s,Kubelecer,0,Tue Jun 30 07:04:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. It should be noted though that if a target is locked on, the strafe will happen even if the target leaves the circle. Of course, following strafes will not happen if the target is outside the circle, as a the target won't be locked if it is outside of the circle."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj04s,BarrierX,0,Tue Jun 30 16:41:31 2015 UTC,"No, they only shoot what's inside the circle"

CompanyOfHeroes,3bk0gs,Katter,2,Tue Jun 30 03:40:56 2015 UTC,"The old drop system had problems too. A lot of them were just a grind, and you'd have to use units in ways that you wouldn't really want to. But the current drop system is kinda cruel. Not enough drops, too many duplicates, too many worthless bulletins and not enough commanders etc. Here's to hoping they overhaul it and never make another game with such an unsatisfying mechanic (because otherwise I really enjoy the game most of the time)."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj416,Wiggs1,3,Mon Jun 29 17:22:16 2015 UTC,2v2: win before the 20min mark or start crying during the late game.   3v3: i hope you don't have more than 2 USF.

CompanyOfHeroes,3bj416,HonJudgeFudge,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:36:33 2015 UTC,I agree - that is typically how I go as well.  The problem I find is that the early map control that is gained from MGs in the buildings is hard to overcome.  Especially on that map where the buildings are not easily destroyed.  The new suppression buff makes it quite tough.
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj416,Mandarion,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:42:40 2015 UTC,"Go for grenades ASAP. Use the smoke, it is practically the direct counter.   If you use the Assault Engineers, try to place demo charges on important buildings. If you use Rifle Company, use the flamethrowers on your riflemen to set fire to buildings - just burn it long enough to ignite the building, it will come crashing down after a while."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bj416,m00m00Farm,2,Mon Jun 29 19:10:44 2015 UTC,Agree with grenades.  I always tech to grenades as soon as possible (I always did this even before the patch) - and they work wonderfully on open maps.  Problem with rifle flamethrower and pack Howi is that they arrive later in the game.

As I said, on some units it is incredibly useful and powerful (moving your troops back to the front at top speed is a really powerful ability, as it gives you much more field presence).  Sadly, other units don't profit from it at all, because vetting them up is impossible in the role they are used in and in the state they are in at vet0 (which is justified by Relic by how good the units become at vet5, which is incredibly dumb because they never get there)..."

On top of that, there is no reason for OKW to go for the King Tiger, despite what many players believe. It is basically just an IS-2 that costs significantly more and doesn't give you much to justify that price.

CompanyOfHeroes,3bg3zd,nicksam112,2,Sun Jun 28 22:46:58 2015 UTC,"Does smoke cost munitions? I was having -horrible- munition shortages that match specifically, so smoke wouldn't really work in that situation.  More importantly, where do you smoke? In front, on the unit?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3bg3zd,luger33,4,Sun Jun 28 23:09:44 2015 UTC,"IMO smoke is one of the most important and underused unit abilities. It can really be a game changer when dealing w/ Axis MGs.   You get smoke w/ frags when you purchase the HQ upgrade. They do cost munitions, but not much, and you should have enough early in the game when dealing w/ MGs to use them fairly consistently since artillery and weapon upgrades come a little bit later.  Smoke pretty much directly in front of the MG to block as much of its LOS as possible. Then flank. This is best performed w/ two squads of rifles moving in opposite directions, so even if he pins one or repositions, you can still get the drop on the MG."

We can pop smoke whenever we want since our base infantry squad is all that will see combat  I hate to say it, but MG's should be the least of USF's problems"
CompanyOfHeroes,3bg3zd,redditors_r_manginas,3,Mon Jun 29 04:01:22 2015 UTC,"Axis can make as many squads as USF.  If an MG is supported by another OP42 then it is pretty hard to dislodge and getting a squad caught for a second will drop a lot of health.  Not to mention the suppression now keeps riflemen on the ground forever before they can get up and move through the smoke they lay down.    Why Relic rolled out the MG buffs without giving USF counters is stupid and is no way to run a strategy game.  One side shouldn't be relegated to carefully scouting, always running converging flanking routes, and spending resources to move across the map while the other side just sets up units to block off half of the map.  One is significantly more work than the other and USF still has lategame trouble.   With super pio sight you can scout flanks and reposition to shut down a flanking squad and force a retreat.  Repositioning after smoke isn't too hard and will bleed munis from USF.    USF is already the most micro intensive faction and the MG changes just make things worse.  Relic is out of their mind."
CompanyOfHeroes,3bg3zd,Cageshep,6,Mon Jun 29 04:18:24 2015 UTC,"If you can nab a replay I'd be happy to help. I enjoy all the factions of coh2, rifleman smoking doesnt even require flanking, if you got two MG's covering each other you can smoke the first MG with squad A and still use squad A to throw a frag grenade at the set up position. from there your rifleman should be able to clean up the first MG. best of all smokes are super cheap. if you want to really get through a defense you can use a 2nd rifleman squad to pop another smoke  another thing you have to realize is two MG42's covering each other is a LOT of manpower in one area of the map, Rear echelon should be free to cap any point. it is a bit of a shame that USF requires a lot of micro compared to the other factions however I feel like they make up for it by having such a versatile unit (except for AT cause bazookas cant pen shit :D)"

CompanyOfHeroes,3bape2,porkgremlin,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:47:01 2015 UTC,Wrong on many counts. OKW has 66% fuel income. That means all OKW fuel costs are 1.5 times more (66% x 1.5 = 100%). Double P4J call-in is 315 (157.5 each) adjusted fuel cost. Not very efficient compared to Ostheer.

And it also has a very WIDE scatter area. So the chances that you will actually be able to kill things, aren't that high. It's like a 50/50 chance of doing alot of damage."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b9jhs,Fikaknugz,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:10:14 2015 UTC,"so , save 300 munis, get into a fight with an opponent with a lot of infantry, hopefully make him run, and drop the HE on their base."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b9jhs,Malaysia_flight_370,2,Sat Jun 27 18:49:51 2015 UTC,"You could already do this with existing commanders though for cheaper.  Hell, the worst offender is the Soviet Anti-Infantry commander, which gives you air recon and incendiary artillery to do just that, and costs only 200 munitions (recon 80, incendiary 120) and doesn't have a random scatter area."

CompanyOfHeroes,3b9jhs,Snyggkille,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:50:09 2015 UTC,I guess the Munitions Blitz + Heinkel run make the same endless cascade like the CAS doc or Osttruppen doc.
CompanyOfHeroes,3b9jhs,Tetracyclon,2,Sat Jun 27 17:40:22 2015 UTC,"I'd guess that the Heinkel costs a ton, takes a one heck of a time to reload.The munitions blitz most likely slows down manpower very much.

CompanyOfHeroes,3b9jhs,Snyggkille,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:06:03 2015 UTC,But i would shit on my infantry when i can bomb your base permanetly into pieces.  Or think of this: Make them retreat maybe with your incendenary mortar then call in your bombing run leaving the enemy with just nothing left not even buildings depending of the strength of this run. But since it needs 12 points i guess it should have been pretty painfull.

CompanyOfHeroes,3bbfct,redditors_r_manginas,3,Sat Jun 27 17:24:50 2015 UTC,Dont worry about spelling. Right now the soviets are being redisgined to rely less on call ins. you will see a lot less heavy tanks and a larger focus on the light and medium tanks. The game as a whole is being transition and the brits are one the way thanks to a few leaks and a destroyed glider in a map. Soviets still flood the field but axis can be played all reactive and have hard counters to all ally options. that coupled with OKW makes the axis factions synergize pretty well. Just keep with the game an be open to both factions and new strategys.

CompanyOfHeroes,3b955g,sojou,2,Sat Jun 27 00:00:56 2015 UTC,"Do it this way.  Lend lease, get the m5 call in (preferably after you've built T4) and an SU-85 (or 76 if thats your thing, I prefer getting a vetted SU85 since they can carry games stupidly). Need fuel? Drop that shit in base.  The guards are still kind of a waste (27mp reinforce, mixed svts/ppshes, normal guards a better) but you don't have to build T3 to rely on the somewhat mediocre t34s.   Congrats, you now have a diverse army and the ability to somewhat counter CAS which you will see almost every game. Plus, on field reinforcement when stealing all the juicy weapons crews.  Edit: Plus I completely forgot, you also get to spam in the Easy Eight Lite. Better than T34s."

CompanyOfHeroes,3b77vg,THHanson,8,Fri Jun 26 15:07:25 2015 UTC,Rec files are used only by the game and I assume they are the exact copy of all the commands that were given during the game.  The game just executes these commands in a new game basically. This also means that you cant scroll through the replay when watching. If you want to see minute 30 you have to watch everything before which is highly  inconvenient.  So if you want to have it in a video format you need software to record the screen and convert to a desired format.

CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,CyriusBloodbane,3,Thu Jun 25 19:36:18 2015 UTC,"You can only field one call in tank now, so I think its referring to the fact that you have to field units like the t34-76s instead of 3 IS2s.  But that's a guess"
CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,Ironcl4d,15,Thu Jun 25 19:37:45 2015 UTC,"And that the King Tiger is not included in the ""Only 1""-rule. Not that it would change anything, because a game featuring two King Tigers from the same player at the same time would mean that you did some terrible shit before that point. It also doesn't take into account that the King Tiger in its current state performs worse than the IS-2 for double the amount of resources.   The only group that got truly fucked are the USF players, because now they will surely get to see more Panthers, which out of all the Axis tanks are still the worst thing to fight against as USF. A tank that has the same mobility as your own tank destroyers and can actually take a hit and fire back?  I mean, a Tiger or King Tiger are like a present for any decent USF player, those things are slow and can easily be kited around the map if you know what you're doing and scout with infantry and use mines. A single Jackson is enough to keep a Tiger locked down and in constant need of repairs. A Panther on the other hand will be able to run up to your Jackson and bang the drivers' head against the nearest tree while laughing maniacally."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,CyriusBloodbane,9,Thu Jun 25 19:52:39 2015 UTC,I play soviets and even then I personally worry more about the panthers because they so easily escape scenarios where other tanks would die.
CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,AdlfHtlersFrznBrain,2,Thu Jun 25 20:02:07 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree. I don't know what is up with the devs that they always turn a blind eye to the Panther, hell they even gave it buffs in the past when it was already insanely hard to deal with.  Massive mobility, range, and toughness... it's only weakness is infantry which hardly even matters since it gets the pintle MG42 and Allies' AT infantry is all garbage."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,Mandarion,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:58:07 2015 UTC,Like the tactic is smoke that engine then close in with tanks.  Not very realistic though.
CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,Bromao,6,Fri Jun 26 03:01:49 2015 UTC,"The main issue with USF is that lack of mines, MGs and Mortar. There is no way to consolidate any territory at all. Dislodging Pak screen and MG42s is another issue as well. You need pack howtizer thats inaccurate and then at best tech up and use spare fuel to get a motor carriage which is paper thin again. Just extremely frustrating."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,Ninjapotatoe99,4,Thu Jun 25 21:00:21 2015 UTC,"The USF has the best mines in the game. Sure, it's bound to a vehicle, but it is still the best mine in the game and not bound to any doctrine or something like that (yes, they don't have infantry mines, but looking at what kind of shit the Ostheer infantry mines are that's not a bad thing).  The .50-cal also isn't really bad, it's just not really unique and ends up as a mixture of the MG42 and the Maxim.   The problem the USF has right now, is that it can't receive any major buffs without having them roflstomp everything (and the OKW already has massive problems in dealing with the early power of rifle squads) but also sits in a weird spot of being lacklustre. It can deal with practically anything, but at the same time it does so by doing the same stuff over and over and over again. The idea of the officers is nice, but in return the lack of normal infantry that is not a rifle squad or an officer is just booooooooooooring..."

CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,relkin43,0,Fri Jun 26 15:28:23 2015 UTC,KT is easily outranged by allied TD's
CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,Holyhitman173,3,Fri Jun 26 15:01:07 2015 UTC,"It's a tank going up against a Tank Destroyer, it has to have some sort of advantage against it, the axis have the elephant and jagdtiger for heavy TD's, stug's and jagdpanzer for light TD's, the panther is a tank destroyer tank it has slightly more range than a regular tank but makes up for it in speed and armour."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,Hazardousking,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:17:25 2015 UTC,I'm not saying it's unreasonable I'm just saying that the KT isn't this OP monolith that people like to pretend it is.  M36's with forward eyes from infantry or scouts or w/e can wreck them fairly easy without too much micro.  imo for the cost on OKW which is a fuel starved faction which gets negative modifiers on incoming fuel its just not cost-effective is what I'm driving at as a whole.  I don't understand why people complain about KT's so much...
CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,Holyhitman173,2,Fri Jun 26 15:26:25 2015 UTC,"Well it fairs well against tanks and clears infantry, trying to kill it with tanks or infantry is suicide a lot of the time due to its great all round performance similar to the tiger. a weakness to tank destroyers is very reasonable, especially if the KT manages to catch up to the TD it will deal considerable damage to it."

CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,Holyhitman173,9,Fri Jun 26 06:30:08 2015 UTC,"Except you shouldn't bring up real life equivalents especially in more arcade style games, other wise I could say ""for same price as a KT I can purchase 20 T34's"" and tanks at the end of the war had brittle armour from not having enough additives so for anything with a decent size gun it became who hits who first."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,Mandarion,2,Fri Jun 26 07:05:45 2015 UTC,I love everything about world war 2 I'm a huge nerd about it and when I play a game that is dedicated to the war I enjoy the fact that I need about 5 easy 8s to knock out a KT. Or making some booby trapped intersection to knock him out and take him or with infantry. Makes me feel special.  Or if I'm OKW I enjoy having and panther or KT or JT and being able the micro manage it and do very well with it.
CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,Holyhitman173,2,Fri Jun 26 17:14:51 2015 UTC,"This is silly, German tanks were over engineered and were prone to frequent mechanical failures. If we want to make it equivalent, why not have their engine or transmission fail going up a slight incline?"

CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,Holyhitman173,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:08:44 2015 UTC,Russian tanks also suffered from mechanical complications in the beginning of the war. I have had no problem taking out a KT with two Su85s. Granted the t34/76 is garbage but the 34/85 is decent.   The KT it slow and you use that to your advantage.   And now we can only have one Jagdtiger which sounds pretty decent to me since I formally use it as a defensive unit anyway.
CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:11:41 2015 UTC,"In its recent renditions, the T34/76 actually is pretty okay for its price. It is actually en par with the Panzer IV, which is supposed to be its main opponent.   Up close, both tanks are absolutely equal, while the T34/76 enjoys a bit more efficiency against infantry."

CompanyOfHeroes,3b3prk,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:54:34 2015 UTC,"The problem with close range fights is, that most of them happen on the move. Due to the penalty for firing on the move, more shots may miss than usually."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b6545,GeneralOstwind,15,Fri Jun 26 07:46:23 2015 UTC,"The side getting double teamed needs to stall and make as strong a defense as possible without heavy losses.   The other side spreads and caps ASAP while moving mid.  Any holds on the double teamed side will mean a resource advantage.   As the double side pushes, they will leave themselves a growing open flank. Eventually you should be in a position where they are up against a fortified position with an exposed rear. As soon as they over commit, engage the flank and push up the fortified front.  If the map allows for it, go for cut offs.  Their deep push will also allow you to reinforce with better tech faster.  The absolute key is not trying to take engagements you will lose. No need to take much territory on the 2v1 side at all."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b6545,ASesz,2,Fri Jun 26 08:31:05 2015 UTC,"The worst mistake is trying to defend 1v2 and pick bad engagements where you take losses, green cover is irrelevant when you get flushed out of there anyway. Map control is valuable, but so is your ability to take it back. Unless you got several mg42 (and flanks secured), just chill until they turn around. Let your friend know they're coming for him next."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b6545,Forgiven12,2,Fri Jun 26 08:45:44 2015 UTC,"Retreat.   Never lose units holding ground. Ground can be retakem, units can't.  If your mgs arent readt to hold, just get out of there. The more your teammate caps on the other side, the less you will be pressured"

CompanyOfHeroes,3b6545,Tetracyclon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:21:48 2015 UTC,"I would suggest having a plan ahead of time for how to support each other. If you start the game thinking you'll each hold one side, one of you is likely to get crushed. It might mean that your partner just supplies an MG, or a mortar to help out mid. Or it might mean that you both should push together and mostly ignore one side. This is especially true when one side has both fuels or both munitions.  As you move into the midgame, if the enemy is ignoring one side, keep a token force of infantry there and use vehicles to support the side which is double teamed, since vehicles can respond more quickly."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b6545,Katter,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:04:27 2015 UTC,Tie them up as long as possible while your ally grabs the rest of the map - if that's not possible you need to minimise your losses and quickly reinforce your ally to ensure he is not 2v1'd in turn.

My sources as well as files in the game make it seem like they are coming.  every ability has a price and a value. I think they will break apart pre made commanders (such as DLC commanders) and let you use their art work( the cool pictures) and their abilitys to make a custom commander. They would also explain why there are collipe (and)  rockets as well as a Pershing model floating around.  Of course this is all speculation based on stuff I've seen but just no CoH2 is far from dead.

CompanyOfHeroes,3b2nyg,cplcarlman,29,Thu Jun 25 14:02:16 2015 UTC,"I play as Allies and my latest strategy has been to continually lose games to the Axis. Sometimes I play as Soviets and build T1 so that my scout cars get killed almost immediately.  Other times I build T2 so that my Maxims with their amazingly narrow cone of fire get flanked. This usually results in a retreat that causes them all to die because they keep stopping whenever a squad member gets killed. Either of these strategies works great as a prelude to T4 which features the Katyusha and its time-release rocket barrage capable of damaging multiple square yards of uninhabited area. Also the SU85 works wonderfully to raise the Axis armor insurance rates with its hail-like damage output. Any of these strategies work great in 1v1 through 4v4 games. Eventually,  I hope that these strategies will lower my ELO to the point that I'm playing against only mentally challenged noobs or compulsive masturbaters that can only play with one hand at a time."

At some point I get medics and AT grenades, and molotovs if necessary. Vs OKW I tend to go with a commander that lets me put PPShs on the Conscripts so that they demolish Volks better, and vs Wehr I tend to go with a commander that lets me call in a big fucking tank, because you never know when you'll need a big fucking tank to back up your AT grenades, AT guns, and T-34s.

Just hold out with mass team weapons and snipers then let loose the tide of tanks.   i've really been struggling with OKW though. This faction is balls and their combined arms are also balls.

CompanyOfHeroes,3b2nyg,cradledcat,4,Thu Jun 25 21:00:27 2015 UTC,"OKW 1v1 is by far and away the weakest faction. Terrible indirect fire, the weakest core unit (volks) in the game, no way to counter sniper, and all the things that made them good got nerfed leaving them a zero synergy army with random shitty income  They only shine in teamgames where ostheer can carry them till they get units that don't actually suck ass"

The new SU-76's are glorious with some veteran.   Osther early game is very strong, with a strong transition into the late game. Their super saiyan MG-42's are dominating, and while hurt in team games because of the heavy tank limit, panthers still do the job nicely.  OKW really, really struggle in 1v1 but are pretty overpowered in 3v3 & 4v4, and are pretty strong in 2v2. Nice heavy late game, strong infantry but struggle mostly against Soviet support weapons.  US came out limping from this patch since they have no potential build diversity in the early game, since all they can really build is Rifleman which suffer greatly from the MG changes. Their armour is paper but their aggression and mobility allows them to still do well in 1v1-2v2.  Infantry is not that potent ATM because of the super saiyan MG's. The MG-42's followed by Maxims being the best of the bunch."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b3oa1,Atrixer,2,Thu Jun 25 19:12:38 2015 UTC,But doesn't the USF mantra stay the same early game? Smoke/ maneuver then nade for the mgs?
CompanyOfHeroes,3b3oa1,Atrixer,5,Thu Jun 25 19:23:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah it does, I always go for early smokes but the range of MG's > Range of smokes. The first burst from an MG-42 suppresses the squad, you can get the smoke off if you're fast, but you're in a compromised position, which gives competent Axis players a chance to capitalize. If you get caught in two-three bursts of the MG you're pinned. It just makes me feel the need to spam even more Rifleman and just float them around the map to flank MG's, rather than tech up. For me, the changes had the opposite effect. This isn't so much of a problem in smaller games but in team games you'll find yourself against walls of MG-42's. Team games have been ruined but 1v1-2v2 games are still fairly competitive."

CompanyOfHeroes,3b1tes,joe1113,13,Thu Jun 25 07:42:43 2015 UTC,I was playing last night and my squads kept getting insta-pinned by MG42's. Their squads could get right up next to my Maxim before it actually suppressed them and when you try to retreat with anything less than a full MG squad they are going to get killed because it seems they stop to have a prayer vigil for any squad member that dies during the retreat.
CompanyOfHeroes,3b1tes,cplcarlman,7,Thu Jun 25 13:55:57 2015 UTC,If the guy carries the gun die they actually have to stop to pick up the gun. In Soviet Russia machine gun is more important than you.

CompanyOfHeroes,3b1tes,edp-f,5,Thu Jun 25 14:18:35 2015 UTC,While I see your point the small fire arc already makes this gun pretty shit. The fact that it can only pin one squad in that arc vs the mg or 50 can suppress 3-5 squads while costing the same. Soviets need a better early anti blob besides quad or kat
CompanyOfHeroes,3b1tes,cplcarlman,3,Thu Jun 25 16:08:40 2015 UTC,Who the hell runs 5 squads into an MG arc of fire DansGame
CompanyOfHeroes,3b1tes,edp-f,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:57:57 2015 UTC,I think the point is that no matter how many squads someone has in the area the MG 42 can suppress all of them.  The same cannot be said for the Maxim.  All someone has to do is bum-rush the Maxim and the squad is dead.  It's the old (but true) argument that the Axis is easier to play because the Allies require more micro.
CompanyOfHeroes,3b1tes,lkysam,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:31:22 2015 UTC,"old (but true) argument that the Axis is easier to play because the Allies require more micro.   Hardly true. We can argue in circles but at the end of the day the person who micros better will win, whether they are axis or allies.  It is also amusing how many tears the new MG42 is causing.  The irony is that Allies and Axis have complaining about blobs, so relic provides counters in the form of stronger MGs, but for some reason only allied fanboys are complaining about it....  This community never ceases to amaze.  USF problems are caused by lack of 0-5 minute diversity, not Axis being OP or requiring less micro.  Having to rely on team weapons with squishy 4 man squads as Ost requires careful positioning, and if you get caught out of position, say goodbye to all of your territory.   Also, I think right now, Soviets require the least amount of micro from any faction.   OKW is just a mess."

That is very interesting.  Damn right I'll complain since apparently USF was supposed to get some early MG counters but Relic held off on that in their infinite wisdom.  So we have super MGs that were supposed to be balanced with counters we didn't get.    Squishy expensive USF MGs that can be rifle naded are worse if you ask me.
CompanyOfHeroes,3b1tes,anon4773,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:35:32 2015 UTC,Early counters like...smoke grenades?
CompanyOfHeroes,3b1tes,Spoonfeedme,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:46:01 2015 UTC,One counter that allows the MG to just reposition whereas Ostheer gets actual rifle grenades to gank US mgs.  Getting them also slows teching so the US player has to spam more rifle squads which everyone at this point agrees is really stupid game design.  They really phoned it in making US spam rifles every game.
CompanyOfHeroes,3b1tes,anon4773,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:22:42 2015 UTC,"Slows down teching to a marginal degree. As for repositioning, MG42s do not reposition well. Do you have more than 1 rifleman? Then bam, easy to take out. Are you blobbing and complaining? Then it's your own fault.  I don't know why you are complaining about USF and riflemen; that is their core unit, just as the Soviet's core is the conscript. And it's probably the best core unit out of all the four countries in terms of versatility. So yes, you'll have 3 or 4 of them. But how you upgrade them and which officer you pair them with makes a much greater difference than any of the other core units."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b1tes,edp-f,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:30:08 2015 UTC,Delaying teching by two minutes is big in the early game.  Ya just accuse me of blobbing based on your delusions.  For every rifle squad there will be an MG.  280mp hard countered by 240mp.  MG42s can support each other which just shits on your theorycraft.  One mg to one riflesquad will win easily.  Your core unit argument is meaningless.    Ostheer gets the most cost efficient upgrade making lmg grens the most cost efficient squad in the game.  USF Rifles can't upgrade to make a greater difference then that no matter what.

CompanyOfHeroes,3b1tes,Katter,0,Sat Jun 27 01:05:02 2015 UTC,They need to buff the maxim somehow or make it not a bumbly piece of shit that can only suppress one squad very well but no more.  Somewhere a Relic employee mentioned that they don't want to turn the maxim into an A-move instant suppression platform which is entirely understandable but I think some buffs are needed or the Maxim needs to become basically an MG42 clone.  Right now it has problems and is back to fumbling retreats that get the weapon decrewed easily.

CompanyOfHeroes,3b2nvq,cplcarlman,4,Thu Jun 25 14:01:41 2015 UTC,"I have found Mechanized to be the most powerful commander. Mark+ T34 ram + Button + IL2 Bomb Strike will eliminate even the super heavy Axis armor.  The nice thing about the limit on heavies is that once you get an ISU out, short of saving for another ISU if you lose the one you have, you can pretty much always have a T34 or two running around supporting it.  Ram, brother. Ram on."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2nvq,velmarg,2,Thu Jun 25 14:19:44 2015 UTC,"Is ramming really worth it? Every single time I try ramming, all it does is disables the enemy tank for a couple seconds, while my T34 suffers from damaged engine and a destroyed gun."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2nvq,HauntedGrass,2,Thu Jun 25 17:11:38 2015 UTC,It is meant to be a last resort. But it means that a tank that would otherwise die can reliably disable the more expensive Axis tank.
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2nvq,Katter,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:35:06 2015 UTC,"Ramming is a ""setting up the pins"" maneuver - you should only ever do it if you have other anti-armor options in place and you're 90% sure that that German tank staying where it is for another 5-6 seconds tops is enough time to destroy with the ZIS or SU85 or AT grenades or whatever else can take advantage.  Ram is a very expensive pin. The chances of you getting your T34/76 out of harm's way after a Ram maneuver are pretty slim, but if you're ramming anything from a Panzer 4 on up, if it means destroying that unit, it's well worth it. A Panzer 4 is 145 fuel, a T34/76 is 100."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2nvq,velmarg,3,Fri Jun 26 03:09:01 2015 UTC,"If you were reliant on doubleing up on IS2s, try commanders with T-34-85's and go T4 for an SU-76 (optional) and SU-85. Your 85 will start to vet nicely. Then when your T-34-85's hit the field they can perss forward while your vetted SU-85 hammers any threating armor."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2nvq,thefonztm,3,Thu Jun 25 14:43:02 2015 UTC,Most top tier players tech before a call-in. It gives them just enough fuel to get an IS2 or t34-85s. The one heavy rule really only affects if you tried to stall for double heavy call-ins. It's better to use your fuel to maintain early vehicle pressure (t70 or katy) while your conscripts are still relevant anyway.

CompanyOfHeroes,3b2nvq,Verax_,3,Thu Jun 25 16:13:45 2015 UTC,The damage reduction means that you need a direct hit to kill. With the 100 damage or so it had before you could land a near miss and still kill squads.

CompanyOfHeroes,3b2nvq,iTzDusty,-1,Thu Jun 25 21:04:11 2015 UTC,Some time ago s1 did an experiment and posted about it here in this subreddit. He let 1 SU and 1 OH mortar fight to the death 20 times. The OH mortar won 18 times. Eventough it has 4 models. The accuracy difference is pretty large imo
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2nvq,November_One,2,Fri Jun 26 00:02:34 2015 UTC,"Those type of tests, just like people who used to put MG 42s against maxims and cons against grens, are irrelevant in an actual match. Sub abilities like flares (which people don't quite understand yet how potent they are) put the Soviet mortar in a offensive role that can not only initiate fights, but sight for itself. The ostheer mortar lacks that capability and is generally used to soften up assaults.   1v1 (unit) testing is a pretty poor metric of effectiveness."

CompanyOfHeroes,3b2r5q,frunmasterx,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:52:50 2015 UTC,"I think so as well. Now that HMGs have been buffed, I think that places OKW in a vulnerable position. OKW has no easy, instant way of pushing units out of buildings, it has no demo charges or flamethrowers. I think something should be done to remedy it, but im unsure as of what. I think maybe allowing a flamethrower sturm upgrade and relinquish minesweeper, or maybe give Volks some demo charges.  I think this is needed because of the time it takes for a IsG to level a building, especially sturdy ones. The time it takes might very well lose you the game."

The DshK however has gotten a lot more stopping power.   Only issue with that video was the mispronunciation of Wehr and Stug."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b1ppb,Chiper136,4,Thu Jun 25 09:35:02 2015 UTC,that's exactly it. Conscripts out front screening for the maxim while it sets up to target the largest enemy concentration.   the only other use I find for it that is solid is for soft retreats because usually the enemy will be pursuing your men in a bee-line so  they walk right into the small ark
CompanyOfHeroes,3b1ppb,F1SH_T4C0,2,Thu Jun 25 10:44:09 2015 UTC,The maxim seems useless compared to the mg42.
CompanyOfHeroes,3b1ppb,joe1113,4,Thu Jun 25 07:46:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its small arc makes it really easy to flank. As a soviet you should probably try to steal an MG42."

CompanyOfHeroes,3b2481,SD_Bolts,17,Thu Jun 25 10:23:03 2015 UTC,You bought the wrong thing. You should have just bought the US multiplayer faction. The ardennes assault is just the campaign. It's not DLC it's a standalone.
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2481,Omega_Warrior,3,Thu Jun 25 10:32:40 2015 UTC,"Basically this.  The base game gives you both the eastern front singleplayer campaign and access to the Wehrmacht and Soviets factions for multiplayer and skirmish.  Ardennes Assault is a standalone singleplayer campaign for the western front. The multiplayer component is sold separately in the Western Front Armies DLC, you can buy both the Oberkommando West and the US Forces separately and allows you to play these factions in multiplayer and skirmish games."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2481,basedyonder,0,Thu Jun 25 13:24:27 2015 UTC,"What the fuck.   Shouldn't it be that Ardennes assult gives acess to ardennes campaign and access to OKW and the US forces? not that you have to buy a campaign for the price of a brand new game, but also buying the teams for multiplayer??"
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2481,Snyggkille,6,Thu Jun 25 17:39:17 2015 UTC,"The factions came out before the campaign and were priced at $12 for 1 and $20 for both, which is a very fair price many of us expected it would be more. The ardennes assault campaign was released later for $40 which is probably a bit overpriced for what you get.  The idea being that to buy the entire WFA experience would cost $60, the price of a normal game."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2481,Omega_Warrior,2,Thu Jun 25 17:59:34 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind Blizzard charges $50-60 for their SC2 expansions, you have to pay in full even if you don't want their campaign, and their multiplayer component of expansions have 2 new units per side and no new factions. Overall the COH2 prices are okay although Ardennes is a little pricey as many have pointed out."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2481,Ironcl4d,9,Fri Jun 26 07:42:32 2015 UTC,"Use Steam Refunds, then  For skirmish get Company of Heroes 2 - The Western Front Armies  imo but better wait for sale.(75% off)"
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2481,BlackDragon_,4,Thu Jun 25 11:59:39 2015 UTC,You shouldn't have bougjt Ardennes Assault. Its a singleplayer campaign.  You got the wrong dlc.
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2481,oddly_shaped_stick,2,Thu Jun 25 10:43:05 2015 UTC,"Try to refund Ardennes and get Western Front Armies, you bought the wrong thing if you want MP/skirmish"
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2481,gokkel,2,Thu Jun 25 13:07:48 2015 UTC,"Like others said, refund Ardennes Assault because it is SP only and get Western Fronts."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2481,BarrierX,0,Thu Jun 25 14:00:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry. You're not the first person who has bought the wrong DLC for this game, there are constantly redditors coming here asking which DLC to get. It is frustrating that they decided to do it this way. They should have just repackaged the games with the Western Front armies, but they are probably making more money this way."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b2481,Katter,6,Thu Jun 25 10:50:33 2015 UTC,It's also a way to let people into the game with minimum investment. Someone can buy OKW/USF for $12 and get into matchmaking with the rest of us straight away. No need to drop $40 on the base game + $20 for an expansion like you traditionally would have to. I think the modular approach is interesting.

It will do with it's mg, not with it's main gun.   2- You can use splash supression to supress units which are behind green cover. For example, if a unit is sitting behind yellow cover near another which is on green cover, shooting at the one behind light cover will make the unit behind green cover supressed.  3-Since vehicles have huge size, shooting at them with MG generate HUGE splash supression. On this way you can supress units around a vehicle almost instantly."

CompanyOfHeroes,3b1mah,daspoulos,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:50:46 2015 UTC,"Accuracy doesn't matter against the squad been fired on, but it matters for spalsh suppression. As vehicle have huge size, they are impossible to miss with MG. Therefore you get huge supression values.   You won't have too many occasions to apply this, but it's good to know."

CompanyOfHeroes,3b1mah,FantasticRabbit,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:28:35 2015 UTC,"Each bullet fired adds suppression to an area, which is modified by distance to target and the cover any single man is in, and then weighed against a suppression meter for that unit. Once the accumulated suppression surpasses a targeted threshold for any single man, the whole squad is suppressed; when more suppression is accumulated, the squad is pinned. Suppression decreases over time and is recovered once the unit stops taking fire.   Check coh2-stats for suppression values for each weapon."
CompanyOfHeroes,3b1mah,tengen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:47:17 2015 UTC,does damage increase suppression?
CompanyOfHeroes,3b1mah,Iswizzie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:01:45 2015 UTC,from what i got from the stats website and what he said no its a separate from damage. I do believe getting suppressed/pinned gives you a slight damage reduction modifier for the first few seconds
CompanyOfHeroes,3b1mah,Iswizzie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:06:46 2015 UTC,then that's why the .50hmg is so garbage
CompanyOfHeroes,3b1mah,Crysack,1 point,Thu Jun 25 07:13:04 2015 UTC,"Last I checked, it has a lower rate of fire (and thus tends to be slower at suppressing). Combine that with its small squad size and yeah, it isn't great."

While it is a nice thing to be able to face MG's, it is now very easy for infantry to quickly assess the direction and radius of an MG (without having to tilt the camera) and skirt it or exploit it by having the MG switch positions so many times that it never gets a chance to fire a burst.   this is the end of the era of 'garrison and forget' map control and I really like it. You actually have to support your garrisoned MG's or be strategic about it.   props relic."

CompanyOfHeroes,3avdec,Tetracyclon,8,Wed Jun 24 19:53:31 2015 UTC,"I find the SU-76 surprisingly effective vs Ostheer T3, but they still require infantry screens for vision and mines on their flanks. Lend-Lease is pretty viable now because three units received buffs from this patch, including the Dshk-38, the Half-track quad upgrade, as well some hidden patch changes that buff the ppsh guard call in, giving them significantly better near range accuracy than conscript ppshs.  The Stuart still seems squishy as ever but the accuracy was noticeably better. It's still not an anti infantry beast like the Luchs, but at least it has some AT utility, including the only allied snare ability that can be used from a vehicle.  HMGs overall suppress reliably now, so that's good. I haven't had someone oorah past my MG42s (yet). I'm a little worried about how effective they are, since we might just have HMG spam instead of blobbing now... But we'll see. At least HMGs can be smoked, flanked, and bombarded with relative ease, and they definitely seem like a potent answer to blobbers now."

While a tier swap is sensible in many respects (I've advocated for it a few times) I'm pleasantly surprised at how well the SU-76 can compliment the SU-85. Getting a SU-76 is a great answer to light vehicles, and a good stop gap if you went T1 and a facing early armor. The health buff is HUGE. Having time to react is amazing.

CompanyOfHeroes,3avdec,Atrixer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:10:44 2015 UTC,"I've found the same. It's certainly more versatile then the AA half/M20, but its in this weird spot where its not better against infantry than the AAHT and its not better against vehicles than medium tanks (plus the AAHT seems to wreck all Axis vehicles from similar tiers anyway). Not sure yet, but I think its only a good option if you've struggled to maintain control of your fuel and you know they'll be bringing out heavier vehicles than the AAHT can deal with."
CompanyOfHeroes,3avdec,1_WHO_1,2,Wed Jun 24 11:59:52 2015 UTC,"I find it pretty useful..it does great damage to infantry, and whereas before it really would die to 2 panzerschreck hits, now it can take maybe 3-4...seems like a small change but it really increases how aggressive you can be with it.

German tanks don't have this problem, since the pintle mounted MG42 can engage infantry regardless of the tank ROE, but it seems the T-34 MGs are bound to the ROE.   Edit: Tanks should be able to fire their MG regardless of the tank ROE. Although I swear the Panther was able to use the pintle mount MG regardless of ROE."
CompanyOfHeroes,3avdec,tgomi,2,Wed Jun 24 14:22:03 2015 UTC,The pintle MG might have been shooting at aircraft. It will do that no matter what I think.

CompanyOfHeroes,3avdec,shitfit_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:28:44 2015 UTC,The only way it will shoot at infantry in vehicle priority is if you specifically target them I think.
CompanyOfHeroes,3avdec,thefonztm,5,Wed Jun 24 00:39:59 2015 UTC,It definitely didn't.
CompanyOfHeroes,3avdec,trineroks,2,Wed Jun 24 00:44:13 2015 UTC,"I am back here to say I most definitely did NOT go insane. /u/thefonztm /u/shitfit_ /u/Bromao /u/GhostReddit /u/tengen /u/rtc3  Youtube proof:  https://youtu.be/4BpAZGh-K-A  Apparently, if you set the ""Prioritize Vehicle"" stance on a tank BEFORE the pintle mount MG42 is completed, the tank gun will not engage, but the pintle MG will engage infantry regardless of ROE."
CompanyOfHeroes,3avdec,Bromao,3,Thu Jun 25 03:11:44 2015 UTC,"It did not fire on infantry with vehicle priority, I can confirm that."
CompanyOfHeroes,3avdec,thefonztm,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:32:41 2015 UTC,"This is akward...  I can confirm that there is a bug with the target priority function, managed to even record it last night. Sometimes you will be in vehicle mode with both the button and above tank indicator showing it as on, but both the main gun and MGs will shoot at infantry. Togglinging back to normal and then back to priority fixes this.  Not sure what triggers it. I've seen it on tanks and AT guns pre and post patch now.   If this occurs to you, save and send the replay to relic.  /u/trineroks, does this match what you describe? /u/tgomi, ever see similar?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3avdec,tgomi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:49:13 2015 UTC,"No, but I have tested this again with the Panther. Most of the time the pintle MG and the main gun won't fire even on vehicle priority stance. However, I have rarely had the MG fire on infantry even when the tank itself was on vehicle priority (icon above tank, button showing it as on).   I'll try to get a recording of this later today."
CompanyOfHeroes,3avdec,thefonztm,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:54:31 2015 UTC,Perhaps you rightclicked on an infantry unit while you had you tanks selected? I've never had this happen to me before.

Best guess is that something causes the unit to 'reset' but the visual indicators don't reset as well. Would be nice if it didn't reset at all. I'm thinking things like vet bonuses that change the way the unit functions or repairing things like critical states."
CompanyOfHeroes,3avdec,marsocks,5,Wed Jun 24 17:09:14 2015 UTC,I thought the Germans didn't engage either. I run the panthers in vehicle priority a lot and I swear they don't do dick with either MG in that mode.
CompanyOfHeroes,3avdec,lixn,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:09:58 2015 UTC,"I just tested this. Nope, the Panther's (and other tanks prior to this patch that had prioritize vehicles) pintle mounted MG42 will engage infantry regardless of tank ROE.  On second thought, I think this is a problem not exclusive to the T-34, but to all the new tanks that got prioritize vehicles in the update - for example, Konigstiger and Panzer IV's pintle mounted MG42s will not fire at infantry if you set the tank to prioritize vehicles.  Edit: nevermind, tested it again and this time even the Panther wouldn't fire its MG on prioritize vehicle mode. I swear it does though..."

The difference between blobbing or not is in the micro, not in the units used.   4 squads of spaced volks pushing a 140 degree attack is not blobbing but those same 4 massed and charging along the same path is. So often a player with poorer micro starts to slip into blobbing as his unit count increases above his ability to manage them. Which the game will punish him for."
CompanyOfHeroes,3av52l,dr-pavel,2,Tue Jun 23 22:31:09 2015 UTC,"If I can significantly turn the tide of battle with a single well-placed mine, det charge, mortar strike, etc.. Then that was a blob.

CompanyOfHeroes,3av52l,meritt_zare,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:56:01 2015 UTC,I think it's interesting that they decided to go with MG's as the blob counter instead of mortars.   MG's are just a superficial blob counter since they can be surpressed and retreated. 120MM Mortars on the other hand often provided a permanent solution.
CompanyOfHeroes,3av52l,F1SH_T4C0,2,Wed Jun 24 08:55:35 2015 UTC,Any group composed of 3 or more squads and moved as a group.  I like to move my troops in groups of 2 usually.
CompanyOfHeroes,3av52l,cplcarlman,3,Tue Jun 23 22:06:02 2015 UTC,Blobbing gets thrown out as an accusation in almost every game.  The word is essentially meaningless and I wouldn't worry about it.

CompanyOfHeroes,3av52l,Malaysia_flight_370,5,Tue Jun 23 19:36:02 2015 UTC,Pretty much anything over two. When people complain about blobbing they usually are talking about big clumps of units that just attack move from point to point on the map.  Most common example is like 3-4 volks with panzerschreks just pushing through everything.
CompanyOfHeroes,3av52l,F1SH_T4C0,0,Tue Jun 23 19:49:31 2015 UTC,That's the only way to vet volsk :/

CompanyOfHeroes,3av52l,Mandarion,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:01:23 2015 UTC,"that may be but they don't need to be clumped together. They can be fanned out in a line, taking cover, flanking, covering fire while another moves in to grenade. Any of these are a good way to vet any infantry"
CompanyOfHeroes,3av52l,HauntedGrass,0,Wed Jun 24 09:33:54 2015 UTC,"Pretty often, having your units stand still first is more important than cover, especially if you can project enough damage output. Having your unit move to cover may even put them at risk of moving through red cover, which combined with the moving penalty can end the engagement to your detriment.    I'm not excusing said behaviour, it's just that cover isn't everything, and if your opponent doesn't have AOE weaponry (like a Scott), the need to actually fan out is non-existent."
CompanyOfHeroes,3av52l,Chukonoku,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:50:14 2015 UTC,I say 4 squads moving all together clumped up without any micro.

CompanyOfHeroes,3av52l,Paz436,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:58:03 2015 UTC,Because it defeats the point of a real time Strategy. If your opponent has a blob that counters anything you do then it loses the need for any skill. A good RTS should have multiple tactics and strategies that constantly change during the battle. CoH is really good for that apart from the ability to blob. It's why you see the devs talk about it alot in balance updates

CompanyOfHeroes,3at0m3,Iswizzie,14,Tue Jun 23 07:21:19 2015 UTC,Unfortunately the engine company of heroes uses can not have separate values for reverse and forwards. So all vehicles go the same speed forwards as they do backwards.
CompanyOfHeroes,3at0m3,Omega_Warrior,9,Tue Jun 23 11:05:17 2015 UTC,"That makes absolutely no sense. Movement values can be altered on triggered events, i.e a bool saying backwards movement is true, if so, set speed to whatever. It's lazy programming, not a fault in the engine. No engine would ever have a limitation like that."
CompanyOfHeroes,3at0m3,Atrixer,5,Tue Jun 23 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"Well this one does. Relic themselves have said so.   It's probably not so much that it is impossible to program, but that messing with that part of the code this late into development would cause so many other problems that it isn't worth it."
CompanyOfHeroes,3at0m3,Omega_Warrior,3,Tue Jun 23 17:49:37 2015 UTC,"Relic saying so doesn't mean it's true. But who am I to think a large company could possibly be lying to cover their tracks?  If this is the case then it's simply TERRIBLE programming. No code should be so inaccessible that you cannot change basic vectors. You learn this shit in year 1 of computer science. If they have a reverse function built in game for micro, and tanks can move backwards, there is simply no way you cannot change this value. They have shown movement speed can be changed by the fact smokes slow down tanks, they have acceleration speeds, and engine damage."
CompanyOfHeroes,3at0m3,Atrixer,3,Tue Jun 23 20:42:49 2015 UTC,I assume its not that the changing the speed is the main issue but it might have something to do with pathfinding.  Also all changes to unit speed are affecting the whole unit (model) so it really might have something to do the way units are projected on the map. A simple boolean isn't quite that simple as units can reverse even without a specific command so how do you determine what direction is backwards. Its even worse if unit are dots on navigation matrix.  In addition to all of that it would be yet an  another thing to balance.  So it can be lazy/bad coding but it might not be as simple as it seems

I can imagine that slower reversing would make this an absolute nightmare.  I think a more viable solution would be a bool (like you say) but slightly tweaked   if backwards movement = true, then max speed = 1/2 max forward speed"

CompanyOfHeroes,3at0m3,HauntedGrass,2,Tue Jun 23 10:40:06 2015 UTC,Blitz has been knocked down pretty hard for Panthers and Tigers. Not nearly as fast as their medium tanks.
CompanyOfHeroes,3at0m3,TrystonG33K,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:12:02 2015 UTC,"The classic OST move is to push a panther into a defended position to see what kind of AT you have. If it's enough to counter/destroy the panther, then either a) if you're vet 1, you switch on ""blitzkrieg"" and disappear backwards at warp speed, or b) if your doctrine has it, you hit the smoke launchers, which prevents it from being targeted long enough to back up, or c) both. If the panther doesn't find any AT threats, then you can use vision to call down artillery, send in the skillblob, send in other armor, whatever you want. As others point out, you can lay down mines in their avenues of attack; if they push in far enough you can also drive a lower value tank directly behind it to stop it from backing up.  When I find someone who's doing this, I try to resist the temptation to chase the panther. Instead, I let it go and wait for him to come back (which they usually do). I hide whatever AT I've got out of range/sight and put in some MGs/conscripts/whatever. Then, when the panther rolls up, doesn't see any other tanks, and the other player sends in a blob, I try to engage them with good anti-infantry tools and flank around behind the panther. If it's in the middle of a real attack, you can usually force the other guy into bad decisions."

They overextend to lure you in thinking you can go in for the kill; this makes you overextend your tanks which get fausted or shreked to death. Unless you are Soviet and punish Panthers with mines, it's hard for the USF unless you back tech to M20. Then you get free pickup."
CompanyOfHeroes,3at0m3,Charismaztex,0,Tue Jun 23 16:00:41 2015 UTC,For the same reason a 152 is faster than a king tiger going backwards.

CompanyOfHeroes,3at0m3,SurSpence,-4,Thu Jun 25 00:30:52 2015 UTC,Allied tanks generally have a lot better range than axis tanks luke jacksons and su85s but are slower than their axis counterparts because of blitzkrieg ability. The best thing I could recommend is instead of just having easy 8s diversify your armor a bit more with a Jackson or 2 it can greatly out range the Panther and can keep up with it as well
CompanyOfHeroes,3at0m3,Cpt_seal_clubber,-7,Tue Jun 23 08:50:17 2015 UTC,"Probably because axis only wins about 40% of their games in 2v2, less in 1v1. Now that axis can only have 1 heavy on the field at a time, you won't even have to worry about it. Spam jacksons if you're USF or spam t34s if ur soviets until you get the is2"

CompanyOfHeroes,3aw6q0,iTzDusty,7,Wed Jun 24 02:01:47 2015 UTC,"Something about this game makes you always feel like the other faction is op when you lose. I think it's because it's hard to figure out where you went wrong. Thus if you can't figure out where you went wrong, our primitive brains jump to the conclusion that ""It must be the other factions fault! Fuck that faction or I would have won!"" (As an aside, anyone else think also that it's funny relic censor in game chat, yet the German MG team says ""Get this fucking MG team out of here in game""?)  In other games that I play with a competitive mindset it's always easy to point out where I went wrong. Thinking back on games of csgo it's ""If my aim was better here I would have won that round or if I had flashed there I might have won that engagement."" It's easy to realise how to improve, and you can't blame anyone but yourself. But in this game I've found it so hard to self access for some reason, and in this game it's far far easier to just blame someone else because it's hard to know where you went wrong. Which is why I think people tend to blame the other faction rather than themselves. I'd like to think that I'm quite a rational human and one who is quick to blame myself if something goes wrong, rather than others but I've found myself playing a game as axis, losing and thinking ""Jesus that tactic the allies used is op as fuck"" than playing allies, losing and thinking the exact same about the axis! And then I realise I'm being retarded and upon further reflection I can find out where I lost, but it's never that obvious. Than if you combine the difficulty of self accessing how the game went with literally a community more childish than /r/dayz, you end up with what you say above. COH2.org is actually a cesspool, this place isn't so bad. But people like queenratchet on COH2.org are some of the most ignorant obstinant people I've ever seen online in a forum."

It makes no sense having such a late game unit in a ""rush for armor and either win in 15 minutes or lose the game completely"" commander.  Anyways, I'd say it's pretty hard to balance Soviet Industry anyways, it's a very unique commander and even small changes have the potential of making it completely broken, like when it was released alongside Elite Troops."

You have some footage skiping to another that it disrupts the flow of the video, such as at 30 and 42 seconds for example.  Ill give you this, the first 10 seconds are the best so far in terms of presentation. some of the various bits of live game playfootage is also good.

CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,Tetracyclon,5,Mon Jun 22 19:16:59 2015 UTC,Balance is more important than real life.  The Sturm Tiger is basically a free squad wipe every shot when used correctly.  It shouldn't be able to do that more than it already does.
CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,anon4773,14,Mon Jun 22 15:56:19 2015 UTC,"The sturmtiger is trash for its cost/efficiency ratio, literally only being produced in roflstomps. For 60 less fuel you can get the Stukka which is infinitely more effective at getting wipes. The Sturmtiger can cause mass retreats and possibly take out heavy support weapons like Zis, but again, the Stukka can do this for less cost without putting itself into the line of fire."
CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,5,Mon Jun 22 17:08:51 2015 UTC,"yep, i only use the sturmtiger for base sieges."
CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,bmwatson132,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:23:51 2015 UTC,SturmTiger can cause mass retreats without even firing.  Can also do good damage against armor.  I lost 2 kv1s to one being an idiot once.  It is gimmicky.  But it walks a fine line between gimmicky and OP.
CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,5,Mon Jun 22 18:37:49 2015 UTC,"It's just not practical. In scenarios it seems like an efficient vehicle, but when it comes to an army's build in actual match progression, it just can't fill the hole that other units of similar cost can. I've seen it take out 2 T34/85s, but at the same time, I've seen it fail to kill a T34/76 in a direct hit. Also it's very easy to micro away from as it has short range and slow firing speed.   Mass retreats are nice, and the ability to cancel firing makes it great at feigning, but in the end of it all, you want wipes, not retreats, which the stukka is better at getting in almost every way for a fraction of the cost. It even causes mass retreats almost as much as a sturmtiger does. The tank may send an army fleeing back to base, but a skilled player will return with a strategy to take it out. As for the stukka, you can fire freely from behind the safety of your lines without worrying about your vehicle having to hobble out of battle and risk getting snared."
CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,anon4773,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:36:33 2015 UTC,"Yea, it is the definition of a hit or miss unit, I would be ok with two shots before reload, maybe a short interlude of like 10 seconds so you couldn't do them back to back, but still, I would be fine with this"
CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,2,Mon Jun 22 21:21:35 2015 UTC,"I would say it needs a range buff more than anything. It's too slow and  its armor is subpar compared to what it should be. It should also give off a loud and unique engine noise similar to the King Tiger, so players have a chance to hear it approach them so its increased range doesn't end up sniping people unexpected."
CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,anon4773,-1,Mon Jun 22 21:27:16 2015 UTC,"It is gimmicky.  There are a lot of gimmicky units in this game, that doesn't mean they are in a situation where they can be buffed or should be.    Competitive players are already sick of this game being squad wipe city on the corner of bullshit and nonsense.  Making a tank that is capable of one shotting multiple tanks even better is a step in the wrong direction.    You can't buff a unit because a skilled player can take it out.  That is true of every unit in this game, at least I hope so."
CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,3,Mon Jun 22 20:52:04 2015 UTC,"There was actually a really good alternative I read somewhere before alpha was announced that the Sturmtiger would become a Doctrinal unit for Elite Armor, replacing the useless Panzer IV call in. It would receive major buffs to penetration (and damage and firing range if I recall correctly), but would also become classified as a super heavy (which it technically is) and would cost as much as one. I think this would be a neat alternative solution that would make the Sturmtiger and the Elite Armor doctrine playable."

CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,anon4773,2,Mon Jun 22 21:03:53 2015 UTC,"It is unfortunately very bad, which I find disappointing as it's one of the few commanders with extremely coordinating abilities like the doctrines from the original game. The Panzer IV ausf J call in seems great for the price, but they usually show up around the same time as an IS-2 or T34-85s and just can't compete. You'd think the HEAT shell ability would help, but most people agree that the penn boost is unnoticeable in game.   The panzer commander is cool on a King Tiger, as it can call in light artillery to wipe out any nearby Zis or weapons teams. Before the nerf, the King Tiger with a commander could spearhead major attacks with devastating effects. Not so much anymore though."

But hey, this is /r/Companyofmorons, so calling another commenter ""wehraboo"" without even being able to define the word (otherwise you wouldn't have used it in this context) will give instant upvotes. I mean, you tried to use your own mistake (as you yourself admitted, and I wasn't trying to insult you, just showing what the problem was) as a reason for why the balance is okay.   Hell, I didn't even disagree with you on terms of the Sturmtiger, I never said anything that would make me a wehraboo in any possible meaning of the word, but because you don't even know what the word means, you use it as an insult. People like you are exactly the problem this community has. People like you are exactly why we can't have an adult discussion about the real balance problems in this game.

CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,anon4773,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:32:31 2015 UTC,"No, you didn't. I just hoped it would bring some sense into someone here, but I guess that hope is (just as always) wasted effort.  It's like the son of my brother. Even you catch him on the spot doing some shit, he will still deny it. ""Nu uh! I wasn't eating the chocolate! I don't care that I still have chocolate sticking to my fingers, it wasn't me!"""
CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,thefonztm,2,Mon Jun 22 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"And just what is correctly? Unless I'm firing through a shot blocker, which is totally dependent on the map and more importantly where the enemy is, most people wisely panic retreat or at least move any unit that's sorta in front of the sturmtiger. Many of my engagements I don't even end up firing the damn rocket due to it's wind up. It becomes a series of bluffs.  Not saying 2 shots is a solution, especially with the veterancy rate buff, but just what is 'properly'?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,anon4773,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:21:51 2015 UTC,Implying causing frequent retreats isn't extremely useful.  Also stopping tank charges since the shots do good damage against armor.   Firing at people as they round corners.  exploiting true sight and whatnot.
CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,thefonztm,2,Mon Jun 22 19:34:50 2015 UTC,"Imo, if you need to retreat 3- 4 squads, you blobed, not my problem.   Really, if you see it coming there's almost no reason to retreat, infantry are plenty quick. It's when you notice the sturm as it begins to fire that you must panic and retreat.  As for tru sight, that's what I meant by shot blocker."
CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,thefonztm,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:05:56 2015 UTC,Forcing one full health squad to retreat is a big deal.  Any more and things are just swell.  If someone retreats squads when they see that windup then you just ruised them.  You can wind up again very quickly.  If they don't retreat then actually fire the rocket and get a squad wipe or gimp some squads enough to give your infantry the advantage.  You can easily trigger the wind up enough to scare off 3-4 spaced out squads in an engagement or actually fire and hit something.   I can't think of a 1v1 map without shot blockers or opportunities for tomfoolery.  Steppes is the only map I can think of where using the Sturm would be an issue.
CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,relkin43,3,Mon Jun 22 21:22:59 2015 UTC,"It's a 'win engagement' button if you blob 3 squads for me or fail to move your tank during the wind up. Anything that stays moving is a royal bitch to hit. Never cross in front if you see the barrel rising, I'm trying to lead you. If you split in two directions, I simply must back off.  That said, I'd toy around with the idea of double range for half accuracy or something. As a support weapon, it's a bit annoying that I need to close inside enemy vision to fire... but If I didn't I think the sturm would be too good at wiping stuff using any cheap infantry to scout."
CompanyOfHeroes,3apzpl,rshunter313,2,Mon Jun 22 16:28:48 2015 UTC,"I'd give that a shot, though I don't think an auto-fire ability is a good fit.  One tip, you can often save your squads by not panic retreating. Instead close in or move opposite your probable retreat path. I, and I bet most sturm tiger users do lead infantry a bit expecting a retreat.  Really, I'd like CoH2 to have a 'scatter' button that spreads out squad members/squads. This would be a great way to keep infy from bunching up on tiny cover and prevent wipes from AoE weapons. Damn cover is super sticky and sometimes I really don't want to stick to it."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aozng,Scowen,13,Mon Jun 22 09:20:38 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, if you're at that point in a 2v2, you've already won and are just toying with your prey. I have seen a few annoyances with this on a 4v4 though, where two of the four teammates just start ""farming"" armor for the other two teammates and keep their infantry count high instead. But, are 4v4's really competitive anyway?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3aozng,Deftonez,5,Mon Jun 22 12:35:37 2015 UTC,This. I'm willing to wager there were mistakes made if there are 15 Shermans on field.
CompanyOfHeroes,3aozng,MolotovFromHell,3,Mon Jun 22 17:43:01 2015 UTC,"Yes this is a thing, but relic has pretty much stated that it is intentional. In that any solution to it only causes worse problems and they rather have vehicle crews then remove then to fix the issue. It also doesn't come up much in actual competitive play so it isn't that big of an issue."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aozng,Omega_Warrior,3,Mon Jun 22 09:29:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you had the time and resources to wait for 15 Sherman's, you were probably going to win anyway."

CompanyOfHeroes,3am3jg,Best-Pony,4,Sun Jun 21 15:50:31 2015 UTC,"Depends on the weapon profile in question.  If my memory serves bolt action squads get a 50% accuracy penalty for moving. This includes grens, cons, rifles, volks, paras etc. so it's almost always best to keep these guys in green or yellow cover unless you have a numeric advantage in which case you can close the gap.  Guys with SMGs like Thompson paras and ppshs I think retain 75% of their accuracy while moving but more important their accuracy past 12ish meters is awful so you always want to close in with them, although always avoid red cover if you can - smoke nades on shocks help with this. Red cover is always bad bad bad news for your infantry.   Pgrens are a weird mix. They're more accurate on the move than grens but still usually best to keep them in cover since their dps is always solid and they're expensive. They're pretty lethal for chasing and wiping squads though but you have to be so careful with them. It's easy to misuse them and bleed yourself."
CompanyOfHeroes,3am3jg,CieZ23,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:00:45 2015 UTC,A 50% accuracy penalty is significant and something that can win or lose battles.  Where is the source of this information?

CompanyOfHeroes,3am3jg,Chukonoku,2,Fri Jun 26 16:13:37 2015 UTC,"I'll add: in terms of receive damage/accuracy, red cover is as bad as no cover. Red cover has worst modificators against supression."
CompanyOfHeroes,3am3jg,troglodyte,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:16:56 2015 UTC,"General rules (the percentage is the percent of normal accuracy):   50% for bolts, non sniper. 75% for sub machine guns and some assault rifles. 25% for LMGs (when capable of fire on the move). This means that while Obers and Paras can fire on the move with their LMG upgrades, they're terrible at it and should be kept in fixed positions for max DPS.   Unfortunately, CoH2 has too many weapons and many are exceptions. Semi automatic rifles vary; the Garand, for example, is good for 60%. Heavier assault weapons like the BAR often sit between bolts and SMGs. Check the ""Moving"" section of CoH2Stats for exact values."

CompanyOfHeroes,3am3jg,Mandarion,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:42:19 2015 UTC,"Not exactly, the difference between RA and armour is, that armour applies when a model is hit. IIRC Shocks have 1.5 armour, which basically reduces all damage received by 50%.   The bigger problem with Assault Grens on top of all the others is, that they don't get smoke. Every other storm infantry gets smoke grenades in this game, except for the Ostheer which doesn't get any smoke at all (aside from mortars). This in turn makes any buff to any non-Axis MG instantly OP, because the Ostheer is missing the most basic counter to MGs. It's an incredible design flaw/oversight...."

Also, I think that shock troopers are the only SMG troops that do get smoke. Paratroopers and upgraded cons don't get it, pioneers sure as heck don't get it.

Also, though this might be an old change, Pioneers have increased line of sight to spot for the MG42s.  Gren, MG42, Gren, Sniper, Gren, Mortar is a pretty solid build order, in my experience."

Tiger ace wont rly save you so going mechanized is always a good idea, ass grens and rek penals. Be careful with your mg's, they got a buff last patch and if pared together can hold back the enemy quite well. Demos on the other hand should mean that he has a lot of floating munitions or you are 'Blobing' so to say. The normal mines often times have a common placement you can kinda start guessing where he will place them. Other than that all I can say is just dont over extend yourself.

CompanyOfHeroes,3am17l,Vystas,8,Sun Jun 21 17:20:03 2015 UTC,"correct Assault Grenadiers are trash. Elite troop doctrine can be good since you can get out a panther and a Tigerace at once. Those two, supported by infantry can give your enemy some headache. Especially if you catch one of his tanks out of position. If you use target weakpoint of the tigerace and stun his vehicle its pretty much dead. However if your enemy knows you are playing elite troops he will most likely plant mines. always sweep for mines and before calling in the Tigerace make sure you have a good core of infantry. Repeat after me: an unsupported tigerace is a dead tigerace"
CompanyOfHeroes,3am17l,shitfit_,3,Sun Jun 21 17:57:52 2015 UTC,I find it highly unlikely that you'll be calling in a Panther and a Tiger Ace at the same time in a 1v1...

CompanyOfHeroes,3am17l,Mandarion,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:18:36 2015 UTC,"DPS wise? No, the MG42 especially at long range it better. But the G43 provides you with higher mobility (can be fired on the move), is cheaper (more units equipped), gives access to interrogation, and actually has the highest damage per shot out of any rifle in the game (except for the PTRS)..."
CompanyOfHeroes,3am17l,nichts_neues,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:00:25 2015 UTC,"I think you should, as Ostheer, try to seize a more compact area instead of spreading out too much. I recommend at least 3 grenadiers and keep your pios near. I find that their close range DPS, however minimal, is a nice way to wear down and distract early cons and riflemen while your grens focus fire on them. I don't ever let my grens fight individually; they need to support one another and provide a screen for your mg42  Additionally, mortars can be extremely helpful. It just takes 1 good direct hit to turn the balance in fight where rifles or cons are engaging your grens from cover, since it's rarely a good idea to close the distance with grens. Keep in mind, the Ostheer potency comes from close knit combined arms, where your grens (screen, DPS dealer) MG42 (suppression source) and mortars (DPS, cover denial) need to work as one unit. HTs and bunkers are a good idea too, because you might fight with this combined arms core in a vital area. Use your pios and left over units to cap in such a way that you don't weaken said core.   When all these elements - grens, mgs, mortars, eventually paks - are working together, you can lock down areas very effectively. Use pgrens and armor as your mobile flanking element. And always lay mines. With the prevalence of early and powerful USF light vehicles, a few well placed tellers are never a bad way to spend munitions."

CompanyOfHeroes,3ajyt2,nicksam112,5,Sat Jun 20 23:00:34 2015 UTC,"Focus infantry until you can get out something heavier than a puma, Guards aren't all that great with heavy armor and if he's got T1 he won't have ZiS guns. MG's are great for crowd control, Obers/sturms/falls can all wreck Guards pretty easily as those DP's and PTRS's are only useful long/med range. Don't put any trucks anywhere near the front line or the 120mm/penals will wreck it.   I'd go med truck vs that to get the field gun and jagdpanzer, great to manage blobs and to knock out those t-34/85's when they come out. If you really wanna use a Luchs or puma you gotta micro it well and just keep kiting his units."
CompanyOfHeroes,3ajyt2,TurtleMaster99,2,Sat Jun 20 23:20:35 2015 UTC,"Fallschirmjäger pops in houses behind entrenched* units are devastating if you're playing a static opponent. Remember Obers with Mg34's are your friends. And tear up guards as they close the distance. If you're having trouble at range, Panzerfusiliers with G43's are devastating at distance is you're in more of a stand off, but guards are weak against automatic fire up close; they are much harder to deal with after closing the distance.   If you see Guards, avoid scrim vehicles (Luchs, flak trak etc) and combine arms with Raketenwufers and Shrecks to deal with light vehicles that try to kite you. Also, remember suppression with the Flak track can be great, but it's much more effective when you see Shocks pop.   In short, the best way to combat the guards if to go heavy base infantry and then wait it out. You have to feel around 6/7 minutes in after the first couple of CP's have stacked as to what direction you want to lean. Being flexible and countering your opponent (while avoiding getting locked into a doctrine your opponent has countered) will lead to success. OKW is based around the stall game. They can be hyper aggressive, but it's often folly if your mad scramble is countered early enough. It can set you way back, and now you're playing defensively versus playing a move ahead of your opponent."
CompanyOfHeroes,3ajyt2,TurtleMaster99,2,Sat Jun 20 23:26:33 2015 UTC,"I like fallschirms but they hardley have any armor. They are wrecking machines (especially with the neutral building ability) but they just are so easy to kill. Like maybe just a tad bit more armor would make them much more effective. Not like shock armor but just more. They cost the same but 1 cant take the other out so easily whereas fallschrims need distance and some cover to kill them before they close in.   Fusiliers are nice but I hate 2 things about them: 1 90 munis for G43? what the hell thats a rip off. Ostheer needs half that. 2. You have to commit to a commander that doesn't have that great of abilities aside from this and the officer (arty strike costs a ton).  I can't really play a defensive game as well if I have a 120mm mortar attacking my schwer and I want it as a semi offensive weapon, not up by a VP but in one of the first sector areas.  Any ideas to my arguments?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3ajyt2,TrystonG33K,3,Sat Jun 20 23:44:22 2015 UTC,"90 munis actually is somewhat fair to me. You can't compare the two, because Elite Troops offers you a tank that absolutely wipes your resource income. Upgrading to G43's is important for ET because losing any squad once you have the Tiger Ace out is devastating to come back from. You simply have to have max damage per model to effectively make a push and sustain it when it's really hard to reinforce. Not having that resource bleed with Fusiliers makes a double cost somewhat understandable when you consider how base infantry can be equipped with the best hand held AT in the game, get to Vet 5, and while weak early, become just about insufferable at highest Vet levels. It makes the choice hard for OKW, choosing between infantry and vehicle weapon additions. It can't be a free ride with both or else it would be pretty OP.   Consider that Paratroopers cost 120munis for LMG's/90 for Thompsons and BAR's cost you manpower bleed, oil, AND munitions. Every upgrade has their drawbacks and benefits."
CompanyOfHeroes,3ajyt2,TurtleMaster99,3,Sun Jun 21 00:03:15 2015 UTC,Y'know that Elite Troops isn't the only Wehr doctrine with G43's right? Lightning War is one of my favorite doctrines and Jaeger Infantry gets them too.

OKW cant build caches so its difficult to commit to munis or fuel with them where Allies typically are just flowing in it at a minimum of 29-50 (depending on if they are losing or winning).  OKW its more like 29 if you have half the map I feel like.

CompanyOfHeroes,3ai481,Licentiosus,2,Sat Jun 20 11:51:18 2015 UTC,"Well #1 your gonna want scavenge (ostwind pwns infantry) and fortifications doctrine (get to build bunkers, get an mg, and a pack. These commanders never go cheaper than the 2 bucks so you might as well get them on steam now.  Yes commanders basically are a replacement for the doctrines.  DLC commanders have units and abilities that vary. In all honesty if you play 1v1 or 2v2, your gonna lose hardcore if you play against allies that know what they are doing.   A tip as OKW vs soviets in 1v1. When you create the T2 vehicle building, if its around the 15 minute mark, just get a puma out. Don't get a half track. The puma is already there and ready to combat a t34 (just make sure you have a raketenwerfer or a volks with a panzerschrek with it. This way the soviet player cant wreck you until you get a panther out.   Mainly keep those two together as your medium AT armor squad.  If they got heavy tanks, hope you have a panther out or its gg.  Also, don't feel compelled to keep your schwer panzer HQ as close to the battle as possible. Sometimes its just smarter to keep it near your base if they have an advantage. I usually put it near a VP with a shot blocker protecting it so a SU85 cant snipe it.  You'll learn as you win and inevitably lose. Who to avoid, when you should just retreat, what is the appropriate level of micro.  I'd recommend playing against bots first just to get used to it."
CompanyOfHeroes,3ai481,ConeIcon,0,Sat Jun 20 15:00:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks, just one more question, if I don't buy any doc commanders will I be at a noticeable disadvantage?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3ai481,Olekman,0,Sun Jun 21 00:27:51 2015 UTC,"Not really. Its just very nice to have because you aren't relying on their not so good commanders compared to the allies.  Fallschrims and mgs are good (mg gets a damage decrease but suppression boost in next patch).  Panzerfusillers are decent as well only if you got g43s with them. If you got two squads with them, they dominate infantry. Think of them as Volksgrenediers only with a 6 man squad and deadly accurate semi automatic rifles."
CompanyOfHeroes,3ai481,ConeIcon,-2,Sun Jun 21 00:55:19 2015 UTC,"Read the FAQ and the Buy Guide, its in the sidebar ffs. You can also try searching if your questions have been asked before (they have)."

CompanyOfHeroes,3af651,metamorphosis,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:48:58 2015 UTC,That tune has been stuck in my head for months and now I find out it's from a Russian song about the Maxim Gun.
CompanyOfHeroes,3af651,SrpskaZemlja,2,Sat Jun 20 01:13:10 2015 UTC,"Because I love crazy WW2 stories, how about another   March 26, 1944 light tank T -70, noting the two approaching German tank PzKpfw V “Panther”, disguised in a bush and took them on sight. After the “Panther” closer to 150-200 meters and framed in jeopardy board, T -70 suddenly opened fire from ambush and dуыекщнув “Panther” faster than those able to detect it. Crews get out of the “Panthers” could not. T-70 commander Lieutenant A. Pegov was promoted to the rank of Hero of the Soviet Union.   (Excuse what I assume is a rough translation)  Thanks to the Panthers ridiculously thin side and rear armor (40mm iirc?), it could be penetrated easily a tank such as the tiny T-70. However like all fun stories from the Soviet Union, it's best taken with a grain of salt."
CompanyOfHeroes,3af651,24CharacterLimit,4,Fri Jun 19 17:07:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the grain of salt bit haha. There are quite a few claims on destroying ""Panthers"" from both allied forces on the Eastern and Western fronts that have very little substantial evidence to them. My understanding is that many tank crews just claimed every German tank to be a Panther."
CompanyOfHeroes,3af651,relkin43,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:33:37 2015 UTC,Also lots straight up lied (across all factions) about their accomplishments (it was in fact encouraged) which was then used for propaganda purposes.  I'm very skeptical of a T-70 taking out two panthers due to penn tables.

CompanyOfHeroes,3afjb7,trineroks,5,Fri Jun 19 18:44:30 2015 UTC,"Fun Fact (which a lot of people probably caught on to):  If your pop cap is at say 98 as USF, you can get out of your tanks and it lowers your pop cap and then you can get more units out, then hop right back into them!  If I have an advantage atm I do this all the time!"
CompanyOfHeroes,3afjb7,nickbass95,3,Fri Jun 19 20:22:20 2015 UTC,"I'm quite aware of this fact as well, but that doesn't apply to Wehr/Sov/OKW. Also, it's not the equivalent of totally getting rid of a unit to make space for a new one.   How am I to get rid of a rifle squad for an AT crew, for example? I have to suicide my rifles. Why can't there be an ability to just recall the rifle squad out of the battlefield and get that pop back?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3afjb7,SilverCurve,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:09:49 2015 UTC,The drawback to this is that you have to pop all your crews out if you want to reinforce.  This is best to do right before a big push rather than abuse throughout the game.
CompanyOfHeroes,3afjb7,velmarg,12,Sat Jun 20 04:11:43 2015 UTC,You can order units to attack ground to kill other friendly units. That way they don't feed experience to enemies.
CompanyOfHeroes,3afjb7,HauntedGrass,-1,Fri Jun 19 23:28:03 2015 UTC,Not sure who downvoted you or why - you're right.  Fuck them.

CompanyOfHeroes,3afjb7,cradledcat,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:55:23 2015 UTC,Well with cons you can just merge squads together instead of reinforcing. Make sure you select the squad with less veterancy and have it merge into the squad with more.
CompanyOfHeroes,3afjb7,Shadowx93ca,2,Fri Jun 19 19:15:09 2015 UTC,"I think it theres strategy to managing popcop. Theoretically you could churn out conscripts and reach popcap in several minutes. Someone do the math. But the point is that you're supposed to hold your popcap for your desired army composition. I don't really belive in ""last minute 98 popcap at guns"" Then agaim, I'm a believer that you gotta build two AT guns every game. Pretty early. Maybe a third.   Garden tanks."
CompanyOfHeroes,3afjb7,SanDiegoBurrito,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:17:52 2015 UTC,"Right now you have to run your units into the enemy and kill them off.

CompanyOfHeroes,3aexxp,iTzDusty,4,Fri Jun 19 16:08:26 2015 UTC,"They do additional damage vs infantry but keep in mind the reload time, it's not something to be hitting if there's a blob approaching"
CompanyOfHeroes,3aexxp,nicksam112,2,Fri Jun 19 17:00:09 2015 UTC,The drawback is it takes longer to reload?
CompanyOfHeroes,3aexxp,nicksam112,7,Fri Jun 19 17:05:06 2015 UTC,"What I meant by that is that when you hit the ""AP round"" ability the MG will stop firing and take about 5 seconds to reload the gun before it starts firing again except now with the AP/Incendiary rounds.   That's why it's more useful vs light vehicles since against blobs it might give them enough time to rush up and throw a nade before you start firing again."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aexxp,mrIronHat,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:10:43 2015 UTC,suppress the infantry and then use the ability. the extra DPS is excellent for killing suppressed infantry.
CompanyOfHeroes,3aexxp,Chukonoku,4,Fri Jun 19 22:05:45 2015 UTC,"MG34/42 IR: they melt infantry. They have double damage than normal rounds, therefore doubling DPS.  Only issue is hitting terrain.   Dshk: ATM theres no point to use AP rounds as they just increase penetration which don't have any effect on Axis infantry."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aexxp,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:14:21 2015 UTC,"Oh yes they do. Incendiary AP tears infantry a new one. Highly recommended. Just remember they need to reload before firing, so don't try to turn it on if they're already Urrah-ing around you."

CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,movingon11,11,Sun Jun 21 09:29:14 2015 UTC,"With the way allies are set up they require a lot more micro but have ""better"" survivability due to their large unit size. The issue is that Axis units have been built to be better with less so as a result they require less micro in 2v2s-4v4s. This leads to things like gren blobs that are almost unstoppable by ally units as Axis units gain better scaling vet and overall better armor and AT options.  It leads to a very frustrating game and a cause for ""ally spam"" as they simply have only a handful of options to help them stay in the game."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,rshunter313,13,Fri Jun 19 15:13:23 2015 UTC,You find gren blobs unstoppable? That's... incredible.

I can only manage it when I'm having a good day at CoH or am cracked out on adderall.   Granted the soviets require more micro when you go clown cars and T34/76s, but the same could be said with OKW going Puma and Luchs. Still, they both have heavier options unlike the USF."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:48:21 2015 UTC,"Really? because axis have a much higher loss rate than allies across the board, except in 4v4.

When I play axis (who i have much more experience on) i lose way more. i liked axis a lot more but I just have to play allies now."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,Masterfuzzfuzz,-8,Tue Jun 23 21:59:21 2015 UTC,The nazi fan boy stuff comes from the forms when axis heavy players refuse to look at the stats of units and realize there are HUGE balance issues. The community eats itself alive while they wait for patches to adjust broken units leading to a toxic community.
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,rshunter313,0,Fri Jun 19 15:14:51 2015 UTC,Hasn't it been proven with stats that Allies win more games in general now? Isn't it like 60/40 their way?
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,eLeArterial,4,Fri Jun 19 22:35:37 2015 UTC,"The allies tend to do marginally better in 1v1s, though I don't think it was as drastic as 60/40.  2v2s are relatively balanced - I believe the latest stats, however, showed that at the top 100, Axis mixed pair still tended to outperform Allied pairings.  In 3s and 4s the Allied armies statistically underperform drastically, particularly in games that last longer than 10 minutes.

CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,Handy_Banana,3,Sat Jun 20 02:25:13 2015 UTC,Here's the thing - you can get better.  They're not going to balance the game on the presumption of GoodPlayersTM starting to play less well.
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,DasArsenal,0,Sat Jun 20 00:57:34 2015 UTC,"Ok but why balance the games around what's fun for the top 1%? I play COH with a beer to relax before bed, I'm not going to put in the time to practice a video game.   Anyway this strategy doesn't seem to be working out as COH2 continues to wither into obscurity. I'm sure the whole Esports thing will start bringing in the sales any day now."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,lkysam,5,Sat Jun 20 02:34:26 2015 UTC,"So what do you want, a skill handicap until you're beating people who outplay you?  If you play a game to win - and let's face it, beer or not you wouldn't care if you didn't think you deserved to win for outplaying your opponent - the most you can reasonably ask for is a fair chance.  A game that's balanced for the top is a game that's balanced, fairness is not an output of skill."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,DasArsenal,0,Sat Jun 20 02:46:34 2015 UTC,"Right now they seem to have it balanced that, if you are really really good, the allies are a bit better than the axis in 1v1. This is because the allies in general have weaker units and have to use stuff like mines and smoke grenades and constant probing attacks to even the odds. If you are just average, the axis are much easier to win with because they just need to hold on for heavy tanks and roll over the allies. This is especially true in team games which make up the vast majority of games played.  I guess I just don't see the point in balancing the game to make it the most fun for smallest group of players (people who are very good) playing the least common game mode (1v1).  It seems like Relic would get the most money by making the game fun for the largest amount of people.   It's not a matter of winning. I switch off between axis and allies so any imbalance benefits me as much as it hurts me in terms of winning. And I don't really care about winning. I want close, exciting games team games (because I mostly play with my IRL friends). Relic can either balance the game for casual people playing team games (the vast majority of their player base) or people who play 1v1 16 hours a day. They chose the latter and the game (and sales) have suffered for it."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,lkysam,9,Sat Jun 20 04:13:56 2015 UTC,"4v4 is the most played game mode and it is entirely axis favored. That is why people whine. Relic tries to balance the game for 1v1 when only a few people actually play it. I presume most people who whine at axis only play team games.  Imo they should have balanced this game with team games in mind instead of 1v1 considering how few people actually play 1v1.  ""Edit"" Not sure why im being downvoted. Just saying why people hate on Axis (which i am not as i play mostly 1v1) and you can't argue that Axis isn't better in 4v4. And it's easy to see what game mode is played the most by simple graphs."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,Vharii,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:44:38 2015 UTC,That's weird because i see streamers and the viewing lobby are almost exclusively 2v2s or 1v1s.
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,Masterfuzzfuzz,5,Tue Jun 23 22:00:04 2015 UTC,"THHanson well its pretty easy. In 1v1 allies have a huge advantage, 2v2 is pretty balanced and with 3v3 and 4v4 axis get the upper hand pretty much. Since relic does only cater remotely for 3v3 and 4v4 most balancepatches are aimed towards 2v2 and especially 1v1. This however quite obviously doesnt balance the 4v4 sperglordparties since they are a mess anyways relic never seemed to bother about it.(this gets quite obvious when they announced to bring up CoH2 for eSports/ESL) So people get toxic and say its relics fault that axis are so strong and they are such a nazi company (yes, its stupid but that happened). Thats one part of these people, then there are those refusing to accept that they got outplayed in a match. they get on forums/reddit and say its balance's fault and everyone wants easymode and people playing germany are nazis and - of course - that they lost instead of watching the replay and learning from their mistakes. Ofcourse these are quite prolly not all allied players but there are some special snowflakes in the community and they are pretty known already."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,shitfit_,2,Fri Jun 19 15:25:44 2015 UTC,"My understanding of the current balance, though I may be biased because I play primarily 3v3s, is that 1v1s are sided towards Allies because of their strong early and mid game ability to choke out both Axis factions, though I think the assumption that: More Players=More Axis sided; is a little off. Yes, when we get up to 4v4 levels of late game armor and the ability to blob as a team to hold areas to wait that out, I can see the game being Axis sided heavily just by the sheer ability to hit late game fairly safely most games. On the other hand I believe 2v2s and 3v3s are a bit off in your assessment. In 2v2s at least in my experience, the Allied sidedness of the game hits its peak, particularly because of size of maps and having only 2 players making tactical decisions around the early game power Allies have easier to execute. Typically in a 2v2 a well timed second or third push of infantry, and light vehicles, ie after a few early battles going reasonably even, can be done with 2 players forced onto only a single player, in many cases cutting off huge swaths of the map and getting squad wipes wherein the second Axis player if not already in place may be unable to help in any way positionally, or even make up for the attack in his own gains. 3v3s on the other hand I believe have a somewhat reasonable balance, though yes, trend more so on the Axis side, in my opinion actually the closest to a perfect balance though that is unreachable. In 3v3s a 2v1, 3v1, or 3v2 push is viable, and trust me, I have had it done to me and on several occasions it has been the nail in my teams coffin. Though in these case because of the nature of having a third player in the middle of the map, reacting to, if not being naturally prepared is something attainable for the Axis, though if not done properly, enough gains can be made by Allies to use a resource lead to shut down any potential late armor, ie aggressive tank destroyers, artillery and mines. I guess since I play this format most I have most of my insight on it, though in any case, I think it is at least somewhat reasonably balanced, I can see glaring weaknesses that both sides can exploit, though neither side like in 1v1s, 2v2s, or 4v4s, can play in a scripted conservative way that should nearly guarantee victory.   I'm up for criticism or thoughts on my opinion if anyone would like to have at it. I am sure there are some flaws."

CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,Masterfuzzfuzz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:00:49 2015 UTC,Why don't they balance the factions differently for 3v3/4v4 and 1v1/2v2?  Seems lazy and a weak excuse for a game that you have to pay to have a soviet commander that is viable online?

CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,zelkia,4,Sun Jun 21 21:19:33 2015 UTC,"well first of all relic is not as big as people seem to think they are. Balancing two ""gamebranches"" if you want would essentially mean balancing two games at once for the ""price""/income of one game. I am pretty sure relic simply can not do this due to limited manpower and limit funds. So they have to decide what to balance. They want to bring CoH2 to a broader audience to generate revenue (its a company after all) and this is not going to happen with 4v4s but competetive gameplay (thus ESL). Competitive is 1v1 currently and most probably will be forever in RTS, just watch starcraft. Secondly I hazard the guess that players in 2v2 and especially 1v1 are extremely dedicated to the game and as such are more loyal to the game than 4v4 players. Not all of them but I hazard a guess that there are a lot more ""casual""-players than in 1v1. I am not saying that being a casual player is a bad thing, but casual players will move along to the next game pretty fast while dedicated players will play for a long time and thus generate a constant stream of revenue. I hope that makes sense. gotta go my pizza just arrived"

With that said we do make fun of USF players for going easy mode :b  (unless they have like 15 APM or try to turtle for god knows what reason lol) bc vet riflemen are silly.   USF is super powerful and can easily stop axis from making it to late game IF the player has decent APM.  They don't even have to be a great player strat wise, just need high apm.  Russians have their own cheese but so does axis - mostly people have favorites and like to bitch about everybody else being OP all the time.  You will see this in literally any game with asymmetry.  99% of it is just baddies being bad plain and simple.  Easier to call somebody a nazi fanboi than admit you suck.

CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,LordRahl1986,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:17:39 2015 UTC,The 3v3 and 4v4 imbalance e really comes from the fact that most of then are wide open maps (besides shittard but who doesn't veto that arty fest) and Axis infantry excel at long range combat.  Scripts penal and to a lesser extent rifleman all have to close distance while the grens get to focus fire them at their most effective range. Coupled with the Lmg42 this is super lethal.  Support those grens properly with a hmg and a mortar maybe even a sniper and there is little the allies can do at that stage to break it. Wehrmacht can bold the line entirely with t1 and t2 units if you aren't bad.  OKW have the kubel and volts to step in for the hmg and grens. Sturm can be a stop gap if you use them correctly
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,relkin43,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:11:07 2015 UTC,"lol this amuses me greatly bc my friends always bitch about wide open maps ESPECIALLY when you get 4v4 maps with only 3v3 people bc allied flanking is devastating as fuck (shock troops/flamey assault engineers) to Wehrmacht.  It just goes to show that everybody has their opinions about their pet factionis and balance :3  You can't put HMG's everywhere and also; smoke.  Like...smoke.  Again, USF IS micro heavy and should never be played seriously by anyone who doesn't have high APM but open maps def can be exploited by allies because there are soooo many avenues to flank from and you can't cover all of them with HMG's - also smoke.  Also allied mortars >>>> axis mortars"
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,LordRahl1986,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:34:58 2015 UTC,"Wrong about the mortars, for one. the weapon profile of the K98 is that it performs best stationary and at long range. smoke grenades are good and all but you can simply repostion, or shoot rifle nades into the smoke. the axis mortar fires faster, has a smaller scatter and therefore is not the inferior mortar."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,relkin43,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:20:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like you're trolling me or maybe just don't play axis.  Axis mortar is horribly inaccurate and does very little damage.  Soviet mortars are pinpoint accurate and wipe entire squads with one shell.  I know all about the K98's dmg profile and that's what makes it so crappy at protecting flanks.  Low RoF, low model count, terrible at kiting those SMG toting badasses like shocks.  Disassembly and resetup time is a thing so it's not nearly as simple as 'oh just move' lol obviously.  By the time you get it disassembled they'll be at point blank range with those M1's and BAR's shredding your shit.  Ditto on the rifle nade thing, the wind up on that nade is fairly long and it usually doesn't do a whole heck of a lot against moving targets (though occasionally you get a kiss from RNGesus).  If you have trouble with axis infantry then you are simply bad bc axis has the worst infantry lol"
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,LordRahl1986,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:42:39 2015 UTC,"Are you high?  Honestly.  The Wehr mortar isn't called the turbo mortar for no reason.  Go look it up on coh2stats. Higher ROF, lower scatter.  Less models? Sure.  Soviets got their precision button removed, and the 120mm got nerfed again.  Seriously, if you have a problem with it, its your own fault.  My most played faction is Ostheer, followed close by USF, I play both sides, and actually look at stats before I say things.  Your coming with armchair analysis and acting like its fact.  There's wind up times and audio cues fo the smoke grenades, and its really obvious. the rifle nade is amazing, and it's one of those things you kind of have to understand how it works, becuase it IS effected by cover"
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,relkin43,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:58:43 2015 UTC,"Rifle grenade has it's uses sure but they're no silver bullet; soviet mortars are still much, much more accurate.  Actually go play them, look at their friggen drop circle compared to the german mortar.  If you can't hit shit, it's no good.  Also you generally only wipe a couple models at most with hits.  German mortar isn't worth using.  Mortar halftrack? Whole other story.   Russian mortars did get nerfed a little bit, they still do a lot of dmg but they don't seem to wipe full health squads with a single hit anymore which is cool.  Yes they lost precision strike (that was more of a decrewing tool imo) but they gained flares which aren't bad for obvious reasons.  Yes smoke has a windup so if you happen to be at that screen at the time or if you just concentrate all your forces on one point for some reason it's possible to run your HMG away but setup time still makes it easy to get flanked/let them in close if you just try to move back 10 feet.  Also regarding RoF and shit you should go back and reread pal I was talking specifically about the K98."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aee4d,christobevii3,0,Wed Jun 24 16:26:57 2015 UTC,"Because the Axis in 3v3 and 4v4 are far superior.  The axis lost wwII yet a t3476 can't even penetrate half the time or hit anything moving.  Now that they have ""tried"" to balance it slightly you have 90% axis and 10% allies when searching for games.

It can hit spread out infantry with decent success.  If you've already got a kubel, you can help it remain useful by using  wire to funnel enemy troops. This causes your enemy to blob if he's not careful when moving. The wire also protects against flankers and should make it easier for the kubel to escape in a pinch."

CompanyOfHeroes,3acdx0,CreepyOctopus,3,Thu Jun 18 23:28:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know if that's the faction design but the commander is absolutely vital for the soviets I tend to go T2 against Ostheer and T1 against OKW. T1 is nice against OKW as you get the scout car to deal with kubelwagens and the sniper+penal troops are great anti-inf. As long as you can handle and push back early OKW you'll be fine. However if you got T1 you probably want a commander with Guards like Guard Motor to deal with any vehicles. Depends, I tend to ignore fuel caches until at least a few minutes in after the first few conflicts. The early game is really important, don't want to waste your manpower on caches just to get knocked in the early game. Guards are pretty strong general unit as of late, the PTRS is pretty damn accurate these days and useful against light vehicles while DP is a good boost to anti-inf. Just don't get them in close combat and you'll be fine. Button is great in the later game to help deal with those pesky Panthers and whatnot.  It's what keeps conscripts useful throughout the entire match, using them to reinforce guards is also a good option."
CompanyOfHeroes,3acdx0,nicksam112,2,Thu Jun 18 23:45:01 2015 UTC,"Meta will change drastically by the patch next week. This might be the last chance to discuss the current Soviet meta, so why not?  Soviet lacks non-doctrinal heavy tanks that can go against axis amour late game. The only heavy (sort of) tank options are T34/85 and IS2, which are tied to 2 specific doctrines. I think that's not what the game makers intended. With the patch next week, heavy tanks won't be as big a deal anymore, and I expect other play style will become more viable, rather than always rely on heavy tanks.  Ostheer is a well-rounded faction while OKW is a bit extreme: they are very good at one thing but are terrible at others. Playing against them require specific knowledge about how the faction work. You should play some games as OKW, your games against them will improve a lot. Know thy enemy.  Getting the first T34 as Soviet requires 230 fuel. Fuel caches do not speed it up significantly. I suspect that you spend some fuel on scout cars, research molotov and AT grenade.  You don't need all of them in one game. Saving some fuel from them will help you get tanks faster.  I usually mix guards with conscripts to have a front-line force with versatile abilities and strength in number. They are not as strong as other factions' blobs though, so you always need to support them with weapon teams and vehicles.  Conscript merging does not belong to any meta. It is an useful ability that every Soviet player should use."
CompanyOfHeroes,3acdx0,SilverCurve,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:03:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting!  Yeah, my fuel tends to first go into other things, which explains the late first tank. Is a faster T34 worth it, though? I found the T34/85 quite good, but the default T34 didn't really impress me. It's not bad, but quite fragile so has to be watched almost as carefully as light vehicles, and it lacks any squad wipe potential.  Regarding OKW, what are their main weaknesses? I don't have the Western pack yet so cannot play as them now. One definite weakness I notice is that they suffer greatly from snipers, but other than that, they seem quite capable.  I'm definitely looking forward to the patch, after checking the patch notes. Coming from CoH1, perhaps my least favorite part of CoH2 is how games revolve around heavy tanks. Playing completely without tanks doesn't seem to be viable, and heavy tanks rule the battlefield, so almost every match against Ostheer ends with a fight against a Tiger.  Not sure whether these approaches are meta or not (haven't really started watching replays yet) but my preferred approach so far is, against Ostheer, to mostly do conscript spam, and against OKW to get an early Sniper and then aim for a Katyusha to hit their blob with.  Hmm, is there any merit to investing all early fuel into a T70 and using that as a shock unit?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3acdx0,SilverCurve,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:38:49 2015 UTC,"OKW don't have a real machine gun, so their early game tends to suffer against well-microed infantry. After a strong opening with kubel and sturmpioneers, all they have are volks to hold Soviet infantry for a while, until flak halftrack (or Luchs) hits the field. During that time, their army are weak against the number of conscripts, shock troops, light vehicles and machine guns. Even when they have a flak halftrack, a fast T70 or T34 could kill it and regain field dominance. OKW have to keep up with pumas against T34s for some minutes and wait for Panthers.  10 CP waiting for T34/85s is actually quite long. Without T34/76s, OKW doesn't need to get Puma, so they get Panther faster. Their first Panther would hit the field at the same time with T34/85s. So getting early T70 or T34/76 is still a viable option."
CompanyOfHeroes,3acdx0,velmarg,2,Fri Jun 19 01:14:31 2015 UTC,"Edit: Formatting of this comment came out a bit wonky and I'm out of time - hope it still make some sense :p  Well, I'll give my best ""what's up"" on this. I'm not a pro, but I have over 1000 hours in the game, and the vast majority of that has been spent at the helm of Yuri and his Conscript friends in the Soviet horde. I'll address each of your points now to the best of my ability.    The short answer to this is yes - Soviets depend on their doctrines. The old Soviet meta was one of relying COMPLETELY on call-ins (T34/85s, IS2, ISU-152) and ignoring T3 and T4 structures. For many, this holds true, but many more players are now teching as Soviets.   It's unlikely this was by design. In the eyes of the developer, no doubt a T34/76 for 100 fuel given its performance is balanced against a Panzer 4 with its performance at 145 fuel. I'd agree with this on paper. The trouble comes in when you consider the fuel you pay to field the units in the first place, and the risk factor that comes with that.  To put it simpler than that, a Wehrmacht player building a Panzer 4 is building a verstaile tank he hopes will survive for the entire game (and very often, they do). A Soviet player building a T34/76 is building a less versatile, less durable tank he, in most cases, expects will be destroyed.  It costs 120 to tech T3 and 100 fuel to build a T34/76. That's 220 fuel you've possibly thrown away when that T34 takes a Faust and a Pak shot and a hit from the Panzer 4 and goes down in flames. As the Soviets, you're investing roughly the same amount of resources for units that CAN be effective (and the T34 can do some work, if well micro'd), but are also very easy to lose compared to their German counterparts that require relatively little micro.  The conclusion? When you've gotten good with the Soviets and are able to effectively and confidently micro their fragile units like the T70 and T34/76, it's absolutely work getting them. Keep them alive and you'll be rewarded, as both see a boost in their rate of fire and accuracy with veterancy that turns them into infantry killing machines.   Players who lack confidence in their vehicle micro or simply don't feel it's worth the risk will hold out for those call-ins which perform much more in line with German armor in terms of damage output and durability.   It's also worth nothing that any Soviet commander that does NOT have a call-in armored unit should be avoided early on until you're very confident in your abilities.    If you're having an easier time against the Ostheer compared to the OKW, you're actually in a good place, I'd say. Right now, early to mid game, the consensus is indeed that the Soviets have an easier time against the OKW and a bit more difficulty with the Ostheer while the Americans have an easier time against the Ostheer and a bit more trouble with the OKW.    T1 is hard to beat in the early run against OKW - the Scout Car is, obviously, going to deal with any Kubelwagen threat and a Combat Engineer or Penal Squad equipped with a flamethrower can do some spectacular work against OKW infantry before the Panzershrecks start to appear in their hands.   On the other hand, T2 will give you access to a ZIS gun which (in tandem with AT nades) will allow you to deal with any Flaktruck that may appear. It'll also allow you to potentially destroy any OKW buildings you might discover. Bring a Maxim along to hold back any infantry counter attack for best results.   After that, I would choose T3 or T4 based on your commander. The IS2 and Guard Motor are well supported by an SU-85 from T4; the ISU-152 does well with a T34 supporting it.   Remember early game that any two squads together can overcome Sturmpioneers and Volksgrenadiers are weaker than your Conscripts at close to mid-range. Stay close and stay in cover for best results.   Against OKW, my build is typically Con Con Con AT nade. If he doesn't roll Kube, you'll still ready for whatever light vehicles will take the field. Keep in mind that every point on the map that you can control except for Muni points will reward some fuel to you. Stay aggressive, keep capturing territory and do your best to deny it to him.    After Con Con Con AT nade, I typically tech to either T1 or T2 and, not long after, get medics up. It's tempting right around here, if you've already selected a commander, to call in some specialized infantry like Guards or Shocks, or a Heavy Mortar, but you'll be better served if you get a fuel cache instead, and THEN call in that elite unit. The earlier you get the fuel cache, the better, but don't build it so early that you won't have enough troops on the field to stay aggressive. Well supported Maxims are a good way to hold and push the enemy off the map while minimizing your own losses and conserving manpower you might otherwise spend on reinforcing losses.   Guards are some of the most potent infantry in the game now. They're very effective against light vehicles and infantry, moderately effective against medium armor when hitting it from the side or rear, and, with Button, have great utility against heavier armor.    The DP upgrade is absolutely worth building on them - the PTRS does most of the model dropping, but the DP will soften up targets and give a steady flow of damage.   I wouldn't say merging is a big part of the meta per se, but it's definitely useful. Use conscripts to reinforce team weapons that are holding the line, then retreat the Con squads to get them back up to snuff. Conscripts can merge with Guards squads with no real loss in performance, but you shoudn't merge them with Shock squads, as the Conscripts in the unit will get the PPSH but not the durability, resulting a unit that won't perform as well as if you'd just reinforced it at your base.    Hope some of this is helpful!"
CompanyOfHeroes,3acdx0,velmarg,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:39:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, great post! A few obvious things that did not occur to me, like loading flame engies into Scout Cars - I've been using Penals only for that purpose, but engineers can also definitely be useful. By the way, what do you have to click to quickly unload a squad from a transport? When I click the squad and give a disembark order, it needs a location, and it always causes the transport to move a bit before unloading, even if I right-click pretty much where the transport is. I'm sure there is some ""unload right here and now"" that I am missing.  I also really like your perspective on the T34/76, seems to match my experience very closely. It's a capable tank, but it always feels like a risk getting it because it's fairly easily killed and then you've lose a fair bit of resources, while most other units are a bit more predictable in terms of their performance. I've also found out the hard way that a T1+T3 tech leaves a big gap in your AT capabilities, without ZIS guns or SU-85s. That leaves you with ""secondary"" AT like AT nades and Guards, but nothing with high damage and penetration."
CompanyOfHeroes,3acdx0,c_a_l_m,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:34:30 2015 UTC,"No prob! :)   Hrm, can't say off the top of my head on the disembark. I typically click the Scout Car, click the unit at the bottom of the screen where its showing the garrisoned units, and just right click right next to the Scout Car to take them out.   T1 + T3 is definitely rough. T1 is all about control - using your mobility with the Scout Cars to ensure you always have significantly more territory than your opponent. If it's going well enough, you CAN get a T2 structure up at some point, whether it's before or after you tech T3 or T4.   T1 to T4 can work very well against the OKW, as the long-sight on the SU85 can allow you to snipe their Schwerpanzer HQ and the Katyusha can punish a poorly timed retreat. T2 to T3 works because of that early ZIS (which can punish an overaggressive truck placement) and the T34's potency in general against OKW infantry.  All that being said, it's worth mentioning that a T34 worth a bundle of Conscripts and Guards to support can absolutely deal with a Panzer 4 or Panther. The AT nade is the key - in particular, hitting the tank from the side or rear with it (or, preferably, several). This is where Button can make a huge difference. This is kind of a lengthy process, but basically, like a recipe, you need:  3 Conscripts 2 Guards, both with the DP upgrade 1 T34/76  If you send the T34 in alone, the Panther is going to hunger for it, because a lone T34 doesn't stand a chance against it. This works better on some maps than others, but if you can keep your Cons out of LOS and bait him so that the Panther runs right past them, you can immediately fire off three AT nades into its rear (have all three Conscripts selected and just press E, then click. E, then click. E, then click. Boom boom boom).   Once it's disable, he's obviously going to try to back away to save himself. Use button to further slow his already lethargic retreat while driving around him taking potshots with the T34. Button will make it easy to keep your tank out of the line of fire of his turret, at least until the Panther makes it out of Button's range.   Ideally, the tank'll be dead before then. Also, pay close attention to the cooldowns on your AT nades. A lot of times when I do this, the Panther makes it out of range of Button, but another set of 3 AT nades will put it to sleep.   Also worth nothing that 3 AT nades (75 muni) + 2 Buttons (120 muni) + 3 AT nades (75 muni) + Mark, even, if you're feeling really angry (80 muni) = a whole fucking lot of munitions.   Also also worth noting that the above reference mentions Guards and T34/76 - something you wouldn't expect to see unless the player is using the Mechanized Armor commander which gives you Guards Troops and the ISU-152. The same strategy will work just as well with the T34/85, of course, if you're rolling Guard Motor.   The main thrust of the point is trying to bait the Panther to expose its rear or side to let you disable it with AT grenades :p"

Almost every time I lose against Ostheer it's because I cannot kill tanks. I've failed to kill a P4 with a Zis gun and IS2. It seems my AT guns are always either too far front (and get decrewed easily) or too far back (and get one just hit off). Should AT guns perhaps be placed to the side of my force, and not behind it? Or should they be used in pairs? I do okay killing tanks with SU85, but without T4, I suck at it."
CompanyOfHeroes,3acdx0,insaneHoshi,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:52:29 2015 UTC,"I think the general thing you want to do is this:   spread conscripts through the map, forming a line.  This is a, err, ""front line."" place mines everywhere.   behind all this, have a maxim or two for blobs.  behind that, have a ZiS.   Note that with your infantry vision it's impossible for your ZiS to get decrewed unless you screw up, because you have advance warning.  Tanks are faster than the ZiS and could catch it---except that they'll have engine damage from mines/AT grenades.   At every opportunity, advance your conscripts from cover to cover, taking care when creating salients.   Note that this doesn't use any special tools: just conscripts, a ZiS/SU-85."

If any the british were helping out the soviets but surely NOT the americans - in that timeframe. In fact the americans unloaded vehicles destined for the soviet union for own use after the attack on pearl harbour in december 1941.  tl;dr: deal with it, america did do jack shit while the soviet union and the united kingdom won the war."

CompanyOfHeroes,3aa8yr,iTzDusty,3,Fri Jun 19 00:39:07 2015 UTC,hard facts  in fact in 1v1s OKW is the worst faction. And I deem 1v1 and to a lesser degree 2v2 as competitive. 3v3 and 4v4 are just a huge mess fucked up beyond all recognition
CompanyOfHeroes,3aa8yr,shitfit_,2,Fri Jun 19 05:26:41 2015 UTC,"While I can't argue the statistics, these only applied to the top 200 players?  For the general people, like me, allies are way to micro intensive and therefore are harder to play for regular folks. I play mostly allies and have lost more games then with axis.  It's the same with other games some weapons/factions are stronger then others but require higher skill to be more powerful then the other, same with CoH."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aa8yr,Sheep190,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:08:42 2015 UTC,"Yep, these statistics take only the top 200 players into account.  I think the overall assessment that allies are micro intensive is rather odd. Ostheers 4-Man Grenadiere are micro intensive especially in the early game and Volks , although 5 man, require a fair amount of micro too since they can not win any 1v1 in the early game unless you outplay your opponent. An early retreat means you will not have enough firepower against the strong early game of allied infantry giving up ground while a late retreat with axis infantry can mean a squad wiped together with its experience. This is amplified by things like the clowncar or m20.  So in that regard If we assume that both players have the same skill level - which is due to the top200 limit on the website more or less given - allies are stronger by a wider margin in 1v1. 2v2s are rather balanced and 3v3+ leads the balance downhill in favour of axis. Its not always the factions 'fault' when you lose. Sometimes RNG fucks your over or the map fucks you over (langreskaya anyone?... -.- ) and sometimes the opponent player is simply better than you."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aa8yr,shitfit_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:28:17 2015 UTC,"What you're saying is correct but you forget to mention that early game you only have 4 - 8 units in the field, thus are they easier to manage, when axis have vetted/upgraded infantry they output vastly more dps or have more health thus making them better and easier in late game.  With Allies you keep microing your infantry, m20's (otherwise they get shreked) and your tanks."
CompanyOfHeroes,3aa8yr,Sheep190,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:39:42 2015 UTC,"vetted/upgraded infantry they output vastly more dps or have more health    Most DPS: Thompson Paras have the highest short range dps (16DPS/Model with thompsons) M1919 and BARs are potent upgrades for long and medium to short range respectively.  Most effective HP : Shocks with 727HP.  all models have 80HP/Model (except snipers) as thus all axis high DPS squads (Obers,Falls,PzGrens) have 320HP since they are 4 man squads, Shocks have 480 (6*80HP, but 1.5 armour = 480/0,66).  Its not like you dont need to micro axis infantry. A single mortar shell, zis barrage, scott shot can easily wipe the whole 4 man squad - there are three exceptions: Osttruppen( OP dps) Assault grenadiers(hardly high dps lol) And volksgrenadiere(not exactly high dps either). compared to:   Conscripts Riflemen Shocks Penals Guards Paratroopers  In that regard its far easier to keep allied troops alive."

CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,Repost_Hypocrite,24,Thu Jun 18 23:05:45 2015 UTC,"Impressions:   Mother of god. Finally. MANUAL GARRISON FACING. Seven years I've waited, and it's finally fucking here. Cannot wait to try this. Super heavy call-ins limited to one. Lots of people going to talk about this, some upset, but this will make the game a lot better. Holy shit, they snuck this one in there: Incremental accuracy multiplier changed to 1.15. That means that every model near the target increases accuracy on HMGs by 15%, stacking. This is a huge lethality increase against blobs. 5% Bug 2: 5% Harder is now fixed, finally, more than a year after launch. This one was absurd and deserved to die. The bigger deal are engine damage reworks for munitions-powered snares, which are great changes. I would not be surprised if munitions snares get ""Crew Stunned"" over 75% damage in the future, though. A permanent effect is too strong; no effect is too weak... I think a temporary debuff would be great against full-health tanks. Flamethrowers getting a good tune-up to make them less reliant on crits. Side note-- this will make them weaker against retreating squads, but they won't be wildly variable against high-health squads. Still motherfuckers against low-health squads. Vastly worse at point-blank range against full-health squads overall, but much stronger at max effective range. Fuck precision strike, good change. Still think that mortars are stronger in this game than vCoH and too prone to hits that you cannot respond to. That's everything, though, and the high long-range and explosive lethality is going to take a huge patch to fix, if they ever choose to. It seems to be by design, which bums me out. SU-76 change is very interesting. Have to see how that projectile performs against tanks, but that's legit penetration. Not to be an ass, but it's absurd that Hold Fire on camo units took this long. IR Halftrack just got became essential in team games. No fuel and 200 manpower for perfect artillery strikes? Done and done. Still shit in 1v1. Raketenwerfer is reintroducing toggle camo, hate this. I would have preferred an active ambush ability that reduced range but hit like a truck from cover. Stuart changes are appealing as hell. An effective Stuart fits right into the tempo abuse that Americans are capable of, so these changes are hot shit. It was so worthless, it took me a solid minute to even remember what tier it was in. I don't think it was ever correct to build one.   More as I think of it. I can also answer mechanics questions if anyone is interested!"
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,troglodyte,10,Wed Jun 17 21:04:07 2015 UTC,guards are still bad?  have you even played since the last patch?  they absolutely murder infantry and and now are gonna be even more relevant due to less heavies.
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,blueey755,3,Wed Jun 17 21:13:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I removed it because I realize it's an unpopular opinion, but I haven't had any issues absolutely dominating them and stealing their weapons since last patch, and I've not been nearly as impressed as most people were. I prefer a Shock T2/T3 strategy and crush them early over using Guards, but that's probably just personal preference since I'm an absurdly aggressive player.  I removed it to acknowledge that I may have gotten lucky, encountered weaker players, or used strategies too narrow to be justified as counters."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,troglodyte,3,Wed Jun 17 21:19:56 2015 UTC,"On top of that, they should be less of the weapon piñatas they once were."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,nickbass95,3,Wed Jun 17 21:57:08 2015 UTC,"Everyone seems to be worried that the heavy limit will make Panther spam too powerful. But do you think the AT gun death-mechanic changes might help with this?     I feel Panthers are designed to be ultimate vehicle counters, even against AT vehicles. And the range advantage the 85 and Jackson had is easier to close with the AT nade change. So they should be countered by handheld AT. Yet Allied infantry have god-awful AT options (zooks and Guards), such that the Panther's ""low-dps"" MGs still out-damage AT infantry.    That leaves AT guns as the last possible counter."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,AsskickMcGee,7,Wed Jun 17 22:51:57 2015 UTC,"AT guns are underused anyway. I'm a big advocate of them, and yeah, it's gonna take several to stop a Panther, but in echelon they will stop that tank if it's not supported well. I'm not sure how often I see the death mechanic, to be honest-- mostly on the third or fourth recrew, which is pretty rare.  What makes me most excited for this patch is that it really does a lot to drive home combined arms rather than super units. AT guns alone are not the answer, and neither are handheld AT weapons or MGs. But the three combined form a very effective area defense in 1v1.  And as always, if they have more Panthers than your weaker tanks and AT guns, you're behind anyway and you're gonna have a bad time. One of the concerns about the ""Panther Spam"" fear (it's been around since vCoH) is that too many people fail to understand that if they have more than a single Panther against your empty field, the game was already heavily tilted against you. The unspoken third counter is manpower damage and aggression when tempo favors you. If you're playing Americans and he's kept enough Grens to push you off your AT guns, then you didn't capitalize enough on those phases of the game when you're strongest."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,troglodyte,5,Wed Jun 17 23:45:18 2015 UTC,"When I mention counters and balance I think it's sort of implied that we're talking about power on a per resource investment basis, not per unit. I still think it's both manpower and especially fuel-efficient at killing infantry and vehicles, though. Of course I don't expect a single Jackson/Sherman/34/SU85 to take on the higher-cost Panther, but any two of these (the combo always costing more than a Panther) still has trouble killing one before one of the duo dies. Then the Panther backs up with 1/3 health for free repairs while the Allies eat the cost of a tank.    And I'm still not a fan of counting early vs. late-phase strengths as balancing mechanics, especially since late-game becomes a much bigger fraction of total game time in team games. Of course, we'll have to see how these medium vehicle changes affect game phases. Part of the problem with short mid-games is that the tech was easily skippable."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,AsskickMcGee,4,Thu Jun 18 00:10:38 2015 UTC,Easy 8 in 4v4 with limited heavy tanks is nice. Never tech bro
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,christobevii3,5,Wed Jun 17 23:30:25 2015 UTC,"SU76 still not good because its in the same factory as SU85 which is superior.  Tie that up with the increase cost of SU76 now and even more reason to get SU85.  If you want artillery you get Katyusha, if you want TD you get SU85. SU76 is kind of in between and not good at either.  And even with the buff SU76 can't deal with tiger/panther which will come out shortly after you make the fuel intense t4. So by the time you can SU76 which in theory counters T3 osteer, they are not far from heavy tanks which don't care about SU76, so you get SU85.  Edit: while the Stuart buff is nice and might help the issue is that people will still most likely not go for captain and go for lt especially if you are airborne. M20 comes out faster for timing push, AA is better vs infantry, and you still get snared by panzerfaust because Stuart is light tank."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,MolotovFromHell,6,Wed Jun 17 22:13:23 2015 UTC,SU76 and T70 should have been in different tiers since launch. I makes so much more sense.

CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,Orestes910,2,Wed Jun 17 20:58:27 2015 UTC,Problem with that commander is that you don't have early game power that is equal to shock rifle or guard motor. You are putting your bet on late game where Germans are strongest. It is much harder to pressure the Germans during early and mid with this commander and without good pressure you will have to deal with a lot of late game German armor.
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,MolotovFromHell,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:55:37 2015 UTC,"While Shocks and Guards are great and all, I don't think either Allied faction should really have trouble pressuring Axis early unless they've started MG spamming. Plus that huge late game advantage isn't as big now."

CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,Whiski,4,Wed Jun 17 21:22:51 2015 UTC,"Panthers just got a huge buff.  Soviets got nerfed hard.  Now you can have only 1 heavy tank so --> spam ""medium"" Panther tanks. Only 1 IS can oppose you now. Combine that with the no snare when above 75% hp you can dive like crazy without being worried of pesky conscripts throwing a AT grenade in the back...  And soviets oh man... Goodbye 120mm.  EDIT: They wanted to have more viable options. What they did they nerfed one of the only two viable options of Soviets: Shock rifle.  Expect lots and lots of Guard Motor now, even more then before. Even with the HM nerf it's still better because you have a better shot in late game now since you can keep calling in T34-85s... Which plays straight into the hand of the Panther buff I mentioned above.  EDIT 2: Now if you flank a tank and want to snare it before you move in your T34-85s so it doesn't run away, you can't because that tank will not be below 75%  unless you throw 3-4 AT grenades at it. This makes life much much harder for allies.  The only thing that remains is mines for Soviets. I hope you are used to using them. USF have nearly no way of snaring a Panther or Heavy tank without committing to an attack first.  To sum up: German tanks became more forgiving because of the snare change. Allies have to commit all the time now if you want to snare the heavy and Panthers which is the most reliable way of killing them, especially Panthers which, again, got a huge buff."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,MolotovFromHell,5,Wed Jun 17 20:35:22 2015 UTC,Works fine for the US as you have no heavy tanks

It states this change was for the increased utility for light vehicles but there at the end it says it will engine crit mediums and heavies below 75%. So will it still snare all light vehicles at full health with the first shot, or will they too need to be below 75% health? Also, and sorry if I'm asking too much here lol, but if the faust/grenade surpasses the 75% threshold (say a medium at 76% health) will it crit or does it need to be below the 75% threshold first?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,relkin43,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:37:37 2015 UTC,"It has to be at 75% first I'm pretty sure, but yeah they are pretty confusing.

Guess that would make the clown car with flamers even more dangerous though."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,velmarg,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:38:56 2015 UTC,Well 90% of fausts usefulness was before you could field a pak so you could build more grens to deal with allied infantry hordes.  So...what use are they now?
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,gokkel,5,Wed Jun 17 19:11:22 2015 UTC,"90% of the faust's usefulness was to snare a vehicle - not destroy it. The same applies to Soviet AT nades and USF riflenades. The changes here make light vehicles more viable because a single faust/nade is no longer sufficient in most cases to snare.  2 of these attacks together will be enough, in most cases, but this change should increase the survivability of units like the 222, the T70, the OKW flak truck and more."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,velmarg,8,Wed Jun 17 19:37:24 2015 UTC,Read the change log again:   Can no longer deal Engine Destroy critical Can no longer generate critical to units over 75% HP for Medium and Heavy Vehicles   The second change does not apply to light vehicles. The first thing was very rare anyway from my experience. So all in all light vehicles will be as vulnerable as before.
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,nickbass95,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"This is pretty fuckin stupid then.

I guess the T34 sees a bit of love with this."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,essenceofreddit,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:02:40 2015 UTC,"It seems like they wanted to re-establish a midgame, which it appears they might have succeeded in doing.  Light vehicles are still vulnerable, but that makes sense, they're light vehicles.  Medium tanks definitely see a buff, now players can be a lot more aggressive with their P4s and T34/76s.  While I agree that I'd like to see more light vehicle play, it could be tricky to do that without making them completely dominant.  It's a fine line to walk, if they extended the 75% thing to light vehicles you'd see absolute dominance of 222's/M3A1s/M20s/etc, something most people wouldn't want."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,m00m00Farm,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:46:46 2015 UTC,"They would still damage it. I think the change is to not let you get away with fausting it once, retreating, and waiting 3 minutes for your own tank."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,rshunter313,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:10:58 2015 UTC,To further put the hurt on a retreating almost dead tank so it doesn't get away. And the changes to the death crits will be more punishable to the player who over extends.

Now if you flank with infantry before bringing the AT to bare so the tank doesn't run away, it won't do anything because guess what it's not below 75%.  Even if you wait for the first shot you better pray it penetrates so you can nade it right away. This makes life for allies much more difficult. The only way to kill ""medium"" Panthers and heavy tanks is to snare them first."

Bromao seems to contend that the buffs to the SU76 are, in fact, enough to make the vehicle worth the cost of the building.  That or he's being pedantic about my factually inaccurate, thematically correct, statement that they didn't buff ""any"" of the units in buildings people were already skipping.  but yeah, compared to a Zis, an SU76 is speedy and has a free barrage, sure.

If midgame strats involving Panzer IIs and armored cars become real, then the SU76, and by extension, its tier, become noteworthy."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a71iz,troglodyte,2,Wed Jun 17 21:14:56 2015 UTC,"Sure, that's the intent - but even a buffed SU76 comes out too late to realistically be touted as a counter to a 222.  It does come out as a counter to a Luchs but, unlike a Luchs which will murder infantry all game, an SU-76 is going to kill the Luchs and then lose most of it's intended purpose, no?  Things that kill infantry maintain utility.  Things that kill heavy vehicles maintain almost as much utility as people will continue building heavies and mediums in long games.  How many people, 55 minutes into a game, decide that a FHT or 222 is really what they need to wrap the game up?  Has your SU76 been hiding until that thing hits the field?  Even with the buff, the opportunity cost of building a building to get to an SU76 seems too high to me."

Well, until we see how the metagame shakes out, it is. In vCoH this would be worth a look if it timed similarly to a Greyhound, for example, but light vehicles just aren't as valuable in CoH2 as vCoH, so it's all dependent on what this does to the metagame.

The notes said nothing about light vehicles, so I think we can assume that they will be affected pretty much as it is currently.  This helps the annoying problem of driving a full health T-34 just in range of a Gren squad and getting an immediate engine damage from it.

CompanyOfHeroes,3a8ig1,tightropexilo,2,Thu Jun 18 05:29:17 2015 UTC,"Lightning war is pretty solid atm but its utility is going to drop post patch obviously.  You may consider encirclement (heresy I know) for use post patch as it will get you fast panzerschreck which will be immensely helpful with dealing with light armor spam that will be incoming.   Elite troops is actually going to be stronger for good players with the new heavy tank rules.    Spearhead (iirc this is the good one with the mortar halftrack) is freaking amazing if you play ost and should always be in one of your three slots.  Jaeger Infantry (can you buy this one?) is awesome if you have high APM; if you have average or below don't bother with this doctrine.  If you play team games then consider grabbing Luftwaffe Supply (LUFTWAFFLES!!!!) because that can be a great support doc.   Rifle Company is super good, rest are meh.  OKW Scavenge and their defensive doctrine (MG buffs and anti-sniper changes are going to help them immensely).

But I understand now that you can get them by simply playing... Then again you say that a commander is popular for 2v2, but I'm only interested in 1v1. So if you are on a tight budget, are there some must-have commanders? or should I just keep my fingers crossed for war spoils? Also ""starter commander bundle"" worth it?"

CompanyOfHeroes,3a8ig1,tightropexilo,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:54:48 2015 UTC,"For OKW I dont feel any neccissity to actually buy any doctrine. Breakthrough,Luftwaffe Ground Forces and Special Operations are all very good doctrines in their own regard. Luftwaffe is probably the 1v1 doctrine. Breakthrough's Panzerfusiliers are grenadiers on steroids und special ops has the command panther with 50% mark target and you dont need to tech. However you will cut half the doctrine because you wont be able to get Obersoldaten, which when equipped with STGs are reichdiculously strong (same accuracy on the move as if they are stationary and ignore cover apparently)."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a8ig1,shitfit_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:14:24 2015 UTC,"The problem with Luftwaffe is fallshrimjagers are too expensive to reinforce, who knows how the changes to snares will change their effectiveness and also the changes to the MG34 (increased suppression half damage) could be trouble.  Scavenge gives you JLI's which are good, infiltration grenades which are crazy good, especially vs garrisons which OKW typically has huge trouble with and the flakpanzer which might become better with the snare change. It's pretty much essential if you want to play on semoskiy"
CompanyOfHeroes,3a8ig1,tightropexilo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:44:15 2015 UTC,"I guess that the flakhalftrack will get an engine damage despite the 75% border since it will surely drop below 75% with one at grenade.  Although fallschirmjägers are squishy especially in 1v1 they are absolute beasts if brought up to veterancy 2.  MG34 should supress and not kill units primarily so I am 100% content with these changes.  JLIs are good, I'll give you that but they are purely support troops. Infiltration tactics are also in sepc op doctrine."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a8ig1,shitfit_,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:00:16 2015 UTC,The Flakpanzer (ostwind) not the flak halftrack  The halftrack is a light vehicle so the 75% doesn't apply anyway.

While true I personally do not have the fuel most of the time to bother with the Ostwind in 1v1s since I need the Panther ASAP. But this is just my personal experience and strategies between players and assessments concerning the current situation may vary."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a8ig1,shitfit_,2,Fri Jun 19 09:21:28 2015 UTC,I'd say elite troops will be a lot better with the heavy tanks change. Also close air is a must for any game. Lastly I'd say lightning and fortified to cover you're antitank and general versatility docs.

Regardless, it worked fine in alpha. Vehicles don't have to be afraid of one lone infantry squad, and tanks can actually tank a little bit of damage before having to worry about those same infantry squads.  Plus, fuck engine destroyed crits on handheld AT. Dumbest shit that has cost so many people close games. Glad theyre gone."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a7eaa,iTzDusty,2,Wed Jun 17 21:11:13 2015 UTC,"Eh conscripts don't get the armor bonus that shocks do so I only merged if it was necessary to keep from getting wiped.  IIRC in the alpha the 75% snare also applied to light vehicles so at least they got rid of that. Just wish they gave a bit of a boost to the damage handheld AT can do.   True on that destroyed engine crits, that was just ridiculous imo"
CompanyOfHeroes,3a7eaa,iTzDusty,2,Wed Jun 17 21:22:06 2015 UTC,"They arent as good for shock, but they save stupid manpower for guards.

CompanyOfHeroes,3a7eaa,Nautileus,3,Fri Jun 19 17:25:28 2015 UTC,Against the panzerfaust that penetrates all but the heaviest tanks at all angles this seems fair.   Against the russian AT nade and USF/OKW rifle nades which require positioning and timing even against mediums this is going to hurt.
CompanyOfHeroes,3a7eaa,Ragman676,2,Thu Jun 18 01:04:14 2015 UTC,"Since heavy call-ins will be limited, it's going to make light and medium vehicles a lot more viable. Before you had to be afraid of basic infantry squads with your T-34's, Sdkfz 222's and Panzer IV's, because even a single AT nade or panzerfaust could crit the engine and allow an AT gun or other infantry squads to finish the job."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a7eaa,Mandarion,2,Wed Jun 17 20:46:05 2015 UTC,"I think this a big help for Shermans which rely so much on mobility. Its awful to have the first squad it runs into take out the engine and have to slowly retreat. They are already thin as is, an instant knock out of the engines can be often fatal for the US tanks."

Well, not really. At least not against the USF, because by the time the Ostheer's medium tanks arrive (and yes, I'm following the game's classification of the Panther as not quite a medium tank, for balance reasons) the USF already has the ultimate counter on the field.   The Panzer IV has practically been worthless since the USF came out and got only slightly better in the last big patch..."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a7eaa,Teachtaire,0,Wed Jun 17 21:57:37 2015 UTC,So the strat of rushing Stuarts is better? I mean...armor pen buffs to MG's make the 222 even less useful; at this point they should just remove it from the game because it serves no function.
CompanyOfHeroes,3a7eaa,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,2,Thu Jun 18 17:07:13 2015 UTC,"I like it. Right now, all it takes is one panzerfaust to make medium tanks and especially light tanks sitting ducks."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a697q,Yoshiciv,3,Wed Jun 17 15:39:23 2015 UTC,Yes.  There are a few bonus objectives you can recieve on a mission that restores points.  I think it's the ones where you go rescue allied troops trapped by the Germans.
CompanyOfHeroes,3a697q,tomdidiot,3,Wed Jun 17 16:34:23 2015 UTC,If I recall correctly a bit of manpower (5? 10?) is restored when you do a mission with one of the other companies

CompanyOfHeroes,3a697q,SausageStroker,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:52:22 2015 UTC,Does moving them through enemy territory in order to surround an enemy prevent them from restoring manpower? Or will they still get the 5 (?) manpower when another company completes a mission?
CompanyOfHeroes,3a697q,Katter,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:19:10 2015 UTC,I think they only get manpower when they are in an allied territory
CompanyOfHeroes,3a697q,Bromao,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:56:06 2015 UTC,"Okay, thx. Because it seems like if you really want to succeed you should be constantly surrounding territories to keep them from reinforcing in other areas, but then you usually won't be able to get those free reinforcements."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a697q,Katter,2,Thu Jun 18 10:49:00 2015 UTC,If you are playing on Hard mode you'll pretty much have to spend all your requisition on reinforcement.

CompanyOfHeroes,3a7xi0,Teachtaire,5,Wed Jun 17 22:49:25 2015 UTC,What I think we'll see    A lot more light vehicle and medium tank play Panther spam/complaints about panther spam Soviet T4 becomes god tier thanks to the new buffed SU76 and Katyusha Guards becoming even more viable as they aren't pinata parties anymore Stug parties
CompanyOfHeroes,3a7xi0,nicksam112,3,Wed Jun 17 23:46:19 2015 UTC,"I think something need to be done about Soviet T3, even before this patch, it sucks. Only reason to get it is for a T-70 rush, otherwise T-34/76 really sucks."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a7xi0,HauntedGrass,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:01:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the T-34/76 outright sucks. They're good in massed numbers with Mark Target support. You can't rely on lone T-34's, but with combined arms support they're pretty good, too. Just needs some micro."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a7xi0,Nautileus,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:21:51 2015 UTC,This patch makes the t34 76 a lot better. Now you can go for crushes on inf without worried about getting fausted. They also buffed the half track.
CompanyOfHeroes,3a7xi0,tightropexilo,0,Thu Jun 18 01:55:47 2015 UTC,SU-76 is tier 3
CompanyOfHeroes,3a7xi0,SilverCurve,3,Thu Jun 18 03:24:28 2015 UTC,Read the patch more carefully. HT is light vehicle he will still get engine damage as easy as before. Only new thing is that they won't get engine destroyed now.
CompanyOfHeroes,3a7xi0,MolotovFromHell,2,Thu Jun 18 04:53:23 2015 UTC,"Its half the changes to come. The most interesting this that we rly need to look at is the heavy tank call in limits. CoH2 has relied HEAVY on these call ins and its always good to see changes.  The PTRS drop rates were very high almost to the point that guards were pinatas. Soviet creep barrage is a good change from the precis strike. SU-76 and the Stug got a buff so idk why you want to make it seem like only allies got the buff. Stug is very good for what it costs in this patch. Allies will get damaged engines but not destroyed engine from non mines. Plz make sure you read the patch, once a vehicle goes below 75% health is when you will start seeing crits happen."

CompanyOfHeroes,3a7xi0,relkin43,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:05:52 2015 UTC,"I only play USF so I'm a bit biased. I tend to skip the MG and go for the M20 off the bat, capturing a MG or maybe dropping one in as I play airborne the most. I'm glad they made it a bit more of an option as it felt a bit underwhelming. I'm really glad shermans cant be knocked out by the first panzerfaust now either. They rely on mobility and to have the first squad they see disable them and possibly finish them off due to their extremely light armor was a bit frustrating. I tended to always favor the Jacksons because of this as the Sherman seemed too risky."

CompanyOfHeroes,3a4r53,Rumsies,2,Wed Jun 17 15:41:29 2015 UTC,I don't see what the problem is. You guys literally destroyed every fhq he built.
CompanyOfHeroes,3a4r53,EricH4753,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:50:25 2015 UTC,"Theres an easy way to balance forward HQ, you have to hold the terrietory before you can apply the forward hq to a building. At the moment iit's op as fuck but that would be an easy fix."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a4r53,EricH4753,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:44:46 2015 UTC,"Not really op, late game he is screwed since Russians rely on call in for late game. Second you can easily end fhq's by getting flame pios and burning the building down. Once the game shows the building on fire, it will burn to the ground. 60mun for 60fuel, or you can have an okw fuel rush a stuka can get it very early if done properly . Lastly you can simply get lots of support weapons and force them to retreat. Just don't let them get the key building for it and hold your position slowly backing off and let him overextend. Then strike the building."

CompanyOfHeroes,3a4r53,CyriusBloodbane,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:37:04 2015 UTC,Look at replays On coh2.org and watch how others deal with it. Its hard to hold your ground but it is possible spread them out and don't try to fight them at the hq.
CompanyOfHeroes,3a4r53,EricH4753,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:59:14 2015 UTC,"Ok, even if it's not op do you not still think holding the territory to place a forward hq makes more sense anyway? I can't place bunkers in territories I don't own."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a4r53,Rumsies,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:47:54 2015 UTC,A bunker doesn't cost 60 fuel.
CompanyOfHeroes,3a4r53,EricH4753,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:20:41 2015 UTC,It makes sense but I don't think they'll change it. I was just trying to help you fight them since you said they are op.
CompanyOfHeroes,3a4r53,CyriusBloodbane,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:38:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand there are ways to counter and I'm always very weary of it, but there have been games where I knew it was coming, prepared for it and did everything that everybody here said to do, but  when a four man uses we fell too far behind on fuel and territory and it's gg. It is a cheap way to win for sure and that fix can't be that hard to implement."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a4r53,CyriusBloodbane,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:33:47 2015 UTC,The thing is its not hard to counter that's its fatal flaw if you can't push thr hq flaw then thats on your part not the balance. There are significant delays fhq gets I can explain them if needed. I do not think its op personally
CompanyOfHeroes,3a4r53,CyriusBloodbane,0,Wed Jun 17 18:08:21 2015 UTC,"I am not on COH2.org, because this game can be addictive enough, but here's a tense game against a strategy many people consider imbalanced, on a map that's ideal for it.   I personally don't think Urban Defense would be imbalanced if a FHQ awarded your units veterancy for destroying it. Alas, there's something of a gap here. I'm unaware of another asset in COH2 that, if destroyed, doesn't grant the destroyer vet. Frustrating.   Let me know what you think of the replay (apparently you have six days to watch it). Suggestions or tips are always welcome."
CompanyOfHeroes,3a15a3,rowan112,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:25:42 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I don't have an answer for you.   But I will say that the thought of running COH2 at 4k on an Intel GPU nearly made me spit out my coffee. I've got a 750m and a Haswell GT2, and I had to make some deep cuts to make it run OK on the former.  I'm not 100% sure how it works, but I do think it's possible these days to output to a different screen than the graphics card is connected to. You might want to check to make 100% sure it's not using the nVidia card and it's just the screen that's wrong. If it's on the Intel, I'd expect to be getting ~1fps."

As soon as the game's servers were shut down and SEGA was handed ownership of the title, it all seemed to go to shit. Nothing worked, and SEGA didn't even try to fix it.  The game wasn't fun to play anymore, the ranks were gone, and you couldn't even swap start locations. So I even stopped looking forward to CoH2, and after buying it on sale, I realised it wasn't even close to offering what CoH had originally done.

When I finally logged on and saw what it actually was I was so upset. I was expecting it to have RPG elements behind your forces like Dawn of War 2 had, but no, instead I get to choose between 2% penetration on my T-34 or 4% armor on my sniper. Then you had all the commanders that were included in the digital collector's edition (which I foolishly purchased) that ended up all being the same crap shuffled around. It was crushing to turn on the game and see that instead of a dynamic army building system. Imagine if each match you played against a unique style and army build rather than looking at their 3 commanders and determining that their going guard motor because of all the 120mm bulletins...   In the end, I think I liked the premade doctrines in the last game better. At least they had a coherent and unique play style."

I aint all too great but there are some retarded motherfuckers who play as allies.   That in particular is why I don't like playing as allies in anything but 1v1 because Germans clearly have a lategame advantage, especially in 2v2 and up and allied players who don't know what the fuck they are doing guarantee a loss.  1v1 is the only game were it truly is balanced."
CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,FantaToTheKnees,2,Tue Jun 16 01:13:48 2015 UTC,1v1 is the only game were it truly is balanced.   not exactly. In 1v1 allies have the advantage. check out this very informative site from chokunoku. It factors in the top 200 players. It shows that 1v1 is slightly slanted towards allies while 2v2 is slightly in favour of axis.

It factors in the Top200 players and as such is a very very good indicator about the strength of each faction in each gamemode. USF fall back pretty rapidly in competitiveness the bigger the game mode gets.  All endgame units or tanks doesnt mean jack if you do not get into lategame and you might want to consider that the IS-2 is the most cost efficent tank in the game.
CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,TwatBrah,-1,Tue Jun 16 12:01:03 2015 UTC,Is2>all german armor
CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,Gdott,-4,Tue Jun 16 14:28:25 2015 UTC,thats debatable. Its good but I'd rather have 2 t34's and a t70. have an AT gun backing the 34's and not even a Tiger could take them out.   edit: a tiger could not take out an IS2 with an AT gun either. I realized that after i typed that. But 2 tanks and an AT gun plus an infantry wrecking machine seems more worthwhile to me in 1v1.  the t70 takes care of infantry (aside from volk schreks) in a heartbeat. nothing can beat that except a bigger tank or bazookas.
CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,Gdott,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:46:35 2015 UTC,"Is2 fulfills a different purpose. It's a breakthrough tank, its the center of the action. It can take and deal massive damage. T34 85s are great but generally you don't run them head on into the enemy.  Both are good and fulfill different roles. In 2v2 a pair of 85 and an is2 is a force to be reckoned with especially if mark vehicle is used. Is2 is the shield and the t34 is the hammer."
CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,Atrixer,-4,Tue Jun 16 17:14:04 2015 UTC,"yeah it depends on the situation. As a win tank, not so much. as a great support tank to take out emplacements and dug in defenses, absolutely."
CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,edp-f,-2,Tue Jun 16 17:22:39 2015 UTC,"they have great call ins because their non doctrinal units are no where near as good as axis, so it practically is essential for them. As Ostheer, you could still win without even choosing a commander cause all the units you need are readily available, they just need to be built. As allies, you practically need them or you're going to lose."

CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,anon4773,-1,Tue Jun 16 17:22:34 2015 UTC,I don't claim that. In fact I actually do think its fairly balanced. And no I am not new.
CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,edp-f,0,Tue Jun 16 17:31:29 2015 UTC,"It's because the Germans are easy to play, forgiving, and consistent. I always play Allies, and prefer the play style. But it's kinda funny seeing 90% Germans every game because they are super easy to play. The Brits will change it for a week, but it'll go back to Axis favored simply because of how they are designed, and balanced. Relic have always had an erection for German units."
CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,anon4773,4,Tue Jun 16 13:57:45 2015 UTC,"No...  Right now USF is by far the most forgiving faction.  Because the majority of your army is riflemen, if something goes wrong you can just retreat.  The combined arms nature of Ostheer means that if your weapons get caught out of position you run the risk of losing them.  Now in late game, LMG Grens wreck everything, except for dual LMG 1919 riflemen, which is OP as fuck late game.  Also I take issue with your notion that germans are EZ mode, considering double OKW is the least winning combo at the moment.    Axis tank play is much more forgiving though, I do agree (excluding all OKW vehicles except for KT and Panther).  At the end of the day though, all factions have commanders, units, and strategies that are annoying as fuck to deal with.  You just have to live with it.  I find CAS support just as annoying as guard motor spam. I rage just as much trying to kill a KT as I do an IS-2.  The only thing I truly think is unbalanced is the Soviet late game squad wiping power because of Ost 4 man squads.  It is what makes the ISU and pre patch B4 so effective.  Precision strike is still on my list of annoyances that doesn't have an equivalent on other factions."
CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,edp-f,2,Tue Jun 16 14:21:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think OKW are easy mode, I was referring to Ostheer and should have said that really. I mostly play team games, and I know Allies are in a better spot in 1v1 - 2v2 atm, because OKW are pretty meh.   I feel that in terms of play style, Ostheer are more forgiving and easier to play. Their Infantry is generally higher HP and higher armour. Their tanks are fast, well armored and high HP. I LIKE that that Allies feel like underdogs, an uphill battle, that's why I play them. If the Germans felt under powered I would play them.  I do think Soviet late game is balanced in all honesty. Their anti-infantry is strong but the Germans get just as good, if not more effective units in every field.  I think it's unfair to called the USF forgiving, when their units are incredibly squishy, and their tanks cannot take a hit. They are high risk, high reward, that's the entire premise of their playstyle.   I think overall the balance is fairly good but the play styles are evident. I do feel the OKW are in a bit of a weak place, but they are hard to balance, because a few tweaks and they would be far too powerful. In terms of team games, Allies flat out suck in 3v3 and 4v4, because these games come down to well placed arty and tanks, Panthers dominate here."
CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,anon4773,3,Tue Jun 16 17:52:37 2015 UTC,"Bro, Riflemen with lmgs is 280 mp and 140 muni, they should win.    Then that squad gets riflenaded and possibly wiped.  They can't fire lmgs on the move and they can't stay put for fear of rifle nades.  Which to match the 140 muni USF spent on the extra lmg each gren squad can fire 2 and a half rifle nades.  Grens are still the most cost efficient, versatile infantry.  USF has some serious manpower bleeding issues in the late game.    USF is not the most forgiving.  The Soviets with 20 mp a conscript model and 6 man everything that can survive a trip to squad wipe city are."

Then that squad gets riflenaded and possibly wiped.   I always hear this. but to be honest it is a L2P issue.  You have to listen for audio cues, which is why I don't understand people who listen to music while playing.   Grens are still the most cost efficient, versatile infantry.   Slightly cheaper yes. But I think most versatile goes to rifleman, as it should be because they are the absolute core of USF. Riflemen get nades, smoke (amazing ability), bars/lmgs, tank snare (not the best I know but not the worst either), bazookas to crush light tanks and scare medium armor away.  It is possible to win riflemen only. Tough, but possible.  I don't think any other faction could do that.  For shits and giggles I have actually been trying to do MAN POWER ONLY STRATEGIES with USF, OKW, and SU.  It hasn't worked yet but I remain hopeful.   USF has some serious manpower bleeding issues in the late game.   Agreed, particularly when people use the pop cap trick.   USF is not the most forgiving. The Soviets with 20 mp a conscript model and 6 man everything that can survive a trip to squad wipe city are.   I agree, I should have said early game USF is more forgiving. You start with the strongest base unit, get more for teching, and don't have to worry about team weapons."
CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,Thejes2,2,Tue Jun 16 19:01:25 2015 UTC,"""I always hear this. but to be honest it is a L2P issue. You have to listen for audio cues, which is why I don't understand people who listen to music while playing.""  With that point you are assuming the player is focused on that battle.  In a 1v1 where you have 3 or 4 battles going on around the map it is easy to land a grenade and when they are as deadly as R-nades landing 1 out of 2 will certainly win games.  Also if the USF is grenade dodging they are not firing lmgs and are dancing around in favorable range for the grens.    Even the best players get hit by grenades eventually.  I watch plenty of good players and HelpingHans eats molotovs all day.  It is not a learn to play issue unless you eat every single grenade.  But to match USF dual lmg costs you don't have to land every single grenade to win engagements.    Smoke is good but Conscripts get Oorah which is an instant flank button.  Also cheap mines that give scouting information.  I suppose Riflemen are the most versatile since they can scale to the late game but cons are still pretty good.  Well the USF can certainly be deadly in a 1v1 but with them being micro hell and mp drain for days I find them pretty balanced.    Also USF team weapons blow right now.  .50 cals get wiped by R-nades so easily.  The only hope of using one against Ostheer is to leap frog it which is just dumb.  Also reinforcing the Pack Howitzer is obscenely expensive.  40 mp a model.  I think that is a glitch though."

I don't know why you think rifle grenades are so deadly. All grenades have the same damage and AOE except for the bundle grenades.   .50 cals get wiped by R-nades so easily.    All team weapons get wiped easily.  Explosvies are the team weapon hard counter.
CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,Foxbat226,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:45:36 2015 UTC,R-nades have crazy range.  You can be sneaky with them and fire over fences and stuff a lot easier.  Once a Gren squad is in sight an R-nade is an immediate possibility whereas other nades you have some more time to see them close the distance.  Other factions can't wipe team weapons at max range with grenades that their mainline infantry has.  That is the thing.  Ostheer has the team weapon hard counter in the flavor of no skill.  Walk right in front of an mg and you can still shoot a nade off.  Also Soviet weapon teams have a much better chance of surviving due to their 6 man squads.
CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,unique_string,2,Tue Jun 16 21:58:05 2015 UTC,"you can still shoot a nade off.    I agree, abilities should be disabled while suppressed.  This includes US Smoke."
CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,ben_the_impaler,-11,Tue Jun 16 22:23:04 2015 UTC,"lol german faggot alert  Hey why don't you play as USF? Rifle squads aint cheap and you only get 5 in a squad. You can make the same argument about any other german unit about   if anything goes wrong you can just retreat   1919 you have to commit to a sub par commander to get those so don't bitch about them having to choose a not so great commander to get them. plus they cost 10 more munis.  Axis play is not forgiving just less units you have to worry about. People don't want to worry about 12 units they just want 4 god-like units and not have to do any work. Thats why a lot of shitty players play as OKW in 3v3 and up. 1v1 OKW players typically know that they cant do that, cause they are the only ones ballsy enough to play 1v1.   Also the whole point of OKW is a ""Mobile Doctrine."" They base everything on vehicles. Plus you cant tell me that a Puma and 1 volk with schrek can't take out a t34, cause it easily can. hell even if the t34 wasn't paying attention to it and the puma got the first hit and the t34 missed, the puma could still take it out.   Also halftrack and luchs are really good against a soviet who doesn't have guards. Practically cheating.  Soviet late game lol. what a bitch, he thinks soviet late game is OP. B4 costs 600 mp, and is a rare commander that not a lot of people have unless they luckily got it or bought it. plus the KV1 with that commander sucks late game. You might as well have 34/85s.   ISU is pretty much an elephant to combat the bullshit heavy tanks of the germans.   dude shut.the.fuck.up. ur a butthurt german player who just wants the allies nerfed even more to make your win eaiser.  play as allies bitch and then tell me micro managing."

CompanyOfHeroes,39zaxr,edp-f,2,Tue Jun 16 19:04:48 2015 UTC,"lol german faggot alert   K.    Hey why don't you play as USF? Rifle squads aint cheap and you only get 5 in a squad. You can make the same argument about any other german unit about   That extra man really adds survivability, yawn.  And of course they aren't cheap, they are the best base unit in the game. Why would they be?   1919 you have to commit to a sub par commander to get those so don't bitch about them having to choose a not so great commander to get them. plus they cost 10 more munis.   Considering it is the current Meta commander (watch any high level USF play and they go Infantry) I am just going to say you are wrong.  For whatever reason, most low tier USF players can't get past the ""Durrrr need heavy tanks must get Easy 8"".  No high level player uses Rifle company, because why would you get an E8 which is worse at infantry killing than a sherman and tank destroying for a Jackson.   4 god-like units and not have to do any work.   Please, tell me these 4 god units that kill everything.   Also the whole point of OKW is a ""Mobile Doctrine.""   It is?  Must be why they get those base structures that can be put anywhere...   They base everything on vehicles.   Now I know you are just making shit up.  Because they get maybe 2-3 vehicles in a typical game (if one of them is a panther).   Plus you cant tell me that a Puma and 1 volk with schrek can't take out a t34, cause it easily can.   Yes...Why wouldn't it be able to?     hell even if the t34 wasn't paying attention to it and the puma got the first hit and the t34 missed, the puma could still take it out.   Possible but I doubt it.  Puma kills a t-34 in 4-5 hits.  A T34 kills a puma in 2.  Barring death crits for both.  Puma is a scout car/TD used to engage tanks at range.   Also halftrack and luchs are really good against a soviet who doesn't have guards. Practically cheating.   If you can't flank a Flak HT that is a l2p issue.  Luchs is good, but I would argue the T70 is the best light tank in the game, particularly if you are facing OKW and your opponent goes Panzerfusiliers Meta.  Also FHT hard counters Soviet T1. So you made that tech choice and either have to tech t2 for an AT gun or wait for T3 or go call ins.   Luchs is good but delays panther.  If you get it your opponent will get T34-85s before you can get heavy AT out.  I don't understand why most players can't grasp that choosing one strategy or unit will leave you weaker in other areas.  Also I think most players are too quick to try and react to a situation.  Again, watch high level play, most players kite initial armor if they don't have a counter and continue playing.    Soviet late game lol. what a bitch, he thinks soviet late game is OP   I can taste your salt from here.   B4 costs 600 mp   I said pre patch, when it could precision strike wipe anything for low price of 90 munitions (in a faction that pretty much always floats munitions).   plus the KV1 with that commander sucks late game.   Which is why no one uses it now.  Pre patch b4 was an iWipe death cannon.  They nerfed it and now the commander is no longer meta. No real surprise here.   ISU is pretty much an elephant to combat the bullshit heavy tanks of the germans.   If you need a ISU to counter a tiger then that is a l2p issue.   I actually don't know anyone who uses ISU for AT anymore.  They just use it as a squadwipe monster.Again, this unit is balanced now.  Pre patch it was a unit that could kill anything with the same range as an Elephant.    dude shut.the.fuck.up. ur a butthurt german player who just wants the allies nerfed even more to make your win eaiser.   I don't want the allies nerfed.  Contrary, I want the soviet call ins nerfed and their base units buffed to vary gameplay.   I think USF is in a very good spot right now, maybe make Sherman HE more damage consistent rather than lots of misses and then sudden squad wipe, but thats it.  Also anyone who talks like this obviously is a scrub who needs to Lrn2play.  Show your playercard and then you can talk.  I don't know why I even come to reddit to discuss balance.  Anyone who dares mention that soviets might be over performing just gets called an Axis Fanboy.    For those interested, all worthwhile discussion on this game takes place at coh2.org"

CompanyOfHeroes,39w63m,kebabskies,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:21:13 2015 UTC,I had the same problem as him. If the camera is the same it might be that they changed engagement ranges of units? It feels like you have a lot less overview about what's going on. You usually have to scroll around to even see all the units fighting in a single firefight.

CompanyOfHeroes,39tyh6,DontGetCrabs,14,Tue Jun 16 02:06:35 2015 UTC,"In my personal opinion, it does not. Company of Heroes presents war in a pretty brutal light.  Think about the voice line for Volksgrenadiers where, after reinforcing to full strength, the squad leader goes ""Yeah, yeah, you'll do, fall in line..."", in a very thoroughly tired tone. Consider the Soviets screaming how they hate machine guns while getting suppressed, or loudly exclaiming how they're getting tired of 'this shit' while getting burned by flammenwerfers. You've got soldiers freezing to death, bodies literally thrown into the air by explosions, final radio messages of vehicle crews getting cut short... There's a lot of brutality in Company of Heroes.  I think video games where you control a soldier or soldiers innately present war as somewhat exciting and fascinating. Not all war games do; This War of Mine is a good example of one that doesn't, but I'd say it's pretty much an exception, since it's built around showing off how terrible war is for the civilian population caught in the midst of it. However, I'd say Company of Heroes does a better job at showing the ugly side of the coin than most military-focused video games. In Calladoodies you're gunning down endless waves of faceless goons. Combat flight simulators have honorable duels between the knights of the skies. Even compared to most strategy games Company of Heroes is pretty damn violent.   For example, your Elite Longbowmen in Age of Empires II never complained of snow in their pants. They were faceless drones, obeying all your orders, shouting off one-word responses. Meanwhile, your conscripts yell out in frustration when suppressed, curl up to die when the cold finally gets them in deep snow and complain of... snow in their pants. They're humanized.  Of course, just because Company of Heroes is brutal doesn't mean it can't simultaneously glorify the war, but I think that in Company of Heroes, the ugly and the brutal aspects of the war outweigh the glorious and honourable ones."
CompanyOfHeroes,39tyh6,Nautileus,3,Sun Jun 14 21:56:46 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, I think that those brutal elements you mention could be used to argue that this does glorify war. It's all these horrific things, but it's a game, so it's supposed to be a fun time. Transitively, that would indicate that this realistic violence is part of what makes it fun.  Really I think it just amplifies the simulation factor, which is a big piece of its caché. It's hard to say whether a simulation of war glorifies it more than a war fantasy, I could argue it either way."
CompanyOfHeroes,39tyh6,Nero_,3,Tue Jun 16 04:14:06 2015 UTC,I guess it always depends on who's doing the interpreting.
CompanyOfHeroes,39tyh6,Nautileus,10,Tue Jun 16 11:18:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think it does a better job at portraying the realities of war than its predecessor. vCoH felt like glorified heroes fighting in the battlefield whereas CoH 2 does more of the same but feels a lot darker.  One of the biggest examples I can think of is vehicle crew deaths - in vCoH it was just boom and your vehicle blows up. In CoH 2 it's ""THE AMMO RACK IS ON FIRE! GET OUT GET OU-"" and the radio just cuts off mid sentence."

CompanyOfHeroes,39tyh6,Karmago,2,Mon Jun 15 07:56:40 2015 UTC,Maybe you're not paying attention?  These are ambient radio sounds that play when a unit is under attack or dying (which are generally quieter than the main radio voicelines). They're not triggered by you selecting/ordering them.

CompanyOfHeroes,39tyh6,Contaminator,3,Tue Jun 16 01:18:48 2015 UTC,"Specifically talking about CoH2 I think the game does not glorify war in any way. There is a certain amount of playing on stereotypes which bring out the grandiose romanticizing of WWII that many of us (American perspective) have been told is the truth. But that all of that is just peripheral association we don't necessarily realize.  In reality I think CoH2 has tried (way harder than the predecessor) to show how brutal warfare is. So yes the morbid statements and events that take place in the game are being effective if people are a bit startled or uncomfortable with them... we shouldn't be desensitized by war.  I have to say my favorite example of this in CoH2 is the USF rifleman says ""When I get home I just want to fade away..."" really puts the point on not only is war horrible for the people who died but it is awful for those who survive."

CompanyOfHeroes,39tyh6,DontGetCrabs,2,Sun Jun 14 20:55:16 2015 UTC,"The answer to your asked question is simply yes, the thing is, this glorification of war has been around FOREVER.  Playing cowboys and indians, the Romans would put on displays of old battles in the colloseum, games of chess.  We are competitive by nature, and war is the Grand Prix of competition, so to relish in the wars of past is more or less normal.  Now WW2 is such a unique war as the very visible advances in technology, tied in with recordable film, and the accessible records kept.  These things together for the first time in history SHOWED war as it was, so it became the first war in which anyone and everyone can actually begin to understand what war really is.  This makes WW2 a magnet for being ""glorified""."

CompanyOfHeroes,39tyh6,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,3,Fri Jun 19 04:53:27 2015 UTC,"Taken from /u/nicksam112's comment, it certainly Romanticizes WW2, and does so in a very strong way. This romanticism of modern military technology and total war is why people love playing as Germany and why there is still subtle glamorization of the Nazis. Even in Hollywood they exploit their image and ideals in this manner. COH 2 does however aim to capture the horrors of the eastern front. A lot of the death lines are much more gruesome than in the original CoH. The Grenadier's crying out about his missing leg and yelling ""NEIN, NEIN, NOT LIKE THIS"" as he burns sticks out to me. This is of course juxtaposed with the inevitable humor slipped into RTS games. Notably with the Soviets and their NKVD/controlling communist agenda. ""Your troops are freezing! Their clothes belong to the state"" or ""The base now includes a field hospital, but only for those who are seriously wounded!"". And this here is why the Russians are extra pissed about the game. It pretty much notions that the Russians didn't even own the shirt on their back under soviet control. It emphasizes the harshness of the Soviet government and NKVD over the harshness of the war on the Russian people and the desperation of the government to stop the Blitzkrieg, making it seem that losing the war and having the Nazis take over would have been a better option."

I always see this get thrown around but I believe it's a rather strong statement to make.   From what I've gathered from reading different memoirs and history records, at the start of the war, most Wehrmacht soldiers had a very positive opinion of Hitler. Fast and decisive victories at France and Poland also helped improving the soldiers' opinion of Hitler.   Now, this doesn't mean that every soldier was blinded by extreme fanaticism but, in general, most soldiers did have faith in the Third Reich and Hitler's rule. Most people tend to forget how charismatic Hitler was because we now see him as the crazy megalomaniac he actually was but, for most soldiers and the German people who suffered WW1, Hitler had a tremendous impact; he told them everything they wanted to hear. Promises of prosperity, taking back the old territories, restoring Germany to its former glory, revenge for all the wrong doings of their past enemies, etc.  Hitler stopped being seen as this ""almighty savior"" by the majority of the Wehrmacht after having experienced the war against the Soviets. One thing is celebrating a victory in Paris after a month of meager resistance and another one is crying yourself to sleep inside some factory ruins after fighting for a whole year at Stalingrad. As defeat became more and more apparent, soldiers started losing faith in the regime steadily fast. The only reason why fighting continued to be so fierce in the East was because soldiers knew very well their fate in the hands of the Soviets. That's pretty much the reason why German soldiers were so much more prone to surrendering against the western Allies."
CompanyOfHeroes,39tyh6,erik4848,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:18:46 2015 UTC,My apologies I shouldn't have said this so fast but from what I have read/heard/watched a large portion of the whermacht soldiers only joined because of the 'fatherland' not because they liked Hitler's ideas.

Keep it supported by infantry because it will be a prime target.   It is really good if your enemy is digging in with a bunch of bunkers or crew weapons. Plus its white phosphorous can take down infantry to 1 HP while shielding your guys. If you know where a sniper is operating, drop shells on him. If your enemy isn't constantly relocating he'll get blown up."

CompanyOfHeroes,39ugq8,tightropexilo,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:08:36 2015 UTC,"There is no easy way to deal with it. Try spread out and cap, it is a large manpower investment meaning he will be down on capping power. Being spread out may afford you a chance to flank it and even if you can't kill it putting damage on it early can severely shut down it's effectiveness until they make a healing bunker. Try to avoid a head on charge, especially if there are other troops supporting it.  Past that you need to chase it down with a light vehicle if possible.  In the late game the Scott does 100 damage per hit, snipers health is 82 so that can one hit it if you luck out. Other mortars do 80 (except 120mm) so they won't work."

CompanyOfHeroes,39rwa0,Repost_Hypocrite,2,Sun Jun 14 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"Buy rifle company, its the best doctrine for USF."
CompanyOfHeroes,39rwa0,Rivers24,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:03:24 2015 UTC,"ehhh, I'm gonna say its a close second to airborne, which is one of the starting commanders. P47's are insanely good against late game armor, and paratroopers destroy everything if you upgrade the lmg, and can drop behind lines and quickly blow up resources. You need to go heavy on munitions though. That being said I play almost only 3v3, rifle company is really amazing early game so maybe I'm a bit biased with the larger maps."
CompanyOfHeroes,39rwa0,Ragman676,0,Tue Jun 16 00:03:40 2015 UTC,Paratroopers are quite expensive and aren't that amazing unless you  upgrade them.
CompanyOfHeroes,39rwa0,Rivers24,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:15:36 2015 UTC,"They are, but the ability to drop them anywhere, like behind bunkers and blow them up with demo is pretty nice. Also you get 6 of them per squad which makes them hard to kill."
CompanyOfHeroes,39rwa0,Ragman676,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:30:17 2015 UTC,"It's good but P47 is better. Also I see too many players abuse the Eazy 8s, neglecting the hard AT that the Jackson provides. Easy 8's are good but are still fragile, and can have trouble against axis tanks without a Jackson behind them."
CompanyOfHeroes,39rwa0,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:05:18 2015 UTC,"Be aggressive with your riflemen. Push with them and cap with your RE squad. Try and skip either tier 2 or 3 if you're able. Bazookas aren't very good. Smoke can be super useful. It is really nice to get you vehicles out of trouble, which is great since every vehicle comes with a repair crew. Late game, only the Jackson is really good at AT, though a vetted AT gun can help a bit.   I hope some of those things help."

CompanyOfHeroes,39rwa0,USSZim,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:53:22 2015 UTC,"The riflemen are the best starting rifle squad (compared to grenadiers, conscripts, and volksgrenadiers), so use them to your advantage. In fact, they form the basis of the entire faction. Generally I send them in teams of at least two squads so that you can flank and destroy whatever you find. They really kick butt even against MGs because you just fire a smoke grenade at them and then get right up in their business.   Check out the guides on coh2.org for in-depth info"
CompanyOfHeroes,39rwa0,SilverCurve,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:25:43 2015 UTC,"Machine guns, bunkers, light vehicles are big challenges for new USF players. Keep an eye for them, and be ready to use smoke grenades, light vehicles, or anti-tank guns to counter them. Those units all micro-intensive, but they are the only hope for you to make a truly versatile US force."
CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,cradledcat,6,Sat Jun 13 21:26:56 2015 UTC,Problem is Soviets have some OP stuff and then everything else they can do is just fucking terrible thanks to crap tier armor choices.  T-34 85s call in is what?  260 fuel?  having a T-34 76 and an SU-85 to back it up is 465 fuel for building both buildings and tanks.
CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,anon4773,5,Sun Jun 14 06:32:05 2015 UTC,Soviet call in meta is best in game. T1 guard motor T2 shock rifle   These are the 2 best most cost effective tactics there are currently. Stock soviets isnt that great but their call in meta trumps all.

CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,insaneHoshi,0,Wed Jun 17 22:12:57 2015 UTC,A call in medium tank option. T34-85's have no peer in the Wermacht call in aresenal.
CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,DasArsenal,5,Sun Jun 14 19:31:59 2015 UTC,"10 Command Points though - I'd understand if it was 7/8 CPs and was a huge advantage, but it would be ludicrous to argue that 34/85s are hitting the field the same time 34/76s would be..."
CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,DasArsenal,-2,Sun Jun 14 20:53:49 2015 UTC,Yeah but the fact that you can get the two t34s at 10cp and then another set before the game ends - that's a ridiculous tank output as compared to the Wehrmacht.
CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,TheNataris,2,Sun Jun 14 22:47:03 2015 UTC,"That's 620 fuel, including the t1 and t2 buildings - which is enough for a Wehr to have, including tech, 4P4s, sooner and more frequently, or two panthers and some early game light vehicles.  The 85s are a decent call in but the fact that they only come as a pair is often crippling, especially after the first pair."
CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,DasArsenal,2,Mon Jun 15 04:15:46 2015 UTC,"That's sugarcoating it. T34-85s are better than P4s in almost every concievable way and in an even game they are going to absolutely destroy the P4s, even if we don't consider the fact that the same doctrines have access to Mark Target.  Add to that, in the current version of the game any competent SU is going to have better map control vs Wehr in the early game, and Wehr is most likely going to have to rely on a light vehicle to carry them through.  If we're talking 2v2 and up, things might be different since it allows for a lot more camping and thus slower CP gain, but in 1v1 it's not even close."
CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,TheNataris,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:57:10 2015 UTC,"You're right, they are better.  Because they cost more and come out later.  Similarly, it would be inappropriate to compare a t34/76 with the Tiger call-in."
CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,DasArsenal,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:55:04 2015 UTC,"So cradledcat's point still stands. You get an equal number of tanks that perform much better.  The T-34/85 is more comparable to the Panther than the P4 thanks to it's healthpool and armor.   And again, it only comes out very slightly later in 1v1. Like I said, 2v2 and up is a different matter."
CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,TheNataris,2,Tue Jun 16 14:10:21 2015 UTC,"Sure, as long as your basis is the Wehr player builds 4 P4s and stores them in his base, and the Sov builds 4 t34/85s in his base, and then they have a 4v4 tank Free-For-All on the north half of the map.  Otherwise, the 2-5 minutes of 1 P4 versus no armor isn't something to be discounted.  Unless you'd, of course, like to go on to compare how cost effective the Panther is against t70s or anything else that disregards game-time as somehow relevant to unit purpose."
CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,nicksam112,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:16:08 2015 UTC,"Not at all, but unless the SU is completely careless you're going to play it relatively safe with the P4. Losing it means you'll be facing 2 of those T-34/85 with one P4 that's Mark Targeted.  You will for sure regain map control, but it's not a fair comparison in my eyes."
CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,dr-pavel,2,Tue Jun 16 15:52:46 2015 UTC,"Hell sometimes you don't even need any teching at all. Recently I've been playing using con spam with Guards Motor and it works pretty damn well as long as you're aggressive.   That's just how the Soviet meta is at this point and how it's been for a while ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Maybe fuel prices for call ins or the CP needed needs to be raised, I don't know, but it is the only real way to play Soviet from my experience"
CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,basedyonder,3,Sat Jun 13 21:40:31 2015 UTC,"Soviets play a Call In game because their vanilla options are shit, it's as simple as that. Raise the fuel cost and they'll just find a way to last though the mid game a bit longer."
CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,nicksam112,2,Sun Jun 14 05:42:59 2015 UTC,"Maybe fuel prices for call ins or the CP needed needs to be raised, I don't know, but it is the only real way to play Soviet from my experience   Fast T-70 is pretty strong in my opinion. It's a far stronger option when you are in the lead by a considerable margin. Getting out a T-34/76 fast is also pretty good against Mechanized Assault because fuck Stug E's.  Other than that, yeah, call-ins are just too good at the moment, March Deployment + WFA made the medium tank phase way too short for my taste."
CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,basedyonder,3,Sat Jun 13 21:52:54 2015 UTC,"T70 is a fun little beast, but there isn't much time it's really useful unless you micro it well. Once the panzerschrecks are out it's one-hit, two-hit, good bye.  That's very true, I wish they lengthened the time that light vehicles+infantry are viable. Right now it's just a rush for the first medium tank, hell if you don't get a sherman by the 10-11 minute mark you're gonna be at a pretty big disadvantage."

CompanyOfHeroes,39qtvo,velmarg,2,Sat Jun 13 22:09:35 2015 UTC,"Ya, the T-70 always seems better than the Stuart IMO. Maybe they are evenly matched, but I just feel like the T-70 mops up troops way faster."

CompanyOfHeroes,39m4zd,nicksam112,4,Fri Jun 12 18:27:46 2015 UTC,"Tanks in general and heavy tanks in particular are far more resilient in this game than in real life - under normal circumstances, historical tank crews usually abandoned their vehicles or were incapacitated after suffering even a single penetrating hit.  However, this wouldn't be very fun to play with - imagine if your King Tiger could be disabled instantly in one shot if a Sherman surprised you from the flank or rear, or if an HE shot could destroy your vehicle's drive sprocket and make it completely immobile (in turn causing the crew to abandon it). Not the most fun for the player!"
CompanyOfHeroes,39m4zd,fetterkey,3,Sat Jun 13 06:21:11 2015 UTC,"You should see Men of War, you can individually target parts of the enemy vehicles, in some of the game you can directly control the vehicles and you can disable the crew of a vehicle to take over the vehicle."

There are a lot of reports of Tigers knocked out and many of these wrecks would've been observed by multiple parties.   Maybe there are only three very well known and documented examples that are 100% verified, but in my opinion they aren't the only times Tigers were in direct conflict with American tanks."

CompanyOfHeroes,39h9bh,tightropexilo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:11:13 2015 UTC,You may want to include Spearhead for OST. It's a pretty standard commander for OST and has everything you need for a good game. He should also probably get if he hasn't already.

Keep in mind though, the weapon icon underneath your units = the first weapon they upgraded with - for example, a rifle squad that picked up a BAR and then a bazooka will be shown with the BAR icon. You can kinda use this to hide the fact that your infantry have AT if your opponent isn't attentive enough (which I've done a few times).  ""Oh, BAR riflemen? I guess I can wipe them out with my upgraded scout car... oh I've made a huge mistake."""

CompanyOfHeroes,39g32e,DogbertDillPickle,2,Thu Jun 11 22:57:37 2015 UTC,Not sure that there is...haven't bothered for looking in several years. You'll learn to tell by the icon or by zooming in on the units quickly enough though. In the mean time just read the tool tip carefully while it's on the ground before you pick it up and then see what the icon is once you equip it. You'll memorize them quickly

CompanyOfHeroes,39dx8j,Slyckx,3,Thu Jun 11 09:25:07 2015 UTC,"From my experience that's what this game is like I say ""gl hf"". every game and usually get it back. Sure there is a few outliers that act like children just like any game. But for the most part its good. I've even had chats with the opposing team after the game talking about strategies. Definitely not the most toxic community ive seen by far. First person shooters are even worse."
CompanyOfHeroes,39dx8j,THHanson,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:31:06 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I've had some great chats too. One time I was on a 5 or 6 game losing streak, all of which were against opponents who were WAY better than me. I said as much to the guy I was playing, something along the lines of ""matchmaking keeps pairing me with people way above my skill level."" His response was ""maybe if you keep complaining you'll get better."" Thanks, random guy. You could have given me a tip, acknowledged that we probably shouldn't have been playing each other, or at least sympathized with someone who hadn't had a decent game in a while. But no, he had to rub salt in the wound as he took over the map and surrounded my base.  Some people are nice and say stuff like ""gg wp"" at the end. Others just can't win without being a complete asshole about it. But that's just how it always is with games. To be honest, the CoH2 community on the whole is not that bad.  I play a lot of shooters, and people there tend to be way more toxic."

CompanyOfHeroes,39fr4t,thefonztm,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:42:04 2015 UTC,"What RTS games have you played/liked. What factions in those games?    Rough breakdown...  USF - Mobile, agressive. Demands more micro, and it pays off. Well rounded teching, not too dependent on commanders. No ""tanky"" tanks. Substitute having 1 unit eat lots of shots with several units eating a few each. The micro can be a pain, but when you've got the hang of it... It's awesome. Having good timing and planning is important for all factions, but especially USF imo. Keeping a sherman hidden out of sight while you bait a puma with your stuart... HNNNGGG. ;)  Soviet - Various was to play. Teching is typically split T1 or T2 and T3 or T4. Commander selection is important. Can be used to fill gaps in teching or go for special units. Gap filling, EX: Select Guards motor coordination. Go T2 for MGs and mortars, call in guards infantry. Later, go T4 to build SU-85 tank destroyers and call in T-34-85's for tanks.  Whermact/Ostheer - Simple, linear teching. T1 and T2 will give you very solid support into T3 or T4. Tiger commanders are popular, and not a bad choice. Just don't think it's invincible. T1 gives you everything you need for a balanced open. T2 is your AT and supplemental infantry. IMO a HT is always a good buy. Keep it back and alive. Use it to support and reinforce grens.  OKW - Limited units. A faction of specialists..... and volksgrenadiers.... Mobile HQs are nice. Best to opt for safe placement. Behind shot blockers is important, and watch out for arty. Specifically if you see a soviet play with 120mm mortars in one  or more commanders. Don't place too far forward. Unit wise, preservation is critical. You get the best veterancy, and the most. But your squads are small and expensive to reinforce, losing them is really bad. Vehicles likewise.  Game modes  1v1 - USF probably strongest, but balance is alright.  2v2 - Soviet, people say I think. Having a partner allows more specialization and is interesting. Especially a regular partner.  3v3 - Dunno, Wher or OKW. Large games favor axis, especially as the game goes longer.  4v4 Wher or OKW again."
CompanyOfHeroes,39fr4t,gokkel,3,Fri Jun 12 12:34:50 2015 UTC,"Depends what faction you want to play. WFA gives OKW and America, the other gives Wehrmacht and Soviets. WFA factions can also be bought individually. If you dont know which one yet, watch some streams or  Videos."

Being able to place mines and whatnot makes them pretty useful.  In 4v4s this commander can be fairly useful with spy network and mark target.  Their reinforcement cost should be looked at.  It is too damn high, like 34 a model or something.  Their accuracy also really sucks from my personal observations.  I also wish random equipment spawning wasn't a thing.  You either get a super useful mg42 squad, SVTs or useless PPSH partisans.  For all commanders I wish they would make sub-abilities for these call ins so you could pay more or less for better or worse instead of it being random.  I suppose reinforcing them with conscripts could work but that is unnecessary micro.  EDIT: I guess you can't merge with partisans, wtf"

CompanyOfHeroes,39c7nr,nickbass95,3,Wed Jun 10 22:58:20 2015 UTC,"Recently, I've been experimenting with a very high risk USF strategy. Basically, this is how it goes:  Assault Engis, 3x Rifles, Lieutenant, Double AA halftracks, Sherman or Wolverine  In the mid-game, only 2 units are a threat to an AA halftrack, the STUG-E and Puma. A single AA halftrack can beat a puma if it's flak cannon shoots on it first, so 2 can usually beat it. The STUG-E comes out at 6 CPs, and the Wolverine comes out at 7 CPs, so if you can hold out for one CP, you should be good. Otherwise, you should be able to brute force any paks/raketens/shreks/222s.  The strategy is meant to end the game within 15 minutes, baserushing and wiping as much as possible with the wolverine to fill the role emergency stop-gap AT.  Later on, you can rely purely on this commander for armor, and get out a major down the line if they manage to get to heavy armor in order to get out a jackson, or maybe a captain for at guns.  Also, I personally lay the light at-mines EVERYWHERE. On particularly important chokepoints, I'll cluster a bunch of them and place a demo on top of them. It's an auto wipe, and can do some real damage to a tank. Otherwise, I get bars.  It's also important, if you're AA halftrack push works well, bring up all you're infantry and ambulance close and keep up the pressure."

Add 3 cons in heavy cover around it. And early game is yours. They cannot leave their base so all the fuel is yours. Your parter should get 120mm or guards and it's gg.

So, above the set difficulty/start new button, theres a large photo/info box. RIGHT ABOVE THAT is the list of missions you have completed. I had difficulty saving IN-MISSION however the game will be saved from a mission to mission basis. Its interesting how they made it different from save design in Ardennes Assault. They may have switched it because people found it initially confusing/frustrating.   Personally, once you finish Ardennes, its hard to go back to the original campaign. The ""grandstrategy"" chessboard elements were neat, even if a bit superficial (It would have been cooler if you could see the german platoons/battlions counterattack or anticipate your moves. I understand it was made so it created a non-linear campaign. but it could have been so much better :P). The fact that your company strength/veterency carried over between missions made is so much more gripping because I felt I had invested more in my men, and it hurt more when I lost them. With the soviets, it just felt like a meat grinder and I didn't care much for the men I was commanding, there was no emotional attachment."
CompanyOfHeroes,39camm,Chucklesz,2,Thu Jun 11 03:13:55 2015 UTC,The fact that it felt like a meat grinder with little regard to your troops' lives is pretty accurate to the actual Soviet war experience.

The tab at the top (where the missions would be) is always only the first mission.  If I start a new campaign, wait through all the out-of-game and in-game cinematics and then quit, it takes me to this same menu BUT now there are all my previously done missions and on the Left hand side is the Load button.  Every time I start the game however, this menu screen is like as if I have never played the campaign at all yet.  It is so damn frustrating to start the campaign over every time to get to where I was before...  I've tried verifying files with Steam, and it all checks out.  Not sure what I'm doing wrong."

CompanyOfHeroes,39apjw,Hy3RiD,2,Wed Jun 10 16:29:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's the right mission.  Here's how the map looks: http://i.imgur.com/r3XZmdh.png.  I generally defend like this: http://i.imgur.com/xlCEIrx.png, where the green is wire/sandbags to funnel the Germans, and then at 1/2/3 I have an airborne squad with a 57mm and then either an MG nest or squad. Three mortar crews and a few flamer engineers as well.  The Germans drop lots of artillery on the ends of the bridges, so that's why I back up a little. Also easier to defend a shorter line and have overlapping 57s and mortars.  It's a 15 minute defense, and with ~6 minutes remaining there's a ""everyone fall back to the Church!!"" message so I play along and fall back for the final defense."
CompanyOfHeroes,39apjw,thefonztm,6,Wed Jun 10 16:43:55 2015 UTC,I think I got it by pushing out and setting up where the germans spawn. Kill em faster that way so more respawn inside the time limit.

Their diameters are 8.8cm and 5.7cm respectively (iirc), and with the shaped charge they used, the greater the diameter the greater the penetration."
CompanyOfHeroes,394d31,basedyonder,16,Tue Jun 9 04:20:33 2015 UTC,"In late 1942, numbers of early-production American M1 bazookas were captured by German troops from Russian forces who had been given quantities of the bazooka under Lend-Lease as well as during the Operation Torch invasions in the North African Campaign.[2] The Germans promptly developed their own version of the weapon, increasing the diameter of the warhead from 60 mm to 88 mm (2.4 to 3.5 in). In German service, the bazooka was popularly known as the Panzerschreck. The German weapon, with its larger, more powerful warhead, had significantly greater armor penetration; ironically, calls for a larger-diameter warhead had also been raised by some ordnance officers during U.S. trials of the M1, but were rejected. After participating in an armor penetration test involving a German Panther tank using both the Raketenpanzerbüchse, or RPzB 54 Panzerschreck and the U.S. M9 bazooka, Corporal Donald E. Lewis of the U.S. Army informed his superiors that the Panzerschreck was ""far superior to the American bazooka"": ‘I was so favorably impressed [by the Panzerschreck] I was ready to take after the Krauts with their own weapon.[19]’   Fun fact taken from Wikipedia."
CompanyOfHeroes,394d31,Moskau50,17,Tue Jun 9 10:11:10 2015 UTC,"The other interesting bit is that, after the war, the US continued developing the bazooka. The M20 Super Bazooka had a warhead diameter of... wait for it... 88 mm."

So lightly armored on the sides in fact that you have stories like a T-70 taking out two Panthers  But from what I understand it was meant to give infantry a chance at taking out the pretty heavily armored soviet tanks such as the T-34, KV series, and IS series"
CompanyOfHeroes,394d31,Mandarion,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:07:16 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, neither were very effective. Panzerfausts were king on the battlefield."
CompanyOfHeroes,394d31,CherrySlurpee,9,Tue Jun 9 06:52:16 2015 UTC,"The Panzerfaust had the advantage of being more mobile, but it was a single use weapon (just like its predecessor, the Faustpatrone). And it's range was significantly lower, if you ever had to run up to a tank (150m) you know why that was a problem.  The true kings of the battlefield was still artillery. AT guns killed more tanks than any other weapon, field guns killed more infantry than any other weapon."
CompanyOfHeroes,394d31,Mandarion,3,Tue Jun 9 08:41:53 2015 UTC,"I should have said king of handheld/shoulder mounted.   As I understood the shrek was unwieldy and difficult to use. The faust could be used by just about any soldier and was fire-and-drop, and could be carried in a pack."
CompanyOfHeroes,394d31,ZarnoLite,5,Tue Jun 9 08:46:31 2015 UTC,"But with the Panzerschreck you had less to carry when carrying multiple rockets than you had with multiple Panzerfäuste. And as I already wrote, the effective range of the Panzerschreck was quite a bit higher. The Panzerfaust on the other hand was much cheaper, meaning more troops could be equipped with it.  It's kind of similar to modern grenade launchers: There are under-barrel grenade launchers like the M203 and there are separate launchers like the HK69.

An MG + rifle (AT gun if you have/need) will do well enough to stall all but a well executed attack. Even just a few units flanking or cutting off for you ally will be a major boon.  Also, evaluate your opponents. Are they doubleing your ally? Maybe they don't give a damn about the munitions point you are covering and are doubling hard for fuel.  As USF, this is sage advice:   I don't want to get any messages saying, ""I am holding my position."" We are not holding a Goddamned thing. Let the Germans do that. We are advancing constantly and we are not interested in holding onto anything, except the enemy's balls. We are going to twist his balls and kick the living shit out of him all of the time. Our basic plan of operation is to advance and to keep on advancing regardless of whether we have to go over, under, or through the enemy.

CompanyOfHeroes,396405,F1SH_T4C0,3,Wed Jun 10 09:47:28 2015 UTC,I think the biggest failing of many players including myself from time to time is that the territory you managed to liberate isn't always with defending tooth and nail.  For me when I have pushed the enemy back so far I usually have them quite dominated so they don't have much strength. So instead of mounting a grand defence I either completely abandon that area or spread out my units to give me the most amount of sight for the area.  And you should be paying attention to what your teammates are struggling against and send only the unit that counters it. Here you need good micro because you need to be paying attention to your units at your old position and microing your supporting unit or units.  Alternatively an all out bum rush to the side of an enemy attack usually results in win if done intelligently.  If playing against okw go deep flank and find a building to poke. That will draw attention away from your teammates quickly.  And there is always the handy back cap with a random squad.  Wasting manpower and resources on rear echelon and fighting position defence should be put towards staying mobile or increasing your firepower.
CompanyOfHeroes,396405,Contaminator,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:20:52 2015 UTC,"In further of this, if we're dominating the enemy within the first ten minutes I will often abandon enemy side points that I have harass capped, to form a defensive line in the middle of the map. Solely to give the enemy some breathing room so the game isn't over and done with and I want a halfway lengthy game. Their loss if they're foolish enough to ignore how far I've pushed into their domain because they''re focused on doubling an ally.  Then, as others have said, I'll have RE building wire/tank trap/mine devices, an MG or token defence force, then go help my ally."
CompanyOfHeroes,396405,RustyNumbat,3,Wed Jun 10 10:53:16 2015 UTC,"Dropping a mine or two and leaving some token defense as /u/thefonztm suggests is a great idea.  You'll probably be able to flank down and support your team (map dependent of course) or, if you're feeling blitzkrieg-y, go for cut-offs.  I know my biggest mistakes as Allies is not being mobile enough and not re-positioning based on where pressure is being applied."
CompanyOfHeroes,396405,Ph0Mai,2,Wed Jun 10 03:35:32 2015 UTC,"If it's the stage of the game where you have armor, tanks are really good for this. They're fast and they hit hard, and they can easily return to your regular line if they need to. Clearly you have to worry about enemy AT, but between my friends and I, words like ""I'm sending two tanks"" or ""Panther coming to support"" are frequently thrown around. It takes a lot more effort to move your infantry around than it does tanks - although halftracks and scout cars can aid in this process a bit. Your infantry can follow your tanks there if you think you'll need the extra firepower, but the tanks will always get there first. I think Shermans are particularly good for this because they can counter anything with the right ammo, they can provide smoke support, and the crew can repair a critical if you hit a mine on the way there."

All it takes is one fell swoop from both of your opponents against lonely you and you're off the field. Or worse, you lose squads and weapons in the process. In lieu of any voice communications, I recommend referring to the tactical map and get a sense for the posture you're ally is in. Support him, run a flank guard, push and hold with him, anything. You're better off solidly locking down a side of the map then being divided and subsequently conquered. If you lose in your ""lane"" then nothing is stopping your opponent from supporting his teammate and doubling up against your ally. Suddenly neither of you have control of the map or any resources, and you're both fucked."

CompanyOfHeroes,396trv,PenitentAnomaly,5,Tue Jun 9 17:54:17 2015 UTC,"First- never attack the kubel unless you know you can knock it out. Always focus on the sturm pioneers. Once he is down to two models he is in trouble.   Second- keep your troops well separated. This helps fighting both the kubel and the sturms. Ideally you have one squad absorbing supression, while another flanks the kubel or focus fires sturms, and the last is leading the sturms on a wild goose chase"
CompanyOfHeroes,396trv,F1SH_T4C0,4,Tue Jun 9 18:03:03 2015 UTC,What I see a lot of OKW players do these days is set up the first kubel over looking one of the SU players early cap points. Scripts or Engineers get suppressed very quickly and then Sturms move in for the kill with impunity. I guess I need to work more on spreading out the troops or waiting until I have two script squads before I advance.
CompanyOfHeroes,396trv,Katter,2,Tue Jun 9 19:43:03 2015 UTC,"What you have described is exactly the right OKW tactic. And countering it can be hard. If you can retreat a bit before the Kubel gains its suppression, you can try and meet up with another squad. Even 2 conscripts can lay down enough fire to hurt the Sturm, especially if you can get them in heavy cover where it will take a long time to suppress them. If you get the Kubel chasing you, he can't suppress, and often this can lead to situations where you can ambush him."
CompanyOfHeroes,396trv,F1SH_T4C0,2,Wed Jun 10 05:42:43 2015 UTC,"^ very good point.   Use your other senses as well.

I build one script and then a penal and by that time it's a great time for the scout car.

The sniper and scout car counter everything they get out before they tech up in a very serious way. You just avoid the kubel till you get the SC out and then you rake em down and try not to run into a rakten.
CompanyOfHeroes,396trv,LintGrazOr8,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:34:28 2015 UTC,"A T0 start for an extra conscript can work. A kubel cannot take an attack from multiple angles and the sturm pio must stay close to the kubel to both repair it and to take advantage of the suppression. They are very weak to dispersed spam, conscripts are not too shabby against his early volks either.   You can play a USF-like aggressive flanking game. And you've got your fuel in the bank to retreat an engie and get T2 when you need mgs to hold all the ground you've grabbed."

I still like the double cons with molotovs. Wait for sturms to assault their molotov in their path. Then push the kubel with the other squad. If sturms back off the other squad switch for so both cons are shooting the kubal. It will pull back to repair. Wait a few seconds then go around the sides of the expected approach you would take. Normally the shortest rout and focus the sturms while they repair. They drop like flies. Then pummel the kubal to death or it drives away.

CompanyOfHeroes,3962yy,Whinito,5,Tue Jun 9 14:56:28 2015 UTC,"Coh 1 and all the expansions are quite enjoyable. The mechanics are quite sound.  They are a development from dawn of war but polished a bit more bringing them into a very satisfying place. The single player campaign is quite nice and the expansions though smaller and shorter still provide an enjoyable experience.  The graphics can't and won't compete with any recent releases but they still look very very nice with max settings.  As for CoH2:  The mechanics are further polished taking out most of the odd or less than desirable things from coh1. They also injected a couple odd things but nothing serious, that's what you get with progress. The campaign is reasonably satisfying, playing more like a movie. Though where I think the game shines is the expansion. Ardennes assault takes all the nice polished storyline aspect and chucks it out the door. Instead you control three companies in the battle of the bulge and play a pseudo turn based strategy game style to direct where your companies attack then you play this battles out in a variety of different battle grounds with different objectives. And each play through is different as almost every variable available is randomized offering great replay diversity.  As for the nature of the game... I'm not sure if it's less hectic than age of empires... maybe in a different and better way it is as hectic but don't expect either coh1 or 2 to be a leisurely pace game."

Still I find micromanagement impossible. Compare this to TW which separates the tctical battle component from the strategic world, with more slowpaced and tactical battles.

CompanyOfHeroes,394u5h,SanDiegoBurrito,11,Tue Jun 9 07:10:03 2015 UTC,"There's a big disparity in perceived balance depending of the skill level of the players involved.   It is often argued (and I'd agree) that Soviets are the strongest faction at the moment in 1v1 and 2v2 (Double Soviets being the strongest team comp). This, however, is only actually true at higher levels where the players make use of all the tools at their disposition. You'll see that lower skill players will often feel that Axis have an unfair advantage over Allies.  The reason for this is that Allies favor maneuverability and aggressiveness; while they are riskier and have a higher skill ceiling, they offer higher rewards for those who master the faction. In contrast, Axis have, in theory, stronger units (particularly armor) when compared to their Allies' counterparts but, in return, they are more static and slower. This means Axis players have less room for ""making things happen"".  Balance also fluctuates with game mode, I'd argue that the most balanced game mode for competitive gameplay is 1v1. All the things I said previously apply to this game mode. I'd also give an honourable mention to the up and coming 2v2 scene, I'm still not completely sold into the whole competitive 2v2 thing but it looks promising. The other game modes, 3v3 and 4v4, are complete anarchy. Axis are king in these chaotic game modes because there isn't as much room to maneuver as in 1v1 or 2v2, so their stronger units get into frontal engagements more often, favoring them.   So are the factions pretty even now for 1v1, or is OKW or USF considered OP?   Neither USF or OKW are considered OP. In fact, OKW is most likely underpowered in 1v1 in this current patch.  Edit: words  Edit: words again"
CompanyOfHeroes,394u5h,basedyonder,4,Tue Jun 9 09:56:41 2015 UTC,"And the T34-85 is the best medium tank.   I think that title goes to the Panther. T-34/85s are really good, though. The E8s are also pretty good, if there's any doubt (Also, that's why I said ""in theory"").   And the only thing that can go head to head with an IS2 is a KT.   And the Tiger. And the Panther."
CompanyOfHeroes,394u5h,basedyonder,2,Tue Jun 9 13:30:11 2015 UTC,"No. IS2 has same armor as KT.   Rather, the KT was nerfed and now has the same armor as the IS2.   An IS2 can pull the same stunts that a KT used to be able to, like driving up to a pak wall and taking little to no damage.   Hell no. Especially not against Pak 40s (target weak point is a thing). The KT used to be able to do that because it had 425 armor back in the day. You should also take in consideration the Zis-3 has lower pen than the Pak 40.   combined with its mobility the IS2 is by far the best tank in the game except for the TA.   I don't know if I'd call it the best tank in the game but it certainly is a powerful unit. I'd still prefer having two T-34/85s rather than a single IS-2.   I realize it is called a medium tank IRL and in game, but for all purposes in game, it is a heavy tank destroyer like the SU-85 with more mobility and armor. (and a higher cost to even it out).    It isn't a tank destroyer, though. Its main gun has bad anti-infantry capabilities but for all intents and purposes it works like a tank thanks to its 3 MGs. Just like the Sherman is a medium tank much better suited to kill infantry, the Panther is a medium tank better suited to kill armor and both can switch roles if needed, albeit not as effectively as their main role. In comparison, actual tank destroyers perform extremely poorly against infantry. Good luck trying to kill infantry using the SU-85, Elefant or Jagdpanzer.   Not to mention that Ost T4 is pretty rare in 1v1 whereas T34-85s are easily available   I agree, that's also one of the reasons why Axis has an advantage in bigger games, as late game units see a lot more play in those game modes.   But then again, I am bitter over how well CAS, Elite Troops, IS2, Stug-E, and Guard Motor perform. I really think call ins are too common and tend to overperform relative to their cost.   I agree with everything except about Elite Troops. It isn't even that good and the Tiger Ace is mostly a crutch/last resort. Its drawback is just too big for my tastes.   I know some of it is being fixed in this upcoming patch, and I am not sure how to fix Tiger Ace, but I believe CAS could be fixed by replacing munitions transfer with the luftwaffe supply airdrop. That way you couldn't ""Oh I need a strafe right now!"".   I don't have much to comment about that but I certainly don't agree with most of it. It's your opinion, though.   IS2 just needs a nerf overall, it is unstoppable   It isn't.   It has gotten to the point where if I just immediately go Elite Troops or Guard Motor because they are such brainless doctrines.    Funnily enough, if you watched one of the latest SCK's casts, you'd know Elite Troops hardly ever wins against serious competition. Guard Motor is too good, though, I agree on that.   I try new things or go non meta, but sometimes I don't want to have to think when I know my opponent doesn't.   Well, it sounds like you aren't enjoying yourself, which is pretty much the whole point of playing a game."
CompanyOfHeroes,394u5h,basedyonder,2,Tue Jun 9 13:52:38 2015 UTC,Both call ins tanks you described. The only tank that can take out an is2 is literally everything if you can outnumber it. Two p4s can take out an is2 if you are smart and both can survive. The is2s have slow turret rotation and most soviets don't follow up with Zis unless they are smart. Germans also have the best at gun and the best rocket launcher. They maintain armor superiority but that doesn't mean the tanks are any better if you get what I mean. However in 3v3s and upward the bigger the tank faster the better because you have 3 other players to back you up. If super heavies were disabled like kt-tiger-is2 the game would be way more diverse in 3v3 and 4v4. The maps feel just too small a lot of the time and super heavy spamming is always the endgame.

The Cromwell tank, named after the English Civil War leader Oliver Cromwell, was the first tank put into service by the British to combine a dual-purpose gun, high speed from the powerful and reliable Meteor engine, and reasonable armour, in a balanced package. Its design formed the basis of the Comet tank.  The Cromwell and Centaur differed in the engine used. While the Centaur had the Liberty engine of the predecessor cruiser tank, the Crusader (and the interim A24 Cavalier), the Cromwell had the significantly more powerful Meteor. Apart from the engine and associated transmission differences, the two tanks were the same and many Centaurs built were fitted with the Meteor to make them Cromwells.  The Cromwell first saw action in the Battle of Normandy in June 1944. The tank equipped the armoured reconnaissance regiments, of the Royal Armoured Corps, within the 7th, 11th and Guards Armoured Divisions. While the armoured regiments of the latter two divisions were equipped with M4 Shermans, the armoured regiments of the 7th Armoured Division were equipped with Cromwell tanks. The Centaurs were not used in combat except for those fitted with a 95mm howitzer, which were used in support of the Royal Marines during the invasion of Normandy.

CompanyOfHeroes,38yq9t,redditors_r_manginas,5,Sun Jun 7 23:49:06 2015 UTC,"The problem with blobbing in a series like CoH, and in a game like CoH2 especially, is it drastically decreases the ways in which a player can differentiate himself from others. CoH2's gameplay, relative to other strategy games and even relative to CoH1, is heavily skewed toward micro. There are very little strategic options beyond which units to build next, and the vast majority of player-differentiating skill comes from how well those units you produce are utilized.  When you have a game that revolves entirely around unit control and then you reward lazy, low-skill unit control (which blobbing is) as much as or even more than skillful, considered play, you undermine the one avenue players have to display their skill. If, for example, you have two players with vastly different micro abilities, there is no way for the more-skilled player to display his skill if easy-to-execute strategies are as powerful as difficult-to-execute ones. Not saying this is the case in CoH2 right now, but it's the basis for the argument that blobbing is bad for gameplay in a micro-focused title.  In Starcraft, for instance, blobbing is far less of an issue because there are so many other ways to differentiate yourself as a player. In Starcraft, you learn mechanics, macro, strategic timings, and economy management before you even begin to consider unit control seriously; in CoH2, unit control is the first and most important aspect of the game to master.  When it comes to strategy games, a major factor in design is rewarding skillful play. A micro-focused game needs to reward good micro. Blobbing will always exist, but it needs to be less rewarding than proper unit control and positioning."
CompanyOfHeroes,38yq9t,InverseTV,3,Mon Jun 8 16:14:15 2015 UTC,"So how do you punish blobbing without introducing a way for lone squads to be obliterated in the blink of an eye?  Because there is nothing more anti-fun than a squad wipe that happens when you aren't watching, and the easiest way to always be watching is to have all your units in one place.  Or maybe they improve AoE suppression?  That brings the potential issue of reducing map movement by encouraging unassailable static hard points where MGs are king.  Its not an easy one.   Any ideas?"
CompanyOfHeroes,38yq9t,s2secretsgg,2,Mon Jun 8 16:52:04 2015 UTC,"CoH1 managed to do it with a combination of mines, suppression, artillery, and increased accuracy against units in groups. Even then, it took a while to iron out, and they still struggled with niche strategies like Piospam being very powerful for very long. It's not easy, but it's essential when micro is the core mechanic your game revolves around.  Blobs will always be strong because of simple math, the key is to make blobbing excessively risky. Suppression from MGs and mines that waste large amounts of time, for instance, or artillery that punishes unit groups. One big problem CoH2 has is the lack of information gathering thanks to the addition of true sight and the removal of primary scouting units like Jeeps and bikes. This is an indirect nerf to positional weapons like MGs and mortars because it gives players less time to prepare for blobs in advance. An MG is useless if it's not facing the right direction, and without scouting you're just flipping a coin and hoping your opponent walks into you.  Furthermore, as long as you're given proper audio and visual cues, I don't have a problem with abilities that have the potential to completely wipe squads if you're too slow to respond. CoH has always been a low-unit-count franchise, and there's really no excuse for not reacting in time to artillery and similar abilities provided proper cues are provided to you. At that point it turns into a question of skill and reaction time, which is good for the game."
CompanyOfHeroes,38yq9t,InverseTV,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:08:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with the squad wipe abilities- My point was that they exist at the moment, and blobs are a thing, but if you buffed the cast-time or power, it becomes just as good against lone squads.  As you say, with proper 'tells', they are fine.   I just think all the counters have the potential to be be very anti fun if they are not tuned just right."
CompanyOfHeroes,38yq9t,s2secretsgg,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:44:10 2015 UTC,"I haven't played CoH2 enough to advocate for any specific solution. I just know from experience that the key to managing blobs, at least in CoH1, was a combination of having the tools necessary to defeat them and having the information necessary to know which of those tools will be most effective and where. When I played CoH2, the combination of more restrictive vision and the removal of key scouting units made gathering necessary information impractical, and at times impossible. Having the correct tools available doesn't do you any good when you don't know you need those tools until it's too late."

CompanyOfHeroes,38xtqu,multihsmaster,8,Sun Jun 7 19:34:21 2015 UTC,"With Soviet, people generally decide between Tier 1 or 2, and then between tier 3 or 4. You want to be teching up as soon as you have the fuel to do so, unless you really really need some other unit immediately.   With OKW, if you're getting the medic truck, get it as soon as you're able. If you're getting the repair/vehicle truck, you can wait until you have a bit more fuel since you'll need fuel to build anything from that truck.  For a Soviet opening, I would just aim for a good mix of units. It obviously depends which tier you go for, but the scout car with penals (with flamethrowers), or a mix of MGs, and Mortars, with a few conscripts is generally good. For OKW, I generally go Volk>Kubel>Volk and then usually get the med truck somewhere easy to defend but still close enough to the battle to be useful. If you're doing well, get the forward retreat point to keep the pressure up.  I'm not sure what you mean by the last question (it's been a while since I played SC2). You can use Ctrl+any number to set a group of units to that hotkey. Then you can use tab to cycle through any units you have selected."
CompanyOfHeroes,38xtqu,Katter,0,Sun Jun 7 19:51:05 2015 UTC,"This is a better-written version of what I was going to say.  I will add that with OKW, the first truck you place should be chosen and positioned based on your expected strategic needs. I typically place the medic truck 3/4 of the way to the middle of a map, because it can be upgraded to function as a retreat point. It will then serve as a forward HQ, healing your units and reinforcing them only a short distance from the front line. It's safer than you might think; if it comes under attack, reinforcements can be quickly summoned there by retreating.  In theory, the medic truck is the better of the two. In practice, I get far more mileage out of the mechanized truck. That truck should be placed in an open or otherwise easily accessible area away from the front line, since it'll be the rally point for damaged vehicles to come in for repair. The flak truck it offers works like a beefier version of the kubelwagen, you can use it to hold choke points and halt infantry advances. Like the kubel and other LMG/light armor units, you don't want to leave the flak truck alone, but it doesn't need much help to wipe squads and hold ground. It's a very valuable unit for setting up a strong defensive line that will keep the allies out of your territory or push them further back into their own. The Puma is pretty much single-handedly the reason I skip the medic truck. It's fast, it's armored, it hits the field early, and it'll wreck anything short of a proper tank. You can harass infantry squads all over the place, preventing them from capturing your distant territories. Even when tanks start rolling out, the Puma is to most Allied armor what the Sherman is to most German armor. You want to zip around hunting for rear armor hits and supporting any medium or heavy tanks you produce. Technically it's a little better when you get it from Mobile Defense Doctrine, since that version can use smoke canisters, but it's almost always one of my first vehicles on the field when playing OKW. Whether it's soviet scout cars or any US armor short of a sherman, the Puma can handle it.  My general OKW strategy is to build a few Sturmpioneers and use them to capture territory and assault the enemy until I can get my mechanized truck built. Once that's done, I'll make the call between a flak truck and the Puma, depending on whether or not I've seen any armor. If they're pumping out infantry or otherwise skipping light vehicles, I'll grab a flak truck first and only buy a Puma if vehicles start causing me problems before my second halftrack arrives.  That second halftrack always becomes the tank truck with the AA gun on the back. I try not to set it on the front lines, but I always put it in a position to actively block off infantry routes. If I have a flak truck, I'll pick the two most heavily-traveled paths and put the halftrack on one and the flak truck on the other. If I've got one central point that I absolutely must not lose, I'll set the halftrack there and place the flak truck with an overlapping field of fire.  I don't generally have the time or the resources to build the medic truck. By the time the third supply halftrack arrives, I'm generally well into my end-game advance or the enemy is at the gates and the building isn't going to do me any good. Those resources are typically better spent on Obersoldaten, Fallschirmjagers (if you have them) and tanks.  EDIT: Fuck, fine, I'll remove the bits about Sturmpioneers. DOES MY OPINION MEET YOUR STANDARDS NOW, REDDIT!?"
CompanyOfHeroes,38xtqu,Fixer951,14,Sun Jun 7 23:05:03 2015 UTC,Sturmpioneers are such versatile units that I don't often bother with volks unless I need panzerschreks.   Oh god OP don't listen to this part.

CompanyOfHeroes,38xtqu,redditors_r_manginas,3,Sun Jun 7 22:25:06 2015 UTC,I did so a while ago too. Soviet's felt like the best option as they were good in large numbers and i found that having a large number of units pushing at different places on the map constantly suits my playstyle more than the defensive oriented OKW or Wehrmacht.  I usually spam conscripts until i have the fuel to tech to t34's then i use them with my infantry and try to flank the enemy and surround them or cut of sections of the map with overwhelming numbers to starve the axis forces before they get tanks at which point i have enough t34's to overwhelm enemy superior tanks or can hold out until the game ends.
CompanyOfHeroes,38xtqu,Vharii,2,Mon Jun 8 03:20:43 2015 UTC,"Not wanting to sound derogative, but this often seems to come from former SC2 players. In CoH you are (for the most part) much more free in what you can and what you should get in terms of units. Unlike SC2, where a build limits you to specific units (because otherwise your resource efficiency would collapse), you can and actually should go for a combined arms strategy.   The scissor-stone-paper principle in CoH is much less visible, because those roles are not as extreme here (and in fact there are only two important roles: Anti-Infantry or Anti-Vehicle). Only few units are dedicated to a single role (with units like the Obersoldaten, or any tank-destroyer being the notable exclusion). In other words: Get that mortar, use that MG - and especially as a Soviet player: USE THE MINE!"

CompanyOfHeroes,38xtqu,KrazeeEyesKilla,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:17:40 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. adding on to Krazee, denying resources and strategic points to an axis player is a must and will take priority over everything else. Axis late game usually outperforms all allied forces late game and you want to hold them back from it as long as possible. Because most Soviet buildings require a decent chunk of fuel to build and late game vehicles take up a decent amount of fuel as well so waiting to get them usually isnt a problem. Sometimes even in 1's ill wait till like 200 fuel before dropping even T3-4. Same can be said for T1-2, usually you get those for support not the core of your army so again waiting to get them wont hurt you."

Then I have my engineers build fuel caches and build either T3 or T4 depending upon enemy units / my commanders call-ins.  For instance, if I have a commander with good tanks (IS2/T34-85), I will build for Katyushas.

Can't send in your tanks due to their tanks? Well, your AT gun has the higher range, use the focus-sight ability and go. 3 PzGrens with Schrecks means he spent 360 Munition on his troops, that means his Grens are missing out on LMGs and thus are worse than your baseline infantry."

CompanyOfHeroes,38ygfi,ZarnoLite,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:40:35 2015 UTC,Lead with your infantry. Shreks have a long reload time so if you can get them to waste a round your shermans can mop them up with HE rounds before they can fire back
CompanyOfHeroes,38ygfi,hitlerslittlehelper,3,Tue Jun 9 00:54:27 2015 UTC,"Always always always keep jacksons way in the back screened by infantry. They have one of the longest ranges in the game (or the best, don't remember) and work well only there's squads out front spotting and covering it. Anytime anything even starts advancing towards your jackson you back that thing up."
CompanyOfHeroes,38ygfi,nicksam112,2,Mon Jun 8 00:39:25 2015 UTC,As US the biggest thing against pgrens is don't assault them with other assault infantry. With airborne give them lmg upgrade and stay at range. This forces them to either close distance or pull back. Just kite with them until you can get an m8 scott and boom you have countered pgrens.  Just slap a jackson nearby to support when armor shows up and you are good.  Thompsons are good but they just don't cut it against pgrens.
CompanyOfHeroes,38ygfi,Contaminator,2,Sun Jun 7 23:03:11 2015 UTC,don't assault them with other assault infantry   why? OP is having trouble with PG with schreks. PG lose half their anti infantry capability when they get schreks. Even a Riflemen squad would be able to go toe to toe with them.
CompanyOfHeroes,38ygfi,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:44:16 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken they have the best mid/close range damage in the entire game. Two of the models alone have more dps than a while vanilla conscript squad. So if you blob two or more together not only do they have sufficient AI they have two schreks each. A smart player doesn't give every squad the schrek upgrade. It's expensive and it's better to have a blend of all the squad wiping dps of a pgren and have a squad or two schreks. With the accuracy and pen schreks have you can volly almost any US vehicle off the map. And the rest of the combined dps of your infantry handles any opposing infantry.  So yes maybe 1v1 with nothing else going on a rifleman squad and a schrek pgren is about even but OP talks about blobs and US has no reliable blob punishment tools. The closest is the m8 scott (or dozer sherman) which can gimp squads reasonably well, but does require micro.  Also OP asked the question in terms of airborn so I gave him a strategy which should allow him to handle his problem without resorting to a different doctrine than the one he wants to play."

Also it sounds like your problem wasn't so much panzershrecks but rather the enemy fought with combined arms and you didn't. Remember, shrecks are not good against infantry at range.

CompanyOfHeroes,38ygfi,rshunter313,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:39:47 2015 UTC,"Hard to tell without a replay, but you probably should have tried to suppress the blob with an HMG or with the paratrooper lmg ability. While the blob is suppressed, you can easily wipe them with scotts or shermans with HE shells. Shermans might be better, since they can eat a volley (and require less micro). Honestly, with Paras you should always go for at least one lmg and then maybe a thompson since the latter is much more situational. Thompsons don't suck balls if you activate the ability (tactical assault or something along those lines), where their movement speed is decreased but their accuracy and damage goes through the roof. However, that is only useful in close range and can be a liability if a Brummbär is present."

Support weapons can't vault, so you can both use sandbags (they are not just for cover) and barbwire to mold the battlefield.   Stuka/Flak HT or a rush to a P2 are your main gamefinishing answers.

Most the Axis used German equipment, including the Italians, but they at least had their own army and tanks/planes as well.

CompanyOfHeroes,38x2pp,TehBrownSheep,6,Sun Jun 7 16:00:38 2015 UTC,"If they have both, my advice is to avoid engaging them at all.  You can take those forces that you would have thrown into fighting them, and instead spread out and cap their territory. When the units split up, you can take on either the kubel or the sturmpioneers separately. If they don't split up, then the kubel only moves at the speed of the sturmpioneers and neither of them have anything to shoot. They might go around capping your territory, but you can follow them around reclaiming it. If you have at least two infantry squads, you can cap twice as many points as the Kubel/Sturmpios can. That's a bad trade for them, and it only gets worse if they get bogged down trying to chase one of your units around. The more you can tie up those units without engaging them, the better. Once you have grenades, a bazooka, or enough firepower to handle them directly, you can do so at your discretion.  The best thing you could hope for is that they split up. An unsupported Kubel is asking for trouble, and you should be able to take out the sturmpioneers as long as you keep them at arm's length.  If you do have to engage this combination together, keep them mobile and keep them as far away as possible. If you keep falling back, the Kubel won't be able to deploy because it'll keep having to reposition and the sturmpioneers won't be able to close distance. Focus the Kubel first because it'll lock your units down and also because it'll go down faster under focused fire. With the danger of suppression out of the way, you're free to kite the sturmpioneers around or hit them with grenades.  EDIT: The Kubel is faster than your infantry, so ""fall back"" won't work if it overextends in order to trap your guys when it sets up. If/when the Kubel rushes your guys in order to prevent a retreat, you should rush it or flank it so that you're not caught in the FOV when it finishes setting up. That'll either leave you with a stationary target that can't shoot you, or it'll force the Kubel to spin around trying to lock you down. Do what you have to do to get that Kubel taken out, if you have to retreat and try again because the Sturmpioneers caught you or you got pinned, then so be it."
CompanyOfHeroes,38x2pp,Fixer951,2,Sun Jun 7 16:14:32 2015 UTC,"As USF I like to get an extra RE squad to help flank/draw fire. You can use volley fire to suppress the sturms while another unit flanks and harasses the kubel. Early grenade tech is useful too as you can huck one in the path of the advancing Sturms and kill quite a few. Make your priority killing the Sturmpioneers as they can't be repaired for free in the field and are extra vulnerable themselves while repairing.  As USSR, the scout car is a go-to. Maxims will also deal good damage to the kubel and suppress the Sturms."
CompanyOfHeroes,38x2pp,MyCaG,2,Sun Jun 7 18:20:17 2015 UTC,"The best way I have found to handle it is either smoke nades as US or molotovs as Russians.  Use the smoke to negate kubel suppress and flank.  Russians struggle a bit more. It is a tough combo for them. Two con squads are needed. Keep them seperated enough so neither receives area suppression from the other when the kubel fires. Stirmpios usually take the shortest rout to assault these units. Focus fire on the kubel and molotov the sturmpios path. This causes more micro. Player has to dodge flames and keep assaulting or pull back, decide if/ when to move kubel. If you can apply enough damage sturms will rep kubal. Then you focus sturms because they get increased received accuracy when repairing. Your cons go from Ray Louis trying to find waldo to burly, eagle eyed, communist super soldiers who VOLUNTEERED to pink mist some fascist brains. Then kubel is free to be man handled.   However like all early game these are not win buttons and require time to perfect and can be entirely dependent on your opponents skill or lack there of."

You need at least two squads, either double Rifles or Rifle + RE. They can only fire in one direction, so flank the car and force them to disengage. You don't need to kill the Kubel immediately, just get it to back off. This means they will have to spend time fixing it off the field, giving you more map control.  By the time you get heavier weapons (bazookas or light vehicle), the Kubel becomes obsolete."
CompanyOfHeroes,38x2pp,USSZim,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:08:03 2015 UTC,I usually listen for the Kubel in the fog of war before first contact.  I can still hear the crushing but I haven't been hearing the engine lately idk if they changed it or what.

Also going rifle company and getting a veteran squad with rifle nades can help. Just make sure to make Jacksons late game and not spam Easy 8s.
CompanyOfHeroes,38w1d1,TadeKiller,3,Sun Jun 7 08:35:08 2015 UTC,"I was going to get on and fool around with the game anyway, my Steam name is the same as my reddit username. Send me a friend request and we can play a round or two.  If for whatever reason we don't end up playing together, I would recommend dropping down to Easy AI for the time being. Nobody's gonna know, and we've all been there. In addition to knocking down the difficulty at first, I'd suggest that you practice with 2v2s filled with AI when playing by yourself. If need be, set your teammate's AI to a higher setting than the enemy AI so they can kind of carry you as you figure things out.  Part of what you'll need to learn is each faction's tech tree, the specifics of which units come from where and how you unlock the next set. The next part is figuring out what each unit does. As a general rule, every army has:   Basic infantry with some sort of AT option, sometimes grenades ""Engineer"" units, they typically carry SMGs and have the ability to build/repair things ""Special"" infantry, these are your shock troops, your AT rifle troops, your ""elite"" troops. In most cases, the call-in troops or infantry squads that you recruit from a building besides your HQ or starting Infantry Building are going to be tougher, more effective and more expensive than any army's basic infantry. Some of them are better at filling AT roles, some of them are close-range infantry killers. Every single one of these is different; having a basic idea of what abilities each one has and the various roles they fill will help you figure out the enemy's strategy. As a general rule, any squad that isn't ""normal"" infantry probably warrants better cover, positioning and/or numbers before engaging. You'll also want to watch out for grenades, satchel charges, or other abilities because most of these infantry units have something up their sleeve. AT guns LMG and Mortar teams, I'm just going to lump in any weapon with a ""crew"" that isn't specifically an AT gun Halftracks and miscellaneous ""light"" vehicles ""Light"" tanks. That's your Ostwind, Luchs, Stuart, Puma, etc. These are generally good at killing infantry and/or light vehicles but bad at killing tanks. They are pretty much immune to small arms fire (unlike the other light vehicles), but they still blow up quickly when exposed to just about any AT weaponry Medium and Heavy Tanks. These are immune to small arms fire and can take various amounts of AT fire before going down. You'll typically use them to blow up enemy light vehicles, tanks, and most importantly: structures. You'll need them to prevent your base from being destroyed, and you'll need them to destroy the enemy base.   And then finally, you'll just need some practice to put all the pieces together. You'll have to feel out when you need to watch an infantry squad to make sure it doesn't fuck up or get wiped, and when you need to be looking elsewhere to keep units from idling around where they're not needed. The more familiar you are with how a given army works and the roles filled by each unit, the easier it is to shift your attention around the battle at large. Preferred build orders, overall strategies, the basic ability to keep track of everything, that just comes with time and practice playing an army.  So start out small: play super easy matches and then bump up the difficulty by a little bit every time you succeed. You'll be winning 1v1s with the AI and holding your own against more difficult AI in 2v2s soon enough."

CompanyOfHeroes,38vxve,SgtMustang,14,Sun Jun 7 07:43:06 2015 UTC,"The SU-85 is actually quite strong, you just can't use it like a tank because its a tank destroyer. It has an ability that significantly extends its line of sight, meaning that it can fire at tanks from a huge distance without being fired back at (bottom left button on the grid). That means that the way you should use an SU85 is to screen it behind infantry, and let it fire away at tanks at a distance.  AT guns from the tier two building are also effective.  The call in tanks from Guard Motor Coordination (t34/85s) paired with the mark target ability can go toe toe with basically anything.  The IS2 call in tank can go toe to toe with basically anything as well.  If you can mass like 3 or 4 T34/76, you can usually brute force tanks that aren't supported. You should be laying down mines all day as soviets, in places where you can punish a tank if its engine gets damaged.  The most important thing with any of these is to make sure they have support. An IS2 on its own probably won't win. An is2 that has anti tank guns guarding it's flanks, with infantry ahead to scout or maybe throw an at made is much stronger.  You should also try playing as the other faction and look at how they beat you when you're axis."
CompanyOfHeroes,38vxve,halcyon950,3,Sun Jun 7 08:24:07 2015 UTC,"The vision range thing makes sense, I wasn't aware of that.  I've been using the Guard Motor commander so far, so I'll make sure to keep an eye on the T-34/85s next time.  Thanks for the tips!"
CompanyOfHeroes,38vxve,ClaytonIsOnline,2,Sun Jun 7 08:44:59 2015 UTC,"If you are using the Guard Motor Commander, it's also quite common among higher tiered players to only stick to Soviet Tier 2 with support weapons for most of the game to save on fuel. This way, with constant engagements throughout the game, they can call out their T34/85s the moment they are available. This does make playing the mid-game a bit harder though since you are relying on only call-ins as armoured sport though."

CompanyOfHeroes,38vxve,TehTram,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:57:15 2015 UTC,"Also, whenever you only want to attack tanks (ex: with at guns or an su85, which are horrible against infantry) turn on the prioritize vehicle option and leave it on. That prevents them from wasting shots on infantry and giving away their position or getting distracted at all."
CompanyOfHeroes,38vxve,HauntedGrass,3,Sun Jun 7 12:21:10 2015 UTC,"I've always found su-85s to be the best way to deal with German heavy armour, especially once they hit vet 2. Just make sure you use them at max range as they can go down pretty fast. Try and get a flank of with t-34s and always have at guns to support."
CompanyOfHeroes,38vxve,nickbass95,2,Sun Jun 7 08:25:49 2015 UTC,"The thing is, you are supposed to deprive them of fuel as often as you can, so they can't get their epic tanks.   M4C Shermans, T34/85s, or IS-2s supported by SU-85s or AT guns, can take most axis tanks.   King Tigers are slow and have a very slow turret rotation. An unsupported King Tiger is a dead King Tiger. All you have to do it circle around it.   Also, mines! I never see people using mines, not nearly enough. It's much easier to destroy a tank with a damaged engine than one going at full speed."
CompanyOfHeroes,38vxve,c_a_l_m,2,Sun Jun 7 10:24:36 2015 UTC,"I second mines.  The Soviet mine is incredibly versatile and seeing as you tend to float munitions as the Soviets, there's no reason not to lay them down."

If you are behind on fuel or they have a larger army with more vet due to trading favorably with you, Axis will roll over you with their crown jewel tanks.   It's easy to blame the tanks alone when they are the most prominent and quite difficult to kill with your diminished forces but they can be only a highly visible symptom of cumulative small defeats during the early and mid game."

CompanyOfHeroes,38towk,befree4ever,2,Sat Jun 6 19:22:55 2015 UTC,I'm surprised airborne is tier 1 and rifle company is tier 2 for the US.
CompanyOfHeroes,38towk,CptJamesTAsscrack,3,Sat Jun 6 22:40:56 2015 UTC,"The main reason is that the airborne doc allows for much greater flexibility and access to the elite infantry of USF.  The paratroopers scale much much better and are better equipped than the rifles who will taper off in the late game.  During late game play, the rifle company can only provide the easy 8s and a non lethal off map artillery strike.  Airborne can call in the P-47s which speak for  themselves.  I used to think the same as you but after a while it became very evident that while rifle can give you an early game edge and a nice tank, airborne is good at every stage of the game offering great utility and the ability to safely go any tier and cover your mistakes with call-in at/mg, and of course the air support."
CompanyOfHeroes,38towk,Tomakaze,2,Sun Jun 7 04:02:01 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation. I understand now.
CompanyOfHeroes,38towk,CptJamesTAsscrack,1 point,Sun Jun 7 05:27:08 2015 UTC,Fortifications doctrine is the best OKW Commander? When will you ever be able to afford to buy all those fancy mines and defences when buying shrecks and ober LMGs?
CompanyOfHeroes,38towk,dr-pavel,3,Sat Jun 6 20:23:41 2015 UTC,"Fortifications is so good because of the pak43. Unlike Ostheer, OKW has always enough mp to build a pak43. On 1vs1 maps you can screen a huge area with a pak43 and the synergy with a KT is very good.   A KT is vulnerable to flanking, with a pak43 you take away that option. Also for an OKW player its much easier to defend the Pak43, since you can deploy it near your schwere panzer HQ, which protects it from infantry and you can have it near you medic hq, which means you can quickly recrew or reinforce the pak43 when its under attack.   60 muni for a ober lmg is not that much, its just two grenades, I often notice people throw grenades at every fight, which is wrong.   Therefore Obers > Falls. Also the forti doctrine gives you a strong lategame. When you are maxed out with a KT, Stuka etc 100/100 popcap simply switch to munitions transfer and spam mines, bunkers or even zeroing artillery, which will destroy everything in its circle.   Also the most popular allied commander (airborne,   guard motor / shock rifle) don't have off map strikes that can destroy the pak43, shock rifle can decrew with a incendiary strike, but its not a big problem to simply recrew it, especially when your medic truck is nearby."

Advance Warfare, Lend Lease, Soviet Industry, Terror, Shock army, Armored Assault..."
CompanyOfHeroes,38towk,Chukonoku,2,Sun Jun 7 09:29:05 2015 UTC,"The advanced warfare is also very good, especially in team games, you get to warn your teammates every time a light vehicle or a tank is headed towards their lines. If you relay the information well and it is well used by your team, that first ability (radio intercept) is by itself a game changer. Add to that the ppsh upgrade, conscript repairs and the t-34/85, which is very good especially if used in conjuction with su-85 TDs, and you have a commander that can impact the game from minute one to minute 50, which is very valuable.  The sturmovik strafing run is almost always a waste of ammo tho."
CompanyOfHeroes,38towk,MA-V,3,Mon Jun 8 17:27:45 2015 UTC,"Most of the Soviet Commanders are overall very viable and strong. Each ofc, has their different game mode and niche. You won't normally see Soviet Industry in a 1v1 but it can be really strong in team games.  I think the only straight up ""bad"" ones are Armored Assault, Conscript Assault and Defensive Tactics. All the other ones have their strong points.  Armored Assault is just overkill in that you have both the T-34/85 and the IS-2, of which you'll never reliably afford both in normal games. You have nothing but Radio Intercept to help you early game and that's a lot more useful in doctrines all about early-midgame pressure than a lategame all-in style that this one presents.  Conscript Support is all-ove kind of just lackluster. Hit the Dirt is good against HMG spam but is overall extremely situational at best. The Assault Package is outdone by Shock Troops and is found in overall stronger niched doctrines. The Repair Kit is good as a support tool, but again, you have nothing strong to build it around other than T-70s, T-34s and SU-85, all low hp tanks that are repaired pretty quickly anyway. Rapid Conscription could help in munitions transferring but in a doctrine reliant only on Cons you're going to want a lot of mines/molotovs/oorah already so I'd be hesitant to trade munies for MP. I guess it could all work hypothetically with like 5-7 Cons or some insane amount in a larger team game, but I haven't managed.  Defensive Tactics is just bad. The DhSK is decent, but nothing to build your whole doctrine around, and is more reliable as a way to skip T2 and still have an HMG available than anything else. 2 CP mines are unnecessary when the standard TM mines are already really strong. Tank Traps have too low health and take too long to build to reliably block tanks. The M42 and 120mm are both found in better doctrines, where they make more sense. It's like a doctrine built around stationary support gameplay when all you need to do is build T2 and have that available anyway.  Those are just my thoughts on the matter though, feel free to disagree!"

Relic is trying to show the tragedy of eastern front by exaggerating cruelty of Soviet command. Yes - game exaggerates, but to show those things in more ""brutal"" and ""literal"" way. But every of those attrocities are based about real life scenarios. Red Army didn't burn down houses with civilians - at least not on purpose, but after the village was mowed down to the ground, most of the civillians would suffer from starvation. Also, about Polish resistance. It was common that after cooperating with Soviets, the units were invited to the meetings with soviet commanders. Most of the Polish soldiers were then sentenced into gulags, killed or forced into conscripts of Polish puppet army."

I'm not trying to say that there weren't atrcocities, but they weren't without some kind of merit, misguided or not.

The soviets experience massive casualties because Stalin killed most of his experienced commanders during the Great Purge, so the commanders he had when Hitler invaded were mostly shit, now just couple that with poor troop training, the fact that Russia was still undergoing the infrastructural change during Stalin's Collectivization, and (later) sheer desperation. I mean for crying out loud Stalin killed tons of his own men and sentenced TONS of civilians to the gulags where they will spend the rest of their lives being worked to death, its not like the Russia was being ruled by some altruistic saint and the commanders of the Soviet Union were super awesome dudes that did everything they could to protect human lives. And his commanders DID sacrifice their troops due to desperation or stupidity, maybe not as ridiculously as was portrayed in the game, but still, this shit did happen during WWII. People get their panties in a twist for the dumbest shit."

The Soviets had neither the the training nor the tech that Germany had, so they had to employ the harsh tactics demonstrated in the game at times, and massive amounts of Soviet troops paid the price as a result. What I'm saying is that OP's argument is nonsensical because this shit did actually happen due to Stalin's ruthless rule, the game just exaggerates it because its a fucking game. People seem to be bent out of shape over how the Soviets were depicted in the flavor cut scenes for a fucking video game, but that's all coh2 is, a fucking WWII-themed strategy game, not a documentary."

Both of which happen to be under Rommel's command.    You are saying Relic is biased for displaying war crimes that happened on the Eastern Front while not displaying war crimes that didn't happen on the Western Front.

Defeating Germany doesn't wash the Soviet Union's hands of the immeasurable war crimes it committed not only to the rest of Europe, but to Russia itself.

The German military, although a tool in the hands of Hitler and the Nazi Party, wasn't not ""Nazified"" through and through. You can call them Nazis if you want but you'd be completely incorrect. The same way you can't call every American soldier who took part in OIF a Republican because the Bush Administration wanted the war with Iraq. Using the American military to further Bush's aims of foreign policy does not make every single participant complicit with him and a Bush supporting Republican. To claim that you'd have to make the same leap you are making by calling every German soldier a Nazi.   The analogy I'm making is not perfect by any means. But I'm just trying to demonstrate how you simply cannot paint history with such broad strokes and generalizations and be factual. You just can't. Finland, Romania, Hungary, Italy, and others were co-belligerents alongside Germany in WW2. Are they National Socialists too because they had ""no business crossing borders"", as you put it?

Hillary Clinton was all for that and she has a good shot at the presidency.    Also 3/4 of American military members vote Republican.  Generalizing the military as a Republican institution isn't inaccurate.  That would be an understandable label.  Just as how I now label the Wermacht as a Nazi institution.

You can find Wermacht soldiers who were nice guys, I get it.

EDIT: Also it seems to me that there were plenty of bad apples in the Wermacht to fuck over the entire institution.  Your squad can be nice to civilians your entire career but if some other soldier shows up one day and shoots a bunch of them in the face you can guess how your institution will be remembered.

Obviously up close they do nice damage and can force a retreat quicker than non-upgraded cons would.  I wouldn't upgrade all of your cons though.  Yes this upgrade is in a weird spot since shock troops basically do the same thing but with more armor and very useful smoke grenades.  However, if your opponent is spreading out his squads without supporting them having your cons able to Oorah and do big damage to isolated squads is nice.    6 ppshs would be too powerful.  Germans would have no choice but to turtle up more than they already do."

CompanyOfHeroes,38po6u,anon4773,2,Fri Jun 5 20:27:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think so.  Pretty much all units have good point blank accuracy to begin with especially with SMGs so I think any gained accuracy through vet would be moot.    I wouldn't use PPSH cons against elite infantry like that unless you can really get the drop on them like hiding behind a building on them or something.    Another trick that works is have regular cons engage at max range and then oorah in ppsh cons.  Unless your opponent tells the other squad to engage the charging squad they will probably shoot at the further cons.    You just have to engage elite infantry in situations that are advantageous to your cons. Usually this means sandbags, molotovs, and crazy flanking routes to even the odds.  Also if they have a lot of elite inf you should have an anti-infantry vehicle engaging them.  A Katusha, T-34, M5 Krautmower, T-70. Usually a Katusha is the best option."

And I think they get an accuracy buff but I could be making that up.   Either way if you space your squads reasonably well they are terrifying.  I also found they tend to be better defensively or as reaction units. Late game conscripts are just there to be a nuisance. The ppsh upgrade just gives them a little more hold out/last ditch effort value.  So yes shocks are better. They are also a specialty unit designed to assault stuff. Just like at rifle conscripts aren't as good as guards. You just can't compare two things that do different functions.
CompanyOfHeroes,38po6u,TrystonG33K,3,Sat Jun 6 07:28:55 2015 UTC,"Ufortunately, Hit the dirt is not much good anymore. All it does now is grant you yellow cover, so if you are already in yellow or green, it does absolutely nothing."

You want to flush the enemy out with a grenade. If this is the only firefight on the battlefield right now - throw the grenade at the DOOR. There's a high chance that your enemy will monitor this engagement and try to dodge by jumping out of the building."

CompanyOfHeroes,38ip6m,Nanook3400,1 point,Fri Jun 5 23:58:29 2015 UTC,For quick skirmishes it depends on the troops you have. I'll use coh2 as an example. Shock troops verses panzer grenadiers. If you arm the panzer grenadiers with assault rifles they will be effective at medium to long range where shock troops are at a slight disadvantage at medium and close to useless at long range. Anything with a submachine gun needs to get right up in the opponents face and anything that is a rifle needs to stay at longer distances (especially when fighting Germans since they tend to have more automatic weapons). Panzer grenadiers are a happy medium that should be well equipped for most battles especially if you arm them with both scoped rifles and mp44's. Keep the shock troops away with grenades and stay in good cover.

CompanyOfHeroes,38ig35,shitfit_,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:52:02 2015 UTC,In my personal opinion and experience also: the more consecutive wins you have the better your enemies will be. I do not mean the ranking itself. E.g. losing 5 games in a row and falling to rank 5000 in the process I face much easier opponents than winning 5 games and arrive at rank 5000. That is just my personal experience. so it can just be subjective. IMO: The matchmaking does quite an acceptable job. I play 2v2 mainly (511 2v2 AT games) and we are at 51% win/loss ratio currently.

Well then it's no surprise you feel the matchmaking is bad. You don't even have an Elo based rank yet.  Here's how it goes: your rank is determined by your Elo rating. In order to adjust your Elo, your first 10 (ten) matches in each of the different game modes will be completely random. After that, you will be assigned a rank based on your performance against these opponents. Afterwards, you will be matched against players with a similar skill level and you'll go up and down the ladder depending on whether you win or lose the match.  You haven't reached 10 games in any game mode so that's why your games might feel like they are extremely one sided: it will get better afterwards."
CompanyOfHeroes,38ig35,rtc3,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:47:07 2015 UTC,"This. Last Sunday I had an epic win streak of five solid wins in a row. One of them was total pushover (clearly a new player), otherwise the opposition seemed to get tougher as the games went by.  6th opponent was clearly a ""pro"" level guy and I got SO outplayed that it sure pulled me back from any dreams of ""hey I'm so good at this..."" :D  Long win streaks are pretty much impossible to hold - you might luck out with a ""placement match"" newbie after a few wins and get the streak to go just a bit further, but soon enough (usually under 5 matches) the matchmaker will see if you actually know how to play and get matched to someone really good. Lose (like I inevitably tend to, I'm at best an average player) and the next opponent is generally easier. Lose two and I usually get a ""fair fight"".  Seems to me that it is working. Yes, you can get individual ""outlier"" matchups - perhaps the pool of players online was a bit small and eventually it gave up looking for a good match and just gave you whoever was there. Perhaps a really good player had a bad day and lost a few in a row and got ""downgraded"" to a level where you got matched up and he got his groove back.

Ostheer:  -Overall this is the generalist faction and the easiest to understand for someone who starts at COH. You have all your tools at your disposal with the con of having a slower teching. Progression and teching is quite simple.  -Lower number of members per squad makes you to be careful with your units.   -While the faction starts slowly with a delicate early game, it really pays off if you drag the game and play solidly.   -Commander complements your faction rather than defining it (in comparison to Soviets).  USF:  -The faction is meant to be play agressively and never give up the pressure upon your enemy.   -It's all about Riflemen and medium armor. You might have some specific units here and there but they are not the core of your strat.  You generally start heavily with Rifles and you either transition into light vehicles or straight up into medium tanks. In contrast to OH or SU you won't have as many support weapons.  -In contrast to both SU and OH, each of the 6 commander have a specific playstyle and each one gives unique benefits.   OKW:  -While the faction has a resource penalty, it has other benefits with having their units been able to have 5 levels of veterancy, scavenge of resources, cheap teching and utility on their buildings.  -Fewer vehicles but with a stronger potential.  -Faction relies heavily on a big amount of infantry units (doctrinal or not) with some complementary vehicles.

The Pak may have better penetration, but the Zis barrage ability can potentially wipe entire squads and thwart infantry attacks. Sniper is better since the health buff, but its still nowhere near as OP as the soviet marathon sniper was. Also Urrah helps catch up to them quicker and larger squad sizes make them less dangerous to chase.   Also, the SU-85 can pack punches against heavy tanks, more so than most doctrine tanks. A 3 star SU-85 is an automatic can opener."
CompanyOfHeroes,38f08p,Mandarion,6,Mon Jun 8 07:06:24 2015 UTC,"The Wehrmacht is late game oriented and very weak in the early phase, kind of like a carry in a MOBA game. The Soviets are the opposite, very strong out of the gate, but they have to keep that pressure up in order to survive the late-game.  The Wehrmacht has very good grenadiers late game with lmg and rifle grenades, very good tanks from medium to heavy, the best heavy machine gun in the game (mg42) and really really good mines.  The Wehrmacht's main weakness is that is has very small squads (4) and therefore is more likely to loose squads and has to retreat more often than larger soviet squads to avoid disaster. Another inconvenience is the fact that Wehrmacht units require a lot of ammo to be effective, When playing with the Wehrmacht you want to be defensive, insure you have decent fuel and ammo income and plan for a late game victory.  The Soviets on the other hand have ridiculous early game offensive potential (conscripts, molotovs, Penal battalions with flamethrowers in scout cars, scout snipers...) and very decent support weapons (crappy machine guns, but the best mortars in the game and a very versatile field gun). When playing with the soviets you want to put enormous pressure on the opposition from the get go and try to maintain that momentum to disrupt fuel and ammo income for the enemy and try to destroy him before he starts pumping out heavy tanks, tech fast and get those su-85 tank destroyers out because its your only chance against panthers and/or tigers. In fact, a lot o soviet players skip tier 3 (medium armor (t-34) and such...) and go straight for tier 4 (katyushas and su-85).  Most important things tho (regardless of faction) are : 1-don't blob 2-pick up equipment 3-take cover(green)/ garrison buildings 4-put mines all over the place, mines are the shit, mines win games. 5-make sure you have serious AT (field guns and such) before the enemy has medium tanks out"

CompanyOfHeroes,3876ka,ProfessionalDoctor,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:15:05 2015 UTC,(they were used as anti-materiel bullets).   I highly doubt that because the B-Patrone did not have a hard penetrator unlike the regular catridge. IIRC The B-Patrone was totally unable to deal with thicker armour. As Anti Material Rifle the Panzerbüchse 39 or any captured PTRS/PTRD/Boys would have been far more fitting.  If you have sauces otherwise I would be glad if you could provide them
CompanyOfHeroes,3876ka,shitfit_,2,Tue Jun 2 16:16:52 2015 UTC,"First comes the name: B-Patrone stands for Beobachtungspatrone (observation cartridge). The bullet utilises white phosphorus within the secondary igniter that creates a visible white cloud (as visible in the video), but in general not really that useful for anti-personnel use. http://home.scarlet.be/p.colmant/polte.htg/p08.jpg  Unlike what the video claims, the B-Patrone wasn't a copy of the Russian cartridge, but both the Soviet and German cartridge were developed in cooperation by the Reichswehr and the Soviet Union during the 20s and 30s.   During the early war on the Eastern Front, German snipers noticed that rangefinding bullets had serious impact on lightly armoured vehicles like the lend-lease M3 and M5. The round was able to penetrate the thin armour and incapacitate the crew (which still counts as anti-material use if you have as much moral flexibility as the Wehrmacht had).    IIRC the Americans wrote quite a bit about the cartridge here.  P.S.: Sorry for the double post, my internet has hick-ups again...  P.P.S.: Just to explain what happened in the video, when the Soviet round outperformed the German one: The Soviets used Magnesium as the main component to produce the smoke cloud (because white phosphorus is much more difficult to keep from bursting into flames when it comes into contact with oxygen, and thus requires much higher production standards within the factory). However, magnesium has a higher burning speed, i.e. the whole thing is over much more quickly than the B-Patrone. That in the end means, that the B-Geschoss in reality did explode behind the the ballistic gel used in the video, because it took to long to start and finish burning."

CompanyOfHeroes,3851cs,ClaytonIsOnline,9,Sun Jun 14 20:00:49 2015 UTC,"USF leans towards mobility and versatility. Minimum of 3 rifle squads is the recommended amount as a standard build and continue from there. A second Rear Echelon is good for extra capping power but is not a must. I usually keep my rifle squads advancing down the same axis together, and when engaged, try to keep one squad on the flank of another, especially against Sturmpioneers in the early game. Grenades should usually be upgraded, if not for the grenades, smoke grenades are incredibly useful and cheap. BARs are an alright choice if you want that boost of firepower (although I rarely upgrade them). Bazookas should only be but on Rear Echelons, in order to not sacrifice any anti-infantry power. They are a expensive for what they are worth but imo do pay off with vetted REs.  T2 (with lieutenant) opens up good anti-infantry pressure but is incredibly vulnerable to anti-vehicles. I usually avoid it if I see an OKW T3 on the field. Against Ostheer it's more down to micro. M20 pays off if OKW goes T2 and in the late game if you laid mines. AA-halftrack is a good suppression weapon but is very support focused (and expensive if you lose it fast). M2 Browning is a mixed bag. It has turned engagements around for me before but the biggest issue is that it has a small squad size and that Grenadier rifle grenades can be shot off at around its max vision radius.  USF T3 depends on your confidence of your anti-infantry situation. That's why Infantry company usually  goes T3 over T2 because they have access to 1918s. AT gun should be prioritised but keep it behind your lines ready to respond to armour threats. Howitzer is optional especially if you are ahead and if you are facing blobbing (since it has a small suppression AOE when it hits). Only issue is its cost (480 manpower) and ridiculous reinforcement cost. Stuart is situational. It has an expensive fuel cost for a cheaper manpower cost. I usually go Stuart if my opponent and I are even, there is an anti-infantry presence and a lack of anti-armour on your enemy's side and you really doubt that you have the fuel for a Sherman (usually due to the combined fuel cost of a Major and Sherman combined). It scales into a good support tank as well with its abilities but 2 AT shots and its dead. All in all, the main reason to go T3 is you need anti-tank.   T4 is generally recommend in any case. Shermans are the backbone of USF armour although they are significantly stronger anti-infantry than anti-armour. Try to keep them moving at all times and have units supporting them, especially if against other armour. Jacksons are the main anti-tank of the USF. Keep them out of harm's way  and in sync with your armour and they become a threat, even to heavy tanks. Scotts are good if your enemy is dug-in due to their long range. Just watch out because they last about 2 AT gun shots. Another thing about USF is that you can jump crews out. You can use this to quickly vet up Jacksons or critically repair vehicles with critical damage. In general, for USF, T4 represents the mid-game so you want to try and get to it ASAP (around 10 mins and pumping out your 1st vehicle by the 12th min) although that's subjective.   Commander-wise, I only have the basic commanders for now. I usually wait a while before I choose a commander since that can have a great effect on what tech I choose. Airborne is usually safe to tech towards T2. Start to replace riflemen with paratroopers, they have the same reinforce cost of 28 manpower. Pathfinders are optional. T3 is generally recommended for Infantry. Don't upgrade BARS and don't waste munitions on random Time on Targets. I usually hold Time on Target artillery against OKW structures if I can't finish it off. Armour in my opinion is more open with teching. I usually go T2 with Armour and followed by T3 for At guns, since Armour can call in M10s for mobile AT. 250mm arty is good against a clumped, dug-in OKW. In large maps, T4 is generally a must for the reinforcement point so also take that into consideration.  Tactics-wise keep a presence all over the map. If your enemy is concentrated in one side, attack else where and harass his resources.  Take out significant threats ASAP (e.g. isolated bunkers locking down a point). You need mobility. Try to avoid an engagement if out-numbered or if you suspect you will lose since 28 manpower per rifleman adds up. If the map is open, REs can throw down tank traps for cover. Infantry company riflemen can build cover as well. Use mines if available; either M20 or infantry company/assault engineers.   In summary, 3 riflemen as a base. T2 if no OKW T3, good for early anti-infantry pressure. T3 for anti-tank and if confident against infantry. T4 for armour and reinforcement point.  Anti-blob: AA-halftrack, Howitzer, M8 Scott.  Stuart if you need to punish infantry or anti-infantry, confident of lack of anti-tank and can't get a Sherman out at that instance.  *I may edit this if I need to format the paragraphing. Sorry it is so long."
CompanyOfHeroes,3851cs,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,6,Tue Jun 2 06:19:13 2015 UTC,"In the game's current state, USF is possibly the most complicated army and requires an extremely aggressive play style, which takes a while to learn. I would recommend starting by playing Soviet and learning how Infantry, Mortars, and LMGs work with eachother. Then learn how tank combat works (not just tank vs tank but infantry and AT support weapons). Once you understand those game mechanics and how most units work, then you can start working with the western front armies, which play quite different."
CompanyOfHeroes,3851cs,Tagichatn,3,Tue Jun 2 05:45:39 2015 UTC,Riflemen are great basic infantry so you want to be able to keep the upper hand and maintain map control in the beginning. Feel free to upgrade to grenades if they're spamming machine guns so you can toss smoke and close in. Riflemen do great damage up close and decent from far so they can go toe to toe with volks and grens before they get the lmg.
CompanyOfHeroes,3851cs,Igottabadfeeling,3,Mon Jun 1 22:37:33 2015 UTC,"Armour commander is very fun:  1 Assault Engineer --> 2 rifles --> LT -->AA Half track -->Capt-->zooks.  If you need anti tank, call in a Wolverine. If not, wait for the Sherman Bulldozer and bring in Wolverines later as required.  I find a Sherman bulldozer, backed up by 2 Wolverines to be very effective.  Also be sure to make use of as many demolition charges as you can. Those alone have won me many 1v1 matches."
CompanyOfHeroes,3851cs,dumbducky,2,Mon Jun 1 22:58:01 2015 UTC,"How does the wolverine compare to the Jackson?  If I'm armor commander, is it better to call in wolverines or buy Jacksons?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3851cs,USSZim,3,Tue Jun 2 01:09:13 2015 UTC,"It depends. The Wolverine is more mobile than the Jackson and much cheaper, so you can send in more and flank enemy tanks. You can really wreck an early Stug if you surprise it with a Wolverine and get around it. Same goes with a Tiger, although this is much more difficult. Against an Elefant, you can actually run circles around them. Even if you lose the M10, it's a pretty good trade-off.  That being said, the Jackson has a far superior gun and better range. It depends on your playstyle. Generally by the mid-late game the Wolverine is mostly obsolete unless you have good micro.   I personally prefer the Wolverine because I suck with the Jackson."
CompanyOfHeroes,3851cs,Bromao,2,Tue Jun 2 03:04:25 2015 UTC,I think the Wolverine also has more health
CompanyOfHeroes,3851cs,Tomakaze,3,Tue Jun 2 09:12:38 2015 UTC,"M10 Wolverine has 560 health and 120 front armor  180.0/160.0/140.0 pen values at 160 damage  Range: 50  M36 Jackson has 480 health and 130 front armor  240.0/220.0/200.0 pen values at 200 damage  Range: 60  At close range the M10 actually has the same DPS and with the better speed and acceleration, is a much better tank to be aggressive with as well as having the ability to run over inf fairly consistently.  The Jackson only outshines the M10 in greater long range consistency.  Both tanks have AP ammunition abilities.  For the M10 the pen values increase to 250.0/225.0/200.0 and the M36 increases to 300.0/270.0/240.0 plus it does 240 damage instead of 200.  A p4 has 180 armor so you can see that the Jackson will always pen it but the M10 has a 32% chance of deflection at max range. The P4 is also only has a range of 40 and pretty lackluster pen values so it is possible to kite by both tanks.  Against the thicker armor things are a little different.  A panther has  320 frontal armor and 50 range and a tiger has 300 armor and 40 range.  If you are facing these bad boys, you will need that Jackson.  With AP shells activated, the M10 only has a 62% chance to pen the panther.  TL;DR - with the buff to the M10, it is a more efficient TD than the Jackson up until heavy armor and Armor company is a very good commander for certain maps."

CompanyOfHeroes,3851cs,Contaminator,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:08:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot. Do you know what the 3 different penetration values mean? Also, how does armor work vs damage?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3851cs,ZombieRapist,2,Sun Jun 7 14:17:07 2015 UTC,"The 3 values represent pen values at near/medium/far range.  I honestly do not know precisely what constitutes each of those but it is something you just get a general feel for through experience.   Pen chance is penetration divided by armor.  Armor doesn't affect damage.  If the shot penetrates, then the full damage value is given.  Damage affects the health which is a separate value.  The changes to the Jackson are the best way to see how the two numbers interface in the game.  Before, the Jackson had lower pen but a consistent 240 damage.  This forced Axis to not build medium armor because they were dead in 3 shots guaranteed given their armor still wasn't enough.  But, the Jackson had trouble taking out heavy armor because the armor values made pen too inconsistent = Jackson players prayed to the RNG gods in tank engagements.  Then they were patched with better penetration and lower damage requiring four shots to kill medium tanks now, but the same number for panthers yet the penetration was much more reliable.  There is a deflection value that represents damage given even if the shot fails to penetrate.  This number is very low for most weapons (essentially negligible).  A good example was the old ISU-152 before the nerfs and ammo changes.  It used to have an incredibly high deflection damage, so even when it didn't pen the armor, it would still do significant damage to vehicles."

CompanyOfHeroes,3851cs,internet-arbiter,4,Wed Jun 3 02:14:59 2015 UTC,"Bazookas are wonderful against light vehicles, so-so against medium tanks, and worthless against heavy tanks. Nine times out of ten, Germans make one or zero light vehicles/medium tanks and just hold out until heavy tanks. Moral of the story: never get bazookas. Ever. They are a counter to units that are never actually produced.    The US AT gun also doesn't do well against heavies. So basically, just plan on Jacksons and (commanders specific) Wolverines to be your only AT.    Riflemen might be the best T0 infantry in the game (just don't give them worthless bazookas). Keep them at long range against assault troops, short/medium against basic infantry, and use smoke to negate all suppression."

CompanyOfHeroes,3851cs,Waylander0719,2,Wed Jun 3 20:19:08 2015 UTC,"I tend to get 2-3 rifles immediately. If I see MGs coming early, I will get grenades as soon as I have 25 fuel (usually after rifleman 2). Keep your riflemen in pairs so that you can flank enemies.  If you are against OKW, you can use your Rear Echelon troops to suppress their Sturmpioneers. Just put them in cover and use volley fire. Make sure you use it before they get to your position, or else you won't have time to suppress them.   I prefer to save my fuel for T3 (the Captain), because my riflemen are usually enough for anti-infantry. If vehicles are hitting the field, you'll have a squad with dual bazookas and access to AT guns. The Stuart is also really useful against infantry and light-medium vehicles (use its stun ability).   At some point before or after the Captain I like to get BARs, depending on how heavily they are focusing on infantry. Try to get one in each of your squads throughout the mid game, as they make riflemen kraut-killing machines. Around the same time get an ambulance, you want to keep your squads' health up and give them the ability to reinforce near the front. Just don't let enemies find the ambulance, it dies just by sneezing on it.  After this, get a major when you have 90 fuel. Put him near your ambulance because he has a forward retreat point ability.   At this point, spam Shermans! If you went Airborne, let the P47 strikes do the heavy lifting against armor."

Us Forces rely on the quality of their riflemen squads. I would recommend buying the rifle company, I won't say it's op... but it's really good. The strengths of the Us Forces are the riflemen, the BAR light machine guns and the Jackson tank destroyers, a few of which can crush heavy armor almost instantly. Never rely on tank destroyers by themselves tho, always support them with AT guns and Bazooka squads in case they are rushed by heavier armor."

He also has a preference for casting ""entertaining"" games, without any kind of emphasis on competitive settings, although most of his games are fairly high level.  On the other hand, he isn't that good of a player so he often misses some of the fine nuances of the games he casts and he can be kind of biased towards certain units and play styles. He also has some rather weird quirks about casting games and can get a bit silly. For example, he won't cast any team game featuring a mix of Allied players (SU and USF) because ""realism"" but at the same time he has no issue with OKW and Wehrmacht teams.  My recommendation would be to stick with Romeo, he also does a fair amount of casting and is probably the most knowledgeable caster there is. He's a pretty good player so his analysis is pretty on point and goes deep into the fine details about the decisions made by each player."

CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Panzerd1er,7,Mon Jun 1 01:51:24 2015 UTC,"I do think that Wehr is underperforming. I actually do like riflegrenades, and the MG42 does quite a bit of dmg now, but Wehr just doesn't have any unit that performs consistently well right now, other than the Pak40 and Panther.   The Panzergrens probably need some sort of buff. They're a little fragile with 4 models to be good at their close range role, and upgrading them to do AT isn't particularly enticing when the Pak40 is as good as it is. I would give them a 5th model, maybe at Vet 1, although that sort of messes with the small unit size theme that Wehr has going on.  I suspect we'll see some interesting changes in the next patch."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Katter,2,Mon Jun 1 06:29:33 2015 UTC,Nice thing about Panzer Grenadiers is that they're actually pretty good at medium to long range. They're not Fallschirmjagers but they perform well as long  as they have some cover
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,TrystonG33K,7,Mon Jun 1 21:51:32 2015 UTC,"One problem with Pgrens is that a lot of people treat them like Shock troopers. Pgrens excel when standing still at medium range behind cover... At least until they get 1-shot by a 120mm mortar. That brings us to the real problem - the consequences that CoH2's AOE damage have on the small squad sizes of the Ostheer. While 1-shot wipes are prevalent for all factions (King tigers demonstrate this rather well against 6-man conscript squads), the Ostheer are clearly at a disadvantage in the same situation given their 4-man squad sizes.   For the game to really feel balanced, I think Anti-infantry AOE damage needs to be closely examined across the board. While units like the Panzerwerfer definitely need a buff, others like the Stug-E are overperforming simply due to the nature of HE shells. Likewise, unit model ""clumping"" needs to be addressed, since that is also detrimental to the survivability of infantry when all four models go for a group hug during a mortar barrage. One possibility is to reduce  medium-AOE damage for all HE shells while adding a suppression modifier like the Pack-Howitzer or Leichtes Infanterie Geschütz have. This would add utility to HE shells while preventing squad wipes.  The next problem has to do with the late-game options and current meta-game, and I'm going to have to disagree with your statement about the weak late-game of the Wehrmacht. It has always been strong, but the Soviet late-game is now just as strong (or stronger since they are less likely to skip teching due to their nonlinear tech tree). Furthermore, the Tiger is no longer a ""win"" button due to its armor and blitz nerfs. I think Relic made those changes in the hopes that Ostheer players would consider T4 as an alternative to Tigers, but the opportunity cost is too great. Honestly, Ostheer T4 is still potent (With the Panzerwerfer as the only underperforming unit), and as a Soviet player I would rather go up against Tigers than Panthers.  I think there needs to be significant changes to either the cost of teching or how teching factors into call-in availability for all sides (i.e. make call in's ""built"" from an appropriate structure). As a consequence, no faction would be able to sit on their thumbs until they have CPs for Tigers, IS-2s, etc., which would open up the possibility for extended mid games (not that that will ever happen)."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Rarharg,0,Mon Jun 1 13:21:51 2015 UTC,"what you say about the squad sizes vs that fucking 120mm is so true, it's bad enough when you've got 5 volks in cover, the pgrens always bunch up and that thing always kills them, they' aren't like the obers that can stay on the move while maintaining solid DPS, the pgrens do alright on the move and up close, but they are optimal for mid-range and standing still"
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,bmwatson132,13,Mon Jun 1 18:48:49 2015 UTC,"They are definitely the worst. But its primarily due to their teching costs. As well as a decent amount of UP units. Ost also has the least amount of OP units. Mainly the stug e.  Aside from teching.  The units that need a looking at are: FHT, 222, stug3, brummbar, and panzerwerfer. Almost all of them need performance buffs. Some need price reductions too. Mostly just the brummbar.  Ost is still great fun but the call in meta and 1 shot wipes hurt them the most of all factions."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,daspoulos,3,Mon Jun 1 03:36:05 2015 UTC,"The Sturmpanzer performs quite well, actually. I wouldn't say no to a cost reduction though, because right now there is no reason to pick it over a StuG E..."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Mandarion,2,Mon Jun 1 08:50:27 2015 UTC,"My problems though is that its shells are fired like they are attached to a bunch of helium balloons, they aren't to accurate and when they are easy to dodge.

CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Nullclast,-12,Tue Jun 9 09:24:06 2015 UTC,"USF is definitely the worst for a number of reasons. First off, Grenadiers are far better than rifles in almost every respect. The faust is far superior than the AT grenade and isn't locked away behind Vet 1. The Gren LMG and rifle grenade are unlocked behind tier 2, both which are better than the Rifleman Grenade that requires a shorter distance, a very obvious throwing animation, air travel time and fuse detonation as opposed to the subtle crouch, air time, and then explosion. And the Gren LMG is far better than the doctrinal Specific M1919. The only thing rifles have that is better is one model count higher than Grens. So no Grens do not need a buff."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,TheWhiteElephant123,7,Mon Jun 1 10:33:37 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the rifle grenade of the Grenadiers still bugs out quite often and simply doesn't fire (not to mention that the wind up on the rifle grenade is longer than the throw time and count-down on the American grenade combined). On top of that, the American grenade is the best in the game, as it has the biggest AOE and (weirdly) seems to deal the full damage right until the edge of the AOE. On top of that, you unlock smoke grenades with the same upgrade on your rifles.  And the stuff about the M1919 is plain wrong, if you equip your squad with them you will see that they both are roughly the same, combined with the fact that it is virtually impossible to one-shot them they make by far the better infantry and are the reason why the Ostheer currently has no chance in the early game. Hence why most players go the ""safe"" way of spamming StuG Es, which makes the game kind of boring if you play against Ostheer at the moment..."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Mandarion,2,Mon Jun 1 11:20:21 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind though that the rifle grenade has the advantage of range, rifles have to close the distance just to have the same effect while simultaneously having to pay for the grenades as an extra expenditure. What this means is that it's very obvious as to what the USF player is trying to do, that is close the distance, while getting shot at, all to throw a grenade that is very easy to dodge. And to address the M1919, even if they were exactly the same as the LMG 42, they are still doctrine specific as in you have to choose infantry company just to get them. This is NOT the same as grens always having access to the LMG, pretty much if you want your rifles to be able to have to the same damage output as grens yourcommander choices quickly become reduced. Do you not see the problem with this?"
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,TheWhiteElephant123,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:49:27 2015 UTC,"Of course I see the problem with this. I also see the problem that Riflemen vs. non-LMG Grens will win in practically any situation. On top of that, the Ostheer needs so much ammunition to stay competitive, that outfitting every Grenadier-squad with LMGs is not an option…"
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Mandarion,3,Tue Jun 2 15:58:10 2015 UTC,"That isn't true at all.  With the LMG you get defensive stance, which suppresses.  All units shout grenade when your enemy is throwing or launching one.  Use this to dodge them.  And Riflemen are by far the best base infantry in the game.  Did you know that riflemen still out DPS a gren squad with G43s?  I'm not saying grens need a buff, but don't pretend that riflemen are terrible compared to them.  Yea, the riflenade sucks, but you get non doctrinal immobilizing mines.  Thats a fair trade off."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,PreserveTM,7,Mon Jun 1 19:32:14 2015 UTC,USF the worst?! You're trolling.
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Gdott,-7,Mon Jun 1 12:36:42 2015 UTC,"Nope no trolling, they are arguably the worst faction. It's absolutely not a coincidence that the search percentages are always skewed to the Axis because it's obvious that they are easier to play. Axis are the easier factions of the game they rely on less units of higher quality, that's why the squad sizes are smaller but better overall. The vehicles as well are more expensive but always of higher quality. What this really equates to is less micro and higher versatility of the units in turn creating easier factions. Gren faust is pretty much guaranteed an engine crit, the only tank I've seen it bounce is the IS-2 sometimes. If you try and compare the Soviet and USF AT grenade you are out of your mind. The support weapons are better, the anti tank is better, the call ins are better and the starting infantry IS better with a greater range of abilities. I really don't understand why people ignore these facts."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,TheWhiteElephant123,2,Mon Jun 1 18:13:15 2015 UTC,Call ins better...You do realize the IS-2 has the same frontal armor as the KT right?

If you can't dodge rifle gernades then that's bad micro on your part, but rifle in every way are better close range the dominate. Obvious throwing animation? Lead the grenade,  and rifle gernades aren't that bad they bounce more but are still good you just need to be quick. If they are beating you before you can get up and personal smoke and charge in.  You just need to get about 4-5 rifle squads all with bazooka and run around killing everything. You get pinned? Smoke smoke smoke. Still pinned? Captain has an ability for that. After you're at tier 3 get a Scott and say goodbye to all your problems then backup 2-e Jackson's and another scott. There is a reason US is preferred 75% of time to pros."

That is not a viable solution to the problem, in fact blobbing is what really kills this game. And you make tier progression and getting four tanks out seem like a cakewalk. And no, mos pros do not go USF in tournaments, if they have to go allies they will pick Soviets because it's well understood by pros that USF is laughably bad if you don't believe me you should watch the star crossed cups/kings.

As of right now the game is probably the most balanced it has ever been so it's likely a problem with your strategy, and not the faction itself. If you gave us some more deets I'm sure everyone would be happy to help :)"
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Ivanthehorrendous,2,Mon Jun 1 02:51:24 2015 UTC,"Well it was pretty vague more or less to see if I could start a discussion and get other people's input. But I suppose in my personal opinion the Wehr seems to lack something of sustenance that's really powerful and direct. For example: The US has the pack howitzer, OKW has the leIG, and the Soviets have the SU 76M or the Zis. Wehr doesn't have anything really heavy hitting direct unit that can act as artillery unless it's a call-in like the LefH.  The only thing I could use would be a Brummbar, and that takes a while to get and is expensive and not as rapidly accessible as a piece of artillery.  I have other complaints but I'd say lack of direct fire artillery is my biggest."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,gentleman_caller,2,Mon Jun 1 03:05:06 2015 UTC,"I lathe using arty cuz of all the call in bombs and what not, almost never an issue except the American call in mobile arty.  With Ost I find putting an mg behind my units firing advancements works.  excepting a grim early game has always been a fact of Ost life.  All that said, I'd like to see volks and grens get a little better.  Volks are almost useless without the mg upgrade nowadays.  Grens shrek upgrade basically takes them outta the infantry fight, and they're pretty expensive, especially after the upgrade.  I know it's probably asinine, but I think Tigers should be like Konigs: available after all 4 buildings.  Tigers were pretty prevalent in the war."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,notabrahamlincoln,2,Mon Jun 1 06:10:38 2015 UTC,"The SU76 might honestly be one of the worst units in the game and the LeFH is also really bad. Which commanders are you using? As Ost you should be using commanders which allow you to not build Tier 4 buildings (meaning no panzerwerfer, brummbar or Panther). I highly recommend Close Air Support (dick move I know, but it works), Mechanized Assault, lightning war, or Luftwaffe supply.  Also try not getting shrecks on Panzergrenadiers unless you really need them, they're amazing against infantry with their base stgs."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Mandarion,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:36:13 2015 UTC,"Jaeger Armour. If you manage to keep that 251 alive, you will do massive rage-damage to your enemies when they hit a Riegelmine (which immobilises), allowing your Elefant to laugh its metal arse off.  It's also the only time your Pioneers will feel like they are an actual unit, pop them into your 251, drive them into the enemy and laugh, as long as the enemy isn't a Shocktroop unit. Even your 251 will vet up this way without getting the flame-upgrade..."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,TrystonG33K,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:34:57 2015 UTC,I don't think Jager armor has the halftrack that units can shoot from. Riegel mines are laid from the stock halftrack.

CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Kradis,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:10:33 2015 UTC,"Eh, I can think of a few things that are a lot worse than the Su-76, like the Stug its a pretty mediocre AT weapon, unlike the Stug it has the added advantage of at least having a non vetted HE barrage.   Definitely agree on the commander point, teching to T4 really is a waste for Ostheer, if you can skip T4, or even T3 until you can start rolling out the Tigers and using Doctrine abilities to cover your barrage and direct fire needs."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Rarharg,3,Mon Jun 1 06:15:11 2015 UTC,"I'd say Su76 and Stug-G are pretty much tied for uselessness. The Stug-G has target weakpoint (which is one of the best AT abilities available to the tank destroyers in CoH2) but has abysmal armor/health. Meanwhile, the free barrage of the Su-76 is both its greatest strength and weakness, since it is incredibly vulnerable during the ability. Furthermore, the Su-76 has incredibly poor penetration, making it a waste of resources that could otherwise be invested in T34s (better vs infantry) or Su-85s (better vs tanks).   I wish we saw more of both units, but in their current state, they are nigh useless against the call-in meta. The Stug could use a frontal armor buff and the Su-76 needs a penetration buff (at this point, it  barely penetrates more than a PTRS rifle...)."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,TrystonG33K,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:57:05 2015 UTC,"The Stug G works pretty well if you don't treat it like a tank. It has decent splash, so hammering enemy squads from just behind your infantry can do some real damage. I wish they'd give the SU-76 some extra splash on its main attack so it could also be used like a Stug"
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Handy_Banana,2,Mon Jun 1 22:33:04 2015 UTC,And that was exactly how the Stug was used in the actual war too.  It was designed to clear bunkers and support infantry assaults.  It was never meant to with stand attacks from enemy armor.

CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,9,Thu Jun 4 20:18:47 2015 UTC,"Since day 1 of this game the balance between Ostheer and Soviets have been crap because of how the early game units perform. Molotovs and Urrah are so much more useful than rifle grenades. Maxim setup time makes it amazingly better inside buildings. MG34s wider fire range is almost nullified by urrah/molotov combo. Soviet mortars have the pinpoint fire ability and more accurate barrages. Zis field guns can barrage and potentially wipe units and single handily halt advances. Soviet snipers are inherently better because of Ostheer unit sizes. Fortunately, when the game first came out it was much easier to get a Panzer IV out and they were amazing back then. Now they can barely 1v1 a T34/76 and Ostheer is hurting even in the armor department.   The comparison between Panzerwerfer and the Katyusha is laughable and is and has been a huge imbalance in this game. Indirect fire is incredibly important in CoH's rock paper scissor style combat and in this game the Russians undoubtedly have the best indirect fire. 120mm adds to this issue. For a very long time the B4 was on that list also, 1 shot wiping units from across the map with precision strikes the soviets can easily afford with their munitions float."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Meyerd,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:00:25 2015 UTC,As Ostheer I've noticed it's been harder to perform at the level I was before (still shit) but I always just thought that it was entirely me but now that you point it out those are what seems to usually get me.  But with that being said I'm still pretty shitty.
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Kradis,4,Mon Jun 1 05:30:36 2015 UTC,You can add the original ISU-152 into the list of horrifying soviet units to come up against before the ammo type change. Absurd range that couldn't even be matched by an Elefant and a combined AP/HE round that was effective at both squad wiping and heavily damaging or stunning any Ostheer tank.

Armor-wise, I would say what really gets me more than anything is how much insanely better the IS-2 is than the Tiger.  I understand that the IS2 is supposed to out-class the tiger, but it simply goes too far, the thing has the same armor as a KT and almost as much firepower, but you often can't penetrate it even from min range, and that is infuriating to watch. At close range both the Tiger and the IS2 should be penetrating each other's frontal armor almost every shot, instead the IS2 will fuck up the Tiger and the Tiger will get no damage on the IS2, meaning that even if the tiger dies, as it almost always does, you won't even be able to follow it up with some other AT and finish off the IS2, it just nullifies the tiger completely. I have watched this happen so many times that I simply stopped investing in tigers when fighting Shock Rifle commander.  You have to get insanely lucky and hit it in the ass if you expect to do any real damage, good luck with that."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,PreserveTM,5,Mon Jun 1 18:43:28 2015 UTC,"Don't forget all mortars require at least 2 models to live, but the most powerful mortar in the game only requires one and starts with a 6 man squad..."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,2,Mon Jun 1 19:41:54 2015 UTC,"They kind of dropped the ball with the IS-2. It should have been the equivalent to the King Tiger as they both popped out in late war 1944 and featured thick, sloped armor. The Tiger really shouldn't be put at ends with the IS tanks, as tank warfare was totally different when the Tiger first showed on the field. The IS-2 was the end product responding to 2 years of Russian tanks battling Tiger I's. That's one of the problems with WWII games. Warfare changed so much between 1938 and 1945 that it's hard to balance the more infamous units of the war."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Duder211,2,Tue Jun 2 00:15:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, these different factions are from certain years of the war, they just throw all units and equipment from different stages of the war together and try and balance it."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,anon4773,7,Thu Jun 4 20:31:39 2015 UTC,After this last patch I would say OKW is worse off.
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,Kradis,3,Mon Jun 1 05:22:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't at all, OKW still has a massive advantage in infantry diversity and they have heavy tanks and tank destroyers which can actually compete with the current IS2 and 34/85s that are seen a lot in the larger games."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,anon4773,5,Mon Jun 1 06:05:52 2015 UTC,"Their mainline infantry blows.  diverse shit is still shit.  In 1v1s by the time the KT is out OKW has lost map control.    Any one of their tanks goes down to two 34/85s and add mark target then a panther or jagpanzer is done.  Guard Motor is the anti-OKW.  Ostheer has LMG grens with rifle nades and fausts.    Edit: Keep downvoting, nevermind how guards snipe obers at long range now and that Panzerfusiliers are the only cost effective anti-infantry rifle squad OKW can build.  Four (with necessary shrek) Volks rifles shooting at cons or riflemen doesn't cut it in 1v1s anymore."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,PreserveTM,6,Mon Jun 1 06:23:19 2015 UTC,Guard Motor + T1 is pretty much instant win against OKW.
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,TheLuftwaffle,2,Mon Jun 1 19:43:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree... I think a huge mistake Relic made when creating the U.S. Army was making it so they're designed to rely almost solely on the Riflemen in their early game since they're the only faction that has to tech up in order to get MGs. As a result, they pretty much forced themselves to make them early game overkill."
CompanyOfHeroes,3811pa,A_Loki_In_Your_Mind,3,Tue Jun 2 05:46:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah they suck. The maxim outclasses the mg42, conscripts can ourah and fuck up grens at close range.

CompanyOfHeroes,380uyx,Omega_Warrior,3,Mon Jun 1 03:21:05 2015 UTC,"Default perspective is usually the best that most players use, but I know a few who like to change the angle sometimes, but that's usually just so they are facing the enemy or something. Constantly changing perspective isn't a good idea mid game as there is usually some sort of micro that is better to spend your time on. So I would say try to get used to the default.  I and many other players use scripts to bind to to WASD and it will probably increase your micro ability as well if you do. You might also want to bind other important keys to easy to acess locations as well, like the reverse and attack move commanders. As well as time intensive abilities like smoke and grenades. i wouldn't say it's necessary though as I went a good two years before changing my keys."

Nowadays I just drag scroll & use command groups to get around (like in starcraft2). Occasionally a sneaky Wehr player hides a bunker behind a tall building, that's what the ALT is for."
CompanyOfHeroes,380uyx,cplcarlman,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:15:42 2015 UTC,I usually only rotate the camera at the beginning of the round.  (For some reason I always like having my base at the bottom of the screen and having my troops move upwards.)  I then use the backspace key (once) to reset the camera angle to default.    I usually strafe the camera (left/right/up/down) by moving my mouse cursor to the edge of the screen.  Sometimes I also use the middle mouse button (pressing and holding down the mouse wheel) to move the camera around as well.
CompanyOfHeroes,380uyx,FrequentPilgrim,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:00:04 2015 UTC,Ok so I got it set up with a hotkey script from a Steam guide. Now im using WASD for camera controls and that's working SOOO much better for me. Sticking with default perspective now. Only problem is since things are re-mapped I can't type in the chat... :(

I love when an SU player rushes me with shocks and flame-engis/penals because they're just playing into the perfect reason to buy a flame HT.

CompanyOfHeroes,37z6dz,warbastard,3,Fri Jun 5 01:43:45 2015 UTC,I like your point about Flame HT. Lots of German faction players won't spend fuel on T2 or early game vehicles and just save for the late game tanks. It's a good idea but we all know that Allied infantry can overwhelm you in early-mid game. Vehicles like the Luchs and flame HT need intense micro but can get squad wipes when they chase retreating squads. Don't always tech straight to tanks. Those light vehicles can give you breathing room if you manage them well.    Plus I've been guilty of building a panther and then losing the game because the Allies had such a lead in infantry.
CompanyOfHeroes,37z6dz,battlemetal_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:22:37 2015 UTC,"I still think the luchs is viable through to end game - it's a great compliment with panthers to pound away at a blob, and it's detection ability can turn flanks into ambushes."
CompanyOfHeroes,37z6dz,nowes,7,Wed Jun 3 11:33:43 2015 UTC,"Any armor will do, even 221 (actually 222 as you would need the weapon upgrade) 2 Mg's watching each other helps, bunker stops them. Even a single mg is efficient. When the toss the smoke unpack go backwards and deploy, the shocks can't see you either (moving away).   Grenadiers might work as 2-3 squad troops or panzer grens as 2 squads. Keep them appart and try to kite with one unit as the other deals damage. Shocks mostly hurt when they get near so its quite safe to shoot them from long to middish range. Kite with other and shoot with other swap if needed."
CompanyOfHeroes,37z6dz,DaTokzik,1 point,Sun May 31 17:26:51 2015 UTC,"I feel like they key is letting two squads or one squad and armor work together, as you said. Let them bleed out before they get in close range and they're essentially useless."

CompanyOfHeroes,37z6dz,Black_Light,3,Mon Jun 1 16:23:39 2015 UTC,"Most of the issues when people mention smoke is a matter of micro. Smoke doesn't render your units stuck to the ground, so you just need to unpack, move back and keep shooting."
CompanyOfHeroes,37z6dz,Contaminator,3,Sun May 31 20:08:32 2015 UTC,"A really solid micro + baiting usually works well against shocks in general. The only other solution is a vehicle of some sort.  The trick with shocks is that they're predictable. Typically your opponent will only have one or two shock units, and you just need to spread your grens out and bait him into chasing one of them down. Then while the shocks are chasing the bait you should have your other units focus fire on one of the shock squads. If your opponent changes target, which is likely, then quickly turn your bait squad to fire and start moving away the new target.  Shocks rapidly loose their effectiveness after losing two or three models and most players will retreat them at this point, so that should be what you aim for.  I realise that saying ""Oh just use more micro"" is pretty lousy advice, however as you've already pointed out MG42's are kinda useless, and vehicles are the only other clear option. Coming from someone who predominantly plays soviets / wehrmacht I can tell you that this tactic of baiting and focus fire is what really kills me when I use shocks, it's hard not to fall for the bait when you know your shock squad will trash just about anything if you can get close enough."
CompanyOfHeroes,37z6dz,Duder211,1 point,Sun May 31 21:08:07 2015 UTC,Mg42 useless? Maybe the crew mg not the lmg. Lmg chews on shocks like star bursts.  Best way to deal with shocks is pull back from smoke. Then hit them at mid range with stationary pgrens or lmg obers. Also having more than one unit as the counter is best.

CompanyOfHeroes,37z6dz,MA-V,1 point,Sun May 31 17:42:16 2015 UTC,"I think a key factor is just having enough units to focus them down. They cost a lot, so don't expect to go 1v1 ever; it works a lot better to just have 3 units together when you know you're facing shocks. If you can manage to focus down the shocks, you'll really bleed his manpower fast. Think of taking down Shocks as an objective, on par with taking victory points."

Easy & standard - computer doesnt even try to roll your base Hard - computer gets same resources as you and tries to roll your base Expert - computer gets crazy fuel, so tanks come really fast.  You can beat expert. Some people can beat two experts though thats getting really hard and map dependent.  Just keep playing! You'll get better and it wont feel so much like a race. You could also watch some replays of better folks, or watch on twitch what people do at higher levels. You'll find that the computer is very ""dumb"" and quite boring to play against eventually"

You KNOW they are going to run their units around your mg's, so be more mobile with your MG's (just like playing against a good human)  You KNOW they'll get tanks faster than you, just like when you're doing badly against a good human, so practice your AT gun and snare skills.  Yes it is a lot of micro, but go watch the pros play- they manage micro just fine (they dont ""watch"" a unit fight, they just issue orders and move to the next unit)  Expert also doesn't push when it knows you're weak, they push predictably. They also don't flank like a human (huge flanks that you were not expecting, or tank rushes, or inf wave rushes)  Until recently, they didn't even use their off board call in well.

And yes, the gap between easy and standard is pretty difficult if you haven't played a lot, but once you get the hang of hockey's, retreating, and other key aspects, standard turns to easy, and you're off onto hard!"

CompanyOfHeroes,37xku7,internet-arbiter,3,Sun May 31 07:31:16 2015 UTC,The explanation is that certain units have a time of site scene when they are hit or hit another unit. You couple that with rate of fire and you get the above scenario.

CompanyOfHeroes,37xku7,BarrierX,2,Sun May 31 22:16:54 2015 UTC,"I never saw a real bug like that there is usually a good reason. Tanks have a longer firing range than vision range. If the ai has some infantry that can see your tank, their tank will fire at you from the fog of war. Some Wehrmacht commanders also have spotting scopes which increase the vision of tanks. You can also be seen by planes or camouflaged units in cover.  When you are playing vs real players they often use attack ground to fire in the fog of war and hit your tanks, not sure if the AI does that."
CompanyOfHeroes,37xku7,Katter,1 point,Sun May 31 07:56:01 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, there is another unit spotting for them. Sometimes, it might just be that the terrain is blocking you for some reason but not them. While that's crummy, it isn't like it always happens. I'm not sure, but some tanks may have different sight ranges than other, and that's not including those that have abilities that increase their sight range."
CompanyOfHeroes,37xku7,Slashenbash,3,Sun May 31 09:34:22 2015 UTC,"There is a mod (tuning category) that limits the fuel production, it actually makes the game focus more on infantry movement and eventually a tank but since the quantity is so low you have to be really careful and strategic with it.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=356386505  This might be interesting to you."

There are certain game mechanics that are adjusted to give the AI an advantage on higher difficulty. E.g. they get more resources, their units build faster, their units do more damage etc.   also the fog of war is terribly buggy. some times I get fired at by enemy tanks 10 feet in front of my tank. but he's shrouded in the fog of war.    This is actually one of those game mechanics I mentioned earlier. The AI are not affected by fog of war when set to harder difficulties (Hard and Expert I believe).

I find that Hard AI plays pretty well, but a little predictable, and playing against Expert AI in team games isn't so bad, since their fuel advantage is sort of spread out against multiple players.

All the online ""how to"" resources I've found either don't take Steam into consideration, or they're outdated in some other way.  I've only found one ""how to"" video that takes Steam and the ""New Steam Version"" into account, and it's only in reference to one mod with its own installation tool. I'm currently trying to install it.  Otherwise, most mods either have no installation tool (you need to know where to put the files yourself) or the installation tool directs the files to folders which don't exist in any Steam version."

For that mod you should only have to run the installer and point it to your 'Company of Heroes Relaunch' folder.

It would just give you the ability to use your tanks better/make tanks feel more fluid while requiring more user input (i hesitate to say more micro as right now you need excessive micro to make your tank not completely shit)  If it was too much maybe an option for turning them on and off, like a 'tactical tank' UI, vs a minimal control UI (for players that didn't want them)."

Sorry for not making that clear.  The thing about the empty spaces though is that most units have at most half of them in use. Maybe it wouldn't be as bad as I'm imagining it would be in practice, but I have problems with hotkey overlapping between units (like being unable to retreat infantry because a vehicle is also selected by accident).

I know this has been pointed out previously on forums, and maybe here also, but please this needs to happen. If an infantry unit is good mid and potentially close range, and gets a veterancy cloaking ability, that ability is completely useless if it just pot shots, breaking cloak, at anything that comes into its range.  Further, I would think the UI could handle this given for each unit, on the right hand ability UI, there are 12 potential spaces for buttons. If I know my pz4s correctly, only 5 are taken up by standard. With a 6th and 7th for Tank smoke and release from hull down. If there are any further, I'd like to know, but at aleast currently that still leaves 5 open slots, enough for hold fire, imperative forward movement, imperative backward movement, idk, maybe even a fancy, target with machine gun command."
CompanyOfHeroes,37s4ux,DaTokzik,1 point,Sat May 30 00:22:33 2015 UTC,"agreed.  Also, weird to have a stealth unit have its most optimal range at medium. Usually you want to stealth ambush and at point blank you would get the most dps to shred them up. But falls have the best dps relative to other units at medium range, so while good ambushing isn't as deadly as if they were say invisible shocks."
CompanyOfHeroes,37s4ux,nickbass95,3,Sat May 30 03:19:08 2015 UTC,"I disagree - they still do strictly MORE damage at close range than at medium range, so waiting until they're point blank is still the best option. Their longer effective range just means they can also mow down the unit once it tries to retreat, where shocks wouldn't be able to effectively damage them once they started running."
CompanyOfHeroes,37s4ux,DaTokzik,2,Sat May 30 15:39:49 2015 UTC,"Well falls do good point blank damage. The problem is  A) they are SUPER FUCKING SQUISHY, like they must have 0 accuracy recieved modifiers i've had them lose 2 models fighting combat engis at point blank. I feel like they are the squishiest infantry in the okw army  B) They have good dps but it scales at medium, and is out done by a lot of units at point blank. Airborne, guards, shocks, most other elite infantry will beat falls at pointblank. Falls will CRUSH most units in a mid range fight, where most units have a lot of fall off. Falls only lose like 30-40% of their dps going mid range, where most other units lose 50-70% (shocks lose like 80-90%).   Given these it doesn't make sense to engage a lot of other units in a point blank ambush, and instead to use falls as very mobile mid range units (their dps while moving is crazy). Or used as support weapon snipers.  They would be better if they were tankier, but right now they are so squishy if they ambush the wrong squad at point blank they can just die."
CompanyOfHeroes,37s4ux,PoolInRiver,1 point,Sat May 30 15:46:33 2015 UTC,"Well I don't know why you've been losing them to Guards at close range - Guards are a long range unit. I guess we'll just blame that on RNG. At that range though all bets are off. I think Falls are best to always keep some cover between them and their target, but even so, close to mid range combat is possible and quite effective."

CompanyOfHeroes,37uo48,Masterfuzzfuzz,8,Sat May 30 15:25:29 2015 UTC,"The Ostheer mortar auto-fires faster and more accurately and is generally firing at larger squads with more health.  The tradeoff is that the Soviet one has more health, and is generally firing at smaller squads with less health. It also has a superior veterancy ability.  Basically, you never want to get into artillery wars with SU. When it comes to cost efficiency they have the best artillery pieces bar none. It's kind of their thing.   For 80 fuel and very easy accessibility you get the Katyusha, which has the lowest cooldown and highest damage capability of all the pieces. The Panzerwerfer is worse in pretty much every single way. The Walking Stuka is a lot better at precision striking setup teams and other vehicles, but comes with the longest cooldown of all the artillery and an effective cost of ~160 fuel.  The ML-20 is better than the leFH in every single way. The B4 has extreme potentials for squad wipes.  The 120 mm has the largest splash and longest range of all the other mortars, the only real competitor that comes close is the Pack Howitzer, and then only at vet 2.  The ""german mortar is better"" is mostly just RNG salt from prolonged engagements you never should be taking as SU without your own mortar support.  Because 9 times out of 10, your mortar will pay off and win out."
CompanyOfHeroes,37uo48,TheNataris,4,Sat May 30 15:48:33 2015 UTC,"I was with you until you stated that the Katyusha was superior to the walking stuka.  The stuka has the ability to wipe multiple squads with every single barrage with very little chance for the allies to escape the bombardment.  In contrast,  the katy barrage takes forever from the the first impact to the last and the impacts are so speak out that sometimes I've had katy strikes kill no one even when the strike was well placed and the enemy never moved.. The katy is more fragile to enemy fire as well."
CompanyOfHeroes,37uo48,cplcarlman,3,Sat May 30 21:39:57 2015 UTC,"I don't get it, if the effective cost if the walking stuka is 160 then why not take tech into consideration for the katyshka?"
CompanyOfHeroes,37uo48,illioneus,2,Sat May 30 19:19:49 2015 UTC,"Because OKW only has ~66% fuel income. Soviets have 100% + access to caches. Admittedly I only did a rough estimate. The ""actual"" cost is about 151,2 fuel. Which means you can get nearly 2 Katyushas for each Walking Stuka the enemy has, provided it's an even game.  If you want the ""raw"" tech costs it's 212 fuel for OKW and 250 for SU.  Of course, the OKW also has access to munitions-to-fuel conversion from the same truck, but it does mean they effectively lose resources due to the conversion rates back and forth between the two."
CompanyOfHeroes,37uo48,TheNataris,3,Sat May 30 19:30:00 2015 UTC,"I can't agree that the Katyusha is a straight up better unit than the Walking Stuka. I'd say they're equally accessible to boot, though the OKW won't be able to recover from the fuel for a bit longer thanks to the income penalty."
CompanyOfHeroes,37uo48,velmarg,2,Sat May 30 20:56:33 2015 UTC,"The 120 mm has the largest splash and longest range of all the other mortars   And a ridiculously satisfying ability at vet 1. I'm sorry, did you want to keep that squad alive? And that support weapon? And that light vehicle?"
CompanyOfHeroes,37uo48,ZarnoLite,2,Sat May 30 19:22:43 2015 UTC,"I mainly only play big games (4v4) so most of what im saying means nothing in smaller games.  But i typically see Ober bringing out a stuka artillery by 8 minutes, maybe even sooner.  No way Sov can get a katy by then, more unlikely of a katy actually killing a halftrack unless its minimum range and doesnt move.  The squad wiping ability especially if you went T2 SOV is unmatchable."
CompanyOfHeroes,37uo48,morice321,2,Sun May 31 02:03:08 2015 UTC,"Difficult to test, unless cheat mod can give veterancy to units, but I think it comes down to the german mortar getting much better with veterancy."
CompanyOfHeroes,37uo48,thefonztm,6,Sat May 30 15:49:32 2015 UTC,"I remember getting into a fight with you on Twitch about this. What exactly is testing the mortars 1v1 telling us? That the mortar with 6 guys wins against the mortar with 4 guys? That makes sense.  In a way, all of the Soviet team weapons will beat the German team weapons. The Maxim will suppress the MG42 faster and likely survive the ensuing fight with its larger squad size. The mortar will last longer, can be retreated with one man left whereas the German mortar needs at least two, and can aim shot to eliminate it - hell, even the ZIS can counter the Pak 40 with a barrage.  And yet, all of the German weapons, when used in the field performing their duties with proper support, WILL perform better than their Soviet counterparts. The German mortar's rate of fire and accuracy superiority mean it will kill infantry faster and more reliably. The MG42 is the best machine gun in the game, with a ridiculous field of fire and the highest damage, not to mention it's indendiary ammo. The Pak 40 is the best AT gun in the game, easily.   Your test proves that the Soviet mortar will probably win in a fight against the German mortar head to head, but if you think the Soviet mortar actually performs better as an indirect fire weapon against enemy infantry, there's no way we're playing the same game.   There's a reason the German mortar is fragile and can't be retreated with less than 2 men.  It's better. :)  Edit: I guess down voting is easier than providing a well thought out counter point."
CompanyOfHeroes,37uo48,velmarg,1 point,Sat May 30 20:00:38 2015 UTC,Is the damage/pen from the pak40 better than the ZiS?  Or is allied armor as a whole just weaker making the pak40 look stronger lol.

The German mortar performs better as the support weapon it is, but it's more fragile. You can apply this, on some level, to all infantry and support teams when comparing Soviets to Wehrmacht. It's literally the core balance principal the vCOH2 factions were built on.  If you can't comprehend THAT, it's because you need to learn to play."

Secondly, it is easy enough to tell the relative range of units after only a few games using them. Lastly, it would cover is stationary so in many cases, infantry especially, their range is often dictated by the cover available to them."
CompanyOfHeroes,37pu9c,DNA_LEVEL_C,3,Fri May 29 23:40:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a distraction or immersion breaking, especially if it's tied to a key.  Even having a sense of the units ranges, I would find it beneficial. If the circle could be drawn around the cursors position that would be ideal. You can then reliably position your vehicles. This is a really big deal for tanks and TDs since they have relatively slight differences in range, but that range difference is critical to gameplay.  Infantry do see the least benefit. Still, there's absolutely no downside to knowing your units max range. In fact, I'd say its very useful to help select the best cover or path for your infantry. Late game the map tends to be heavily cratered, providing large swaths of light cover to position your infantry in."

CompanyOfHeroes,37qoh2,oceanf,8,Fri May 29 17:03:00 2015 UTC,There should be a gun facing option key that replaces your movement drag with facing your turret. So for example alt plus right click hold and drag will face your turret without facing your tank.  The tank will ignore auto targeting but still fire at targets in its turrets line of fire (still using prioritize vehicles if available) until the turret is in place.  Then maybe add a lock turret position key that will just ignore auto targeting and only change turret facing when you manually tell it to

DoW2 has heores that can be upgraded, the resources in the two games are similar but different in unique ways. The combat is similar, but each game allows for its own style.   All in all DoW2 Retribution was a really fun game. It might look like CoH in space, but when you start to play it, you realize it is its own game.

CompanyOfHeroes,37ombc,Malaysia_flight_370,7,Fri May 29 05:27:56 2015 UTC,Yeah but there was some truth to it too. The fact that they left out a lot of the German stuff was bad
CompanyOfHeroes,37ombc,basedyonder,14,Fri May 29 04:58:17 2015 UTC,"It was pretty darn exaggerated if you ask me. Like when you are asked to set houses on fire with Soviet people still inside them. That's one hell of scorched earth. It also spends too much time on the ""we are not heroes, we are criminals!"" cliché. I kinda expected something more The People Immortal and less Life and Fate (even though Life and Fate is/was the better novel). They are supposed to be the protagonists after all.  Anyways, while the Soviets did commit various war crimes, the war for the Russian people was less of a ""World War"" where they were participant and more of a ""Patriotic War"" where they had to protect their homes so it's understandable it's a touchy subject for them and don't want to admit some of the stuff.  Nonetheless, the campaign is a very Enemy at the Gates/Hollywood trite thing. The Soviets were ill prepared and inexperienced when the war hit them, not incompetent as popular fiction sometimes paints them. Things like masses of human waves thrown at MGs until they had no bullets never happened, incidents like the one were Conscripts had no rifles happened only a couple of times and only because, again, they were ill prepared and inexperienced, not stupid.  Soviet Storm is a good and interesting documentary, while being produced for Russian audiences is actually pretty damn objective, telling how and why things happened, although it doesn't get in the ""touchy"" subjects too much.  Edit: Formatting.  Edit 2: Changed the link to the documentary to the official source."
CompanyOfHeroes,37ombc,basedyonder,2,Fri May 29 05:50:57 2015 UTC,There was definitely some hollywoodization going on there for sure. The Soviets gave the most blood for victory over Nazism. I just didn't hear about people panning a game they probably didn't play en masse on metacritic.

There were NKVD blocking squads shooting Russians at Stalingrad, there were many citations of Soviet commanders sending cucumbers (green helmet, fresh conscripts) to unceremonious and senseless deaths, for fear themselves of being killed by the NKVD. It was only as recent as 1939 that the officer corp lost nearly half its ranks in the purges, so the officers had a culture of following orders without question, much to the detriment of the survivability of those they commanded.  Stalinst Russia was a grim totalitarian fuck hole of extradition, racism, paranoia, fear, death, and starvation (mostly for the Ukrainians).

Sure a lot of what they displayed was somewhat based in fact, but in focusing on it it's misrepresentative of the war overall. It's like doing a German campaign where you play as SS in charge of rounding up the last Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto. A British campaign focusing on the bombing of Dresden or the persecution of Alan Turing post war for being a homosexual. Or a US campaign where segregated blacks are treated like shit.   Sure it happened, but would you base the campaign of a military RTS on it?

I think its important to shed light not just on war crimes, but really how fucking dire the situation was on the Eastern front. I watched Soviet Storm, and yes it was a little hyped up, but the brutality of it was plain to see in numbers alone. The Nazis were knocking on Moscows door, and whether you agree with Stalin's tactics or not, it did work. Sadly most Americans don't really understand the price Russia paid in WW2, most think the turning point was D-Day, and honestly I did too before my fascination of War history led me to the Eastern front war, and I'm a Canadian living in the US. I still speculate that Russia could have possibly won without any allied boots on the ground. You can't deny the momentum and sheer quantities of material they were bringing in by the time we (western allies) even set foot in Europe. War crimes existed on all sides, the allies killed millions of civilians with firebombing and carpet-bombing campaigns. I don't think the game tried to focus on the Soviets being ""Evil"" necessarily, but more focused the tactics they took, and how they thought it was necessary for their survival."
CompanyOfHeroes,37ombc,camperion,5,Fri May 29 19:04:24 2015 UTC,"The Nazis were knocking on Moscows door, and whether you agree with Stalin's tactics or not, it did work.   What Stalin's tactics of bringing fresh Siberian troops in just in time to save the situation? Troops who were highly trained in snow conditions (they were stationed in East most Russia), they pushed the German's back from Moscow's outskirts in a series of decisive engagements? He gambled that Japan wouldn't invade and it worked.  Oh no, sorry! Stalin threw wave after wave of Russian peasants to their death, let's not talk about it as a strategic success and a brave gamble, as that would be sympathetic to a Communist totalitarian regime.  In-game the entire Soviet campaign was based around a retired Sergeant being interrogated for cowardice as he recants the senseless slaughter of his men. How can that in any way shape or form be 'broad'. Every cut scene is him underplaying the patriotic and successful military aspects of the Great Patriotic War.  ""But at what cost?!?!?""  No typical Russian military man post Second World War screams ""at what cost?"" Nazi Germany wanted to annihilate Russia, it wasn't a conventional war, it was total war. If was win or die, and Soviet Russia defeated Nazi Germany in some of the greatest battles of all time. Why not focus on the battles and the tale of being pushed to their limit and finding the will and resources to fight back?  Do you know why? Because that would paint Soviet Russia as heroes, and western culture for the past 70 years has worked very hard at efficiently placing Soviet Russia as the enemy (and rightly so). But we're just not set up to view the war in an objective and fair way.  It's like a British ex RAF ommander depicted screaming ""at what cost!??!"" after the Second World War, no don't focus on RADAR and advanced tactics helping them win dog fights over Britain, focus on the bombings of Dresden and Caen."
CompanyOfHeroes,37ombc,DaTokzik,1 point,Fri May 29 22:10:14 2015 UTC,They didn't take a gamble that Japan wasn't going to attack they knew that Japan was fighting against the US in the pacific theater knowing full well that they could send all their troops to the western front.   I can almost certainly tell you that if Hitler would have focuses solely on taking out Russia and not attacking to the west *England he would have torn Russia apart possibly going all the way to China if not meeting up to Japan.

CompanyOfHeroes,37nfr8,windock,2,Fri May 29 13:06:15 2015 UTC,What irritates me the most about grid layout is R is both retreat and reverse there. So you cannot box vehicles and infantry and order infantry to retreat - you have to select only infantry.

CompanyOfHeroes,37na1c,MyCaG,1 point,Thu May 28 22:11:57 2015 UTC,*balance is much better in 1v1/2v2 than larger games
CompanyOfHeroes,37na1c,Ragman676,3,Fri May 29 18:47:37 2015 UTC,"3v3's are bearable with a decent team. 4v4's are pretty rough with the drops and non-stop shit-talking. Also late game tends to favor German armor. It just requires so much focus to take down the bigger endgame tanks, that if 3 or 4 people coordinate together they can pretty much smash through anything and start rolling your base."
CompanyOfHeroes,37na1c,Contaminator,3,Fri May 29 19:10:14 2015 UTC,"I have to say 1v1 is most balanced.   2v2 is also right up there but might have a point or two to complain about... who doesn't.  3v3 you start hitting trouble. The combo of problematic balancing in larger games and less than stellar maps is only exacerbated by frequently poor match making both for the enemy and for you, often leaving the axis the victors with multiple tags quit allies.  4v4 are an atrocious and foul swamp of rude, troll mouthed people spouting their hubris. Dominated by tactically inept players who prefer to use the least balanced units to a sheer absurdity which forces players to rely on commander abilities to alpha strike whole units out of the game. Enter at your own risk"

CompanyOfHeroes,37mnxb,Ragman676,3,Thu May 28 19:17:42 2015 UTC,"Yes. The answer is autohotkey. You can make a script to change your hotkeys.  Use it at your own risk. Though, there haven't been bans for using it and Relic doesn't seem to care about it, as far as I'm aware.  Edit: On your second question, it seems you are giving an attack order and leaving the Jackson to do its own thing. When a unit is given an attack order, it will continue to pursue if the unit gets out of attack range (which can happen if the unit moves behind a shot blocker, for example). What I normally do is give an attack-move order somewhere near my own troops, that way the Jackson will peek, fire a shot and, if its target gets out of range, it won't pursue very far."
CompanyOfHeroes,37mnxb,basedyonder,1 point,Thu May 28 19:25:52 2015 UTC,"Awesome, Yes I was attacking directly, I'm so used to other RTS having units engage at max range always, I guess the mechanic is a bit different here. Even a direct attack when I knew he was in range had him pulling up too close so I guess ill just attack move, which honestly should be even less micro in the long run. Thanks!"
CompanyOfHeroes,37mnxb,internet-arbiter,2,Thu May 28 20:39:59 2015 UTC,Vehicles also carry their momentum. A jackson will engage at max range but cutting off the engine has it roll forward still. Long range tank destroyers take a lil babying in that regard.
CompanyOfHeroes,37mnxb,trineroks,1 point,Fri May 29 05:33:38 2015 UTC,"Don't use the attack command. Your jackson will drive into enemy lines and get killed easily!   Just get used to pressing NUM0. I know its a pain but its easier then using 3rd party tools to change your hotkeys.  It used to be TAB in COH1 and that was easier, I felt.  The tatical map is very useful. Larger than the mini-map, its easier to see units. You can also select units using the tact map and give capture or attack commands. Very basic. Its best used to get a view of the larger battlefield and a broader view of unit compositions within vison."

CompanyOfHeroes,37mb3f,Ragman676,6,Thu May 28 17:46:49 2015 UTC,Teching grenades gets your riflemen arguably the best smoke grenade in the game.  MGs cant shoot you if they cant see you!
CompanyOfHeroes,37mb3f,iTzDusty,5,Thu May 28 18:04:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, tech grenades and become batman. Walk into smoke, throw grenade, and disappear with a squad wipe"
CompanyOfHeroes,37mb3f,christobevii3,1 point,Thu May 28 19:08:44 2015 UTC,how do you use the smokes effectively
CompanyOfHeroes,37mb3f,ronniesan,2,Fri May 29 19:15:52 2015 UTC,"Since the smoke grenade is shot from the rifle, it basically leaves a full trail behind it. So, literally just shoot it at the MG."
CompanyOfHeroes,37mb3f,iTzDusty,5,Fri May 29 19:24:24 2015 UTC,"Smoke, smoke, and more smoke. Smoke grenades are your friend. If they're legitimately spamming MG's their map control probably wont be as good as it could be, so that 15 fuel into teching grenades is worth it."
CompanyOfHeroes,37mb3f,Cuddles1612,3,Thu May 28 18:10:06 2015 UTC,"The obvious answer is always flanking, by simply attacking from two different sides simultaneously you can get past an MG's arc of fire. This, however, can be difficult if your opponent has many overlapping MGs. In that case you should know that his forces won't be nowhere near as mobile as your forces, take advantage of that and attack somewhere else.   Don't try to force the issue with a frontal attack. If you are forced to fight MGs, do it from green cover, as it greatly reduces suppression and you can cause serious damage to an MG that way.   Try garrisoning key buildings (near cutoffs or near your opponent's base, like the west most building in Kholodny Ferma too, OH and OKW (especially OKW) have troubles dealing with garrisoned units, you can stall them by having a single Rifleman squad in a key building, use that time to flank your opponent. Just be aware of that unit's health and switch it for a fresh squad if it gets too low, also be careful of flamethrowers and mortars.   It seems to take forever for USF to get up to the lieutenant tech tree, especially if you tech nades early.   I wouldn't recommend teching for grenades until you get your Lt. However, once you get grenades, remember you get access to smoke, your best tool for dealing with MGs."
CompanyOfHeroes,37mb3f,basedyonder,3,Thu May 28 18:10:03 2015 UTC,"WC51 truck is good vs. Kubels, be careful not to lose it though. 3-4 riflemen is the norm opening for USF. Obviously if they have a strong garrison you need more squads to engage and one heavy machine gun can't pin all your squads. Try to avoid approaching them until you have an advantage in numbers or a good flank. Armor and Rifle companies have access to flamers.  And as always, play as every faction to get a good feel on the weaknesses and strengths. Spamming any one unit is liable to counter-play."

CompanyOfHeroes,37mb3f,thefonztm,1 point,Thu May 28 19:03:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, use smoke.  Additionally, split your riflemen up. Don't send two squads into MG fire. Send one into cover to make MG fire, send the second to flank and toss a grenade!"
CompanyOfHeroes,37mb3f,Suljik,1 point,Thu May 28 20:18:48 2015 UTC,"In addition to smoke, you may find zooks useful if the kubels (the MG cars) are giving you trouble. Stick a zook or two on your RETs and have them follow your rifles around.  Zooks also make short work of bunkers (and even HQs!) if you are running into MG bunker spam."
CompanyOfHeroes,37mb3f,TheLuftwaffle,1 point,Fri May 29 13:42:47 2015 UTC,"As an alternative to grenades, which I rarely purchase due to my goal of a 11-12 min Sherman, if you are already going LT tech, I find an M20 to be quite useful against MGs, and especially kubels.   If you support it with rifles, you can drive it around and then right into the face of an MG giving you trouble, forcing a retreat or displace. And it chases down kubels like no-one's business"

Now, being that he's green and a complete rookie, I believe that there is a chance that he embellished the story of how the crew was taken out. Perhaps what happened in reality is he managed to hide while the rest of the crew got shrekt while fighting and lived to tell the tale.   For all we know, he glorified the battle and what occured and it is his story that the movie is telling.  I might be reaching a bit far here, but it's a possibility.

Turns out what I've been calling the pak 37 is actually the pak 36 which shoots a 37mm shell. Heh, wonder how long I've been making that mistake.  More fun facts from my wiki diving:   As the Pak 36 was gradually replaced, many were removed from their carriages and added to SdKfz 251 halftracks for use as light anti-armour support. The guns were also passed off to the forces of Germany's allies fighting on the Eastern Front, such as the 3rd and 4th Romanian Army. This proved particularly disastrous during the Soviet encirclement (Operation Uranus) at the Battle of Stalingrad when the Romanian forces, already demoralized and understrength, bore the brunt of the main Soviet armored thrust, and were unable to stop the Soviet advances due to their grossly inadequate anti-tank weaponry. The Pak 36 also served with the armies of Italy,[3] Finland, Hungary, and Slovakia."

CompanyOfHeroes,37jagh,thefonztm,2,Thu May 28 11:23:48 2015 UTC,It could then get a higher penetration chance when firing at frontal armour to simulate those few shots that could do damage while firing from the side.

Historically speaking the M42 had a penetration of 61mm of armor, while the panther only had 40mm (46mm accounting for the angle)  of armor on the sides and back. Game balance-wise who knows though"
CompanyOfHeroes,37jagh,thefonztm,1 point,Thu May 28 16:40:59 2015 UTC,61 mm at what range? Then scale the range down by a factor of 100 because CoH. I'm willing to bet that you'd need to be 'shock trooper close' game wise to get that 61mm penetration.

CompanyOfHeroes,37j3c9,madmike577,4,Thu May 28 00:16:44 2015 UTC,"Of course strategy guides and videos help, but you also need to learn how to spread your attention across the battlefield and avoid the ""tunnel vision"" syndrome that so many newcomer RTS players suffer from. As traditional RTSes such as Company of Heroes naturally have their camera close to the battlefield, you can't help but settle into a sort of ""tunnel vision"" state. You have to actively try to break this. Also, boosting your micro never hurts (and is extremely beneficial in a game like this).  What I mean is, force yourself to utilize and get accustomed to the mechanics in CoH 2.     Make it a habit to glance at the top right of your screen to see which units are being torn apart and which units are sitting at base idle.  Use control groups (Ctrl+#) for units on the battlefield so that you can easily double tap their number to select and snap the camera to their position. Get comfortable with using the hotkeys for abilities rather than clicking on the button itself. F1-F4 to select your base buildings as well (F1 = HQ, F2 = T1 structure, F3 = T2 structure, F4 = T3 structure). Spacebar will snap your camera to the latest alert. If you hear a unit screaming over the radio that they're taking heavy enemy fire, tapping the spacebar will bring your camera to the unit in question. Although this is sometimes useful, I find myself favoring the top right unit shields and the tactical map to gain awareness of the battlefield. Hop into the tactical map (Numpad 0) at least once a minute to take in an overview of what's going on, what units are where, etc. You can also order units around and assign unit groups in the tactical map. I personally use the tactical map to take a look at the overall situation, select all my infantry back at base (who've retreated), exit the tactical map, and reinforce them without having to move my camera away from where I was looking at before. Use RTS macro keys - ""Shift"" is a great utensil present in most RTSes that allow you to queue actions, include/exclude units in a group, etc.    For example, if I see a group of engineers standing in a square formation on a road, I can pretty accurately deduce they laid mines there. If you order them to lay mines and then queue a move order away from there, your engineers will lay the mines and then walk away, thus not betraying the fact that you laid mines there. Or in the opening game, you can queue control point captures by shift+right clicking the points in succession - your units will capture and automatically move on to the next point. You cannot possibly be expected to be everywhere at once, so shift queue-ing lets you queue orders to a unit while you can focus on another point in the battlefield. Shift can also be used to include/exclude units in a group. If I have a unit selected and then shift click on another unit, I will add that unit to my currently selected group. If I have a group of units selected and shift click on a unit who is a part of that group, that unit will be excluded from the group. This is extremely helpful when you have a bunch of retreated infantry back at base - if there's injured infantry units mingled among reinforced and healed troops, it would be a bit of a pain to have to sift through each one of them. Instead, select the entire group and shift exclude the injured units, leaving you the fully reinforced ones. You can also do this with unit groups - if I have unit group ""1"" selected and shift+2 (assuming you have a unit group 2), the units in unit group ""2"" will be included in the group selection. EDIT: Also something that I don't see a lot of players realizing - you can queue retreat orders as well. Say you have an engineer out on the field that you want to string up barbed wire and then have back at base to build a structure - you can order the barbed wire and shift + retreat, which will make your engineers automatically retreat as soon as they're finished setting up the wire.  ""Tab"" is a great key to iterate through selected units - for example, if I have 2x Conscripts and 1x T-34 selected in a group, pressing ""Tab"" once will select the first Conscript squad, pressing it again will select the second Conscript squad, pressing it a third time will select the T-34, and pressing it one more time will select the entire group.   Extremely important when you want to split orders - so many players (new and veteran) I've seen will manually select an MG squad, position it, then move the camera over to select the infantry squad and give it orders. Instead, have both the MG and infantry squad selected. Press ""Tab"" to focus on the MG, position it, then press ""Tab"" again to focus on the infantry squad to issue it orders without having to affect the MG's orders. Also very helpful for spreading out infantry - infantry blobs can and will be wiped out by single artillery shots. If you have a group of infantry, ""Tab"" through each one of them and spread out their move orders so that the enemy will have a hard time trying to counter them.    I started out pretty bad, but since I came from Starcraft I at least knew some of the basics. What I did then was play a few matches, and while playing them I would force myself to apply at least ONE of the above mechanics in a match - when I got comfortable with it, I would apply the next mechanic.  There are a lot of guides out there that teach you strategy and tactics which is great and all, but those guides are pretty much useless when you can't get your focus spread across the map. Oftentimes the issue isn't that players have bad ideas/strategy - it's there, but the ability to multitask on the battlefield isn't.  EDIT: Play against human opponents as much as you can. I got flamed quite a bit when I first started out vCoH, but everyone trying to get better will likely go through this phase."
CompanyOfHeroes,37j3c9,trineroks,3,Thu May 28 04:43:03 2015 UTC,Thank you for this.
CompanyOfHeroes,37j3c9,JenkinsEar147,2,Thu May 28 10:12:10 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks so much! I did not know most of this, so I will be referring back to this plenty!  I always find myself paying attention to one area where more action is going on and more of my units are, yet don't switch back to my other guys that could be advancing and playing more aggressively, which would really help myself I think. I already bind my first 5-6 units with Ctrl and look at the top left, but after one dies or I send a few back, it becomes a mess and I do not continue to do it. I have mistakenly entered the tactical view, but I did not think it could be as useful as it is. I think if I can try to do that at least once a minute as you said, that would help give me a sense of what is going on all over the map. Spacebar, F1 hotkeys, both things I never use, yet I am sure will help me greatly.  I did not know any of the shift information, I will start using that immediately! I always find myself spending more time than I should on moving units to points to take, having engis build a building and then do nothing, or selecting the units at base are healed and ready manually apart from the injured ones.    those guides are pretty much useless when you can't get your focus spread across the map. Oftentimes the issue isn't that players have bad ideas/strategy - it's there, but the ability to multitask on the battlefield isn't.   My friend will be happy to read this, as he is always telling me it does not matter if I know a strategy or not, if I do not know the basics of the game and how to utilize the hotkeys you mentioned, there is no point. Thanks for also pointing me in what is looking to be the right direction. I come from playing MOBAs and Counter Strike, so my reaction times are better than my micro, but I am sure with practice I will improve. Thank you so much for this once again!"
CompanyOfHeroes,37j3c9,Waylander0719,1 point,Thu May 28 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"MOBA map awareness will translate over well. Also don't discount reaction time, That half second can be the difference between them getting another AT shot off or your tank getting away.  Also learn how to use attack group to hit tanks etc that are out of line of site."
CompanyOfHeroes,37j3c9,trineroks,1 point,Thu May 28 20:05:55 2015 UTC,"No problem mate. It's just that I've noticed so many people delving into abstract concepts such as strategy/counters but never cover the practical aspects that make applying said strategies much easier.   It'll probably take some time to be fully comfortable with and utilize all the tools at your disposal, which is why I recommend focusing on using one of the above mechanics until you get comfortable with it before you apply the next. Iterate upon each mechanic (maybe for your first few games you'll use the shift key often so that it becomes second nature, and then the next few games you'll frequently use the tactical map in addition to the shift key, etc) and you'll get the hang of it in no time.   Cheers for the gold, btw!"
CompanyOfHeroes,37j3c9,Waylander0719,1 point,Thu May 28 21:28:34 2015 UTC,"Another point to add onto ""Shift""  If you tell a unit to walk to a location, like a capture point, they will take the most direct route on the ground. However if there is a giant fence in the way that they would be able to vault over they will walk around the fence instead. If you Shift click an order onto the fence first then to the point it will cause them to vault then walk directly there, this can make a huge difference in how quick you can get to a point and setup.  This can also be used to setup a fence hop before retreat, allowing for a clear retreat path instead of one that takes an odd route through enemy lines."

I suggest watching one video, try to use what you saw, then play a game and watch your replay and look for where you made mistakes, then repeat.  Like most RTS games having an innate knowledge of what your opponent can do, will probably do, what times things will happen, and whatnot are gained through study and practice.  I'm nothing special but I just innately know when my opponent will probably get a vehicle and I should get anti-vehicle stuff based on what I am seeing or what time it is.    Also get in the habit of good mine use now.  The computer AI is a cheating bastard and doesn't seem to lose a lot of models to Soviet mines but in real games hitting a soviet mine really sucks.  Also at vet 1 conscripts get a trip wire flare that is cheap and easy to spam.  I think it always kills the infantry model that sets it off and at 10 muni that is a good deal especially against Ostheer since if their squads lose a man that is usually 1/4 of that squads dps gone.  I still forget that I should be laying mines when the action stops.  Mines win games though."

There are so many tips that I could give, but I'll try and keep it short.   Are you using your resources when they're available? You should always be looking for the next thing to build, or the next building to tech-up to. This can be hard during hectic battles, but if you end up having like 1000 manpower, then you're just not spending your resources quickly enough. If your opponents are teching up before you, you might not be managing your fuel well. Capturing fuel points is often much more important than taking victory points at the beginning.  When you're still improving, I would suggest focusing on taking and dominating a certain part of the map. This will allow you to keep your forces together, and you'll have less trouble keeping track of them. If you spread your forces too thin, you'll lose every engagement, and quickly fall behind.   Try and think of a plan for the match. A decent goal is to capture the fuel and victory point on one side, while teching quickly to T34s. Having that plan will make it easier to know what to focus on and what to ignore, and will help you plan how to use your fuel.   In games like CoH2, certain units counter other units. But I'm convinced that the way you use them is much more important than what you have. But by the mid game, you need to have counters to infantry, vehicles, and indirect fire (mortars and artillery)... so plan ahead.  Good luck! Let us know if there is anything specific we can help with. If you post a replay, I'll try and check it out."
CompanyOfHeroes,37j3c9,basedyonder,1 point,Thu May 28 08:37:17 2015 UTC,"Whenever I play, I always have the highest resource float. I usually value fuel and munitions higher than VPs at the start, or even try to cut off the enemy side fuel first. I usually have 1 side to take care of in 2v2s, the one that is easiest to hold, and then I will help with the middle point as well. I usually build a few conscripts, get an mg, a mortar, and even a scout car with flamethrower engis too. Breaking things down will be my best bet, and working on 1 thing at a time. Thanks for the advice! We will see if I am brave enough to post a replay! :) Probably from my next 2v2 with my friend."

CompanyOfHeroes,37k0vs,Katter,2,Thu May 28 08:46:39 2015 UTC,There is normal engine damage where you can still back up at a acceptable speed and then there is heavy damage where the tanks is basically a brick.

CompanyOfHeroes,37ix3s,nicksam112,3,Thu May 28 01:28:28 2015 UTC,"Nope, same core gameplay as CoH. Just that you had 8 slots for army items that were similar to what bulletins are in CoH 2 (though made a much larger difference, some did things like replacing engineer smgs with rifles for example) and also having slots for hero units that didn't receive normal veterancy, but had their own perks (like starting with BARs and Elite armour in the case of Gladiator Riflemen).  You also were locked into a single commander/doctrine per ""character"" or ""toon"" that you leveled up after each game , and the commander was heavily customizable. For example, once you hit level 50 with a toon/commander and had all your skill points available, your Blitzkrieg character could have stormtroopers, a triple repeating rocket artilery call in, a customizable mechanized assault group (that depending on skill points came with StuGs, Pumas, or StuHs from what I remember), and many other abilities. You could choose 5 or 6 abilities IIRC, but there were 8 or so to choose from, so everyone generally had a different build of each doctrine."

The combat group is nice and gives you a bargain on the troops you receive for it compared to their actual cost, but floating 900 manpower is pretty hard to do and if you are floating that much you're probably better off buying a tank or two.

Also nice to supplement a base stomp force with and take out infantry, its got a nice rate of fire and is better at fighting light armor than a utility car or AA HT  recon overflight helps make a strat, let your allies overflight is coming.  Combat group drop is nice to help finish up a base with. Also better to have airborne on the field instead of rifles late game as combat units. They drop with LMG's, subMGs or Bazookas.

CompanyOfHeroes,37gubi,spajn,2,Wed May 27 16:04:36 2015 UTC,TIL artillery operates best if used for direct fire... That's not counter intuitive at all...  Just like all the times my M8's decide they can't shoot over a bush... Or whatever they do when they ignore in range infantry...
CompanyOfHeroes,37gubi,Ragman676,2,Wed May 27 16:11:07 2015 UTC,"So I've don't play as Axis, pretty much only USA, and its painfully frustrating dealing with mortars early game when you have nothing to counter other than trying to flank. Honestly the barrage ability on the Pack-H is damn near useless, maybe as a scare tactic only to cause the other guy to micro/move his troops around. Now I've had luck getting a forward Pathfinder in a sweet spot. They cloak when in cover, so sometimes you can even crawl through MG fire and have them hold fire and stay in cover as a forward observer. The Pack getting a direct hit is devastating and totally negates blob tactics and can wipe multiple squads if used correctly, and this is where it really shines. Its range and damage is nuts, but its slow as hell and needs tons of support. Riflemen constantly popping flares can really up the DPS too, its all about getting that sweet vision and you'll watch your Pack start firing on everything. If you can draw the enemy into a blob on blob war you can surprise him and gain the upper hand with literally one shot. I tend to lean towards the Howitzer motor carriage a little more, but the downside is you use the valuable fuel you need for Jacksons, and a vetted Jackson with AP rounds are pretty crucial against Axis late game. The Howitzer carriage is really nice though because its fast as hell and can run from almost anything though I don't think you get the same range as the Pack-H. I haven't confirmed that though so I may be wrong.   EDIT: Reading other comments, I haven't tried indirect fire with a vetted Pack-H and it sounds like they might be much better then."
CompanyOfHeroes,37gubi,TowerMasterTom,1 point,Wed May 27 18:37:58 2015 UTC,"Well you have to remember, the ability for a unit to fire directly or indirectly was brand new when the armies came out. Treat them less like mortars and more like tank turrets on wheels. Maybe a mortar that fires like an AT gun?  Play around with its ability to switch firing types.

Forget about the barrage with the ISG (unless you don't have direct targets and you need to hit something specifically behind a shot blocker). The AT barrage is useless.  Regarding the Pack Howie, only at vet2 you gain better shells while using the barrage. Although at this level the barrage is insane (as it used to be)."
CompanyOfHeroes,37gubi,basedyonder,1 point,Wed May 27 18:10:37 2015 UTC,"I second this. At vet 0/1 you need LOS for it to be effective and then it can be very useful with its increased accuracy. At vet 1 it gains the WP incendiary/smoke ability which is very effective at denying points/forcing enemy AT guns and MGs to pull back while covering your advance.   The pack howitzer's utility actually changes drastically at vet 2 and vet 3.   At vet 2 it will get a huge range boost and fire HE shells which have a very large AOE and makes the normal barrage ability very effective.  At vet 3 it will fire HEAT shells which have a smaller AOE but will penetrate a King Tiger reliably from the front. It outranges most tanks so you can use it as a very effective AT gun if you remember to micro it away from an enemy advance, or use its absurd range and damage to hammer OKW base buildings/forward positions of your enemy. The barrage is still effective though you'll probably miss 2-3 shells."
CompanyOfHeroes,37gubi,November_One,2,Thu May 28 05:45:02 2015 UTC,"You should NEVER use them as a mortar. They should always have direct fire on their targets, this gives them a HUGE bonus to accuracy, rate of fire and the time on target of the shells.  Most people have them sit behind a building or, like you said, they just park them next to a truck and forget about them. Don't do that, direct fire makes them a lot better.  Even though, both units aren't really that good, I always feel you need at least two of them in direct fire mode to be a reliable source of damage/suppression and, even then, they can't keep up with 120 mm mortars.  One final thing, I've always felt that the Pack Howitzer is the better one of the two: its better AoE synergies well with the new suppression mechanic."
CompanyOfHeroes,37gubi,Mandarion,1 point,Wed May 27 18:19:48 2015 UTC,The isg seems to perfom better in the accuracy department when it has a line of sight on the target.
CompanyOfHeroes,37gubi,anon4773,1 point,Wed May 27 15:47:03 2015 UTC,"That's because it has two firing modes, direct and indirect fire. The latter one has a much higher time-on-target, meaning that the shot will take much longer to reach the target. This in turn means that the target has more time to move away, making the shot miss.  The same is true for the Pack Howitzer by the way. If you want those weapons to be effective, don't keep sight blockers between them and your target. This is of course a much more dangerous proposition for the l.IG, because it only has a four model crew and thus is de-crewed much easier."
CompanyOfHeroes,37gubi,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,1 point,Wed May 27 16:33:39 2015 UTC,Micro.  Unless you are doing large team games you have to constantly micro IDF weapons so that they are in range and actually firing.  They seem to find any excuse to not fire.
CompanyOfHeroes,37gubi,Contaminator,1 point,Wed May 27 18:32:05 2015 UTC,"You don't. They're expensive indirect fire units that heavily rely on RNG. This makes them a total gamble for the huge manpower investment required to get one. As other players have said, they basically require direct line of sight, which is another negative in comparison to mortars. Even the epic 120mm mortars squad wipers are cheaper. Totally broken IMO."
CompanyOfHeroes,37dof3,Ragman676,6,Tue May 26 21:37:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of Airborne as well!  To me, I actually enjoy the fact weapon teams aren't crewed on drop. the way I see it is if they WERE crewed, you wouldn't ever really need to plan ahead. It's basically an AT gun (or MG) with no tech requirements, no build time, and can be placed anywhere. A little bit broken. But if you think about it, not being crewed has some positive aspects to it. Use your pathfinders to crew them and you have a weapon team with the same view range as pathfinders."
CompanyOfHeroes,37dof3,TowerMasterTom,3,Tue May 26 22:05:26 2015 UTC,"Idk, I tend to just use RE's to crew them. I almost always have a unit in front of my support weapons anyways so it's cheaper to reinforce."

CompanyOfHeroes,37dof3,Katter,5,Fri May 29 09:17:15 2015 UTC,"I do really like Airborne, but it can cause some weird army balance issues. Usually, I could afford like 3 riflemen before I am able to get Pathfinders, but if I buy that many, my army will be much too infantry based by the time I get Pathfinders and Paratroopers. So I usually try and hold out with fewer riflemen. But then it is hard to control the early game. I haven't find a very good solution to this, and usually end up too infantry heavy unless some of my squads get wiped.   Question: Do you guys actually drop behind enemy lines? I almost always just drop somewhere safe."
CompanyOfHeroes,37dof3,damnmonk,2,Wed May 27 06:11:04 2015 UTC,"Try replacing the third riflemen with a Rear Echelon, they drain your manpower less. With the extra manpower, get a fighting position up somewhere.  If you'll be relying mostly on infantry, you'll need every bit of cover you can get, so keep your Rear Echelon squads busy building tank traps. If they survive later on, equip them with bazookas.   Ideally you'll have 2xRE, 2 Riflemen, 1 LT/Capt., (1xpathfinder), 2x Paratroopers.  I'll drop behind enemy lines if I can secure a panzershreck or an LMG."
CompanyOfHeroes,37dof3,Dedow,1 point,Wed May 27 14:41:44 2015 UTC,"Standard Airbourne build is 3 Riflemen into LT, then you still have map presence because of LT but you wont bleed so you can still get Para's and Pathfinders."
CompanyOfHeroes,37dof3,Katter,3,Wed May 27 08:35:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  I still feel like that leaves you with just so much infantry. If you don't get squad wiped, you'll have 1 RE+3 Riflemen+ 1 LT + 1 Pathfinder + 1 Para. That's 7 infantry, and that's only if you don't get more paratroopers. And with those units, your army has no indirect fire, and no suppression (although can paratroopers suppress with an ability?). It just always feels bloated with infantry, so even if you play well and don't bleed manpower, your manpower income is still pretty low, and these units don't scale well into the late game anyway.   I find that with the other factions (and other USF commanders) it is easier to keep a lean but effective army. Even though the Soviets who more commonly have swarms of infantry, you can always recycle your conscripts via Merge."
CompanyOfHeroes,37dof3,nicksam112,3,Wed May 27 09:03:51 2015 UTC,"You really can't go wrong with airborne. Just my two cents but I like to crew weapons with the pathfinder squads if possible, that extra sight gives weapons like the AT gun a nice extra edge.   Or, if that's not your style, try giving them bars. They will wreck with those especially with their crit sniper."

CompanyOfHeroes,37d3wk,yoyo20011,24,Tue May 26 19:20:16 2015 UTC,"Company of Heroes Family  Company of Heroes is the first ""game"" in the group, but as many of the games in the series are standalone expansions, I've broken them into ""families"" of games that share multiplayer. Company of Heroes is an action-oriented squad-based RTS with a strong emphasis on tactics, positioning, and map control over macro and resourcing (which is map control anyway). The original CoH family holds up very well graphically, but the multiplayer populations is definitely down from its peak and largely populated by diehards. As excellent as the game is, the engine is a bit wonky in places-- cover cannot be vaulted, tank shots can bend (complicated-- I'll explain if you really care), garrisoning buildings is shit, and it's mechanically so unbelievably complicated that you're unlikely to want to devote the time to learning the mechanical underpinnings unless you're pretty obsessed.  Company of Heroes  The original. Features one of the strongest campaigns and the two best-designed factions of the series (Americans and Wehrmacht). This is the standard to which all the entries in the series are compared. While the factions are excellent, they were balanced against one another in 1v1 and 2v2, and the entire multiplayer ecosystem in CoH1 is absolute anarchy in 3v3 and 4v4 games. Unfortunately, 3v3 and 4v4 games are the most popular. Thankfully, 1v1 games remain sublime-- mechanics like purchased veterancy and medic bunkers are cancer in large games, but excellent in 1v1.  Opposing Fronts  OF is a standalone expansion to ""vanilla"" CoH (often called ""vCoH"") that adds two additional factions: the British and the Panzer Elite. The British emphasize emplacements, slit trenches, and officers; the Panzer Elite focus on a semi-historical (less so than the original factions) version of mechanized infantry, with an emphasis on halftracks, mobility, elite infantry, and late game breakthrough tanks. Both of these factions are interesting but problematic for multiplayer balance, and skew even farther from realism than the already-tenuous grasp that the original factions had. OF also includes a campaign that I found solid but uninspired.  Tales of Valor  ToV is a standalone expansion that unlocks all four factions in the CoH family for use in multiplayer, and has several riffs on the standard campaign structure. I enjoyed the mini-campaigns, but the real get here is the replacement units. Each faction gets a few ""replacement"" units that they can select before the battle: a Schwimwagen (amphibious jeep vehicle) can replace the Wehrmacht motorbike, for example. While these units are in line at the moment, for the most part, they've historically been disruptive to the multiplayer metagame. ToV also includes a selection of multiplayer modes that no one plays, including a pretty shitty attempt at CoH Dota.  Company of Heroes 2 Family  Company of Heroes 2 is the newest full game in the series. It primarily serves two purposes: one, to patch up the aging vCoH engine; and two, to rectify the incredible omission of the Soviet Union from the original game and expansions. We'll get to factions with each game, but there are a few things that affect the whole franchise. First, the positives. Vaulting over cover and True Sight (fog of war that rolls back based on what your squads can actually see, not just a circle) are the banner upgrades here, and while they sound minor, in a tactical RTS with such an emphasis on positioning, they're game changers. Unfortunately, CoH2 also introduced winter mechanics (thankfully almost wholly optional in multiplayer these days) and failed to resolve some major engine quirks (garrison facing, bendy bullets, weird pathfinding on retreat, etc). Almost certainly the worst ""innovation"" was the new Commander and Bulletin model, which currently features a drop system and paid Commanders. Rather than the three double trees available to each side in vCoH, you can equip three commanders and choose one in the fight. Each commander is a set of passives, abilities, and units that unlock as the game progresses, but it's entirely linear and you cannot choose as in the first game. The drop system has reduced some of these concerns, but you'll still be playing against people using units you don't have access to.  Company of Heroes 2  Introduced two new factions, Soviets and a hot new Wehrmacht. These factions are pretty solid; they're not vCoH Wehr/Americans, but they're fairly well balanced, distinct, and fun to play. The campaign is similar to OF: good, not inspired, takes too much influence from Hollywood rather than doing justice to the Eastern Front.  Western Fronts Armies  This is a DLC that introduces two new factions (that can be purchased separately if you want) to multiplayer. I don't think there's a campaign, but I haven't tried it if there is. Anyway, adds the Americans and the Oberkommando West. Americans are versatile; they can pop crews out of vehicles and have a unique weapon purchase system for their excellent Riflemen squads. They're a challenge in the late game, as they lack any heavy armor at all and must rely on the jack-of-all-trades Sherman medium tanks supplemented by AT guns and tank destroyers. Opposing them is the Oberkommando West, a faction similar to the Panzer Elite from the first game in that they're inspired by historical formations but only loosely based on them. These guys are an attempt at a ""fixed"" British faction, and they can produce bases anywhere on the map and protect them with variable quality troops armed with excellent weaponry. Their armor situation is... weird. Effective general purpose tanks are thin, but their specialist tanks are excellent. Despite the erratic quality of the actual soldiers they have access to (ranging from awful to excellent), the OKW has easy access to both the StG44 (the best assault rifle in the game) and the LMG42 (an upgrade to an already amazing squad). They're not to be fucked with in infantry combat.  Ardennes Assault  Singleplayer campaign with persistent units for CoH2, focusing on the Ardennes offensive (better known as the Battle of the Bulge or Operation Watch on the Rhine). Haven't played it, heard good things, though. No effect on MP at all.  Random DLC  CoH2 was developed under the auspices of a dying THQ, who felt that an aggressive microtransaction strategy could increase the revenue from CoH2. Traces of this legacy persist in the Commander structure, as well as camo, decals, and other cosmetic options. Of these, only Commanders affect gameplay in a measurable way. CoH2 now features a drop system called ""War Spoils"" that randomly drops new skins, decals, and commanders, but it's very unreliable if you're looking for a specific commander as there's no trading or crafting system, nor anything to do with duplicates. If you find yourself desiring a specific commander after playing a while, it may be worthwhile to purchase if you feel comfortable supporting their business model. Watch out, though: many early commanders are simple reshuffles of existing units and abilities. Those are simply not worth the price of admission in most cases. Stock commanders are more than serviceable, though, and get used heavily in high-level play. You're not directly gimping yourself if you don't have all Commanders, although obviously the best way to learn to counter a strategy is to try it yourself and see how it gets beaten, which the Commander system makes very, very hard."
CompanyOfHeroes,37d3wk,troglodyte,1 point,Tue May 26 19:57:00 2015 UTC,Thank you for this useful information. Please go more in detail about bendy tank shots and commanders.
CompanyOfHeroes,37d3wk,troglodyte,13,Tue May 26 20:17:04 2015 UTC,"There are two primary classes of ballistic weapons in the CoH series.  The most common are probably best classed as ""small arms."" These are MGs, assault rifles, rifles, pistols, and submachine guns. These weapons have accuracy characteristics at various ranges, which are weighed against cover and the targeted unit. A weapon at long range against a vetted, elite unit in cover will be far less accurate and take longer to aim than against a new, crappy squad standing in the road. These weapons often animate tracers, but they're cosmetic. It just rolls to hit based on modifiers, end of story.  The second common class of guns are ""ballistic"" weapons. Obviously all weapons are ballistic, but these actually have some degree of physics modeling. Basically, they roll to hit the same way that small arms do, but if they miss, they still fire the projectile. It fires in a small cone defined by the ""scatter"" stat. On a calculated miss, a shot can still ""scatter"" into the target. Unfortunately, the game was designed to be fun to watch, so tank shells are far slower than in real life, so that you can see them. If a tank or AT gun calculates a hit against a target moving perpendicular to the axis of the gun, often the result is that the animation is fudged to bend the shot in to make it hit. It doesn't affect the gameplay-- it was a hit anyway-- but it's weird and immersion breaking.  There are also explosives and flamethrowers and strafing runs and sniper rifles, but those are really beyond the scope of a quick comment.  As for Commanders, each one comes with five... let's call them ""perks."" These can be abilities, passive upgrades, or units. For example, the Soviet Shock Army Commander has these abilities:   Shock Troops. Active. Call in elite antipersonnel troops. 120mm Mortar. Active. Call in a large-caliber mortar squad. Conscript Assault Package. Passive. Conscripts can spend Munitions to buy PPsH SMGs. 152mm Howitzer. Passive. Your Combat Engineers can construct a 152mm Howitzer for indirect fire support. IL-2 Strafing Run. Active. Spend munitions to call in an IL-2 to strafe targets.   You can see that it has five abilities, of varying types. Unit call-ins cost resources, but they build instantly, do not require structures, and cannot be obtained without a Commander that provides access. Passives often provide the opportunity to build something or buy an upgrade, and Active Abilities are usually strafing runs, bomb drops, or artillery barrages. Each one is earned at different ""Commander Experience Levels"" in a round based on their power-- the IL-2 will only come into play late in the game, but a few skirmishes will have you fielding Shock Troops.  The sticky part is when a great perk is locked behind a paywall or improbable-drop-wall. For example, Shock Troops are pure antipersonnel assault troops with exceptional toughness, great short range power, and both a frag and smoke grenade (the smoke helps them close). While they're situational, they're super fucking relevant when you do need them. Thankfully, they're in a free commander, but plenty of units aren't, and you never know how the metagame will skew. The game has moved through cycles where overpowered units were pretty pay-to-play, although this has been trending down pretty much from the get-go and it's much fairer now.  This is in contrast to the CoH1 model, which features three options per faction, with two branches in each option. For example, Americans have the Airborne tree. One side features units, the other side abilities. Each has a point cost, and points are earned through combat. This opens up more options, as you can buy something in the right tree, then jump to the left. In the example of Airborne, maybe you just want Paratroopers now but access to abilities later, so you unlock Paras on the left tree first, and then work down the right tree to get scouting run and strafing run."

CompanyOfHeroes,37avcx,Ragman676,2,Wed May 27 18:47:33 2015 UTC,"This experience, and the many times I have had the same problem with pz4s is why I would like a hold fire option on pretty much all tanks or units.   I think the key reason why the SU player bounced an absurd amount of shots was that his tanks took way too many while moving. I would think that if his t34s have hold fire on during a couple of their advances, then opened fire when stationary rather than needing to wait for a reload once stationary, allowing the tiger to back up and lower the pen chance, the play would have had a much higher likelihood to succeed.  Far too often do I fall prey to is2s or jacksons that I flank perfectly fine getting a solid rear facing position to only have had my pz4s miss or bounce shots during the approach forcing them to sit and reload melee range allowing for the enemy tank to get a free penning shot off and proceed to turn frontal armor to me and retreat.  hashtag universalholdfirecommandrelicpls"

You cannot get it faster than an AC comes, but you can try to mostly avoid the AC until you get the M8. The PE problem is that it's hard for him to counter the M8 with T3.  But I have had a lot of success going fast BARs versus PE. The PE AC is a heavy hitter, but it really has crap for armor. BAR Riflemen in green cover have good survivability vs the AC, and will do damage if it closes in. Two BAR squads should cause the AC to run. Given the difficulties PE has with repairing vehicles, BARs are a very good stopgap measure against ACs until you get your own AT gun / M8 / Rangers.  I wouldn't get a WSC just to counter the AC, but if you're planning a WSC anyway, then the .30 cal HMG does a good job."
CompanyOfHeroes,378l16,CreepyOctopus,1 point,Mon May 25 20:00:34 2015 UTC,difficulties PE has with repairing vehicles   you mean how their entire army can perform repairs?
CompanyOfHeroes,378l16,redditors_r_manginas,1 point,Wed May 27 20:33:11 2015 UTC,"Very slowly until they research Advanced Repairs. To repair half the damage to an AC, PE loses a not-insignificant amount of capping power, something that can and should be very well used by the US player.  Against a fast AC, the goal is to prevent it from driving you off the map, and instead use delaying tactics until a hard counter is available.  Or just plant a mine in the right place and the AC will hit it before engaging you even once ;)"
CompanyOfHeroes,378l16,CreepyOctopus,2,Wed May 27 20:49:36 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. The PE AC is very lightly armored such that even infantry small arms (like rifles/BAR) can do some damage to it.   If your only options are T1/T2 (riflemen/support weapons), an obvious counter to the armored car would be the riflemen with sticky grenades. Another alternative would be the HMG (it already does some solid damage vs. the AC, but with armor penetrating rounds ability it will absolutely shred it)."
CompanyOfHeroes,378l16,trineroks,2,Mon May 25 19:56:23 2015 UTC,you really shoulden't tech to stick bombs to counter the AC. any decent player wil micro the AC and kite your rifle's to death. better spend the munitions on mines and the fuel for an M8 or Bar's

CompanyOfHeroes,378l16,redditors_r_manginas,1 point,Wed May 27 20:31:58 2015 UTC,"Good suggestions here already, but don't forget about mines and tank traps. US engineers do extra damage vs panzer grenadiers already, so grabbing an extra squad is a good idea. If you lay a few mines where you anticipate his AC will hang out/pass through, you can seriously mitigate it's field presence for 100-200 munitions.   Use tank traps to force it over your mines. You don't even have to finish building them if you don't want to; they will still block the vehicle's pathing, they'll just be easily destructible by small arms fire."
CompanyOfHeroes,378l16,MyCaG,1 point,Tue May 26 00:45:45 2015 UTC,"All you need on Semois against ACs is the center of the map for its green cover or the houses on the side. Just keep your riflemen in green cover and they will handily beat an armored car. Positioning here is extremely important, so try never to get caught in the open.  Depending on what strategy you're going for you can also ambush your opponent with stickies or mines."
CompanyOfHeroes,3770g8,F1SH_T4C0,3,Mon May 25 11:54:09 2015 UTC,"Well, blobbing as Ostheer only really happens on the lower skill-levels. It simply isn't viable and it isn't manpower efficient enough to survive higher up.  Giving up what little map control you have to achieve dominance over a small area simply does not work, and it certainly doesn't work as well as an MG-supported, smaller force, especially since the last patch (although I personally think they should have kept the damage the same and simply increased the suppressing power, but that is complaining on a high level, as the MG42 currently is a good MG)."

Allies can usually start strong, but by  late game its ALWAYS about German armor. You just can't stop it if they coordinate together, there isn't that much firepower in the game other than the P47s. If they roll with a couple Tigers and a few Mk4's you have to drop everything and focus on that or they will roll to your base and wreck everything in seconds. This forces you to usually abandon the flags and you give up a ton of the map, even if you manage to hold them off.

I play mostly as Ostheer, and if I can't manage to hold back the American horde or the wave of Shocktroops/Guards in the first ten minutes, I won't be able to field enough firepower to contain my manpower bleed that is bound to follow once the Americans get their first Sherman.   A single US grenade in the first ten minutes can decide a game, because the best grenade in the game combined with the smallest frontline infantry squads can easily wipe if you're not careful for a second.

CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,gentleman_caller,-1,Thu May 28 08:44:32 2015 UTC,They had units in the top right corner for COHO. I guess they could implement that into COH1 if they wanted without much of a stretch. But nooo.
CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,trineroks,5,Sun May 24 17:11:14 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's still there on vCoH; just the units are by default collapsed under a single shield icon (as well as unit group shield icons).

CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,halcyon950,3,Mon May 25 16:54:02 2015 UTC,So I just reinstalled vCoH to see how they handled it.  Somehow I was under the impression that you could permanently uncollapse the unit shields by clicking on the single shield icon itself. So yeah I was incorrect in my second reply. My apologies.
CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,nichts_neues,2,Wed May 27 00:41:18 2015 UTC,True sight brings new levels of strategy to the game. I remember hiding a Panther behind the north east house on City 17 one time and flanking and Enemy ISU while it was trying to pull out. So glorious. Also can you even imagine trying to use units like sturmpios without true sight?
CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,Cuddles1612,9,Sun May 24 23:31:50 2015 UTC,"At this point you're comparing two different games. There are some things COH1 definitely did better (tech, universal upgrades, strat points, balanced commander system, RNG is more reasonable) and some things COH2 does better (all factions viable, true sight, vaulting, minimap/tacmap improvements, prioritize vehicle, reverse button, sniper play, etc). They're really different games at this point.  I think, today, because of the shrinking player base of COH1, COH2 almost definitely has a better multiplayer experience"

CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,7,Mon May 25 10:22:44 2015 UTC,"True sight and vaulting are the biggest advantages CoH2 has.  Personally, I find the emphasis on LMGs and super high long range DPS make it a drastically inferior game, but I'll cop to that possibly being personal preference. If you're a long time CoH player, you'll struggle with the lightning fast kill time in CoH2. I understand some people prefer it, but I cannot stand it.  If they patched true sight and vaulting into vCoH and allowed strictly Wehr/US matches, it wouldn't be close.  Edit: some more thoughts about factions. All four factions are better designed than PE/Brits, but none of the four are even close to as well designed as vCoH US/Wehr. I miss the effect unique veterancy had on 1v1s, as well. Despite being broken as all hell in 3v3 and 4v4, the ""accrued vs. purchased"" design of vCoH meant that each faction had fundamentally different incentives. Wehr could be more aggressive in hunting squad wipes, while Americans lived and died by their preservation of their first four Riflemen (in most conventional strats). In CoH2, everyone has accrued veterancy, so retention is critical across the board."
CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,SrpskaZemlja,2,Mon May 25 00:10:27 2015 UTC,"This post confirms some of my impressions.   super high long range DPS   One of the most unfun aspects of COH1 is snipers.   lightning fast kill time   Likewise PE, while not overpowered, is trite because of the instagib units they have like P4Inf Tank, Sector arty and the like. Instakill effects remove the focus on tactics and good micro, to supplant them onto luck. Rifles vs. Volks + MG is vastly more interesting than Rifle and Engineer blob vs. PG blob, or lethal ACs that remain just out of Rifleman range early game."
CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,Bromao,4,Mon May 25 07:18:30 2015 UTC,"Snipers are actually less of an issue than LMGs in CoH2. LMGs do insanely high DPS and some can even fire on the move, which is stupid. It's pure suicide to charge an LMG-wielding squad in CoH2 instead of just a mildly bad idea. And they're much more common, too.  And yeah, it has a PE feel to it, for sure."
CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,velmarg,4,Mon May 25 17:56:31 2015 UTC,"Its still there, trust me. The last patch definitely balanced the game out. I'm still thoroughly enjoying the game and with the new British faction coming out CoH2 is very much alive."

CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,Mandarion,2,Mon May 25 11:12:08 2015 UTC,I find the CoH1 interface clunky by today's standards.  Organizing anything was a pain.
CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,Account_Eliminator,2,Mon May 25 06:46:29 2015 UTC,"The problem is, Nihilus33, Your asking the CoH reddit in it's current state this question. Anyone really left here to answer you is obviously going to be very into CoH 2.  Company of Heroes 1 and Company of Heroes Online meant a lot to me. I still hang around here. I watch CoH 2 games from time to time to check in with how it's going. For me, CoH 2 still doesn't beat CoH 1. But CoH 2 is newer and offers a lot of new things so in that sense it is more interesting.  When it comes to battles though, the fire fights don't last long enough and there is more emphasis on what units beat what other units than positioning and cover. Players don't get much opportunity to respond to changes on the battlefield and there is a greater value in vehicles in contrast to CoH 1."
CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,Inukii,9,Sun May 24 15:30:44 2015 UTC,and there is more emphasis on what units beat what other units than positioning and cover   This just isn't true. Cover is incredibly important if you want to win firefights.
CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,Account_Eliminator,-2,Sun May 24 17:43:36 2015 UTC,"No, there is more emphasis on what the units are than positioning and cover.   Cover still helps. But compared to CoH 1 Cover is far less important.   In CoH 2 you get things that charge over negative cover armed with close range weapons and will kill the things in heavy cover. In CoH 1, with the exception of knights cross holders, units traversing over open ground against a unit in heavy cover tend to take a lot of damage.  IE - More emphasis on unit type and not cover."
CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,ryanman,6,Sun May 24 17:51:17 2015 UTC,"In CoH 2 you get things that charge over negative cover armed with close range weapons and will kill the things in heavy cover.   I mean... that's a bit too generic. Yes, this might happen, for example, if you have shock troops charging volks - but again, volks are one of the worst infantry squads in the game out of the gate and one of the cheapest, whereas shock troops come out at 2cps, cost 400something manpower, and are a dedicated anti infantry unit with no av capabilities.  But try rushing a riflemen squad with sturmpios or pgrens like that and then tell me what happened."

CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,Inukii,1 point,Sun May 24 23:26:48 2015 UTC,"there is more emphasis on what units beat what other units than positioning and cover   That's not true, there's no target tables now, so in fact it's the exact opposite of what you just stated.  Also as far as this subreddit goes it's ten times as active as it was in 2011. So comparisons can't be made. To an extent that is greater than CoH1.  I agree with other points you make, especially about infantry not being as important as vehicles late game."
CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,Sondrx,0,Sun May 24 17:52:45 2015 UTC,"Whats a target table? I'm only using observable data since.  I'll have to take a look at some games then to see if this is true. Last time I checked. Still seeing blind charges and blobbing win over positioning.  I didn't say that the activity was lower. But it would probably be unreasonable to suggest that only people who dislike the games stick around in the reddit. If I were to hop on to the League of Legends reddit for example and say ""Is this game good?"", I'd probably get a similar response asking the same question in any other games reddit.  So I think it'll be kinda difficult to answer Nihilus's question honestly."
CompanyOfHeroes,373fpc,TrollMcTrollerton,2,Sun May 24 17:59:31 2015 UTC,"Target tables were the sliding statistics used for CoH1 that meant each unit was balanced against other units individually, for example US engies did extra damage against PE but not Wehr, therefore CoH1 was more about this unit beats that unit than CoH2. Also I think cover actually matters at least the same amount if not more in CoH2's latest patches. In fact yes, cover since October 2014 cover now matters a lot more in CoH2 than it ever did in CoH1, they made it so units actually stay behind cover in neat lines, and it makes cover exponentially more important.  It took them two years but CoH2 has now improved on CoH1 in nearly every way."

CompanyOfHeroes,37396e,CreepyOctopus,3,Sun May 24 13:39:11 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Yes for the linear build system, no for commanders that give mid-game infantry (obersoldaten, paratroopers, AT rifle, etc.). OKW units sometimes bank on a mid-game infantry ""blob"" to bridge to heavy tanks. Small arms are fine. Flanking pays off huge and is a major requirement. Grenades, weapon additions/upgrades, panzerschreks, etc. add a lot of flavor to flanking and general infantry movement. COH2 has more of a base income to MP income. It is munitions and fuel that is a little more critical, but comebacks definitely happen (within reason).  Commanders are still a touchy subject. Some love them, some hate them. The more ""linear"" commanders are sadly considered the ""best"". So, the commanders that offer more variance are generally lacking, or locked behind a minor paywall or a very rare endgame war spoils drop.   I say pickup COH2 and play. They are Alpha testing some new things that I feel will add a lot to the game when it is released. Now is a good time to get into it, especially with COH1 players dying off."

With fuel & muni coming from all points, is it viable to get a big advantage by being able to cut off a crucial strat point for a few minutes, like on the classic CoH tourney maps?"
CompanyOfHeroes,37396e,Bromao,2,Sun May 24 16:10:14 2015 UTC,"It's no mystery that they're working on the UK faction, so that obviously means a new expansion sometime in the future.

With fuel & muni coming from all points, is it viable to get a big advantage by being able to cut off a crucial strat point for a few minutes   Definitely, while every non-victory point gives you munitions and fuel, they only give a small amount of those so cutting off fuel/munition points is crucial"

I also played the beta and it came VERY close to me not even getting the game. Slow paced inf combat and heavier vehicle emphasis were a major part, and the mortar changes were brutal.  I think you'll find infantry combat to be even faster paced than coh1. This is a double edged sword as it can occasionally mean that a squad you've been babying all game gets wiped with a great flank but it also means the vet 3/vet 5 units in mid late game aren't invulnerable."
CompanyOfHeroes,37396e,ryanman,1 point,Sun May 24 20:35:08 2015 UTC,"Of course the slower-paced nature of CoH1 infantry combat was great. It generally allowed to place a greater emphasis on correct positioning and timing of the engagement, and not twitchy reactions to retreat in time."
CompanyOfHeroes,37396e,Deftonez,1 point,Sun May 24 20:50:03 2015 UTC,"If you stay at long range in heavy cover, that's ok. The trick is now you have to watch your units. There's more lethality at close range, and nades are easily dodgeable but can easily become a wipe if you aren't correctly moving within cover.

CompanyOfHeroes,37396e,TychoCelchuuu,3,Sun May 24 17:23:12 2015 UTC,"So with the encouragement of some here, I got the base package, and played a few matches.  I was immediately amazed to see, for the first time, cover working properly, as in my units actually staying there. That is great, as is true sight. Every unit I've had a chance to use so far felt much better than in the beta, which is not a surprise.  On the downside, it initially seems like the criticism of the tech trees is warranted. As Soviets, there are only 2 global fuel upgrades (and 1 non-fuel), all in the HQ building, and that seems to be it. Commanders, while boringly linear, seem to play a larger role because they offer access to several important units not otherwise available."
CompanyOfHeroes,37396e,TychoCelchuuu,4,Mon May 25 12:57:41 2015 UTC,Yep. That got changed. Are you sure? CoH income was more tied to territory than in CoH 2. Yeah this still sucks.

Generally, Pathfinders should be used in a support role and never as front-line infantry as they have fairly low DPS due to the squad consisting of only 4 men, two of which are equipped with mid-range carbines. What makes the squad unique are the two Scoped Garand equipped ""snipers"" Which have the ability to kill infantry models below 40% HP if hit.   The BAR benefits from their range and accuracy veterancy bonuses, and allows the squad snipers more opportunities to utilize their sniper critical. What you are noticing is a fairly powerful ""synergy"" between a high DPS weapon like the BAR and the killing power of the scoped garand. Here is an example video using the mg34 (pre-patch)."

CompanyOfHeroes,36xbtb,HauntedGrass,16,Fri May 22 22:03:32 2015 UTC,They are T-26s. They were outdated when the war began and many were destroyed in the beginning months of Operation Barbarossa.
CompanyOfHeroes,36xbtb,SD0S,2,Fri May 22 22:39:45 2015 UTC,I think I read somewhere that it was actually a beneficial thing that they were such terrible tanks because it forced the Russians to design a tank that wasn't hopelessly outclassed.
CompanyOfHeroes,36xbtb,warbastard,7,Sat May 23 05:09:44 2015 UTC,"It's actually the reverse, or at least it goes both ways.  When the germans attacked they were entirely surprised by the T34 and KV1 tanks (in service late-1940 and 1939 respectively). Their AT weaponry was ineffective. This led directly to a few things. For starters the P3 and P4 switch roles. The P3 was intended to be the main line german tank and the P4 mounted a low velocity gun, but had a larger turret ring. The P4 was upgunned because it had the larger ring. I think P3 production switched to mostly StuG3's. The tiger, panther, and ferdinand were all developed as answers to soviet armor. IIRC there was an order directly from hitler that started 'the development of a tank that could mount an 88mm gun.' The 88 was pressed into an anti tank role because of the ineffective anti-tank weapons the germans had at the start of the invasion, 37mm paks or so IIRC.  It's worth double checking what I said here. I think it's all more or less correct. I did manage to dig up a story about those 37mm AT guns.   A combat account from Operation Barbarossa highlights the problem with the T-34/76’s fire control systems and also why its overall combat power is so overrated. “Remarkably enough, one determined 37mm gun crew reported firing 23 times against a single T-34 tank, only managing to jam the tank’s turret ring”.(11) In this engagement T-34 proponents will highlight the impunity of the T-34 to the 37mm Pak 36 AT gun. However this is hardly surprising against a gun that can only penetrate 29mm of 30 degree sloped armour at 500metres with ordinary AP ammunition. What is really important in this story is that the AT gun managed to get 23 shots off, and it turns out that the T-34 in this report didn’t even manage to hit the AT gun. Once better AT guns appeared, which they rapidly did, T-34s would be lucky to survive 2-3 rounds.   Source  That site seems to have a lot of good information."

CompanyOfHeroes,36ybq4,Jarnis,1 point,Thu May 28 00:16:46 2015 UTC,"While I agree that the amount of paid DLC is kinda annoying, I certainly wouldn't call it a pay-to-win model; many of the best commanders are default ones. Also you get commanders from drops too, so it's not like you have to pay for them."
CompanyOfHeroes,36ybq4,Ivanthehorrendous,13,Sat May 23 23:34:50 2015 UTC,"This same argument is almost always applied in most free to play games, which is a little sad when you are talking about a full priced game. Since the drop system is rubbish you can't reasonably get a commander that you want in any decent time frame. The fact that even most free to play games have better systems for this is frankly pathetic for a full priced release."
CompanyOfHeroes,36ybq4,pojoman007,2,Sun May 24 04:20:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I love the game, but since the drop system is so bad, commanders are essentially locked behind a pay wall. Commanders make a big difference in the game and it just stinks that you basically just have to buy them if you want a specific one. It's too bad, because even if they decide to change the system eventually, we've already been dealing with this system for so long now, it won't feel like much of a consolation."

But I was mainly responding to OP calling it a pay-to-win model. It's not. I win the majority of my games and I haven't spent a dime on anything but Western Front.

CompanyOfHeroes,36ybq4,Handy_Banana,-2,Mon May 25 14:04:37 2015 UTC,You should boycott it if the game grinds your gears so much and don't come back.  Tell me more about how you got a better deal on an older game that was easier to make in a different market than what CoH2 is competing in.  I got Tie Fighter for $5 back in the mid 90s so I now expect all games to deliver as many hours as missions as that game and only expect $5.
CompanyOfHeroes,36ybq4,anon4773,0,Mon May 25 14:37:53 2015 UTC,"While I agree that it is questionable to have so much dlc for a full priced game, most of the dlc commanders are not viable at higher ranks.  Specifically for soviets the meta commanders are guard motor and shock motor.  For us airborne is the best of all and infantry is not bad.  For okw all the base ones are probably better then dlc ones, maybe with the exception of fortification who has stationary pak.  I think only for osteer the meta commanders are dlc such as elite troops mechanized and close air support. But the base ones are decent too.  So you don't need dlc but they do charge a lot and I agree with someone here who made a suggestion to sell a pack that would give all commanders present and future for 10-15 bucks."

CompanyOfHeroes,36vrwc,USSZim,7,Fri May 22 16:19:51 2015 UTC,I've tried to explain why its OP but people refuse to believe it.
CompanyOfHeroes,36vrwc,daspoulos,2,Fri May 22 18:35:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't understand why people defend it. I always see people make the argument that ""well there's nothing else useful in the commander, therefore it's perfectly ok!""  I'm not saying its impossible to defeat, it's not and there are counters, the problem is the counters are expensive, locked in commanders, or come out too late to adequately counter the ability meaning by the time they come out, they have placed the HQ on your cutoff, denied half the map from your team, and have gained a considerable amount of resources.   For example, by the time a walking stuka comes out (~8-10min), the game is likely already over, and it has a 2 minute recharge, along with the fact that some buildings take 2+ rocket hits to kill.   MHT is locked behind a commander, if you do not have it in your loadout that is just not going to happen. Its flame barrage ability (the counter) is expensive and inaccurate, and takes 2+ direct hits minimum to set fire to weak buildings, more on the stronger concrete ones. I have had some success using assault grenades from assault grens, granted you have all 5 men alive, some buildings go down in 2-3 grenade barrages, but it is inconsistent. If they build it in a strong building though it will have little to no effect.   Other potential counters do not work well (pioneers w/ flamethrowers & flame halftrack) as the halftrack is extremely expensive and comes out too late (T3), while pioneers will simply get focused fired before they can even fire off a single flame attack on the building (which takes 30+ seconds of continuous fire to set alight).   I'll admit, it's a high risk / high reward strategy to use it. If you are facing a competent team and your team doesn't know how to utilize the FHQ, it can be defeated.  The problem is, some maps are extremely beneficial to the FHQ, such as Lienne Forest, La Gleize, Angermunde (get it up on the right building near ammo and it's as good as ""gg""), and of course, the worst of the offenders, Ettlebruck Station. Other maps this is bad on arew City-17, Sittard (even though I do not play this map ever because of the bridges), and Moscow Outskirts.   I've suggested before that a good change to make this more ""balanced"" would be to only allow it to be set up in allied-controlled / connected territory, or give it a set up time during which the squad setting it up inside is vulnerable. Maybe even making the building itself vulnerable to AT gun fire would work. Another change would be to maybe increase the re-enforce time somehow with this building, so that conscripts cannot instantly re-enforce to full strength. An increase in re-enforce time would allow you to counter it ability with mortars, mgs, etc.   Again, I do not understand why people defend this broken ability, unless they themselves continue to abuse it."
CompanyOfHeroes,36vrwc,FlyingSMonster,2,Fri May 22 20:42:43 2015 UTC,"They need to bring the flame track back to tier 2 without the tier 3 upgrade requirement for the flamers.  Like so many other things, the reason it was nerfed was fixed and it was never reverted."
CompanyOfHeroes,36vrwc,internet-arbiter,0,Fri May 22 22:22:43 2015 UTC,Something to consider is that the SOV player that uses it spends 60 fuel to put down the HQ which significantly delays tech. Indirect fire units such as OST Mortars and OKW Infantry Guns can counter it. Is it powerful? Yes. Is it OP in light of some of the OST and OKW commander abilities? I don't think so.
CompanyOfHeroes,36vrwc,PenitentAnomaly,1 point,Sat May 23 03:28:17 2015 UTC,The whole point of FHQ is to surround it with atleast 3 mortars. This counters all mgs and enemy mortars.
CompanyOfHeroes,36vrwc,daspoulos,-1,Sat May 23 06:46:35 2015 UTC,"Well, a mortar ht can rain down the incendiary.  If you don't waste too many resources on taking it out, or delay the game long enough, a CAS player (or any with stuka strikes) will destroy them.  A rushed Stuka zu Fuß will counter all of it.  It can be a killer but if you play smart about it won't be gg.  Long games will relegate the player to fighting with doctrinal units. Its only saving late game grace could be its arty or booby traps.  Most of the non WFA maps have only wooden structures which are very weak."
CompanyOfHeroes,36vrwc,Tomakaze,0,Sun May 24 00:52:59 2015 UTC,"Does the FHQ cost any popcap? If not, give it one; if so, make it higher. If they made the FHQ have a high enough popcap, and thus also reduce manpower income in the same way as other units, it would be easier to balance its strength. I like your suggestion about increasing the reinforce time. I think those two changes together would help keep it from being overly OP while still being fun to use.  It would also be fun if its buffs decreased and its reinforce time increased as the building took more damage. That way, you could make progress by just injuring the building, even if you aren't able to fully take it down."

CompanyOfHeroes,36vrwc,DasArsenal,1 point,Sat May 23 02:11:09 2015 UTC,It gives infantry bonuses. You build one with three conscript squad spamming reinforce and sandbags its brutal.

CompanyOfHeroes,36vrwc,DasArsenal,-4,Sat May 23 02:07:42 2015 UTC,"Costs sixty fuel which means it precludes teching a building as Soviet and has well known, minimal effort methods of being destroyed.

CompanyOfHeroes,36vrwc,DasArsenal,2,Fri May 22 17:53:20 2015 UTC,"What are the minimal effort methods of destroying it? I shot at one with AT guns and it took forever. If he backs it up with a mortar and an AT there is very little you can do. Late game tanks can kill it, but that's a long time to cede a fuel point."
CompanyOfHeroes,36vrwc,lkysam,3,Sat May 23 01:21:30 2015 UTC,"German mortar outranges Soviet mortar - bleed manpower or knock down the HQ  German mortar halftrack - incendiary barrage, gg HQ  Stuka - one volleys most HQs, two volleys the rest.  Attack Ground/Move - Pak (slow) or flame pios (you have to push them back slighty)  Field Gun - bleeds manpower or knocks down building, your call  Or, you know, go around it - 60 fuel sunk into an immobile structure that locks him into conscripts means the rest of the map should be relatively light.  2x regular points > 1 fuel point  You're right though - if you insist on butting your head straight into it and assaulting it without support weapons, 1v1, you'll lose more men than he does.  Life's hard."
CompanyOfHeroes,36vrwc,DasArsenal,4,Sat May 23 02:06:53 2015 UTC,"While the circumstances of the building placement can make the hq a contingent advantage, your response is even more circumstantial, it precludes that the hq isn't right where you yourself need to be the most"
CompanyOfHeroes,36vrwc,bmwatson132,-1,Fri May 22 21:02:47 2015 UTC,I urge you to name me a map where a single HQ has penned you and your allies into your base.  The closest you'll come is Semoiskiy Summer.  I urge you or anyone else to address the advantage you gain from an early game 60 fuel deficit that the HQ costs  and write it off as inconsequential.
CompanyOfHeroes,36vrwc,DasArsenal,1 point,Fri May 22 22:15:12 2015 UTC,Ettelbruck Station and Trois Point if you spawn north. Train station or the stone church. Both needs 2 full Stuka Barrages to get destroy. You proceed into a quick T3 to punish the Stuka and finish the game by the pressure you got early on.
CompanyOfHeroes,36vrwc,Chukonoku,0,Sat May 23 15:59:58 2015 UTC,"On Ettel it doesnt lock anyone into their base or lock out a fuel point - and it only really pressures the muni point, that isnt locked out either.  Trois Point locks two river crossings but - again - doesnt lock out a fuel or munis and the entire other half of the map is unaffected.  I'm not saying it's worthless but it's really just a situational inconvenience, sort of the like the non-doctrinal heal, reinforce, and suppression platforms that every wehr player can build."

CompanyOfHeroes,36w0pk,devils_brigade,5,Fri May 22 16:18:02 2015 UTC,Going for a T70 + a T34/76 is a waste of resources.  The better strategy is to stick to infantry + Zis + anti-tank grenades + guard rifle infantry and save all your fuel for the t34-85 call in after hitting 10 CPs.
CompanyOfHeroes,36w0pk,mscomies,5,Fri May 22 19:08:59 2015 UTC,"Not particularly true. While stalling for call-ins is the ""safer"" choice most of the time, in the case you managed to get a big lead in the early game against your opponent, calling a T-70 will let you capitalize on it, especially if you have good micro. It lets you dictate the flow of the game and you'll be applying more pressure with your T-34/85s.  Stalling for call-ins defers the initiative to your opponent in the mid-game, as you will be the one on the defensive and you'll have to make something happen with your T-34/85s.  Having said that, in most cases you are better off stalling for call ins as it's pretty hard to get a definite lead in the early game against certain commanders like CAS. I'll still advocate going for tier 3 if you have a superior field presence, it's better to keep pressuring the advantage."

CompanyOfHeroes,36ueu2,HuIkSMASH,6,Fri May 22 13:07:57 2015 UTC,"Only a sniper properly counters another sniper, I find, and so the whole battle becomes about them rather than about flanks and the like.   Wintroopers!  Though really, snipers are technically not difficult to deal with.  They are significant units in battles but killing them off does not need to be the #1 objective in planning out battles and win conditions.  The advantage from routing your opponent's army with flanks, for example, is almost comparable to killing off the sniper.  The ensuing map control allows you to place deeper land mines (which can also kill off snipers), wire off cover, and of course provide a resource advantage that could lead to a tech advantage that snipers have no power over.   why are snipers so annoying?   It's unfortunately a game mechanic that's supposedly balanced out by a high manpower cost.  Their role is to counter support weapons, but their rate of fire is fast enough to deal with infantry while kiting."
CompanyOfHeroes,36ueu2,Account_Eliminator,6,Fri May 22 08:45:37 2015 UTC,"Remember that ridiculously comprehensive 2v2 guide for US you wrote, you should link that every time you comment anywhere I feel :P"
CompanyOfHeroes,36ueu2,troglodyte,3,Fri May 22 09:30:48 2015 UTC,"Snipers have been an integral part of the vCoH metagame for as long as I can remember, as they force counterplay and most importantly inflict massive net manpower damage if they're microed correctly.  There are more counters than that, though. Jeeps and Bikes can make your opponent's sniper micro hell, and they cost a lot less than the sniper. Countersniping is pretty easy, too. And if I'm against a good sniper player, I'll shift my strategy. Instead of rushing BARs, maybe I'll Greyhound rush. Instead of T4, maybe I'll go T2.  Aside from that, I don't think I agree that it isn't about flanks at all. Wehr-vs-Americans in CoH1 is still the most dynamic matchup in the series and my favorite in RTS games. As an American, if a Wehr player goes sniper before Volks-Volks-MG, I salivate.  Snipers are a powerful role player, but don't be afraid of them-- know their weaknesses and play around them. Remember, snipers are expensive and can quickly be turned into a liability."
CompanyOfHeroes,36ueu2,marinadeee,3,Fri May 22 14:58:41 2015 UTC,"Bikes are decent in terms of cost and DPS. Jeeps are utter suck and naturally countered by Panzerfaust. Also Bike/Jeep are mostly viable early game; by midgame, another Sniper is better.  Snipers really took off after the patch where Relic fixed a movement bug they had where they threw themselves on the ground. That meant that snipers committed a bit more to battles they were actually in, as opposed to now where a single sniper can kite 2 vanilla rifles by himself on maps like Sturz.  All of this said, I think you give good advice here. BUT the pro tourneys speak their clear language: Snipers are extremely versatile and dominate many/most matchups. If that's how it is with the pros, nothing we say is going to change that."

CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,christobevii3,1 point,Fri May 22 14:34:37 2015 UTC,I would agree. I would rather them be an infantry counter than have the capability to be a walking AT platform.
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,relkin43,3,Fri May 22 17:31:45 2015 UTC,O__o idk man we need that AT because P4's and stugs are made out of glass and do poop dmg.  P4 Shrek dmg with a stug or p4 at their back is mandatory for dealing with russian steel legions midgame.    EDIT: Also micro your grens well and upgrade them with MG's and they do really decent dmg against infantry esp if you kite.  Once they hit Vet 2 they become slaughter machines.

For example:   What makes you think Wehr has a problem in early game? What kind of problem? How does buffing the Panzergrenadiers specifically address that problem? Is there any alternative solutions?"
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,ryanman,3,Fri May 22 05:52:33 2015 UTC,I'm just screwing around. I certainly think they need a buff but the 5 point plan was just supposed to be a joke since almost anyone who plays as the Wehrmacht has been complaining about this for a while.
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,Mandarion,3,Fri May 22 06:28:32 2015 UTC,Or lower the initial and reinforcement cost.  Right now it is silly how bad they are for their cost.
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,Mandarion,2,Sat May 23 04:16:48 2015 UTC,"Armor buff would be great, honestly. The pgren issues are twofold - first their at upgrade shreds their anti inf capability (reasonable) but they still lose multiple models per Sherman/t34 shot. Then they get run over by tanks as well!   The shreks are, as a result, only good vs tank destroyers. They need slightly more resiliency in general by in particular I want them to be a threat to tanks after you cripple them, not just Shrek pinatas"
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,relkin43,1 point,Fri May 22 02:40:36 2015 UTC,I think maybe if you get the schrek upgrade that it should come with like shock troop armor. That way they don't die as fast and they are something to fear a bit when you're tank runs into them. That way they arent too OP when they don't have schreks but neither are they when they do.
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,relkin43,0,Sun May 24 20:46:47 2015 UTC,"I would rather see them getting a fifth model, allowing them to survive a single HE shot from a Sherman. As it stands now, the units they are supposed to counter once they get their upgrade are able to one-shot them regularly and easily."
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,relkin43,0,Mon May 25 15:07:56 2015 UTC,No because then their dps would go up with 3 mp44s and 2 schreks. Everybody would make them because they'd be like volks except even deadlier and would defeat the purpose of debating getting schreks or not. 4 pgrens are something to fear up close. 2 with schreks are not. Give them better armor so they can live longer so then you cant just mindlessly charge a unit up and kill them and that they can at least fend for themselves.
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,relkin43,0,Tue May 26 12:00:52 2015 UTC,"Giving them armour wouldn't change the problem that they can't face the unit they are supposed to face once you upgrade them. Give that fifth model a K98 for all I care (or an MP40, the worst weapon in the game)."
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,SurSpence,0,Tue May 26 15:11:11 2015 UTC,"I'm relatively conservative with them, I just think it's a little silly they are outclassed by BAR toting Riflemen. And honestly, like you said, it is more of a durability thing for me."
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,relkin43,1 point,Tue May 26 15:16:45 2015 UTC,"Bars are fully automatic rifles. Think of an m1 garand that shoots fully auto. I'm pretty sure that's gonna pierce through armor no problem.   Also pgrens are a close range unit so if you are charging them straight into a rifleman with a bar you deserve to lose them. Unless you have them in a halftrack or something there is no reason you should be charging them up to them.  Think of them as sturmpios. They are not call-ins and should not be used recklessly. It is not silly because 1. That BAR cost 125 mp and like 15 fuel and i think 50 muni. Thats pretty expensive for an upgrade! You're pgrens do not cost 405mp+50muni+15fuel (that is the price to get 1 bar and 1 rifleman).   Pgrens cost 360mp and are specifically designed for close range and anti tank combat, not run and gun tactics. That is your fallschrimjager (only when coming out of a neutral building), Obersoldaten, Shock troops."
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,Orestes910,2,Sat May 23 18:35:34 2015 UTC,By that logic a single Panzergrenadier squad costs 660 manpower and 60 fuel with the tech upgrade and the building. If you take away the tech costs for both then you get 360 manpower versus 280 manpower and 60 munitions. My point is that they are outclassed as hell for such similar prices and that there is a clear advantage for the riflemen.
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,Orestes910,2,Mon May 25 15:18:01 2015 UTC,"Yes it is. Both are tech upgrades that are one time fees and the difference is the Panzergrenadiers cost significantly more to get and it really isn't that much.  Scout Cars are also useless against the USF because all of their light vehicles can kill it  And you said yourself you need a halftrack to use them which is a bit ridiculous.  Also, let's keep this about the game. You have never seen me play, I have never seen you play."
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,troglodyte,2,Tue May 26 14:44:47 2015 UTC,lol scout cars; If you lose BARs to scout cars you are doing everything wrong.

CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,troglodyte,2,Tue May 26 15:52:19 2015 UTC,Well I've got some more bad news for you; wehrmacht is getting a hard nerf with the next patch if the last alpha patch is anything to go by.  Stug price is going up and their T2 and T3 building prices are going up by at least 50%.
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,PipeGameLethal,1 point,Wed May 27 15:32:45 2015 UTC,That can't be correct... The Stug is already insignificant in general and teching is their biggest issue.

CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,horribleone,4,Wed May 27 15:16:27 2015 UTC,Are they supposed to be elite infantry though? I don't think they are.
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,Natedoges,5,Fri May 29 01:52:42 2015 UTC,They cost almost as much as Shock Troops and are equipped with an advanced rifle and SS dot camouflage so I would certainly say so.
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,horribleone,6,Fri May 29 04:09:43 2015 UTC,I could only see it if their shrecks were taken away. Having them be on par with elites and allowing them to get the best infantry AT in the game would be silly.
CompanyOfHeroes,36t97v,Mandarion,13,Thu May 21 23:12:10 2015 UTC,"Depends on the changes. It's a lot more complicated than the first pass would have us believe.  Assuming identical weapon entities, the ideal hand-held AT unit cares about five things over all else (in no particular order):   Model toughness (from received accuracy, armor, HP, etc) Model count Accuracy modifier Reload time modifiers Unit price   In the case of P-Grens, you're paying a manpower premium for their StG-44 rifles. Buying 'schrecks makes them fairly catastrophic at anti-personnel work, which is what you're paying a premium for. On top of that high cost, giving them two 'schrecks means that 50% of their models are carrying droppable weapons. That's not ideal for an AT squad-- obviously 5 models to share 2 AT weapons around in is better than 4, since it decreases the chance of losing your investment.  So then the question becomes: what would you change? Buffing the MP44s directly would be ideal: it improves their anti-personnel performance, and actually makes the 'schreck upgrade worse, since the opportunity cost is munitions plus losing your MP44s. Other than that, some toughness upgrades would not go amiss-- it would make them an all-around more useful unit, and I personally think it would not be overpowered. It would also be worth looking at cost if they're not getting buffed-- if they're going to get trounced by every other assault troop in the game, they should be cheaper. It's entirely feasible to buff the unit and also increase the price, which could help them be meaningful instead of a wasted slot, even if it ends up being a zero-sum change on paper.  It's not a matter of elite versus non-elite, to me. It's a matter of having a role. Volksgrenadiers with MP40s were emphatically not elite troops, but they were more serviceable as assault troops than CoH2 Panzergrenadiers are right now. That's largely due to the differing metagames-- CoH2 has insanely high long-range DPS that's marginalized all but elite, specialized assault troops-- but also a function of the wonky balance on the unit."

PGrens are fine the issue is manpower costs for USF and wehr are stupid. USF spends 440MP to tech (Lt/Cpt +Major) and gets free and really good combat units. WM pays 760 manpower to tech to tanks and receives absolutely nothing

Yet the failure of say-on-pay suggests that shareholders and boards genuinely believe that outsized C.E.O. remuneration holds the key to corporate success.

Anyways, I somehow feel the system gets treated a bit unfairly, I know it gets a lot of flak because of the heavy amount of duplicates and how hard is to get something you want but before WFA you couldn't get any of the ""Premium"" commanders without paying. I mean, sure, it's hard to get commanders, in my case I've gotten ""only"" 5 premium commanders: Spearhead, Lightning War, Luftwaffe Supply, Rifle Company, Elite Armoured but before that the only way I could have gotten those would have been by shelling out dosh."

CompanyOfHeroes,36n5nm,PipeGameLethal,8,Wed May 20 18:13:40 2015 UTC,Ost gets upgrades from BPs so it must pay for tech double. OKW needs tier building for granates. USF gets free weapon sqaud from tech. Pretty fair trade.
CompanyOfHeroes,36n5nm,KrulAsfalt,1 point,Wed May 20 17:34:40 2015 UTC,Not to mention that the Ostheer has to build a building to get access to their basic infantry...

CompanyOfHeroes,36n5nm,Mandarion,3,Sat May 23 00:37:30 2015 UTC,Probably a grandfathering thing from COH1 to add faction diversity. Honestly I hate it because it forces me to give up ground just to upgun my squads and slows down my entire tech tree for little gain some times. That is mostly cause I get the tech but never get the weapons due to muni shortages or just for the fact I keep forgetting to pick up the weapons.  The grenades is practically the only weapon upgrade I get every game because it works and feels good when upgraded. you unlock it and everyone gets it no matter what so everyone becomes more effective instantly. Really needs to go back to their roots and once a weapon is unlocked you get 1 of them per squad or something.
CompanyOfHeroes,36n5nm,tipsy3000,2,Wed May 20 17:37:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the travel time in late-game seems like an oversight. I'd wager that there were two different people who designed the major/ambulance mechanic and the weapon unlock mechanic. It doesn't ""break"" the faction but it does feel unintentional and sloppy.  Another poor design issue is the fact that the racks look nearly identical. If I have to waste time hovering over them to see what they are, that's a design flaw, plain and simple.  Overall, I like the faction design and think they mostly made great choices—these are nitpicks. I still think the balance needs adjusting, but more along the lines of nerfing the other factions, I think we're in a good spot for USF (maybe bazookas could get a buff)."

CompanyOfHeroes,36n5nm,MolotovFromHell,1 point,Fri May 22 08:30:23 2015 UTC,The price is in the tech for both Germans they need to tech to get those.  Plus Americans get a squad when they tech unlike any other faction so I think they added the price on each upgrade in an attempt to balance it and make it unique as well.
CompanyOfHeroes,36n5nm,MyCaG,1 point,Fri May 22 15:05:45 2015 UTC,"You can also give these upgrades to any inf unit you build which is why they need to be unlocked separately as opposed to indigenous to riflemen. One argument might be to unlock the BAR with the Lieutenant and the bazooka with the Captain, but you'd probably need to up the cost of these tech tiers to justify that.  The travel time isn't that big of a deal. Chances are every squad you make will be retreated multiple times in a game so just grab an upgrade while you're reinforcing."
CompanyOfHeroes,36n5nm,Katter,1 point,Wed May 20 17:44:30 2015 UTC,"I have to agree that paying to unlock the weapon, then paying to equip it, and having to go back to base is the most annoying thing about USF, even slightly more annoying than their paper-thin tanks IMO. Theoretically it is cool that you have a choice of what you upgrade to, but since Bazookas aren't good anyways, it ends up being more annoying than interesting."

CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,Waylander0719,2,Fri May 22 14:25:14 2015 UTC,"Well in that case we should question Relic's NDA-policy, instead of questioning OP for not knowing about something he is not allowed to know anything about.  Seriously, the entire game would be so much better if Relic would just get off their arses and started talking to us. I know that community work is a demanding job, press-releases have to be carefully worded, statements to the community looked at ten times before they go out. But Relic simply vanishes into nothing after releasing a patch, waits for one to two months to say anything at all (even acknowledgements that a perceived problem is known or has been added to their list, and thus make the talking go away).   Sometimes the whole situation reminds me of a guy holed up in a tower, with a mass of people surrounding the tower, calling at him because he knows something the people would like to know. Yet that guy has barricaded all windows and doors, doesn't look out of the windows and only sometimes gives signals with smoke out of his furnace, which then has to be interpreted by the people around his tower (which obviously leads to misunderstandings, frustration and useless discussions and fights). And whenever Relic asks what we think about the game, I can only say ""Game? I don't want to talk about your game, I want to talk about your information policy!""."
CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,Mandarion,1 point,Fri May 22 14:48:19 2015 UTC,"Actually, I wish that 2v2 was more balanced than an allied win rate of 70%. Look at just soviets vs ost. Soviet mortars are more accurate, more health, more damage, more range. The ost mortars have higher fire of fire and faster vet. I actually just tested this, did 10 1v1 with only a morart from each side. German mortar lost every single time."
CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,Masterfuzzfuzz,5,Thu May 28 01:18:57 2015 UTC,"I would argue that the lack of an HMG is replaced by the two most effective anti-infantry light vehicles in the entire game: Luchs and Flak half track.  I agree that the Kubel isn't nearly as valuable as an HMG squad and feels useless later on. I don't play Axis so I can't really say, but from my experience most OKW players will have either a flak or a Luchs before I'm even ready to deal with light armor."

CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,ryanman,2,Fri May 22 17:29:05 2015 UTC,OKW's lack of a non-doctrinal HMG.   Kubalwagons? They are basically a HMG but better in some ways.   OKW's lack of a non-doctrinal vehicle snare   Mines? Also this is to balance the fact that they have the best armor.
CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,Waylander0719,-1,Fri May 22 14:30:26 2015 UTC,"they have the best armor.   Definitely arguable, especially considering that the King Tiger now has the same armour as an IS-2, has lower DPS than an IS-2 (hello long reload time, too little damage output compared to the IS-2), and in general is a slowly moving hulk of metal that barely does anything.  The Panther is en-par with the Jackson in terms of AT, perhaps a little bit better, but then again it does cost more and in general fielding two Jackson is easier than fielding two Panthers (meaning you should have superiority in numbers). In terms of anti-infantry, no tank beats the Sherman with HE - the Sturmpanzer IV comes close, but the reload time makes it worse, as does the bigger squad size of Allied units.  Given that the Soviets and USF have vehicle snares to punish overextending tanks, the OKW armour doesn't look all that good anymore, all of sudden. That doesn't mean it's bad - the Panther is still among the top-tanks of the game, at higher vet it is the best tank IMO - but simply saying that OKW armour is better isn't exactly true."
CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,Mandarion,1 point,Fri May 22 14:56:56 2015 UTC,"The King Tiger is better than the IS-2.  I understand the point you are trying to make, but it is as if you didn't even bother to look up its stats and make an anecdotal and emotional reaction that is NOT based in fact.  The KT does 240 damage compared to the IS-2's 160.  Combined with the accuracy, the scatter, and AOE the KT is much better in every category except for top speed as you mention but that in no way means it ""barely does anything.""  Their armor is the same now, yes, but Allied AT apart from the Jackson has generally lower penetration values across the board which makes the KT's armor better in many more matchups than its Allied counterparts.  Plus the KT has 240 more health.  Did I forget to mention that the IS-2 is doctrinal and the KT is not, but you knew that.  http://www.coh2-stats.com/ballistic_weapons/is2_d25t_122mm_mp  http://www.coh2-stats.com/ballistic_weapons/tiger_kwk43_88mm_mp  Now the Jackson is a great TD if not the best once it hits vet 1.  I guess there is the jagdtiger but it is doctrinal and way more situational.  One thing is true about both of them.  Without the he shells on the JT, both are useless against infantry, which are the bread and butter of the OKW army.  If the OKW isn't fielding armor, the Jackson is absolutely useless.  A panther at least has a pintle mg and coax gun than gives it a mediocre ability against infantry.  Plus it has the speed, health, and armor to run them over, something that is very difficult and risky for a Jackson.  Both allied AT snares have 100 pen = 27% KT, 31% Panther, 28% Panther Vet 2 chance to penetrate and damage the engine. As much as allied players have the ability to ""punish overextending tanks"", OKW tanks have the armor to be much more forgiving when overextending.    Based on the Panther and KT, saying that OKW armor is better IS true.  There is just less of it which is where the Allies regain parity, and we are back to balance."

MG34 is shitty compared to 42 but at least functions just barely, and the strafe/paradrop is great. Compare that with a 6man volks squad and a 270 fuel fixed turret tank or basically ""an ostwind!"" and it's no contest.  The other commanders were nerfed past usefulness so playing OKW can be rewarding, but in 1v1s or 2v2s it so much more high stakes than other factions."

OKW has problems because Soviets can hard counter them in a few ways:   Flame car wrecks OKW with no answer early game. OKW is very vulnerable to mine spam since fielding two sturmpioneer squads with minesweepers is expensive. Guards do great against most OKW vehicles and now PTRSs are just OP in general. Heavy mortar punishes ambitious truck placement.

If you see them go T1 get a quick rakattenwerfer and laugh as it gets one shotted.    OKW is very vulnerable to mine spam since fielding two sturmpioneer squads with minesweepers is expensive.    Just make one then and use it well, 2 squads with sweepers is expensive for everyone, and only OKW has a starting squad that kicks ass in combat AND can put away their mine sweeper to not be permanently nerfed on combat power.    Guards do great against most OKW vehicles and now PTRSs are just OP in general.    PTRS aren't that bad even on guards, the RNG is kinda annoying. The only time they are a problem is when they are spammed on conscripts    Heavy mortar punishes ambitious truck placement.    Ambitious truck placement is supposed to be a risky gamble, if they spot it and build a counter to it why shouldn't that counter punish it?"
CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,Waylander0719,0,Fri May 22 14:29:19 2015 UTC,"Getting an early Raketen means one less infantry squad at the crucial early game.  Also the flame car has wiped a squad by the time you see it and build the raketen.  No, it is not even close to being as expensive for everyone else.  Two squads of Soviet combat engies is 340, Sturmpios it is 660.  two engies is 10 pop, two sturms 18.  That is a large drain on manpower income.    Also to minesweep effectively you have to have the sturmpios out in front where they eat rifle bullets all day which is a very cost ineffective way to use a close range squad that requires careful micro to get in close and be effective.  So your way the OKW inf capping the other side of the map just has to eat the minespam, oh joy.  Not to mention Relic made the OKW mineweeper not have the range of other minesweepers.  For their cost Sturmpioneers blow.  They do not kick ass in combat.  I would much rather have two squads of soviet combat engies and a conscript squad than two sturmpios which is still under the cost of two sturmpio squads!      The PTRS should not break machine guns or snipe infantry like it does now.    It shouldn't completely shut it down and against a faction that relies on sitting behind sandbags to give their rifles a chance the heavy mortar is mindlessly easy to use.  Also the precision strike is a guaranteed squad wipe.  There is no skilled counter play.  The ISG doesn't even come close to countering it."
CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,anon4773,1 point,Fri May 22 17:30:21 2015 UTC,"You can check the fog of war anytime during the game.  Look at their base and you will see the outlines of their buildings.  This will give the early heads up of a scout car.  At that point, either build a raketenwerfer, or let go of an early schreck and place an early mine right where the scout car is most likely to go.  Lure it over it and it will be 30 munitions well spent and the need for the early schreck will not be needed nor will the raketenwerfer.  240+240+170=650  320+320=640  Your math is a bit off BUT the reinforce costs make the double Sturmpio much more expensive so you are still right."
CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,Tomakaze,1 point,Sun May 24 19:51:30 2015 UTC,"Math annoys me but he insisted on going there.    So if they just get snipers or penals you got a raketen for nothing and you have 270 manpower on the field doing nothing.  Also if they start a building, cancel it so it blows, and start another building you can't tell what they are building.    Your only counter to an early game strategy shouldn't be just one mine.  There is no way that is a fair game where map control rests on the placement of one mine.  Allies are supposed to have an advantage in the early game but not that big of an advantage where a squad wipe is inevitable.    It is not like I'm the only one saying this either.  I don't get how this point about flame cars being too effective against OKW is so unpopular.  If you go against it yourself you will see how bullshit it is.  Or doing it to someone else.  It is the easiest build to pull off in this game and it is too effective against OKW.  At least Ostheer has fausts.    Why would you build anything else against OKW?  The scout car hard counters the kubel and hunts it down easily.  Shit, the only downside is if they completely read it and build a raketen which is such a massive risk that no OKW player will do it."
CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,anon4773,2,Mon May 25 03:12:52 2015 UTC,"You are right, the scout car is a total pain in the ass and I hate it.  I played a game against a top USF player (Looney) and I was Ost. I tried out a sniper start and it was going ok.  I knew that eventually he would bring out the infamous M20 and hunt down that sniper.  I laid a teller mine right where I thought the two would meet.  It wasn't exact but I used the sniper to lure the M20 on the mine and destroyed it.  It's not a similar matchup but it illustrates the point I am trying to make  I know it isn't a great or reliable strategy but you can make it work after all, the scout car wants to destroy your kubel, use it as bait.    Ultimately, it does feel too effective.  I am just offering some alternate strats that could prove viable if unorthodox.  Finally, remember scout cars cant run over reinforced wire.

CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,anon4773,-1,Thu May 21 16:24:31 2015 UTC,"In response to your conclusion: OKW gets better units at the cost of more manpower. A soviet player with 5 con squads will need much more micro than an OKW player with 2-3 Obers. Then there's their ridiculous vet system, vet 5 units are practically unkillable. OKW doesnt have a non doctrinal HMG, but they dont really need one to be honest. They have other things that the other factions dont have to make up for it. I play mainly allies, but anytime I switch to OKW I find it so unbelievably easy to win games, I'll find myself floating 1000 manpower because I simply dont need to use it."
CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,M4ve12ick0,2,Thu May 21 00:08:34 2015 UTC,You might not compare conscripts with Obersoldaten. Obersoldaten are elite infantry and conscripts are peasants from the field - literally.  If you want to compare them compare guards with obersoldaten. In such a 1v1 matchup guards win 10/10 times when the obers are not upgraded with LMG34. When Obers are upgraded they still lose 7/10 times to guards despite the fact they reeinforce at horrendous 50MP/Model and costs 400MP. Vet5 Units are still as vulnerable to indirect fire as vet 0 units. As a matter of fact Volksgrenadiers Vet5 have higher received accuracy as vet 3 conscripts. Every other unit such as Obersoldaten is easily killabe by indirect and tank fire since received accuracy does not prevent near misses to do damage. Obersoldaten and Jäger and Fallschirmjäger are the only units getting a rather big amount of received accuracy bonus. They are 4 man squads though - coincidence? I let you decide.  Out of your observation about the floating MP you draw the wrong conclusions I am afraid. Vehicles and caches are the biggest MP sinks in the later stages of the game. OKW is not able to invest its Manpower to fuel and furthermore is not able to invest manpower into for example general purpose medium tanks like a panzer IV.
CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,DivineBigbird,2,Thu May 21 07:42:02 2015 UTC,upgraded obers mess up my guards most of the time. it also really depends on the equipment of the guards.
CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,Mandarion,2,Thu May 21 11:49:21 2015 UTC,"Of course they do, but if you upgrade your guards the playing field is pretty much even, if not slightly in favour of your guards."
CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,M4ve12ick0,-2,Fri May 22 14:59:53 2015 UTC,"Buddy I have no idea how you're playing but your obers should not be losing against any soviet infantry. The only infantry that can hold its ground against LMG obers, are paratroopers, or shock troops if they somehow manage to get close enough to you, in which case you've made a mistake. You're probably not picking your engagements wisely if your infantry is losing to the soviet."
CompanyOfHeroes,36lgpu,Katter,-2,Thu May 21 15:29:26 2015 UTC,"While I understand your points, I think what you have said boils down to ""OKW is different and it forces them to build certain units."" But it is interesting that OKW lacks infantry and vehicles snares (suppression and engine crits). But, it seems to me that they make up for it by having some of the best potential anti-infantry and anti-tank DPS, like Obers, Falls, Flak HT, etc. They can't rely on snaring their enemies, but they're pretty good at bullying them off the field.   If the things I've heard are true, some future changes might mix this up, potentially fixing some of these issues (or making them worse) ;)"
CompanyOfHeroes,36iw9x,USSZim,7,Tue May 19 18:45:27 2015 UTC,"This usually covers anti-infantry, and bazookas and grenades take priority over BARs.   It's your playstyle. You've got plenty of AI so BARs are extra resources you don't need to spend. BARs have a mobility advantage (they fire on the move) compared to 1919s or flamers (which don't), but I wager you are more static since you like the AAHT. That is to say... you prefer a standing fight to a mobile fight, I think.  I am very mobile with my rifles so I love BARs. Try a build that's focused on mobility. If you like the LT, try an M20. It's naturally a more mobile choice than the AAHT. Slip it in after rifle 2-3.  Or try a straight sherman rush. I like 4x rifles + nades and single BAR into captain -> Major -> Sherman (Jackson sometimes as needed). This is a very mobile build that favors BARs over 1919s/flamers because they don't work on the move. Probably plop down a mun cache because you are gonna want lots of smoke. I love to push forward with my rifles. If I hit an MG/kubel/flakHT/etc I prefer to use the lead squad to smoke the suppression threat while the others keep moving (with flak HT, tends to insta pin - use another squad). I hit anything I can close with and toss grenades through the smoke. As I keep pressing another squad will drop more smoke as the first wears off or the suppression threat re-positions."
CompanyOfHeroes,36iw9x,thefonztm,3,Tue May 19 18:58:58 2015 UTC,"Great advice.  Also, remember M1's are more powerful than Kar98's on mid/short distances. Kars win in long distances. Staying mobile Is thus crucial to win an small arms firefight. A BAR will be more useful than a 1919 in such an engagement."
CompanyOfHeroes,36iw9x,fyreNL,3,Tue May 19 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"I personally only go bar when I want to go for an early territorial victory with mass infantry instead of relying on support weapons more or less vs wehr since they dont get serious vehicles till mid game. Usually ill pick up grenades first primarily for smokes to help battle any MG's then go bar when I am floating enough munitions to spend on a bar or two then soup up my infantry squads. I actually tend to go LT for the extra bar and pick up the M20 ASAP to compensate for the lack of AT since it gives a vehicle crew with a bazooka + the M20 also doubles up as a good AI and chase down vehicle so its a win win. Once the enemy is pretty much denied fuel or denied long enough to the point where I can get some serious armor with little armor opposition I swap over to the heavy duty stuff to clean up loose vehicles and squads to assert map dominance and to end his HQ.  Otherwise like you said, I tend to go bazookas simply because its a much safer bet in the long term and there is many other alternative AI weapons."

CompanyOfHeroes,36kton,Penang_lang,6,Wed May 20 03:01:59 2015 UTC,"Glad to have you join us!  1) Someone can answer this better than me, but I'll do my best. At it's core, it is still CoH. If you are familiar with CoH1 then this shouldn't be too much different. Some changes include: all units are more fragile (realistically so); each faction has multiple commanders, but can only bring 3 into a battle (and can only choose one to use); infantry can vault over cover (increases flanking capabilities); and sight is now determined based on the actual line of sight from each squad member.   A note about that last point, True-sight: in CoH1, each squad had a radial view that could bypass objects. Now, you can hide units behind cover such as fences or buildings. This changes a lot about deception and your ability to ambush.  2) War spoils was brought in last year. Basically, you can change your commanders, faceplate (cosmetic profile thing), vehicle skins, bulletins (minor passive buffs), victory strike (cosmetic), and decal (cosmetic, only one exists). The only things that really matter are commanders and bulletins. Any of these items drop randomly based on total playtime. Think drops like in TF2 or CS:GO.   The system is unpopular because some commanders are inherently better than others and you are given the option of playing until you unlock them or buying them. Keep in mind this is a full-priced retail game.  3) In CoH1, each faction has 3 doctrines/companies/commanders. Now, there are a multitude for each faction. For example, the USF starts with Infantry, Airborne, and Armor. You can unlock, or buy, the Mechanized, Recon, and Rifle commanders. Soviets and Wehrmacht have many, many more. Like CoH1, you will only actually have 3 to choose from when in game, and you may only use 1 throughout the game.  There is a big change I forgot to mention: commander unlocks are now linear. This means they got rid of the command point tree that was in CoH1. Instead of spending your command points, the game automatically unlocks the next item on your list, with a total of 5 unlocks per commander.  4)    There is a big update coming soon, which will introduce [something we can't mention (NDA)] and change some things about the existing factions.  Soviets and Ostheer (or Wehrmacht) are generally the strongest factions. I personally prefer USF, but it comes down to your choice. Soviets and USF come with their best commanders, while Ostheer needs to unlock Mechanized Assault (which has the Tiger and very powerful early infantry) or Close Air Support (which is generally seen as OP) to be its most powerful. That being said, commanders are not entirely necessary, as their impact has been lessened from CoH1. Lastly: unfortunately the in-game community can be pretty hit-or-miss. More often than not people either don't talk at all or are utter jerks. Every now and then I meet a friendly player, but most of the time people will be very rude. That's the biggest downside to  me."
CompanyOfHeroes,36kton,USSZim,1 point,Wed May 20 03:52:10 2015 UTC,"1: Ostheer plays incredibly familiar to how the Wehrmacht did in CoH1. Back when CoH2 was released i did ridiculously well with the faction, simply due to its many resemblances. USF also feels a bit like the Americans from CoH1. Soviets and OKW are completely different.  Get to know true sight as well. It can be really useful for you, as well as your opponent.  I apologize, but it's going to be a long piece of text until i've explained all the differences between CoH1 and CoH2.  2: Not a big fan of those. Bulletins give you a bit of diversity, and there are many to choose from, but since you get them from war spoil drops (and that's the only way to get them) at random, you're probably wishing for one you don't already have.   3: The amount of commanders add diversity, but their impact isn't as big as a doctrine did in CoH1. In a way, this system in the game, is a steep nose-dive imo in comparison to CoH1.   4: I'd rather have the CoH1 community. Not saying i didn't meet dickheads or completely silent people there, but it seems the CoH2 community is a little less fun to play with. Not saying everyone's like that, though.   Also, on a side note, winter maps with blizzards suck. You'll probably dislike them due to the fact it bogs down the game a lot."
CompanyOfHeroes,36kton,fyreNL,1 point,Wed May 20 05:58:32 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, thanks for bringing up the environment conditions, I forgot about that. On winter maps, there are things like ice, which can break and drown your troops, and blizzards, which freeze troops and shorten sight-lines. Luckily, winter maps don't come up as often. There are other environment conditions like mud on the map ""General Mud"", which slows troop movement down."
CompanyOfHeroes,36kton,USSZim,3,Wed May 20 06:07:46 2015 UTC,"Everything you know from COH1 is an lie. COH2 is a completely different experience and plays much, much faster than COH1.

I made the switch after about 150 hours of gameplay and it was a pain for me to make the mental switch and not use the old key assignments.    However, I definitely can feel that I'm a better player with the grid key system.  Every control is within reach with the best improvement probably being using ""r"" for reverse rather than ""u"".  Tanks and vehicles represent huge investments in the game and there is nothing worse than not being able to reverse out of a bad situation because you can't find/reach the damn ""u"" key.

Also points that produce both Munitions and Fuel, and pop cap that is not tied to map control.   You guys are right, its a totally different ballgame.   I played a few games with Ostheer - these guys really play like the  Wehr from CoH1, so I adapted quickly to them.  The OKW on the other hand, feels a bit like the British + some elements of PE.

He'd build so many overlapping MGs, AT guns and artillery emplacements that no conventional force could hope to get within sight range. We'd spend an hour or so getting to this point, with me sending troops and the occasional vehicle to test out his defenses. He'd get dug in so deep, he wouldn't have enough population left to field more than a squad or two of Engineers to keep everything topped up.  Of course, I'm just building dozens of my little rolling minions in between probing forces. I keep them around corners, just out of sight.  I wish our computers were in the same room, so that I could see his face as my Goliaths come trundling out of the treeline. I wish I could see the incredulous gasping I hear over our voice chat, while he watches them slide in between the cracks of his defenses. I always save just a handful to send directly into his MGs' fields of fire, to herald the beginning of the end and to give him some hope that he might stop them before they reach the bulk of his defenses.  He can't. There is no stopping them.  Fire and death and salty, bitter tears ensue.  Only two words can describe the feeling:  Worth It."

CompanyOfHeroes,36fb8z,ProfessorPith,8,Mon May 18 23:18:37 2015 UTC,I hated these so much because they would throw bridge maps even further into Germany's favor. Germans would detonate bridges early on and keep one next to the destroyed bridges so that they would instantly blow them up again if you repaired them
CompanyOfHeroes,36fb8z,USSZim,5,Tue May 19 04:11:32 2015 UTC,That's less of a problem with Goiaths and more of a problem with destroyable bridges.
CompanyOfHeroes,36fb8z,LordStrabo,2,Tue May 19 11:43:16 2015 UTC,"The problem was that the germans had multiple ways to destroy bridges immediately, both doctrinal and not.  And the Americans had one way to do it reliably, which required engineers to spend time to set charges manually on the bridge.  If they couldn't, they needed to use expensive doctrinal artillery barrages to take it down, and it always required multiple shots.  Terror strikes, Stukas, goliaths, and 280 barrages could all one-shot the bridges."
CompanyOfHeroes,36fb8z,macrovore,1 point,Tue May 19 16:27:40 2015 UTC,"I would park mine at a bridge, camouflage it and wait for troops to cross.. Or I'd use it to cover a retreat and blow up a counter attack that would pass too deep into my territory...I will admit it was a little OP but it wasn't necessarily cheap."
CompanyOfHeroes,36fb8z,Meyerd,1 point,Tue May 19 19:25:57 2015 UTC,"Destroyable bridges are great, it changes up the map, it presents a unique challenge and set of skills needed to tackle the situation and the battle situation can change so quickly, sectors can be cut off, surprise flanking attacks can be made, it adds a layer of complexity to maps. It means the ability to manipulate bridges like rapidly repairing, destroying and blocking is essential to the game.  It would be cool to see commanders really focused (IMO commanders should be highly specialised) on combat engineerig, they should have 2 doctrinal units (super engineers and an engineering vehicle) and abilities that enable them to interact build unique structures (such as aid stations, repair stations) and more and better field fortifications, trenches, fox holes (more useful for all round defence), roadbloacks (like cutting down trees to block roads). The combat engineering vehicle could clear obsticles and pre-build bridges to be layed rapidly.  My favourite maps have always been the ones with the most bridges."
CompanyOfHeroes,36fb8z,Todda468,12,Thu May 21 05:33:19 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting if they were deployed from pioneer squads rather than bunkers, keeping the pios vulnerable and immobile while they ""operated"" the goliath (with a fixed range, perhaps dependent on line of sight from the pioneers).

CompanyOfHeroes,36fb8z,Rarharg,4,Tue May 19 08:52:37 2015 UTC,"that is actually a brilliant idea. what about adding these factors too:   remote control radio signal has a limited range (so they can't be deployed from the saftey of your base) killing the pios makes the goliath 'abandoned', and basically a sitting demotrap that can't be recovered by any party but can be salvaged"

CompanyOfHeroes,369mar,Chukonoku,5,Sun May 17 15:02:08 2015 UTC,"My opinion on the subject, from the PoV of a top30  First of all: Skill >= Meta > Map > Balance.    Skill n Meta   Basically, you can't complain of losing if your opponent is better than you or he is playing meta and you don't. If you want to win on unorthodox ways, you better outplay your opponent.   Map   People don't complain about it as much as perceived faction imbalance. Overall you have enough vetos as both factions to ban unfavourable maps. The only problem should be that you are forced to play META on some cases. There are some really popular (or frequently played cause other maps are vetoed all the time) that get's imba on one side (Ex: Moscow) or others which favour a certain faction (Rails and Metal or Rhzev Winter).   Balance   Soviets will remain the generalist strongest combination IMO if playing good ol Meta commanders. I'll say is the least punishable faction.  OH needs to be played solidly early on (split push and spreading is bad) and basically counterplaying whatever the other faction is doing. Most people fail on this, trying to do their ""own"", without checking enemy commander or tech choice (You check SU base at 1, 3, 8-12 mins).  USF is meant to be played agressively. The moment you give a break to Axis, you might regret it later on, specially on the lategame if you don't have the micro/multitasking.   OKW: babycare your vehicles and gain veterancy with your infantry. Thats the whole point of the faction. You are fine as long as you overcome this stages without wipes: Light vehicle (M3, M20/AAHT) and early tank phase (T70/Sherman). With vet your units get utterly broken.     Problems with each faction:  SU: non meta sucks  OH: housecard like early game. Problems with teching cost  USF: micro/multitasking late game.  Some specifics problems regarding AT dispostition or performance.   OKW: faction as a whole :P Either you like it or you hate."
CompanyOfHeroes,369mar,Mandarion,3,Sun May 17 15:52:23 2015 UTC,"If you want to win on unorthodox ways, you better outplay your opponent.   Exactly. We can see this with RedxWings quite often, as he tries to play out of the box - sadly this doesn't always work, because some people will be able to just run you over in such a situation.   OH: housecard like early game. Problems with teching cost   Not just the cost, but also the time. Researching and building takes longer than teching up for any other faction. Rushing for something is pretty much impossible for the Ostheer, especially considering your already low field presence due to the small squads and not being able to set up a forward retreat point..."

Tales of Valour was a dissapointment as well, and don't even get me started on Dawn of War 2. It was ridiculous. They eventually managed to un-do their fuckup after releasing Retribution though.

CompanyOfHeroes,36b8ep,TheLivinDead,2,Mon May 18 01:39:16 2015 UTC,Ya I've been shitting all over USF players as Ost in 1v1 lately.  Once you get the Tiger out you just play conservatively with it and take safe shots at their infantry trying to cap.  Once the Tiger vets and the USF player has no manpower and loses a few vet squads you tighten the noose and then that is game.  You can do the same with the Stug E and it is such a manpower drain on USF that their options start to get limited quickly.    Although I know how annoying it is surviving against USF rifles in the early game as long as I hold my fuel and 1 star I win.  I just wish the USF vs Ost matchup wasn't two extremes.  It feels like a gimmicky matchup.
CompanyOfHeroes,36b8ep,Ragman676,1 point,Mon May 18 03:12:53 2015 UTC,"As an all USF player, I can't tell you how frustrating that tactic is, and how GOOD it is. Tigers are such a pain in the ass its insane. Microing them works so well. The shell is painful enough to wreck blob tactics, Zooks are seriously damn near useless even on rear armor. You need like over a dozen hits on the rear and usually you can run pretty effectively and repair. Getting that many squads with zukes is also painfully expensive and reduces their infantry effectiveness. The AT gun is way weaker than the soviet version, again pretty useless unless flanking. The only saving grace is Jacksons, which have to be Vetted to use the AP shot. They go down in 2 tank shots, or are disabled to the point that a 3rd shot is guaranteed so you have to Micro them like crazy. Moving them into flanking shots is very hard because a couple panzershrecks will fuck it up as well. USF has really nothing to counter conservative Tiger tactics, other than playing as Airborne and getting the P47's, but even then that's a lvl 12 ability and the games don't always last that long."
CompanyOfHeroes,368qbh,ggthemachine,5,Sun May 17 06:48:32 2015 UTC,I wonder how that game would've worked out if the factions had been in reverse. There's a reason why Allies are top-pick in tournaments.
CompanyOfHeroes,368qbh,Fimconte,4,Sun May 17 10:02:09 2015 UTC,Yeah you can't get a better matchup than playing SU against OKW. The Isg can't keep pace with an 120mm. Puma's and jagpanzers' are no match for t34/85s with Mark target.  OKW is pretty mundane in 1v1.

The comparatively little recognition my maps has garnered shows that these types of maps are for a fairly niche type of players (or probably I'm just not very good at mapmaking). Added onto the fact it takes a long time to make, I can now understand why people refuse to make co-op maps.  Still... all things considered I am fairly happy to make these maps.

I tell it to attack right next to the tank and immediately cancel the attack and tell it to move towards the tank. I continue to do this swapping back and forth to assure the tanks barrel is facing the direction that I want the entire time. Its ghetto and requires you to be watching the tnank the whole time but in those tense moments it really comes in handy.

CompanyOfHeroes,364ou6,nicksam112,11,Sat May 16 02:49:25 2015 UTC,"The Praying Mantis was an attempt to produce a low-silhouette vehicle that could still fire over obstacles. A one-man design based on Carden Loyd suspension was not adopted, but the inventor was encouraged to design a two-man version. This version appeared in 1943 and was based upon the Universal Carrier. The hull was replaced with an enclosed metal-box structure with enough room for a driver and a gunner lying prone. This box, pivoting from the rear, could be elevated. At the top end was a machine-gun turret with two 0.303"" Bren guns. The intention was to drive the Mantis up to a wall or hedgerow, elevate the gun, and fire over the obstacle from a position of safety. It was rejected after trials in 1944. The illustrated Mantis survives in the Bovington Tank Museum.   From here: http://www.reddit.com/r/TankPorn/comments/2mjzv8/the_praying_mantis_prototype_universal_carrier/"

CompanyOfHeroes,361cmb,USSZim,7,Fri May 15 07:14:05 2015 UTC,"It does fill a weird role, and I imagine most of the time it is better going for something else. Which is too bad, because I actually think that they're quite fun to use, but they're just a little too vulnerable to bring out late in the game.   Their activated ability (the stun) seems to be their real selling point. You can lock down even much bigger tanks so that your AT guns or tank destroyers can get some shots off. It doesn't last too long, but it is reliable, so as long as you have good micro, it can be pretty effective. It is true that it doesn't have quite the anti infantry power as the halftrack, but it is close if you get close so that all of its guns are firing.   I think I might consider getting the Stuart when facing infantry heavy opponents who seem to be holding out for an expensive tank like a King Tiger. If you know your opponent's tanks will be delayed, then you really need some strong anti infantry, and a Sherman won't help much once that big tank comes out anyway, so the Stuart can have at least a few minutes of being pretty good, as long as you keep it away from AT. It should almost always have an escort, so that if it does encounter AT, it can stun while your other units take out the threat. I have seen some players go heavy on Pumas (using call-ins), and I think you could use the Stuart to surprise the Puma and stun it, while your Captain comes in for bazooka hits."

CompanyOfHeroes,361cmb,Solliid,2,Fri May 15 14:32:57 2015 UTC,"The Stuart with Cpt tech has one single job early on, counter mech play by OKW while you mantain map control early on with your Rifles.  A Puma is a defensive play and a Flak HT is OKW power peak to regain control during the midgame. Works on 2v2 and up, so you shut down OKW while keeping your edge.  By no other mean, the unit is useful at all."

I find once T3 happens the Stuart's survival abilities and usefulness drops pretty quick.  I think it's more of something to try and stall Axis early to midgame advancement more than make any major changes like some vehicles can. You wont get the anti infantry power/squad wipes like a Greyhound does (or used to at least) but you'll have enough to pepper them and slow/stop an advance or at least make 'em buy a few models back, and you got enough AT to deal with light vehicles or disable a medium tank. It's in a weird place because it's designed for a very weird role that no other unit really fills."
CompanyOfHeroes,361cmb,daspoulos,1 point,Fri May 15 08:33:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's most useful for disabling enemy tanks so you can blunt an attack or ensure a kill. If you can get a stun chain or engine crit on an enemy vehicle within range of your AT gun or Jackson, it can turn the tide of an engagement. I think the best thing is to keep it behind the front lines until you see an opportunity, then use it's speed and small target size to rush in, crit, and GTFO. It's not particularly pricy at 240/70 so it's ok to trade it for a more expensive enemy unit."

CompanyOfHeroes,3604ha,twiklo,11,Thu May 14 23:38:17 2015 UTC,"Some of this is plagiarized from a previous comment of mine and it's a bit lengthy (sorry), but I hope it helps:  Even hard counters in this game can be defeated by super efficient micromanagement. If you tell your tank destroyer or AT gun to attack a tank with a single click and leave it at that you will sometimes/often lose the engagement or fail to kill the enemy unit. If you tell your machine gun to attack an advancing infantry squad but don't reposition it once your enemy knows where it is set up, it will probably die in the next 30 seconds to 1 minute from a flank, sniper, indirect fire, etc.  Always think about what weapons your squad has, what weapons the enemy squad has, and each squad's relative toughness (number of models)x(1/received accuracy modifier)x(armor). Each weapon type is most effective within a narrow range. In descending order from max range to close range: bolt-action rifles, light machine guns, semiautomatic rifles/carbines, assault rifles, sub-machine guns, [pistols].   Always think about what range you want to fight at to maximize your weapons' effectiveness and minimize those of your enemy. As an obvious example, shock troops (6 models, 1.5 armor) vs grenadiers (4 models, 0 armor): grens will want to stay at max range to avoid the shocks' SMGs while picking off models as the shocks close in. Conversely, the shocks will want to move in close under cover or concealment and start blasting away at point blank range.  Next think about cover. There's a good tip on the loading screen about it - what you see is what you get. A stone wall is better than a wood fence or cart. A church is more durable and useful than a small shack, and will allow your units to see farther. Cover only protects you if it is between you and your enemy. Be aware of the enemy flanking to attack from an unprotected direction, and use this tactic yourself whenever possible. When defending, it is generally advantageous to let your enemy approach you over a space with little cover while your units engage from cover, but keep in mind what weapons are in play. If you have only short/midrange units, it may be best to draw your enemy into close quarters where there are lots of sight blockers, then ambush him.  Grenades are a huge part of infantry play because they can instantly turn an engagement around. Grenades kill or damage multiple models within their blast radius, and can even wipe squads instantly. Whenever your squads are targeted with grenades, they will call out ""grenade!"" or something similar. Look for one of the enemy soldiers putting his gun away or crouching - he will send a small smoking projectile at your men. If you can predict where he will throw it, move away from the target spot instantly. If you think you're about to take it in the face, retreat: it's almost always better than losing a squad. Note that the numbers appearing above grenades once they land are NOT 1/10ths of a second. They are 1/10ths of the grenade's fuse time, which may be below 1 second. The 5 second timer on satchels/airborne demos is an exception. Use grenades when you see an opportunity of tightly grouped units or to force your enemy out of cover. Try to predict if/when/where your enemy will move to avoid you, and toss it there. And don't run on to your own grenades!  There is so much more depth to infantry combat than that, but hopefully these basics help you a bit. Just keep playing and watch replays to see what you could have done differently. Use the tactical map (num pad 0) to keep track of large numbers of units that are far apart.  Also note that for every game type and every faction in automatch your first 10 games are randomly skill matched as the ranking system tries to place you so you're probably getting hit by people much better than you. Good luck!"
CompanyOfHeroes,3604ha,MyCaG,7,Fri May 15 06:29:47 2015 UTC,"It's tough man, I'm used to getting my shit pushed in. You just have to roll with it.  One thing I learned is how important it is just to have bodies on the field. Thank god for shitty ostruppen. Just having number in the beginning is important, from what I've learned. Then as you progress you can replace those shittier units with better ones.  Try to get some kind of half-track or something that you can upgrade the gun with for rapid movement, effective anti-infantry. That way you can move around the map quickly. You can also use them for temporary green cover, al though I'd avoid using them as your primary cover.. but it's helpful for covering infantry caught out in the open or during a push.  You also have to micromanage battles a lot, even tank vs. tank, flanking, breaking up your infantry blobs and moving them to individual cover or leap frogging them forward.  Also grenades and rifle grenades are your friend. (If you can spare the munitions, don't screw yourself over by using too many munitions on grenades)  But take everything I say with a grain of salt because I still get my cornhole plugged every match, but these strategies I've learned have helped me stay in the fight A LOT longer.. Almost won a match yesterday. lol  Everyone had their own strategy, you have to develope one you can work with."
CompanyOfHeroes,3604ha,Meyerd,3,Fri May 15 03:16:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely start by playing against bots. If you play 2v2s or 3v3s with bots, it can relieve some of the tension of being responsible for everything, and give you a chance to use your units as best as you're able.   Part of the difference between COH and something like Starcraft is that things like facing and cover matter a lot! I would encourage you to not focus as much on countering your opponent, and instead focus on having a balanced and useful army composition. Choosing direct counters is important, but only when you already have a good army comp.   For example, if your opponent is building tanks, it makes sense to build AT guns. But if you only build AT guns, the tanks can flank you, and you have no safety against infantry. So, when you're thinking of countering your opponent, think more about the way you use your units, not just which units.   Another important aspect is holding territory. Even if you're destroying your enemy, if you don't take territory, your enemy will be gaining an advantage, and by the midgame, you won't stand a chance. If you can win a battle, make sure you capitalize on it by taking territory, Fuel for teching up, and Munitions for upgrading units and for things like grenades and artillery strikes.   As others have said, you have to get through like 10 games to have matchmaking work. Also, people who are active in matchmaking have probably been around for a while. Maybe it would help to set goals for yourself other than winning, like reduce your enemy to 350 victory points, or survive until you get a tank on the field, something like that."

As for matchmaking your first 10 matches with each faction are random so you could face rank 15 or rank 15,000. After that you should get matches closer to your skill level."

When and when not to fight with infantry was the first big breakthrough. If you don't know when you're outmatched because you don't know what infantry is stronger than another at all of the different engagement ranges and different available cover, you can end up bleeding a lot of manpower early on with reinforcements without noticing. And then once that happens your economy balance and unit composition gets thrown out of whack and the game becomes unsalvageable."
CompanyOfHeroes,3604ha,kioni,1 point,Fri May 15 10:54:50 2015 UTC,"Keep playing and playing. Keep trying new things as well. The game mechanics are rather different from any other game I know and you simply need a lot of experience to be able to tell what units are good in what situations and what engagements can when and how be won or when do you have to retreat. For example some infantry units are better at certain ranges than others; this is something you have to learn, and the unit descriptions in the game can be sometimes misleading or completely wrong (Obersoldaten Stg44 for example are not a long range upgrade but a short to medium range upgrade). You can also consult coh2-stats.com for some unit statistics so you can at least see what range they are better at (you can also compare two squads against each other there); I am not sure if the site is always 100% accurate and some stats may be missing, but it should be good enough in many situations.  The start can be a bit unforgiving, but if you have some patience it should get better over time.  There are some balance issues in this game, some are rather bad, so be warned."
CompanyOfHeroes,3604ha,gokkel,1 point,Fri May 15 12:47:04 2015 UTC,"Everything eventually just clicks.  Watch clips of good players.    Learn what every faction is capable of at every point of the game and what they will probably do to counter what you are doing.  This alone probably helps the most with any RTS game.    Once you start getting better you will be able to watch replays and see what you did wrong.  You will see blatant mistakes you made because the fog of war was confusing you just like scouting in Starcraft.    This game depends on micro and placement more so than in Starcraft.  I know micro is still important there but here it is everything.  Macro in Starcraft is tougher whereas with CoH2 it is pretty easy to learn, but the micro and map movement are pretty damn important and really the source of fun with CoH.  Maybe you should start this game by playing allies since they have an early game advantage that revolves around spamming rifle squads with good micro to overwhelm the Germans.  Proper micro of rifle squads is a pretty useful skill to have.  Also post a replay so you can get critiques."

This alone probably helps the most with any RTS game.   This sounds easy in theory but to actually put that into practice is another thing entirely. I get that different units perform better in different range of the enemy and that I should always use cover but even with that in mind I tend to get completely destroyed. I dont know if it's the RNG element that puts me off but sometimes it feels as if the enemy can 1-shot kill anything I throw at them while I need 5-10 shots at least to even have a chance of killing anything of theirs. I try to think about what mistake I made, if any other unit would've been better or if I straight up should have stayed away from that position on the map but I am never sure. When I do win a battle I am just as clueless to why it worked that time as opposed to other times. I will take your advice and look at some replays to see if I can spot any mistakes.

Mass infantry early game and cap most of the map with superior map awareness and micro then make T34/SSU76. I dont know how the mmr system works here but after watching replays of my first few games, low mmr opponents are incredibly slow and seem to have a hard time dealing with split pushing and multi-proned attacks.

They are weak early game which combined with you being a new player results in you getting steamrolled.  With Americans you can spam riflemen in early and do well for example. Sort of the same with soviets. Germans need positioning and combined arms in early to survive which is harder to get a hang of in the beginning. I'm not saying allies don't need that either but their units are stronger and cheaper in early so they are somewhat more forgiving.  Don't even try to play OKW at the start they are very specific, the weakest in early as well. As a result they require some knowledge of the game."

CompanyOfHeroes,35y36r,velmarg,5,Thu May 14 14:02:19 2015 UTC,"Conscript, Conscript, Conscript. Never worth it to not go this start.  If you're facing Wehrmacht or having to deal with buildings, queue Molotov next. If you're up against OKW and a pesky Kube, go AT nades (these will serve you well against the Flaktruck or Puma if it shows, too). Right after this is done, get T2 next and a Maxim.  Next is usually special infantry (Guards or Shocks), then a ZiS. If the game is going relatively well (or at least, if you've avoided a lot of manpower bleed), getting a fuel cache up wouldn't hurt. If youre up against Wehrmacht and they're bunkering hard, you may want to queue the ZIS first here.  If youre getting an ISU, go T3. In the current build, one thing I've realized is for Soviet T3 to work out, you need-need-need to get a fuel cache up. Not only so the the T34 or T70 can hit the field faster, but so you don't too long delay your late game callins. I generally go T70 against Wehrmacht unless they have a P4 out. T34 is brutal against OKW - if they schrek blob, just drive into it and drive in circles. The T34 also supports the ISU very well, and a ram plus a well timed bombing run can demolish heavy German armor.   Also, against OKW, the moment you get your ISU on the field you're almost guaranteed to eliminate the Schwer HQ. 2-3 shots from the ISU from plus one bombing run. Wait and time the bombing run ideally when he tries to repair it with his Sturm for some easy wipe.  It's also worth noting that the Conscript Repair you get with the Shock Motor commander significantly increases the usability of the T34, so much so that I would only build T34s with a commander that has this ability.   If you go IS2, get T4 and an SU85 to support it. This way, a faster German tank won't be able to just do laps around your IS2 without taking a beating from a distance. Keep the SU85 and ZIS close together for maximum efficiency. These two units together will also absolutely WRECK an OKW Schwer HQ.  Most players, especially new or learning players, will have much more success with T2 than T1. Snipers require a great deal of micro and cost a lot of manpower, and besides being able to counter a Kube very early on, the Scout Car has limited effectiveness without some serious micro.  If you DO want to go T1, two commanders that work very well with it are Guard Motor and Lend Lease. Guard Motor because Guards in a Scout Car can absolutely wreck Pumas, Flaktruck and German Scout cars - Lend Lease because you'll get a DSHK call in and it's one of the few commanders where you can tech T1 and get MGs without having to tech T2 as well. In fact, you can go Lend Lease and do no teching period and still have machine guns and relatively fast armor in the very capable M4C Sherman.  Go forth. Yevgeny! Show them the spirit of a true Soviet warrior!  Edit: Added stuff."

CompanyOfHeroes,35y36r,halcyon950,3,Sat May 16 15:53:31 2015 UTC,"Something I do thats kinda small is put down s-mines on strategic points that are kinda far off. These are the points (like top left of faymonville) that people absentmindedly send squads to cap or harass because there's almost never a squad there. That means they're unlikely to see the s-mines.   I also like to put them in areas that can't be seen easily like behind trees or houses, or weird crevices. That means that retreating or flanking squads are likely to hit them, and its harder to avoid them.  I heard that putting soviet tm-35 mines in front of door houses can be a cheap way to wipe falls or jaegers."
CompanyOfHeroes,35y36r,Wasteland_Ranger,3,Thu May 14 15:47:38 2015 UTC,"This strategy covers the Lightning War Doctrine  Stage 1: I usually get 4 Grenadiers. After that I get 2 mortars to put sustaining fire on Ivan/Uncle Sam. This also helps me cover my retreat if my army can't take it anymore. I ALWAYS head towards and cap the Fuel and VP's first. Always remember to build a medic bunker beside your base to heal injured units. Use the sprint ability to quickly re-seize areas captured by the enemy.  Stage 2: Augment 2 grenadiers with MG-42's, and arm 2 Grenadiers with G-43's. Dedicated HMG teams are too slow for this Doctrine, they take too long to set up and to move around. You'd want a unit who's armed with the same type of weapon but a bit more mobile. If you don't have a Pak gun already, then make at least two. Prepare yourself if you know that the enemy will be requisitioning T-34's, use your Paks to destroy them or requisition Panzergrenadiers and arm them with Panzerschreks. Lock down Fuel and VP's with Machinegun Bunkers to buy yourself some time to heal and reinforce injured units. At this point you should also be building fuel caches already to prepare for Stage 3, It also doesn't hurt to build munitions caches as well. I never get Scout cars since they're like paper and I think they're just a waste of resources since it can't even wipe out squads, even with the autocannon upgrade. As for half-track I'd only use it as a mobile reinforce point if I don't feel like retreating or the base is too far.  Stage 3: At this point you should have your first Tiger out in the field already, use it carefully, and punch holes through enemy defenses. Call in AT Strafing Runs on AT Guns or enemy Armor attempting to flank your tiger. If and once you have more resources to spare call in your second Tiger, at this point the enemy force have probably been broken and scattered by now, so push towards their base. Use your Tigers to take out the MG Nests/Bunkers guarding their base while escorting your tigers with infantry.  Critique me if I missed anything there, this is the aggressive strategy I employ but it requires lots and lots of patience. Take the time to build up your strength, and caution is always the better part of valor so remember to retreat your units if they're at half health. They need Veterancy for now, not to wipe out squads."

Seriously though - the T34 has to stand absolutely still to hit anything (use the S key liberally), so it isn't a great counter in that way to a pack of Shrecks. Push your infantry up and drive the T34 into their ranks and do laps. The infantry won't be able to fire the Shrecks or even their rifles at your infantry as your crush them under the might of Soviet steel.  Obviously is he has any more dedicated AT like a Racketen or a JP4, that'll complicate things. If you're gonna play T34 against OKW, prioritize these targets to give your tank crush freedom."

CompanyOfHeroes,35vrfh,cplcarlman,0,Thu May 14 21:24:58 2015 UTC,I know the comparison I'm making.  But it just seems that most Allied armor is specialized (either good against infantry OR armor) while most Axis armor seems to be much more effective against all targets.
CompanyOfHeroes,35vrfh,Mandarion,1 point,Thu May 14 21:57:54 2015 UTC,"And again, the data does not support that fact. The Sherman is slightly below the Panzer IV in terms of AP performance, and extremely outplays him in terms of HE performance. The T34/76 is quite a lot cheaper, and performs accordingly - the T34/85 on the other outperforms the Panzer IV in terms of AP and HE capabilities.   The Panther and the T34/85 are almost on the same level, with the Panther excelling at higher vets in terms of AP, while the T34/85 still has the capability of hitting hard against infantry.   The Tiger I and the IS-2 have been changing quite a lot over the past 16 months, but as it stands now the IS-2 outperforms the Tiger in almost every aspect aside from accuracy - engaging at long rangers won't do you much good, otherwise it is superior to the Tiger I.  The other tanks can't be directly compared to each other (aside from the doctrinal tank destroyers) as they are too different to say ""This one's better!"". I personally even prefer the way the American system works, as it makes you much more deadly - Shermans run around on their one-shotting sprees while your M36s will keep any tank at bay."
CompanyOfHeroes,35vrfh,Ptarted,2,Fri May 15 01:03:37 2015 UTC,"Id like to see some things that relate to the post game overview.

Allied WINS spread = 1.15 / Allied LOSSES spread = .65 Average damage dealt by each team. Include the average damage dealt for total wins and then a second average damage dealt in losses   Hopefully with more post game stat averages, we could determine under what circumstances that Allied/Axis wins or loses. For example; we might see if most of the Axis wins are by a substantial margin (indicated by large spread and higher average damage dealt, and the Allied wins are by slim spreads and only marginally higher or even lower damage dealt.  What Im saying might be a little confusing, but the goal is to get insight not just into wins vs losses, but better understand what happened to reach that outcome. Do allies win more but by a slim margin? Do allies have to sacrifice large amounts of units in order tog get a victory? Does Axis have to deal more damage in the course of a game to get a win? How many units are often killed in a loss for axis? How many fewer units are lost in a win?  Theoretically it will give us much more on the balance rather than just wins and losses, it will also give us an idea on what it takes to achieve victory."

CompanyOfHeroes,35vrfh,Ptarted,1 point,Thu May 14 22:07:34 2015 UTC,"But how could you somehow get kill and death numbers from just wins, losses and damage dealt... You'd at least  need him to post the kills and deaths too...  Ideally when tracking he'd record their faction, win or loss, units killed and lost, doctrine used, and a few other things people have suggested. If he clumps all the data together though, like only posts total kills/deaths for axis, then we'll have no way of separating the kills they got in losses vs wins.   You can't take unspecific data and break it down even more, that's not howbiy works. Conclusions reached from data can only be as specific as there source, so the more specific and individualized his data is, the more conclusions that can be drawn."

CompanyOfHeroes,35vrfh,shitfit_,0,Thu May 14 23:29:50 2015 UTC,Ranking doesn't play a big part in matchmaking. I've been ranked against <10000 and sub 100s just today.
CompanyOfHeroes,35vrfh,Chukonoku,2,Fri May 15 02:55:44 2015 UTC,"That mostly depends on how long you leave the search. If the game matches you on the first minute, it tends to be really balanced, but after 5 mins, it will just broaden up the search way too much.  The point of this is just to show how many ""real"" balanced games (skillwise) are been played on automatch."
CompanyOfHeroes,35vrfh,Gdott,0,Fri May 15 04:04:17 2015 UTC,Not many. There aren't a lot of CoH2 players so you're most likely to jut get matched with the first team available.

CompanyOfHeroes,35vrfh,Ptarted,1 point,Wed May 13 23:15:21 2015 UTC,Damage dealt and units killed/lost is somewhat unreliable. Killing a tank is a lot more damage than killing a whole squad of infantry and counts as one unit lost IIRC while a whole squad of conscripts would be 6.  If you have a team relying on infantry they are suffering more losses than a tank heavy/mixed gameplay.

CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,Account_Eliminator,6,Wed May 13 13:21:14 2015 UTC,"I feel the game is in a place where Allies have an advantage when allowed to maneuver and Axis have an advantage when able to force a frontal engagement.    In most 1v1 and 2v2 maps there are multiple flanking and cut-off maneuvers available. While in most 3v3+ maps, frontal engagements are unavoidable and the closest thing to flanking you can do is ganging up to frontally engage a smaller force on one side of the map."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,AsskickMcGee,2,Wed May 13 16:38:14 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I think openness really favors the allies
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,draje175,3,Wed May 13 16:41:01 2015 UTC,"Personally I like openness as axis as its piss annoying moving no turret tanks around corners (jagdpanzer, jagdtiger, elefant). The heavier the clutter the more i want to stay out. I'd much prefer an open area where i can spot stuff without having LOS blockers everywhere. Heavy clutter (forests/buildings) favors mobile medium tanks more, and allies have plenty of those."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,nichts_neues,2,Wed May 13 22:23:40 2015 UTC,"Not to mention Axis, OST especially, have a distinct long range advantage at the start of the game. Nothing worse than rounding a corner and facing a Riflemen or USF combat engineers with a Grenadier team."

CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,draje175,0,Wed May 13 23:31:56 2015 UTC,That's fair. I'm not really sure which is better since I do great on some urban maps and great on some open
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,2,Wed May 13 22:25:50 2015 UTC,"TBH it can swing. SUPER open sucks because you cant guard everywhere (pavlovs), semi open with cover on certain sides rocks because its possible to cover 2 flanks while having open areas without LOS blocks to point your TDs at (middle of lienne), Cluttered areas suck for non-turret tanks (stalingrad, any map with million buildings), but stuffy chokepoint areas with narrow pathways rock for non-turret tanks (lazure factory sorta, la gauze ambush middle/right side). There's pros and cons for both types, simply depending on the layout.   Map design is just so massive that some maps are almost auto win/lose depending on team comps, and is imo one of the biggest issues with balance."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,AsskickMcGee,1 point,Wed May 13 22:32:40 2015 UTC,"where Allies have an advantage when allowed to maneuver and Axis have an advantage when able to force a frontal engagement   Hardly the case. Exact opposite if anything. USSR core AT is Zis and SU-85, both forward facing weapons that are vulnerable to flanking. Think about how many rounds involve panthers trying to run around enemy SU-85's or walls of Zis.   As for the 3v3 and 4v4 matches, it's more the fact that Germans have superior late game tanks. However, the German tanks are more oftenly outnumbered and thus outgunned, which is not the case in matches with multiple axis players coordinating together. Combine that with the slow duration of 3v3 and 4v4 matches and you have more time to put out better, more expensive tanks. This is especially a problem for USF, whose tanks are all fragile. IS-2s and Tigers can soak up fire for some duration while a Jackson will have trouble when it becomes a 3v3 situation in a late game match with 3 axis players targeting your tanks."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,msdrahcir,2,Thu May 14 17:57:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there comes a point in any game where vehicles have to exchange fire. In 1v1, an Allied tank can trade a round with an Axis one then run away with half health. In a 4v4, several Allied tanks may exchange a volley of fire with multiple Axis tanks, with a guaranteed Allied tank death with every volley."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,iTzDusty,4,Thu May 14 18:04:51 2015 UTC,It's legit. -_- a lot of work lol. I wanted to see if allies were better because I kick ass with allies and get wrecked with axis. I noticed it happening in tournaments too. So I decide to get a small sample set.
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,MolotovFromHell,2,Wed May 13 14:37:39 2015 UTC,if only Relic just published these stats
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,basedyonder,15,Thu May 14 04:35:19 2015 UTC,These stats are fairly in line with tournament results (allies being picked in VP decider matches)
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,MolotovFromHell,1 point,Wed May 13 06:47:32 2015 UTC,"At least from what I've seen in Romeo's SCK, I would agree. I did not include his games since they are 1v1 customs, but it seems like allies win a lot unless the axis is just way better."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,ryanman,4,Wed May 13 16:49:21 2015 UTC,"Assuming these stats are on the level, did the previous patch really tilt the balance that much?  It would fit my experience after the patch. I play with a friend of mine 2v2 and with Germans after patch we dropped from around 300 to 2500+. Although we got a hang of it now and we are coming back we are now 1000 ish. Allies for us stayed at same level as before 200-300 although we've been playing Germans mostly to try to regain rank.  Give a month or two more for people to adapt more to the patch and maybe the stats will be more in balance, at least this seems to be the case for us."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,T_A_R,9,Wed May 13 13:35:54 2015 UTC,"did the previous patch really tilt the balance that much?   It wouldn't surprise me. Despite the usual ""Axis are OP"" drivel, Allies did already have a clear advantage over Axis, there's a reason why the player with the VP lead in best of 3 matches picked Allies (and still does) most of the time.  Edit: Typo"
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,draje175,4,Wed May 13 13:56:28 2015 UTC,We would pick allies as well no doubt. Double Soviets to be precise. In our opinion most well rounded and strong early game as well as can put up a fight late game if it gets to it.
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,Nullclast,4,Wed May 13 14:24:26 2015 UTC,"I think the difference is that you'll have a lot of kids who love playing 4v4s (who doesn't) but who don't have the mental stamina to handle a 1v1 or 2v2 complaining ""Axis OP"" cause they have to handle two king tigers at once. 1v1 and 2v2 has always been pretty close to balanced, but right now playing as Axis in those modes requires you to play really well."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,ZarnoLite,2,Wed May 13 14:54:19 2015 UTC,These stats were the same before the patch
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,iTzDusty,4,Wed May 13 14:32:09 2015 UTC,"A good observation, do you have any opinion on why Allies are winning so many more games?  Is it down to more experienced players sticking with allies and learning to play from when they were inferior to Axis teams, or maybe have allies been buffed too much? maybe even German players not being used to their units being weaker."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,ZarnoLite,3,Wed May 13 14:38:49 2015 UTC,"Focusing on 2v2, and not 1v1, I think allies win because of the core nature of their design.   Ostheer have in general powerful core units, with commanders that sort of help. Soviets Have mediocre core units, with /AMAZING/ doctrine choices. However they have to choose what to go, and they miss out on otherstuff. In 2v2, you get both of both worlds. Soviets can go shock + guard motor, and field an amazing amount  Shock trooper, guard rifle, 120 mortar, mark target, Flame tank, double t34/85 callin, and is2  Thats literally all they need, it covers every base with the BEST units in that field. Ostheers army is more complete naturally, and simply doesn't gain much by teaming up. Instead its just combined arms with more already combined arms, you don't really fill any holes.  OKW has its own issue where its early/mid game is abusable, and sucks unless it has more people fielding for it until it hits its power units with vet.  And Americans are a bitch to push out and can just make late game just not come. In 3s especially, they also make double soviet americans a bitch, adding airborne to the shock/guard combo, and giving jacksons + p-47 allowing the ally team to melt heavy tanks (p47 run on a mark target with jacksons firing at it will make a KT look like a stuart)  I think there needs to be a limit of 1 heavy tank per player (won't really affect 1v1 too much) so 4v4s aren't just axis mega tank army. Then, both okw and ostheer can get the buffs they need. As well nerf soviet commanders and buff the core units (just a little), and maybe have a look at early vs late game strength of americans (just a teeny bit)"
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,Tetracyclon,3,Wed May 13 22:57:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly as a german player I can't keep up with conscript spam, combined arms is still a joke unless the maps have good choke points."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,ZarnoLite,1 point,Fri May 15 09:03:44 2015 UTC,"I really have no idea. When I play allies I do better than when I play axis. What I notice is that shockrifle frontline tactics is almost always picked if soviets are in the game. It has literally everything you'd want. In addition, Volks and Grens are slightly weaker in the early game so Axis tends to lose out on map control. This translates to more resources for allies. For soviets especially, they are much more efficient because they dont have battle phases or trucks to place AND they can only spend their munitions on call ins and abilities. Axis HAS to spend munitions on grens/volks/obers for them to even stand up to allied infantry. Shock troops are also very strong for 2CP, but I don't think they're OP.   I will say that the axis MGs are pretty bad. I did some custom game tests and the MG42 takes on average 3-4 bursts to suppress a unit. The Maxim usually does it in 1, maybe 2. That coupled with the fact that axis doesnt have smoke really bums me out.  finally, in my opinion, soviets dont suffer late game as much as they should in 2v2. is2 can 1v1 a tiger 50% of the time. But in 4v4s they get raped so...lol idk how to balance"

This could prove useful to see whether CAS or Tank Hunter are changing the victory chances. Im interested in Elite Troops tbh. Seems OP as fuck.  Thats pretty much what Id be interested in to be honest. Although I know it's more work, it would be awesome if you could do this. Also, you dont need such big samples.

CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,Rumsies,2,Wed May 13 18:58:10 2015 UTC,It's a shame you didn't include what percentage of games ended in surrender. It would be interesting to see which of the factions surrender the most.
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,VOX_Studios,7,Wed May 13 11:37:47 2015 UTC,Kind of irrelevant to what he was trying to achieve though.
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,Johnny_G93,2,Wed May 13 12:45:36 2015 UTC,Well historically... ;).
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,Malaysia_flight_370,2,Wed May 13 20:49:13 2015 UTC,I really should have now that I think of it lol  Edit: the problem is surrenders bring up the question of who would have won not who did win. Surrenders when you have 2 vp and they have 498 count the same as surrenders when you surrender at a 250 to 250. Maybe you could've made a come back. Maybe not. The point isn't who would've/should've won. It's who did win.
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,Shadowx93ca,3,Wed May 13 14:32:29 2015 UTC,"You are a legend, hopefully this silences the ""Axis are OP"" loudmouths, and we can hope to see some rebalancing in favour of axis again. These stats should be 50/50 accross the board or as close as possible and it's nowhere near that."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,DeathandtaxesFYL,1 point,Wed May 13 15:09:47 2015 UTC,"The problem is this is ONLY for 2v2. In 4v4 axis completely dumpsters. But in 1v1 Allies absolutely wreck. It's hard to balance around that many game types. Actually win rates for ALL 2v2s might be closer to 60/40 I think, but it still shows that allies win more 2v2 than axis"
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,Malaysia_flight_370,2,Wed May 13 16:31:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, but at least get one of the gamemodes right. Now by trying to please everybody they are pleasing nobody. Balance 2v2 and 1v1 at the very least. And judge how that affects 3v3 and 4v4 then. And in 4v4 vs all soviets I wonder is it quite even because they can deal with german armour, is it just Americans having no heavy tanks that ruin the balance there?"
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,jaded_old_IT_guy,2,Wed May 13 16:55:51 2015 UTC,I think Germans are best late games an 4v4 always goes late game because of increased income. That's why it's in their favor IMO
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,F1SH_T4C0,1 point,Wed May 13 17:03:00 2015 UTC,"I think that's part of the reason you hear so many people complain ""Axis OP"".  For every 2v2 that the Allies win easily, there is a 4v4 where the Axis crush just as much.  So there are double the players experiencing the 4v4 balance(8 players in a 4v4, 4 players in a 2v2), assuming the 2 modes are played equally."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,jaded_old_IT_guy,-5,Thu May 14 06:37:35 2015 UTC,"I don't feel like starting a shit storm right now, so I'll leave it at this: without more info, you can't draw any conclusions from this."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,Rumsies,8,Wed May 13 16:30:51 2015 UTC,"Actually, you can. That's how sample sets work. With 1000 games, you can more than safely make an educated conclusion. You can't say that Allies win 67% of games, but you absolutely can say allies win more than axis. Across all 2v2 I would guess its probably closer to 60/40, but that doesn't change the conclusion: Allies win more 2v2s than Axis. That is 100% acceptable as a conclusion and this is enough data to support that."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,jaded_old_IT_guy,-8,Wed May 13 16:43:06 2015 UTC,"There are other variables that are contributing to these results and a blanket statement of saying allies win more than axis is not doing this data any justice.  Faction composition (xx vs yy), map selection, player rank, region, time, etc. will all play a role in this.  EDIT: It's a good start, but we need more details to draw any significant conclusions."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,Rumsies,5,Wed May 13 16:54:32 2015 UTC,"You need more info to draw specific conclusions. 1000 games that are randomly matched by Relic accounts for all variables. Maps are not a variable when they are randomly selected. Statistically they would all be chosen around the same number of times, especially given that there are common vetoes. There are maps that favor allies and maps that favor axis. But since maps are randomly selected it has little affect on this data. I'm not sure you quite understand how statistics works. Since it was one of my majors, take me word for it.  ""Allies win more 2v2 than axis"" is an objectively 100% valid and acceptable conclusion after 1000 random auto matches. Your opinion on its validity is not relevant. Try contributing to the rest of the thread constructively."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,IThrowPower,-5,Wed May 13 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"I can imagine I'm not going to make much headway here, but->   Maps are not a variable   Maps are entirely a variable!  Not in regards to being randomly selected, but the type of maps in the playlist itself.  Are they urban, open, etc.?  Ex: if urban favors Axis and most of the playlist is urban, the data will be skewed towards Axis victory (apply the same thing for types that favor Allies).  You need to know what types of maps are in play (and what maps were played).   1000 games that are randomly matched   You can't even conclude that the matching is entirely random because you don't know Relic's matching algorithm.  I think I get what you were trying to say, but I can say the same thing about not knowing the algorithm behind selecting who you spectate (it could be based on connection, which would then skew you towards regional data).   especially given that there are common vetoes   You can't say that without the data.  Some people don't even bother with vetoes.  It's a factor that would need to be accounted for (I didn't even think of that before)."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,jaded_old_IT_guy,6,Wed May 13 17:26:33 2015 UTC,"I'll concede all of that data is important, but all of that data explains WHY allies are winning more. I agree that if urban maps favor allies and urban maps are 65% of the ones chosen, that's important. What it doesnt change is the fact that allies are winning more random auto matches. None of that data would change the fact that allies are winning more, it just explains why. It would reveal the biases, but it doesn't change the actual conclusion. You could then say Allies are winning more because maps favor them, but it doesn't change the fact that they are winning more.  I think we're disagreeing on different points actually lol. I would love to collect all that data but I just dont have that time. You're looking for the why and how, and I'm just focusing on the end results. I'm not arguing balance of maps and factions of the game, just that 2v2s with all their given variables are most often won by allies."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,jaded_old_IT_guy,-2,Wed May 13 17:36:32 2015 UTC,"So what I think you're saying:   Based on this data, Allies are winning more games.   And what I think I'm saying:   Based on this data, Allies are winning more games, but we don't know why and we don't know if this data is representative of the entire population."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,Rumsies,5,Wed May 13 18:04:45 2015 UTC,Seems fair. i would agree its not totally representative but I would argue that it is representative enough to get a general idea.
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,jaded_old_IT_guy,3,Wed May 13 18:11:09 2015 UTC,"Maps are entirely a variable!   The maps being randomly selected removes this surely. Sometimes a map comes up that favours axis, sometimes it comes up and favours allies. The random choosing of the maps  eliminate maps as something that could favour either faction as it's entirely random.   You can't even conclude that the matching is entirely random because you don't know Relic's matching algorithm   Matches aren't random overall, but random inside an elo bracket. But it doesn't matter, the elo system takes care of and differences in skill, as best as it can.    You can't say that without the data. Some people don't even bother with vetoes.   Doesn't matter again as the maps are chosen randomly. In a small sample size the maps may have a bigger difference but over a 1000 games you get a more accurate representation of the data. Plain and simple. If you watched 10000 games you would not get drastically different results, only home in slightly more on what is the true true value. Allies may actually only win 66% of games or they may win 68%, but the change in value will not be drastic."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,Rumsies,-3,Wed May 13 17:36:40 2015 UTC,"Maps are entirely a variable!   ->   Not in regards to being randomly selected, but the type of maps in the playlist itself.   If a specific type of map is biased and 75% of the playlist is that type of map, you will have biased results.  I'm saying that it might not be entirely random and that would be the problem.   Matches aren't random overall, but random inside an elo bracket. But it doesn't matter, the elo system takes care of and differences in skill, as best as it can.   I'll concede that the algorithm tries to pair similarly skilled players (but note that it runs into issues with mixed skill teams), but I was more referring to how OP was being matched into game for spectating.  He's just watching so it probably wouldn't include his skill as a factor.  An example would be if it used good connection as a priority, then the majority of the matches he spectated would be in his region, so the data would be region specific and not global.   You can't say that without the data. Some people don't even bother with vetoes.   What I was trying to get at here is that there could be a trend with vetoing.  Do some players use specific strategies (known to work) on certain maps?  Do non-vetoed maps favor one side or the other?  It's hard to put into words, but it boils down to a mix of map bias and (mainly meta) player knowledge."
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,jaded_old_IT_guy,7,Wed May 13 18:16:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not looking for any shitstorms either, and on closer inspection I may be jumping to conclusions with my original statement so what more data do you think we need? I guess it could be that allied players are generally more skillful, but shouldn't elos be matched then that discounts that. Idk what do you think?"
CompanyOfHeroes,35sz0f,Rumsies,-3,Wed May 13 16:52:34 2015 UTC,"The only way I can give you a definitive answer is if we had more detailed data.  How close were these games?  A 1 VP difference could basically be considered a tie.  Things like that.  If we had more info, we could draw better conclusions/theories.  For the rest I'm going to copy my reply to another comment (let me know if you'd like for me to elaborate more):   There are other variables that are contributing to these results and a blanket statement of saying ""allies win more than axis"" is not doing this data any justice.

CompanyOfHeroes,35t6wv,Todda468,2,Wed May 13 08:34:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about specific maps, I'll have to look which ones I have downloaded. I do kind of like these kinds of maps, partially because it focuses the action in a specific place which tends to be more fun than chasing that one squad that snuck behind your lines.   But at the same time it can create situations where units just butt heads without making progress. And if there is more than one of these stalemate points, the winning team doesn't have much motivation to push forward, though this could be countered by giving terrain advantages to the side that is closer that that particular defense point.  Personally, I enjoy maps that are a bit narrow, with clearly defined areas and moderate amount of defensive positions, my favorite being Rails and Metal. It gives each side some unique terrain or ways to attack and defend, and I find that it is just the right size that your forces aren't as divided as when the map is divided diagonally."

CompanyOfHeroes,35s1wu,thefonztm,3,Wed May 13 14:38:24 2015 UTC,"There is a very large conflict of interest in improving the drop system for relic.   On one hand it would make the game more enjoyable for players and maybe stimulate more sales of the base game due to positive word of mouth.  On the other hand relic is more likely to make money of selling commanders in the current system, or so they think at least.  It looks like nobody at relic is willing to take a leap of faith and improve the system. Simply because if they earn less then before they can't revert back to the previous model unless they want to risk some serious community backlash. Also probably whoever makes the new system and gets this outcome is likely to get fired.   Most current game studios are more interested in making money in the short term then trying to improve the game and generate more money in the long term by creating positive perception of the game.  Because of the above reasons I highly doubt anything will change, at least as long as they keep generating an acceptable amount of money from current system."
CompanyOfHeroes,35s1wu,MolotovFromHell,1 point,Wed May 13 16:30:04 2015 UTC,"Hmmm... that's interesting. Technically you can get all the commanders and I have actually gotten a fair number of premium ones, but that's because I've invested some time. The problem that annoys most people is the sheer number of duplicates and wanting to get specific commanders; these people are going to be very disappointed. Perhaps adding in more cosmetic and collector's items would alleviate the problem of duplicates; for example I don't care if I get a jagdtiger dispatch 10% faster bulletin as long as it's something I don't have yet."

With that said, I have to admit that I went ahead and bought two of the cheaper commanders that I wanted to play with, so in that sense, Relic might like it more than we do. Something that affects gameplay so much should be far easier to attain without paying money, at least for a game that we had to pay for upfront. And since duplicates are allowed to drop, there is no guarantee that you'll ever unlock all of them, even after many thousands of hours of play.   I'm hoping that they revise the system. There have been little hints here or there that it might be changed in the future, but nothing concrete.  Edit: It would be interesting to know if people are still paying money to unlock things. I can imagine Relic waiting until sales have dropped off, and then opening up new ways to acquire Commanders and bulletins, such as making them tradable."

I don't believe that dlc should be given away for free, so Its honestly pretty surprising that relic has a system that does just that.  Its not a pretty system, but I have won all wfa commanders, several skins, and many commanders for base armies that I otherwise would not have bought or would have bought. I literally have had nothing but gains from war spoils. It doesn't take away, it only gives. It may give a lot of worthless stuff, but over time you get nothing but dlc.  Bulletins are worthless to begin with, and if you didnt unlock all base commanders before introduction of war spoils last year or are a new player than I feel you. Other than that you have no excuse. You are not entitled to free dlc, yet this game gives it to you. You people are all lucky we have a free slot machine for dlc to begin with."

The Panther from OH came 3 minutes before the game ended.  The enemy tried to double first my mate and after that came to my side. Rinse and repeat. We were pushed back to base until we had about 220 VP and made a last ditch effort to capture at least one VP to prolong the fight. This succeeded and we were able to get hold of one VP. The USF player blobbed riflemen and an Ostwind, supplementing the Jagdpanzer dealt with them pretty nicely. So we got hold of the second VP and were able to push the enemies back into the sea/to moscow - in bodybags. Intense 46minute game with lots of action."

CompanyOfHeroes,35qyl5,draje175,2,Wed May 13 15:54:39 2015 UTC,"yeah its a beast but to be fair. the chance of losing a Jagdpanzer is quite high. It has the worst mobility of any medium tank in the game and as soon as any tank gets behind/next to it it's dead. so it evens it out. Jagdpanzers are microintensive, rather hard to get to vet 5 if the enemy is even remotely competent and it needs support. unlike other mediums which you can use to poke in the enemy and get away with it the Jpz is dead. It is a strict anti tank hunter. a mobile pak just like the M36 Swagson it just trades mobilty and turret for armour."

CompanyOfHeroes,35qyl5,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,12,Tue May 12 20:45:44 2015 UTC,"A big thing is their vet is so good that the penalty is when units come out fresh they are not very good for the cost. It lends them to having a piss poor time till they have a solid combination of vetted units out.  A vet 5 jgdpzIV will crush a vet 3 su85, but vet 0 both is an rng battle when the 85 costs less. Same with others, a vet 0 ober can lose to a vet 0 guard while costing more, where as by the time it gets vet 3-4 the ober should crush  As a result unit conservation for okw is probably more impactful than for the other armies"

CompanyOfHeroes,35qyl5,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,5,Tue May 12 21:36:14 2015 UTC,"OKW does have quite a few good units but in return their roster is lackluster in certain areas. In a vacuum OKW units seem to excel but then again so does any other unit (apart from pioneers maybe :D ). For example they lack a medium general purpose tank like the Sherman, Panzer IV, '76,'85. Their vehicles are either heavily armoured (Kingtiger,Panther,Sturmtiger) or very very lightly armoured (Flak HT,Puma). That is a weakness people always miss to exploit in my experience of 2v2. Volksgrenadiere are worst basic infantry and will lose to everything but Combat Engineers, Rear Echelons assuming there is same cover for both units of course. Their supression plattform which is non doctrinal is useless after 6-7 minutes and so on. Frankly they do have units that excel in their role like Obers but in the end that counts for all four factions in certain aspects. I got salty about 120mm Mortars or IS-2s on more than one occasion. But in the end that goes both ways and counts for all factions."
CompanyOfHeroes,35qyl5,Charismaztex,2,Tue May 12 21:32:44 2015 UTC,"Jagdpanzer and SU-85s are actually such sweet Tank Destroyers that vary in form/function. SU-85's forward focus ability can allow it to go into sniper mode and the Jagdpanzer's cautious movement makes it feel like a serious ambush Tank Hunter. It reminds me of an actually functioning retake on the Hetzer from last game. People are just now starting to realize the potency of the Jagdpanzer, but I feel that SU-85's are losing favor to most players, which is disappointing as they can make short work of OKW trucks and pretty much go full automatic at 3 star veterancy."
CompanyOfHeroes,35qyl5,Charismaztex,1 point,Tue May 12 22:56:01 2015 UTC,"I personally still prefer the SU. Just drive it into a nice position, hit ""Focus sight"" and wait for something to drive by. The Jagdpanzer is a bit more complicated, because you will have to spot for it with its sight being so low.  On top of that, a well microed Panther will be more useful than a Jagdpanzer, because in the case of cases you will have higher mobility and can put it against infantry for a while…"
CompanyOfHeroes,35qyl5,ryanman,1 point,Wed May 13 07:03:20 2015 UTC,"Well popping out an SU is so much less of a chore than it is for OKW to pop out a jagd. It's also near nothing losing a SU-85 in comparison to a Jagdpanzer. Because of the game's economics alone, the SU-85 is better. However, on paper, one would prefer the Jagd."
CompanyOfHeroes,35qyl5,TheAshigaru,1 point,Wed May 13 07:19:44 2015 UTC,"And this is the problem with OKW: vet 0 units can lose to their cheaper counterparts depending on RNG. But at high vet they are superior, however this takes a long time. In general there are more opposing armour out."

CompanyOfHeroes,35uqx2,Mandarion,4,Thu May 14 11:37:10 2015 UTC,"Just to argue with data here (some of it may have changed, we have so many different sources which all claim to be accurate, that actually knowing what is right is impossible without diving into the game files, for which I don't have the time):  The Panzer IV of the Ostheer has 640HP/180 armour. (125 Fuel, 350 MP) The Panzer IV of the OKW has 640HP/160 armour. (105 Fuel, 360MP) The M4 Sherman has 640HP/160 armour.  (110 Fuel, 340MP) The T34/76 has 640HP/150 armour. (100 Fuel, 310MP)  Source and armour stats  These four tanks are the closest in terms of equivalency in this game (because asymmetric design). I don't really see the advantage for any faction here, aside from the obvious overpricing on the OKW Panzer IV. Comparing heavy tanks like the Tiger with a tank destroyer like the M36 is inherently prone to uselessness, because one does not simply compare a nail with a nail gun. We could go on to compare the heavies in the game, but even then we would find that the difference is either negligible or even in favour of the Allies, with the IS-2 having more armour than the Tiger I (IS-2 375/1040 vs. Tiger 300/1040 vs. Tiger II 375/1280).  Sorry to disappoint you, but no. If anything, the current state of the game and ""attack moving"" gives tank destroyers (of which only the Allies have proper ones, with the Jagdpanzer IV/70 having less range than both the Jackson and the SU-85, all other ones being doctrinal) an inherent advantage."

Seems like map choice (and spotting) could heavily influence this.   Only the heavy tanks, and it's not limited to Axis tanks in that category (it's just that the USF currently don't have a heavy tank). Especially a Panzer IV shouldn't be used in close quarters on open maps, because you won't have enough time to pull it out if an M36 hits the field - and the M36 practically makes the Panzer IV worthless, because it will have to be constantly repaired, which takes a lot of time for the Ostheer (Ostheer has neither the crazy repair speeds of the OKW and the USF and also no vehicle crews like the USF). And of course the map choice always plays a role - again, this holds true for all factions, because the Allies often profit from more open maps that allow for flanking (even though that isn't even necessary anymore, it just speeds things up) and better usage of range."

Infantry screens are an incredibly basic and common tactic, explained in the following step by step guide: 1. Have AT and inf staging just outside LoS of any possible enemy 2. Make sure AT is facing right way 3. Inf forward 4. A nazi tank fires, maybe gets half your squads models on a good hit 5. Your AT fires from outside the range possible by the axis armor, resulting in him either staying and losing the tank or leaving to avoid damage 6.Depending on your foe's reaction in step 5, either walk past the carcass of a burning tank or walk forward as the enemy armor pulls back  Dumbing down the argument leaves it more prone to holes and in turn criticisms and attacks on your credibility as it is by no means an effective way of comparison. Nor is putting word's in others mouth's. I'm not making any what if situations as every Jackson has greater range than the majority of tanks, every SU too. These are their strengths, play by them or watch them burn.  For example on an urban map, aim TDs down roads, tanks have to use them. If a tank is around a corner that means infantry can get fairly close. US has bazookas for the side/rear (and smoke so don't say you can't just walk up to it because you sure as hell can) while soviets can AT grenade it effectively forcing it to stay in the clearing or retreat down a road. In the mean time you need to bring up another tank (preferably one with a turret) to begin poking away at it. A few shots from a reg t34 on the side hurt, and coming from 2 directions means that he will take rear shots). Sad because he'll kill it if you don't pull back? Thats fine, pull back and repair. He'll have a slowed weakened tank sitting in a known position."

You dont take cost into account, you dont take the versatility into account, you dont seem to account for what is necessary to acquire them...  All in all, this feels redundant and unhelpful in any way, nor does it prove that axis armor is truly better. Sure axis has some phenomenal tanks, but with the cost of them and the time they take, are the TRULY better? Sometimes yes and sometimes no, because while each individual US or RU tank is worse, the can be produced faster and cheaper which is why they aren't as good, its about mass production rather than single units.

CompanyOfHeroes,35nvqo,Zabbiemaster,8,Tue May 12 19:28:59 2015 UTC,"Hi i'm a top 50 okw player in 2v2, I had a lot of problems vs Tank Hunter once the PTRS buff hit, someone already suggested a turtle strat into Obers and Panther but my suggestion would be heavy T2 and T3 play, not setting up your T4.  PTRS bleeds you super hard early game so actually getting to Obers is a difficulty in itself, not only that but if your opponent keeps his conscripts in groups of 2+; a PTRS volley with probably kill an Ober model every time, not only does that bleed you with Obers 50 mp cost but it poops on their DPS output because of the wind up animation on Obers LMG (unless you opt for STG would I guess could work, Command Panther would be good too).  Fusiliers are in my opinion the best way of playing against Tank Hunters, rushing Flak HT gives you pushing power in the early game which Volks just completely lack, sure you'll lose it eventually but Volks and Fusiliers are a perfect screen infantry (low reinforce cost high durability).  Fusiliers scale incredibly well, their vet bonuses are great. A PTRS sniping a model on a 6 man squad is pretty irrelevant unlike sniping an Ober model. The Fusiliers will still win vs conscripts and again they're super efficient manpower wise.  You have a decent amount of leeway with HQ placement vs Tank Hunters too because you know there's no 120mm, aggressively placing behind a shot blocker is pretty safe.   JP4 is a great unit vs doctrinal Soviet players as well as versus PTRS. 230 frontal armour makes it resistant to PTRS as well as it beating SU85s. T34/76 flanks are risky because you have a disable in the form of fusiliers.  Someone also commented on how Tank Hunters has no way of dealing with bigger tanks but a T34 ram into the anti bombing run is insane, which makes JP4 even more ideal given its relatively low cost compared to Panther or KT."
CompanyOfHeroes,35nvqo,Dedow,4,Tue May 12 14:03:56 2015 UTC,"Given you're standing, you definitely know what you're talking about. That said, how do you play the Flak HT when the Con blob is much bigger? I could see surviving against two, but a lot of these guys are blobbing 4 or more and just steamrolling everything in their path. Even MG's can't stop them unless garrisoned because they just destroy the gun."
CompanyOfHeroes,35nvqo,Orestes910,7,Tue May 12 14:17:08 2015 UTC,"Flak HT is as much about buying time and giving you some kind of killing power early game where OKW is at its weakest. With the cover system as it is where squads stack on themselves the Flak HT's wipe potential is pretty ridiculous, and once it hits Vet 1 you get free smoke. PTRS cant attack ground so the smoke is pretty much a second life for your HT.   The HT has great range too, using cheap infantry to provide vision and sponge PTRS hits it just becomes a massive frustration. You're gonna force the Soviet player to tech and then put 320 MP into an AT gun early on which really isn't ideal for them considering how long OKW can last without investing in more armour.  The HT is also going to buy time for your fusiliers to get G43s and Vet up so they get to a point where they just walk circles around PTRS cons.  Also conscript's sandbags are a huge factor in what makes Tank Hunters so strong right now, Flak HT still does good damage vs units in green cover and can destroy the sandbags.  Your point about MGs blowing up vs PTRS is a factor in why I think Fusiliers and an early HT is the way to go."
CompanyOfHeroes,35nvqo,Dedow,3,Tue May 12 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"Great post, and a great point about the smoke. Didn't even think about the absence of attack ground and the good damage vs green cover."
CompanyOfHeroes,35nvqo,Orestes910,2,Tue May 12 14:44:19 2015 UTC,"People expect lone MGs to beat X number of approaching infantry. They wont. They aren't bunkers.  You just need to either overlap or micro your MG (suppress, when blob gets close, pull back and reposition).  3 Volks, Kubel/MG34, Flak Track, MG34. If you Luftwaffe, Falls basically replace your Obers. Survive the T70/T34 rush, and you pretty much won the game since he is just stuck with stock tanks."
CompanyOfHeroes,35nvqo,Chukonoku,2,Tue May 12 14:31:22 2015 UTC,Fusiliers is a nice counter I agree the 6 model squad gives you more survivability vs ptrs alpha.  The flak ht feels like a waste of fuel though. It will be only effective for as long as they don't ptrs which is not long. Even with volks screen they can swarm hoorah into it with the blob and kill it unless you move which makes it do no damage.  It is easier to screen obers with volks then flak ht. You can hold ground with obers until con's get close at which point you most likely dealt a lot of damage and you always can hit retreat while still holding ground and dealing damage. With flak ht you will get at naded if you hold ground at which point its a high stakes bet on who kills each other first the damaged ht with volks doing minor damage or swarm of con's with ptrs and more nades.  I agree with aggressive hqs.  Just my opinion on this. Good advice all around.

CompanyOfHeroes,35nbxu,Doppel8137,2,Tue May 12 19:20:23 2015 UTC,They should start filtering which commander a player already has. I know I've gotten two of the same commanders.

A cheeky nade then can wipe squads. Also throwing nades at doors rather than into the buildings could catch them if your opponent tries to dodge by exiting the buildings.   It does suck that the Soviet Molotov throw is slow to wind up and it's easy to spot. It's more of a way to deny cover and force MGs to relocate than a way to get kills. I'm certainly guilty of moving my cons across open ground to get the Molotov off only to take 4 casualties in the process and have my opponent just move away or not even lose a model. Luckily though the Soviets have munitions to burn so throwing Molotovs a lot is certainly possible (pun intended)."

The ML20 howitzer is awesome and sturmovik attacks are an excellent late game option to break an enemy push or crush defenses. I generally go T4 and get SU85s for hard AT and a katyusha if I need to deal with blobs.

Since he will have little time to notice the squad engaging in combat.  -Multi directional green cover nullifies explosive damage. Directional green cover (sandbags or walls) only applies this benefit is the nade is been thrown up through the cover. Sides or rear will apply maximum damage.

CompanyOfHeroes,35mwut,thefonztm,1 point,Tue May 12 15:16:02 2015 UTC,"IIRC Green/heavy cover is always directional. Yellow/light cover can be directional (IE, fences/crates) or omnidirectional (craters). I don't know if bushes (yellow/light cover) are treated as directional cover or not...  A mortar round landing on the wrong side of cover will be mostly ineffective, a mortar on the right side of cover wipes squads. Kinda wish I knew a bit more about the details, but that is my experience from playing."
CompanyOfHeroes,35mwut,USSZim,1 point,Tue May 12 18:49:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a little confused because /u/Chukonoku said that the directional cover only benefits you if ""the nade is [sic] been thrown up through the cover."" That makes it sound like it matters where the grenade was thrown from rather than where it is when it goes off. I'm going to assume he meant to say that the cover should be between the nade and the squad at the time of detonation in order to get anything from it."
CompanyOfHeroes,35mwut,Chukonoku,1 point,Tue May 12 19:30:51 2015 UTC,"Yea... not 100% on that wording. What matters is where it is when it explodes.

CompanyOfHeroes,35mwut,Chukonoku,1 point,Tue May 12 19:36:48 2015 UTC,"Haha, that sounds like a game-ending situation. I've actually had that happen in some FPS games too, where lag will cause a nade to come out from behind you and hit you in the head."
CompanyOfHeroes,35mwut,thefonztm,1 point,Wed May 13 16:22:14 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't matter* where it lands. The initial position of the squad which is throwing the grenade would determinate if the damage modifier of green cover will take effect or not."
CompanyOfHeroes,35mwut,Chukonoku,1 point,Wed May 13 15:07:09 2015 UTC,"Green cover can be multidirectional (houses, bunkers, trenches, craters made by huge explosions such as demos). Will test later regarding mortar."
CompanyOfHeroes,35mwut,Chukonoku,1 point,Wed May 13 15:02:53 2015 UTC,"Trenches at least are still directional cover. A mortar or grenade landing in the trench will not be blocked. Landing on either side puts cover between the explosion and the squad. Though, for small arms fire I think you'd need to be on the right side of the trench to benefit from cover, see picture.  IDK much about the houses/bunkers. They are certainly multi directional. Wood VS Stone seems to have an effect on how good the cover is too. Wood = light, stone = heavy?  I totally forgot that demo craters give green cover. I don't think many other explosives do that."
CompanyOfHeroes,35mwut,thefonztm,1 point,Wed May 13 15:32:41 2015 UTC,Material of a house only affects integrity. How effective an explosive is against a squad inside a buildings correlates to where the models are sitting at the moment of impact. Smaller buildings are deadly since they are all bunch up most of the time.   Directional cover also applies to mortar shells.  I made the following test:  (A)Conscript|Sandbag --- Sandbag|(B)Conscript --- Mortar with precision strike.   Those in case A receive less damage and survives 100% of the time even if the shells lands pin point. The ones in case B only survive but with low health when i tried to put the shell as far as possible behind the sandbag. That's mostly the case of AoE dropping.
CompanyOfHeroes,35mwut,Chukonoku,1 point,Wed May 13 17:19:26 2015 UTC,"When i'm talking about trenches, i'm referring to the building (like defensive doctrine or Osstruppen). I think that's sandbags you are making the drawing off.   If you throw a grenade with the squad on the left and it lands on the middle, the damage is minimum. If you throw a grenade from the squad on the right and it lands on the middle the damage is huge. Test it and you'll see."

CompanyOfHeroes,35mwut,dumbducky,1 point,Mon May 11 20:48:50 2015 UTC,Molotovs to block access to my ranged units against assault units is great. Block a squad behind a fence and force a retreat or costly fence jump. Molotovs on mortars and machine guns or in retreat choke points are great too.   Line of sight blind grenades are great too. Especially onto capped points where you can see the enemy decapping buy they can't see you.

This is obviously less of an Issue with USF who have less support weapons, but I have done it to Pak Howitzers before too. I've also noticed that I don't even need munitions as much with this Salvage or Spec Ops doctrine, as the ambush grenades only cost 10 muni."

CompanyOfHeroes,35gfh5,1_WHO_1,4,Sun May 10 02:44:29 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you guys would do well as a Wehr/OKW team.   Allies pretty much have to be aggressive and if one player is more so than the other it causes some issues, but personally I cant stand having an SU player with me as I have NEVER done well with one. Something about the two factions just doesnt seem to work as well as both players suing the same faction, that just dont compliment each other.  Axis has the advantage of a strong late game that lends itself to the slow, strategic, methodical type. OKW is a complicated faction to adjust to, but is incredibly powerful when everything is staged out right and resources are made available to them. The wide array of commanders for the Wehr might also help the two of you compliment the other better. Your best bet would probably be to have yourself as Wehr and him as OKW. This way his slow pace will not really affect how OKW would normally play anyway (resource limited, so progress is slow and their early game is quite weak and expensive). You playing as Wehr would be able to adopt a slightly more aggressive style that would allow him time to keep decent pace and focus on the midgame domination.  Basically, you play as a resource capturing spearhead and give your buddy the opportunity to stack up for the tremendous OKW late game. OKW has tremendous defensive capability with their light vehicles ability to choke the enemy inf back, and what he lacks in speed and micro you can make up for. You focus on the early game resource dominance and let him handle the heavy vehicles first.  Works for me with a buddy that does the same thing, give it a try :)  EDIT: I also really like 2v2's so feel free to add me if you ever want to work on some stuff and practice. Steam: Ptartedmonkey"
CompanyOfHeroes,35gfh5,Ptarted,1 point,Sun May 10 04:00:30 2015 UTC,"Luftwaffe/Fortifications  Doctrine for MG34 + Tank Traps is nice for turtling.  Remember base OKW 'barbed wire' also blocks light vehicles, it's great vs half-trucks."
CompanyOfHeroes,35gfh5,Fimconte,1 point,Sun May 10 16:01:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if your friend plays OKW, let him know where he should set up his trucks, and try to make the most use out of them, either healing your troops or repairing your vehicles.   If your friend is newer to the game, he might overcome the turtling as he improves. Sometimes it feels better to not lose any troops, when in reality, you just need to engage efficiently, but it takes time to get used to that.   If he plays OKW, try to encourage him to use his volks to engage at range. He may trade evenly, but he'll be getting XP, and volks are cheap to reinforce.  If he doesn't want to play OKW, then see if he can build all of the resource caches for you while he's turtling."
CompanyOfHeroes,35gfh5,Katter,1 point,Tue May 12 06:20:13 2015 UTC,"while I understand the concept of turtling, especially after you have seized 2/3 VPs, yet I can only strongly advice to not let this become a habit. When I started playing online I lost quite a few rounds because I stopped capping/pushing after getting vps or played to defensively. You open up a window for your enemy to come back. Constant pushing allows you to get more resources and more importantly deny the enemy vital fuel/munitions. I personally feel that denying resources to the enemy is better than getting just more. Why is that? I think that when you reach a certain number of units you can not bring up as much time to micro each unit as you would have to to get the maximum efficency out of them. When you keep army sizes smaller - for both sides - you have a better time microing every unit to full extend resulting in better overall combat efficency and less lost squads overall/better preservation of veterancy/upgrades."

You know that your enemy is going to be converting his fuel into ammo, so tanks are going to be mostly out of the question for him. Expect him to be getting panzergrenadiers with panzershreks.   Focus heavily on AI and AA to shoot down the planes, getting an M3 with the upgraded quad-.50s is a good idea.  Shock troops are a good idea to counter panzer grenadiers as well as other ostheer infantry, so choose a good commander like Shock Rifles."
CompanyOfHeroes,35eeaq,FlyingSMonster,6,Sat May 9 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"Can you actually shoot down the plane before it fires? They only do 1 pass anyway, so shooting it down afterwards doesn't help."
CompanyOfHeroes,35eeaq,BarrierX,3,Sat May 9 16:03:33 2015 UTC,Slim chance if they bring the plane in from the right direction. The quad mount isn't that good at AA either. I personally wouldn't bother investing in AA.

Shocks are playthings to me, because once I have three or four gren squads with LMG's, they're done. The only thing that has consistently defeated my shrek squads with grens in tow has been multiple heavy tanks or allied airplane callins.   Probably shouldn't say that, but I like getting my ass kicked sometimes, so. If I'm rolling at you with the CAS death squad and my airplanes are raping you after the fact, kill my infantry. The planes are useless to me if I can't capitalize on what they do."

I had TWO of those trucks with the .50's on them but the thing is the planes do their damage before the trucks shoot them down. The only one the really can shoot is the recon plane. Both strafing runs are over way to fast and the dive bomber is completely unstopable.  It just sucks that I do so well then the end I just get stomped because he can insta pin my squads and stop a flank or just shread my tanks with a strafe that I can't stop.

CompanyOfHeroes,35eeaq,tightropexilo,2,Sat May 9 19:24:09 2015 UTC,"You may have an easier time with shock rifle commander. CAS strategy usually relies on having 2 or 3 paks, try dropping an incendiary barrage to force them to reposition and striking with your IS2 whilst that is happening. The greater armour of the IS2 is more likely to bounce the pak shots and panzerfausts, making it safer. It is also easier to micro 1 tank rather than two.  I'm not saying guard motor isn't good, just that shock rifle is probably easier to execute."

I couldn't kill the paks with infantry because he had that many MG-42's they just got pinned and the ones that I had flank just got insta pin by the strafe. Then his 3 star grenadiers with MG-42's just picked off the models. My 120mm motars were useless because the moment the fired I'd hear the dive bomber coming down.

CAS means no Tigers so capitalize by stalling into IS2s. Stuka strafe barely scratch them and conversion means you won't see anything stronger than a couple of P4s. Get minesweepers in case he uses excess munies for Tellers and S-mines. Avoid bunching up and try to divide and conquer as much as possible.

CompanyOfHeroes,35eeaq,BarrierX,1 point,Wed May 13 13:39:09 2015 UTC,Also just be sure to keep your AA a bit close to your main army that you're attacking/defending with. That should keep the planes off their backs while they fight or cap a point.
CompanyOfHeroes,35eeaq,MastaKillaSC2,1 point,Wed May 13 13:40:08 2015 UTC,As ost I don't like to use CAS because the strafing runs have a small area and the planes only do one pass.  So when you see the smoke try to quickly move out of the area and they should miss. Or try not to blob so not all of your stuff gets pinned.

That should be a nice starting point, as it will walk you through different strategies, units and commanders so you can have a deeper knowledge about the game.  Also, I recommend watching high level casts, like Romeo's channel, as it will give you a nice insight about the decisions that happen during a game from the perspective of a player that knows what he's doing. You could also try watching the Propagandacast, this channel is more beginner friendly and has a higher focus on casting entertaining and interesting matches, however, the commentary can be sometimes a bit off point and you won't get the same kind of deep and accurate analysis you'd get on Romeo's casts."

CompanyOfHeroes,35f9ro,AzraelApollyon,3,Sat May 9 20:24:28 2015 UTC,Which army and faction do you prefer? We can do a few comp stomps together until you're comfortable enough to play vs real people or a 1v1. Here's my Steam profile.
CompanyOfHeroes,35f9ro,JenkinsEar147,1 point,Sat May 9 21:14:48 2015 UTC,I compstomp a lot to get used to the maps and units.
CompanyOfHeroes,35f9ro,Katter,2,Sun May 10 09:10:04 2015 UTC,"Don't feel obligated to play online, at least not at first. Playing against the computer can be really fun, and you can play against different difficulty bots until you improve. There are lots of good community made maps and mods.   If you have anything specific we can help with, let us know"
CompanyOfHeroes,35f9ro,USSZim,2,Sun May 10 06:45:40 2015 UTC,"One mistake that is very common in CoH is disregarding cover. Cover is super important and can even help you win against superior units sometimes. Check for yellow or green dots whenever possible, that means you will have cover. If you are controlling a group of squads, you can press tab to cycle through them, and order them individually into separate cover."
CompanyOfHeroes,35f9ro,RustyNumbat,2,Sun May 10 09:18:38 2015 UTC,"Always be in cover Never let whole units die, but conversely don't retreat your forces at the drop of a hat. Falling back with regular movement is often very viable, as is holding against bad odds while you rush up some support for a unit. So often players retreat everything, then the opponent knows he has that part of the battlefield to himself for a minute. Never have units sitting around (unless you're happy to be complacent and give the enemy breathing room) and don't get tunnel vision for one particular path/control point. Don't blob multiple infantry units around together. Take the time to move each squad separately over a wider area, blobs die."
CompanyOfHeroes,35f9ro,Doppel8137,1 point,Sun May 10 10:28:48 2015 UTC,I would add think about what you would like your army to look like.  This mean you can determine what your tech building you would like to create. Creating all can be wasteful.   Then determine if you want to have heavy on either fuel or munitions. Creating cashes can be very helpful.   Plus practice makes perfect.   They are right about the guides very useful.
CompanyOfHeroes,35f9ro,tightropexilo,1 point,Mon May 11 00:25:08 2015 UTC,"check out this guide, it has lots of good tips  http://www.coh2.org/guides/31462/tips-and-tricks-for-newbies"
CompanyOfHeroes,35f9ro,daspoulos,1 point,Sat May 9 23:12:56 2015 UTC,Just being able to handle microing multiple units is what got me good. Tactics are only useful if you can handle effectively moving and positioning multiple units in short time frames. So try to keep ur units doing stuff always.
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,Yankee-doodle,2,Sat May 9 02:27:20 2015 UTC,got the same with the usf :D http://www.coh2.org/file/7914/duplis.jpg
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,scratchedpaintjob,1 point,Sat May 9 12:00:49 2015 UTC,I'll trade you my mechanized for your recon
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,USSZim,1 point,Sat May 9 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"You gotta be shitting me, and I can't get one to drop!"
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,Malaysia_flight_370,5,Sat May 9 03:06:16 2015 UTC,I'd give you some but ya know
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,PipeGameLethal,3,Sat May 9 03:36:23 2015 UTC,"Relic said a trade system will come ""soon"". I think this was about a good 13 months ago :D"
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,MolotovFromHell,1 point,Sat May 9 10:24:20 2015 UTC,Seen more. Freaking casuals. /sarcasm
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,ch4os1337,1 point,Sat May 9 08:09:39 2015 UTC,The fuck is this... I've never even seen a red item (or have ever even had a purple) and i'm almost level 90 and 300 hours in.
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,sojou,2,Sat May 9 10:04:35 2015 UTC,"Red was for stuff from the valentines day event, if youre confused about that. Purple is rare enough that 300 hours without seeing one isnt that weird."
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,Mandarion,2,Sat May 9 11:10:25 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, the new ""decal"" system (which was a 800MB download for a single decal). I'd like to know if the person responsible for that just went back to hibernation or died without anyone at Relic noticing..."
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,Matlock0,1 point,Sat May 9 16:40:03 2015 UTC,I played one game against AI couple of days ago after a 1.5 years of break from the game (and have like 30 hours total in it) and I got some purple air strike thing :D.
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,1 point,Sat May 9 11:26:35 2015 UTC,"Red is an event item, purple is an ""epic"" item. So far only a couple victory strikes and one of the faceplates are epic."
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,HauntedGrass,1 point,Sat May 9 18:45:46 2015 UTC,"I really think a crafting system would be cool, 2 commanders = 1 random commander, or 3 intel bulletins = 1 random intel bulletin. Same with skins."
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,Mandarion,4,Sat May 9 12:54:50 2015 UTC,"Wait, you don't want to keep your seven ""OKW sWS has 3% higher top speed"" bulletins?"
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,IBlackKiteI,1 point,Sat May 9 16:41:33 2015 UTC,But that would make too much seeeense
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,1 point,Sun May 10 06:03:42 2015 UTC,What's with the green dot and stop watch on that one?
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,Ivan_Ivanov_Ivansky,1 point,Sat May 9 18:46:46 2015 UTC,It's for the 70th anniversary of Victory day in Europe so they gave you a commander for each faction.(Limited time only)
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,dr-pavel,1 point,Sat May 9 19:30:46 2015 UTC,Just logged on and noticed that. Too bad none of them are good commanders... Defense is okay though.
CompanyOfHeroes,35cwei,juggernauth,0,Sat May 9 19:58:55 2015 UTC,ayy lmao
CompanyOfHeroes,35dyaf,scratchedpaintjob,1 point,Sat May 9 11:57:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this,  got it running at home,  can't wait to see what I net."
CompanyOfHeroes,35dyaf,ForestryTech,1 point,Mon May 11 01:18:59 2015 UTC,"wish you good luck, because that is what you need now :)"
CompanyOfHeroes,35dyaf,TheMoogster,1 point,Mon May 11 11:25:28 2015 UTC,So Relic is okay with this?
