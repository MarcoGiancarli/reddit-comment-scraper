Employers, more often than not, have all the bargaining power.  If you're not happy with your job, they'll have 3 people lined up to interview before you even get home.  Meanwhile, you've got bills due and no source of income, and need to go through interview after interview of ""Why did you leave your most recent employer?""

The person you're interviewing with isn't interested in someone that's going to ""rock the boat.""

I want you to celebrate, and even enjoy this nervousness, because it will keep things exciting for a long time.    Now, I'd like to give a word of caution, sorry - I'm a lot older, and things have happened.  Here's something to watch for, well two things really.    One,  eventually it will all come to seem normal, and someday you'll find yourself wanting to swear at one of those 'mom-age' ladies who report to you.  Don't.  Don't ever let authority eat your heart.  It's even more important than usual because you are young.  Stay human, keep it in mind all the time.  Two:  The more money and the power will have an energy of their own,  and some people find that in those circumstances, a quality they didn't know they had will come out:  self-destructiveness.  I call it ""snatching defeat out of the jaws of victory"", a backwards take on an old saying.  Drugs, alcohol, spending, associations with people who are not okay,  strange preferences...I mean, you can have some of all that,  but please, keep in mind that proportion and self-control are vital to everyone who carries power and responsibility.

self,3e015y,Haduken2g,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:28:40 2015 UTC,"And I'm shaking right now. Because I still feel like I'm somehow faking it.   One of the biggest life lessons I learned to get me past the impostor syndrome stuff:  A professional ins't necessarily good at their job, they are only paid to do it.  Somehow being professional caries a connotation that you are an expert.    This isn't the ""fake it till you make it"" pep talk. this is just how life works, you are inexperienced. You have to prove that you can fulfill this role, just take notes.  Organization is the only tool most professionals really have anyway.  (EDIT: organization prevents stress, increases focus, allows you to spend time on tasks that you didn't expect, which are stressful, giving you time to fix them)  Not sure if they plan on bringing you in on the day the store opens, but ask if you can come in to take tour of the facilities, bring a notebook, write down where stuff is, where locks are, where the keys are, how much inventory goes into displays, where do you lock them up at night... Just look at everything and ask yourself at least 2 questions for each thing you can think of ... even silly things... this will lead you to asking really important questions.  Just line up your duties, write stuff down.  figure out what has to get done, and when you make a mistake, you add it to your list, eventually it becomes routine.  When it comes to managing people always remember that you have to cater to people who feel just like you do for jobs that are much much easier, and they will be shy timid and sometimes make very very dumb mistakes.  (Most of the time because they are worried they might make a mistake) It might help to give them a list of duties, at which point you'll laugh at yourself because you remember getting one of those @16 working your first job, thinking ""oh this is silly"" shit's come full circle real fast.

It was just weird, hearing the only person that supported me the most telling me I am a loser and that none of my dreams would come true.

Its not normal to cut ties with one's family unless they've done something really outrageous. ""Not saving enough money"" is not a good reason in my humble opinion.   Telling me I am a loser and that none of my dreams would come true.

self,3e2xwb,perusen,3,Tue Jul 21 15:34:54 2015 UTC,"i love the layout. not sure how the content is supposed to be organized. i arrived, and saw articles about three very random things....is it like a hot articles viewer?"
self,3e2xwb,lukekarasa,3,Tue Jul 21 15:42:04 2015 UTC,"Hey!  (I'm his wife, so I can answer some of your questions).    Since we don't have a lot of content right now, it may not be clear how the content is organized - let me clear up:   Topics - Users open a topic, and then write a post, and other users can also write under that same topic.  This is similar to here, Reddit, but! the main difference is that there are no direct comments to each other (I can't write under that user's post and say ""hey, this is awesome"") - rather, each user is supposed to write their own unique flushed-out entry, or description of that particular topic.   Voting - Users vote on the content that they like, which enables the sorting of the topics and posts within the topics for various parameters, like ""Hot"" ""Not"" ""Controversial"" etc. Categories - Each topic is tagged under different categories, like ""Nature"" or ""Art"" ""Science"" and such, which you will be able to sort through to get content specific to that category (similar to subreddits) Front Page - There is the front page, which you see as having random topics or ""hot articles"" as you said.  You can sort the front page to see the ""New"" ""Rising"" ""Controversial"" or ""Random"" topics of the day.   Other Sorting - You can also sort through the topics listed on the left frame by various parameters, changing the category, time range, and whether it's hot, new, random, etc..  This way, you can view through many topics. Internal Links - As you can see from the posts, users are able to internally reference other topics in the site.  For example, if I'm talking about Stephen Colbert and I mention the Colbert Report in the post, I would create an internal link to the Colbert Report.  Now, since we are new, that link would probably be a dead link since we have not yet made a post for the Colbert Report.  But, the idea is that each post cross-references others in the website, just like an encyclopedia.   Basically, we are trying to make a platform where there is organized social knowledge.  It functions as an encyclopedia in that it is detailed, cross-referenced, searchable information, but is also a social encyclopedia, in that it incorporates not just facts, but opinions, experiences, etc. and allows people to follow the categories, topics and users that they enjoy most.  We would like for users to be able to easily search for, categorize, and sort through the content, as they browse or contribute topics.   I hope this cleared it up for you, and let us know if you have any other comments.  Thanks for checking us out!"
self,3e2xwb,bagheera1471,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:36 2015 UTC,"I also want to add that we want this website to be a place where you can go back and read what people wrote about a particular topic, event, movie etc. I think this is where we are going to offer something different than reddit.

You should really consider seeing a doctor to get some help tapering off if you're on 75cl a day though; alcohol withdrawal syndrome can lead to seizures, brain damage, and even death in the very worst cases. There are a few pills that can seriously reduce risk of something bad happening that your doctor might be able to point you towards."

self,3e0j5w,throwaway-itis,5,Tue Jul 21 00:49:04 2015 UTC,"As a person who has, and will likely always, feel that urge to ""run away,"" I can offer a few thoughts. All of those ideas sound really lovely and idyllic and just aesthetically pleasing.  Just a reality check: by pursuing those options, you will likely always be poor. This means you will not have the opportunity to have a nice home or have the things that make life comfortable. Manual labor is difficult and is a rough path when you stop being young or if you become injured. You will not be getting intellectually challenged the way you are now, and which is apparently important enough for you to have begun a graduate program in the first place. You will lack the stability of a white collar job, which allows you to save for retirement, have paid vacations, regular hours, and quality health insurance.  Which is not to say you wouldn't be happy. But it's very easy to lose perspective and want to escape from the structures that are making your feel trapped without fully considering how that life would actually suit you ten years down the line.   Just my two cents.  EDIT: what your family and friends think comes from a place of love but should not be the thing to hold you back."
self,3e0j5w,kittens_and_rainbows,2,Tue Jul 21 13:53:13 2015 UTC,"But how that life suits me in 10 years may not be relevant. Maybe I'll want to settle down then instead of now. Who knows? Why do I need to spend my retirement years when I'm older? To me, it makes much more sense to get out and explore while you're younger and still have the desire/energy to do so.  Complacency in the ""structures that are making me feel trapped"" is my biggest fear. So what if I have a meager living in a dump apartment anywhere I go if I'm happy. Maybe I won't be happy, but my gut says otherwise.  And despite being in grad school, I don't particularly enjoy intellectual challenge. That's why I want to seek simpler, less stressful work."

That's why I sometimes envy those who are truly weird/different that do things almost no one else does.  The goal would be to fulfill the thesis, and adventure after that.  Well, maybe.  It could be just as important to work a few years, save, then use that money as a way to hold all of these jobs.  If it's an unpopular field, it's likely that a few years of non-related experience won't cause any big hit.  You're intelligent, and that will show in everything you've done to get that degree.  Family members that have a concrete idea of your future will always complain if you move off the path.  As long as you can support your own lifestyle it's all up in the air."

Anyone who has access to your email can access any account that uses a confirmation email for the forgotten-password process (which is just about everything).

But, there's only one thing we can do that has any real hope of mitigating the damage, and that is to exercise our empathy.  When an ex posts revenge porn, he is enlisting the rest of the world as his personal army to withhold kindness from their target.  It is up to those of us who receive the picture to not make the target a focus of shame.  I admit that's easier said than done.  There's always going to be dumbasses who receive the picture and use it against them in our absence. When you see a naked picture of a friend, remember who sent it to you.  Even if they're not the origin, but just another vector, then you know that they share the origin's disrespect.  Remember that they've shown their true face, and now you know who not to trust."
self,3dvl53,Silverlight42,12,Mon Jul 20 02:26:11 2015 UTC,It seems fishy/odd that your ex's best friend would randomly happenstance across nudes of you.  I would be suspicious of this.

self,3dvl53,lordsmish,50,Mon Jul 20 02:02:38 2015 UTC,"Hi OP, I just browsed through your post history, and it looks like you have quite a bit on your plate at the moment.  I just want to say that nudes in the grand scheme of things are completely harmless. The only harm they can cause is within your own head. Nobody else really cares. Your future job opportunities don't care. Your future boyfriend doesn't care. Your future friends don't care. Nobody could possibly gain any negative light towards you as a result of these nudes besides yourself.  The saddest stories in the world are when young women like yourself let small things like this get to their head in drastic ways. Stay strong OP. Even if people recognize you, it wouldn't matter. In a few years, nobody is going to recognize you anyway. It also sounds like the photos were posted online anonymously. They're not doing the rounds at your former high-school, city-forum, church-group, etc... but even if they were, people stop caring pretty quickly.  If you're really curious as to the consequences of online nudes, feel free to ask the ladies on /r/gonewild. 99.999% of them can probably attest that their life is still going along just fine, even with the nudes. That said, I'm not condoning posting nudes on /r/gonewild. I couldn't do it myself. I'm merely saying that it's not the end of the world!  In regards to your ex, I think a sub like /r/penpals might better understand where your coming from more so than this sub or the typical /r/relationship_advice type sub-reddits. My two cents though: It's hard to find love without physically meeting someone. I don't think you got anywhere close given his actions.  Welcome to reddit. I hope you stick around. I've been coming to this site for almost a decade now, and it's been a pretty great community to grow up with."

self,3dvl53,breezytrees,47,Mon Jul 20 11:17:01 2015 UTC,"I have to politely disagree. Hand-waiving issues like this like it's no big deal isn't seeing the world from OP's point of view. It's beyond the nudes spreading online but also breach of trust. It's devastating for someone to hurt you and have no idea why.   It's not even the same as the girls from /r/gonewild because they willingly shared those photos with strangers. And depending on your school or job, things like these can definitely impact your life. And that's only scratching the surface, without considering the psychological/emotional toll this puts on OP.   Remember that posts like these aren't about asking you for a solution or to berate OP with what she could've done. Sometimes it's as simple as reading and learning to empathize with their situation -- which seems to be missing from a lot of these comments."
self,3dvl53,Dizzy-Cat,8,Mon Jul 20 08:20:38 2015 UTC,"Of course. I only offered solace on a very small part of what's troubling her, but I hope I gave some useful advice with where to turn next, should OP want to continue down this path."
self,3dvl53,breezytrees,2,Mon Jul 20 12:58:19 2015 UTC,Thanks. Honestly my nudes being online isn't what bothers me. What bothers me is that I trusted this guy and he fucked me over.
self,3dvl53,Dizzy-Cat,3,Tue Jul 21 00:21:25 2015 UTC,"Unless you want to become a teacher, a professor, a public official, a lawyer...  Nudes absolutely hurt.  When you're 19 and in college, your life will move along just fine.  If you work at the 7-11, the pizza shop or some other kid job, your life will move along just fine.  But if you work in a place where you need a reputation, online nudes will absolutely destroy you.  I'm a school psychologist.  It only requires a master's degree, but my education is only a small part of my job.  It's mostly built on trust and respect.  I wouldn't even date a girl if I knew she online nudes.  It's a shame, of course, but the risk that a kid or parent might bump into it would be too high.  Just dating or being married to someone with nudes or a porn video or something like that would kill my career, if anyone I interacted with came across it.   Of course, I couldn't officially be fired.  But it would kill my reputation, and the school districts would start calling another psychologist in my place.  Slowly but surely, all my work would dry up.  And why not?  Why should the schools need to deal with contoversy?  I think this is really important, because you breezytrees, are trying to make it seem like this poor girl's nudes are meaningless.  That might be the case, and then again, it could destroy her career path.  The lesson isn't to deal with nudes.  It's to never take them in the first place.  Getting 30 seconds of horny attention isn't worth your potential furture.  Just don't do it."
self,3dvl53,Silverlight42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:51:35 2015 UTC,"I think your wisdom is wise for a young girl who is about to post nudes online, but not apropros for a young girl who is victim of this invasion of privacy.  In all likely-hood, given OP's specific circumstance, her nudes will most likely never be a problem, even if she became a lawyer. I think to infer that ""online nudes will absolutely destroy you"" (if you need a reputation), is not only miss-leading, but possibly damaging to the dreams and aspirations of someone victim of such an act."
self,3dvl53,arbivark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:17:31 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to personally attack her, rather use her situation as a hard lesson.  I feel bad for the girl, I really do.  But, people, especially young people, just keep doing this.  Don't send nudes; even to your husband or wife.  Your attempt to soothe the girl was worthwhile and just.  However, I think you made a mistake.  Rather than soothe this individual, I think you sugar-coated the entire problem with public nude photos.  Furthermore defering to the judgement of /gonewild is akin to getting diet advice from a sufferer of bulimia nervosa.  While some of the people are healthy and well adjusted, it's plain as day that many on /gonewild are suffering from mental health issues regarding body image.   Nonetheless you're right, I should have said ""can"" instead of ""will."""

There's millions of nude photo's posted to the internet every week. It's literally like winning the lottery unless you're deliberately looking for it. Hence the ""my best friend found it"".  Did you ever get definitive proof this guy was who he said it was? Did you ever get any defining information you could use to find out who he was in real life?  There's definitely a lie somewhere, here's my top 3 guesses   Your ex was pretending to be this guy you never met to get nudes from you/manipulate you into getting back together. Someone else who vaguely knows you was catfishing you (possibly your ex's BFF if thats the true part). Your ex was deliberately looking for nudes of you and made up that his friend found them to make it seem like he wasn't still pining for your glory hole.   It's probably 3 since that's the most boring answer but you should definitely dig into this more. Something is afoot."

Many will continue to drive recklessly having seen a friend crash and burn, but still be certain that they are invincible.  particularly young people. Many will drive recklessly their whole lives and never get so much as a fender bender. Many make careers of reckless/dangerous driving while others tell their friends how dangerous they drive so to impress their friends even though they actually drive like grandmothers. None of these make good role models  for the average person. Emulating them can very easily lead to disaster. It is up to adults to counsel against such dangerous behavior."

Not because it's unethical - I see nothing wrong with that, in fact - but because it's difficult/DANGEROUS for you. You never know who is hiding behind the screen. They can write whatever they want but hey, you'll never know who they really are. You can fake a life very well on the Internet, so he probably just kinda wanted to get there.

And none of those does need physical closeness. Especially not since in our time and age we got internet and other telecomunication means. Aren't there records of pen pals falling in love?

But in the end doubt crept back into his life, and he had nothing left to combat his feeling of worthlessness. He wished that he had real friends in the real world to share his conquest to, but he doesnt. With nowhere else to turn in life he decided to flaunt his triumph on the free web in order to get real validation back from the world. Perhaps he felt like he was paying a debt, how many other anons have posted private pictures for him to masturbate to, alone? All those unsung heroes. But perhaps the feeling wasn't what he expected. Instead of an ego boost he felt that he had sold his soul to the devil. All of his insecurities that had just been in his head before now had been manifested- he no longer could deny that he was a piece of shit that didn't deserve a girl's love, because he literally betrayed the trust of the only person that ever gave a shit. He read the comments from strangers talking about all the dirty shit they would do to you and he hated them for it, because they didn't know how sweet you were. They weren't the ones who won over your heart and yet they already expected so much from you. They wanted more... and what if you gave him more? How could he trust himself with more photos? Where would he draw the line? He just isn't himself when he's horny and alone. I don't know how a man could ever bring himself to talk to you with so much guilt on his conscience. Send him one final message that just says, ""I posted your dick pic to the web and it got a few laughs."" and then just block him."

The classes were comically easy. 2 years later, I got a job as a Tech and don't regret one day of it. The one lesson I've learned while being here is that it doesn't matter what you do in school. Most of it will be irrelevant in the work force. Go get a cert or something to show that youi know what you're doing in the field that you choose and go find as much work related to that field as you can.

self,3dzy3m,bannana,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:39:20 2015 UTC,"You are completely oversimplifying a very complex situation.   Long Long ago, it wasn't even the Palestinians and Israeli people who were fighting, it was just the Christians and the Muslims. They didn't care who had it as long as that land was held by their religion.   This goes on for a while but after all of it, the Muslims hold control of the region and the fighting over it stops.   Wars happen ( not over the region just all over the world ) and then WWI happens. This is where the antisemitism starts. Both Russia and Germany ( as well as Britain and France and partially the U.S. ) all voiced suspicion of the Jews, Russia ended up adopting a policy of deportation. This is why you had an influx of Jewish people in western Europe.   Palestine during WWI was part of the Ottoman Empire, and later on was made its own country.   So that never really goes away, and the war ends and we see how badly Germany was treated afterword. Hitler rises up, as does antisemitism, and WWII happens. We all know the holocaust happens, and I think we can agree that was all pretty crappy.   So after all of that, after millions of Jews were killed for being Jewish, the Allied forces decide to give them ( the Jews ) a place of their own. They were run out of their land before ( something that has been documented well in history, this isn't a made up fact from a religious book ) and while it wasn't the best thought out of plans, they that well known plot of land to the country now known as Israel.  So May 14 1948 comes around and Israel has its land, and almost immediately ( as in the very next day )  all the surrounding countries declare war, march in and a deadly 9 month war takes place, leading to a cease fire and an armistice agreement. Israel holds a large majority of the original territory given to them, but Jordan occupies and later annexes the West Bank, Egypt takes over the Gaza Strip, and the All Palestine government was declared by the Arab League on September 22, 1948.   I hope you are still reading, because if you are going to make claims like this than you need to know your history.   After this, you have constant cross border attacks by militants supported by Jordan and Egypt. Israel retaliates and at one point takes over the Gaza Strip but the withdrew their forces.  Here is something you need to realize, Palestine was never actually given their freedom from any country. They were set up as a government so Egypt and Jordan could do what they wanted. When that wasn't going so well they dissolved the All-Palestine Government and merged it into the United Arab Republic ( something that the Palestinian national movement did not want ).   Some things happen but most importantly the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) is formed by Yasser Arafat and is granted a seat in the Arab League.   In 1967 the Six Day War happens. Egypt mobilizes their forces along the Israeli border in the Sinai Peninsula, and Israel launched preemptive strikes against the Egyptian airfields effectively taking Egypt out of the fight ( they didn't have a great defensive infrastructure to begin with and they didn't expect that to happen, so Israel was able to push back the forces all the way across the Sinai Peninsula ).   Gamal Abdel Nasser gets Syria and Jordan to attack Israel ( using the confusion to make them think that Egypt defeated the air strike ) but Israel retaliated and encircled East Jerusalem. They ( the Israelis ) take Jerusalem, the West bank, and Bethlehem from Jordan, then turn to Syria and cripple their air force and push them back.   June 11 a ceasefire is signed and the war ends. The interesting thing is, it was all set in motion because the Soviet Union was giving Egypt false reports that they were massing their military against the Syrian Border. Once again outside forces lead to bloodshed in the region.  the PLO for many years to come attacks from Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, causing a lot of conflict in the region. It is a game of "" Stop poking me "" except people are dying and the countries are turning a blind eye while Israel is just trying to protect themselves.   In  1982 Israel and Egypt sign a peace treaty which leads to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, which led to the Oslo Accords of 1993. This allows the PLO to take ground in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and a bit of self governing.   This are starting to look good, but the radical Islamic elements in Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad are not happy, and neither are the Israeli radicals who think that giving up land is a sign of weakness. This leads to an Israeli fanatic assassinating Israeli Prime Minister Rabin. More conflict happens after round and round of unsuccessful negotiations.   ISRAEL removed every soldier and Jewish settler from Gaza. They allowed Palestine to take over that region. Hamas takes over and Israel says okay but you have to agree to prior Israeli-Palestinian agreements forswearing violence and recognize Israels right to exist. It was a simple request, to which Hamas responded with Rocket attacks.   That is why Israel does what it does. They have been repeatedly bulled and they do not have the bigger gun, they are proactive about their security, and they have tried to make peace, the extremists on both sides don't allow that to happen.   A better example would be if an extremist Athiest faction and the Westburo Baptist Church caused so much conflict through other people against each other that military action had to be enforced otherwise more bloodshed would happen."

self,3dw2b7,BurningCharcoal,2,Mon Jul 20 07:05:43 2015 UTC,"Ow. That's disgusting. 4 months. Close your eyes, knock yourself out and hope you forget about it. That four month part hit me. x_x"

self,3dy64j,TheAkashicRecord,4,Mon Jul 20 14:26:14 2015 UTC,"There is actually a huge misunderstanding about what is going on with Cuba and the US.  Currently, Cuba is NOT open to US citizens for simple tourism. While the Department of State removed them from the State Sponsors of Terrorism Embargo, they are STILL embargoed by both the Department of Commerce and Office of Foreign Asset Controls.  Basically, by removing one of the three embargoes, the US allowed it's citizens to visit Cuba on 12 'open licenses' - that is to say, reasons you can go to Cuba without applying for a license to do so.  None of those 12 reasons are ""tourism"" however, some are worded vaguely enough that you can try and scam it.  The open licenses, if your curious, are:  family visits; official business of the U.S. government, foreign governments, and certain intergovernmental organizations; journalistic activity; professional research and professional meetings; educational activities; religious activities; public performances, clinics, workshops, athletic and other competitions, and exhibitions; support for the Cuban people; humanitarian projects; activities of private foundations or research or educational institutes; exportation, importation, or transmission of information or information materials; and certain authorized export transactions."

self,3dy64j,mepi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"so in the worst case scenario you'll get a slap on the wrist, harder if Rubio is elected.  Not so hard (if at all) under Obama.  Fly to Cancun and get on a Cuban plane.  Find out from Lonely Planet's Thron Tree what's the latest is on getting your passport stamped.  Ideally you don't want two Mexico entry stamps right next to each other.  And avoid LAX.    to answer your question, yes, you should go before a lot more real estate development occurs."
self,3dy64j,uglysexyfeet,0,Mon Jul 20 16:53:49 2015 UTC,I'm Canadian and can travel freely to Cuba. I was just pondering if an influx of american property money would ruin Cuba's uniqueness.
self,3dy64j,uglysexyfeet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:34:14 2015 UTC,"my bad.  is American property money so much worse than France's?  Having traveled to Cuba, 6 visits over 3 months, I doubt a Cuban would tell you so.  But if your sensibilities are particularly offended by sight of US enterprises, I'd say you still have a couple of years.  If the republicans are elected to the executive, more time.    Havana desperately needs RE development.  Building fall down all the time.  It's just dangerous.  But I'm not sure where the government will steer the money. You can probably find out from their news sources and the guys on LP who've married a Cuban and are now trying to figure how they can exploit that advantage.    But given your interest in seeing the differential rate of growth, I book to the West, places like Viñales and then to Santiago de Cuba.  And yes, I go ASAP."
self,3dws9k,speakin_theWord,2,Mon Jul 20 04:33:37 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like y'all never had a meaningful relationship and she just used you for sex. Sorry bro. But if I were you, I'd be counting my praises you didn't waste more time on this girl. I'd also be signing up to get tested for any STI's, as if she's banging other dudes whatever those dudes have could be yours now.   Good luck. Shit's hard, but you got lucky when you dodged this bullet. Learn to wise up sooner if you have to go through this another time."
self,3dws9k,alosec_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:15:36 2015 UTC,"We never had sex. I want to wait until I'm married and when I told her that thats what I wanted to do, she said she loved the idea and that she has 100% down with it.   And as far as not wasting time on her, I wasted a good chunk of the last six years being hung up on her."
self,3dws9k,d8f7de479b1fae3d85d3,2,Mon Jul 20 15:20:54 2015 UTC,"She told me I felt like home. She told me she loved me.   For the love of Jibbers, that hit me in the feelers. Look, some people are just not monogamous. Some part of it is just being young, but it will always be a thing for some people. If it bothers you, you have to move on and find someone that shares your attitude towards relationships.   Good luck bro."

self,3dwp7t,boxmansreaper,3,Mon Jul 20 04:03:18 2015 UTC,"small changes lead to big changes.  I'm an old guy - here's my advice. Go join a league , like intramural volleyball. Find something to join that you need to be a part of. It sounds like you'ev got friends, but want something of your own. Do something , get out there. Find a group to join   Superprofundo on the early eve of your day!"
