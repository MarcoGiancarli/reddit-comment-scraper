Harley,3e3cfy,Nelson1107,9,Tue Jul 21 17:16:21 2015 UTC,It's the same philosophy for cruisers and sport bikes or any motorcycle. So just squint your eyes and imagine they're on Harley's.
Harley,3e3cfy,Kvorter,2,Tue Jul 21 17:17:58 2015 UTC,"lol, positioning on the bike is so different though, rear sets v.s forward controls."
Harley,3e3cfy,SuicideKlutch,9,Tue Jul 21 17:29:31 2015 UTC,"But the physics and geometry remain pretty much the same. Your seating position doesn't change how your bike turns or brakes, it just makes it more comfortable (cruiser) or responsive (supersport). Countersteer, lean, brake pressure (front vs rear), all of it applies to all motorcycles. This video is dated and corny but provides some really good information for any rider."
Harley,3e3cfy,shakexandxbake,3,Tue Jul 21 18:22:33 2015 UTC,Having ridden both breeds of bikes. I will say it is all the same. The real difference is how your back and nuts feel when you get off of the bikes. Lol.

I thought for sure I'd want to put forward controls on it, but after doing a couple 400-500 mile days, and now riding with forward highway bars, I don't.   I don't like the feeling of my feet thrown out there. To me, it feels like it takes some control away. I've done fine on my rides with mid controls. Stretching my legs out after a couple hours of riding on the highway. I might try forward mids, or sit on someone's bike that has them, but I don't think I'll so forward controls.   Go sit on some bikes. It takes time and riding to learn how comfortable you'll be in the long run."

Harley,3e01ha,BigTexasFart,10,Mon Jul 20 22:27:47 2015 UTC,"So the narrative coming together runs something like this: Cossacks MC is getting bigger, wants to wear ""Texas"" bottom rockers, doesn't want to pay money to the Bandidos MC, or indirectly to the Bandidos through the Confederation of Clubs.  There is violence between members of the two clubs, including two or three fights with weapons that make it into the news.  A club house might have been set on fire, too.  Cossacks MC begin to aggressively court new members, at least one cop (the guy in this blog post) patches in as a Cossack at this time.   The confrontation comes to a head when the Confederation of Clubs, which is run by the Bandidos, holds a meeting in Waco, which is where the Cossacks have a strong presence and the Bandidos have a week one.  The Cossacks show up in force, bringing along the Scimitars MC, which is often portrayed as a support club of the Cossacks.  The Bandidos have not that many patched members at the meeting but do have some, and a significant number of Bandidos support clubs are present.  And after this is where the stories get muddied.  This undercover cop is being blamed on certain websites for instigating violence, but no one has posted evidence of that, and no one (as far as I know) has even claimed to have seen him or heard him specifically do so.  On the other hand, undercover cops do step across moral lines all the time.  The Bandidos have claimed to have been attacked, the Cossacks have claimed to have been only acting in self defense, and so far the police haven't released most of the evidence.  It's not currently clear who even did most of the shooting - club members or cops.  edit for formating"

Harley,3e0drh,Wilgus_Says_What,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:21:30 2015 UTC,"It was so easy. Five minutes, four screws, and a pair of open ended wrenches. I loosened the cable adjusters until I could undo the ball ends from the throttle side grip, slid the new grip on and hooked the ends back in, and then tightened the adjusters back to remove the slack. You want the throttle to have as little play as possible but not so tight it opens up, and I should snap back to idle on it's own."

Harley,3e0drh,silverfox762,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:57:16 2015 UTC,Just be very careful when you remove the ball ends from the throttle grip. There are little brass fittings that hold them in place. Pay attention to how they go in and put them in a shot glass so they don't roll away.
Harley,3e0drh,badasdad,2,Tue Jul 21 05:42:18 2015 UTC,"I have the black diamonds as well. Good grips. The rubber strips are nice to have, they give just enough tack on gloves to ease up on the grip."

Harley,3dylxy,grifter82,2,Mon Jul 20 18:49:02 2015 UTC,"Well originally I was going to go with the Iron 883, because it was cheeper, but after some research I learned it had a smaller engine, and in order to upgrade it to a 1200 would somewhat be a pain, so I didn't. But that wasn't just the reason I think the 48 just look a lot nicer than the 883, although the 72 is nice as well, and I would have got it for the apes that it has on it but, I wanted the fat front tire. All in All, the 48 just had everything that I was looking for, performance, looks, power, and it's black. Solid wins all around. Only downside I'd say is the small ass tank, but I can always upgrade that later if I decide too.  The guy at the HD dealership I got it from said it right.

Harley,3e0uqn,zilla13,3,Tue Jul 21 02:22:41 2015 UTC,"Good lookin' Shovel.  If the transmission oil has been getting lower and lower, this won't really cause what you're talking about, but what will cause this is badly worn shifting forks or bent shifting forks. How many miles are on the transmission? When you found false neutrals, did you accidentally slam the bike back into gear? This can bend shifting forks.   If you've inspected all the shifting linkage outside the tranny, and nothing is worn or bent so badly that it impedes the mechanism, it's gonna be inside the transmission.  When was the last time you checked the transmission oil?  How many miles are on the transmission?  Are the all the parts of the shifting linkage working properly and secured properly?"
Harley,3e0uqn,silverfox762,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:51:51 2015 UTC,Checked the transmission oil two nights ago looked good with a flashlight through the fill hole. I added a couple of ounces to it. No idea how many miles on the trans I bought the bike two years ago without much information. Yes all of the linkage parts are working properly and are secured.
Harley,3e0uqn,silverfox762,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:35:30 2015 UTC,"That transmission probably has bent or worn shifting forks, but also might have worn out thrust washers or broken gears in the tranny too. Probably shifting forks. They wear out. They bend with hard shifting.  Even if it's just shifting forks, this means make surgery. The inner and outer primary covers need to come off. Clutch and motor sprocket need to come off. Starter motor needs to come off. Clutch actuator cover on the right side of the bike needs to come off. AND the battery box and oil tank too.  The good news is you don't need to pull the transmission case out of the bike unless you find the tranny bearings are shot too.  If you've never rebuilt a transmission, it's time consuming, but not super complicated. You'll need a few special tools, like the shifting fork timing tool and a good torque wrench.  If you don't have the ability to do it yourself, it might actually be cheaper to replace the transmission with a rebuilt one."

Harley,3dzxv5,mgweir,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:22:06 2015 UTC,I just had this happen to my RK. The compensator nut came loose and striped the splines on the rotor causing it to not spin around the stator and not charge the battery. Luckily the crank was OK and I just had them replace the rotor (and the stator to be safe).
Harley,3dzxv5,the_scrbble,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:56:47 2015 UTC,Hope the term is correct in English... Check the lambda probe. Had this issue a while ago. Dirt got into the probe and messed up with the sensors. Simple cleaning was the solution.
Harley,3dyfsy,khungkhinh,3,Mon Jul 20 15:39:31 2015 UTC,"This is essentially a bobber build.  I'm a fan of the style too.  Here's what I can immediately tell has been done to the bike besides the shifter. Risers and ape hangers. Air cleaner. Pipes. Fatter front tire/rim. Removed front fender. Different rear fender. Side mount tail light. Seat. Removed turn signals. Removed/relocated switches. Tank (and spine drilled to mount) Coil relocation. Grips/throttle housing. Chain conversion.  There's probably more. However, the frame looks stock, so other than the shifter, chain conversion, wheels and tank mounts this is all work you can do yourself with the right, basic tools and negligible experience. Obviously you have to find and buy the parts. Stuff like the air cleaner and turn signals are very easy. Switch housings require a very basic understanding of the wiring. Bars and risers are easy.  This is probably a '95-'03 sportster. You'd have a billion parts to choose from. And plenty of tanks that require no drilling and welding bungs (however most rounded alien tanks like his will need the frame drilled).  Plenty of places will do the jockey shift, I don't know much about it, but I don't believe you have to go into the transmission.  You're not necessarily over your head, however 50% of the cost of this would be in labor.  If it's not frame or engine related, try to do the work yourself.  Do one thing at a time. If you do too much at once and then something unknown goes wrong, you could get overwhelmed."
Harley,3dyfsy,stevenfrijoles,3,Mon Jul 20 16:23:35 2015 UTC,"Looks like ""Bobber"" style to me.  There's a site I found that's all about Bobber style sportsters....check it out.  http://www.sporty-bobbers.com/"
Harley,3dyfsy,Jpud73,2,Mon Jul 20 16:23:50 2015 UTC,"Actually, just look at the rest of that YouTube channel :) That's a specific shop in Japan. If you frequent xlforum and hdforums (or even chopcult), search for ""crazyorange"" or ""bratstyle"" and you'll find plenty of threads. Almost all of those bikes use a stock-ish frame, due to regulations in Japan.  Lots of threads about jockey shifts, too."
Harley,3e035p,Oderdigg,2,Mon Jul 20 22:40:49 2015 UTC,"I thought they were done doing it.  I did it last year.  You'll have a blast.  Trust me, that thing will out accelerate your bike.  It's pretty wicked in that regard.  Things I liked and disliked: Liked:  fast, smooth, no gas, looked hella cool Disliked:  no sound (not counting electric 'whirring' electric noise, riding position (personal preference), lack of range, did I mention no sound?"
Harley,3e035p,alwaysnope,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:02:38 2015 UTC,"They likely started in the US and are only now making their way up to Canada. Riding position is wrong for my style so I know I won't like that part but I am looking forward to the feel of the power and the tech around it.  Lacking a loud sound can be both good and bad. Good is that you don't disturb the surrounding area. Neighbours don't appreciate a loud bike too late or too early. Bad is that cars may merge into your lane cause they can't hear you enough. That's happened before I got the Harley, I can see that happening again.  What's the range? Did they give out any information?"
Harley,3e035p,alwaysnope,2,Mon Jul 20 23:27:53 2015 UTC,"I'm a techie and I thought it was pretty slick.  Trust me when I say there is nothing good about how quiet the bike is.  You'll see what I mean.  As for my neighbors, I try to be as quiet as I can when I leave for work early in the morning.  There are 2 settings on the bike - power and range, I believe.  I think the power setting will get you like 25 miles and the range setting will get you 45-50 miles.  Something like that.  They will give you more information than you can handle if you ask, everything except the price.  Aside from the riding position, I thought it was a blast to ride.  The batteries are at the bottom, which creates a low center of gravity which makes the bike feel very stable.  Have fun!"

Harley,3dyr4x,JDSportster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:34:00 2015 UTC,I'm curious. What do you hope to accomplish by upgrading the ignition? Are you having ignition problems?
Harley,3dyr4x,silverfox762,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:06:28 2015 UTC,"Tunability, in relation to performance mostly.  Ultimately I am upgrading my bike for performance, and going through most lists of performance upgrades (stages, to some), this is usually on the list and specifically before increasing bore/stroke.  Of the things that have been done to the bike so far I can't imagine this would be the most expensive upgrade anyway."
Harley,3dyr4x,silverfox762,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:16:42 2015 UTC,"You'll see a lot of talk about ""tuners"", which are fuel managers with ECM remapping for EFI bikes. These allow you to tune EFI and attendant ignition function.   Performance ignition modules can work on carbureted and fuel injected motors, and handle ignition timing curves and can improve throttle response and smooth out your power curve. The stock ignition it's tuned for EPA fuel economy and pollution standards, but otherwise it works ok. An aftermarket ignition module will improve how the bike performs. But absent stuff like performance cams, performance heads or proper head work, higher compression pistons and a performance carb, the gains you get are likely to be small. If you're gonna do those other things, an ignition modules is essential on a carbureted bike to get the most out of your motor."
Harley,3dyr4x,longhairedcountryboy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:04:10 2015 UTC,Why?  You already have electronic ignition.  You should tune the carb and set the timing for yourself.  Unless you have a problem I don't see any reason to change the ignition.  If you do have a problem Crane Hi-4 or Daytona or whatever else is not better than stock in my opinion.

I think people were probably more comfortable shelling out the dough for something like that back then considering it was expected to give service for a long time and be repairable, whereas I wouldn't count on an $800 LCD digital way cool speedo today to last more than a decade on average and I doubt you could locate parts / have it repaired easily."

Harley,3dw2xa,AJ56,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:39:12 2015 UTC,"First post with pics and I wrote up a bit of a script about the run but it isn't here.  So 1100k round trip to Blinman in the Flinders Ranges SA.  15 bikes some from Melbourne Vic and Mt Gambier in lower south east.  Cold, Wet, Cold and wet.  But great trip, shit weather on Sat but nice day on Sunday but still cold.  Stayed over night at Quorn at the Transcontinental Hotel, then headed home yesterday.  Bit of an annual run hence the name."
Harley,3dw2xa,gin_wrangler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:44:43 2015 UTC,good pics mate.
Harley,3dv7fm,JLamont51,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:09:09 2015 UTC,So a fanny pack makes a man or a bike look horrible. Noted
Harley,3dv7fm,Polar_Bear1488,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:34:00 2015 UTC,Agreed. But it's all I have to put my hat in.
Harley,3dv7fm,GrewUpaScrewUp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:18:34 2015 UTC,"I have recently been looking into getting a dyna, and I've read great things about this bike. Right now I'm on a sportster but it just doesn't have as much power as I would like it to have, have you rode with a passenger on this bike yet? I'm just curious, is like to take my wife on rides with me and the sporty isn't cutting it."
Harley,3dv7fm,nycsportster,2,Sun Jul 19 21:00:53 2015 UTC,Two up on my street bob semi often. More then enough power for the occasional ride. If it was all the time I'd get a bagger.
Harley,3dv7fm,GrewUpaScrewUp,2,Mon Jul 20 00:18:06 2015 UTC,"Absolutely love it so far. I took someone out last weekend for the first time on it, and was pleasantly surprised. Handled like a dream even with the extra weight."

Harley,3dv4lf,Bladerunner54,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:45:02 2015 UTC,That's exactly the sissy bar I want! Where'd you get it?
Harley,3dv4lf,davekingofrock,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:10:19 2015 UTC,It looks like the standard Harley Davidson one-piece quick detach. You'll need the hardware for you bike as well. Go check their website. Just don't buy the pad and you'll have that look.
Harley,3dwdl4,vnd,2,Mon Jul 20 02:15:04 2015 UTC,"damn right, make it yours man."
Harley,3dwdl4,Reachmonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:53:03 2015 UTC,"I'm also finding it really fun to do stuff myself instead of taking it to a shop or the dealer, as well.  It's crazy, but doing these smaller modifications on this bike is making me want to find an older bike that needs work and restore it."
Harley,3dwdl4,Reachmonkey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:59:57 2015 UTC,"1975 shovel here and im doing exactly that. its currently in a shop getting wired up though because i suck at wiring, but man, i hand picked damn near every part on there from swap meets/old biker shops and she is truly mine.  it is a hell of a job but its 100% worth it, as long as you have something to ride in the meantime"
Harley,3dwdl4,Oppenheimerdinger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:05:16 2015 UTC,"This is more of a general question to anyone that wants to answer but hopefully you can answer:  Is it generally safer to try and rebuild older Harleys due to the abundance of people restoring them/parts availability?  I see a whole bunch of older 80s Honda and Yamaha bikes in my area's Craigslist but I worry that if I need a part while rebuilding it would be hard/cost prohibitive to find them.  I'm very technically apt, but don't have any kind of way to manufacture anything."
Harley,3dwdl4,Oppenheimerdinger,2,Mon Jul 20 06:27:09 2015 UTC,Another fellow Voodoo purple Iron owner! I've never seen another posted here. Glad to see I'm not the only one!
Harley,3dwdl4,TheUnRealTylerDurden,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:29:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I really fell in love with the color the first time I saw it.  It's a bonus that people notice it on the road more, too."
Harley,3dwdl4,TheUnRealTylerDurden,2,Mon Jul 20 07:44:33 2015 UTC,That's the exact same reason I picked the purple. It was either Amber Whiskey or Voodoo. Saw the Voodoo in light and my mind was made up. It's such a gorgeous paint.

Harley,3dwhwd,gdlovesugl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:50:18 2015 UTC,exactly what i was going to say. this is some good info right here op.  you truly cant know what it feels like until you sit on it.
Harley,3dwhwd,Reachmonkey,4,Mon Jul 20 05:58:15 2015 UTC,"Fellow 5' 4"" rider here. I can flat foot my 48 wearing boots. But yeah, what everyone else said, go to a dealer and sit on one."
Harley,3dwhwd,Junk_isHxC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:15:24 2015 UTC,5'4 and female is perfect for an 883.

Harley,3dtyzp,PreacherIHMC,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:17:57 2015 UTC,Why do you guys wear those?  Are you junior league Bandits or something?
Harley,3dtyzp,dickbuttpunch,4,Mon Jul 20 23:19:19 2015 UTC,"I don't do well with sarcasm, but the fact that you made an account just to ask me that leads me to believe you're simply trying to start shit. Not going to happen. If anyone wants an actual answer to that, the Bandidos have always been there for us as a club from day one. They've mentored us, helped us, and have never asked us for anything in return. We're not a support club, but we do proudly support the Fat Mexican."
