ElizabethOlsen,3af0yi,neoism,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:09:44 2015 UTC,"They were actually quite pretty. Not as close as Lizzy (In my eyes), but they were going strong. Cocaine had to ruin everything."
ElizabethOlsen,3af0yi,Ridwan232,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:16:29 2015 UTC,Why is lizzy missing? Haven't seen any new pictures of her from paparazzi or otherwise in so long
ElizabethOlsen,3af0yi,Ridwan232,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:16:50 2015 UTC,"Probably from filming Avengers 2 and now Civil War, I would say been pretty busy with that stuff."
ElizabethOlsen,3af0yi,BrandonAUS,2,Tue Jun 23 01:05:27 2015 UTC,"We got some set Photos a while ago, Nothing after that :("
ElizabethOlsen,3af0yi,Ridwan232,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:29:31 2015 UTC,"Yea :( I was the one posting those, and would post more but there have been non since sadly..  Hopefully she has a break from the movie and does some other stuff in between. But she was so amazing in Avengers so, to get her be amazing again as the same character next year will be worth it :)"
ElizabethOlsen,3af0yi,BrandonAUS,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:34:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I scoured the net for them, found them on a few Lizzie Fan pages.  Does she have any official Social media that you know of? Insta, Facebook, Twitter etc?"
ElizabethOlsen,3af0yi,Ridwan232,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:52:02 2015 UTC,"Not that I know of, they are all fan pages that I have seen, I do hope she joins social media soon. She is one of my favourite celebs and the only one who doesn't use social media :("
ElizabethOlsen,3af0yi,BrandonAUS,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:14:11 2015 UTC,She apparently stated that she won't join any Social media ever :(  Sad.
ElizabethOlsen,3af0yi,Ridwan232,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:19:35 2015 UTC,Hopefully she changes her mind eventually.
ElizabethOlsen,3ab6hn,hh7002,2,Thu Jun 18 18:01:09 2015 UTC,God's best creation <3
ElizabethOlsen,38u738,KiraHead,3,Sat Jun 6 21:26:03 2015 UTC,God I can't wait for an hd version of this costume
ElizabethOlsen,38u738,ElDuderino2112,3,Thu Jun 11 00:36:26 2015 UTC,Similar Concept art
ElizabethOlsen,38u738,pornboy0,2,Mon Jun 15 19:21:28 2015 UTC,Literally asked for this a while ago on this subreddit.  I love you! Got anymore?
ElizabethOlsen,38u738,Ridwan232,2,Sun Jun 7 03:27:07 2015 UTC,"Nope. I found one other one, but it's pretty much the same image, just with some text across it."
ElizabethOlsen,38b1x9,SpyKyle,3,Wed Jun 3 01:34:33 2015 UTC,What's funny is that her and the actor who play her twin played a married couple together in Godzilla.
ElizabethOlsen,38b1x9,arista81,4,Wed Jun 3 08:54:38 2015 UTC,What's even funnier is that there's also an interview somewhere in which she talks about how she and Aaron tried to subtly work in the incestuous element of the characters from the Ultimate universe.
ElizabethOlsen,38b1x9,zeroshark,2,Wed Jun 3 16:55:33 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more. Those genes really are something special. I am a huge Marvel fan and knew Avengers 2 would be good but wasn't sure if it would be better than all the other movies. But the twins were just way better than I could have imagined. Cannot wait to see her in Civil War.
ElizabethOlsen,38b1x9,BrandonAUS,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:55:16 2015 UTC,I'm waiting to get a still of her costume at the end of the movie! Her hair!!
ElizabethOlsen,38b1x9,Ridwan232,-1,Wed Jun 3 18:05:01 2015 UTC,I'd like for her father to impregnate my future wife.
ElizabethOlsen,37onfi,BrandonAUS,2,Fri May 29 04:42:04 2015 UTC,I squeal like a girl when I see these.
ElizabethOlsen,37onfi,ItzClobert,2,Fri May 29 20:19:46 2015 UTC,I feel like that's a standard reaction.
ElizabethOlsen,37onfi,DanielsJacket,1 point,Sat May 30 02:15:21 2015 UTC,<3
ElizabethOlsen,37onfi,DanielsJacket,9,Fri May 29 13:15:53 2015 UTC,I will keep posting them as I come across them. She looks so dam good as a superhero.
ElizabethOlsen,37onfi,DanielsJacket,2,Fri May 29 13:18:56 2015 UTC,"So glad she signed a fairly lengthy deal, couldn't agree more."
ElizabethOlsen,34vjhy,Mr_Pee_Pee,3,Mon May 4 22:26:32 2015 UTC,Absolutely flawless.
ElizabethOlsen,33yd6i,SmoopyRocks,8,Sun Apr 26 20:30:08 2015 UTC,Nipples unite!
ElizabethOlsen,33yd6i,work_of_shart,2,Fri May 1 13:23:53 2015 UTC,Nipples Assemble!!
ElizabethOlsen,33yd6i,liveanddiethisday,2,Tue May 5 02:50:04 2015 UTC,Nips....smash!
ElizabethOlsen,33yd6i,omega9nine,1 point,Wed May 6 01:59:07 2015 UTC,She's so perfect that her nipples are constantly hard.
ElizabethOlsen,33yd6i,french_toste,0,Wed May 6 05:56:26 2015 UTC,A bit nippely in there. But I guess she made the breast of it.
ElizabethOlsen,33w0l2,frederic91,1 point,Sun Apr 26 04:07:16 2015 UTC,I don't see Thor's Hammer anywhere in this picture.
ElizabethOlsen,33rbdr,frederic91,2,Fri Apr 24 21:46:55 2015 UTC,good lord... stunning
ElizabethOlsen,33orvl,Mr_Pee_Pee,-2,Fri Apr 24 07:10:43 2015 UTC,You forgot this http://i.imgur.com/mPOFHbD.jpg
ElizabethOlsen,33orvl,HappyGoUnlucky,3,Fri Apr 24 10:12:19 2015 UTC,"Nah, this is Mary-Kate or Ashley Olsen  Edit: It's Ashley"
ElizabethOlsen,33orvl,HappyGoUnlucky,0,Fri Apr 24 10:13:30 2015 UTC,"Well, shit.  I saw the photo as part of this shoot for Liz in here"
