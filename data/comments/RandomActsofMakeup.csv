RandomActsofMakeup,3e2oev,boreals,4,Tue Jul 21 14:22:07 2015 UTC,I've found that formula makes a huge difference with black shadow. With more powdery ones it comes out too sheer and just looks like dirt :( maybe try a black cream shadow or shadow stick?
RandomActsofMakeup,3e2oev,CaptainCatbee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:02:40 2015 UTC,Yes! My black cream shadow with UD Oil Slick dusted over it works well.
RandomActsofMakeup,3e2oev,noddykitty,2,Wed Jul 22 03:57:29 2015 UTC,"Something that has helped me with darker color is to use it in layers, very sparingly. Put a tiny bit on, blendblendblend, then a little more on, blendblendblend, repeat ad nauseam. Working on placement is also important to whatever look you're going for, so play around with it to find what's right for your lids."
RandomActsofMakeup,3e2u60,jaxxly,2,Tue Jul 21 15:07:10 2015 UTC,I would hit up /r/skincareaddiction to figure out underlying reasons why your skin might be oily and how to prevent or ease it on that level. It could also help your acne and help your makeup apply and stay better!
RandomActsofMakeup,3e2u60,StinkybuttMcPoopface,2,Tue Jul 21 15:46:08 2015 UTC,"I have the exact same skin type (oily/acne prone) and tone (pink tones). This may sound counter-intuitive but I've noticed that using a small(!!!) amount of moisturizer before putting on my makeup has helped tremendously with my oily skin. I'm still fairly oily on my forehead and inner cheeks after 8-ish hours, but that is definitely better than my previous ~2 hours.   Now, since you have acne prone skin you may have issues with some of the products I'm going to recommend. Personally, I can't wear Maybelline liquid foundations, any cream foundations, and most moisturizers will break me out.  A couple questions: Is it just your face that has pink undertones or does your entire body have pink undertones? What techniques do you use to apply your liquid foundation? Some products don't like certain techniques. Are you using mostly powder products or mostly liquid/cream products? I noticed that when I started contouring with powder, I minimized quite a bit of oil!  I only have redness/pinkness in my face so I use a color correcting primer. I love how the green Smashbox primer looks and feels, but doesn't combat my oiliness as well as I'd like. Clinique Superprimer (in the yellow tube) is GREAT for oily skin and lasts forever on me, but I wish it covered up the pinkness in my cheeks a bit more.   Foundations? Well, I really shouldn't recommend to you because I have yet to find an HG foundation. The best I've found is the Covergirl 3 in 1 liquid foundation, which is buildable (medium to full) and doesn't oxidize. I really liked the Maybelline 24 hour liquid foundation, but alas it tore my acne-prone skin to pieces. If you go the Maybelline route, be aware that it will oxidize just a bit but I had minimal oil if, and only if, I applied it with a Beauty Blender. Kat Von D Tattoo Lock It Foundation would have been my HG, but it also broke out my skin and it oxidizes something awful around 4 hours.  Concealer? Since you're oily and want full coverage, I would happily recommend Makeup Forever Camouflage Concealer. I've only ever noticed this concealer go oily after working out (which I do at the end of my 10 hour day). I would recommend mixing it with whatever foundation you have because it is FULL COVERAGE.   Powder Foundation? If you aren't using a powder, I would strongly suggest it or at least a setting powder. I use MAC Studio Fix Powder and let me tell you that it is a holy grail product. It gives a bit of coverage, though after primer, liquid foundation and concealer there should be little left to cover. The reason I love this product is because of how well it combats oiliness, it was a total game changer for me. If you pick one product from what I've recommended, I would tell you to pick up this one.  Blush/Contour/Highlighter/etc.? NYX Blush is my go-to for staying power, easily 8+ hours of wear. NYX Taupe was a great, cheap contour color for me (bonus: it will fight away some pinkness), but I prefer Too Faced Chocolate Soleil because I find it's easier to apply and there is a variety of choices (bronzey or just matte? really dark or really subtle? You can have them ALL!). To highlight, I really like Rimmel's Stay Matte in Transparent (hint: not transparent) because it really minimizes the oil on my nose.  Hopefully something in that wall of text will be useful to you. If you have a question on certain products that claim to reduce oil, feel free to ask me because I've likely tried it!"
RandomActsofMakeup,3e2u60,PERNICIOUSPIE,2,Wed Jul 22 00:14:44 2015 UTC,I had a lot of success with smash box products as far as color match and oiliness actually! Do you remember if they broke you out at all?
RandomActsofMakeup,3e2u60,PERNICIOUSPIE,2,Wed Jul 22 04:29:44 2015 UTC,"The Smashbox primers never break me out. I tried a deluxe sample of the Smashbox BB Cream (or CC cream? I can't entirely remember, it was a summer ago) and it did NOT break me out. I've been eyeing the Smashbox Liquid Halo ever since I swatched in Sephora, no noticeable oxidation, very full coverage and it feels like HEAVEN but I haven't tried it full-face yet."
RandomActsofMakeup,3e2u60,Sixkitties,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:07:16 2015 UTC,This might have to be my next purchase. I notice I do much better with a primer and a powder as opposed to a liquid or cream. Thanks for all of your advice!

I love it on top of other, less glittery lipsticks to really make them sparkle or just by itself.  As far as eyeshadow, I'm traveling right now and don't have my entire collection at my fingertips, but of the palettes I brought, I've been using the Balm's Nude 'Tude just about every day that I wear makeup.

It's a real worry, and realistically deters a lot of people from the clinical side of things.

RandomActsofMakeup,3ds5rw,zee_row_gravity,3,Sat Jul 18 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"I don't use Stila's liquid lipsticks, but I do love the KVD ones, OCC lip tars, and the Too Faced Melted ones. For me, the key is hydrated lips.  I have naturally very dry lips, so if I don't take care of them, there is NO liquid lipstick that stays on without flaking! Here are my very limited tips for moisturized lips:   Lip scrub/exfoliant with your nightly routine. I use Lush's lip scrub (in Popcorn, which smells like salted caramel!), but Sugar has a great one, and you can also just use sugar and oil. Moisturize every night with lipbalm or vaseline. Again, I use Lush's ""None of your Beeswax"" lip balm (vegan vanilla lemon is the BOMB) and it's great. Avoid ones like the EOS round lip balms, because those are actually weirdly drying. You want to hydrate. Apply lip balm before your lipstick and let it dry/soak in before primer+color Drink LOTS OF WATER!!!   All of these things should help you have hydrated, moisturized lips, which will be HUGE for helping your liquid lipstick stay flake-free all day.   Edit for formatting."
RandomActsofMakeup,3ds5rw,TheBiggestDragon,2,Sat Jul 18 23:45:59 2015 UTC,"See, I actually like the EOS ones. I have Lush's Honey Trap balm and I feel that it does nothing. I was so disappointed!"
RandomActsofMakeup,3ds5rw,Soruthless,2,Sat Jul 18 23:59:34 2015 UTC,I have the EOS ones as well and I have not really had any issues with it. I think they are more than moisturizing and if I have to find a fault then I would say that they are not good before applying lipstick because they don't dry out enough.
RandomActsofMakeup,3ds5rw,Soruthless,2,Sun Jul 19 00:04:10 2015 UTC,"YES. They're the best when I'm not wearing any lipstick (liquid or otherwise), but you're so right about being under anything. That's why I tend to go with OCC's primer when applying under lipstick."
RandomActsofMakeup,3ds5rw,Soruthless,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:10:14 2015 UTC,"I love the KVD ones and OCC lip tars. I had a similar flaking problem with the Too Faced Melted ones as well. :(  Lol, I guess my problem is not having a regular routine for this. I just tend to forget especially if I am working on a deadline (being in school kinda sucks!). I shouldn't be making excuses though!  My routine is close enough when I do follow it but what I do need to remember is putting on lip balm and letting it dry before putting on primer+lipstick. I always tend to do it at the last minute and it's not dry enough then.  And I follow your last advice to the T. I have had friends and my spouse comment on how much water I tend to drink, lol! So, I know I am well hydrated in that sense. :P"
RandomActsofMakeup,3ds5rw,Soruthless,2,Sun Jul 19 00:00:46 2015 UTC,"I tend to apply Beso similar to this video (Instagram video from Anastasia). I apply it thinly first, let it dry, then I'll go over the patchy or light spots individually. If I overapply, it will break off in small chunks and if I don't apply some sort of lip moisturizer sparingly (Bite's lip mask, OCC's clear primer, etc) before I start my make up, my lips will dry out faster and the flaking can start. Have you tried applying a lip mask before sleeping to prep your lips maybe?"
RandomActsofMakeup,3ds5rw,Soruthless,2,Sat Jul 18 23:19:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I like the idea of letting them dry out after the first application. I will try that the next time. :)   I thought about applying a clear gloss afterwards but it had started flaking by then. And, I don't think I want to spoil the look with a gloss though, I have OCC's clear lip tar but I think it will also change the look of it.  Can you tell me what the difference is between just using a lip balm to moisturize your lips versus using a lip mask? I usually tend to put on a lip balm to moisturize my lips before sleeping."
RandomActsofMakeup,3ds5rw,Soruthless,2,Sat Jul 18 23:31:00 2015 UTC,"I apply Bite's Lip mask before sleeping (I'll brush my teeth, exfoliate my lips then I apply it) and I find that it helps my lips feel nice and soft and ready for make up in the morning. I don't feel like it's the same as when I just use a lip balm, but maybe it's the act of exfoliation and the mask that is making my lips feel more moisturized.   I totally understand not wanting to use the clear primer over the lipstick, because darn it, I want a matte red! But maybe doing an exfoliation and heavy amount of lip balm (or mask) before bed would help. What do you use to exfoliate with?   E: just realized I didn't exactly answer your question! Lol. I like using the lip mask because it's heavier and seeps into the creases of my lips better than any of the lip balms I've ever tried."

She's very straightforward, produces content that's honest and entertaining without some of the yelling and flamboyance of other vloggers.   I love the way that Nikkie Tutorials plays with colors and I think a lot of her looks are really creative and inspired.   My favorite reviewers are probably The Fancy Faced and Total Makeup Junkie 101/Eshani. They're the two vloggers that I've seen give really indepth reviews of a product's formula, and they aren't afraid to say a product disappointed them, despite the hype other vloggers give it.   I also think Sam, Dom, and Angela (Batalash) are all great. Sam in particular has done a great job clarifying when a video is sponsored (for the most part). I also think that Sam for the most part does a really great job explaining the technique behind her makeup application, and why she does things a certain way/uses a certain product/etc."

(youtubers have a habit of only being positive, I respect that she just gives the truth) Her first impressions are over the entire day, giving the wear after several hours. JamBeauty98: She focuses a lot on affordable beauty. She gets a little too excited about products before she has fully tried them out, but tries to be honest. She also has a job outside youtube which I think makes them less focused on making money through utube and more trustworthy.

I'm kind of obsessed with lip products though,  so it's really hard for me to pick! I also just picked up elf matte praline,  and it's climbing the rankings quickly haha!"
RandomActsofMakeup,3dic8p,stapleherdick,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:29:49 2015 UTC,My favorite is a Creme Lipstick from Revlon. #473 Mauvy Night.   The color really enhances my lips without being too bright or too dark. I feel like it makes me look really classy.
RandomActsofMakeup,3dic8p,Ceridwwen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:14:40 2015 UTC,"Does Stila Stay All Day vinyl lip gloss count?  It calls itself a gloss, but it's really more of a liquid lipstick.  Either way, I love their vinyl gloss in Merlot.  It's smooth and velvety without putting any lasting odd flavors on my lips.  When you put it on thicker, it's a striking dark berry red, but after letting it set for a few minutes, it blots/fades away to a smooth matte finish that lasts forever.  I love how it hols up to eating, though drinking can be a bit tricky.  The only downside is that you need to use a liner in order to make it stay in the lines, because it can feather easily if you don't apply it right"

RandomActsofMakeup,3dfy8r,Helenarth,3,Wed Jul 15 23:32:34 2015 UTC,I love my indie perfumes! I put them on and huff at my wrists/arms constantly. They just make me smile and feel good :) Right now I smell like banana bread drizzled in caramel....
RandomActsofMakeup,3dfy8r,doubleosepti,2,Thu Jul 16 00:58:12 2015 UTC,"Is it me, or do some indie perfumes not have the staying power/sillage of regular perfumes? :( I love my indies, but a lot of them seem to vanish within a short amount of time and I can only smell them if I mush my nose onto my wrist.  You gotta tell me what that banana bread/caramel scent is!"
RandomActsofMakeup,3dfy8r,doubleosepti,2,Thu Jul 16 03:24:02 2015 UTC,"Some of them don't last as long, especially the perfume oils. But companies are starting to come out with EDP sprays now which help. And it depends on the company and the scent. I have some that last all day on me, while others vanish in a matter of 60 mins. And the banana bread one is a DC'd scent unfortunately :( But it's by Lou Lou's Soap, Scrubs and Scents on Etsy. It's called Bananawood.  edit: oh, and as for the throw, that's pretty individual to the company/scent as well. But it's one reason I like indies. I can wear them to work and not have to worry about bothering the people around me too much!"
RandomActsofMakeup,3dfy8r,purpleandglitter,2,Thu Jul 16 03:26:53 2015 UTC,"First off, that sounds amazing.   How do you pick scents? I'm kinds nervous to try any indie perfumes"
RandomActsofMakeup,3dfy8r,doubleosepti,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:32:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I knew I liked things with vanilla in them so I looked for perfumes that had a lot of vanilla in them, and one company (Possets) has a vanilla lovers sample pack.  I read a LOT of reviews on IMAM and the internet, and spent oodles of time looking through some of the popular stores. I would eliminate those perfumes that had scents I was pretty sure I wouldn't like (incense, patchouli etc.) and narrowed down my selection.  There are some spreadsheets floating around IMAM with many of the popular companies complete offerings. Very useful for looking through for particular notes.  What's great about many indie stores is you can order samples! So I ordered oodles of samples. Yes, I spent too much money on them, but the nice thing is you can generally destash them and get some of your money back if you don't like them.  I've also seen posts up on IMAM that basically say 'recommend a perfume for me to try' which would give you a a handful of scents to try out.   Half the fun for me is doing the research and trying to find scents that I like! I've only tried about 5 stores so far and due to skin chemistry different stores/perfumes are more/less successful on different people. But if you'd like some recommendations feel free to PM me, or come hang out in /r/indiemakeupandmore with us. :)"

RandomActsofMakeup,3dfy8r,DropDeadShell,2,Thu Jul 16 01:51:35 2015 UTC,"That's a little tough to narrow down! =P  I love Benefit's Dallas. I mostly use it for contouring, but I can also just throw it on my bare face as a blush to give myself some color. =) It really brings out the shape of my face, and makes me look like I get more sun than I actually do!  I also have a perfume I love, Colette by Tocca, that just does something for my confidence when I wear it. I can't describe it, it makes me feel like a grown-up/woman (I'm 27, you'd figure I'd feel ""grown-up"" by now), and like I'm some beautiful, confident, and mature lady. I save it for family gatherings, and anything business/career related. I really love it.  Good question, btw!"

RandomActsofMakeup,3dfc3q,deltacharlie82,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:47:22 2015 UTC,"Hey! This is a great question and one that I have also struggled with. I think the two keys for me were practice and the right brush. When I first started contouring I was using a powder that was too orange for my skin, but eventually I switched to ABH Contour Palette and it has worked better for me. I did have to practice quite a bit, discovering where to place it that looked the most natural. As far as the brush, I had been using a thin, angled brush, and I found that it concentrated too much product in one place, which was hard to blend out. One day, I picked up a Full Flawless Face brush from Bare Minerals. It's is a small, round, fluffy brush with natural bristles. The round shape works great because when I apply it to my face, it is already naturally diffused, so I don't have to blend it out quite as much. I still do some blending. I hope this helps!"
RandomActsofMakeup,3dfc3q,palette_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:29:59 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree about having the right brush. When I use a cream contour I use a small, fluffy but fairly firm brush from Real Techniques (it's a mini one from a travel kit). When I use a powder contour I use this weird little guy from a Bourjois blush, for some reason it works. However, if I swap the brushes and use the RT brush with a powder contour and the Bourjois blush with a cream contour, I look like an idiot."

It definitely looks like my right cheek is more contoured than the other but I dunno I want to play around with heavier contouring but...   I use the ABH contour palette; in the winter I use the ""cooler"" of the colors (the middle one) and the rest of the time I use the one on the far left - it's the lighter of the two warmer colors.   I use the real techniques sculpting brush https://realtechniques.com/images/stories/virtuemart/product/14-pp-0164-dgr12_sculpting-full.jpg  and the coastal scents buffing brush to buff/smooth is out https://realtechniques.com/images/stories/virtuemart/product/14-pp-0164-dgr12_sculpting-full.jpg  I just bought this on hautelook http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0737/8455/products/mb30_1024x1024.jpg?v=1432767252  All of the youtube gurus I watch seem to like the more ""sculpt"" type brushes.

Colourful and fun, not just the boring / trying to look mature/ slather on this and achieve perfect beauty standards kinda makeup in magazines. They were my first real foray into makeup as another way to do colouring in but on my face, to be creative and expressive, and tie in with a facade I presented to the world. I remember making a kind of twisted two colour eyeliner with two colours and water. I still have a soft spot for them and buy new interesting ones when I have the feels. I'm pretty sure my love of loose shadows also stems from using the dazzle dusts, these were colours that showed up on me beautifuly and I could layer without getting chalky and talcy looking.   -Foundation.. its only in the last year if that I've come close to shop bought products that don't look aweful on me. Younger me ended up either looking ashy and deathly pale pinky or orange. I felt weird because I didn't have the skin colour that was supposedly normal. I had pretty bad acne when I was younger and just wanted that smooth, even skin tone like the magazines."

My first ""big girl"" makeup purchase was Smashbox's photo finish eyelid primer. I had always had oily lids, so I didn't wear eyeshadow much because I figured it would all crease on me. UNTIL I found there was such a thing as eyelid primer! From there, my addiction developed til now, I have a seriously wonderful and beautiful collection, and I feel like I know how to apply my makeup that suits me and really enhances my features.

I had never worn nail polish, let alone pink polish, and I was going through a phase of rejecting all things feminine. I got given it as a gift, and was somehow attracted to the colour (a lovely warm pink, very bold) and it was the first polish I ever wore.  As for a product I hated: Bourjois Clubbing Mascara. I needed a new mascara and there was a deal on Bourjois stuff, it was like buy 1 get 1 half price. So I bought that and a lipstick, I think. It somehow managed to be clumpy and runny and flaky all at once, plus it somehow got into my eyes in the middle of the day and made them water, wtf? On the plus side it made me cry black tears which is so metal and edgy, my 13-year-old self would be so proud."

It wasn't the product as much as it was the smell... it smelled amazing!  I also had this periwinkle eyeshadow I adored but never used lol. I think it was mabelline.

It's still to this day the only thing I have scraped at the bottom to get more product of.  I ran away in terror at, believe it or not, a purple lipstick. :( I got a sephora brand one and Idk if it's just the brand or purple is just meant for my clothes, bags, nails etc but it was AWFUL."

Tragically, it always irritated my eyes and it was a while before I realized there was eyeshadow that lasts more than three hours before your eyes tear up too much and it rubs off, but I loved it.  My first eyeliner was the disaster. I got it everywhere and it smudged like nothing else."

RandomActsofMakeup,3df98u,daisyismydog,2,Wed Jul 15 20:42:59 2015 UTC,Hi <3!  I agree that Anastasia Dip Brow is probably your best bet. IIRC you're close to a Sephora that you can go and have a sales associate apply it for you and/or get a sample before purchasing so you can test its longevity (which goes for any other Sephora products people suggest).
RandomActsofMakeup,3df98u,daisyismydog,2,Thu Jul 16 03:54:55 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely going to head over when I have the money and get that done. Thank you!  Also, I miss you! You should come into chat sometime soon!"

RandomActsofMakeup,3df98u,Soruthless,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:07:47 2015 UTC,Another option if you want a similar brow product is Life's Entropy Brow Pomade... I've read some reviews from people who prefer it over the Dip Brow (although I'm sure there are people who prefer Dip Brow instead as well!) and you can get a sample size to try out. Although the store is closed until the 21st I think right now.....

RandomActsofMakeup,3df98u,ladyboss_1,2,Wed Jul 15 20:38:36 2015 UTC,What kind of coverage are you looking for in a matte foundation? I've tried A LOT so I might be able to point you to a few :)   I also have oily skin and I use the UD all nighter setting spray and it works really well at keeping my makeup from sweating off my face. You can get the 1oz bottle for like $14 so it's not too much of an investment if you don't like it.

If it works for you, it's pretty lightweight and fairly cheap. If you want more coverage, I suggest Estee Lauder Double Wear (my current HG); it's matte finish, lasts longer than I ever keep my makeup on, and doesn't look cakey. :)"

Here's me and my froggy!  Skin care routine: I wash with different face washes each day including lush 'let the good times roll' cleanser, nuetrogena wash, and honey. After cleansing, I moisturize with aveeno. Then, apply BB cream and a tiny bit of powder. For days like today when I don't have time for eyeshadow, I just do a simple winged liner with my maybelline gel liner. Then I do my brows with Anastasia brow powder. Last but not least, mascara aaaaand, DONE!  Thanks for hosting :D"

RandomActsofMakeup,3dbwta,klady,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:05:24 2015 UTC,"From what I've read in /r/skincareaddiction, it's actually better for your skin to leave the salicylic acid on your face to get the full benefits of chemical exfoliation. So washing your face before the wipes would be best! I use the wipes to ""wash"" my face and take off my makeup, but I use the almay eye makeup wipes for my eyes :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,3dbwta,Soruthless,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:43:00 2015 UTC,Oh that's an interesting fact I never knew! By washing do you mean just with water or with a cleanser?
RandomActsofMakeup,3dbwta,Soruthless,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:47:34 2015 UTC,"Well apparently the salicylic acid works it's magic after you wipe it on, so I don't think you're supposed to wash it off with water or cleanser, you're supposed to exfoliate AFTER you wash :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,3dbwta,Soruthless,2,Wed Jul 15 05:03:16 2015 UTC,"Here is my FOTD pic 1 and pic 2. I tried out a darker eye than what I usually wear for daytime! I wanted to use the teal color from my ABH Tamanna palette, since I hardly ever use it, and I had an eyeliner mini from MUFE that matched quite perfectly with the shadow, that I used on my bottom lash line. I liked it, but I think I went a tad bit too dark for my liking lol. Oh well! Fun to play! :)  My daily routine consists of washing my face in the shower first. Right now I'm using a citrus cleanser I got in Ipsy, and I've paired that with a salt exfoliant which turns it into a scrub, which feels pretty good. :) Then I moisturize, also using samples from my beauty boxes (right now, I'm using Marcelle Hydra-C). After that, I apply primer (Benefit Porefessional), and then foundation or BB cream. Then concealer under my eyes, and then mascara, eyeshadow, liner, blush, and then I use either a setting powder all over or a setting spray! Oh, and lip balm or lipstick, depending on how played up or down my eyes are! :)"

It's a salt powder, basically, that you add to your face wash to turn it into an exfoliant. Or you can mix it with water and use it alone. I got a sample of it from Beauty Box 5, but here's the product description from Birchbox: ClariSEA Instant Glow Powder."

RandomActsofMakeup,3d6eyt,hardwiredfae,2,Tue Jul 14 00:48:15 2015 UTC,"It would be sleek, functional, and sturdy.

RandomActsofMakeup,3d6eyt,Ceridwwen,2,Tue Jul 14 00:45:05 2015 UTC,"Hm. Well, my favorite packaging is things that are sleek and slim,  like the Lorac palettes and NARS blushes, so it would probably be slim like that. I also love when the packaging matches  the color of the products so that certain colors are easy to pick out when you have a bunch of different colors of the same thing. So I would do that too :)  I wouldn't put mirrors in anything, and I would make everything out of a material that doesn't show fingerprints/dust too easily. And I wouldn't include those stupid crummy brushes that everyone throws out immediately. I would use that space for more product, or just make the packaging smaller so that it doesn't take up necessary space in your storage."
RandomActsofMakeup,3d6eyt,PeaceLoveLindzy,2,Tue Jul 14 03:06:02 2015 UTC,"I want to say it would be relatively sleek and metal-toned, but more likely I would settle on a lot of pastels with lacey or floral patterns.   Most of the lipsticks, etc would have a least a clear window cause I like that shit, and would find a way to make small sizes with actual sturdy packaging."

You stated you like arts and crafts. Could you elaborate more? What is your favorite thing to create? What's your favorite scent in the whole world? Do you like indie makeup? How about nail polish?    That's all for now......be on the lookout though for future clues ;-)

I have a serious anxiety disorder, and crafting is the best thing I've found to help with it! I have made jewelry and LOTS of geeky crafts.  I love citrusy smells! I work at Lush Cosmetics, so I'm surrounded by awesome smells and I can never get enough of lemons, oranges, etc. (I am also weirdly drawn to the smell of freshly blown out candles) I love indies! I have a few things from Shiro and Fyrinnae but would love to expand! I have way too much nail polish! Fitting it all in a new apartment is difficult haha!   Thank for the cute picture, it's so me!!

If it count I am addicted to shimmery lipglosses with blue or gold flecks.  I've been looking for a dupe for Chanel's Dragon forever and need something like that in my collection. Of course it's another red haha. Oh, I wish I could afford them again but my favorites were Petit Vour because of their unique items and the Blush Mystery Beauty which often had full sized products and very high quality items! I was subscribed to about 8 once and things that really bummed me out were paper packet samples and cheap blushes/liners/etc. I do mostly use solid lipsticks but have really like some of the Melted from Too Faced and I do want to try some Kat Von D or LC. I'm absolutely obsessed with lip balms and I love glosses, too, but probably use balms more. Honestly, I love glitters and shimmers the most although recently I've been playing with mattes a bit, too. Ahaha, for me it's definitely eyeliners but I love glittery or silver ones! When on a lengthy trip I carry very minimal makeup with me because I don't want to lose it, HOWEVER, I'll pretend: :D a better eyelash curler (lol), Buxom Lash Mascara, You know Nothing Shiro sample, nude liner, LORAC Pro palette, face primer, and UDPP.

I tend to stick with darker colors in the winter (I have dark skin so I can wear basically anything)  and brighter ones in the summer. Sometimes I get little strokes of inspiration, though, and I'll wear dark lipstick when it's sunny out and really bright summery colors in the winter. It really just depends on how I feel that day.

RandomActsofMakeup,3cxmac,Soruthless,7,Sat Jul 11 20:44:41 2015 UTC,"Uhm, there was a sticky stating that they were going to be late. There are reasons, life gets in the way. Being trite about it doesn't help and we should be stoked they're even doing this at all. The mods don't get paid for all the time they put into keeping this place up and running, including exchanges like this. There's a lot to exchanges; matching up participants, watching for scammers, and tracking that every participant to ensure that no one gets screwed over.   I was a little late sending out my secret Cupid, only due to shipping issues with Sephora. I kept the mods (and my Cupid) that were assigned to my tier abreast of the situation and was not banned from exchanges or this sub. All it takes is a message.   You should seriously reconsider your tone and your attitude when it comes to things being late. You don't know what happened behind the scenes.

RandomActsofMakeup,3cwhhj,Brikachu,3,Sat Jul 11 11:51:23 2015 UTC,"I have  several colors of their matte lipsticks and the lightest one I have just doesn't go on evenly at all. It's like very patchy or something. I still kept it because I can kind of even it out with gloss...which defeats the purpose of having a matte lip color, but I liked the color so it's ok."
RandomActsofMakeup,3cwhhj,petunialou,2,Sat Jul 11 13:25:39 2015 UTC,I've had mine for a few months but never wear it because it was separating already. Tried mixing it but dried flakes from the call kept making it chunky. It's also extremely patchy on my lips and nothing I've tried will make it my solid.   I personally think the soft matte lip creams are awesome but Transylvania just seems to be a dud.
RandomActsofMakeup,3cwhhj,storyteller623,2,Sat Jul 11 13:38:38 2015 UTC,I had the other dark one...Copenhagen? And it was so patchy and frustrating.   I have a lot of the other ones and they're so easy to wear. Monte Carlo wasn't so good either.
RandomActsofMakeup,3cwhhj,Zannahquinn,2,Sat Jul 11 17:41:32 2015 UTC,"I have that one and I have no problem with it separating or being oily. I usually do a couple swipes of it though to get it nice and even. I have probably 10+ of the matte creams and only two (this one and a light pink one I can't remember) are the only two I have any problem with it coming out even on the first swipe. Maybe try another transylvania, could be a bad batch?"
RandomActsofMakeup,3cwhhj,InChuckWeTrust,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:05:19 2015 UTC,"I don't like it.The color is strange. It feathers badly and looks bad. I have four other shades of that formula and they're way better. I suggest you try Prague or Copenhagen if you're looking for something on the darker side. I wouldn't let Transylvania influence what you think of the product itself too much. :)   For reference, I have Prague, Copenhagen, San Paulo, and Transylvania. Transylvania is, by far, my least favorite and the one I wear the least often."

I'm also pretty pants at applying liquid lipsticks anyway, though."
RandomActsofMakeup,3cwhhj,anathea,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:20:55 2015 UTC,"I don't have Transylvania, but I do have another one (Antwerp) and I do feel that it does spread unevenly.

Or you could do the base colour one day and do the striping the next. The polish doesn't have to be super dried to use striping tape, just dry enough.

RandomActsofMakeup,3crgxv,doctorwhore,2,Sun Jul 12 05:23:42 2015 UTC,"I really want the Lorac Pro Contour Palette. The new Tarte palette too. Also I tried this tarte lippie in Sephora a couple weeks back and I'd totally buy it if I remembered what it was. And another mystery product: I saw a nail polish in Target that said it self-healed (like if you dented it, it would smooth out again) but I don't remember what it was. I thought it was Essie...but I can't find it online.   Edit: It was Orly!"

One skin-coloured one as a base, a bright colour over the lid, darker over the entire crease, darkest in the corner. Y'know, the standard smokey.  Sometimes I go bold and mix it up, but those cases rarely ever leave the house."

RandomActsofMakeup,3co4lf,Zannahquinn,3,Thu Jul 9 13:57:18 2015 UTC,"Oh gosh... 9? 10? I was experimenting and didn't like how some colors looked so I layered over them, otherwise it'd be closer to 4 or 5. I used theBalm's Nude Tude shades Sultry (crease/transition), Sexy (outer 1/4 plus crease), Serious (deepening outer V), Sassy and Snobby (inner corner highlight), and then Lorac PRO Gold and Coastal Scents American Rose and Raisin Berry layered on the lid, with Coastal Scents Chamois Nude as a skin tones blending shade. So 9 then.   Edit: Peecture"
RandomActsofMakeup,3co4lf,ciestaconquistador,3,Thu Jul 9 15:37:28 2015 UTC,I think my highest ever was 4. Blending still escapes me a bit.  Am I the only person who can't use black eyeshadow at all?

RandomActsofMakeup,3co4lf,kellycblue,2,Thu Jul 9 13:57:19 2015 UTC,"I usually end up using like 12 for absolutely no real reason. I do purple looks a lot, so I have lots of purples. Often though, the purple in a palette looks the same as 5 other purples when on my skin but I don't remember this for more than 30 seconds at a time. I also end up cycling through my blacks as I decide I want a less black black, put it on, decide I want more black then just end up with my blackest black by the end. I'm a little slow. Hey, my looks don't look super muddy (though, I can't ever get my really gorgeous purples to translate to camera) they just don't look like I have 12 different colors on my eyes.  Recently, I've been using the Saucebox Etude and Batalash palettes, so I'm working with 8 or fewer colors... I've even managed to get down to like 5. I might have a problem."

RandomActsofMakeup,3cjomj,okkraa,3,Wed Jul 8 13:03:06 2015 UTC,I think the new Benefit ones are really nice. All the ones I've messed with have been nice and pigmented and easy to mess with.
RandomActsofMakeup,3cjomj,AnchorsAway2009,2,Wed Jul 8 13:25:09 2015 UTC,This is what I was going to say! I swatched them all in store and ended up taking the green one home. I have some other colored eyeliners that end up sitting in my drawer because they're not really wearable. But this one is really wearable! I love it!
RandomActsofMakeup,3cjomj,palette_,2,Wed Jul 8 20:17:27 2015 UTC,"Right! That's what I like about them. Ulta just got some new colored eyeliners that are also super smooth and pigmented and I swatched a lot of them. Might have to pick up a couple, but Benefit remains my favorite so far."
RandomActsofMakeup,3cjomj,AnchorsAway2009,3,Wed Jul 8 21:12:08 2015 UTC,Navy blue.  It's really subtle and less harsh on my skin than black is.  It's also a great summer color.
RandomActsofMakeup,3cjomj,redreplicant,2,Wed Jul 8 14:02:43 2015 UTC,Hmmm I hadn't really considered navy blue before. I think doing a navy blue eyeliner would be great for someone who's cautious about wearing blue eyeshadow.
RandomActsofMakeup,3cjomj,MissyTX,3,Wed Jul 8 17:37:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of blue and purple. Purple really brings the green out of my eyes, and the blue just looks SO pretty against a champagne eye shadow."
RandomActsofMakeup,3cjomj,marashade,3,Wed Jul 8 14:51:16 2015 UTC,Teal or turquoise on the bottom lash line has been my current favorite.
RandomActsofMakeup,3cjomj,crescentice,3,Wed Jul 8 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"Purple! My eyes are a really dark brown and sometimes they look black, but whenever I use purple eyeliner the brown really pops! Make up for ever in 11L is my favorite. I typically just line the top of my lid with it, or sometimes I'll do under my eye. Sometimes I also like to pair it with a purple mascara."
RandomActsofMakeup,3cjomj,Inquisitions,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:34:09 2015 UTC,"This is why I like wearing Rockstar.

Is there another one you like?"
RandomActsofMakeup,3cjomj,MintyLotus,2,Thu Jul 9 02:25:52 2015 UTC,"My favorites to wear are burgundy, olive green, and purple. The majority of my eyeliners are shades of brown, but when I want that but of color I reach for one of these. (In order, stila Deep Burgundy, stila Moray, and Urban Decay Rockstar.)   With marsala being color of the year, I was hoping we'd see some pencil eyeliners in that shade, but I haven't seen any yet."

They feel sturdy enough even though they are lightweight.  The hairs are very soft, pick up product and blend well.  I think they are softer and more versatile than my Real Techniques eye and face sets.  After using them and washing them several times they aren't shedding at all. :)  I have a metric crap ton of photos including close ups and comparisons with my Real Techniques brushes on my blog.  I'll try to post them to reddit in a day or two but wanted to let you know that I like them and would recommend them because they are on sale on Hautelook again and only cost $32 right now!

I actually just finished reading the review on your blog, I think it was really well done and appreciated the photo comparisons with your other brushes. I have like, 5 Eco Tools brushes and have been considering getting an upgrade. I especially need eye/brow brushes! I used to just use my fingers all the time but I've been trying to do more interesting looks that require brushes now, I think these look like a good choice for a nice mid-price point option! I'm just not willing to shell out all that cash on MAC and similar."

I really like the eye brushes in this set. I think they were smart with the variety!  The face brushes are really good but the eye brushes totally make it for me. :)    I can't afford MAC or sigma brushes. I just have too many responsibilities!  My one Mac brush was a hand me down from my sister in law so I know they hold up well but I still can't justify spending hundreds of dollars on their brushes.
RandomActsofMakeup,3cinah,purpleandglitter,4,Wed Jul 8 05:11:43 2015 UTC,"There are certain products that I've fallen in love with and other things that I can't stand.   The things I love:   Lip Exfoliator HD Loose Powder - To me this is just as good as the Make Up For Ever HD Powder and a lot cheaper. I'm not crazy about the packaging though. It's bulky and I wish there was a closure on the sifter like Bare Minerals.  Studio Matte Lip Color in Tea Rose - I especially love this color when I wear my throwback ""grunge"" look Studio Small Stipple Brush - Excellent for applying pigmented blushes.  Studio Flawless Concealer Brush - I LOVE this brush. I own two and I plan on buy at least two more. By far some of my favorite brushes that I own. Excellent for blending out concealer, setting undereye concealer, contour along the sides of my nose...I just love this brush so much.    Now for things I hated:   Essential Expert Liquid Liner - I hated the applicator and the pigmentation was not there. I hated this damn thing.    ....That's about all of my hate lol"

RandomActsofMakeup,3cinah,Jess_Starfire,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:15:31 2015 UTC,I really like the $3 small stippling brush for my cream blushes. The hd translucent setting powder is fantastic too. Their studio matte lipstick is okay but the range is small and a little weird.   The smudge pot is actually my favorite ELF product. I use WnW fergie eye primer and then tap and blend the smudge pot over my lid and then blend up to my brow bone. It's really only visible on my lid but the texture blends up all the way of that makes any sense.   If I do that before I do my eyeshadow it will. Not. Move. I slept in my makeup after a very long night of party and woke up with my eyeshadow looking immaculate.  It's not just a HG. Its a godsend for hooded eye girls.

I use it every time before showering, it seemed to take about 3 dyes to finally take a REAL blue. at first it was green/teal, more green. I left it on much longer than 30 minutes this last time and it seemed to do well.  & thank you! funnily enough I never wear bronze or brown colors on the eyes. now my mind has quickly changed the more I use them."

RandomActsofMakeup,3cc3al,okkraa,2,Mon Jul 6 21:42:42 2015 UTC,I used to make myself wear makeup every single day but forcing myself to put on a full face every day was making me hate makeup.

Doing that makes it feel more like a hobby than a chore.   TL;DR No

I get to paint my face every day!  Plus, I look sick without make up on. I look tired and run down. Once, a neighbour called me over to their house for drinks and I didn't have any make up on yet, so I wore my sunglasses over and intentionally did not take those suckers off for the whole visit.  It:s proving to be a mighty big challenge for me right now, though. I just had a baby three weeks ago, and he isn't super fond of letting me out my face on. With a post-partum bod I'm not thrilled with, a limited wardrobe and a very exhausted make-up-up-free look right now, I certainly don't feel my best!"

I'm having to scale down my makeup collection due to a change in circumstances so I've downgraded from the Illamasqua Skin Base Foundation to a BB cream. So far, I'm liking the switch. Especially since the foundation was so damned expensive, the BB cream is a much cheaper alternative and I'm liking it.  I also got the Secret Kiss Chubby Jelly Lip Tint Pack in Cherry Red and... wow.

It makes my lashes look super long, jet black, and keeps my curl all day long. I applied this at 9 yesterday morning, came home around 11:30 at night and my lashes looked exactly the same.

If you only use it once a day with your kabuki brush, I'd say try it out in a couple different lights, that simulate your job location/school/ whathaveyou. to see if you still like the undertones in those lights.

Back when I used to wear foundation I loved their healthy skin liquid makeup (it matched perfect but I don't like the heaviness of foundation). I also love Nutrogena eye liner.
RandomActsofMakeup,3cb5gh,koshershiksa,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:51:29 2015 UTC,Neutrogena made me angry with the heavy feeling with no color payoff. But I do like the skincare. I recently have been getting back into Loreal and Maybelline after a couple drugstore purchases made me quit Nyx and Revlon. Seems like Loreal and Maybelline both stepped up their game. I guess mergers can be a good thing?
RandomActsofMakeup,3cb5gh,palette_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:57:23 2015 UTC,I love Maybelline. I've never had a bad product from them. Their polish is a little thin but for the price it stays on my nails for a good 3-4 days without chipping.   I really love the Nutrogena nourishing eye liner. I love the colors (I use the brushed pewter and spiced chocolate). I like the sort of softer roll up crayon eyeliner. I used to use the maybelline ones but they never have my color in stock when I go to buy it.  I will say the worst eyeliner I ever user from a decent brand was almay. I wasn't able to get a decent opaque line on my eye with that stuff. It just wouldn't work for me.   And I haven't tried any of the neutrogena skin care. I have super sensitive skin. Is it any good?
RandomActsofMakeup,3ca441,LadyBosie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:02:25 2015 UTC,"After seeing a few inspiring posts today, I really want to work on improving my eye-makeup skills - particularly shadow! I currently do pretty decent every day makeup, but every time I try something more complex it ends in disaster. My biggest struggle is getting really great color payoff while still having smooth, blended edges. I use high-quality eyeshadows so I know that is not the issue. I thought maybe I needed high-quality brushes too to do some of the looks I have seen, but I asked a friend who had really amazing eyeshadow what brushes she used and they were some of the cheapest ones out there! So I guess it must be my technique.   I really want to do it but I always get so frustrated when it looks terrible and don't try it again for a few months, obviously I need to practice more to get better! I think this afternoon I'm going to try doing some looks following video tutorials for the Naked 2 Palette to get me started, if anyone has any advice or great tutorial links let me know!  I want my eyeshadow to look beautiful and crisp like these but mine always just look like these.  These aren't current pics and I feel like my eyeliner skills have way improved since then but my eyeshadow looks exactly the same. It just seems like when I try to blend, it buffs away half of the shadow and I do it over and over but still never get very intense colors, or because I want the color I don't blend enough which looks awkward."

(Per usual) I tried some new things I just got on my eyes, Lorac Pro 2, Miss Manga Rock Mascara, messed around with false lashes. Then after I took all that off I used this bb cushion sample I got from sephora a while back. I put it all over, even on my eyelids. Maybe 20 minutes later I looked and the mirror and my eyelids were swollen. They looked like I'd been crying for hours. I woke up this morning and they were still a bit swollen. I took Benadryl, so I hope it goes away. My main problem is that I don't know exactly what it was, since I tried so many new things last night. I hope it was the lash glue or bb cushion.

I think Beauty Marked just screams Elena as she was always marked for her future as a dóppelganger. Plus she's stunning and I think the colour would be amazing on her.  For Damon I'd pick Deep truth for matching his eyes and then he's had to face some hard truths about his feelings for Elena.  Stefan I'd prob go with something dark like Black Tied as he really is the darkest character (when he goes Ripper and what he did to Damon) but there's always flashes of humanity so the silver shots of glitter would show it.  Caroline would have to be Gorgeous Gold cos well she's gorgeous has golden blonde hair and always see's the golden side of things.

RandomActsofMakeup,3byqlp,ladyboss_1,2,Sat Jul 4 00:21:37 2015 UTC,"I have a few tricks that I like to employ.  Instead of shelling out $$$ for fancy primers, I buy monistat anti-chafing gel to use as a face primer.  Seriously, it's on par with e.l.f. or ulta brand face primers, and a fraction of the cost!  For me, the monistat costs about $5 for a 1.5 oz tube.  One tube lasts me about a year, in addition to using it occasionally for its original intended purpose.  Just don't use too much or it pills up really badly.  I keep my coffee grounds after each pot because I mostly use them to fertilize my houseplants.  Every so often, I'll take a scoop of them and mix them with a bit of olive oil and use them to exfoliate my scalp.  It's a bear to wash out if you have longer hair, but it's always made my hair looked shinier and softer, and it can especially brighten up brunettes.  Because I have moderately to heavy hooded eyes, I often apply my makeup with my eyes open.  I sketch out the lines before I blend everything in place.  This last tip isn't related to makeup/beauty at all, but instead for the heat.  If you don't have air conditioning, but need to cool down, store damp handkerchiefs or washclothes in the freezer.  You can wrap them around you and help cool down you down.  Alternatively, take a two liter bottle(Or whatever size works for you) and fill it with water part way.  Make sure it has space for expansion, as you're gonna freeze it.  when it's good and solid, you take it out, put it on a towel in front of your fan, and enjoy the breeze."
RandomActsofMakeup,3byqlp,Ceridwwen,2,Fri Jul 3 07:44:36 2015 UTC,"For an intense but well blended/diffused highlight, apply a cream product like Watts Up on the highest points, gently diffuse the edges, then apply a dusting of powder highlight (like Hard Candy Tiki bronzer) on top. The powder highlight will be a little softer and cover a bit more area for extra glow that doesn't look unnatural."
RandomActsofMakeup,3byqlp,MintyLotus,2,Fri Jul 3 13:04:25 2015 UTC,Mixing the wet n wild long lasting lipsticks and my nyx butter lipstick in a similar color is fantastic. First wet n wild because its drying and won't budge then nyx butter to make a shine and make it less drying.  I didn't know this until watching a youtuber but everyone else will but ill say it for the few. Contour with cool tone bronzers and warm your face with warm ones. I stopped looking dirty after that one.  Angled brush for my crease changed my life. Its not so harsh now.
RandomActsofMakeup,3byqlp,Mrs_C_W,2,Fri Jul 3 14:49:51 2015 UTC,"Oh, I like this contest! I like hearing different tricks.  So for my winged liner, I always get the wing to line up with my lower lash line like this. It comes out pretty perfect every time by doing that.   If my eyeballs are puffy from allergies or whatever, I steep some tea and put the warm tea bags on my eyes. After about 5 minutes it makes them noticeably less puffy.   Have a lipstick you like but want it to be matte? Take some toilet paper and rip the ply in half so that the toilet paper is thinner. After applying your lipstick, put the toilet paper on top of your lips and take a clear face powder and blot it over the toilet paper over your lips. It'll make your lippie matte :D   I have some others, I'll post them if I remember them."

This is a pretty well known trick, but I love using scotch tape to create precise edges with my eyeshadow/eyeliner. I just recently started doing this and let me tell you, it is SUCH a time saver. I use tape even when I'm skipping eyeshadow and just wearing eyeliner. It's almost impossible to mess up a good wing when you have a perfect stencil. Definitely recommend!"
RandomActsofMakeup,3byqlp,ShiyoxTheAlicorn,2,Fri Jul 3 06:50:39 2015 UTC,That sounds like a great idea! The only problem I think I'd have with that is making the stencil for both eyes equal and even. That's why I tend to stay away from wings.
RandomActsofMakeup,3byqlp,chunkopunk,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:02:32 2015 UTC,"I like to put on a matte primer over lipstick to give it a matte look and it helps stay on longer. It looks like a stain if you do like a line of color on you hand or some other surface then mix it with the primer and apply with a brush, but I usually just put a dap on my finger and run it over my lipstick.   This is more of a preference than a tip but I find that blush looks more natural when you apply it with your finger tips than a brush. I sometimes use an eye shadow or lipstick as well as blush.   Dont lean really close to a mirror when doing your eyebrows. sit back a bit, it makes it easier to make sure they're going to look strong and even. Then go in and just blend it out or fill in any spots that may have managed to be missed. Whenever I lean in too close I don't make them dark enough so if I'm standing and talking to someone at a normal distance it still doesn't look like I have eyebrows. Far away helps gauge how its actually going to look to others because generally people aren't 3inches in front of your face haha   I also use a kabuki brush with my HD translucent powder when I am completely done with my makeup and ""buff"" all over just to make sure anywhere needs more blending. It also helps my makeup last longer."

I do primer-powder-concealer-foundation, and it's a noticeable difference in getting my makeup to last. The concealer part is the true blessing of it, since it seems to let my concealer stick better and not rub off/disappear."

RandomActsofMakeup,3byqlp,Cecilia5026,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:05:44 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty commonly known one, but one I live by because it makes all the difference. Put concealer on after you lay on your foundation, your coverage will be much better and you won't accidentally move your concealer after all of your hard work.   Also, use oils as makeup remover. Coconut oil and olive oil are two popular choices, so long as they play nice with your skin. I love how soft olive oil makes my face feel, and it works the best to get off stila's notoriously good liquid liner."
RandomActsofMakeup,3byqlp,thedoyleowl,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:34:02 2015 UTC,One of the things I hate is when I have the perfect eyeshadow look and then accidentally get mascara on my eyelids or below my eye. Use a little piece of paper or a plastic spoon to cover the area behind your lashes so the mascara doesn't go onto your skin. Another trick for this is to look downward into a handheld mirror when applying to the top lashes.

Your winged liner is perfect, the boo-boo you made with your lipliner disappears, the area where you went a little too crazy with the brow pencil is covered.

RandomActsofMakeup,3byqlp,MisoPlas,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:44:44 2015 UTC,"The best trick I've learned, I don't use everyday but more like on a night out, is to use scotch tape, line it up with the lower lash to create a sharp line where the shadow/liner stops for a smoky eye/wing, make it so much easier. I always put the tape on my hand first so i lose some of the stickiness, you don't want to hurt your eye."
RandomActsofMakeup,3byqlp,srs5222,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:03:51 2015 UTC,"The tip I have is for lipstick. Sometimes there are those who don't have translucent powder or a lip liner with the same color.

Here are my top three:   Use a cold compress mask on my eyes to reduce puffiness. Use a cotton bud (q-tip) to pick up a lot of Rosebud Salve (or whatever lip balm) and rub that all over my lips if they are feeling dehydrated. Then, I used the dry side of the q-tip to rub around on my lips to really exfoliate and work the moisture in. Conceal puffiness and dark circles around my eyes using the method from in this video.

All you need is your polish and a bowl of ice water! After you paint each layer, let it dry for about a minute, and then plunge all your nails into the ice water for a minute. Then let them sit and air dry, and then do the next layer, repeating the ice water step, until you're done. It takes longer than a normal mani but the results last longer, I swear!

Also, if you ran out of makeup remover and are in need of a quick fix, usually lotion works just as good - this is especially nice if let's say, you're trying to touch up with Q-tips and don't have any makeup remover on hand, but carry a little bit of moisturizer/lotion.  *edit: not sure if this counts as an actual makeup technique, but it helps me when doing my make up"

Mascara on bottom lashes: I learned this from a friend when we were like 14, how to apply mascara to the bottom lashes without mascara getting all over your skin. Just hold the brush horizontally and swipe it across the lashes. Then I use the ""dry brush"" to comb them downwards. You could also use the card trick to do this, but I find my method easier."

However, just filling them in with the nude lip liner can look a little dull... sooo, I add a hint of light pink liquid lipstick to the centre of my lips and blend it in to create a gradient. It adds a lot of life to nude lips!  In the genius words of Mathu Anderson 'brighten any dead beige with pink lemonade!'"

So far I've used the Kat Von D Lock-It foundation, and the Make Up For Ever HD foundation. I started out with the Kat Von D and thought that I must have gotten the wrong shade because upon application, it looked very orange and completely my wrong shade in natural light. So, I went back to Sephora and got matched with my shade again and was referred to the shade N117 in the Make Up For Ever foundation. I thought this was a better fit until I went outside and am having the same problem. I haven't really used any primers in the past, though I have just started using the Porefessional. Any idea as to why this is happening? Is there anything I can do to fix this issue?  Edit: I don't know if it matters, but I have very light skin, acne, and combination skin with a lot of redness. The oily part is really only my nose, and I get dry in my T zone and cheek areas.   TL;DR: Having an issue with foundation oxidizing on my skin and can't figure out why it's happening."

I use it a lot when I start with a matte eye look, then decide I want to add a bit of shimmer :-)    Their Vibrant In Vancouver palette was the first real palette I ever bought.

I semi-recently discovered the brand a year or so ago when on the quest for a black liquid eyeliner that was actually waterproof.  It has become one of my absolute favorite makeup items.  I was told by a Stila rep/trainer that the liquid liners are now made with a dye instead of a pigment, making it last longer on your face.  She also mentioned this being the reason they don't carry any reds or purples in liquids (yet) since red dye is not recommended for eye use.  It's my HG liner, I store it cap-down with the rest of my liners and have no issues with it drying out.  I also love their liquid lipsticks.  The new colors are so pretty!  There are a few of the original colors that are gorgeous, but other than those few I wasn't wanting to purchase any more because many looked too similar.  I know TONS of people that hate this product, but I've recently become obsessed with their Magnificent Metal shadows.  The application process is super weird- sitting on my bathtub edge while mixing powder and liquid together on a small silver tray makes me feel like I'm doing drugs.  But NO, I'm just making beautiful eyeshadow.  I've only had these for like a week so I'm still getting the consistency part down, but I love the look of it on.  Their aqua glow water blush is super sheer at first and so pretty.  The aqua glow primer is weird and kind of bad in my opinion.  Feels nice immediately after putting it on, but that sensation leaves and my skin feels like it did before.  Their primers in general aren't my jam.  The foundation coverage and formula is nice for me, but what the hell is with that weird spatula thing?  Enough about me and my Stila experiences, has anyone tried their mascaras?"

Or a ""two-toned"" eye look, where you pair two differently colored eyeshadows together to form a cohesive look. Like this or this.  An ombre lip day would be super fun! Pink ombre could be very wearable for work!  And my final idea is a day where you all use the makeup that's stashed at the very bottom/back of your collection! Use the makeup you never use... make a challenge out of creating an entire face with ONLY your rarely-used items in your collection. This can help you rediscover a love for an item, or on the other hand it can make you realize that you don't really want to keep that item around! :)"

Each girl chooses only one brand to complete her look, e.g. Mac, Too Faced, Nyx, etc.   If you're feeling up to it, you all can put down a bunch of ""looks"" on slips like ""red lip"" or ""smokey eyes"", put em in a hat or bowl and you can randomly draw for the following day!"

RandomActsofMakeup,3bftra,klady,3,Sun Jun 28 21:12:00 2015 UTC,"You should try Double Wear by Estee Lauder, I have really oily skin too and recently started using it and it lasts a lot longer than any other foundation I've tried"
RandomActsofMakeup,3bftra,EvrythngSux,2,Sun Jun 28 22:49:18 2015 UTC,"Same! I used to use Bourjois gel foundation, but it just stopped working for me for some reason. I switched to this last month and I've never been happier- it was definitely worth the money. I use a MUFE nourishing primer and finish the with Bare Essentials translucent powder.   OP- ask for a sample if you really want one! Ask for three samples from three different foundations! That's what it's there for (and to minimize returns). They expect it, so don't feel shy asking for one. The only way you'll know if a foundation works for you is if you wear it throughout the day."
RandomActsofMakeup,3bftra,coulditbejanuary,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:10:13 2015 UTC,"As someone who's new to makeup and gets anxious about finding the right foundation, this is great advice. I somehow forgot that samples were a thing, lol.  Much appreciated!"
RandomActsofMakeup,3bftra,itsapraxis,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:48:25 2015 UTC,"No problem! When I was trying to find my perfect fits, I took home like six primers and a few different foundations. As long as you're sincere with the sales person and has done a little bit of research, they're generally really happy to grab a sample. (Going in the morning is best though, before they have too many weird/awful customers)"
RandomActsofMakeup,3bftra,coulditbejanuary,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:02:05 2015 UTC,"Good advice, thank you!! The nearest Sephora to me is 4 hours away, so unfortunately I kinda blew it when I didn't ask for a sample while I was there. :( I was just hoping that by asking about good foundations for oily skin, that she would offer some samples, but she seemed intent on showing me the one shade that worked for me, and then wanting me to buy it. Like.... I can't buy foundation without trying it all day first.... not with my skin! :/"
RandomActsofMakeup,3bftra,madgeinaryfriend,3,Wed Jul 1 05:17:27 2015 UTC,I used the Kat Von D Light 44 for the longest time but I found it doesn't last through the day with being oily. I use Grease Lightening from Lush before everything and then Tarte Amazonian Clay foundation in Light Neutral and apply it with an ELF brand small stipling brush I got from SaveMart. I find that applying it like that keeps it nice and light on my face and helps with oil!
RandomActsofMakeup,3bftra,Anita89,2,Sun Jun 28 23:40:06 2015 UTC,The naked line works for me with the Becca primer. I can not wear any makeup without a primer.
RandomActsofMakeup,3bftra,luckyshell,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:42:29 2015 UTC,"I would try hourglass. They have a specific formulation for very oily skin.  It's on the expensive side, so if you are interested in it, get matched using their skin matcher and pick your shade! But don't buy it until you've tried it for a day or too.  That skin matcher is crazy good. Got my MUFE shade on point!"
RandomActsofMakeup,3bftra,chicky08tink,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:34:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, thank you! I don't mind spending a little more if I really like it, but yes, I'd definitely want to try it first! :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,3bftra,chicky08tink,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:20:39 2015 UTC,"I agree on Double Wear! But I also wanted to add, one thing I have found helps a lot is using the ""Goss method"" to apply my foundation. At first, I thought it was a crock of sht mainly because I didn't *really have oily skin so it didn't work at first but recently my hormones have gotten out of control and now I have relatively oily skin so i decided to give it a try and BOY OH BOY did it work! This is how I did my foundation for my wedding day which included an hour of outside time in very humid 95 degree weather and it really lasted all night.   Basically, the Goss method just tells you to:   Apply moisturizer/primer Apply powder (setting powder - does not need to be powder foundation) Apply liquid foundation If more coverage is required add more powder YOU'RE DONE! No further setting required    If you need further explanation, you can look up the Goss method by Wayne Goss on YouTube. Hope it helps!"

I don't think they're trying to be mean or anything but I don't think they go out of their way to talk to me like they do with other people. The two coworkers we'll call Jack and Emily. I think Jack likes Emily so he tries to get all the alone time he can with her. But Emily is in a serious relationship and is definitely not interested in Jack. Emily is really nice and we have a lot of things in common but Jack always hogs her for conversation.   This sounds like a horrible high school problem hahaha. It just gets lonely when I'm at work for 8 hours and they barely talk to me. I sound silly xD
RandomActsofMakeup,3bdvpx,melleewants_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:41:24 2015 UTC,"Not at all. 8 hours is a long time for someone to be sitting at their desk and not talk to anyone.

No matter what product I use or how many layers I apply of fingernail polish, it's chipping before the day is over, and the next day it's not even worth having on. Is there some kind of secret to applying nail polish that I dont know? Everyone else seems to have perfect nails :("
RandomActsofMakeup,3bac2f,AuntyM,3,Sun Jun 28 00:52:59 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem and was recommended a few products. One is a ph bond base that is supposed to correct your nails ph so the polish can stay on your nail better. Some people skip this product and just use regular rubbing alcohol. Going a step further, you can use a sticky base I don't always use this, but it definitely helps.   If it's just the tips of your nails that coming off. You might need a better top coat. Most people like seche vite but if I'm really trying to get my polish to stay on, I'll use a gel polish top coat this one doesn't need a light."

RandomActsofMakeup,3b428w,ArtichokeTho,4,Thu Jun 25 20:13:45 2015 UTC,"I think your makeup has the perfect amount of drama for that dress. It's a very glamorous dress so I think a more natural look would fade away in comparison. I agree with you, I think the darkness of the smokey eye is nice as is, without more of a highlight. A bit hard to tell from a distance, though.  Two things I would tweak: add a bit more/a slightly brighter blush, again because the color of the dress is so gorgeous and rich, you want to have a bit more color on your face to balance it.   Secondly, I would go for a lipstick that's either a shade or too lighter, or a shade or two more pink-y toned. The reason I say this is that your dress is a very true red, while your lipstick is almost more terra cotta, a very warm color. You might want to find a nude lip that's a bit more neutral in undertone so that it doesn't clash with the dress.  Overall you look great! Have fun!!"
RandomActsofMakeup,3b428w,mkguyote,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:30:04 2015 UTC,Thank you!! Do you have any shades you'd recommend? I don't have any more nudes but I could do a bit of last minute panic shopping :) Definitely will add more blush- thank you!

RandomActsofMakeup,3b428w,LinzDarling,2,Fri Jun 26 05:52:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with the cheeks as they should be a bit more dramatic. Not overly pink or red, just a bit more emphasis. Or you could go red lips. I mean real red, maybe a matt. Give it a try. Your eyes look wonderful. Overall, you look radiant. Have fun with your look and enjoy prom."

RandomActsofMakeup,3ayo0d,Perky_Penguin,9,Wed Jun 24 15:44:39 2015 UTC,You can do your makeup at home it will probably ease your mind by not forgetting something!  Just take some touch up makeup with you and they can take your makeup pictures while you do that too win win !!
RandomActsofMakeup,3ayo0d,princessbubbleguum,5,Wed Jun 24 16:03:44 2015 UTC,"Congrats! I just got married a little less than a month ago and I did my makeup myself. I did my makeup in my hotel room and just sat by a window to get the best lighting possible. Like others have said, you could just do your makeup at home and bring with you some powder, lipstick, and maybe mascara and do those when you get there? I mean, for the getting ready pictures, they usually just do lipstick since you don't really want pictures of yourself barefaced putting on foundation lol. The only thing I would say about this route is to make sure you time it properly. Figure out how long of a time it will be between being home, doing your makeup and when you will be at the venue. Are you getting your hair done before your makeup? What is the weather like? Is it hot and humid to where your makeup might run a bit? What I did is that I waited for the last possible moment to do my makeup (I started about 45 mins before I needed to put on my dress and go take pictures with my husband)."
RandomActsofMakeup,3ayo0d,chicky08tink,3,Wed Jun 24 18:30:30 2015 UTC,"not married, but I was just MOH in a wedding in May. I did my own makeup and the bride had an MUA.   Our prep room was very well lit and I wet my bb in the powder room down the hall. my main problem was actually having to sit to do my makeup bc I didn't have a big mirror with me!"

RandomActsofMakeup,3ayo0d,Roses88,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:48:59 2015 UTC,"I hired a makeup artist and had my makeup done in a hotel room.   Per my photographer's suggestion: I was the last person to get my hair/makeup done and the photographer showed up about 10 minutes before I was done. She took some photos of my finishing touches and had the MUA stage a few. I put my dress on, took more.    I don't see why you couldn't do your makeup at home, bring what you'd need for touchups and finish at the venue. The only downside is that you won't have pictures of your full makeup setup if that's your thing. I didn't realize my photographer had even taken pictures of my MUA's kit until we got the pictures back, but they were a nice detail shot of something I'd really not remember otherwise."

We took our pictures before the wedding also, so I just had her touch me up before the wedding ceremony (she is my stylist and friend so she attended the wedding too). But... I totally regret letting her do my face. It turned out worse than the trial makeup, and it didn't look like the real me... Brows were way different than I like (too light), eye makeup was too heavy. But I just went with it because I didn't know enough about makeup back then to realize what truly works for me. Now, after 2 years on RAoM, there's no way I'd let someone do such important makeup for me, but live and learn. :("

Both are smooth, pigmented and don't have fallout like other brands I have tried. (Closest might be the Too Faced matte eye palette I have, but that seriously lacks pigmentation). The matte one doubles as a blush too. The pans are huge so I think they are well worth their price. I've been very satisfied with them and look forward to trying more products from MUFE.

The girl who matched me at Sephora made the whole experience awesome, so I wasn't too surprised when I started wearing it and LOVED it.  It actually matches my skin, it wears super well, and the bottle has lasted me forever.  Then I got a job at the other makeup store and made myself find another comparable foundation so I can use my discount.  I'm trying to make what I have left last forever.  I don't own any of their other products, but I've used a few eyeshadows from my friends and was very impressed.  I want to eventually purchase more of their line!"

I use the aqua eyes cream shadow in copper as a base for a brown smokey eye look.   I've used the HD setting powder a few times.  I really like it but it's a bit pricey,  so I haven't repurchased it.   I have one of their lipsticks in a classic red which is my go to for a bold red lip.

RandomActsofMakeup,3aqsqu,PeopleInMyHead,2,Tue Jun 23 01:40:12 2015 UTC,"Like the other person said, it's soft looking but looks good. If you really want a dark black there's a couple ways. I don't know if you used a primer   If you did maybe more of a sticky base like ELF glitter glue would work. Or you can try and lay down a white base like NXY shadow pencil in Milk. That way when you put the color over it you're going to get a true color and it won't be so soft and blend out to grey as fast. But overall I like the look. You made it look much more wearable for daytime."

I used Smashbox 24 hr primer which I have had good results with in terms of staying, but I agree, using NYX milk underneath would probably help make it pop a bit more. You know, its funny. Before I got really into makeup, about 10 months ago, I picked up an NYX milk just because I was looking for a white eyeliner for my waterline. Little did I know it would be so multipurpose! I love this thing.    One of my coworkers said my makeup looked really ""fancy"" yesterday. I took that as meaning super over the top... so I dunno if I will be able to get away with another black eyeshadow look this week. We shall see... Maybe I can tone it down a bit more.    Thanks for your feedback!"
RandomActsofMakeup,3aqsqu,PeopleInMyHead,2,Tue Jun 23 16:21:25 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't think you need to tone it down for work. Unless you work at a place that's very conservative especially when it comes to clothes and makeup. Also I know NXY shadow pencil in Milk is HG status for me. There's so many uses for it. I actually depotted mine and I've gotten a crazy amount of uses out of it.
RandomActsofMakeup,3aqwzp,doctorwhore,2,Mon Jun 22 19:59:42 2015 UTC,"So these came last night at 9pm. I immediately went to put one on. It was #32 (I think) and it was the most perfect red. My sister said that it made my teeth look very white. So I played around in it for an hour, then washed my face. Still red. Brushed my teeth. Still red. Watched TV for 2 hours while drinking water. Still red. Slept for 8 hours. Still red. Took a shower. Still red. Brushed my teeth again. Still red. After 12 hours of wear, I removed it because it was freaking me out a bit.   It applies much like a liquid lipstick or a very opaque gloss. It feels and looks much like a gloss as you apply it, but it dries very matte. It took about 3 minutes to dry to its permanent state. It could take shorter or longer each time depending on how much you moisturize beforehand (and I REALLY suggest moisturizing) and how thick you layer it. It is QUITE thick, so (only if you are using the included applicator and not a lip brush) I’d suggest applying it to the center and inner parts of your lips and then applying it to the edge with whatever it left on the applicator.   It never stops being sticky. I waited an hour before I gave in and put powder on. My loose HD powder kinda clumped, but my translucent pressed powder worked great. I applied it with my finger because the single-ply tissue method just left me with tissue adhered to my lip. I also tried using chapstick over it, which basically just re-wet the lipstick and made it un-permanent. But I just waited for it to dry again.   I was a bit panicked over removal because it didn’t even come off when I washed my face in the shower. But then I remembered that my chapstick made it un-permanent the night before. So I applied a generous amount and wiped it away with a damp wash cloth. Easy. I just hope it washed off the cloth…  Bottom Line: Yes, I would recommend it. I’ve only ever used lip tar (hate it) and Stila Stay All Day Liquid Lipstick (like the consistency more than Me Now, but it doesn’t have the staying power), so I can’t comment on Lime Crime/Kat Von D/Anastasia Beverly Hills comparisons."
RandomActsofMakeup,3aqwzp,MyKindOfLullaby,2,Mon Jun 22 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"I'm going to try to wear one a day to get better swatches that are actually on lips. I'll keep this updated and then once I've done all 8, I'll make a swatches post. Wearing 33 today because I don't think I'm doing anything and I know I'm gonna look like a vampire.    4. 5. 9.

RandomActsofMakeup,3aqbmw,purpleandglitter,2,Mon Jun 22 19:53:49 2015 UTC,"Something like this would be good.   I also love using a single shadow (cream, like a color tattoo from Maybelline, or a powder-a Colour Pop single or a L'Oreal Infallible pigment), applied on the lid and then diffused out a bit as you get toward the crease. Something light, shimmery and neutral-a taupe, a cream/white, or a gold maybe.   Then just define the brows how you normally do, add mascara, and keep the face natural (your normal foundation/concealer, a matte blush, a MLBB lip color).   That's what I did for one of my most recent interviews anyway. Also, best of luck! :)"

I was so excited to meet her, because his happiness means the world to me. Met her for the first time when we invited them disc golfing, and I thought it went very well.  Well, turns out she absolutely HATES me. He texted me after and told me she said she never wants to see me again and has no interest in getting to know me. She was under the impression that I was competing for his attention and was an attention seeker. My fiance vouched that none of this was true.  This is so stupidly classic ""girl is jealous about boyfriend's girl best friend, throws fit"", that I want to puke."

I did a great face with some random stuff, went out to run my marvel rpg, and then it died in a fire of player drama. Like people yelling at each other while I sat back and watched my awesome world kinda die.  I had to MAKE myself take off my face when I got home. I liked that face. Blah. And none of the players even said a word about it tonight!  But hey, my cats are cuddly and even if I'm too bummed out to sleep I still have steam games and netflix.  Face-related stuff: what's a good facial moisturizer that's not my expensive benefit stuff? I've been rocking some regular lotion when I have a rest day and that's cool and all, but I'd like to explore some other options when my supply starts running low."

I'm looking to learn how to DM, and this is my worst nightmare.   As far as moisturizer, I like Supergoop!'s bb cream as it provides that much needed SPF, but it's not very moisturizing, so I use Ole Henriksen's moisturizer underneath. That can be pricey, but the small one has lasted me months and a little goes a long way. I also liked Sephora's Mattifying moisturizer, and it still has SPF! First Aid is really nice, and fairly inexpensive (but if you are a little oily, it might not help :( )."

She is extremely fair skinned and that type of shadow/liner is working well - literally looking like a shadow on her face - on your more tanned skin, it takes on a look of worn out makeup.   I would go with a shade that literally looks like a SHADOW on your face, like a golden brown. I would also in the tiniest way, line between your waterline and below, just where your lashes are  Also, I highly doubt those are her natural lashes, I would either get a really natural looking falsie or use a black mascara (which isnt showing up very well in the photos if you did use it)   And lastly, you and I both have the lovely gift of a smaller upper lip, so to really get her look, you need a strong shape with a little overlining. I know how hard it is to have a happy medium (that glorious place between pencil thin lip and circus clown). Maybe a brighter shade of lipstick would really offset the super neutral eye as well   Just my $0.02!!!"

They are a little pricey, however. The way I test to see if they match is blending a little on my cheek and seeing if it matches my skin tone. Make sure you test in different lighting, especially natural! My friend and I went to Sephora to get her a foundation. The makeup associate gave her a Lancome foundation and put some on her cheek. In the store lighting, it looked a TAD dark, but passable. She bought it for $36. When we went outside, I saw that it was WAY too orange for her. She took it back the next day and ended up having to go 6 shades lighter. Just be patient and take the time to test them out! No one wants orange face."

RandomActsofMakeup,3ad005,imlovingattention,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:09:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I used the Hourglass Matte Liquid Lipstick in Icon! /u/purpleandglitter sent me a mini to try :-) It's a super pretty and bold red colour but I dabbed it on my inner lips and blended it out with my fingers to create a ""watered down"" version."

RandomActsofMakeup,3ac6yi,bambikai,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:53:29 2015 UTC,Looks great.... the gold makes the black lipstick look much more wearable and less stark. Nice job!
RandomActsofMakeup,3ac6yi,samk19,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:41:56 2015 UTC,Thank you! Yeah I think sometimes a black lip tends to be (ironically) contrast-less... like no definition between top and bottom lip and kind of waters down the shape of your lips? I thought a highlight color might help.

Since you said CCW, I will say that I think you need to pull your mascara through more at the base of your lashes. Your tips are coated, but the base is looking a little neglected. Do you apply from the top? I know thats what helped me get better even coverage. Looking down and hitting the top a bit before switching back to the regular application style."

I always say these things and chicken out of posting.

San Paulo is my favorite but I also have Abu Dhabi, Monte Carlo, Tokyo, and a few that I forget the names.  I tried the stockholm because it looked so pretty on other girls but I went home and put it on and then drove right back to the store and returned it because it is the exact color of my skin and looked so, so bad. Abu Dhabi is closer to my natural lip color. I could talk about these lip colors all day- they are so nice and work perfectly for me."

RandomActsofMakeup,3a4cii,otter100,4,Wed Jun 17 03:17:36 2015 UTC,I really like Zoya and OPI! They come off easier. Always have a problem with any glitter polish though!
RandomActsofMakeup,3a4cii,To_each_their_0wn,3,Wed Jun 17 03:51:03 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, plus Essie!  Also make sure you are using 100% acetone, you may have to buy it at a beauty supply store. It dries out your cuticles, but it makes removing polish so easy."
RandomActsofMakeup,3a4cii,spiderblood,2,Wed Jun 17 07:12:52 2015 UTC,Seconding these comments. I've always had a really easy time getting opi and essie off.

RandomActsofMakeup,3a4cii,petunialou,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:55:12 2015 UTC,"seconding this, its fantastic!  also target has one--white jar, blue lid--that instead of a sponge inside the sides are lined with plastic bristles and this is ALSO amazing."
RandomActsofMakeup,3a4cii,violinkeri,2,Wed Jun 17 10:52:30 2015 UTC,Do you have to replace them or do they last forever or what?
RandomActsofMakeup,3a4cii,daryldickin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:07:53 2015 UTC,They are pretty durable! ive had a couple break bc im really rough with it and I have replaced the acetone a couple times since it gets grey and discolored but ive had it like a year and it still works great.  I found it looking for an alternative to the Sephora one because I always end up tearing the sponges.
RandomActsofMakeup,3a4cii,violinkeri,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:13:23 2015 UTC,Oh I'll have to look for the Target one!!
RandomActsofMakeup,3a4cii,petunialou,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:04:47 2015 UTC,Not so much brands but types. Cremes and frosts will come off easiest. Next is shimmers and flecked polishes. Glitter is the hardest to take off since polish glitter is solvent resistant. For very glittery polishes I use a peel off base coat (nail pattern boldness glitter a peel). Picture Polish just came out with one too... though I am still experimenting to see how it cooperates best with my body chemistry and polishes.
RandomActsofMakeup,3a4cii,CrossedWires,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:15:01 2015 UTC,Use a base coat and your polish.  Sinful colors are awesome!  And inexpensive. Use pure acetone nail polish remover when removing

RandomActsofMakeup,3a0lp6,Fancylogic,2,Tue Jun 16 08:02:20 2015 UTC,I want to get some foundation and concealer. I was reading MUA about it and primer was suggested. I have acne and redness and scars left from old acne I want to cover up but I also have dark circles I want to cover up as well. Two different colors were suggested so I dunno what to do. Suggestions?
RandomActsofMakeup,3a0lp6,Mrs_C_W,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:32:28 2015 UTC,I would get a full coverage foundation and a lighter concealer for under eyes to brighten it up. I can't help with primer. But full coverage should be able to hide what you want covered. You can also get a high coverage concealer to spot cover. Ive heard good things about the Naked concealers.
RandomActsofMakeup,3a0lp6,dinoegg,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:00:45 2015 UTC,"Someone, please tell me I didn't create something amazing.

RandomActsofMakeup,3a095e,exclamationmarkk,3,Tue Jun 16 05:26:32 2015 UTC,"You have a great natural brow to work with! (Jealous.) I do not think you need to do anything dramatic to really update your look. If you want an at-home solution, I would just pluck the stray hairs that you can see along your brow bone. Anything that looks out of the uniform shape of your brow can go and it will look like a much cleaner line."
RandomActsofMakeup,3a095e,unclefuckerImustsay,3,Tue Jun 16 05:44:06 2015 UTC,"Your eyebrows look great! I think thick brows definitely suit you :)  If you have any interest in getting them done by a professional, I had a great experience at the Benefit Brow Bar. The lady who did mine pretty much just asked if I wanted to make them much thinner (I didn't) and then cleaned them up for me! I'm quite a beginner too and while plucking strays has always worked pretty well for me, I definitely felt better having them done by a professional. I think it's a bit pricier than some other places, but I've heard nothing but good things about them.   If you want any product recommendations, I use L'Oréal Brow Stylist Plumper Brow Mascara when I want something on my brows. It's very reasonably priced and almost impossible to mess up. :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,3a095e,Lolla-Lee-Lou,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:14:47 2015 UTC,"I absolutely want to echo the recommendation to go to a Benefit Brow Bar if you have one nearby. They're in many Ulta locations, and they have standalone locations in the west coast. Also, Anastasia Brow Bars are good if you have one of those nearby, but I prefer Benefit. They'll completely map your brows, making sure they start, arch, and end where they should, and will fill them in heavily for you so you can see what the end shape will be (don't worry they don't leave them that dark it's just for demonstration purposes). Once you approve the shape, because they'll definitely keep them as thick/thin and archy/straight as you want, they'll wax or pluck your brows, whatever you prefer. Waxing hurts way less. You will be blown away with how amazing your brows look when they're done. They work magic, and you have an amazing shape to start with, so it will be easy for them to make your brows look awesome :) Alternatively, if you don't have any of those options, on the Benefit website there are tutorials on how to map your brows with videos and everything. You can follow those to get your basic shape then clean up underneath your brows to achieve that shape. Don't pluck too much above your brows because they look like they really don't need it ither than maybe getting an errant hair or two. Please don't get your brows threaded. I've seen and heard too many horror stories to ever recommend threading. Some people get lucky, but it's not worth the risk."
RandomActsofMakeup,3a095e,SmartAleck08,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:04:44 2015 UTC,I would keep them thick but wax or pluck the stray hairs. You have a nice brow shape that you could fill in a little bit for some definition and it would look great.

RandomActsofMakeup,39xhur,kaorte,3,Mon Jun 15 16:33:08 2015 UTC,"Can5t really see the contour since the picture is angled up. I would suggest using either a tinted brow mascara or putting some color in there using a shadow. Your hair is really dark but your brows are so light. Mine do that too. If you want to experiment without dropping a ton on new products, of you have a brown eye shadow, use that and an angled brush and put the clear gel on top to set it. I did that for years before actually buying brow products and it honestly worked the same. Other than that, the look is very pretty. Love the eye shadow!"

RandomActsofMakeup,39uurz,cheakie,7,Sun Jun 14 23:57:19 2015 UTC,Honestly I love it. It takes some practice but I can go for a light look or full on power brow depending on my mood. I'm generally a bit cheap but I think it's an awesome value. I've been using it daily for almost a year and I'm only about half way through it.   A couple tips: Oil based cleansers are great for removing it. I like target brand gentle eye makeup remover best.   If you have an oily forehead try putting a little eyeshadow primer on the area around your brows to extend the wear time.   After awhile it starts to lose its creamy texture. Don't despair! Just stir it up and smooth the surface back out. Good as new!

RandomActsofMakeup,39uurz,suavisactiojackson,3,Mon Jun 15 05:06:00 2015 UTC,"I love it! I'm pretty inexperienced with brow products and tried it based upon the suggestions from this sub. I got a sample at sephora first and tried it out for a bit before buying. I thought it was quite easy to use as a beginger that could be very natural looking but also could be more 'in your face' brows if thats what you wanted. I haven't had any problem with it stayng but I also never retouch my makeup, so other reviews might be better to know that."
RandomActsofMakeup,39uurz,CrashBurnLove,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:44:41 2015 UTC,Did you just ask for a sample of it? I always forget to ask about samples when I'm at sephora.
RandomActsofMakeup,39uurz,MissBazinga,2,Mon Jun 15 21:06:05 2015 UTC,"I have a sample of it that I got in January that I've been using near-daily ever since and I still have a ton left. I LOVE it, and will definitely be purchasing it once my sample runs out...IF it ever runs out! I use an extremely light hand with it and I get very natural looking brows with it, which I love because I also have a bald spot on my right eyebrow that it covers almost effortlessly. As far as wear time, this stuff doesn't budge unless you want it to! I know it's bad, but when I work late I'll often fall asleep without taking my makeup off. In the morning, most of my other makeup will be smudged or long gone, but my brows will still be perfect!"

RandomActsofMakeup,39uurz,L3aBoB3a,2,Tue Jun 16 07:13:43 2015 UTC,"I like it because it has the best staying power of all the products I've used. I have pretty oily skin, so most products kind of slide off eventually. I don't, however, use it much because it takes more time than I'm willing to spend these days. I usually end up using a pencil because I don't spend as much time out of the house as I used to, so my makeup doesn't need to last all day like it did when I was working."

RandomActsofMakeup,39tf47,srs5222,3,Sun Jun 14 16:30:38 2015 UTC,"You're probably applying it in a ""fan"" shape (darkest at the corners, blended). This is an easy-to-follow list by Makeup Geek, detailing different eyeshadow application shapes.   I have slightly hooded eyes/demi lids. When I do a shadow look, I don't use much metallics, because they make the fake crease I do apparent. I love glittery things, though, so a way to use shiny shadow (for me) is to use it as eyeliner. I dampen a brush and apply it in a winged shape.  The inner portion in this look is the copper shadow from the Milani Bella Eyes line, and the outer wing is the dark brown from WnW's comfort zone. That's all the shadow I'm wearing. (Apologies for my brows, I hadn't gotten them done yet.)"

RandomActsofMakeup,39tf47,Flapperinthestars,3,Mon Jun 22 12:30:16 2015 UTC,I love bright eye looks because I have glasses. I usually end up doing  a fan shape with the crease color brought the whole way in. I usually do this with yellow/orange/red/burgundy or blue/teal/green/yellow. I change the placement of the colors sometimes using yellow on the main part of my lid instead of my usual orange.    One thing that I found that can make a significant difference in the overall tone of your look is eyeliner. If I bring my liquid eyeliner to the very inner corner it makes everything look more edgy.   I've also been testing out different transition and base shades. If I'm doing a cool toned look I might switch it up with a warm brown transition/crease color to add some contrast.

RandomActsofMakeup,39tf47,palette_,3,Mon Jun 22 12:30:24 2015 UTC,"I am current experimenting with duochromes.. and you should too! They're awesome, because they make it seem like you put more work into the color than you did. You can make beautiful one shadow looks (credit to /u/niftynonsense) or you can combine it with a few other shadows to make it work (credit to /u/benoit_balls).  And it's like buying 2 eyeshadows for the price of one! Plus most indie companies offer sample baggies, so you can find what does and doesn't work on you."

RandomActsofMakeup,39tf47,ladyboss_1,3,Mon Jun 22 12:30:31 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm constantly in an eyeshadow rut. I do the same shapes every time I apply makeup, just using a different color scheme. I guess a similar problem to you.  Something I've been experimenting with lately is using a single color only. I really love how simple and clean it comes out looking. Today, for example, I used my contour powder in the crease only and it came out looking natural and different from the halo-eye-type look I usually go for. Something I've been wanting to try is a bronzey eye like this one. I don't have a color like that though, so I'll have to keep an eye out. If anyone has any recommendations for a nice shimmery bronze eyeshadow, that would be great."

Just my little suggestion if you don't want to wear liquid eyeliner but still want to make your eyes pop, try using a pencil eyeliner and tightlining. You can also use a darker color on the top water line and either a nude or a white on the bottom to really open them up. I'm not a professional just an enthusiast. Also I love seeing battle stations and how people organize because mine is seriously a mess right now."

So I went and bought a bottle of their plain black polish, but was pretty disappointed in it....it didn't seem any better than the cheaper brands of black polish I had. So I don't personally think it's worth the $15 and just stick to cheaper brands. I love their packaging though."
RandomActsofMakeup,39e779,qu1ckbeam,2,Thu Jun 11 05:35:52 2015 UTC,"To be fair, certain colours are a shitshow to buy from any brand (white, yellow, black).  Sally Hansen came out with a black one-coater Insta Dry polish recently when they expanded their product line, I wish they had also re-released OMGhost, their white one-coater from Halloween, under a new name."

It's one of the few that I can watch over and over again and still be entertained.   As for CC the only thing I would add would be some more definition to the lower lash line. A soft shadow blended a light brown eyeliner smudged or even just a few coats of mascara on your lower lash line. I think with this dramatic of a look your lower lash line gets kind of lost into the rest of your face a bit.   I am jealous of your blending skills. :)"

Absolutely thrilled me, especially since this was when I first started wearing bold lip colors.  I seem to get that reaction a lot when I wear bright pink lipsticks. I also had a girl at the Empire State Building stop me to find out what color I was wearing because she liked it so much. That was Bite's Corvina.   ...this is making me realize I should wear bright pink lipsticks more often. Anyway, having random women stop you to compliment your makeup is an amazing feeling."

I was over at a friend's house with some other girls when they started asking me to do their makeup because they liked mine so much.

Now, I'm not a natural makeup person in the first place. Complete nu-goth girl here, but my makeup has never been harsh lines and unblended or cakey. I learned from watching drag queens on YouTube actually and when I finally go the hang of it, almost instantly, I got compliments from former co-workers and random customers at my former job in retail. I'm a very big fan of matte everything. Nails, lipstick, foundation, eyeshadow. I remember once on another subreddit last year, I got a lot of compliments from users for my blending with my eyeshadow and it made me feel pretty great because I have a very opaque black matte eyeshadow that I wear constantly that takes about twenty minutes to blend so it was nice to know my efforts don't go wasted haha."

It's in my field and well paying and still near Portland and this is basically a best-case scenario as a recent BA grad  Con: I'm spending my first week doing safety quizzes and reading msds sheets and that coupled with a commute that requires early mornings is the MOST TEDIOUS AND EXHAUSTING I JUST WANT TO PLAY WITH CHEMICALS
RandomActsofMakeup,397ghl,cowbundles,2,Tue Jun 9 20:21:09 2015 UTC,Ok. I need to ask. What's so great about Lush? I constantly walk into the one at my local shopping centre and always kinda get turned off whenever I go in...not to mention the price..
RandomActsofMakeup,397ghl,thelostwhore,3,Tue Jun 9 22:14:34 2015 UTC,"What they stand for, their ingredients, the quirky products are all very unique. But then again I used to work there so I'm a babybit biased."
RandomActsofMakeup,397ghl,kitterkatzen,4,Tue Jun 9 23:16:53 2015 UTC,"I never understood why people were obsessed either, until I went in and bought myself a few things (tea tree toner, solid shampoo, face mask). It was like a magic elixir for my face and hair, and I'll never turn back."

RandomActsofMakeup,397ghl,thelostwhore,2,Wed Jun 10 05:08:23 2015 UTC,I love the solid shampoos.  I am currently using Lullaby about every 7 -10 day as I am mostly no poo.  It really leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I am also using full of grace solid serum and it's amazing on my face at night.  My skin is glowing.   I want to try the honey I washed my hair next.

I'm in love. Both are great for my sensitive dry skin. The Oatifix smells like the Pillsbury Doughboy vomited on my face. I love it! Only downside: they expire after 21 days, and they need to be kept in the fridge until then. Honestly, I don't mind.   EDIT: The shampoo bars are amazing! I really didn't expect the lather to be fabulous, but, wow. I really recommend these. My hair is so fluffy and bouncy. My waves are on point! <3"

RandomActsofMakeup,397ghl,creativexangst,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:03:28 2015 UTC,"I have longish thick curly hair and I wash it daily to every other day, and my bars last me at least a month, usually about 6 weeks. The trick is to suds up your scalp and then bring the suds down the length of your hair (so after you get your scalp, put the bar down!) You might need to get a little more soap at the ends of your hair with your length but that should do it. Also, make sure you put your bar in a place that it's not in the direct stream of water so it can dry out, otherwise you're just wasting shampoo :D"
RandomActsofMakeup,397ghl,Mrs_C_W,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:21:38 2015 UTC,oo! yay. How are the shampoo bars for dry hair? Mine is naturally curly and needs moisture constantly.
RandomActsofMakeup,397ghl,creativexangst,2,Wed Jun 10 05:51:45 2015 UTC,"I'm a curly too! I have tried a lot of the new bars, and Jason and the Argan Oil tends to be recommended a lot but it didn't work well for me (plus it constantly feels like wet velvet, bleh). In general they all provide great moisture, I particularly like Godiva, Lullaby and Soak and Float. Godiva is very fragrant and very moisturizing, lullaby is soothing and gentle, and soak and float is people's most hated smell usually haha, it smells like a campfire, but it's a miracle on itchy, dandruff/psorisis ridden scalp. It rids my flakes completely and keeps them away, all while not affecting any of my allergy triggers."

I use squeaky green and it makes my hair feel fantastic (very thick, wavy, out of control hair with lots of frizz)! I'm going to try seanik next time. I've tried their coconut one and one with conditioner in it but they didn't work well for me."

RandomActsofMakeup,397ghl,unclefuckerImustsay,2,Tue Jun 9 21:23:39 2015 UTC,Lush employee here :) I love the shampoo bars! If you're looking for moisture try out Braziliant (Orange) Jason and the Argan Oil (rose and Argan) Godiva (jasmine and cocoa butter) or Honey I Washed my Hair (honey) :)))
RandomActsofMakeup,397ghl,Helenarth,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:12:06 2015 UTC,Oh my god that is way too many choices! Haha! ;) Any particular recommendation for thick/wavy hair that I wash twice a week and is most often heat treated with blow dryer and flat iron?
RandomActsofMakeup,397ghl,unclefuckerImustsay,2,Tue Jun 9 23:25:38 2015 UTC,Jason and the Argan oil or Braziliant :) Jason has Argan oil and Braziliant has andirons oil so they're both nourishing and Braziliant was invented for curly/wavy hair. Also definitely try our R&B leave in moisturizer. I always use it before I blow dry.
RandomActsofMakeup,397ghl,skelezombie,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:24:48 2015 UTC,"I saw the leave in last time I was there and wanted to give it a try! I will have to add those to my list. Though, let's face it, most of the damn store is on my list ;)"
RandomActsofMakeup,397ghl,blassy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:29:25 2015 UTC,"I've used the Godiva one, it's great for dry hair - it has chunks of conditioner in. Smells reaaaally strong though, don't use it if you don't like jasmine lol. I would recommend breaking/cutting chunks to bring with you into the shower otherwise as it can get a bit melty with heat and humidity."

I used to use drugstore exclusively and while the drugstore has many good items, there are certain things I like to spend a little more money on.

I haven't tried much from NYX because a lot (jumbo pencils, for eyes and lips) have to be sharpened. I love Wet n Wild eyeshadow!  I have been in Sephora and Ulta, but I haven't bought any makeup. Lame, I know. The last time I went to Ulta, the sales associates were really trying to get me to buy something from Benefit, but I didn't want to blind-buy (I always read reviews first). ...I think I ended up buying a random nail polish?"
RandomActsofMakeup,396vye,caution_wet_taint,2,Tue Jun 9 18:41:04 2015 UTC,Revlon does make some badass lippies. Favorite one?   I have noticed that with Ulta the sales associates are either really standoffish or really pushy. At least the ones I've been in.

Instead of trying to make yourself do a new look today maybe you can do a facial/mud mask or if you don't have anything like that you can put some cold cucumbers or tea bags on your eyes and lay down and relax. Also one last thing, I'm sure you told the store what happened, but make sure they check security footage from when your purse was taken. It might be someone who goes in there regularly and causes problems so maybe they can find out who did it. I really hope your day turns around. I'm giving you an internet hug right now."

I ordered it in February and in April I was told I would receive a refund. Finally, today I told them that I was going to contact my credit card company to have them cancel the charge and I was told they would never honor a ""false claim"" even though I had saved me emails from them acknowledging that I never received my lipstick!

I was scheduled to work yesterday afternoon (keep in mind they changed their mind and asked me to come in at 11 which was impossible) and had been doing some updates for software on my phone. The time neared closer to my shift but the damn updates kept coming so I waited until the last possible minute and had to unplug it (my phone is necessary for my job) and it's been stuck on some screen since yesterday saying that software update failed. I've tried everything and it's borked. They're sending me a replacement on Tuesday which I paid $16 for overnight shipping and without that it would get here on Wednesday which makes it all ridiculous.  On top of that, the clock on my car is broken and would be CRAZY expensive to fix since they'd have to replace the entire unit so I keep putting the wrong times on my orders.  :( Sorry for the rant, I just needed to let out my demons."

It's tiered, and each of the front three sections holds 5 MAC lipsticks, the second tier has 3 sections that hold 2 MAC lipsticks, and the back row has two sections that can hold 3 MAC lipsticks each but they're too tall so I use them for lip and eye pencils."

RandomActsofMakeup,38q15a,Zannahquinn,2,Fri Jun 5 21:28:41 2015 UTC,"I LOVE the Lancôme hypnose mascaras! I'm using the original at the moment but hypnose drama is great for a fuller night out look (although I find it gets a bit clumpy in the tube after a while), hypnose doll eyes is great for an every day open eyed longer lash look and I think hypnose star is a mix of all 3 (not sure if anyone can clarify?). I'm never sure which I like best so I tend to change it up each time but of all the mascaras I have tried it is my fave and I get so many comments! I know different brands and types suit different lashes so just so you know my lashes are dark, double row, long and curly so I'm not sure how they fare on lighter straighter lashes.  Also about 18 months ago I started using the Lancôme teint idole ultra 24h foundation as I am very pale and had been using clarins and found out Lancôme do 3 shades lighter! I use 005 (I think) and I like a medium to full coverage and I am so happy with it. I recently added the Lancôme concealer to go with it which I use for blemish coverage and again I'm very happy with it!  Lastly I had a bottle of la vie est belle perfume which I liked (I didn't love it as I am more citrusey inclined) but I did go through a 50ml bottle and enjoyed it and I have never had so many people comment on a perfume as that one.  So I guess that's my 2 cents! Sorry it's so long, I think for good basics Lancôme is definitely my favourite brand!   I have also recently tried their skincare but only in an anti aging serum and I didn't particularly think it did anything. Enjoy your shopping spree.....there's a chance I may be a tiny bit jealous! ;-)"

It's so cool and soft, it feels so nice on my face and saves my hands from getting covered in foundation and concealer and just makes everything look so amazing.  I also love putting my highlight on, I go crazy on my Cupid's now since everything wears off quickly there on me.   I think what I currently look forward to most is setting my under eyes.  Concealer and my apparently genetic (they never go away) dark circles that are blacker than a black hole and just suck all of my product into their ashy, cakey, separated abyss have never gotten along.  I've tried lots of different brands and formulas, color corrector, primer, setting powder, my beauty blender, etc.  Even if I could get it applied decently, it would cake and settle into my fine lines and just look terrible within an hour or two.  Until now.  I can't remember whose technique this is to give credit, but I read about it on /r/makeupaddiction a couple times and figured it couldn't hurt to try.  You apply your primer, corrector, concealer, etc. as usual.  Then, instead of just lightly dusting with setting powder, you pay (with the end of your brush, don't swipe or blend in any way) enough metric fucktons of your favorite finely milled setting powder for a wedding cake over top of your concealer and let it ""bake"" (read:set) for five minutes or so while you're finishing other things up.  Then, you dust it off and buff what's left in with a fluffy powder brush and shed a single tear (that won't even ruin your fresh makeup because you also just set, transfer proofed, and probably damn near water proofed it) at the beauty that is your under eye area.  And then you do it again four hours later, and eight hours later,  when you realize it is still perfect.  Mmmmmmmm.    Setting spray is my least favorite part, it takes my breath.  ):"

My shoulders and hands are pretty olive/tad bit yellow undertone but my neck (underneath my chin and close to my ears where I don't have vitiligo) is pretty neutral warm. So, what should I match? I don't want to look warm on the face but my hands another color. Does this make sense?    Foundation: L'Oreal True Match Lumi Healthy Luminous Makeup in Buff Beige.

RandomActsofMakeup,38lpd4,looumaaa,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:48:51 2015 UTC,"I have only tried DUO lash glue (in clear and black), Ardell Lash Grip (clear), and Revlon Precision lash adhesive (in clear and black).  Personally I like the Revlon one the best.  It comes in a tube with a wand brush applicator, and the clear one looks like it has a bluish tint when you brush it on the band before it dries clear. (Plus, it's only like $4-5 at Walmart!)  My general tips are:   taking the lash and wiggling the band in a U a bit to loosen/make less 'stiff' hold it to your eye to see if it is a good length (and cutting to fit) apply the glue on the band (with a little dab extra on the ends) and wait ~30 seconds to let the glue get tacky before setting use your fingers, tweezers, or things like these (cheaper on ebay/amazon) to help set them close to but not on your lashes cut the lash into 2-3 pieces if it's too hard for you to do it all at once apply eyeliner before setting lashes and after above the band  optional, use mascara to blend real and false lashes together, but it makes it more of a pain to clean if you plan on reusing them a lot don't forget to tightline!"

My husband was attacked by a dog when he was little and he never received the reconstructive surgery he should have had on his face (it's a long story that makes me angry). So now he's left with a couple of good size scars under his right eye and on the left side of his face going down his chin. Basically where the dog bit down. So we're always looking for something to lessen the texture and pigmentation because they get irritated by shaving and sun exposure.

By drawing me creepy little pictures and hiding them in my makeup area.   http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/22800000/Tim-s-Love-Pictures-helena-bonham-carter-tim-burton-22845669-489-427.jpg

RandomActsofMakeup,38exu0,KennedyDrew,10,Wed Jun 3 19:38:22 2015 UTC,"Try using a lighter hand on the purple and blending it out thoroughly to smooth those edges out.  Your eyebrows are pretty heavy, too, and they throw off the ""balance"" for me (strong lip, strong eye, strong brow)- dipbrow has a serious learning curve, the teeniest little bit can still create a killer ""power brow"".  Also, did you overdraw your bottom lip? It looks kind of exaggerated, and from the angle the pictures are taken, is a bit jarring.    Will say- your eyeliner game is definitely on point!"
RandomActsofMakeup,38exu0,unfunnypun,0,Thu Jun 4 00:05:29 2015 UTC,"My normal brow is a lot less than this, I was going crazy on all point for this and yes my lip is overdrawn"
RandomActsofMakeup,38exu0,tobaya12,4,Thu Jun 4 00:59:13 2015 UTC,I would take a slightly lighter shade of purple or a neutral shadow to blend out the edges of your eyeshadow. You have a lot of canvas space so don't be afraid to use it! The blending should help to make it look a little more polished.
RandomActsofMakeup,38exu0,wake_and_vape,3,Wed Jun 3 22:51:22 2015 UTC,"I think you brought the purple too close to your eyebrows, as others have said.  Especially near the ends.  I think the purple works great with your eye color,  but with the brows and the overdrawn lips it's a little much.  Try lightening your hand towards the inner brow so it looks a bit more believable."
RandomActsofMakeup,38exu0,missbologna,2,Thu Jun 4 02:00:16 2015 UTC,I can totally see what you mean lol I had just finished watching the Rupauls Drag Race season finale so you can see where the inspiration comes from haha

RandomActsofMakeup,38exu0,stacy_winters,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:39:35 2015 UTC,"I love seeing people play with color like this! I agree with what's been said, try blending out that purple a bit more to soften the edge. I find that blending the edge also make it look like my hand was steadier so the little bumps and imperfectly covered spots aren't so noticeable. That brow is very thick, I would tone it down a bit for a look that's focused on color! Sometimes when I'm just playing around with my brighter colors (and I don't need to be anywhere professional) I fill in either the ends of my brows or the whole things with a bright color to match my look! That could be a fun way to mix things up."

RandomActsofMakeup,38be62,Mrs_C_W,3,Wed Jun 3 05:18:46 2015 UTC,My time to shine.   My go to foundation is the match perfection foundation. I have dry skin and it works great as a buildable medium coverage foundation. I highly recommend it.   I also have the match perfection concealer. I like it. Its better than my last one but it needs to be blended quickly as it dries fast on me.  Its a good every day concealer.   I have 3 Kate Moss lipsticks. 2 matte 1 not.   The 104 is my favorite. Its almost neutral on me. MLBB lipstick. Its perfection.  The 107 is a sexy red. Its not Taylor Swift red but deeper. I like it because it makes me feel fancy. People who wear red daily I recommend it.  I recently got 33(?) i have to check. It is a Barbie pink. The coverage isnt as smooth and it takes more layers but I bought it so I use it. Its super girly to me.

RandomActsofMakeup,38be62,Mrs_C_W,2,Thu Jun 4 16:27:19 2015 UTC,Liquid! I've never tried the powder. Or any powder foundation actually.
RandomActsofMakeup,38be62,FaytheReyn,2,Thu Jun 4 17:09:36 2015 UTC,"Does it leave a dewy finish, a matte one, or something in between?"
RandomActsofMakeup,38be62,Mrs_C_W,2,Thu Jun 4 17:26:24 2015 UTC,I'd say in between. It comes across very natural on me. I would say it leans more dewy though. It's recommended to use a powder to set (isn't that standard anyhow? I'm too lazy and it last for me).
RandomActsofMakeup,38be62,Asiastana,2,Thu Jun 4 18:01:20 2015 UTC,"Lol! :-) I have a mattifying powder that I love, so I'll just use that. :-) Thanks to you, I'm picking some up tomorrow to try (payday, yay!)"

RandomActsofMakeup,38be62,whythehecknot,3,Wed Jun 3 05:15:18 2015 UTC,"Rimmel is hands-down my favourite high street/drug store brand. I use the Match Foundation, it's my favourite foundation so far. The coverage is even, and can be built up without looking cakey.  I use the Wake Me Up concealer for the undereyes - I really like how light it is, I find it doesn't settle into lines. I also have the Match Perfect concealer, which I mostly use on blemishes. I actually only bought it because I had an impromptu sleepover at a friend's house after a party (oops) and had plans for the next morning. I looked like death, my under eyes were basically purple and I had a zillion red bumps on my face courtesy of not removing my makeup the night before... It wasn't as great as the Wake Me Up concealer for undereyes, I found it a bit too creamy, but it was great on blemishes.  The Stay Matte powder is my HG, I find that the translucent one seems to leave a bit of a white cast, but I normally use Sandstorm and it's great.  The Stay Matte primer seems really good. This is only the second primer I've tried, so I haven't got much to compare it to, but compared to Nivea Daily Essentials it seems to be really hardcore. I normally have an issue with foundation sliding off my face when it's hot, but it does not budge with this primer. It does make my face feel a bit suffocated if I use it with a heavy moisturiser though. And it will make dry flakes more noticeable.  Their Scandaleyes liner in the beige colour is really nice for the lower waterline.  I also own a couple of lip and eye products, including some Kate Moss lipsticks, and some nail varnishes. Overall I find Rimmel to be a really dependable brand."
RandomActsofMakeup,38be62,Missdeborah,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:00:29 2015 UTC,UGH I want the Wake Me Up concealer but I swear it's only sold in the UK cause I cannot find it here.
RandomActsofMakeup,38be62,BludMuffin,3,Fri Jun 5 02:08:12 2015 UTC,"I hate that the color range for Rimmel's foundations is so limited.  I bought the darkest shade of the Stay Matte foundation and it was still too light for me (NC42).    That said, I like their Kate Moss matte lipsticks in 104 and 111, ScandalEyes eyeliners in Nude and Taupe, ScandalEyes Shadow Sticks (all colors), ScandalEyes Shadow Paints (all colors), Stay Matte primer, and Stay Matte translucent powder.  I wanted to love the Apocalips/Show Off Lip Lacquers and Matte Lip Velvets, but they just transfer way too much for my liking.  I haven't ever seen any cheek products in my area, but I want to try them."
RandomActsofMakeup,38be62,XSTall,2,Wed Jun 3 20:13:41 2015 UTC,"I swear by their pencil eyeliners. So smooth and pigmented. I love a lot of the things they have. They were my first primer (worked okay, but I'm UBER oily, so it wasn't the best best), and I probably have about one of each of everything. Everything is above average in my opinion except one thing. I can't remember the name of the color but its a kate moss lipstick and it was my very first nude. I was so excited when I got it, I applied it before I left for work and by the time I got to work it was gone (like, a 10 minute drive). I was soooo disappointed."
RandomActsofMakeup,38be62,unfunnypun,2,Wed Jun 3 04:48:27 2015 UTC,"I got one of their eyeliners in an Influenster box once and it is seriously the best eyeliner I've ever used. Comparable to, if not better than UD!"

It's just not a brand I think about or get excited to try. I haven't purchased anything from the line in years.  I didn't like:   Scandaleyes Lycra Flex Mascara - It was clumpy and spidery. Exaggerate Auto Waterproof Eye Definer in Ripe Plum - I couldn't get any color to show up on my eyes. Lasting Finish Lipstick in Crush - I wanted a nice coral, but this was too shimmery.   I did like:   Wonder'full Mascara (Wonder'lash in the U.S.) - It was nice and natural, but I'd need the waterproof version because regular mascaras always run on me. Stay Matte Powders - I haven't used these in years. When I did use it, I liked it. Lasting Finish Lipstick in Airy Fairy - I liked it the one time I wore it before it went through the washer and dryer. Lasting Finish Blush in Pink Sorbet - These are now the Mono blushes and Pink Sorbet has been discontinued. It's a nice, blendable pink."

And she's like the most sexy human being out there, so we've got that going for us.   I like to blow out the eyeshadow on my lower lashline to compensate. I often use burgundy-like colors for this, I absolutely love this look and it even looks great without eyeliner (which I hate).   What is on your wish list right now?"
RandomActsofMakeup,389j3i,To_each_their_0wn,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:59:20 2015 UTC,"I did not know that! She is hot!!   gah I always worry about giving myself racoon eyes since I already am cursed with dark under eyes. I guess I should try and be more adventurous with the eye makeup. I've only left my comfort zone a handful of times... lol  Well I've started adding stuff to my amazon wishlist, but I'm mostly interested in cheaper drug store makeup. I'm not made of money and I'm not expert enough to justify spending so much $$$ on makeup. The most expensive thing I have is Vice 3 which I got using a gift card (woo!). I use that palette almost everyday. I guess what I do want to get is some bronzer & contour as I have like none. I have a lot of eyeshadow colors right now... but I am always tempted to get more for some reason lol."

Her makeup artist is amazing, she's always rocking an intense inner corner highlight which I dig. I think you've done a great job on your eyeshadow btw.   Oh don't worry, I'm all about drug store products too. I have like 3 or 4 mid-end items and one high end for my brows and all the rest is cheap. I find that they are more often a hit or miss but there's really great stuff out there! You can experiment with it and not have to feel bad afterwards about spending $30 on a lipstick that didn't even work out for you."

RandomActsofMakeup,3839ve,Sixkitties,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:38:57 2015 UTC,Elf Smudgepot on top of wet n wild fergie eyeshadow primer is the absolute best base I've found for smokey looks. I can literally sleep in my makeup and have my eyeshadow look perfect in the morning.

RandomActsofMakeup,3839ve,Raewynrh,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:49:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure! I should probably start with basics: good foundation, neutral eye shadows, and a good every day lip color. My main concern is that I've never been big on foundation, live in a humid area, and don't want to look like it's plastered on! But I want to even out the redness is my skintone and cover some blemishes."
RandomActsofMakeup,3839ve,kaeladedah,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:55:27 2015 UTC,It's really hot and humid here too. I've been skipping liquid foundation on days I'll be out a lot in favor of a powdered mineral foundation. Ulta makes one that lasts all day on me. Even if I'm sweating a lot I can see it come off with makeup remover at the end of the day.

RandomActsofMakeup,3839ve,caution_wet_taint,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:11:17 2015 UTC,I like gel liners but for learning I would suggest Club Clio waterproof BRUSH tip eyeliner. It's like $14 on Amazon and comes with a mascara or cleansing oil. It's a perfect dupe for Kat Von D tattoo liner and I  can get super sharp wings with it.

Lilies. I had them in my wedding bouquet and my husband sent me a huge arrangement on my birthday once when he was deployed. Thinking of getting a lily tattoo. What is your favorite color? Blue. More specifically teal/turquoise  What is your favorite scent? Fresh peaches and strawberries. If i could live in that smell I would. What is/was your major in college? (If you didn't/haven't gone what would you major in?) I've always wanted to go to school to become an esthetician.  What is your favorite song of the moment? Get It by Run the Jewels. I've been listening to it before work every morning and it pumps me up. What is your favorite makeup item you own? Urban Decay Naked Skin in .5 - I just ran out and I can't foot the price tag. Definitely a rebuy later.  What is your favorite animal? I love owls. And Capuchin monkeys. So cute.  What other languages do you know besides English? I did not retain mucho from clase de espanol What is your favorite fruit? Peaches, strawberries and pineapple. And I do enjoy a good kiwi now and again. Do you like indie makeup brands? I've never tried them honestly. I have been eyeing some things from Geek Chic.  What is a makeup item you are lusting after? My very own Inglot palette. I LOVE eyeshadow and it's been on my wishlist for a good 3 years now.  Do you have any big plans for the summer? No :( My biggest plans include taking my boys to the lake this summer and just having outdoor fun. I work a lot and I'm trying to work up to a manager position for a better paycheck :) What is your favorite ice cream flavor? Ben & Jerry Phish Food Who is your favorite fictional character? Arya Stark. She is such a little badass and she's my favorite part of Game of Thrones/Song of Ice and Fire series. What is a makeup item you never use? Bronzer. I haven't perfected it yet. I'm super pale so I end up looking dirty/orange. I need to practice. A lot."

It doesn't quite match me and I don't really wear foundation. I am not at home at the moment but when I get back I can take pics and I could give you a deal on it if you are interested. :) Yisss owls. I want an owl. Si, esponal es un poco dificil. :) I have not branced into Geek Chic, but I want to! Do you want a bronze glow or to contour with bronzer?   Thanks so much for entering!"
RandomActsofMakeup,37uaur,caution_wet_taint,2,Sun May 31 13:40:58 2015 UTC,Makeup is so much fun so collecting is very easy to do. I recently went through my purse and found eleven lip products. Eleven.   I think what intimidates me about indies is that a lot of them are loose shadows and that kind of scares me a bit lol. I'm not sure how to go about using them without making a huge mess.   Might be interested in some Naked Skin. It did wonders for my skin and it didn't feel heavy.   With bronzer I was trying both. I just haven't gotten the hang of adding a glow or contouring. I have Milk Chocolate Soleil and I put it in the back of my drawer because I end up looking like I have dirt smeared on my face. I'll just have to drag it out and play with it some more.
RandomActsofMakeup,37uaur,caution_wet_taint,1 point,Sun May 31 23:53:36 2015 UTC,I use standard eyehsadow brushes and a good primer with a gentle hand. I pat the shadow on then spread it out. :) It is odd at first but not too hard. I find I really like it.  I'll take pics when I get home. :)  Remember that conturing recedes an area higlighting brings it out.  You want to color to match your skin undertones. If you pale like me I reccomend nyx taupe or a coolish grey bronze. Figure out your face and why you want to contur/highlight. :)
RandomActsofMakeup,37uaur,lillyandletters,2,Mon Jun 1 00:45:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you :) I think I still have placement wrong on my face which makes it look weird. I need to just play around with it while I binge watch Rupaul's Drag Race.   Now when you say you spread it out, are you talking about standard blending motions to make lines not as harsh? Or to move the color around to cover more area? (Sorry for all the questions.)"

Hopefully I have this all formatted right. 1. What is your favorite flower? Lilies of all kinds, but sadly I am allergic to them. It causes much sneezes and hoopla around easter time. 2. What is your favorite color? I don't know? All of them? Rainbow? Sparkles? I think at the top of the list are black, magenta, teal, purple, and chartreuse. 3. What is your favorite scent? Lilac. Or springtime in general. 4. What is my major in college? Animal Science/Pre-vet. Had to take a break for financial reasons, I hope to go back very soon as I'm not getting any younger. 5. What is your favorite song of the moment? Sex Metal Barbie by In This Moment. 6. What is your favorite makeup item you own? This changes about every week but right now it's Stila stay all day lipstick in Como. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna marry that lipstick. 7. What is your favorite animal? All of them. No seriously. I can't pick, animals are my life's passion. Maybe baby goats (kids!). 8. What other languages do you know besides English? I can say a few words in japanese and a few words and phrases in french. 9. What is your favorite fruit? Pineapple. Even on pizza. 10. Do you like indie makeup brands? I want to, I'm just not very good at working loose pigments and some of the prettiest colors are loose and I just get all frustrated. 11. What is a makeup item you've been lusting after? Ohhh I don't know, There's this one Urban Decay lipgloss I've kind of been wanting. 12. Do you have any big plans for the summer? Not really. Pretty much just work and spend as much time in the sun and at the pool as is humanly possible. 13. What is your favorite ice cream flavor? That's pretty much random. I don't have a favorite I just love ice cream. Maybe birthday cake ice cream. 14. Who is your favorite fictional character? Right now it's jesse from breaking bad. 15. What is a makeup item you never use? Anything that says ""dewy"" on it. I'm an oily gal and I don't need to be oilier."

RandomActsofMakeup,37uaur,EmpressHotdog,2,Sun May 31 13:21:39 2015 UTC,Im not sure why I don't use blush actually 😂 I have a couple really nice ones from cover girl. I feel like I don't put it on right like I tried it today and I felt like I had barely any on. But if I try putting on more I feel like I look like I have tons on. 😂 I just can't find the happy medium!! Lol I'll have to practice. And thank you for hosting!
RandomActsofMakeup,37uaur,kitterkatzen,2,Tue Jun 2 20:23:43 2015 UTC,Hmm that is hard. What kind of brush are you using? Do you tap of the excess from your brush so you can build the coverage? I don't usually wear blush since I am already pretty pink w/o foundation. I like crazy colors like blue and purple.
RandomActsofMakeup,37uaur,kitterkatzen,2,Wed Jun 3 02:50:56 2015 UTC,Well I have a few blushes called Maybelline Dream Bouncy Blush it's not a powder it's more like a cream. I think that's why I have trouble with it I'm not too experienced with blush. I may have to experiment more because all this talk about it is making me want to play with it. More lol and I couldn't imagine using those colors on me but I've seen other ladies wear it and it looks so good!!
RandomActsofMakeup,37uaur,lillyandletters,2,Wed Jun 3 15:47:31 2015 UTC,"I think a pressed powder is much easier to work with by far over a cream. I only use cream for a highlight. Creams are way more difficult to blend. I like blush. For me, when I wear foundation I just look so pale so blush adds some color back in. :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,37uaur,BREEZE_BLOCKS,2,Wed Jun 3 16:12:11 2015 UTC,Awesome thank you for the advice! I'll have to go on a hunt for a pressed powder. Do you recommend any?

RandomActsofMakeup,37sxh9,keetleby,3,Sat May 30 03:17:35 2015 UTC,"Can I just say, and your eyes are amazing, but your eyebrows are on point, like seriously perfect.... I can never get mine to look anywhere close to that (without them looking like I have a ton of makeup on my eyebrows).  10/10 perfection."
RandomActsofMakeup,37sxh9,rakkoma,2,Sat May 30 14:33:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That's probably my favorite part of my makeup most days. I do have a ton of makeup on them, but spoolie them to death :P"
RandomActsofMakeup,37sxh9,Cezahn,2,Sat May 30 17:40:56 2015 UTC,Dude. Those earrings are baller. Also love the orange smokey eye. I keep trying that look but I can never get it as pretty as yours.

RandomActsofMakeup,37sxh9,mrscrankshaft,2,Sat May 30 17:42:06 2015 UTC,"Both your eyebrows and eyeliner look flawless here! (Also, in my experience a halo eye means that it's dark in both the inner and outer corners, but I might be wrong about that.)"

RandomActsofMakeup,37sqha,PeaceLoveLindzy,3,Sat May 30 02:15:38 2015 UTC,"Omg I love this contest!! I just recently learned to contour myself and I love what it has done to my makeup routine.   This video by Jaclyn Hill is my favorite. She uses the cream contour kit by Anastasia. I think that one might be for people that are more advanced. I got the Anastasia Contour Kit as my first contour product, but for the money, I don't think it's the best buy. I am fair with pink undertones like you and I only used two colors and I felt like the contour shades were too dark for me.   This palette from Make Up For Ever is simple. Two colors, one to set your highlight shade and one to sculpt and contour with.   I also recommend using a concealer to highlight. You can get an idea of how to do that in this video. I personally have that concealer she uses and I love it the most. Here is a link for it at sephora.   As for a trick, if you don't have a fancy contour brush, just take an eyeshadow brush and put the contour where you want it then blend it out with a fluffy face brush. Works just as good.  For every person who wants to find a way to contour, there is a different method or set of products. This is what works for me and I love it. Good luck on that journey, girl. Thanks for hosting."
RandomActsofMakeup,37sqha,allycakes13,3,Sat May 30 03:17:17 2015 UTC,"I have come across this so many times and have picked are few tips that I can actually do, and I am not great at makeup!  I have this palette and I friggin love it!  I don't know any tricks though! :(. Thanks for the contest!"
RandomActsofMakeup,37sqha,To_each_their_0wn,3,Sat May 30 03:21:04 2015 UTC,"Oh man I struggled with this forever. Coming from one pale redhead to another, it's really easy to go overboard. Here's what works for me. I really like this diagram for beginners. I recommend shading around the outer portion of your forehead and cheeks, and bring it in where your cheeks would naturally sink in for your jaw/teeth. I really don't recommend wrapping the contour under your jaw like you'll see in a lot of tutorials because being pale it can be very obvious. A cool brown that doesn't pull red or orange is key to not looking ruddy or dirty. A great budget option is NYX Taupe if you can find it. I really recommend Benefit's Hoola because it's a fantastic shade and it lasts years (literally), making it a great value. I've had mine a year and a half and I'm about halfway through it with liberal daily use. Use a glowy highlighter on the points of your face that are naturally higher, like the tops of your cheekbones, nose, and forehead. This can emphasize the contrast of your face. You want to place your blush in between. Hope this helps/inspires you!"
RandomActsofMakeup,37sqha,SmartAleck08,2,Sat May 30 04:19:22 2015 UTC,"I have pale skin with neutral undertones and while I'm still learning to contour but what I've found works really well if you're on a budget is using a dusty brown eyeshadow. I have a Coastal Scents 120 Color Palette that has a bunch of ash toned browns and greys that work really well. I stay with a cool toned color because it looks more like a shadow than like I'm obviously wearing a contour product. I use an ELF Contour Brush to apply it and then use a fluffy face brush to blend it out. The brush is about $3 and the palette is $20 but Costal Scents frequently has sales on their single shadows for under 2 bucks. I don't think you can get much cheaper for a contour than that.   As far as absurd tricks go, this one is more for darker, warm toned skin colors, but this video from Maha Maven shows her using a Red Jumbo Eyeliner Pencil as her contour. I didn't think it would look good but it looks incredible and you would never guess!   Thank you for hosting this contest and best of luck with your contouring."
RandomActsofMakeup,37sqha,raezura,2,Sat May 30 04:10:51 2015 UTC,"This contour palette is amazing and at a great price. I almost regret buying the ABH powder contour palette since this one came out. Look up swatches for the colors because Ulta's site isn't so accurate.    I really like this MAC Prep+Prime duo. I use the pink to correct dark circles and the yellow shade to highlight under the eyes, on the bridge of my nose, and on my forehead. All blending is done with a beauty blender. I set everything with highlighting powder from the contour kit and then work on contouring with a darker shade.  Tutorial wise, here is a simple review and demo of the NYX palette  for a really natural contour look. And here is one of her using the ABH palette (I personally like this tutorial better)."
RandomActsofMakeup,37sqha,devodeevs,2,Sat May 30 04:37:01 2015 UTC,I watched /u/Sssamanthaa's channel recently - she did a tutorial using the ABH cream contour kit here. I have the Coastal scents camouflage palette which is a lot cheaper and works really good as well.  I don't really have a trick per se since I still use a face product but I don't use a bronzer all over my face but use it for contouring my face.  Thanks for the contest!

RandomActsofMakeup,37sqha,LinzDarling,1 point,Sat May 30 21:28:53 2015 UTC,"Hey! I can't enter (Canada) but wanted to recommend the sleek contour kit! Its ruler simple, two shades (contour/highlight) its very inexpensive, and I've had mine for over a year and haven't hit pan yet. Good luck in your contour journey! :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,37sqha,duckducknarwhal,1 point,Sat May 30 23:01:48 2015 UTC,"Get a contour colour that's right for you. Something fairly light and grey toned. Find your cheek bones. Take a flashlight (I'm not kidding) and shine it down at your face and on an angle to see where the bones protrude. Once you know where the highest and deepest parts of your cheek are, smush the contour powder into the deepest part and then blend UP, making sure it never touches the highest part. Contouring requires highlighting. Get a concealer (something cheap) that's a shade or two too light. Draw a straight line down the highest part of your cheek bone. Contour your nose. It's fun, and easier than cheeks.    Products: I recommend Pumpkin and Poppy Oak Bark (forgiving, affordable grey-toned contour powder), Real Techniques Contouring Brush (I like the Bold Metals one because it makes me feel fancy, but the normal one is probably easier to work with) and Hourglass Ethereal Light (a nice matte highlight)."
RandomActsofMakeup,37sqha,mermaidunicornhybrid,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:48:27 2015 UTC,"Since you say you are more novice with contouring, you might not want to try my tip/trick but I will throw it in anyway since not many people may do this: contouring with self tanner.  :)  I saw a bottle of St. Tropez at Costco for $12, so I thought why not? I place some on a palette and use a synthetic brush to apply as I would my normal bronzer and contour. If you use natural hair brushes, they will get stained.  You can control how dark you want it, and go over several times where you want it more shaded.  Where you contour depends on your face shape, but many people like to follow the ""3 and E"" method. It might look scary, but I do this before bed sometimes and after I wash it off, I love the results. This is great for someone who is lazy like me but still wants dat contour. Jeanfeancoiscd has a great video demonstrating this method, and dang does he look glowy."

RandomActsofMakeup,37tmy2,Sixkitties,2,Sat May 30 19:08:17 2015 UTC,"The granola? It was pretty much rolled oats, wheat germ, and golden flaxseed all mixed with honey and a little bit of sugar diluted in warm water. Then you bake at 360 and add whatever extras you want. I just did almonds and cranberries.  d: It's a nice snack and it made a lot."

Right now I'm loving the Coastal Scents Revealed 2 palette I just got in one of the monthly subscription boxes I get.  It has some gorgeous colors that fit my complexion nicely.

I'm fortunate enough to have co-workers who love makeup, but I'm right there with you on lack of storage space in my home for all my makeup.  What are your current favorite products? What brands do you like best?"
RandomActsofMakeup,37rwjr,ReservateThatRoom,2,Fri May 29 22:14:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  You are so lucky to have co-workers like that.  Mine look at me like I've grown a second head if I start talking about it.   My favorite products are mostly Urban Decay, Too Faced & Coastal Scents for eyeshadow.  I am allergic to most liquid eye-liners so I stick mostly to pencils.  Those I usually get the Rimmel, Blinc and Ulta.  I have a great silver liner from Cynthia Rowley that's super creamy and long-lasting.  I love the Too Faces Melted lip line.  I like NYX lip liners and I'm all over the place with lipsticks.  I miss being able to use the long-lasting lip products but I developed a stupid allergy to those, too. GRRR!  There are two products I will never give up as long as they are for sale:  1) Blinc mascara.  Its the only black mascara that doesn't give me coon-eyes! I use the black, brown and purple. 2) My custom mixed liquid foundation from a local makeup artist (Palmina Leone) here in Phoenix.  Its amazing!"

RandomActsofMakeup,37p3zs,aelfaerie,2,Sat May 30 02:04:34 2015 UTC,"Well firstly, don't eat 2 hours beforehand; I tried a light snack once an hour before and I got nauseous only a mile in.  Start jogging in intervals (e.g. jog 1.5 min, walk 1 minute) and slowly up the time. Don't forget to stretch after a warmup. And lastly, don't be afraid of getting a cramp; most ""cramps"" are side stitches and you can run them off as long as you're conscious of breathing a little slower and much deeper."
RandomActsofMakeup,37p3zs,nowthatihavefoundyou,2,Mon Jun 1 13:08:18 2015 UTC,"Just had to share that I am kinda impressed with Amazon's customer service. I had two issues with orders this month (non-makeup related) and both times they went above and beyond what I was expecting to get.   First issue: I paid for next day delivery of 5 items and only received 4 items on time. I contacted them to see what was up and they refunded the entire shipping costs for all items, not just for the item that was late. Awesome!  Second issue: I had purchased a ""prime"" item that I ended up not needing (long story). When I went to do the return process, the site told me that the item was nonreturnable. I hit up customer service because nowhere on the item's listing did it say the item was nonreturnable. They offered to refund me all charges AND told me to keep the product. Sadly, I REALLY don't have any use for the product, but it was amazing service.   In both conversations, I simply stated the issue and they provided the outcome. I didn't need to do any amount complaining that normally comes with contacting customer service. It was so refreshing!"

RandomActsofMakeup,37n472,TheFabHatter,2,Fri May 29 03:19:27 2015 UTC,Camera ready cosmetics online shop. It took a while to get to me though--they ship from California and I live in Michigan. The sealer can only be shipped by ground mail so it can take up to two weeks. USPS is also really really bad about updating ground shipping tracking.
RandomActsofMakeup,37n472,MissBazinga,2,Fri May 29 02:13:14 2015 UTC,"Camera Ready Cosmetics, NorcostCo, and Alcone Company.  Also, you can usually get it at your local theatrical/stage/costume supply store."

RandomActsofMakeup,37mahe,PassthePaper,6,Thu May 28 17:42:38 2015 UTC,"I love to see the product actually worn.  I like swatches, but you need more then that for a review.  If its blush, put it on your face.  If it's lipstick show what it looks on the lips.  Swatches are nice but how you apply makeup and how you swatch makeup are 2 different things."
RandomActsofMakeup,37mahe,Darushi-chan,5,Thu May 28 18:27:29 2015 UTC,"Photos - indicate the type of lighting the photo was taken (flash, no flash, indoor, outdoor, etc.). If the color of the product in the photo is not true to life for whatever reason, that's a good thing to let your readers know also.   Swatches - arm swatches and applied swatches (lipstick on lips, foundation on face, mascara on eyes etc), indicate the number of layers on arm swatches   I also appreciate blogs that describe the texture of the product and also the smell.   Size comparison is also useful! Like if you're reviewing a powder compact, take a picture next to an iPhone or something for sense of scale.   It's also useful to indicate your skin tone by way of MAC (NW or NC number) foundations or other brands when doing arm swatches. For face products, talk about which skin tones they may be suitable for.   Longevity of the product! How many hours it lasts before the product starts to fade.   If the product has a pump or spray nozzle, indicate how well it works, like if the spray comes out as a light mist or heavy droplets.   Let us know your thoughts on packaging too! Plastic, glass, how it feels in your hand, etc.   Availability - limited edition? Online only? Only available in specific country or store? Etc.   Cost of product and include link for where to buy.   Summarize the review with overall thoughts and whether or not you would recommend the product.   Sorry for the curt writeup. I'm literally just typing as I go.   Good luck on your blog and sorry for the long list! I do a lot of research before I buy products and I buy makeup online more often than in person, so I look for a lot of things (as you can see) before I take the plunge and buy stuff, haha.   Hope this helps!"
RandomActsofMakeup,37mahe,kittiemomo,2,Thu May 28 19:46:12 2015 UTC,Ah thank you this is super useful! Going to make this a checklist before posting anything from now on! I'll have to head over to MAC and finally get a match!
RandomActsofMakeup,37mahe,kittiemomo,2,Thu May 28 20:23:46 2015 UTC,"No problem! I just thought I'd something else... You should mention your skin type too because obviously something that works well on oily skin may not work as well as on dry skin.   When showing foundation in your face, also indicate what tools you used for the application (beauty blender, fingers, foundation brush). If you use all three, indicate which one would work best :)   PM a link to your blog! I would love to check it out. :)"

I have the Revealed palette and I love it (I'm too cheap to invest in a Naked palette, but I hear they aren't really worth the money anyway) but the samples for Revealed 3 were just horribly disappointing. Patchy, hard to blend, not much pigmentation. I expected a lot better considering how much I love the other palette :/ at least it was a sample so I didn't really lose any money on it."

I saw so many reviews for Revealed and swatches that showed the colors are basically identical dupes for Naked 1 & 2 and I've been very impressed by them. Wonderful for the price and I use that palette almost daily!  But yeah I definitely will not be spending the money for Revealed 3. Maybe the four shadows I got in the sample were just crappy formula compared to the rest of the colors and even though its only $20, it's not a risk I'm willing to take."

RandomActsofMakeup,37dtdf,ratfinkmks,1 point,Wed May 27 18:02:38 2015 UTC,"Smashbox photo ready primer-- I have tried both the original and the green and neither worked for me. The green exacerbated my already dry skin, which actually led to me breaking out worse and the original made my skin feel greasy and didn't seem to make much of a difference in how my makeup work. I know some people love these so I'm sad they didn't work for me. Still on the hunt for my HG primer (I've tried Hourglass, Laura Geller, Laura Mercier, UD and open to suggestions for dry, somewhat sensitive and acne prone skin)   UD Naked 2 palette- Another one that I know is well-loved that just didn't work for me personally. I do love a couple of the colors (Foxy and Half Baked), but a lot of them were duds for me. I think I probably would have liked the original or Naked 3 better since I just found these colors a little too muddy for my taste, but this was the first palette I bought when getting into makeup two years ago so I didn't know any better at the time. As far as neutral palettes go, I find myself reaching for my Too Faced Naked Eyes much more.   KVD Liquid Lipstick in Lolita- The formula on these is my absolute favorite as far as all of the liquid lipsticks I have tried go (way better than Melted IMO) and I absolutely love the one I have in Underage Red. Sadly, however, this color does not work for me AT ALL. Seeing the swatches on other fair skinned ladies, I would have thought I would love it, but it reads a much darker brown on me than I was expecting. Because I know it's so hard to come by and others love it so much, I am thinking I will probably give mine away at some point.   Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara- I read a comment one time where someone called this ""better than nothing mascara"" and that really sums up my feelings on it. I found it clumpy and hard to apply and I think there are drugstore mascaras out there that will do the trick cheaper.   UD Perversion Mascara- I feel similarly about this to Better Than Sex. I'm not a fan of the wand shape and I find it applies clumpy."

I'm one of those ""grew out of it"" people, but in a way I feel like it never suited me in the first place. Basically I didn't feel like the products were geared toward my skintone at all and once I got a little older, I realized that there were other brands that had ranges more suited to someone like me.  I did just recently buy my first Clinique products in probably a decade. It was a trial size kit from Sephora with a chubby lip thing and two moisturizers. One of the moisturizers I remember from back in the day and might rebuy because it's really nice and light. It's the moisture surge gel/cream. The lip product was moisturizing but disappeared in my already pigmented lips, so this might go back to ""not for my skintone.""  The skin products in general that I remember trying seemed fairly ineffective and I wouldn't go back to trying them. The gift bags with purchase were probably some of the best, but once again many of the products didn't suit me so it was a waste."

As for the lip crayon, I love the color, a lot, and it's pretty hydrating, but it doesn't last. I find that it rubs off within an hour.

RandomActsofMakeup,37bm12,imhereforthemeta,3,Tue May 26 18:41:52 2015 UTC,"I SWIM IN PRIMER AND ALMOST ANNOYINGLY HARD TO GET OFF LINER. I do roller derby in a warehouse in Texas and the heat/sweat is insane..Like crossfit in 120 degree weather insane.  I know everyone hates it, but the benefit push up liner is so aggressively ""fuck you I won't leave your face"" that its really useful for this. That shit can stick through ANYTHING. Just be ready to scrub your eyes with makeup wipes like the devil.  I also use Urban Decays primer potion, and the combo is like, absolutely perfect for eyes. Not so much as a single smudge.   As for the face, I tend to avoid product when im sweating because I am very acne prone, but I hope the eye tip is helpful."
RandomActsofMakeup,37bm12,lilpeedee,1 point,Tue May 26 19:30:55 2015 UTC,thank you so much!  I do have that eyeliner and you ate right about it not wanting to come off.  But Vaseline and a q tip helps with the removal.
RandomActsofMakeup,37bm12,starwish216,2,Fri May 29 01:06:28 2015 UTC,"I use the Hourglass mineral Veil primer (which gives a sort of matte finish), then use the Wayne Goss method of dusting some loose powder over the primer but under the foundation.  Then I do foundation, then loose powder again.  It helps a lot and I live in Fl.  I also use Shine Stopper by Paula's Choice on my nose and chin, it works wonders for keeping that area matte.  You can order samples from her website for super cheap to try it out."

Two things that work really well for me are Kat Von D's Tattoo liner and KissMe Heroine Make mascaras. A warning about KissMe mascaras tho, that stuff does not come off, transfer, budge, move, even flinch in anyway, so when it comes to taking it off, the company has actually made a special makeup remover for it - because its staying powers are that insane."

She's homeschooled because she threw bitch fits growing up saying she hated school. She's pissed at me for calling her out but I feel like some one should say something before she gets knocked up or killed by this guy. All they do is smoke weed and have sex. She cut herself and begged to be put in a mental hospital when he was sent to one.   I'm crazy. Really, I get the psychotic relationship thing. I've done some WTF things in my past but I'm thisclose to just letting loose. Only reason I get pissed is cause I care and she's too stupid to see that. I've known her since she was 10."

RandomActsofMakeup,379j71,PassthePaper,4,Mon May 25 23:47:24 2015 UTC,"If you are near a Sephora I recommend going there. The new color IQ thing is awesome. Its a machine and it takes 3 close up pictures of your skin, one on your forehead, cheek and neck. It uses the pictures and pulls up all your matches that are in the store. You can then filter it by skin texture or how much coverage you want or if you want liquid or powder. For the first time in a very long time my foundation matches lovely."

RandomActsofMakeup,377cuq,looumaaa,4,Mon May 25 14:03:43 2015 UTC,"It's easier to see a full face of makeup when you post a head on shot. The profile-only photos are pretty, but we only get to see one side of your face, so when you address things like brows and eye bags, the angle of the photo does not allow the viewer to get an accurate look of these features when you've positioned your head and face like that. It seems more like an Instagram-style shot. To me, your brows look thick with hair, not as if they've been drawn on and are flat. What's the actual issue with your brows: the routine of covering the bald spots? the products you're using? the technique?    That said, are you color correcting before your concealer? Are you drinking enough water? Do you get enough sleep? Do you use a depuffing agent on your eyes before your makeup? All of these things can come into effect when considering the appropriate coverage of undereye bags. If they're actual puffy spots, something to cool or depuff the skin will help. If they're dark colored, you want to do some color correcting before applying your concealer. Skincare is critical, as well."
RandomActsofMakeup,377cuq,glittergash,1 point,Mon May 25 18:31:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your comment 💖 that type of picture is the one I feel comfortable doing and the one it looks better since I still own an iPhone 4s, but you are right 😊 I didn't think of showing the things I want to get better at. When I submitted this look the first thing I noticed are my eye bags, I'm sure you can see them and I do drink water and the whole deal, they just run in my family. I use a depuff cream but it's not enough and I'm probably going to have to do surgery for that.   Totally right with the eyebrows, maybe I should have not draw them and show the spots but the makeup was so pretty that I didn't want to ruin it with bad eyebrows hshaha I guess I just want advice from someone that has the same problem and what do they use to regrow hair 😊  Again, thank you so much for giving me your points of view. I'll work on that 💖"
RandomActsofMakeup,377cuq,glittergash,2,Tue May 26 00:37:34 2015 UTC,"I actually don't see your eye bags at all from that angle. You probably notice them more than others, and more than likely think they are worse than they really are. It follows the same logic of ""we are our worst critic."" Though I can't tell much given the angle of the photos, your bags don't appear to be that noticeable to me, personally.    Same thing with the brows, it's hard to see the areas you have issues. I think you should do half your face with makeup and then take a head on photo to show kind of a B&A of your face, that way people can really see the difference between the two, which may give context to your issues at hand. Your brows look really nice in that photo, so for me it's difficult to spot anything ""problematic"" with them.    But seriously...do you do any sort of color correcting for your circles? And what depuffing agent are you using?    Also, thanks for responding politely to my post. Sometimes people in the makeup subs here on Reddit can take quick offense to something like what I wrote. I appreciate you reading my response and then following it up with a thoughtful, drama-free answer :)"

RandomActsofMakeup,377cuq,DevilishDreamer,2,Mon May 25 14:23:00 2015 UTC,"I think your brows are a very nice shape for your face. :) The only real CC I have is that, although I love both, I don't think the lipstick quite pairs with the eyes. That lipstick is killer on you, but maybe with a neutral eye with a tiny pop of colour on your bottom lash line? I love the bronze eyes, but maybe with a nude/pinkish lip, less brown.   Edit: I've got some pretty scary darkness under my eyes, I use Maybelline's master conceal out of convenience, does a pretty good job. I use a slightly lighter shade. Also, Hard Candy's Glamoflauge. If I were able, I'd get me some nice hardcore concealer. I've heard Kat Von D's tattoo concealer is pretty excellent, but I've never tried it."

I went into Sephora yesterday to see about getting myself a gift, and saw nothing I really needed or wanted. Doing my research on products I'm interested has really helped me be wise about needless spending. I ended up getting a facemask since I'm getting into skincare, it was nice but also really weird because I've never used a sheet mask before. I felt like Dwight when he cut off the face of the training dummy.  I got my wedding ring yesterday! It's the biggest expense for my wedding, and I got payments started.

RandomActsofMakeup,36urr6,brennalarosa,2,Fri May 22 16:47:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the warning. I've heard good things about Benefit's They're Real Push-Up Eyeliner. It's a gel in a felt-tip. Have you tried it? I'm thinking of giving it a shot myself.

I don't have to go light-handed as with other pencils.   Cons     Expensive & not available in Singapore. The entire pencil is really short and doesn't last for more than 3 months with constant usage.

I don't if the shade was too dark or what, but my eyebrows just looked awful. I have pretty thick eyebrows on my own, so even when I'm using a pencil I hate how they look. I try to just give them shape and it looks... like a blob.  I SO BADLY wanted to like it because there's so many people who can use it so damn well."
RandomActsofMakeup,36kxm5,shes-fresh-to-death,5,Wed May 20 07:53:43 2015 UTC,"If you want, maybe you should post a CCW? Not sure if you have already, but that's an option.

RandomActsofMakeup,36kxm5,MissyTX,3,Wed May 20 09:31:30 2015 UTC,"I actually got rid of the pomade back in January I believe because it was just such a waste of money for me to have it (thank you, Sephora return policy). I don't usually do brows just because I hate how they do look like sharpies, as you put it, but next time I'm practicing I'll post some pictures!"
RandomActsofMakeup,36kxm5,XSTall,3,Wed May 20 13:28:42 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you on this. I used the lightest shade she has, but for some reason it never looked natural on my brows...always looked like I had rubbed a bunch of dirt on them lol."
RandomActsofMakeup,36kxm5,GoddessOfPizza,3,Wed May 20 14:46:59 2015 UTC,"I have full, thick brows already, so I don't fill them in. I've used ABH brow gel before and it glued my eyebrows in place. I don't need something that strong for everyday wear. I use the Contour Kit daily. The liquid lipsticks are nice. I have tiny lips, so I have to apply them with my finger to get the right amount. That makes them a little bit of a hassle to put on. These wear off if I eat and transfer a little if I drink, but I don't have any liquid lipsticks that last through eating. I own Retro Coral and Lovely; both shades are really beautiful."
RandomActsofMakeup,36kxm5,princessbubbleguum,3,Wed May 20 10:01:47 2015 UTC,"I have the Dipbrow Pompade in Ebony and I absolutely love it. I've tried a lot of different products, starting with pencils, then moving to powder kits, then dipbrow. In my experience it's the only thing that keeps my power brows looking fierce all day long. It is super pigmented, so it took me awhile to learn how to apply it right. The brush/spooley combo is really helpful here to get exactly the brows you want."
RandomActsofMakeup,36kxm5,MintyLotus,2,Wed May 20 15:48:06 2015 UTC,I have the anastasia beverly hills Pomade in dark brown i really love it !   Pros: easy to use   A little goes along way   Many different colors   Cons: probably no brush with it you have to buy separate or use another one. I use the ecotool angles brush it works well with it  I've been dying to try to contour set though!
RandomActsofMakeup,36kxm5,MintyLotus,2,Wed May 20 04:06:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's a decent brand overall. I'm not a huge fan of their shadows: they're lovely swatched, but at least for me, I find the fallout to be more than I'd like and the pigmentation a bit sheer.   I have the ABH Dipbrow in Ebony, and it's one of my favorite products. It's really versatile: I use it for my brows and also for tightlining, juuust softer-than-black eyeliner, and drawing facial hair on. Because the product is really pigmented, but still blendable, you don't need a lot, so it lasts a long time. The nature of the product also means that I can get a really defined brow or a really soft, barely there, super natural brow and everything in between. The staying power is also quite nice: I used to use black eyeshadow, which I really liked the color and general look of, but because I don't have a lot of hair on the tails of my brows (well, none now, since I shaved them off), my brows would wipe off easily throughout the day if I wasn't careful.  I'm interested in trying their liquid lipsticks!"
RandomActsofMakeup,36kxm5,it_was_jim,3,Wed May 20 05:58:57 2015 UTC,I'm interested in their liquid lipsticks too! I'm always on the lookout for a new liquid lipstick because I can never find a product that stays on my lips for more than an hour or so!

They are hands down the most pigmented, long lasting lip products I own. And when I say long lasting I mean eat, sleep, make out proof without going patchy or smudging. Also since they come with a gloss on the other side I don't get the dry feeling I do with other liquid lipsticks."
RandomActsofMakeup,36kxm5,parece_mentira,2,Tue May 26 11:08:55 2015 UTC,"I have several ABH products. I own Dip Brow and Brow Wiz in Ebony which used to hold a special place in my heart but have since found an almost exact dupe.   I own almost all of the eyeshadow palettes they have released - with the exception of Catwalk and Lavish palettes. I seem to find that they are of very good quality. The price of the palettes they release are usually around $30 and I think its a good price. I hardly ever touch the Amrezy and Maya Mia palettes but the others are awesome (Tamanna, Artist).   I have owned a few of the liquid lipsticks from ABH (Lovely and Spicy) and while they were a bit drying, the price point for the amount of grams you receive made it worth purchasing. I don't feel that the liquid lipsticks transfer and are almost completely smudge proof (with the exception of eating oily foods, etc).   I don't own any of the contour kits because I don't see myself using them on a weekly basis and it really isn't my thing but the cream contour kit looks nice.   Overall, ABH products are of high quality and are in a price range where you can choose to splurge every once and a while. But sometimes, the pricing is a killer. Especially at $20 a lipstick!"

At the time I didn't know filling in brows were even a thing but it makes such a big difference! I have the brow wiz as well and I love the small point on it for drawing fine hair like lines but it's pretty pricey for the amount of product you get."
RandomActsofMakeup,36kxm5,parece_mentira,1 point,Thu May 21 07:25:51 2015 UTC,i wanna try dipbrow and see how it holds up in the humid south florida inferno. i've been using maybelline define-a-brow which is fine when it's cooler out but i need something that will stay put for the 8+ hours that i need it to survive. anyone else have experience with this?
RandomActsofMakeup,36kxm5,KKJules821,3,Thu May 21 18:20:33 2015 UTC,"I live in SoFlo and use dipbrow daily. It's a godsend! That stuff will NOT move no matter how much I sweat. I have normal to dry skin though, so products tend to stay longer on my skin than they do on some of my friends' oily skin. So take that into consideration as well. :)"

RandomActsofMakeup,36ka7c,KKJules821,2,Wed May 20 04:23:25 2015 UTC,"Welcome, Esmer! Do you have any preferred brands for eyeshadows and generally eye makeup?"
RandomActsofMakeup,36jev5,lydiadovecry,3,Tue May 19 20:46:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, talc is popular because it tends to suck up excess moisture, ie oil. And MAC is a line that is generally more oily/combo skin friendly versus dry skin friendly, hence a lot of their products contain talc.  Have you tried cream products, or products marketed towards dry skin? Most of the glowy Hourglass powders are talc-free, for example, as are many Colourpop products.  Also, have you tried plugging stuff in to Cosdna.com?"
RandomActsofMakeup,36jev5,HereComesBadNews,1 point,Tue May 19 22:32:17 2015 UTC,"such a bummer, my sister gave me several MAC powders and blushes that i cannot use now. I have no idea what Cosdna.com is.  Can you explain to me why oil and moisture sucking products would cause clogging of pores? I know I have dry skin, but...I dunno seems weird. I certainly believe it though."
RandomActsofMakeup,36jev5,HereComesBadNews,1 point,Thu May 21 03:05:24 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean that it clogs pores because it sucks up oil. Everybody breaks out to different things for different reasons. I meant that's why it's in a lot of products geared towards oily-skinned people (like most of MAC's line). So if you're sensitive to it and you use those types of products, you're going to break out. If you look for products that are geared towards dry-skinned people, though, they're less likely to contain talc. You should still check the ingredients, but it's a good starting point.  Just go to Cosdna.com and type in a product. It's an ingredient database."
RandomActsofMakeup,36jev5,royalchariot01,1 point,Thu May 21 03:22:57 2015 UTC,"I know Physician's Formula has several talc-free products. I am pretty fond of their powders and blushes. Not ALL of their items are talc-free but if they are it will say so on the label.  I also know that a lot of these brands have several blushes, bronzers, and highlighters that are talc free: Cargo NARS theBalm Smashbox MakeupGeek  hope that helps and good luck!"

RandomActsofMakeup,36ikr2,LinzDarling,1 point,Tue May 19 21:32:11 2015 UTC,Thank you! I never actually mean to cover them up but I tend to get very red so they sometimes end up hidden under more full coverage foundations.

RandomActsofMakeup,36ic27,LinzDarling,1 point,Tue May 19 21:39:51 2015 UTC,"Oh my gosh, it's so hard to give pointers since everyone is different.  I have tried A LOT of products, trying to find a red that matches my dyed hair and conceals my brown eyebrow hairs (as you can see, they still kindof stand out in the photos) has been the hardest part.  I tried dipbrow and HATED it, it completely melted off my face, while everyone else insisted it was bullet proof.  My routine for now is that I start with primer over my entire eyelid and eyebrows so that the product won't budge when my face gets greasy.  I use two eyebrow pencils, NYX eyebrow pencil in Dark Brown and Sketch Stick in Redhead.  I generally follow the shape of my natural brows (which are incredibly sad and look like this), and with hairlike strokes, fill in the outer 2/3 with the NYX pencil.  Then I very, very lightly flick my pencil in hairlike strokes with the Sketch Stick on the inner 1/3 so that they look ""natural"" (or as natural as I can drawing them in with a pencil).  You can tell from that imgur album that was about a year ago how much my technique has changed."

I'm trying Anastasia Dipbrow for the first time! I always just used a pencil until now, but I wanted to step up my game. I also got Clinique Instant Lift for Brows though because I know sometimes I'll be too lazy for dipbrow, ha ha! I haven't tried that either, but it looks perfect for me!  I spent like 3 days deciding on what to get and I'm so glad I did because then the the Tarte Bright by Night set went on sale for $10, I'm also pretty new to taking care of my skin, I'm really excited to try both products, especially the oil since I've never tried one before. I'm trying Shaveworks Cool Fix since I have a lot of shaving troubles too, all stuff I've never tried before :)  I feel like the freebies were especially good this time. I did the new promo to pick 3 deluxe samples and chose the Algenist Moisturizer, MDSolar Sciences Beauty Balm, and Fresh Sugar Lip Polish (which I've been dying to try!)  The normal freebies I got were Diorshow Mascara, Alien Perfume, and Dr. Brandt Do Not Age Serum.  Plus, I now have 280 points which is the most I think I've ever had at once since I usually redeem at 100 because I'm impatient."

Ciate, which is available at Sephora, carries other colors such as pink, green, and turquoise (I own the green and turquoise ones).

Any tips on this one?  I'm going to try mixing it with my foundation, I've heard people get good results from that.  I was underwhelmed with the Tarte lip tint.  Honestly I only got it because I had 5x points on Tarte and I liked the color.  It's ok, but doesn't last very long.  I haven't tried the eyeliner in this color yet.  I also have it in black, but I couldn't pass up the Lilac color."

Fed up with always having to look after everyone else and no one giving a crap about me. Always having to be independent all the time. Watching other people be fawned over and cared for. Never having someone look after me on a bad day. Never having someone care enough to call me when I post I'm feeling down. Never following me out the pub if I leave clearly stressed out.

I just recently found about about the BareMinerals mystery boxes I finally got the e-mail for one and jumped at the chance. This box was $45 and supposedly has a $185 dollar value. Overall I'm pretty happy to try some new BareMinerals products :)! Did anyone else order this as well?  The Contents   Double Ended Buff & Conceal Brush Ready Luminizer in Love Affair/Shining Moment  Big & Bright Eyeliner in Espresso  5-1 BB Mineral Veil  Blush in Sweet Romance  Marvelous Moxie Lipstick in Dim The Lights Natural Light Face Lifting Duo in Well Lit/Back Lit  Skin Rev-er Upper Ready Veil in Translucent Whipped Velvet Duo Shadows in Deep Sky/ Rich Olive

RandomActsofMakeup,3689wk,myownstunts,1 point,Sun May 17 18:08:50 2015 UTC,"I love BareMinerals! I heard many people say their foundations make your skin look orange but I've never noticed that (went through one bottle, but I'm not going to repurchase due to its price). Did you get the chance to try the lipstick?"
RandomActsofMakeup,3689wk,mclairewar,1 point,Sun May 17 11:54:25 2015 UTC,"I really love the brand as well! I find that it lasts me forever and looks really good on my skin! I just  swatched the lipstick and it goes on so smooth! Very pretty,wearable color too!"

I got BareMinerals foundation as a present from my awesome mom-in-law, but am not ready to buy something this expensive... Do you have a nice substitute for it?"
RandomActsofMakeup,3689wk,lolhaibai,2,Wed May 20 03:05:47 2015 UTC,"If you live in Europe, look for Avril foundations! They're way cheaper and all natural. Otherwise, I've heard good things about Bourjois, though I'm not sure about the ingredient list. I'd make sure there are no silicones in the formula — as long as you know that, any foundation would work great IMO. BareMinerals is good as it's natural, but the staying power was not that good for me."

Placement seems perfect for you, but blending could use some work. You might want to try some nicer quality brushes, they do wonders believe it or not because it looks like your blending is nearly there. You may want to try lining your brows with concealer for a crisper sort of look which I feel works better with bold looks such as electric palette.   Overall I think this is pretty awesome and well done and looks so good on you!"

I just think the transition would look smoother if instead of a concealer, you opted for a nude lipstick instead. :) I think it would be easier to blend if the pale colored product was moisturizing. :)"

You get more then one bandage with   Scaraway  can be found at most walmarts in the bandage section and can be cleaned by hand and reused as well. They take a while for older scars tho. Check ebay for Scarfx I think they are called they are really good bandages to.

I exfoliate the area, (with either chemical exfoliants like alpha hydrox stuff or sometimes with physical ones like St Ives) then use straight vitamin E oil on them, rubbing a pretty hefty amount in, usually before I go to bed. I've also found that those silicon scar pads overnight/for a few days followed with E oil when I take the pad off works pretty well too. Vitamin E oil and scar pads are usually  easy to find at places like CVS or Walgreens. I hope you find something that helps!"
RandomActsofMakeup,360zml,LadyBosie,1 point,Fri May 15 04:31:15 2015 UTC,"I've been battling my brows since birth because I have relatively small and delicate features and I have these beastly man brows. One thing I've learnt is that if you're going to shape them, you should take it slowly and shape them as your brow grows. If you're not sure what shape, I use to cover up my brow with foundation/concealer and then draw on different brow shapes to see which one I liked (Im sure there's better ways to figure it out, that was just my brows for dumbies way haha). So figure out what shape you're after, and little by little, get rid of the sparse hairs that you don't want (don't do too much in one go) and in the area where you want there to be brow, but none is growing or it's not very full, this is where brow products save the day.  Anastasia has a fantastic range of brow products. Their brow wiz pencil won't disappoint you, I promise. The Dipbrow is god-send, but like all gel based products, I feel like you have to work your way to it, cuz it can get a bit messy if you're new to the game. Anastasia brow powder duo is pretty amazing, I do find that when you're in a rush, powders are easier (read:faster) to use than the dipbrow. If you'd like to try but not keen to spend, Revlon does a decent brow powder duo. If you're set on the Dipbrow, the trick is to do feather light small stroke that resemble hair so your brows don't look too heavy. Another HG brow product I love is the eyeko brow gel. It just neatens everything, and I feel like my brows (+face) look more put together and I can also darken or lighten my brows according to my current hair colour. I hope this helps! We're all on our own brow journey :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,360zml,starwish216,1 point,Fri May 15 14:44:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I really appreciate it. I'm hesitant about the brow wiz because I remember trying one of their pencils and hating how stiff it was.  Right now I have the Dipbrow and the Clinique Instant Lift for Brows pencil in my cart (I tried the pencil in store and liked it) but now I'm waffling again and looking at powders.  I might just end up buying all of it and returning what I don't like! I'm definitely going to get the pencil as well as one of the other things though so I can still do slap some color on my brows when I'm in a rush!"
RandomActsofMakeup,360zml,starwish216,1 point,Fri May 15 17:09:05 2015 UTC,"Glad to help! The brow wiz is a waxier pencil, probably why you thought it was a little stiff. The good thing about waxy brow pencils is they tend to hold brow hairs in place as well as their longevity (I touch my face a lot - weird habit I know - so my eyebrows disappear by the end of the day if I'm not careful) Waxy pencils tend to be stiffer at the start so you'll need to break it in a little, then it becomes smoother."

RandomActsofMakeup,35ydc6,-cutestofborg-,7,Thu May 14 15:45:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely clean face. I love clients who come onto my counter with literally no make up on because they want a match. Sometimes if you've already got your foundation on, you have a preconceived idea of what colour you want and can get a bit distracted by matching it to the foundation rather than your skin tone. It's also nice to see what someone's skin is like overall so you can properly advise which foundations are best."
RandomActsofMakeup,35ydc6,ILikePillowForts,3,Thu May 14 17:11:13 2015 UTC,"Clean face! You can try matching the foundation to your neck if you have an uneven skintone.  But also, I'm not sure if you're doing this already,  but a green tinted primer can help neutralize the redness. my mom has it pretty bad, and I bought her elf green tinted primer and she said it really helps when her flare ups weren't that bad. There's more expensive ones by smashbox that might be better if it's really bad."
RandomActsofMakeup,35ydc6,Sixkitties,2,Thu May 14 16:31:08 2015 UTC,"Clean face for sure. In most foundations I actually buy 2 shades and blend to match how tan/pale I am at the time.   If you're going for the same foundation, easy, you can compare it with a darker/lighter shade, or even take your existing one along to a different counter if you want to see how it compares."

I've tried the Colorstay foundation (my shade is Nude) and I've used up 2 bottles of it, so I guess I really enjoy it lol. I use it off and on with other foundations; it's nice for when I want a fuller coverage. The Colorstay concealer is not my favorite though; it doesn't last as long as I need it to.  I recently got some Revlon Photo Ready transclusent finishing pressed powder but haven't had a chance to try it out yet. Looks okay though! Just wish it was in a more compact case for traveling, it's sort of awkward and long."
RandomActsofMakeup,35s7ht,KristinOhh,1 point,Thu May 14 01:17:14 2015 UTC,My favourite foundation of all time was by Revlon. It was their Age Defying with Botafirm for dry skin. Holy crap! It gave great coverage and looked natural. Every other foundation I've tried cakes up on me no matter what. I'm sad they discontinued it.   Also adore their colorstay liner. It's my HG.

RandomActsofMakeup,35jdme,hannerzbananerz,2,Sun May 10 23:08:15 2015 UTC,Welcome!!!!  What are you most excited about learning?
RandomActsofMakeup,35jdme,Raewynrh,1 point,Mon May 11 01:00:43 2015 UTC,"Other than a little bit of everything, I'm hoping to learn about eyebrows and eyeliner/eyeshadow, and then eventually foundation and all that goodness. I'm blonde and have relatively light/indeterminately colored eyebrows. They're a little fuzzy, but it's not super obvious, since they're not dark brown or black, and I've always wondered what, if anything, I could/should be doing with them :P  When I play with my eyeliner, I often find that I've made my eyes look really little/much rounder or something than they are, and it's not really flattering. I can tell it's wrong, but am never certain why!  What did you most want to learn when you started looking into makeupery?"
RandomActsofMakeup,35jdme,Raewynrh,2,Tue May 12 17:00:14 2015 UTC,"For your eyebrows, you might want to look into having them threaded by a pro, then you can keep up with plucking the fuzzy hairs.  NYX makes some decent eyebrow powder duos.  You might want to experiment with filling them lightly with a powder just a bit darker than your natural color.  Powder is easy to correct if you go overboard and it's a nice way to start grooming your brows without it looking to harsh.    Eyeliner is difficult, especially when you are just getting used to it!  If you want an easy way to try liquid liner I would recommend the Club Clio Waterproof brush tip eyeliner.  I find its easy to get a smooth line.  I usually just line my top eye lid.  I keep it thin and follow the natural shape of my eye lid.  I learned A LOT from youtube to be honest but the best feedback I've gotten has been from posting photos here.  I think I was most excited about lipstick and eyeshadow.  I still looooove eyeshadow but I usually just wear winged liner and lipstick on my lazy days. :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,35jdme,Raewynrh,2,Tue May 12 23:30:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I just looked at some pictures of eyebrow threading, but what's happening? Is the person grabbing the hairs between strings and pulling them out?  I have a Stila liquid eyeliner that's sort of like a wet eyeliner marker/brush- the tips look pretty similar- do they work the same way?  I sometimes practice by doing some eyeliner before getting into the shower or otherwise just washing away the shaaaame. (I can do the lines fairly straight, but one of these days will figure out how to make my eyes not look like tiny circles after adding the eyeliner. They don't without it!)"
RandomActsofMakeup,35jdme,To_each_their_0wn,2,Thu May 14 15:53:12 2015 UTC,Yeah the Stila one is pretty similar!    And that's exactly how threading works. You could also get your brows waxed instead. I have almost no eyebrows but j know a lot of girls like to get their eyebrows done once or twice a year and then just take care of the upkeep with tweezers.

RandomActsofMakeup,35h3df,SmartAleck08,4,Sun May 10 08:02:19 2015 UTC,"I've been extremely stressed out lately. I'm dealing with a bunch of family drama right now. My Mom and stepdad are having troubles, and it's falling back on me even though I don't even live with them because my Mom has asked me if she could move in with me if things get too bad. It makes me sad because he's one of the few guys she's dated that I really liked and he treats her well; they're both just so hard headed they can't concede in disagreements and it causes such stupid drama. I wish I could shake my mother, but I'm the 'kid' so I don't know what I'm talking about.  Furthermore, I was trying to get my student loans in order so I could go back to school, but they're insistent that I pay on them for another 10 months before I'm even eligible for more loans and/or deferment. And they based the payments on my income, meaning I'm paying in much more than I was originally. Enough so that it's actually hurting my budget. But I can't let them fall behind because I need to get them paid enough to finish the rest of my degree. Taking a year off was not as relaxing as I had hoped it would be.  I hate my job. It's so stressful and it's customer service intensive. Lately I've been getting the customers where nothing is ever good enough and I can't make them happy and am therefore the worst person on the planet. I had a guy yell at me yesterday and storm out of the building for calmly telling him I didn't appreciate the way he was speaking to me. I have the highest customer satisfaction rating of any employee in my location for 3 months running, so I know I should let these people not hurt me, but I pride myself on the job I do and the service I give...  And this may sound stupid, but I feel like all the familiar faces here are gone. I'm not here as much lately working 40+ hours a week and attempting to still have a social life (ha), and now when I come around I don't recognize anyone. I love new faces, but I miss the people who were here when I first joined. They all used to post regularly and it felt like RAoM was part of my family because we all knew each other pretty well. Now I feel like a stranger in a place that used to be my getaway. Sorry for the long whiny post I just wanted to talk to someone other than my SO about everything going on right now."

I've definitely had the Quasimodo type thing going on, and it's annoying because the swelling takes awhile to go down.  I don't know if you had an allergic reaction to an ingredient or the environment, so I'd suggest taking it slow and safe.  I'd skip eye makeup tonight and probably even for several days after. See how you are doing, if your general allergies are acting up at all, etc.  Then I'd start using one product at a time. I know that you are used to your eye makeup so this might be annoying, but it is the best way to play it. You won't be able to figure out if you're reacting to anything if you put it all on again at the same time. Maybe try just mascara one day, then if that goes okay try that with eyeliner, then if that goes okay try it with eyeshadow, etc.  If you have any issues, go back to nothing and talk to your doctor.  Use the time to get out of your comfort zone and experiment with other things like perfecting your no makeup makeup look, or a bold lip, or anything else!"

If you are not actually completely clear of it, using the mascara wand now and then again later might make it come back or worse, spread to your other eye. Anything you used during its incubation period (3 days before would be a safe bet) might need to be properly sterilized/thrown out. Remember, you can't really sterilize mascara but you can with your brushes/eyeliners.   Just try to be safe so it doesn't come back!!"

I posted this recently on another subreddit, but I recently went to buy blush for the first time.  The employee swatched two on my hand and said they both looked good.

When I asked about seeing some others, she then suggested that I use color correcting primer.

RandomActsofMakeup,356fet,minxual,1 point,Thu May 7 17:42:09 2015 UTC,"I, too, had trouble with the NYX concealer pots - I've since switched to MAC's Pro Longwear Concealer ($20). I was having a lot of trouble with the skin under my eyes being oily, and my concealer was really caking into my fine lines and making me look like an ancient crone - I haven't had that problem with this concealer. :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,356fet,minxual,2,Thu May 7 14:53:24 2015 UTC,Yes! But that little bit of skin us usually only oily after I work. It's more like immediately while applying it cakes and settled in my lines then just looked spotted. I will see if I can get a sample of the concealer.

RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,koiotchka,10,Thu May 7 02:51:17 2015 UTC,I use baby oil! Then cleanse with cerave foaming cleanser. Then I moisturize!   Shout out to /r/skincareaddiction.
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,JessBS27,2,Thu May 7 03:36:55 2015 UTC,My routine exactly :) Works great!
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,AlaskanFeesh,3,Thu May 7 04:46:29 2015 UTC,I agree! Using makeup remover pads never does enough for me! I always feel like there's stuff left over. Plus I've definitely had allergic reactions to some pads. Nothing beats baby oil! It's even cheap.
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,JessBS27,1 point,Thu May 7 04:53:31 2015 UTC,"Do they make unscented baby oil?  I will look at the store today :)  Is ""cerave"" a brand or a category?"
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,JessBS27,1 point,Thu May 7 11:56:45 2015 UTC,"You may want to consider plain old vitamin E oil, in that case! That's all baby oil is. Or else they may have unscented/sensitive. To be honest, I haven't had to search!   Cerave is the brand! They have two cleaners. One is foaming and the other is hydrating. Foaming is the way to go after using the baby oil/vitamin E oil on your face."
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,hendricks1212,1 point,Thu May 7 12:03:24 2015 UTC,I love using baby oil as well.  I actually skip the regular cleanser afterward and just let the baby oil absorb works great for my aging skin. OCM is great.
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,JessBS27,1 point,Thu May 7 10:55:30 2015 UTC,This sounds wonderfully simple and like something I could actually manage to make myself do on a regular basis :)
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,hendricks1212,1 point,Thu May 7 11:57:24 2015 UTC,What's the rest of your routine? I thought you had to cleanse after!
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,JessBS27,1 point,Thu May 7 12:05:09 2015 UTC,You don't have to.  I remove my make with a lot of oil and then I wipe it off with lukewarm water thoroughly.  Once it feels like all the residual cleaning oil is absorbed I put on a moisturizer.  Many people prefer to use a soap after and it probably helps those who are more acne prone.  I am not at all acne prone and so my overall goal is maintenance of my moisture barrier.  EDIT I forgot the rest of my routine for morning.  That is my evening routine.  In the morning I wash with a daily face cleanser ( I like neutrogena) with SA and then use a moisturizer with SPF in it and allow that to settle on my face before starting my make up.
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,hendricks1212,1 point,Thu May 7 14:54:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much! I am very acne prone. But since I've focused on hydration, my skin has improved a lot! So maybe it'd be worth a shot! Thank you so much for your routine."
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,hendricks1212,1 point,Thu May 7 16:01:41 2015 UTC,"This is so great, thank you for sharing your routines :D  What does ""with SA"" mean?"
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,chicky08tink,1 point,Fri May 8 01:30:55 2015 UTC,Salicylic Acid.  You see this or AHA (Alpha Hydroxyacid).  Overall chemical exfoliation is considered better and more effective than physical exfoliation by the r/skincareaddiction subreddit.  Physical exfoliation can leave micro damage to the skin and actually allow bacteria to find way in deeper.  I added stridex (red box) to my teenage daughter's routine to help her hormonal acne (puberty sucks).  It really makes a difference when she is consistence with it but I swear she would forget her head if it wasn't attached.    Head over the the r/skincareaddiction sidebar for some good info.
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,chicky08tink,1 point,Fri May 8 01:44:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you :D  Salicylic acid is the stuff in willow bark aka aspirin, isn't it?  I wonder if some sort of willow bark rinse would be useful (I drink willow bark tea to help with fibromyalgia, so I have some on hand), or if that would...  not be useful.  I hadn't thought about physical exfoliation giving bacteria a pathway, but it makes sense.  I will go read the /r/skincareaddiction sidebar, thank you :D"
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,GunTonic,1 point,Fri May 8 11:49:38 2015 UTC,"yup the same acid as in aspirin however formulated aspirin typically is acetylsalicylic acid a prodrug and the SA is a metabolite.  As far as trying to make your own from willow bark I wouldn't know how to make something that was the most effective strength.  While fun to do as a chemistry lab, I would hesitate to put it directly on my skin without know the exact concentration."
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,To_each_their_0wn,1 point,Fri May 8 20:41:18 2015 UTC,That makes sense too.  I will look into it...  see if any herbalists have something similar.
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,Rocha_999,2,Fri May 8 21:33:17 2015 UTC,"Hi! It really depends on your routine and skin. /r/skincareaddiction has a lot of great tips for making sure your skin is clean and healthy. For me, if I am able to, I use an oil-based makeup remover (clinique's take the day off or the one from lush). If I am in a rush or overall lazy, I just use makeup wipes (I generally don't feel like they remove everything so that's why I only use them when I'm feeling lazy). The important thing is that you remember to take it off at the end of the day and not sleep with the makeup on!   In terms of natural, A lot of people like using baby oil or coconut oil to remove makeup and it seems to work pretty well. I would always advice that after you do your cleansing, go through your usual moisturizing routine to keep everything healthy and well-balanced."
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,Rocha_999,2,Thu May 7 03:03:21 2015 UTC,"Coconut oil!  I will try that :)  I don't have a moisturizing routine -- I don't really have any skincare or makeup related routines yet, really.  So um...  I don't really know what to do there either.  I will check out /r/skincareaddiction :)"

But since you are putting a lot more stuff on your face than usual, it might be good to incorporate some stuff to make sure your skin is balanced :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,stargoslaby,2,Thu May 7 03:15:48 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking -- all the makeup is surely going to, I dunno, upset the skin a little bit or something.  It seems sensible to incorporate some way of returning the skin to normal, or giving it a boost if possible.  So I will have to build a skincare routine :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,354tsw,rycheme,1 point,Thu May 7 11:51:05 2015 UTC,I second the coconut oil. I use it all the time and it smells great too. I  use it for a DIY lip scrub too - a little sugar and coconut oil. It is just a really good multitasker.
RandomActsofMakeup,355k4b,Rocha_999,3,Thu May 7 08:02:22 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone. How do you go about deciding what blush and lipstick go well together? Similar undertones right, and not overpowering/clashing with each other? I always just go for a really natural looking blush if I'm wearing a colourful lipstick; or vice versa - if I want to use a brighter blush then I use a MLBB lipstick."
RandomActsofMakeup,355k4b,roseatesg,1 point,Thu May 7 11:23:48 2015 UTC,Same here! If I am wearing a bright bold lipstick I will opt for a really natural blush. It's best to focus on one point of the face otherwise it might be too overwhelming and look overdone.

I've been gone away from the subreddit for the last few months (just busy with school) and would peek at it every so often, but have been admittedly rather absent.  It seems like participation in this sub has decreased dramatically, which (if true) is really disappointing.  When I was more involved in the sub, I recall seeing the ""current contests & giveaways"" list being staggeringly long. The Weekly Vent and Share threads had hundreds of comments, but last week's had less than 10 a piece.   There was a collection of users who posted every day and got pretty close IIRC. If that group had a falling out or else collectively faded away from the sub, I can imagine that distorting my perceptions.   Am I imagining this? Did something big happen and I missed it?

The downside to ordering now is that they just had their 5 year anniversary sale, so it might take a little longer than usual for the stuff to ship.

The second one seems like it has a better combinations of colors. I have skin slightly lighter than you and for me the colors on the first one, some of them didn't show up as well. You do seem to have a good variety on neutrals though already in your collection so the only nice thing would be that pop of blue on the second one but the lorac 2 has a pop of blue as well.   Whatever you do though, check out noveaucheap.com's blog. She posted a sale recently about getting the second chocolate bar palette on HSN for $29 and free shipping.

RandomActsofMakeup,34w2cq,roseatesg,1 point,Tue May 5 02:23:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the only 2 things I've decided are HG for me are  Cover Girl Lash Blast Mascara and Maybelline 24 hr. Color Stay lipsticks. Everything else I am still trying to find the perfect thing. I'm really enjoying the Tarte Amazonian Clay Foundation but I think I bought a slightly wrong color and for $42 a pop I want to use every drop before I try again.   What about for you?"
RandomActsofMakeup,34w2cq,mustachemouse,2,Tue May 5 02:28:38 2015 UTC,The CLIO Kill Black eyeliner is my favourite liquid eyeliner! It's a lot more affordable than the Stila one and it works well for Asian eyes :-) The Tarte Amazonian Clay is one of my favourite foundations too!
RandomActsofMakeup,34w2cq,purpleandglitter,1 point,Tue May 5 02:33:14 2015 UTC,"I'll have to look that eyeliner up! The one I use the most is some like $2 dollar store one. It's not the greatest, only because I have watery eyes and it fades, but it works pretty well for wings."

RandomActsofMakeup,34ud6e,Cameo-Illustrated,1 point,Wed May 6 03:18:39 2015 UTC,Advice? The thing is. It won't change in one day. Practice is key. Also: good tools. A blending brush and a standard eye shadow brush. I also use the smudge brush by essence a lot! (In my crease).  I also feel like good products are the key. Wet n wild for a more budget friendly eyeshadow. But urban decay and Lorac for splurges.   Practice will make perfect!! It took me almost 2 years to get to where I am now. (I admit I didn't practice every day or multiple times a day).

Urban Decay Naked3 palette; Dust, Burnout, Limit, Buz, Nooner, Liar, Blackheart.  I wrote the whole product list out on my blog. But I am SO bad at keeping it up. But those are the colors that I used. Sin is the beautiful color that is in the middle."

Then, he asked about the front pockets, which I started laughing so hard and said, ""What front pockets?"". And showed him two keys that I managed to fit in my front pockets   So yes, my best friend learned girl pockets are bull and having actual deep pockets in girl's clothing is lie.

However, the biggest gripe that people have with glittery shadows are that it doesnt give the dimension that they want. Glitter/shimmer shadows are great for inner corners or lids, but to get the deep look of a smokey eye you want a matte for the crease and outer corner. Mattes also define the eye a bit more while shimmers/glitters just kinda melt the look into a big mess of shine."

I think what's on my hair right now are Pink Fetish Rose, Lusty Lavender, and whatever they call their turquoise.  Splat comes with bleach, and the dyes are semi-permanent so I usually don't worry about toner.  The rainbow look right now was done on top of a head full of faded out Pink Fetish Rose and a couple of inches of untreated roots, without bleaching.  And it still turned out properly purple and blue.  That's why I love Splat and haven't used anything else in a couple of years :)  Thank you for the compliment, that helps my confidence :D  I will keep learning!"

RandomActsofMakeup,34p8o4,texas_star,2,Sun May 3 23:30:57 2015 UTC,Yesterday I heard about a bluebell wood near my house and I told my husband about how I wish I could go so badly. well today he out my wheelchair in the car and said my illness shouldn't stop me from living. I took all of my meds and thanks to my new neuro meds I actually managed to walk a little bit of the way with my cane :) this is a big deal to me at the moment and the woods were magical! My toddler had the best time exploring and seeing the carpet of blue :) it was the perfect day! And as we were heading back to the car we saw a deer in a clearing! It saw us and pegged it before I could get my camera out but it just made it so much more magical :) I feel like today I won over my illness and I'm so glad I am making some progress! Hopefully next year when the bluebells return I'll be wheelchair free :)

RandomActsofMakeup,34mxt9,purpleandglitter,2,Sat May 2 20:47:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly I did have this problem at first, but it was because I had touched my lips together before they completely dried. Usually I leave my mouth open slightly while  my lips dry in order to keep them from becoming sticky, it also makes it look a bit patchy if you rub your lips together on initial application. I know that's the first thing we always want to do, but I strongly  suggest against it."

RandomActsofMakeup,34kcko,deltacharlie82,3,Fri May 1 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"Some bronzers are more cool toned, which make them better suited for contouring because you want your contour to look like a shadow. I would say a bronzer like Hoola is cool enough to do so.   Makeup is all about expressing yourself, so if you like using a shimmery bronzer for contouring, go ahead! But if you want to make your cheekbones to be more prominent a cool toned contour powder or bronzer is the way to go."
RandomActsofMakeup,34kcko,lipsticksx,1 point,Fri May 1 23:05:37 2015 UTC,"I started with elf bronzing powder because it was cheap. Now I have the smash box conturing powder kit.   To be honest I don't think theres much of an actual difference in terms of what they are, theres just more of a difference in quality in brands. I think bronzers tend to be a bit shiny where as conturing looks more like a shadow. But some bronzers aren't shiny.   Conturing powder I think is easier to blend. I really don't think theres much difference though.   Im not helpful am I?"
RandomActsofMakeup,34kcko,LinzDarling,1 point,Fri May 1 23:03:44 2015 UTC,"I thin k contour powder is usually cooler toned and matte. I use a matte 'bronzer' as a transition, then use my contour color. so it goes from my warm-toned skin, to warm-toned darker (shadow edge), to cool-toned contour shadow. But hey, my contour color is NYX Blush in Taupe, so anything goes if you can make it work!"

For Mac, I don't really like the quality of their shadows (they just don't work on me!) but I absolutely adore their loose pigments.

I highly recomend their brand new 12 pan pallettes on sephora's website, they have a neutral and a brights pallette and they. are. awesome !!   If drugstore is more your style, Makeup Geek is great and so are the Wet & Wild trios.

I have the brights one because I do not need more neutrals (not that I need more brights either...) and it's so pretty.   Have you tried the MUG foiled shadows or just the regular ones? I love both but feel like the regular shadows are probably more useful as workhorses than just pops of color.

Add in a few fillers like Magnesium Stearate (and others) to make them smooth in texture and kaolin clay to help with adhesion. Its somewhat time consuming but fun nonetheless.  Then if I so choose, mix in micas to add some shimmer (although not required). I much prefer matte shades."

I knit and make jewelry a lot, but that isn't very interesting.  We were required to decorate our walls in ""Gallery Wall"" style this year, so I made a color Polaroid wall and 2 canvases. I didn't actually have a paint color that was the same as my comforter, so I had to mix 4 different paints to make a giant batch the proper color to cover both. The monogram took a while to design, but was quick to make. The chevron pearl trident was a bitch. The chevron took SO MANY calculations and I still messed up. The painters tape didn't work well. I had to use a cotton swab because I didn't have a small enough paint brush to fix it. And then I broke my glue gun and bought a new one, which turns out was ""high heat"" so I got 2nd degree burns.

RandomActsofMakeup,34fxhi,glittergash,3,Fri May 1 02:10:37 2015 UTC,"You might want to start with a green-based primer to cancel out the redness. MAC, Smashbox and Makeup Forever have great green primers. I think NYX does, too. Green will cancel out the redness so your skin is neutralized, which will then make it a better base for foundations. Ideally try to stay within brand (i.e. MAC primer, MAC foundation), but you'll have to experiment a little bit with what works for you. You should take a trip (even if it's a couple hours away) to a mall where you can visit makeup counters and a Sephora to get swatched and even pick up some samples before purchasing anything. Once you nail down the best product combination, then you can order online.    Also, make sure you are taking good care of your skin."
RandomActsofMakeup,34fxhi,LinzDarling,3,Fri May 1 01:53:53 2015 UTC,"Go get your Color IQ from Sephora. Its free and they use a device that takes 3 close up pictues of your skin. One picture from your forehead, cheek and neck. Then it pulls up all the colors in the store that you match. Then you can filter your results by how much coverage you want.   I did over a month ago and this is probably the first time in my life my foundation completely matches and doesn't look ridiculous."
RandomActsofMakeup,34fxhi,LinzDarling,3,Thu Apr 30 20:37:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion! Only problem is that I live literally in the middle of nowhere and the nearest Sephora location is over two hours away. :(

RandomActsofMakeup,34fxhi,Mrs_C_W,3,Fri May 1 03:59:13 2015 UTC,Face and Body is actually the lightest coverage foundation because it has the most water content of all MAC's foundations.

I've noticed a change in the morning by not putting my face under the shower stream directly (I use my hands to soften the stream if I really need to get soap off my forehead or something), taking less hot showers, and then just washing my face quickly with lukewarm water at the sink afterwards. Have you thought about changing your cleanser and moisturizer? That might help with the redness too. I use CeraVe foaming cleanser but they also make a hydrating.  On the make-up front, I use Revlon Photoready Concealer and Everyday Minerals powder foundation. I've heard Meow cosmetics powder foundation is also really great (they have light, medium, and heavy coverage formulas) which I'm going to test out soon.  Good luck! :)"

RandomActsofMakeup,34bz6c,Kayleemarie1994,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:53:30 2015 UTC,I used the Itsjudytime palette for this look :)
RandomActsofMakeup,34bz6c,Kayleemarie1994,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:56:18 2015 UTC,"Well, looks like that's going on my wishlist! How pigmented are the shadows without a primer or base? :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,34bz6c,Kayleemarie1994,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"It was a limited edition palette and they no longer sell it :( They had it on hautelook yesterday but it was sold out by the time I heard the news :( I'm so bummed out for not having a back up. I really love this palette, the shadows last all day even without a primer. They are also very pigmented on their own but having a base makes them really last forever on the eyes and it really enhances the colors."

RandomActsofMakeup,34cs0r,Darushi-chan,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:00:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I actually wore it a few days ago. I decided on this look because on top of feeling really great about it, my boyfriend said ""I don't know what you did different, but that's the best lipstick on you."" If he noticed, it must be good!"
RandomActsofMakeup,34cs0r,ka_hime,2,Thu Apr 30 14:45:26 2015 UTC,If at possible you may want to use makeup that is already sold in Sephora.  That way if you're asked about your look you can talk about the products and show how you would sell them instore if hired.
RandomActsofMakeup,34cs0r,ka_hime,3,Thu Apr 30 14:21:17 2015 UTC,That is a great idea! Unfortunately there's only drugstore makeup available in my region so I  can only work with what I currently have. This is the first Sephora that's ever been in my regions and I am SO excited to try new brands.
RandomActsofMakeup,34cs0r,ka_hime,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:47:38 2015 UTC,"I used to work there and don't worry, I don't recall any of the interviews I had or my friend had where they asked what we were wearing. I remember being called the MAC girl for so long because my Store Director knew I was wearing their pigments/shadows/lipsticks.  Once hired, just come in a bit early to find something similar in color in case you get asked by a client :)  Also, your choice of makeup is fine! I remember tons of girls not even wearing anything when coming into an interview and after being hired on -.-"

RandomActsofMakeup,34bd9s,klady,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:52:47 2015 UTC,I just found them on Amazon! Here is a link to one. All three of them came from the same seller. I noticed that the paint chipped off a little bit but it's not enough to bother me. Hope that helps! :)

What kind of brushes do you use to blend? Thanks for doing this tutorial!"
RandomActsofMakeup,3479ft,ZeeFishy,5,Wed Apr 29 02:55:43 2015 UTC,Uhhh.... I used my fingers for all of it except the powders. I use 8 year old eco tool brushes. Lol
RandomActsofMakeup,3479ft,dorothy_zbornak_esq,3,Wed Apr 29 02:59:37 2015 UTC,Daaaang. I can't contour with a brush to save my life...guess I'm going to try with my fingers next time.
RandomActsofMakeup,3479ft,CaptainCatbee,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:09:27 2015 UTC,"I actually just gave up applying it with a brush, like, last week, I couldn't figure it out at all. I'd like to have one of those beauty blender thingies, maybe that would work best."
RandomActsofMakeup,3479ft,A5H13Y,2,Wed Apr 29 03:12:09 2015 UTC,"Cream contour stuff is a little tricky, it took a few trials and errors before I got this far. I'm positive there is much more room for improvement."
RandomActsofMakeup,3479ft,A5H13Y,4,Wed Apr 29 03:03:20 2015 UTC,"Great post! I am still learning how to contour my giant melon head, and I didn't know about the jawline contour! Also I hate watching videos (weird I know) so I appreciate the step by step pics. You're adorable and kickass!"
RandomActsofMakeup,3479ft,pokebecka,2,Wed Apr 29 03:25:36 2015 UTC,Thank you! I also hate watching videos. I don't really know why.
RandomActsofMakeup,3479ft,pokebecka,3,Wed Apr 29 05:10:05 2015 UTC,My only real cc: the concealer (and especially the white shadow) around your brows looks awesome in natural light but is really really obvious when you go inside (at least that's how it looks on the camera). If you're going somewhere you'll be indoors it might work better to use the same concealer that was above your brows on both sides and then use a lighter nude to set the bottom. The contour blending looks awesome though!!!
RandomActsofMakeup,3479ft,pokebecka,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:51:20 2015 UTC,I think I will try this. Thank you! :)
RandomActsofMakeup,3479ft,Airship_Captain,6,Wed Apr 29 05:07:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, wow, very nice! The only CC I have is to just be careful about the concealer around your eyebrows. I'm not a fan of the whole ""highlighted"" eyebrows thing - and if it is done, it should be as subtle/unnoticeable as possible. In your later pics it looked completely fine, but I don't know if it was just the lighting in those because you could really see the white in the pics right after you did it."
RandomActsofMakeup,3479ft,Caitir,2,Wed Apr 29 13:22:44 2015 UTC,"Part of that was definitely lighting, but also I was a little heavy with too light of a concealer. It's a work in progress, right? :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,3479ft,cuppycaek,4,Wed Apr 29 13:35:39 2015 UTC,"Right, this is how we all become makeup pros though, posting and asking for CC! Everything else seemed pretty dead-on too, so you're basically amazing haha"
RandomActsofMakeup,3479ft,hearinghands,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:43:33 2015 UTC,"XD Oh, you! Thanks, though. It took about two years of lurking in all the makeup subs. Ha!"
RandomActsofMakeup,3479ft,CaptainCoral,6,Wed Apr 29 14:00:45 2015 UTC,THANK YOU for this! PS... I love the double nose ring and the shape of your lips!
RandomActsofMakeup,3479ft,justfrank63,2,Wed Apr 29 01:32:13 2015 UTC,You are very welcome. It's so hard to find good makeup tutorials for plus sized gals because not all of us have round faces.   Thank you! Those nose rings are about 10 years apart from each other! I love them! I'm also pretty keen on my lips. :)
RandomActsofMakeup,3479ft,savageroots,2,Wed Apr 29 01:53:14 2015 UTC,I know! I always see contouring tutorials but they don't work on my face shape. My face shape seems very similar to yours!

RandomActsofMakeup,348rjn,LinzDarling,3,Wed Apr 29 04:55:26 2015 UTC,"I just wear 'em =).   If I am being a little more subtle I will use neutral on top with a color pop on bottom. It works with colored eyeliner, but I enjoy doing it was a white eyeliner base, then using an angle brush to pack on color shadow. The picture is crap, but thats actually a gradient of colors. I also might do bright lid color with neutral highlight and crease."

RandomActsofMakeup,348rjn,CrossedWires,3,Sun May 3 19:15:51 2015 UTC,I smudge them into my lower lashline while wearing neutral shadows for the rest of the look.
RandomActsofMakeup,348rjn,roseatesg,2,Wed Apr 29 17:30:17 2015 UTC,Yes! I do wear fun colours when I'm in the mood for it. Sometimes I'd wear a dual eyeliner look - Blue + Black liner | Pink + Black liner   Other times I'd just go all out and wear orange shadow!  You can also try wearing a bright pop of colour in your waterline~ You can try this look out!
RandomActsofMakeup,348rjn,CaptainCatbee,2,Wed Apr 29 05:57:10 2015 UTC,Yes! Thats awesome thank you so much!
RandomActsofMakeup,348rjn,hearinghands,2,Wed Apr 29 09:36:36 2015 UTC,Dual liner is my favorite way to do a pop of color! It's my favorite way to use my blues.

RandomActsofMakeup,348rjn,MyKindOfLullaby,2,Wed Apr 29 22:39:38 2015 UTC,For me brights work the best used sparingly in my outer v or confined to the crease. It's different than how most people use them but it works for me.
RandomActsofMakeup,348rjn,midnighteskye,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:20:16 2015 UTC,I always wear fun colors in my crease because my eyeballs are so big. I look like a clown if I try to incorporate the colors anywhere else haha. It sort of looks like this although I don't bring the color in toward my nose so much.   So normally I'll do a sort of neutral smokey eye like this and add whatever color I want in the crease in the corner and blend it with the black eyeshadow. I can do a look for you if you want since my explanation seems a little confusing haha.

Apparently, I have no self control over anything $5 or less XD I honestly dont even play my PSP really anymore since buying my Vita :/"

RandomActsofMakeup,3489lx,princessbubbleguum,2,Wed Apr 29 03:04:35 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what a catbug is.  But I used to have restraint, I used to be able to look at beauty products and think that I have a similar shade so I don't need that one.  Then I found indie perfumes. I now have like 5 different coffee scents, one that'll make me smell like fresh cut grass, one that smells like a storm, one that smells like old books...  I just started buying like 3 weeks ago. ): I could go outside and just smell fresh cut grass... but it's much easier to sniff a perfume."
RandomActsofMakeup,3489lx,Sixkitties,2,Wed Apr 29 03:11:02 2015 UTC,catbug  Most recent impulse buy? Probably my Kat Von D Everlasting Liquid Lipstick. Probably my best impulse buy too because it's fabuloussss.
RandomActsofMakeup,3489lx,mustachemouse,2,Wed Apr 29 03:11:09 2015 UTC,Catbug my ways to use self control.... hmm I would say that I just remind myself about my monetary goals (saving up to move! ) so I just say to myself to write it down and get it once I have moved and have saved up $x.xx in my account. :)
RandomActsofMakeup,3489lx,stargoslaby,2,Wed Apr 29 03:16:57 2015 UTC,Catbug!  My most recent impulse buy was the Beauty Blender.  I've read loads of good stuff about it and when I finally purchased my liquid foundation I decided to pick it up as well.
RandomActsofMakeup,3489lx,Darushi-chan,2,Wed Apr 29 03:17:12 2015 UTC,"My most recent splurge was the duchess collection in minis from Hello Waffle, I have been DYING to get my hands on those mattes, and I love me a good Archer reference. Sorry no impulse-control advice here  oh and CATBUG"

I keep a wishlist and try to only buy from it when there's a sale (40% drugstore, ~20% other). I think another huge part about not impulse buying is to appreciate what you already have. (If I buy lipstick x now, I won't get to use lipstick y as much.)"

RandomActsofMakeup,344j8b,kulikulikuwaha,2,Tue Apr 28 06:14:11 2015 UTC,I think this really warms up your skin tone in a good way. It gives you a pretty glow (: I've been wanting to get the abh cream kit but i never see them anywhere in stores so I'm scared to order it online since i can't try it out first ): i have their original contour kit and i love it but I'm worried the cream would be chalky or goopy on my skin since i have dry skin. what did you think of it??
RandomActsofMakeup,344j8b,emeraldtheging,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:28:40 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love it. However, if you have dry skin the most important step is to prep with a moisturizer. Also, you can add a few drops of face oil (I prefer Tarte's maracuja oil) either directly onto the cream or onto the back of your hand to swirl your blending brush/sponge in. If you buy it online and don't like it, you can return it at any Macy's tbh. Just make sure there's no proof that you purchasedit anywhere else. If you get it from Macy's online you can get a full refund, but if you get it elsewhere you can only get store credit."
RandomActsofMakeup,344j8b,emeraldtheging,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:28:54 2015 UTC,Oh wow this response was so full of good advice lol. This is a completely different question but do you think I could return a coach perfume set I got for my birthday? I want nothing to do with it but they didn't give me a gift receipt. Do you think they'll take it?
RandomActsofMakeup,344j8b,jorathin7,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:51:20 2015 UTC,"With Macy's, unless you have one of the return stickers or a receipt, theyll just give you store credit. Just make sure that they sell it! As long as one Macy's store sells the item, you can return it at any location. As long as the box isnt totally damaged you'll be fine."

RandomActsofMakeup,3418ty,soopaaflii,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:20:03 2015 UTC,Nice find. How is the quality? I've heard the Forever 21 blush palette and this palette are the same thing.
RandomActsofMakeup,3418ty,Queen_C_,2,Mon Apr 27 15:23:55 2015 UTC,I have the CS blush palette. They're like silk. Go on very smoothly. Very pigmented as well so a little goes a long way and it can be sheer to opaque with how you apply. My biggest suggestion would be to try every color before you just slap them on. I though one looked purplish in the palette.... It came out very pink on me.
RandomActsofMakeup,3418ty,minxual,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:55:11 2015 UTC,"I really like it! The pigment is pretty amazing, considering the price. They don't seem chalky at all, and are really soft when swatched. I have yet to use it on my face, but I will report back!"

RandomActsofMakeup,33zqum,chicky08tink,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:37:44 2015 UTC,I've been on a no buy since January so that I could save up for foundation. Ive just been sampling at work 😂😂. But we finally had a 40% for employees sale so I decided to buy now.
RandomActsofMakeup,33zqum,chicky08tink,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:54:08 2015 UTC,Oh man that's nice though! I'm currently looking for a good foundation for my wedding and it's going to suck to bite the bullet and pay for it but at least it will be worth it.
RandomActsofMakeup,33zqum,purpleandglitter,2,Mon Apr 27 14:22:12 2015 UTC,"If you're just looking for something for your wedding, go to sephora or Macy's, find the one, and just take a sample of it. The jars will generally last you at the very least two applications, can go up to ten. That way you dont have to get one for one day."
RandomActsofMakeup,33zqum,purpleandglitter,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:25:06 2015 UTC,I thought about that but my skin tends to look very different as the day goes on with my foundation so I prefer to buy it. I had been looking for another foundation for summer anyways so it's not that big of a deal. I did get some samples from sephora and those usually last me 3-4 applications but I prefer to buy the big bottle
RandomActsofMakeup,33zqum,minxual,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:36:54 2015 UTC,"Great haul! Where was it from, I need good samples in my life!"

RandomActsofMakeup,33xccm,MyKindOfLullaby,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:06:13 2015 UTC,"Hm I guess it depends on what is ""a lot""! You wil most likely keep the darker line throughout the rubbing so it's just a case of re applying the base colour. You could try only using the base colour and a highlight and see how that goes?"
RandomActsofMakeup,33xccm,MyKindOfLullaby,2,Sun Apr 26 17:16:30 2015 UTC,"This definitely calls for a test run! Do you wear these looks all day? I know it depends on the products used, but how long do they typically last for you?"
RandomActsofMakeup,33xccm,LinzDarling,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:21:53 2015 UTC,If I use liquid to matte then it lasts all day but is much more dramatic. This look with these products I need to touch up the base colour after around 4 hours and just keep track of it after eating and drinking :)

I just... don't know what to say/think, and I'm still having trouble processing it. She was in her 60's, and I met her at work. She was a fantastic friend/mentor; even though we had over a 35 year age difference between us, it didn't seem like she was an older person, y'know? Then I moved to a different building, but still for the same employer, so we still communicated a lot and saw each other outside of work.

It's not exactly unpleasant but I really don't love it. Are there any products that you guys have gotten that you just really don't like the smell?

I would try maybe using a concealer on that raised part of skin and bring your lip color (on the bottom) more inward to make the bottom lip appear smaller.   Just something you might try out. I'm definitely not a professional.  Edit: might try drawing if that didn't make sense."
RandomActsofMakeup,33pjp3,Yellowbir,2,Fri Apr 24 18:39:58 2015 UTC,"I'll try that out for sure, but every under drawing method looks so weirdly obvious on me because my lips are very projected(?) from the rest of my face, and they're hard to conceal because they're rather pigmented.

RandomActsofMakeup,33pjp3,To_each_their_0wn,2,Fri Apr 24 18:43:04 2015 UTC,"Product list  Base:  Primer and brows: Rimmel's fix and perfect pro primer mixed with a dab of NYX hd concealer in green. Brows are Anastasia Dipbrow Pomade in ebony.   Foundation: A mix of 3CE Back To Baby BB cream, NARS sheer glow in Siberia and NARS all day luminous weightless foundation in Gobi  Highlight/contour/setting powder: NARS Blush In Albatross, elf bronzer, and too faced candlelight setting powder.   The Rest:  Eyes: UD primer potion, too faced natural eyes palette. I used the copper and gold shade, blended together with heaven as a base. Too faced better than sex for mascara.   Lips: NYX lip liner in ""natural"", KVD liquid lipstick in ""never and forever"" and soap and glory's ""a great kisser"" for the glossy look.   some notes   I always struggle with a clean lip application, and I'm working on it but it's a rough battle. I also think my lipline just makes my lips look overdrawn, because the center is much more raised and defined than the outer ridges. Underlining looks weird as hell though. Cc and tips are always welcome, and not just for lip application :)"

I lovelovelove your natural brow shape, and it might just be my preference, but I use a shadow a shade lighter than my eyebrows and fill in the patchy areas/make a more defined line.   Youtube has some really great tutorials for brows depending on your style/shape.   I have used waxes, gels, pencils, powders - gels and powders are my favorite.   Optional, because it takes practice - contouring. Invest in a bronzer/foundation a shade darker than normal. Use the darker shade underneath your cheekbones (make a super pucker kissy face and youll see that hollow area). That is where you add darker shades. Then other areas like your hairline, the sides of your temples, the sides of your nose and jawline.   Additionally, reverse contouring will highlight areas. The areas most people highlight are inner corner of the eye (tear duct), below  the brow (directly below). The highest part of your cheekbone, some people do below the eyes and to the nose in a triangle shape, forehead, cupids bow and chin.   This takes a lot more effort and I dont always do it everyday. Youre getting the basics down for your face shape and from there you can experiment and branch out into new techniques and find what works best for you."

It sounds like a lot of people do advise trimming them quite short, but I can see the problem you're referring to because you're still left with curly hairs. Have you tried any sort of brow wax? Like maybe comb them, wax, comb again if you need to, try brow gel on top?  My other thought was using some sort of straightening hair product on them. Like a cream or something, after you shower and prior to doing your makeup. I have no idea if that would work, these are just the things I would try if I had the same issue."

RandomActsofMakeup,33ir1s,Yellowbir,4,Wed Apr 22 21:14:56 2015 UTC,"If you're trying to brighten up your eyes, I'd put a concealer that's a shade lighter than your skin tone underneath your eyes. I sort of put it in a triangle shape that extends down the sides of my nose and diagonally upwards, if you can picture that? It really helps to brighten up my face. If you're going to wear the eyeliner, which looks nice, I'd suggest a mascara with it. I really brings the focus to the eyes, which is what I think you're going for :)  I know you didn't ask specifically, but with your blush try blending it upwards when applying it. Otherwise it tends to weigh your face down and look heavy instead of highlighting your features."
RandomActsofMakeup,33ir1s,wolawizard,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:25:56 2015 UTC,Okay:D I'll try this tormorrow
RandomActsofMakeup,33ir1s,SEXY_SEA_CREATURE,4,Thu Apr 23 03:07:19 2015 UTC,"You have great skin, first off! I agree with the other user about your blush placement; it's a bit too low on your face and maybe too close to your nose. Pull it up and back!  As for your eyes, the liner looks heavy to me. Have you tried just doing an all over shadow color and mascara? Something like a soft brown or shimmery nude would make you look more awake and still look very natural."
RandomActsofMakeup,33ir1s,Bumbleonia,2,Wed Apr 22 23:57:31 2015 UTC,"A thousand times yes on the blush placement. Its the simplest of all the recommendations and will really change her face shape.   To OP: You have those difficult hooded eyes just like me and that really changes the way eyeliner/eye shadow looks. For an everyday look I would stick to lighter shades of browns, greys and neutrals with a thinner line and maybe wing it out a little bit.   And, I am NO makeup artist, just learning as I go but I have learned a great tip about matching eyes and lips as far as color goes   If you are wearing warm tones on your eyes (reds, browns, oranges) then use a cool toned lip (pinks, lilacs, etc).   If you are wearing cool tones on your eyes, then go with warm lips.    Take this as you will, I deviate from this sometimes, but when I get really confused with eye shadows I dont normally use, I follow these ""guidelines"""

RandomActsofMakeup,33ir1s,violetfirefly6,4,Thu Apr 23 03:08:09 2015 UTC,"Lips looks great, the cheeks, well instead of pink try salmon and less of it, you're using too much, and a bit upper (dont forget to smile while doing this), eyes, your brown looks great, but you can use gel liner (black), you have to practice it, try to wing it a bit, use also brown eyeshadow on the whole lid since you have asymmetric eyes, this will make this less noticeable. I have similar eyes to yours so this are my tips. Also try to recreate looks on the internet for hooded and asymmetric eyes."
RandomActsofMakeup,33ir1s,violetfirefly6,2,Thu Apr 23 02:25:16 2015 UTC,ahh okay.. I think I'm gonna play around with makeup quit a bit tomorrow...
RandomActsofMakeup,33ir1s,justfrank63,2,Thu Apr 23 03:12:40 2015 UTC,"Seconding the recommendation for less blush + pulling it back towards your temples.  My suggestions would be to soften the edges of the liner/shadow on your top lid and add a soft line of shadow on your lower lash line to balance the look and define your eyes more.  But above all I would recommend mascara, mascara, mascara (and curl your lashes too)! Eye makeup rarely ever looks complete without and it will really bring the whole look together.   Hopefully you don't mind, but I pulled your picture into photoshop to give you an idea/reference of what I've suggested. :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,33ir1s,sleeplessengineer,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:18:21 2015 UTC,"Okay, I see the blush and I just kind of played around with it after I read comments... Not sure if I'm applying it in the right area, but I'll post another CCW tomorrow and see what everyone says.  And I usually soften the edges of my eyeliner, but I still do it kind of thick because I have a hard time sharpening my pencils... But I think I might try out more liquid liner until I can get a well-functioning pencil sharpener.   Also the sad thing is, I was wearing mascara... But I'm gonna throw it out because it hasn't been applying very well... And I do have a new tube that applies okay-ish, but it's pretty messy because I think it might be over-filled.......  And I'll go look for an eyelash curler sometime this week:D"
RandomActsofMakeup,33ir1s,sleeplessengineer,3,Thu Apr 23 04:31:03 2015 UTC,"Curling my lashes changed my life. No lies. Hahaha :)   With blush, smile to bring out the apples of your cheeks, apply there and sweep it up towards your temples and blend well.  Have you tried using a dark shade of eyeshadow in place of liner? For my daily routine I usually use a dark brown shadow right along my lash line which I find gives a soft, natural look. It's also very forgiving since I'm usually doing my makeup in the car <_< (as the passenger of course!)   Good luck—I look forward to seeing your next post!"

RandomActsofMakeup,33ir1s,Secret_StoopKid,2,Thu Apr 23 05:21:11 2015 UTC,I just saw this last week and it's changed my relationship with mascara so I had to share! I followed her zig zag tip and I stop after one coat but it's still such a difference from the results I would get before. Honestly I used to hate mascara and I would skip that and curling eyelashes since my  eyelashes are straight and point down and practically refuse to curl but this method really helps and makes such a difference!

RandomActsofMakeup,33ir1s,-Glitterous-,2,Thu Apr 23 18:03:06 2015 UTC,"So take this with a grain of salt, I am still figuring things out for myself.  My advice would be to use less blush and place higher on the cheek and not quite so close to the nose. I also have a similar face shape and slight contouring on my cheeks makes my face look a little slimmer in the cheek area. There are plenty of tutorials on youtube.   For the eyes, I would say doing a winged liner would look awesome. But I loved winged liner and am slightly biased.   You have awesome brows though! :)"

RandomActsofMakeup,33gr54,ailurosly,3,Wed Apr 22 11:55:24 2015 UTC,"Oh golly, I thought there were only 3.  (My top tip though is that brushes can be used for SO many different things! Their uses can go as far as your imagination! The way I see these brushes could be vastly different than how someone else sees them!) But, alright, let's do this.   Dusting off any loose powder/mistakes from under your eyes.  Or a highlighter brush, buuuut: Highlighter brush.  Perfect for dusting the top of your cheekbones. A blush brush OR a contour brush.  It looks like a great little size, and I have a brush similar that I use for those 2 things (Primarily blush though) Contour or highlighter, since this one is smaller than no. 3.  You could also use it for undereye powder Yep, just a plain paddle foundation brush! I'm not sure how big this one is, but I'm thinking maybe a highlighter/contour or even an eyeshadow brush (Great for blending out edges)   7/8/9. All look like eyeshadow brushes to me! (Although, since 7. is so long, it looks more like a concealer brush, but I generally use them as eyeshadow brushes anyway)   Another plain eyeshadow brush These types of angled brushes are so good for winged liner because they're so teeny tiny, you get a great, precise line! I have no idea.  Looks like a flat eyeliner brush, but I can't really tell because of the angle. Eyeshadow.  Small brushes are always for eyeshadow in my eyes, haha   14/15. Again, I can't see these well because of the angle, but I'm just gonna say various eyeshadow.  16/17/18/19.  All eyeshadow brushes, just used for different things.  16 is good at packing on colour, and 18/19 are good for precise crease work or under bottom lash work.  20/21/22. All my favourite types of brushes, if they were fluffier, I love using them in the crease, but yours appear quite not-fluffy, so I'm not really sure.  You could maybe use them to put the shadow down, then use a fluffier brush to blend out with?  23/24.  More eyeshadow brushes.  Really, 70% of them just seem to be plain eyeshadow brushes?!?"

RandomActsofMakeup,33gr54,pokebecka,2,Wed Apr 22 12:23:42 2015 UTC,Great haul!!!!!! Looks like you have most of them figured out. I think the small ones could all be used for your brows or to highlight the inner corner of your eye. Some of the thicker but still small ones could be used for darkening your crease and putting another (usually darker) colour on the outer corner! You honestly can use brushes for whatever you want!

So, my SO being an IT guy, my parents always ask him to help them with their computer problems. He told me a month ago that he was going up to my parents' house to fix their computer, to which I replied, ""Cool! Haven't seen my dad, I'll go with you.""

I don't have a brand so far I'm particularly in love with, I don't feel I have enough experience to rate them against each other, I'm hapy with the longevity and what not of the ones I've tried, my only gripe is that some swatches on the sites look great but don't show up on me. However some indies are amazing in how ell they show up!  What colour are you interested in? Maybe that would be a good way to look for some.   I know Shiro sells their own brand as well as other indies so maybe an order from there will be good for you so you can try out different ones without adding on lots of postage.   Plum wine is the bestest!"
RandomActsofMakeup,33dbr4,betafrogg,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:08:31 2015 UTC,"I know next to nothing about makeup in general, so the next few weeks are going to be an education :)  I like purple.  I like blue.  I like deep, dark reds.  I like bruises.  I have no idea what I like on me, though -- the last time I wore makeup with any regularity, I was 15 and my best friend always did it for me :)  So I don't even know what looks good on me anymore!  I think I want to start out learning about foundation, and eyeliner.  I can commit to using eyeliner every morning, for practice.  And then move on from there I think...  I am checking out http://shirocosmetics.com/  :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,33dbr4,betafrogg,2,Tue Apr 21 21:41:41 2015 UTC,"An eyeliner game changer for me was getting an eyeliner brush like this one, it's quite thin and the elbow bend on it makes it easier to get to the lid, totally recommend it!  Practice will show, it took me a while but I can finally do both lids with the same thickness of line XD  Maybe just pick out a sample of each of the colours your interested in, and give them a try? It's your first foray in a while, so do some experimenting!  Foundation can be tricky, get matched at as many brands/ counter as you can and make sure you look at your face in natural daylight before you decide if you are going to buy.   You might want to look into eye primer, some people can get away without it for eyeliner and some can't. But it will defo be good for when you start to include eyeshadows- it will prevent creasing and make the shadow last longer."
RandomActsofMakeup,33dbr4,ploufffe,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:50:39 2015 UTC,"Wow, that brush is really interesting looking o.O  I will keep an eye out in the stores for one, and see how it goes.  And I'll add eye primer to my wish list.  Can you recommend a brand?  I worry about shaky hands and eventually just giving up because practice is hard.  But I'm gonna try :)  My wish list is sort of designed around the idea of 'play around, find out what colors work'.  So then I can figure out what I want to buy in more quantity, or better quality, or whatever.  Going up to a makeup counter and asking for help terrifies me!  I don't even know what to ask.  What should I say?  ""Hi, I know nothing about makeup, but I'm excited to be here""?  Heh.  I have a feeling I'm going to own way, way, WAY too many brushes by this time next year.  I really love brushes.  I own more shaving brushes than any one person needs, already."
RandomActsofMakeup,33dbr4,purpleandglitter,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:43:10 2015 UTC,"I've tried quite a few, and the two I really like so far (I feel like eye primer for my hooded, oily lids is my forever quest) are Etude House's Proof 10 which I got on eBay from a seller called Jolse, and Inglot's Eye Makeup Base. The Proof 10 i a bit easier to get hold of, and cheaper.    What causes your shaking? Have you tried supporting your hand with your other fingers resting on your face? I sometimes get pretty shakey and it's really annoying (esp at work!). If fine lines for eyeliner is proving too difficult because of shaking, you could try using a brush like this (2nd from the right) to 'press/ swipe' a dark brown or black on the part of your lid closest to the lashes, so not such a defined line but still quite an outlining to the eye.   You can say, I'm just getting into make up and I don't know much but  I wanted to try x type of thing do you have any samples? The worst they'll say is no, but they might be able to tril some on you.  o0 I own no shaving brushes, but all of the other ones! There are so many brushes out there, if you're  conigseaur then this might end up being a bit of a rabbit hole!"

RandomActsofMakeup,339v9q,jkalea,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:21:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but it seemed more appropriate than a PSA? In any case, there is an awesome (if somewhat roundabout and complex) way to save up to 50% at Sephora!   You need an American Express credit card (or even Serve card). If you don't have one, you can stop reading. You also have to be within driving distance of a Smart & Final store. Register your AMEX for the Smart & Final offer when you log into your Amex account, by either linking your Twitter account to your Amex account and tweeting ""#AmexSmartFinal"" or under ""Offers"" finding the Smart & Final deal and enrolling your card in the deal. Once registered with Amex (you will get a confirmation email from American Express), go to Smart & Final. Buy a $50 Sephora gift card, pay with your registered Amex. Repeat up to 3 times (separate transactions, but they can all be on the same day/right after one another). Amex will credit your account with $25 for each $50 transaction at Smart & Final, up to 3 times per registered card. So essentially, you will only have to pay off $75 of the $150 -- Amex will credit back your account the other $75. You now have $50 (or up to $150) in Sephora gift cards to spend, for which you only pay half. (You could also buy Amazon gift cards or Nordstrom gift cards...or groceries at Smart & Final...whatever you want from Smart & Final.) How rad is that!?   Obviously you don't want to do this if you don't have the money to immediately pay off your credit card as soon as you get the statement (paying interest negates any saving benefits! only ever charge on a credit card the amount you can afford to pay off in the next month!).  This is all completely legal, and awesome, and limited...Amex can pull the offer at any time. But I myself took advantage of this amazing deal yesterday and managed to place my Sephora orders on the same day (so I also got that 15% off from Sephora and 8% back from Ebates...bargain city!!).  I realize this is very complicated to explain...but it's simple if you understand the Amex offers that they regularly give cardholders. But feel free to message me if you have any questions. Just trying to share the bargains & spread the makeup buying love! :)"

RandomActsofMakeup,3356v2,Mrs_C_W,2,Sun Apr 19 17:38:13 2015 UTC,"I would get a nice concealer brush for under the eye. Take your product and put a little on your hand, dab brush in it, and then ""tap"" and quickly ""dab"" the area under your eye with it, for build-able coverage. My MUA showed me this tip and it really helps me with coverage. I would also use a highlighting concealer and mix it with a higher-coverage concealer.  http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/145/23769/Products/Brushes/Eye/287-Duo-Fibre-Eye-Shadow-Brush/index.tmpl I know it says its for eye-shadow but this is what she has me use.

RandomActsofMakeup,333ljz,purpleandglitter,4,Sun Apr 19 04:55:10 2015 UTC,"Aaaaah. I am absolutely obsessed with purple lipsticks! Happy to see more and more people using them. I'm more into the deep and bolder colors, and I haven't personally tried most of these, but I'll recommend some I know off the top of my head for you!    My go-to affordable and price to performance purple lipstick is Nyx's Macaron Lippies in either ""Violet"" or ""Lavender"", depending on how bright you'd like to go. It applies wonderfully, and they're only $6 a piece! They also have a Wicked Lippies line that has a metallic-deep purple called ""Immortal"".  If you want to test the waters in purple but not ready to go full blown, Nyx also have a Butter Lipstick shade in ""Hunk"" that's kind of a balmy plum color. WnW have a few purpley shades that I like as well. ""Sugar Plum Fairy"" is a plume-wine color, similar to Nyx Hunk but applies way more opaque. There's also ""Ravin' Raisin"" which is a smoked..raisin color? $3-5 Revlon's Color Burst Matte Balm in ""Shameless"". It's also a deep purple/violet that has great color payoff and applies wonderfully, wit a significant matte finish, around $6-7. Colorpop also have an assortment of purple shades, and from light to dark they'd be: ""Brills"" (Lavender-ish), ""Grind"" (dupe for MAC's Heroin, mid toned purple), and ""Leather"" (dark, dark purple)! They come with matching lipliners and are $5 each. If you want to try lip paint, J.Cat Cosmetics have a few that I like: "" Ches Desire Cat"" (Lavender), and ""Always Late, Rabbit!"" which is light purple. They have a new Pout-O-Holic Lipstick line with a light purple shade called ""Love"" - $5 a piece. A bit more on the expensive side, you've got MAC's ""Heroine"", ""Pure Heroin"" which is a darker variation of the former, as well as ""Cyber"" for a dark almost smokey purple. $16 Kat Von D has two purple shades that I adore as well, but haven't tried myself. ""L.U.V"" - pinky medium toned violet, it comes in either stick or liquid, and ""Coven"" - a light Lavender. Around $16-20 I believe. LA Splash also have great liquid lipsticks, and I'd recommend ""Criminal"" (purple) and ""Phantom"" (bluish muted purple) - around $12 each. OCC lip tar has ""Hoochie"" (pinked toned purple) and ""Roller Girl"" (lavender) - $16 My absolute favorite in-your-face-i-can-view-this-from-a-satellite purple is by Pretty Zombie cosmetics, and it's a liquid lipstick shade called ""3 Witches"", significantly cool toned. $18   I don't know much about more subtle purples, but I hope this helps give you somewhat of an idea! Love to see what you decide to go with :)  P.S. - After writing this out on a whim, I realize I have a serious problem. I need purple lipstick rehab."

Products used:   Sleek Ultra Matte V2 Palette Wet N Wild Fergie's eyeshadow primer in ""For My Primas"" (labeled as WnW primer) Wet N Wild Fergie's shimmer eyeshadow primer in ""A Little Party"" (labeled as WnW Shimmer primer)   Extra info:  Bought this palette on Amazon for about $10. Overall, I'm pretty impressed with the quality considering the price. The shadows kicked up some powder when applying, but they are decently pigmented. Though the shimmer primer kind of defeats the purpose of a matte, it is neat to see how you can turn a matte shadow into a shimmery shadow, and it picks up the pigment wonderfully. Definitely recommend a primer with these. Although the regular primer didn't show up as well in the photos, it is very obvious in person that the shadow needs a primer to really ""pop""."

RandomActsofMakeup,331ut0,MissBazinga,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:07:59 2015 UTC,You look great!! My only CC would be that it looks like you've got some nice lashes - have you tried curling them a bit? That would really make them pop! Hope initiation goes well :) Which fraternity is it?
RandomActsofMakeup,331ut0,MissBazinga,2,Sat Apr 18 18:56:03 2015 UTC,Thanks :). I curled them a little bit but I should start heating up the curler before I use it. I did it once and my lashes looked amazing. And it's the Sigma Chi initiation. My boyfriend is a recent alumn and I'm last year's sweetheart :)

RandomActsofMakeup,331n5y,To_each_their_0wn,2,Sat Apr 18 23:24:47 2015 UTC,"Hey hey, thank you so much lovely! I play Arma 3, L4D2, War Thunder, Sims 4 here and there (downloaded ""legally"" for the sake of the character creator. :P) Pillars of Eternity, GTAV, occasionally I play hearthstone and I used to play WoW when I was younger/little which actually got me into PC gaming. :)    Story time:  My uncle's definition of babysitting me when I was really little was play WoW whilst I sat on his lap and watched him run around and do stuff. Eventually that expanded to me reaching over and pressing buttons for him when he tells me to do so, then slowly he actually allowed me to play on his account then after that he let me take control (me sitting on his lap and him occasionally reaching over/past me and pressing buttons before I stuff up in game). Once he thought I was good enough he updated/upgraded my now very old PC and got me a subscription to WoW. He knew my family situation wasn't the best so whenever I was down or just in general he'd tell me to hop online to hang out and play with him in game. He even let me play with his guild and told them to be nice to me and to not be arses (but then again majority of them where older and married). I lost the account details and he stopped paying the subscription but hey, WoW was a huge help and got me really close to my awesome uncle and got me into PC."

I spent a bit of time in bed as I was exhausted but then my husband convinced me to go out for dinner and get dressed up, I said no at first and begged for pizza in bed lol but he convinced me and when we got there it was a surprise party!

Definitely better than Hard Candy Glamoflauge.  Beauty Blender Solid Cleanser: Holy cleansing batman, my brushes are softer and my blender is cleaner than it's ever been.  Don't skimp, use this. Sephora Pro Collection Angled Blush Brush #49: Excellent for contouring.  I had been using the $1 ELF brush before this and the new brush is a million times better at placement of pigment. Sephora Pro Collection Smoky Shadow Brush #30: I had a cheap-o white brush that I had been using to pat my shadow on, but this one does a much better job.   I'm a true believer now in having good brushes and cleansers :)"

Since the brushes shouldn't have a lot of polish/be a little dry it comes out streaky."

I think there's a good likelihood that I'll end up ordering more products from them in the future, and especially at their price point ($5 for each eyeshadow and lippie stick), I'd be confident recommending them to anyone looking to try new brands, products, or colors!"

RandomActsofMakeup,32hrb9,yrcutebabe,5,Tue Apr 14 02:18:34 2015 UTC,Yay! /u/jkalea is really the colourpop gifting queen!
RandomActsofMakeup,32hrb9,justxcookies,3,Tue Apr 14 15:54:57 2015 UTC,Okay this is important :how did you blend those shadows so well? I've tried to bad to make them work but I can never get a good blend on them :(
RandomActsofMakeup,32hrb9,jkalea,5,Tue Apr 14 02:55:49 2015 UTC,"I find you have to blend ColourPop shadows as soon as you apply them. The longer you wait the more the cream settles in and won't budge. Blend immediately after application, for each shade."
RandomActsofMakeup,32hrb9,jkalea,3,Tue Apr 14 07:21:12 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what /u/jkalea said! However, the Pixie Epoxy (sticky base) makes it very difficult to blend so I set down the base color first and carefully add the crease color. If it looks messy, I pat on more of the base color where it looks like I screwed up, and If I overblend and the color gets dull, I pat some more on for vibrancy."
RandomActsofMakeup,32hrb9,anotherdamnwriter,2,Tue Apr 14 14:52:56 2015 UTC,"Ooooo yes, overblending and downblending with a transition shade (I adore Truth for a transition shade) both very helpful!!"

You have to layer it a lot because it is a little transparent, but after you apply a lot it's really even and not patchy. It's also very smooth, almost oily, so totally not drying or anything.

I think I would start with a pale and dewy face for a canvas, use a shimmering white on the inner third, a pastel pink shimmer in the middle, and a darker reddish/pink in the outer corner. Brown eyeshadow under the waterline with the shimmering pastel pink in the water line.  A vibrant reddish pink lipstick, a pastel blush, and luminous highlights with an almond blossom and feather fascinator would complete the look.

For a Hibiscus-inspired look, I'd create something similar to this using my new Electric Palette. I'd start with UD's primer potion, then sweep the shade Free Spirit from the Tartelette palette all over my lids. I'd also add Force of Nature from Tartelette to my crease to act as a transition shade. Then I would pack Savage from the Electric palette onto my lid, then sweep Slowburn into my crease, focusing on the outer corner to create some depth. I'd use Thrash above my crease, but leave some space between Thrash and my brow. Then I would use a stiff angled brush to sweep Jilted under my lower lashline. Finally, I would tightline my upper and lower lashes using Urban Decay's 24/7 eyeliner in the color LSD.  To balance out the drama of the eyes, I would give my cheeks a slight glow with some cheek stain and go with a soft pink lipgloss.  Great contest!

I adore those KVD colors as I'm a huge purple fan, and I absolutely LOVE Disney. I'm super excited about entering this one!  Disney movies are something I love watching, so it's hard to pick just one, but I have to say that one movie I enjoy rewatching over and over is Mulan. I have a deep set fascination with ancient China, and Mulan has always been a different breed of princess in my opinion. She chooses her own path and persists with it, regardless of the opinion and tradition surrounding her. This resonates with me as I feel it's what I do with my own life as well. She's tough, smart and elegant, and I think that's a great role model to look up to.

He got very upset the fist time we read it and cried for days. We read it a few more ties but  he has since forgotten about it. It was on TV the other day so he started to watch it but just kept remembering how upset he was about the book!! He cant really grasp the idea of him turning into a bear i think.

I've seen a Disney movie that I didn't like a little bit. That being said the Disney movie that's had the biggest impact on me is Beauty and the Beast. I was a really bookish little girl with brown hair and for some reason me and the people in my town don't click... At all. Just like Belle comments have been made about me, whispers on the streets and in stores... ""Wow, that girl is so beautiful but so so weird..."" And for a while this completely tore me up inside... Like I literally couldn't handle all of that hateful glares I was getting, I just wanted to be anywhere but my stupid little town... That day I went home and watched Beauty and The Beast and something clicked... I'm Belle. I'm such a fragile and loving person yet I only see judgement from my peers... That also helped me realize that you can friends anywhere, be it books, ""monsters"", or common household items.    The Look: This look is still being created"""

It takes a lot of hard work and dedication to completely change your lifestyle so I wish you luck in that endeavor! :)  As for the makeup side of things, what's your current favorite product? What are some things you have been wanting to try makeup wise? :)"
RandomActsofMakeup,32cdk2,Friendly_freak,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:21:04 2015 UTC,"In the last week I've purged my closet and totally revamped how I store my clothes. It feels good even if it's just a small change.  Honestly that's part of the kicker. I've found myself lately going ""Ewww that doesn't look natural"" at even the most basic of eyeshadow looks I've tried (I've tended to neutrals for... forever) and then I just couldn't take it anymore. Why the heck am I so concerned about it looking ""natural""?? So I'm trying to revamp my relationship with makeup. I was honestly just thinking about trying to find ""baby's first eyeshadow look with color"" because I've stuck to just using brown/neutrals for a good 13 years almost. I don't even know where to begin anymore! lol  That said currently I'm in love with Nyx's butter glosses. I only own the one(Apple Strudel?), but I adore it and plan on picking up more in the future."

Rome wasn't build in one day. Most of us are still learning. But its so much fun to help others!! My most basic routine when I started was; Getting off all my make-up in the evening and put on moisturizer. In the morning; wash face again and use round cotton thingies to clean my face and moisturizer.   Make-up takes some time to learn. But it is so much fun when you get the hang of it!! Really!   Keep up the positive changes, and please be optimistic and keep trying!! :D"

Then one day I looked in the mirror and was like ""wtf is with under my eyes??? where did those lines come from????"" and then there was suddenly this knowledge that I'm getting older and with that comes changes and new things to worry about. Needless to say eye cream is going to be one of the big things I look into adding to my routine. XP  I've been using a cleanser before bed, but I fell out of the habit for the last week due to reasons. Looking to get back into the habit and add some more steps to it that address the things my skin needs to be healthier and happier.  My one fear is that since I suck at art I'm going to bomb make-up too. It's probably irrational, but what can you do?  So optimistic I'm here. :P See how that works?"

But I still manage it every single day! Almost 2 years strong. My face feels so dirty if I don't clean it before bed :(.   Noooo!!! I haven't even tried art. I don't suck at make-up. I'm mediocre at best, I should practice more. But its just how it makes you feel! You can accentuate that which you love about yourself. Wether it is your eyes, lips, lashes, cheekbones.

I walked my happy ass over there knowing I had to replace my Clarisonic brush head anyway so why not roam and play while I'm there? It was PACKED with tourists and the store was blasting loud-ass dance music. Like I get that nothing can be done about the tourists or the screaming kids but maybe playing something more ~chill wouldn't hurt, you know? It was super stressful but I tried to muscle through it since I work 50 hrs a week and rarely have time to browse. Also, it seemed like every tester I wanted to use was dried out or empty and it was really hard to find a BA that wasn't busy running around for their pushy-ass customers. I tried on some products that were whatever, lmk if you want reviews, and bought what I went there for: a replacement brush head for my Clarisonic, Elizabeth & James Nirvana White perfume oil, and a sheet mask and Bliss mini gift set for a homie.

All these things are what'll really make your facial features stand out more in a photograph, particularly flash photography."

I'm not in the states though, someone else would probably have more knowledge of your brands available than I would. If you can't get a hold of one, just layer the glamoflague you have and that should do the trick. I get so much hormonal redness around my nose, it can be such a pain to conceal!"

RandomActsofMakeup,321vs8,angelkely1213,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:29:07 2015 UTC,"I think they have a bigger selection, at least the one in my town does, prices are pretty much the same though. I do like Sephora's points plan where you can get a free gift with a certain number of points, I'm not entirely sure what the Ulta rewards plan does. Ulta also carries drugstore brands and NYX which I didn't see in Sephora and has more variety of the cheaper products. I think Sephora focuses mostly on high-end makeup from what I saw today."
RandomActsofMakeup,321vs8,LinzDarling,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:20:36 2015 UTC,"I have never been to a Sephora, as the closest one is an hour away, so I wouldn't be able to tell you. However, based on other people's reviews, generally Sephora employees are more pretentious than Ulta employees. Of course, this isn't always the case.  As far as prices go, they are the same, but Ulta, in my opinion, has way better sales than Sephora. Hope this helps!"

I also like the idea of challenges- stuff like ""this week you can only wear red lip products"" or ""use a product for something other than its intended purpose."" participation would be optional obviously. I just like the idea of having events we can participate in together without necessarily competing for a prize."
RandomActsofMakeup,320unn,shrmnmss,4,Thu Apr 9 19:52:56 2015 UTC,"Love the challenge idea that lasts for the week. Maybe begin on Monday, end on Saturday and post the album on Sunday? That would be fun!"
RandomActsofMakeup,320unn,CaptainCatbee,2,Thu Apr 9 22:03:10 2015 UTC,Yeah! Apparently we used to do something called Theme of the Week which might have been similar? But it was before my time so I don't really know the details.

RandomActsofMakeup,320unn,shrmnmss,6,Fri Apr 10 15:42:55 2015 UTC,"Hello, hello, my friends! Some ideas:   I would love to see brand discussions done on a weekly basis. There are so many different brands, I feel like the community wouldn't tire of them.  FOTD, weekly challenges: I think these are a good thing and will give members something to do outside contest challenges.  Non US members: I know it's been a topic off and on, trying to make sure everyone feels at home and included. I don't feel that anyone is purposely excluding anyone! Don't get me wrong! I do think the community would benefit if we made some posts that were geared towards other countries, such as brand discussions. Also, I would really appreciate a post about shipping internationally or using Amazon to purchase for non-US members. I think if we all had more info, it may open up people to hosting international contests.  We used to do the monthly(?) mod run gift card raffle and I'd love to see that return. It was a lot of fun and a great way to have a quickie contest.    Thank you for everything that y'all do! I hope everyone is doing well. Miss you!   PS. I still have my mod badge and flair. Now, I'm not complaining lol, but I don't want anyone upset that I have something I don't deserve."
RandomActsofMakeup,320unn,shrmnmss,6,Thu Apr 9 21:58:44 2015 UTC,"I think a post on how to gift to those outside the US via Amazon would be greatly beneficial because I have been here a while and tried to gift a few people with int'l Amazon wishlists and can't figure out how to/it won't let me, so I think that kind of info thread or something would be beneficial to the community :)   Also, you're not a mod anymore?

RandomActsofMakeup,3214pz,yrcutebabe,6,Thu Apr 9 19:07:53 2015 UTC,Small sections & lots of patience. Practice makes perfect. Also a fine tip eyeliner.
RandomActsofMakeup,3214pz,elsugh,5,Thu Apr 9 19:27:12 2015 UTC,Angled liner brush and gel eyeliner.   Push the brush gently to the base of your lashes. And wiggle it a little. Easy does it.
RandomActsofMakeup,3214pz,Friendly_freak,3,Thu Apr 9 19:50:55 2015 UTC,I use a small tip brush like this and black gel liner. I do it in small sections right in between my eyelashes =)
RandomActsofMakeup,3214pz,spartangrl0426,3,Thu Apr 9 21:26:37 2015 UTC,I like to use a thin felt tip liquid eyeliner.  Then I use the thinnest part of the tip and using very small movements press it into the line where your eyelashes come out of your skin.
RandomActsofMakeup,3214pz,hendricks1212,3,Thu Apr 9 23:00:34 2015 UTC,I use the Smudge Stick Eyeliner from Stila. I look the opposite direction and just swipe it on!

Indie brands, I like Geek Chic, though since they do loose powders, they get a little messy. Again, shaky hands. But, they stick to the top of the lid so I get the stuff off the lid and work with that."

But it's hard for me to find a heavy foundation that is light enough but has the right undertones. According to Sephora I'm neutral, but more of a cool neutral, but yet not pink.   What is your favorite foundation?"

I'm actually gonna go to Sephora before to get samples so I'll know if I want to buy the Algenist UV Defense Fluid SPF 50 and the new Cover FX Drops. No high SPF tinted moisturizers/BBs seem to agree with my skin so I'm gonna be a mad chemist and mix these babies...and mix my various foundations with the sunscreen and see what happens. Might pick up a sample of the Bite Agave Lip Mask as well.  I have to replace my Clinique Naturally Gentle eye makeup remover, so there's that. I also want to check out some glowy bronzers (wondering what the new Hourglass one is like, but it's $50 so idk).  how bout you?"

RandomActsofMakeup,31wd4y,vitrol,2,Wed Apr 8 19:01:15 2015 UTC,"Yea totally forgot about the Roller lash!! I got a sample so I don't need it just yet, but I LOVE it already. It creates and holds a curl which is awesome for when I don't have my eyelash curler on hand, or even if I do. The formula is very black, has a satin finish, and does not clump. The brush is the rubber type and is small enough to get every lash, including bottom lashes. Plus the packaging is adorable!"

It really brings out my blue eyes but doesn't clash against my pale skin (which I was afraid of when I first bought it).

RandomActsofMakeup,31u106,dumscivisti,3,Wed Apr 8 03:39:34 2015 UTC,"Okay, so! I think if you're going to get the most bang for your buck at Sephora, you're not going to want to buy foundations and the like because those are pricy. HOWEVER you get a free makeover with $50 in purchases so it's not a bad idea to make an appointment, go in, have them match you to a foundation and let them play with some products on you.  If you are looking to try foundation/concealer, I'd point you to Nyx (which is not sold at Sephora) as it's cheaper but still good quality.   You DEFINITELY need to be wearing moisturizer (and sunscreen) under your makeup. CeraVe and Cetaphil are popular options and you can get them at walgreen's or cvs (or similar drug store).  I think you might want to get a few fun items that you wouldn't get normally, and maybe some staples. Like good eyeshadow that has both fun and useable colors, and a colored liner and blush. That way, you get both fun and everyday looks out of it.  Value Sets might be your best bet. They include several items:   KVD True Romance Set checks off two of the items -- eyeshadow and colored liner. If you like the colors and think they'd suit you, KVD eyeshadow quality is amazing and I love her liners. Smashbox Try It Kit has primers for your face and eyes, eyeshadow and a mascara Tarte Showstopper Palette ticks the boxes for eyeshadow, bronzer/highlight and blush. You'd have about $10 left over for some fun eyeliners from sephora's brand. Tarte Poppy Plush palette has eyes and cheeks! Sephora's Brand is very good and this palette has baked eyeshadows and blush!   Eyeshadows:    This Sephora Set has a mix of neutrals and colors and is only $20 on sale! You could turn those shadows into colored eyeliner easily, either by just lining your eye using the angled brush it comes with, or putting it over nyx milk, or using the elf stuff that lets you foil it. I forget what it's called!   If not, I recommend something like this palette. It's not too expensive but likely better quality than what you have now. Choose colors that suit you! Neutrals are great if you'll wear them.  These are on sale if you like any of those colors. UD Naked Basics is popular, though probably not a great value considering the above.   Eyeliner:   Again, Sephora has great, cheap, fun colored eyeliners. their pencil liners I would compare to UD's and they have loads of colors. Stila is also popular. But, to be honest, if you are just playing around with colors, I think it makes more sense to use eyeshadow as an eyeliner so you don't end up hating them.  If you want ""idiot proof"" I would get the e.l.f. cream liner for like $3 along with an angled brush (also $3 from them) and practice your wings like that. It's cheap and I still use that to do my wings when I'm in a rush!   Blush/Contour:   So Sephora makes these blush/highlighter/bronzer trios that might be up your alley. They are a bit pricey, but they tick off 3 items on your list. I love the Josie Marak cheek gelees and the travel size are only $10. They are great for summer. You can use eyeshadow as a highlight. I use some of the sparkly white shades when I don't want to bring a bunch of different products. If it's safe for your eyes, it's safe for your face (NOTE: The reverse is not always true, eyes and lips have different issues than face makeup so don't go like putting blush on your eyes or lips or eyeshadow on your lips unless it's specifically mentioned that it's safe)   If I was you, this is what I would buy based on what I found here:   The Tarte Palette  - $$38 Sephora Pencil Liner in a color of your choice. $10    OR:   Sephora Colorful Palette $19 Sephora Baked Highlight/Blush/Bronzer $21  Sephora Pencil Liner in a color of your choice. $10"
RandomActsofMakeup,31u106,vitrol,2,Wed Apr 8 21:36:16 2015 UTC,"I recommend doing the foundation match IQ. Its free and you go in and ask for it. Its a machine and they take 3 closet up pictures of your skin. A picture of one on your forehead, cheek, and chin. The machine then pulls up ever foundation in the store that is your perfect match. You can filter your matches by what of coverage you want and if you have dry or oily skin.   I did this last week and honestly my makeup has never looked better. I think I matched my makeup pretty well before but my new color is dead on. Even in natural light. Totally worth it. Of my matches I picked the sephora collection liquid foundation and its just freaking amazing"
RandomActsofMakeup,31u106,LinzDarling,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:55:47 2015 UTC,I did that a while ago but they were all around 40$ /: I'm not sure if I'd be down with that because that's not really something I can afford to keep buying... Is there a noticeable difference in quality? Or is it just how close of a match it is?
RandomActsofMakeup,31u106,LinzDarling,2,Wed Apr 8 04:01:22 2015 UTC,My sephora collection match was $22. I have another sephora collection foundation that I picked out before the new technology and it lasted me 2 years because you don't need a lot. I think its a very large noticeable difference than when I would use drug store brands and Ive never had a color that matched me so well.
RandomActsofMakeup,31u106,Zannahquinn,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:29:21 2015 UTC,I will definitely have to check out that sephora collection
RandomActsofMakeup,31u106,Molllydollly,2,Wed Apr 8 04:59:39 2015 UTC,I would suggest trying the Sephora Collection products! They're generally affordable :)
RandomActsofMakeup,31u106,deltacharlie82,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:09:14 2015 UTC,OK I'll check them out ! Thanks :)
RandomActsofMakeup,31u106,Molllydollly,2,Wed Apr 8 04:13:35 2015 UTC,"Aw. If you only have cheap eyeshadows, I'd say splurge on a good palette that you'll get a lot of use out of! Maybe one of the naked palettes. They're nice cuz they have enough shades, and colors that actually go together well, that you can make a complete look without using any other shadows than what's in the palette. :) if you're very fair, maybe naked 3? My favorites number 2, depending on your coloring you could go with any of them."
RandomActsofMakeup,31u106,mayaleeb3,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:36:52 2015 UTC,I second this - better quality eye shadow really improves your overall look IMO. A pallet is a great way to get a variety of colors.
RandomActsofMakeup,31u106,hothotvolcano,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:50:15 2015 UTC,And they're more fun to use! If you get a new primer it's kinda boring because you can only do one thing with it. Eye shadows have so many more possibilities!
RandomActsofMakeup,31u106,hothotvolcano,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:15:27 2015 UTC,I recently got Naked 1 & 2 after having only used drug store products for years and I LOVE having them. They definitely make a difference. Personally I like Naked 2 more than Naked 1!
RandomActsofMakeup,31u106,Mrs_C_W,2,Wed Apr 8 15:27:15 2015 UTC,"I would suggest: Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector in Pearl or Moonstone.  I LOVE this product, it comes in a range of colors and I've seen a small set floating around with deluxe samples of more than 1 shade.  A little of this goes a very long way.  It's my favorite highlight product.  Benefit Gimme Brow...If you haven't started delving into the world of eyebrows, Gimme Brow is awesome and ""newbie proof""...it does not have the learning curve of pomades/gels/pencils that are easy to over-do and get discouraged...but it does fill out the natural shape and makes a huge difference.  here lateley I've been ignoring the rest of my face and just doing my brows if I'm just running around town.  It's $24 for a tiny tube, but I think it's super worth it.  Sephora brand has a lot of great items, look at palettes and brush sets if you're looking for value.  Just go in and look around!  See if they have any clearance going on.  I got a 6 piece OCC lip/eye pencil set for under $20. (the pencils are usually $16 each)  And I got a ""Best of Sephora"" 9 piece full size set that used to be $50 for $11 that way.  There usually isn't a huge, obvious clearance section in Sephora, but they do exist.  The grab-and-go section near the register has small versions of popular large products, you can always pick up several of them to try out and see if you like anything.  Like another user suggested, TooFaced does have very nice palettes for a good price, and a nice palette is going to go a long way."
RandomActsofMakeup,31u106,Mrs_C_W,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:38:56 2015 UTC,How light is the skin perfector?  I'm not sure I'm ready to do brows yet - I never went crazy with tweezing way back when and rocked the cave man brows up until about a month ago so I still have a fair bit to play with and shape :)  Clearances are my best friend. Hopefully they have some good ones on!  Thank you!!!

Some of them separate more easily that others and you have to shake and smoosh (technical term) them in the tube to remix them.  One of the ones I got online I never could get to work right so I returned it and eventually made it to a store this month to replace it.  I have found that with the lip tars I have to use the primer by OCC and I have to use a clear lip liner (I like the ELF lip lock) to keep them from feathering.  I have somewhat mature skin so feathering happens more than when I was younger.  Also they only take a super thin layer which I found frustrating at first to get used to doing.  Man the first time I used Black Dhalia I slathered it on, thick glossy and glorious.  Until is feathered and I looked like Courtney Love on a bad day.  It transferred onto everything so badly that my children said I had a lip disease.  I am better at using them now and they work fine but sometimes I feel like they aren't worth the effort so I only buy them if I need a specific crazy color."

It's one of those colors that's there but sometimes a bit under appreciated. For example, it's everywhere in nature, but people often look at the beautiful spring green leaves rather than the sturdy brown trunk and branches that have held up throughout the seasons. Brown can also bring people together, like the wooden dinner table, or give you that little boost of energy, like in soda."
