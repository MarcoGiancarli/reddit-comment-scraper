Okay, well, of the group of people with me in such a situation, if any of them are my friends, they know I'm exactly the sort of person who can get them through this situation.  To be quite honest though, the fewer people willing to listen to me and follow my lead, the safer I'm going to be.  First things first: Arms and armor.  The single most infuriating thing for me about slasher films is that so few people ever adequately arm themselves.  He's got a knife?  Then the order of the day is spears.  Spears are almost always my go-to weapon in this kind of situation because they're incredibly easy to improvise(a camp will have brooms and mops and kitchen knives to sharpen them with), they've got reach on them(much better than a knife's) and you can improvise pretty solid armor vs a one handed stab/slash over your torso and forearms with magazines or phonebooks and duct tape.    If there are 3 or more of us, we stay as a solid group, we grab a few bottles of water or juice, a box of snacks, a hurricane lamp and fuel or flashlights and batteries, and a bucket, and we hole up in a supply closet.  If somebody has to go, they go in the bucket.  Nobody leaves.  If the killer wants to get us he's going to have to come in through that one door and get a face full of sharpened wood.  If 2 or less people(or even better, none at all) we leave.  Tracking people is harder than most people realize.  Especially at night.  We follow Sirius and we walk at a brisk pace, and I teach them how to walk silently through the woods, a skill I learned through years of hunting.  Either the killer is going to have to try to track us, which will be exceedingly difficult to do at a speed where he can overtake us, or he's going to have to follow us closely enough that it will be very difficult not to be noticed with me rear-guarding."

But the global economy goes to shit as products are left on the portside, in the middle of highways, the stock exchanges are now unmanned and can't be upkept, and all import and export grinds to a halt.   We might have got it back on track by 2050, by which point Canda own the top few states, Mexico gets some of the lower ones, but gets pushed back from taking what they want due to their small military, and because no one wants to have a larger border with them (sounds horrible, I know, but let's be honest here).

hypotheticalsituation,3djshv,Tapochka,3,Fri Jul 17 03:18:52 2015 UTC,So you think America is the sole prevention of World War 3?
hypotheticalsituation,3djshv,Bobatrawn,2,Fri Jul 17 17:57:13 2015 UTC,"For now. No individual nation can take us. Assuming a traditional army against army war rather than the finding the enemy hiding among civilians warfare that we have had to fight over the last decade or so and assuming no nukes it would take a coalition of China, Russia and most of the rest of the world to win a fight against us. If you look at China flexing its might against its neighbors and Russia making moves in Eastern Europe as well as the many conflicts in Africa, it seems obvious that peace is not the natural state of nations and short of a dominant world power (like the US) or group of powers (like the balance of power between the Soviet Union and the US) or some other power to force peace on the not naturally peaceful, war is inevitable."
hypotheticalsituation,3djshv,Tapochka,2,Sat Jul 18 00:51:56 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that the US military strength cannot be beaten. However, I don't think its as simple as that (Edit: the idea that they're the only thing preventing world war 3). For instance, the development of nukes began with the US and USSR in the cold war. America has also played a big role in fueling foreign conflicts, both during and since the cold war."
hypotheticalsituation,3djshv,Bobatrawn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:44:17 2015 UTC,"We have played a roll in fueling conflict but there are other forces at work as well. Our presence is the only thing keeping the other forces in check. Russia wants to be a world power and extend its dominance. It would have this desire regardless of if America existed. We know this because it had this desire during the time of the Czars before America was a power. How do you think Russia got so big? It was only the existence of other nations that kept them in check that stopped their advance. Africa has been at war with itself for thousands of years. The power and influence of America is the primary cause of Japan no longer having dreams of conquest. How long will that last without America there to enforce their lack of military with a hungry China roaming the seas? The only thing stopping the war between China and Taiwan is the US. That will be the first one to erupt if the US disappeared. It would be followed closely by North Korea invading South Korea. Each of these things would trigger reactions from surrounding nations that would likely escalate things into, at best, a regional war. The largest counter to China would be a Japan, South Korea alliance. Japan is currently pasifist per their constitution. That would not last an hour if the US was gone. South Korea is prepared for war but actually desires peace. But they are not fools. With the US gone they know the North is coming for them. Despite their long history of animosity against Japan, they know their only chance at survival as an independent nation is an alliance with a military enhanced Japan. Between the two of them, they stand a chance as long as Russia is being aggressive to China's north and thereby diverting a large portion of China's military might to keep Russia in check, keeping an eye on India to make sure they do not attempt to ""free"" Tibet, and making a play for the US mainland.   Russia, meanwhile, will be making a play for the Stans south of them in order to bring them back into the fold. They will also be watching for aggression from China who is a historic rival for vast swaths of Siberia, as well as reclaiming Alaska and whatever portions of the mainland US they think they might get away with. Most of their attention will be paid to Eastern Europe however. They have long wanted Poland and the rest of the former Soviet Bloc. This will be the trigger for a re-militarized Germany which will trigger the re-militarization of the rest of Europe.   In the Middle East, chaos reigns. The current map of countries is artificial. A hundred years ago, there was just one country. The Byzantine Empire lost in World War I and as a result was carved into, more or less, the modern map of the Middle East. Each of the governments in the Middle East, with the exception of Israel, see themselves as the logical successor to the Byzantine Empire. Any who might be willing to forgo that position are unable to embrace the illusion that they will last long after the true successor to the Byzantine Empire gets worked out in the course of the regional war that breaks out. As a result, there will be no bystanders.   This is only the tip of the iceberg. Arguably the most violent conflicts will take place in the USA. We are the bread basket of the world. It would stun most people to know how much of our food is exported. That is food that will not be exported simply because there will be nobody to export it. Nobody to harvest it. Nobody to plant it. Nobody to provide the fuel for tractors. Nobody to process the chickens and pigs who are starving to death in barns because there is nobody to drive fuel-less trucks from empty animal food processors to unmanned farms. And even if all of this was somehow fully staffed, it would do no good because all of it requires power which itself is unstaffed. Besides, staffing food processing is difficult with bullets flying all over the place.   Mexico will invade from the South. Russia will take Alaska and invade from the North West. China will invade from all coastal regions and Cuba will make a play for Southern Florida. Japan will take Hawaii and engage in conflict with Russia over the Elution islands. later in the game, Canada and Europe will start making a play for the food producing heartland. The primary opponents of each of these will be groups from around the world who see this as a prime chance at staking out a claim to some prime real estate resulting in massive immigration from a hundred countries. Each of these groups will assume that if they put up enough of a fight, the prime combatants will move on to easier pickings.   If you are wondering why all this conflict rather than a worldwide sigh of relief at the loss of the US, the answer is food and oil. Everybody needs it and nobody feels they have enough. All the locations that are at play from the Stans to Eastern Europe to the islands of the pacific to Alaska to the US have either farmland or oil fields. There is also the matter of ""traditional territory"" but I guarantee you that Mexico will fight much harder for the territory above the oil fields and farmland of Texas then they will for the deserts of Arizona."

Ecology devastation would be inevitable.    We'd have to start looking at long term solutions to replenish carbon in the atmosphere.  Even that program was perfect and we kept earth habitable for as long as possible eventually the earth would run out of carbon completely.  Our only option would be to bring carbon in from off world, or start colonizing other worlds.  Now the good news...   Nope, no force on earth can disturb the state they are in.   With some careful planning people be killed in specific positions could be used as indestructible building materials.   We'd finally have materials durable enough to build a space elevator too.  There would be a huge industry in getting people to die with clasped hands and other interlocking positions.  For the terminally ill they have the opportunity to sell their last moments before becoming integral parts of some of mankind's most valuable constructions."
hypotheticalsituation,3d8yml,Pendaelose,3,Tue Jul 14 20:57:59 2015 UTC,"Best answer here! However I think the carbon hypothesis is a bit exaggerated. We are a small fraction of all the carbon on earth. We burn plenty via fossil fuels and wood. If anything, it probably just does enough to balance out the scales, only really becoming a problem hundreds of years down the line.   Totally can see corpse construction industries, however I think they would prefer us cut up into little bits first. It would be almost impossible to make a truly impenetrable layer as human bodies don't line up well and are so diverse in shape and size as to be useful for mass construction.   So you go into a body cutter before you die, lop off the arms and legs, and that's the last thing you see before you go."
hypotheticalsituation,3d8yml,steelerfaninperu,3,Wed Jul 15 15:43:37 2015 UTC,"So you go into a body cutter before you die,   An interesting angle.  I think OP did say that if the person has severed limbs the limbs become indestructible/unchangeable once the person dies.   If you work quickly you could definitely amputate the legs and arms and run them through an ultra thin meat slicer, making several hundred square feet of building material from each person..  Just make sure to add some standardized holes for mounting the plates together, because once the person finishes dying there will be no way to drill into the slices.   only really becoming a problem hundreds of years down the line.    Absolutely agreed, but I was thinking down the long run.  Over the span of many hundreds of years it would add up in a big way.  However, even if it takes a thousand years to become a problem the first structure built from indestructible corpse slices will still be standing as solid as it was the day it was built."
hypotheticalsituation,3d8yml,Pendaelose,2,Wed Jul 15 18:39:33 2015 UTC,"Better yet just grind the meat up! Instead of putting holes in, just make a mold like Legos and they'll snap together!  I'm still questioning the carbon problem. I mean we all live in wooden houses that must contain lots more carbon than we do in our bodies. It would definitely take millenia to become an issue IMO."
hypotheticalsituation,3d8yml,steelerfaninperu,2,Wed Jul 15 18:52:18 2015 UTC,"People underestimate the mass of dead bodies.  They add up much faster than you would expect.   Normally all those corpses get decomposed and the carbon is returned to the environment.  If that halts it's going to be an issue.  Not an issue right away, but it will be an unavoidable problem no matter how long it takes to be noticed.  I worry that grinding it up would actually turn it into thousands of indestructible fibers, rather than an indestructible block.  Once the fibers cannot be modified in any way there's a risk that they will simply fall apart from each other.  Another concern with a Lego-like structure is that legos are held together by the stretching force of the plastic in the block on top.   Since these blocks are potentially 100% impervious there would be no way for them to stretch around the pegs of the block below.  If the paste remains immutable after molding there are some building block options that still have potential, but it will be a little more intricate than legos.  On the other hand, Ultra thin (sub-millimeter) slices would be ideal because they are still intact pieces of the original, so we know from the prompt they will definitely work."

The government does keep track of how much money they have ""in the bank"" and how much they're spending on a month-to-month basis, and when there isn't enough to cover the month's outlay, congress does have to authorize the spending, even if the spending is covered by the budget. If a lot of businesses didn't send in their taxes on-time, congress would probably have to pass a ""business as usual"" law until it was all sorted out.  Assuming the businesses did start paying again fairly quickly (and paid their back taxes), they'd probably only face some fines, or maybe a stern talking to, depending on what SuperPACs they're friendly with.  If the businesses didn't start paying back taxes, the government would come down hard. I'd expect armed raids of corporate offices and per-walks for the CEOs and Boards of Directors, followed by some pretty lengthy prison sentences.

hypotheticalsituation,3cjpik,an_empty_voice,9,Thu Jul 9 13:36:10 2015 UTC,"Based on the picture in this article that shows him standing next to Tim Roth, who is 5'7"", I would estimate the height of the Hulk to be around 10 feet tall.   Robert Wadlow, was recorded to be the world's tallest man at 8'11"" and depending on which article you read, he is said to weigh anywhere from 439 - 490 lbs. Robert is considerably skinnier than the Hulk. Taking an estimate that the Hulk is about 3 to 4 times the mass of Robert that would put the Hulk to be in the range of 1317 -  1960 pounds. So /u/TristanTheViking's estimate of about a ton is also feasible.  This article states that Robert had a caloric intake of about 8000 a day. Michael Phelps, who is 6'4"", has a 12000/day caloric intake. Assuming the Hulk is about as active as Phelps, I'll apply the same ratio of 3 to 4 times against the highest intake so that puts him at a range of 36000 - 48000 calories needed a day.  Currently the world's most power hand gun is the Smith and Wesson 500 Magnum. Based on this video you can see how much damage is done to the clear ballistic gel as the bullet enters it. Also some of the damage they show shooting at other stuff, I would say yes, you can kill him with a S&W 500 Magnum.   This video shows a man breaking out of a pair of handcuffs. Although he doesn't break the chain he does manage to twist the cuff and get out of them. So in answer to your question 4, I would also say yes.  A polar bear can range between 8 - 10 feet standing on its hind leg and can weigh 750 - 1200 lbs. It also has natural claws and teeth while your Hulk's advantage might be that he slightly outweighs the bear. Hard to say who might win in unarmed combat, but I'll give the advantage to the Hulk.  I am now losing interest in doing any more research on this topic. So cheers!"

hypotheticalsituation,3cbful,TristanTheViking,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:24:37 2015 UTC,"The people it would affect would not be those who affect the world too significantly. Some guy lopping heads off of prisoners in some abandoned factory isn't too great an influence on the world as a whole.  The selection process would also be difficult. Some people are obviously guilty of war crimes, but where exactly is the line? If a soldier shoots an innocent bystander by accident, are they counted? If you think that is too obvious, than how about militants inflicting collateral damage? If a drone pilot blows up a terrorist hotspot filled with horrible people but some civilians are caught up in it, are they responsible in your scenario? What about the persons who ordered the assault?  Depending on where you draw the line (or how hazy you make it) we could see anywhere from just a few thousand footsoldiers being affected to hundreds of thousands of intermediaries and pencil-pushers being affected as well.  In the latter scenario you'll obviously see more of a change given the greater number of people and the fact that higher ranking and more influential officials would be involved.  Then there's the question of perspective. Is their experience a 1:1 video + neural reproduction in their brain where they're experiencing it but are aware of what is happening? Or is it more like they forget themselves and believe that what they're experiencing is reality?  This is important because a person may come out of it differently depending on the case. Someone who inflicts any severe level of torture or misery on another human is one who is typically lacking in empathy, or at least takes pleasure in harming other people. For them, living as someone else while still knowing who they are may not affect them as much. Sure they'll feel the pain and anguish they inflicted, but they may not consider the injustice of it. They may even harbor further resentment against their victims after the fact. Remember that these people aren't alien to pain. They understand that what they're doing is hurting people.  If the goal is to grant humility to the assailants, then you'd want to do the second scenario I described, where the person believes themselves to be the victim and for them to believe that they are in control (especially when the victim usually has no control).  Regardless I think the effect would be rather underwhelming. The people affected would probably either kill themselves from guilt or else suffer severe and debilitating mental issues that they would carry for the rest of their lives, however long or short. They'd probably be rendered useless for any job or activity requiring concentration or responsibility for anyone/anything even mildly important. Maybe a couple of dozen high profile people worldwide would be affected, removed, and replaced, but the vast majority would quietly die off without much outside communication.  As for how everyone else would react, I'd say nonplussed. Assuming we can get one of these now PTSD-riddled individuals to disclose what happened, it'd be written off in an episode of 60-minutes with the specifics being left to psychologists and whatever other scientific community gets involved. Depending on how many are observed to have this happen to them, there may not be any public reaction at all. 1 minute is a short time for something like this to happen. At least one half of the world will be asleep when it hits them, and the other half will either be alone or otherwise in a situation where no one will see them until after the fact.  So on a scale from ""Yesterday I ate a bagel"" to ""There's a meteor heading for Earth"" I'd say that this would rank pretty low on the public knowledge scale."

hypotheticalsituation,3bubja,Pisceswriter123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:17:32 2015 UTC,Not completely necessarily. Alaska and Hawaii are two isolated states in the union. If Hawaii seceded and became its own independent country any invasion by the US could cause some type of international incident. At least I would assume. Alaska on the other hand is vast and has plenty of untouched wilderness with its own oil reserves. The lower 48 I can see unsuccessful secessions because most of the military is right there. Any uprising could immedately be dealt with.

If even 0.000001% of its energy escaped, everyone for miles and miles would die very violently and very quickly. Possibly Earth's biosphere would be destroyed, I don't know exactly how much energy is involved.  Best case scenario that you're looking for, a tiny fraction of the energy is converted to kinetic energy, and the soccer ball shoots through the goal, the goalie who tries to block it, the stands behind the goal, the building behind the stands, and the atmosphere behind the buildings.

hypotheticalsituation,3bpvqi,Skorpii1,22,Wed Jul 1 04:50:42 2015 UTC,"Depends on how we figured that out. If we just happen to find them while the Martian Rovers are roaming around at the present, news media would be all over it.  People will probably dismiss it as a hoax at first, but as more government funding proceeds to NASA, the Mars manned missions might become closer to reality than we thought.  Now assuming the aliens also have similar technologies to us, we could then work on communication barriers. In the next 20 or so years post-contact, we'd probably be able to connect our technology together in ways that boost both.  There would be a significant increase in connectivity as well. If the aliens had internet, we'd start to make whole wireless networks that stretch from here to other planets, like Mars. We'd probably make the Moon some sort of outpost for something.  Extrapolating a bit more, but we'd begin to look towards Venus and Mercury probably, before we go anywhere near the asteroid fields. Culture assimilation would've been done by then and we'd have aliens mingling with humans much as we have different races mingling with each other already.  These are just the technological effects. Socially, everything could change.  Politically we'd have to set new standards on territories, not to mention we're probably infringing on some law they made by illegally trespassing on, say, Mars, with our rovers. (if these guys operate similar to Earth based politics).  What about socially too? Aliens would bring about a whole different level of change to the religious scene. If they have their own culture and myths, we'd be seeing another mingling that could spell trouble if the groups begin to disagree. Then again there would be religions that would probably mix if they had similarities too.  We'd also be getting some viruses and/or developments in medicine. Xenobiology could mean there are diseases mutated to the aliens that could kill a lot of us, but the opposite could happen. We could use something from the aliens to cure our major diseases if it's possible, maybe something from us can cure their diseases too.  Essentially summing this up: If everything turns out okay at the start and we don't go to open war, this could essentially be another New World era for both races, and imagine finding even more."

hypotheticalsituation,3bpvqi,Leard,7,Wed Jul 1 11:03:30 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest effect would be a speculation as to why we exist.   Think about it, life on every single planet in our solar system has managed to evolve to similar intelligence within the same time frame. it takes billions of years of evolution to reach the intelligence of humanity. the fact that similar organisms exist on every single planet leads to one logical conclusion: Life came to all of our planets at relatively the same time, and took a similar evolutionary path. Otherwise, all of the planets would be at radically points in the evolutionary timeline.  This highly indicates some kind of intellegent intervention. Be it god, and ancient race, or some kind of mass solar extinction event, something intervened to make life start at the same time. Does this mean we have some greater purpose, or some kind of cataclysm to prepare for? No one would know, but it would certainly make speculation run wild."

We'd send them something to let them communicate, and teach them technology. Or we'd decide to go Prime Directive and make them continue living without any technology. I'm really hoping for the first option. We'd probably send people to make contact, but it wouldn't actually be all that helpful.  After finding the Martians, space exploration would get a lot more funding. We'd probably check moons that might reasonably have life before the other planets, so that would slow us down a bit. We'd find others before long, and behave similarly. Although we're not going to send astronauts to Venus or any of the gas giants, for obvious reasons.

hypotheticalsituation,3bprze,PlatFleece,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:14:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's safe to assume that these aliens would not be concerned with destroying/inadvertently changing human cultures (like, what the Star Trek - Prime Directive is supposed to prohibit). Humans would interpret the contact positively, negatively or rationally. Religious people would embrace or reject the contacts, and I think that most people would not welcome them, but a few would embrace them.   A lot depends on the nature and intentions of the contact. We've established that a sufficiently advanced species would understand that by contacting us, it could cause us great harm. So they'd need a good reason for contacting us, or they might have negative intentions. Rationally speaking, I like to think that if the aliens have achieved a level of technology capable of species-wide self destruction (nukes, etc) AND SURVIVED this period, they would not be hostile under normal circumstances.  If they're in trouble, then their intentions are likely majority selfish anyhow, so the consequences of contact regardless of the circumstances sounds bad.  There is a third option... that is if WE were in trouble and they were trying to help us. Having an additional friendly species existing at the same time as you can be quite useful, so they'd have a motivation for actually helping us, though I think humans would be very resistant to accepting help from an alien species."

It is subsistence agriculture that typically uses little technology. It is typically key in shifting cultivation agriculture, and in transhumance livestock herding.   Old terms for slash-and-burn in English include assarting, swidden, and fire-fallow cultivation. Today the term slash-and-burn is mainly associated with tropical rain forests. Slash-and-burn is used by between 200 and 500 million people worldwide.   In 2004 it was estimated that, in Brazil alone, 500,000 small farmers cleared an average of one hectare of forest per year each. [clarification needed] The technique is not sustainable in large populations, because without the trees, the soil quality becomes too poor to support crops. The farmers would have to move on to virgin forest and repeat the process. Methods such as Inga alley farming have been proposed as alternatives to this ecological destruction.   35% of the farming land in the Murray Darling Basin area was cleared using 'Slash and Burn.'

The advent of cellular technology, for example, led to a massive cultural shift that we're still working through. Pagers to the first mobiles to mass mobile, and now to mobile web and smartphones- the amount of information and personal accessibility has completely changed.

Is this part of a bill that also strips tax exemption from Protestant churches, and indeed all churches and other religious temples as well?   If so, the bill isn't going to be popular among religious moderates and the political party and the politicians who passed it are going to lose swing states with high religious populations like Iowa in elections. The Holy See will not be happy with the USA and protest the decision. However, I think that this decision will be reversed by politicians elected in 2016, because there's no way this bill's going to be popular.  If not, than despite the lower overall tax burden than above, it would be even worse. You would be re-igniting a long-dead* societal conflict between Catholics and Protestants. The Holy See would be furious at what could be perceived as targeted discrimination and refuse to pay the tax. The USA will lose political influence in Latin America. Whichever political party makes this decision will lose the Hispanic vote and will risk losing states like Ohio with Eastern European catholic minorities who still live in old factory towns. They'll lose the 2016 election handily.   *long dead as a major conflict. The Know-Nothing Party, with it's very descriptive name, is thankfully an historical footnote today.  Before the religious church-goers have an opportunity to vote out the politicians who passed this bill, there will be increased tax fraud and private churches popping up in various locations in the country. If the IRS starts prosecuting church(s) for not playing their taxes, lawyers will take the issue to the high courts in response to what they perceive as a violation of freedom of religion."

Establish a ""ministry of automation"" which hires computer scientists to automate government and industry. Also to monitor automation technology and deal with its impact on society. They also partner with businesses like grocery stores to help buy automated cashiers, under the condition that part of the wages saved goes directly to that community. Politicians that vote yes to send their citizens into war must go to the front lines themselves, or send a family member. Technological literacy is now a core subject in schools.

Semi-regularly test people with huge incomes from intellectual property.   Once I feel these systems are solidly in place, organize an election for my replacement using a modern electoral system.

So if you hurt someone by accident, and it is truly an accident (a light example: you open a door and you didn't know someone was on the other side and it knocks them down or injures them), would you then die for that?  On the flip side, if you are driving and two little boys run into the road, and you can't stop in time to avoid hitting one of them, would you die for hitting the one that ran in front of you (or not because it is an unavoidable accident)?  Or would you die if you intentionally swerved to miss him and hit the other one?  What if you swerved to miss the first boy because you didn't see the second boy until it was too late?  If someone walked out in front of a bus, and you tackled them out of the way, would you die because they scraped their knee?  If you caused or forced someone to harm you, would you die because in doing so you are harming them?  Would they still die?  If a fanatic is willing to die for their beliefs and is about to kill someone else, would you die if you harmed them while trying to stop them?  Or does the fact that you are doing it to save someone counteract the harm?  If you do something that might hurt someone, but probably won't, is that enough intent for you to die if it does?  For example, there is a very small chance when pitching in baseball that you might injure someone by accident.  If it happens, it wasn't intentional, but you knew it was a possibility that it might be a side effect.  Do you die?  Do you have to cause injury to die?  Or only pain?  If all you have to do is cause pain, what about people who suffer from fibromyalgia and suffer pain from even light touch.  Do they have to be treated like lepers and hidden away to protect the rest of us?  What about an orderly at a mental asylum.  If they have to restrain a violent patient to prevent them from hurting someone (and dying), could they die if they perform a joint lock incorrectly?  How can they learn how to do it correctly if they die the first time they do it wrong?  Do we have to just let people with mental illness that might make them violent roam free because we can't stop them without dying ourselves?  If they hurt someone but don't understand their actions, do they still die?  If not, how can anyone stop them?"
hypotheticalsituation,3a5vfv,Clsjajll,3,Wed Jun 17 23:53:23 2015 UTC,"Good questions. I removed a big problem by suggesting a link between intention and effect. Since the intent was ""intent to harm"", some philosophers do distinguish ""intent to harm"" from ""knowledge of future harm"". So it is possible to know that your actions will harm someone, but not intend to harm them. Accidental harm, harm that you cannot stop (running onto the road) and other examples would fall into that category. So would surgery, preventing patients from harming others, saving people from accidents and the like.  The other issue is that since successful harming of others is possible if you are fanatical, those who stop fanatics through any kind of harm must either intend to save others but not harm the person (as much as possible) OR be fanatics themselves.  The final issue that you brought up seems to be a real problem. It seems that perfection is required in order to survive. If it is easy for humans to kill others or to intend harm to others, then the majority of humanity will die. I think that this final issue is best illustrated by children. Many young children do not really understand that harming other people is (usually) wrong. They can understand that the other person was harmed and they certainly did intend to harm them. Therefore, most children die. (There are rare exceptions, but unless genetically or magically modified, this results in a massive die off.)"

Survive the ecological collapse afterward, lasting long enough for food you can eat to start growing again in sufficient amounts.   The first one is pretty easy. Anyone near the impact itself is screwed, but a sturdy low-flammability building or underground chamber will be sufficient most everywhere else. In large parts of the world it'll be no worse than having a nearby volcano erupt - uncomfortably hot and nasty air, a light rain of ash, and maybe an earth tremor. With this much forewarning and knowledge of the impact site pretty much everyone can get away from it and have a safe hidey-hole.  The second part is a lot harder, and is what's going to result in the most deaths. Well, it's a lot harder for most species that aren't humans. We're sort of embarassingly good at this part of the challenge. The challenge here is twofold:   Drastic short-term climate change leaves animals in situations they're ill-adapted to There's just not much food growing in the aftermath   Humans are well-adapted to every type of climate Earth can throw at us. We live comfortably everywhere from the high Arctic to the Sahara. We're not going to have trouble in the chilly darkness of an asteroid winter.  The food shortage is a problem. But humans are also pretty unique amongst animals in that we're able to store years worth of food. Decades worth, if we really wanted to. In the years leading up to this asteroid impact the canneries and bottlers of the world are going to be working full-tilt preserving food. Right before the asteroid hits pretty much every cow in the world is going to be turned into jerky - might as well, the cows will die anyway. That food will have to be rationed out for a year or two after the impact, and in all honesty I'm pretty sure there'll be millions or even billions dying from starvation and from fighting over it. But it's just not a species-level threat to us. I doubt there'll even be a discontinuity in our global culture (though it'll shake up our economy and national identities something fierce).  In the post-asteroid world there'll be a significant reduction in biodiversity, and some of the species we've relied on for food in the past might be extinct. But lots won't be extinct and we'll make do. Rebuilding will happen quickly, a generation or two and we'll be caught back up to where we were when we got hit.

You could detonate every nuclear weapon that every country has or can produce on it and it likely wouldn't help. This also assumes that we'd be able to focus this energy directly at the rock and not instead launch the probe away from it (or destroy the probe).  Consider as well that this thing would be 5 years away from us at whatever rate it's going. I'm sure there's a range of speeds it could be going depending on its trajectory, but it's likely that in order to reach it our mega-bomb would take at least 2 years to reach it, decelerate, land, and then detonate.

hypotheticalsituation,3a1w6t,4445414442454546,2,Tue Jun 16 21:04:40 2015 UTC,"I was assuming he meant 5500 as a diameter, which means it would be less than 2x the size of Mars.  That would give it a volume of 87113746290 km3, assuming liquid water rather than ice or gas(both of which would start happening pretty quickly in the void of space), thanks to the fact that water weighs exactly 1 ton per cubic meter, this gives us a mass of 87,113,746,290,000,000,000 tons, Mars weighs 707,520,000,000,000,000,000 tons or nearly 10x as much.  So it's larger than Mars, but less massive, and far less dense.  There's also the fact that water has a very low viscosity, and since OP said water, not ice, there would also be no crystalline structures.  Or, put another way, nothing is holding this giant sphere of water in its shape other than its own gravity.    This is the part I could be wrong about, but like I said, either this sphere of water is put in an orbit around the sun, in which case it has the sun and all the other planets dragging on it with (comparably) slight tidal forces, or it's put out there with no inertia at all and starts falling inward, with Jupiter and then the Earth also tugging at it.  In either case, it starts to move, and I don't think it has the required mass to keep itself in shape and, as soon as the mass of water starts separating it will have even less mass to keep it in shape and etc.  Water's just not terribly dense when compared to nickel or iron.  There are planets made out of less dense materials like Neptune and Uranus, but they're both an order of magnitude or more more massive than Earth, not less as is the case of our water planet.  Like I said, I could be wrong and that amount of water could be over the threshold required for a celestial body's own gravity to hold it together, but if it's not, which I don't think it is, it would rapidly break up into smaller and smaller pieces which would fall into an orbit around the sun.  We might(or might not) see a few shiny streaks in the night as the scattering water reflects sunlight but it would fall to zero visibility with the naked eye pretty quick."

hypotheticalsituation,3a1w6t,FaceDeer,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:42:01 2015 UTC,"I think your math went a bit off somewhere. For a radius of 2250 km I get a volume of 4.77*1010 cubic kilometers. A cubic kilometer of water has a mass of 1*1012 kg, so the planet's mass is 4.77*1022 kg.  By Newton's law of gravitation, its surface gravity would be G*m/r2. That works out to 0.63 m/s2 or about 0.06 Earth gravities. Pretty light, but enough that it's not going to boil away into space right away. Also, this calculation underestimates because the planet would be denser than ordinary water at Earth's surface - the high pressure in its core will make the water denser, and I expect much of it will be solid due to water's high-pressure phases of ice - see Phases of ice.  If we take the radius literally rather than as a diameter I get a mass of 6.97*1023 kg and a surface gravity of 1.54 m/s2.  Edit: All that calculating and I didn't realize that 5500/2 is not 2250. :) Recalculating, will have proper numbers in a moment...  Okay. For 2750 km radius the planet has a mass of 8.71*1021 kg and a surface gravity of 0.77 m/s2. So your math was right, my bad. Hope my surface gravity calculations were useful, at any rate. :)"

Basically the argument was that if Dr. Manhattan was behind the attacks people/2nd world would hate even more on America, rather than join forces with them. It would be the spark that lits WW3 and the end, not something that brings everyone together in some utopia.  The reason Dr. Manhattan is seen as such an American thing/weapon is, among other things, him winning the Vietnam War, a war that was very Capitalism vs. Communism, USA versus USSR. If he was on their side then, he must still be so, even if blasts New York and other Allied cities.  Or maybe he has gone rogue, he is still the Americans fault at best, they are to blame.

Furthermore, part of the genius(and also symbolic significance) of Ozymandias' alien-bomb is that it hits America. So even if there was still some kind of paranoia that Dr. Manlymcmanstick was still defending America, it would get cleared up pretty quick once Ozymandias' alien appeared.

The trick to winning a nuclear war would be getting the first strike quick enough to mitigate your opponent's second strike, either by reducing it to acceptable levels, or preventing them from launching entirely.  The classical example is a decapitating strike. You hit the leadership fast enough or stealthily (via a stealth bomber, or a suitcase nuke) that there isn't anyone left to authorize the launch, or you hit the launch sites quick enough that they can't launch their second strike. Both have been mostly mitigated by SSBMs, which are hard to detect and can independently fire missiles without the authorization of outside leadership, guaranteeing a crippling second strike. The former case has also been mitigated in some cases by a fail-deadly system where the missiles launch if an opposing launch is detected."

Are you saying the first planet is two light-seconds away from the sun, the second planet is four light-seconds away, etc.? If the second planet is twice as far as the first, it would get four times as much sunlight, so they can't easily both be habitable. If there were two planets that were about two light-seconds away, they'd be too close to each other and their orbits wouldn't be stable.  The moon is still very difficult to reach from the earth. We'd be more interested in settling it if it was habitable, but probably not by all that much. Early settlements, such as Europe settling the Americas, were done as an investment with the intention of getting the money back. It's unlikely that settling a body as far away as the moon would become profitable in the foreseeable future.  Once the planets are settled, intellectual property can be traded freely, but sending physical goods would be prohibitively expensive.  I'd imagine any colonies would eventually break away from the countries that founded them, so each country would be limited to its own planet. Wars between planets would be rare, since they'd be so expensive to fight and it would be difficult to get any benefit from it.  If spaceflight gets cheaper, it's possible it would eventually become more like how different continents are now.

hypotheticalsituation,38dylb,CrazyCalYa,6,Thu Jun 4 20:27:22 2015 UTC,"Aside from the acute problems (death and injury, shock and confusion), some areas would just be completely cut off from ground traffic—Manhattan comes to mind. But even elsewhere, as every river becomes a barrier to ground shipment, the economy is going to be in some serious trouble. For example, the Mississippi cuts the U.S. basically in half, and all of a sudden no trucks can get across it. I'm no economist, but I imagine that would be a big problem.  When the I-35W bridge collapsed in Minneapolis in 2007, a new bridge was planned and built as quickly as possible, but it still took an entire year before the new one opened, and that was with the resources of an entire state poured into a single bridge. It stands to reason that it would take some years before even just every major bridge was rebuilt. Although I have to imagine that temporary measures would be set up on some of the major routes. I don't know what form this would take. Could temporary bridges be built quickly to ease the strain until permanent replacements went up?  The more I think about this, the worse, I think it would be. We're talking about a huge worldwide disaster. Governments around the world are going to have to pour billions of dollars into this just to build the new bridges. To reference the I-35W bridge collapse again, the replacement bridge there cost $234 million—that's for one single bridge. And that's without considering the millions it cost to deal with emergency response and so forth. So I have to imagine it's going to cost trillions of dollars to fix all the broken infrastructure just in the U.S. alone; I don't even know how to begin to imagine what it would cost the economy in the mean time, or to account for this happening all over the world."

I do agree with DCarrier's proposal of saving eggs, I forgot that was a thing when I made this whole thing up.  As for Reality A's population predicament, I forgot to mention that after all current males disappear, any future babies (conceived through insemination post-male disappearance) can become males and therefore available as potential sperm donors.

Look up the history of the middle ages to basically after the age of exploration. The papacy (which at that time had more to do with what family had the most powerfull ties) had more power than kings and the kings of say france, england, spain, etc had to get the popes goes ahead to marry, divorce, make war, make peace. Most of the kingdoms were a theocracy with the pope on top and the king ruling the country by his grace. In fact that point is one of the things that led to the English breaking away form the English church to form their own church (their was a desire to break away years before Henry VII decided to get a divorce)  They basically used a few things to rule. First off by having the last say so on religious matters they could say what treaties could be formed due to marriages being accepted or not. They also used things like tithes and payments to get out of purgatory to keep the kingdoms under their thumbs.  One of the reasons the protestant reformation came about was because of the rampant money hungry corruption in the catholic church and the desire to have the separation of the church form the state functions. So because it has already happened i doubt it could again. Especially since we now have thanks to the reformation and things like the Bill of rights over two hundred years of rule under secular goverments."

If it's the second one, they're doomed. If it's the first one, they'd resort to diplomacy, and they might be successful. They could increase the administrative duties of the Holy See, use this to justify increasing the number of people there, and use this to create an excuse to ask for more land. They might be able to buy a larger piece of Rome from Italy.  Italy's GDP is about $2 trillion, and the Catholic church is believed to have an operating budget of around $170 billion per year, so if they're willing to pay, they could probably get a lot from Italy. Still, I don't think they could do much better than convincing Italy to move their capital and taking over Rome. Italy isn't going to sell Italy.  If they don't mind losing their existance as a contiguous country, they could try to establish a small presence in each nation. Since they no longer have a particular reason to buy cities of political and historical importance, it probably won't cost nearly as much.  If they actually want an entire country to themselves, it will get harder. One strategy would be to convert a dictator, and get them to donate their country to the church. This wouldn't be easy, but it would be doable. Unfortunately, it will also turn public opinion against them. They'll lose members, and with it tithing. Hopefully, they'll get a country rich enough to make up the difference.  Another thing they could try is operating in secret. They could topple governments and replace them with puppet governments. It's kind of hard to do something on this scale without being noticed though."

hypotheticalsituation,3855yt,Mutant_Llama1,5,Mon Jun 1 22:51:09 2015 UTC,"Power would consolidate into the hands of a few families very quickly.  Life terms means any socially driven change will take much, much longer to occur.  The whole power structure basically ensures that whatever ideology first gains control will hold it almost indefinitely.  Individual citizens have virtually no power, as they don't get to vote on their leadership.    The last part about assassinating the leader sounds like a huge headache, and I don't really see the value of it. Does the unwanted law revert when the leader is killed? If so, why bother letting the Leader enact it in the first place. If not, what was the point of killing the Leader? Either way, the next Leader still has to either agree with their predecessor or agree with the Advisors. This system is just too ripe for corruption.   With all that said, I'd like to recommend a book that uses a similar idea. Solar Lottery by Phillip K Dick. Here's an excerpt from the Wiki:    Solar Lottery takes place in a world dominated by logic and numbers. Loosely based on a numerical military strategy employed by U.S. and Soviet intelligence called minimax (part ofgame theory), the Quizmaster, head of world government, is chosen through a sophisticated, computerized lottery. This element of randomization in the society serves as a form of social control since nobody, in theory at least, has any more of an advantage over anybody else in becoming the next Quizmaster.  Society is further entertained by a televised selection process in which an assassin is also allegedly chosen at random. By countering and putting down these threats to his life (using telepathic bodyguards as defense), the leader gains the respect of the people. If he loses his life a new Quizmaster, as well as another assassin, are again randomly selected. Quizmasters have historically held office for timespans ranging from a few minutes to several years. The average life expectancy is therefore on the order of a couple of weeks."

It also gets the public involved a little, but making it so people can vote if the Advisor Board goes against him would have the same effect, but with more precision.  Also, what about collateral damage? Are you allowed to kill the Leader's bodyguards? Would blowing up his car with him in it still be illegal, since you're destroying the car?  Is there anything stopping the Leader from declaring it legal to murder members of the Advisory Board?"

There's also the problem that the danger of a call the assassin (It didn't come from France, or from when French was used for everything, so I'm not saying it in French) depends on the number of people against the Leader, rather than the proportion of people against the Leader, so it gets more dangerous as the population grows.

You mean that, and bank accounts? Although bank accounts might lose their value if they lost the cash standard. On the other hand, most of their assets are loans. They only keep a small amount in cash. As long as those loans are still valid, they should be able to give people their money back.  The financial world is playing a game of hot potato with cash. Cash doesn't pay dividends. In fact, it inflates and gets less valuable over time. Businesses buy capital to make more money if they can, and everyone just buys stock or something like that otherwise. The people who aren't wealthy have bank accounts, which are more liquid than stock is but still are used for loans and give interest. All getting rid of cash would do is interrupt cash flow until someone replaces it.  But we're getting rid of bank accounts too. I assume all reliable records of their accounts are destroyed, so the Federal Reserve can't just give the cash back to the banks and fix the problem. Rich people and businesses are largely unhurt. Middle-class people will have to sell stock and rely on money they were saving for retirement. I think poor people would have the biggest problem.  I'd say the government would probably give a certain amount of money to everyone and extend all loans and payments by a certain amount to give people time to get around the cash flow problems.  People would also need to decide on a new form of money. They can just reprint the currency, but they don't know it won't disappear. They could also adopt a currency that didn't disappear, but it might next time. If they can destroy your bank account, who's to say they can't destroy your bitcoin wallet.  That being said, bitcoins are much more resilient. There aren't many reliable records of how much money everyone has in their bank account, but every single bitcoin wallet is a reliable record of everyone with bitcoins. Although people don't exactly have their cryptographic keys memorized. Even so, even if you lose the keys you need to keep using your wallet, as long as people know it's your wallet the government can give you new money.  Perhaps the government would issue its own cryptocurrency."

For instance, if the memory was just 50% randomly then both persons would likely be drooling idiots that can't count to 10. However if it's just a selection of memories of instances (minor or otherwise) then they'd probably function fine.  You have to understand that a lot of who a person is is reliant on their past experiences. If I didn't remember that one time I nearly died in a plane crash, I might not have anxiety about heights or flying. If I forgot how poorly I was treated by strangers when I was younger then perhaps I'd be nicer in general.  In essence no matter how you cut it they're different people. And if you rejoined them they'd become a newer person, different from the original un-divided one because experiences are what make us who we are."

But that's already been said, and the game is more interesting if I assume I can only buy that once, so here's my answer if that's the case.   (-4pts) Oh my god, a magic library containing every book ever published, past, present and future? That's worth way more than 4 million dollars, basement challenge or no basement challenge. Keep in mind for some definitions of ""published"", this may include: lost books from the Library of Alexandria; the original Bible manuscripts; etc. I'm sold. (-4pts) Workshop with unlimited supplies? Absolutely. Using my magic library, I teach myself how to make whatever I want. The sky's the limit. Not only can I make things for myself to make life in the basement easier or more entertaining, but assuming I get to keep what I make after I leave, I can easily make up for some of the 4 million dollars it cost to get this. Absolutely no reason not to take this. This is literally the gift that keeps on giving. (0pts) PewDiePie. Cool, free pseudo-celebrity roommate who I probably share some interests with, gaming-related or otherwise. No-brainer! We'll probably bond and become close friends. ((Edit: never mind. Not spending 1 million dollars on a bed for a stranger.)) (-20pts) Potion of Youth. Obviously. 10 years added to my life expectancy. Complete game-changer. Would buy more if I could. (-7pts) Real life ""bro"" who isn't DTF. So, the thing is... I have a girlfriend. Can I bring her, and just say that for these 7 points, we won't be having sex? If so... (continued below) (-15pts) ...then I note that all of the ""bang this girl"" options are -15 pts, so can I spend 15 in addition to the 7 above and just say that the sex restriction is lifted between me and my girlfriend? Meaning, I have spent 7+15=23 total points to bring ONE person (my girlfriend) with no restrictions? That would be great. If not, then... obviously not cheating on my gf, so not spending these points. (((((After the above six five purchases, I note that I already have my entire A-list with 25 20 points to spare. Everything else is just gravy.))))) (Edit: CRAP. Miscounted, and ended up going 5 over.) (-6pts) Greenhouse. Pricy, but it's my favorite of the sunlight / fresh air options. Tending the greenhouse will be a pleasant way to spend the time. Fresh veggies are awesome. We can even plant and arrange flowers. It's also a nice, large, scenic area I can jog in so I can get my daily cardio without having to buy the gym. (-2pts) Basic hygiene products. I can afford it. (-5pts) The big TV. It's how the gf and I normally spend our time. If we can afford it, let's not go through the pain of changing that habit. (-5pts) The big cable TV package. Better than the movie package, because it includes some movies as well, and we'll probably be spending more of our time marathonning TV shows down here anyway. (-6pts) The PC. Having a computer is huge, but its priority is low on the list. Wish there was a budget option, because I don't need this to be fully decked out, but there isn't, so... (((((Only 1 point negative 4 points remaining, and I need those video games.))))) ...time to cheese the system. (+5pts) HaileTheTurtle. I won't have sex with her, but TECHNICALLY the system says she only has to be DOWN for it in order to not require an additional bed. (-6pts) Video games. (((((Edit: Okay, so as I noted in my edits, I screwed up counting, and went over budget by 5 points. I COULD re-evaluate my choices, but I've already gone through the work, so...))))) (+5pts) Take away 1 million dollars. It pains me, but screw it.   Walk away with 9 million dollars, 10 years NOT counting against my life expectancy spent amassing a wealth of knowledge from my magic library, some new horticultural skills, plus the fruits of my labors in the workshop. I realize I took some major liberties with my interpretation of the rules here, but we can re-fudge the numbers later on to make up for it. This is just a first draft of a proposal.  (Final Edit: I fully intend to exercise / do strength training. But I know how to get a good full-body workout with no equipment. For instance, where there's a door, I can do doorframe rows. I think I have just about everything covered, except health emergencies. For 3 mil, healthcare is probably a smart choice. If I were to do a second draft, I'd probably include that. 10 years is a long time.)  (Final-final posthumous edit: Crap. I never bought food. Okay, so for the first month or so we try to survive on a vegetarian diet. As I struggle to keep my energy going as I do pushups and rows for strength training, my muscles actually atrophy from protein deficiency. We resort to in-fighting and cannibalism. We are dead before the end of year one. RIP me. I'm bad at this.)"

hypotheticalsituation,37k22a,Zulban,1 point,Thu May 28 08:05:03 2015 UTC,"Here are my choices.  I'm actually dropping five million to get an extra 25 points. This isn't a competition to live in a 2x2x2 cage for the most money possible - 5 million is still a ton of money and those 25 points go a long way.  I'm not a greenhouse or a gym kind of guy, but you definitely need those items to maintain your sanity as a mammal/human being. And the gourmet food is an obvious choice over the junk food and crap for the same reasons. This one summer I ate kraft dinner for breakfast, lunch, and dinner most days and it completely wrecked my happiness and well being. Diet is serious business!  The PC rig without games is obvious - I don't game much anymore but I'm a programmer and in ten years I'd make a lot of games and contribute to open source like Godot. The internet is obvious too, even without some loopholes I can think of to make it better. I work in education and can think of ways to still connect to the world in that way.  The well-read girl is another obvious choice. Not sure why anyone would choose anal or fetishes over someone to talk to, read with, have sex with, and watch movies with? Also I think I can handle this solitude okay, but this roommate seems like one of the few who could actually handle the isolation okay as well. I actually have an excellent partner in real life... but I feel this hypothetical is built for single cave dwellers (no option to take current SO), so I rolled with it :o  Actually, my SO would probably lose her mind in this place.  Potion of youth: this is costing me 4 million dollars. Anyone responding here would be crazy not to do this. Not only will you feel better during ""captivity"", and have better sex with your roommate, but living ten years longer is pretty fabulous.

There are a few things here that are no brainers:   penthouse (6): Fresh air and room for others is an absolute must. hygiene(2): Otherwise you get sick easily and everything is disgusting, especially with other people. cell phone (5): i would go insane without outside contact, i am not getting the internet. It is too expensive. bunk, youtubers (5, -15): so all three of the youtube ""celebrities"" that give me points will be included. I am including another woman who will be the dtf one, so all three of these need a bunk (Totaling -10) gun (2): gotta kill those fuckers at first chance, jenna first so i can get my freak on asap without my partner being murdered.   So that is 5 points total so far. Next i will add the brit brunette. In this situation having someone to talk to is more important than sex, which is still very important so i choose her (15).

I need things to clear my head, so kush and booze (8 a piece, total now 52.) and entertainment, a pc, cable tv and games. (6,5,6 respectively.)   And a grand total of 69, where i assume i get an extra $200,000 for leaving a point on the table.  And the more i think about it the more $4mil for 10 years is worth it, so i would give up that money for the fountain of youth potion.

If so, stick dentist offices in orbit. You can now teleport astronauts into space for free, so long as you have a place with no dentist offices in a 250 mile radius. You can also temporarily shut down the office to get astronauts off of the space station.  It's even possible to build a reactionless drive with this (and perpetual motion machine). You could have a spinning spaceship with artificial gravity. You have two offices in it. The dentist owns whichever is currently on the west end of the ship, and the other astronaut owns the one on the east end. They just continually snap their fingers, travel across the north end and get pulled south (and by extension pull the rest of the ship north) and when they get to the east end, teleport back to the west end and start again.

In a notable illustration of the nature of Cold War alliances, the Soviet Union switched from supplying aid to Somalia to supporting Ethiopia, which had previously been backed by the United States.

Population has nothing to do with crime per se.  It is kind of hard to ruin an economy that is already in ruins. I will agree to that.  Okay, I misunderstood. That's a terrible idea! If I was leader of a nation that was in financial chaos and was looking for a fight, the LAST target I would pick was a country that was in good health! Do you think Mexico could become great if they invaded the US? Of course not, it has too many problems both economical and political that keeps them well occupied.

Makes me feel really special, and they totally don't screw over your points if you pretend they don't exist! >_> Secondly, just because a country is poor doesn't mean is has nothing to offer. Do you think resources just magically appear in rich countries? Nations are poor because they don't have the technology or infrastructure to take advantage of its resources. You can destroy a poor country's state, throw in your own tech and reap the rewards. The only way you could even theoretically have a war that is legitimately profitable is if a great nation invades a poor one."
hypotheticalsituation,37grei,BrinkleysUG,3,Wed May 27 14:49:05 2015 UTC,"My knowledge is spotty, do regenerations occur when a being dies of old age? Can a Time Lord even die of old age?  Presumably a regeneration would fix any disability or illness someone suffered, so forced regeneration as a treatment would probably be fairly common. If this is a universe in which humans have always had the ability to regenerate, it's possible medicine would be much less developed, as it would be much less necessary. It would probably be standard practice to carry some record of how many times you've regenerated on your person, so paramedics could make an informed choice about forcing regeneration if you're found injured and incapacitated. Voluntary regeneration would likely still be prohibited in the same way we don't allow underage people to get tattoos or piercings - you shouldn't be making semi-permanent choices about your body until you're mature enough.   Execution - or rather, forced regeneration - is probably more popular and understandable as a punishment. A thirteenth of someone's lifespan is comparatively lenient compared to jail sentences for serious crimes, which take up a much larger percentage of real human lives.   As regenerating humans are much more resilient and long-lived, procreation would presumably be much less frequent, and it's hard to imagine many people staying with one career for their entire lives. If one's personality is as liable to change as the Doctor's is, then even staying with one partner seems like it would be difficult - not to mention, you might meet someone on your third regeneration while they're on their tenth. The way we look at marriage and the family would have to be much more inclusive and varied simply for practical reasons.  I'd like to say that the complication of regeneration would make war less common, but at best it would make violence less lethal. All it takes is a double-tap to kill a regenerating person, and unless there are people on battlefields devoted to getting downed soldiers to a place of safety to regenerate, wartime casualties would likely be about the same. Knowing humans we'd probably invent guns with things like automatic second shots on a brief delay and regeneration-inhibiting smoke grenades.   So to sum up: Good news for the disabled, chronically ill, those unhappy with their bodies, and those that believe in free love. War never changes."

hypotheticalsituation,37grei,JunWasHere,2,Mon Jun 1 14:43:03 2015 UTC,"For those unfamiliar with the ""Time Lord regeneration"" concept, here is the gist of what the OP neglected to explain:   It's a choice, not a passive ability. Regeneration must be triggered consciously, or by another with capability to do so. It is effectively reincarnation with only temporary delirium instead of total memory loss. Regenerating scrambles your senses, physical features, motor functions, and memories on a genetic/neurological level. For all intents and purposes, you have a ""new"" body of which you are entirely unfamiliar. The serial has various examples of the Doctor coping with their new body (like a child learning to walk and what foodstuffs they enjoy) and only fully-adjusting after a day or so. It is a cheat of oncoming death. Due to the nature of #2, any bodily damage you suffered is no more. You are recovered at the molecular level, even radiation damage becomes inconsequential. Note: As implied by #1, you must still be alive to undergo regeneration. Energy propulsion - In the 2005 reboot, regenerations are accompanied by ""regeneration energy"" being emitted from exposed limbs with force varying from a strong draft to full-sized rocket exhaust (but conveniently never destroys one's clothing).  There is residual energy to be processed - Also exclusive to the reboot (as far as I know), for 15 hours, the subject's body retains energy that affords the subject great endurance and offensive capacity - If harmed, another emission can be triggered to restore even a severed limb (and dispatch nearby foes while doing so).     Back to the topic...  Up-side:    Obviously, much longer life technical lifespan. One's birth doesn't define one's self anymore. The changes to body and preference effectively randomize one's disposition enough to pursue other tastes for better or worse, so those inclined can be reborn if weary of their current life.   Down-side:   The criminal justice system becomes ludicrously more hopeless, given everyone now effectively has 12 additional lives, where at the beginning of each additional one, they change face, behavior patterns, and have over a half-day of super human healing and energy propulsion ability. Same with tracking family lineage Overpopulation would steadily become a problem within a century or two. Regeneration may be viewed as the death of one's personality, which can be a sad prospect."

hypotheticalsituation,37i0bd,sound_puppy,6,Wed May 27 19:55:36 2015 UTC,"Well, since wi-fi and cell-phone signals don't actually do anything to organic tissue beyond producing minute amounts of heat, nothing on that order would actually happen. Let me see if I can explain this...   Ohhhhh! Ancient spirits of science, speak through meeee! (dons tiki mask and pocket protector and dances around a crude effigy of Bill Nye) Phencyclidine! Metalloprotease! Eta meson decay! Honorificabilitudinitatibuuuus!  Okay, let's do this.  All our wireless stuff uses short-wave radio technology; it's actually part of the natural range of electromagnetic waves that the earth receives from the sun every day. Short-wave radio is a form of non-ionizing radiation--that means that it doesn't have the quantum oomph to cause chemical changes like more dangerous kinds of radiation. No matter how much of it gets beamed at you, the only thing non-ionizing radiation can do to you is heat the fluid in your body--that's how a microwave oven works. But a microwave oven uses whole orders of magnitude more juice than a cell phone--in fact, you'd receive more heat energy from just holding a bowl of microwaved chicken soup than you do from keeping that phone in your pocket!  When scientists worry about people getting sick from, say, juggling chunks of plutonium, they're worrying about higher wavelengths with a bigger energy punch. That's called ionizing radiation, because it causes ionization events--it knocks around the subatomic particles in your body, causing some elements to turn into other elements. And since the DNA in your cells is just one big, long molecule, ionization events are bad news--the instructions in the DNA get all garbled, and now that cell is cancerous, and can form a tumor. Cancer cells don't remember where they are in your body, or what they're there to do, and they use all the resources your body gives them to reproduce out of control until either the tumor dies or you do.   Enough ionizing radiation at once, and your DNA just starts to fall apart, and even the healthy cells that are left can't reproduce fast enough to replace all the dead ones--that's called acute radiation syndrome, or just radiation poisoning, and it can straight up kill you. Your hair falls out, your organs stop working one by one, and eventually you fall practically to pieces--it's nasty stuff, but something only people who work near fission events on a regular basis have to worry about.  The important thing to remember is that almost nothing you can buy in a mall uses ionizing radiation--some commercial instruments, like some types of smoke detector, use tiny amounts of radioactive elements, but you'd have to buy and take apart an awful lot of them to get enough to hurt yourself, let alone anyone else. So don't worry about the radio waves your phone or router gives off--enjoy the connections this technology gives you! If it weren't for short-wave radio, you'd be tied to a landline--that may not sound like a big deal if you spend your life at a desk, but cellular infrastructure is bringing the internet to places that don't even have phone lines yet! We're living in an age where everyone can talk to everyone else from everywhere--enjoy it!"

If magic--ki, prana, orgone, whatever you want to call it--exists outside of folk traditions and fads, then it's somewhere on the EM spectrum like literally all other matter and energy--and like radio waves. None of it is unnatural--what's being beamed though this hypothetical baby is pure knowledge and thought! Short-wave radio devices carry people's emotions and needs, facts about everything you can imagine, ideas and truths from all over the world!

But it would be like in Avengers, ""code green"" being a special case, because you might not be able to turn him off.  Why anyone would want to use him as a weapon is also a good question.  He is good at smashing and destroying an area, but a bomb would work just as well in most cases.  The Hulk doesn't always kill civilians, but it is a possibility.  A well placed drone strike would probably be a better choice in most cases, all things considered.  So using him as a weapon wouldn't really be a thing, especially considering Bruce Banner wouldn't like being used as such.  If you could harness his power in the style of Hulk powered power plant (tricky to do, considering its the Hulk), then something like this would happen, I imagine.  If you could someone just use the new physics, chemistry, biology that made the Hulk and recreate it (like the rats in that awful first Hulk movie), then I would recommend putting the power into something like nematodes or yeast, and tap into infinite energy that way.  Once infinite energy is a thing, sky is the limit and we would truly enter an age of Post Scarcity.  Think Star Trek.  Now, obviously,  Bad Guys would also be able to use the Hulk Yeast to power bad things.  But there would be much less motivation to do so, because everyone has everything they need and the Good Guys would keep them in check, just like we try to do now.  So the balance between good and evil would be much, much more in the favor of good/peace once Hulk Nematodes then the balance we see today.  Just a couple of thoughts off the top of my head."

It's also worth noting as they trust everything it's likely to be closer to The Invention of Lying where no-one can even really conceive the idea of deception or lying. So the is it deceptive is a check for you to see if it's likely but they presumably wouldn't even consider the deceptive option.

hypotheticalsituation,369rr9,DCarrier,8,Sun May 17 23:27:49 2015 UTC,"Actually, due to Einstein's laws of Special Relativity, nothing would be able to change. Einstein proposed that light and time both 'move' at the same rate. This explained why time slows down for a fast-moving observer: because their speed doesn't change, just their direction. Instead of moving only through time, they would also be moving through space as well, and so they wouldn't be traversing time quite as quickly.  Anyway, because there is only one speed at which everything in the universe in constantly moving, this speed cannot change. Let's say we can measure light moving between points A and B in 2 seconds. Now, in your hypothetical situation, the time light takes is shortened to 1 second, and the speed of light is doubled. (I know you only said slightly more faster, but an exaggeration helps convey the point.) However, time itself still has to move at the same speed as light, because the two are intrinsically linked. So time's 'speed' is doubled as well. Therefore, in what used to be 1 second, two seconds now elapses. So light still takes 2 seconds to get from A to B, and the speed of light cannot be changed."

Suppose RF interacts with matter in the fourth dimension in a manner we cannot directly observe. We have no physical way to prove this directly by observing the matter that RF interacts with. Therefore we must perform the experiment with proper controls and observations in order to adequately disprove my theory.   If you've ever heard of ""the waggle"" dance that bees perform once they find the location of pollen, you'd be interested in how curiously it mimics representations scientists have created with string theory. Bees are quite clearly seeing much more coming from the sun than we are and we can't observe it.  http://discovermagazine.com/1997/nov/quantumhoneybees1263/ Edit: I cannot find the exact article which references what I'm talking about, but what it comes down to is that the path a bee takes while it does it's waggle dance is the same as the shadow of what a 4th dimension looks like when represented in the 3rd dimension according to string theory.

The Louisiana Purchase wouldn't have happened because there's no way France would have sold the land to Britain. Under the British Empire and not needing to gain power by going west, Manifest Destiny doesn't happen and the US only hold Washington (called something else) and Oregon on the west coast.  Britain regains economic stability after the costly Seven Years War, and taxes are lowered. This removes any large scale feelings of independence, as the people feel safer under British rule. Not revolting also means the people retain their sense of Britishness, so the culture of America and that of Canada remains similar to Britain's.  Slavery would have been abolished a lot sooner also, since Britain was one of the first colonial powers to abolish it, although still would have been reluctant.  Well Canada did stay a British colony, so not much would really change for them.  From Britain's point of view, it's argued that not losing the American colonies means Britain wouldn't have pushed into India as much as they did. The War of 1812 would 100% not have happened, which would have increased Britain's power during the Napoleonic Wars, and meant they could field more troops for their (at the time) already small army.  The US would be given the same amount of sovereignty as the other British Dominions, with a Union Jack ensign flag.  World War One would have been finished a lot sooner since the US would have joined day one, instead of right near the end. The US also wouldn't have been supplying the Alliance throughout the war. The Russian Revolution might happen, depending on how fast the war ends. Britain is seen as the unmatched global power, so Germany would want to end the war as quickly as possible. They didn't start the war, and had no reason to continue it. If the war ends before 1917, then the Russian Revolution doesn't happen, or if it does, the Army are there to quell any rebellion.  However the Bolsheviks see the war coming to an end, and see this as the time to strike and launch the revolution sooner, so the Soviet Union is still formed.  After WW1, all the British Dominions are given more sovereignty, and seen as countries in their own right.  WW2 wouldn't have played out much differently, except that the battle of the Atlantic would have been a lot easier for Britain with basically full control over the Atlantic and a bigger navy. The US would again have joined day one instead of 2 years later, and Pearl Harbour would not have happened. However tensions do rise between Britain and Japan, as the growing Japanese Empire is seen as a threat. Japan declares war on Britain, with increased fighting in Burma  With Britain being bombed to shit during the war, much of its industry would have been moved to America, and a lot more of their weapons and vehicles would have been American built. Many evacuees would have also fled to America.  Post-war Britain is a mess, most of the country bombed and and economy ruined by the war. As Britain tries to rebuild itself (with the help of an unharmed America), America rises to be more powerful than Britain. However with the US being in the Commonwealth, the Cold War would be a lot less US-centric, and more Commonwealth centric, with Britain, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand all at the forefront.  The 1950s-60s sees a flag debate in the US, similar to the Canadian flag debate. The Liberal Democrats claim that they need a new flag as they're no longer under Britain and are fully independent. The Conservative Party (not the Republican Party since they have a monarch) say that they can't change the flag since soldiers died under the flag.  Canada and the US remaining under British rule means that the US doesn't pick up much of it's own culture, and so doesn't leak into Canada too. American football either doesn't exist or isn't popular, so rugby becomes the sport of choice in the US and somewhat in Canada. The US also has a big love for Cricket, becoming another colony which beats Britain at it's own sport (sob).  Politically, the US would be a lot more Liberal, to the same level as Britain and the other commonwealth countries today. It has a parliament and House of Commons modelled on the British style of Government."

hypotheticalsituation,362264,Mutant_Llama1,2,Sat May 16 14:41:08 2015 UTC,Good post. I have a few points though.   World War 1 and 2 would have played out completely differently. Since the rebellion supposedly never happens the circumstances that lead to Napoleon's rise to power would also not happen. There would probably still be a French revolution or two and at some point there would be a world war but Europe would be completely different and the circumstances leading up to it would also change. Democracy would take longer to develop. The US sort of jump started the rise of Democracies. Without the revolution it would require a different country to do it successfully so that others follow in it's place. Mexico would probably become the dominate power in the Americas. Likely not as influential as the current United States but certainly more powerful then it is now. As the only independent country in North America they'd likely have their own expansionist era.

I'd tell very few people, just some that I trust. My nemesis would be some telepathic cult leader who convinces people that all music is from the devil.

I try to keep it hidden. It's something rather hard to prove, and bragging about the ability to stalk the dreams of others and gain strength from their nightmares a la Friday the 13th isn't really the best of strategies. At the same time, while it does provide potential benefits towards irl activities like sports and whatnot, there is the whole morality aspect. Villain-superpowers suck.  Again, little to no one, because being able to prove it would basically entail me having to stalk one of their dreams and reveal their personal secrets to them, which sinks a bit too far into creepy territory for my tastes. At the same time, it all depends on the extent the strength-durability-aging aspects of the power go towards. If they become really extreme, then it might be more difficult to hide them than not. I mean ignoring the whole ""detective-that-can-stalk-dreams"" aspect of it, there's the fact that being able to manipulate dreams basically makes every single dream of mine Inception, which is really fucking awesome. Might even spend some time creating my own personal fantasy landscape to retreat to at night, spending years at a time in it. I mean I guess there's the whole ""enter the dreams of others"" aspect, but again that'd get really weird, really quickly. At the same time though, there's another aspect to it. Hot new game developer? Every fucking character of the game leaked. Screenwriters? Whole script on the internet in a few days, tops, to work out the kinks that could be attributed to sheer dream weirdness. Inception-esque manipulation, being able to find out about events before they occur, holy shit this opens up a whole new world.  The dream parts of it are cool, the nightmarish bits less so. I'll probably become super terrified whenever I suddenly gain powerful abilities, basically entailing that someone in my general vicinity is having some really shitty nightmares at the moment. Depending on the range of my abilities, this might be really good or really bad, considering that general bedtimes tend to stretch from 8 PM to 8 AM, in an urban environment I could get some serious boosts.  Another dream-manipulator, likely.    So overall, I'm not all that good of a superhero. As far as my own powers go, it just depends on their extent (maybe you should have thrown in a dice roller for intensity of powers). If I have the powers of all the nightmares in America, or just in my near vicinity, or god forbid the planet. Either way, those powers just amount to being comic-book peak human. Now, with dream entering? That's a whole new field."

Some people try to turn porn into higher art, which is difficult because it causes a fracture between the ""fap-casuals"" and the ""prude-elitists"" a la /r/movie's constant strife between the two similar groups, with one group looking for good fap material flat out and another group looking at how to use porn as a way to convey deeper meaning. This of course leads to accusations that the other group is simply trying to make NSFW movies, not actual porn. Because porn isn't actually a medium like movies and pictures and video games this isn't actually an untrue fact.  So then it comes into question as to if porn really can be an art form if it, by definition, must be in some way arousing rather than simply being NSFW art which at this hypothetical point is already socially accepted. So, in short, all this really means is that porn is socially acceptable.  Then, when studios see a large return in porn movies, we see a large portion of major hollywood studios and actors shifting efforts to porn, which are far less expensive with a larger return, because once porn is socially acceptable it suddenly becomes socially acceptable to charge money for it as is the nature of capitalism.   And then we return to fanbase fracturing as fetishes become subgenres in and out of itself which further fracture, then complaints that the overall quality of porn is declining (though the production value will clearly rise), as studios realize that popular actress + dirty shots = instant cash + no nerd backlash (because they're all busy masturbating). So porn becomes safer and less rough around the edges, at the risk of critical dislike.   And, since porn's large appeal as an industry draws away production value of movies, overall the movie industry takes a big hit as studios stick to fewer really big safe movies a year, taking what little they conserve to make more pornos. This leads to obvious market saturation for both industries and the economic troubles that follow. Smaller indie films and pornos gain a bit more popularity as a general grading scale for porn becomes possible, and tips and tricks around the industry become more well known.   From there, it's difficult to say. All that can be said is that this from here leads to massive changes. Perhaps all of film as an industry collapses and is rebuilt from the ground up around smaller studios. It's likely that a few studios stick with porn making, while other studios refocus their efforts on regular film, with pornos really being a ""once a year"" sort of deal at best, a sort of summer blockbuster as opposed to the current trend of superhero movies.  It's also important to understand that just because porn is socially acceptable doesn't mean that everyone's going to jump on the bandwagon. Chances are Walt Disney Studios isn't going to make pornos. Some of the other major Hollywood studioes might, but again not all. Perhaps not even the majority.   Further down the line, it'll likely lead to a loosening of societal norms on NSFW content. While I can't say whether there'll be a complete breakdown, a full on Sexual Revolution into Eternal September of Free Love like you might think, there will be some slackening of the bounds."

I'll also assume that the effect happens only once to any given person, so that the astronauts on the ISS aren't flipping gender every 90 minutes and so panicked rich people can't switch back by hopping a charter jet to get back ahead of the gender inversion line. Though some will surely try.  A few people actually will escape the gender inversion effect by outracing it, now that I think of it. Once it becomes clear what's happening they can try hopping a plane and flying west, looping around the planet to reach already-affected territory.  Since the effect will hit Asia and Australia first, Europe and Africa have quite a few hours to prepare and the Americas have almost a full day. The Americas are also quite close to the date line, so the most unaffected people will probably be American. Lots of national leaders, probably - they can hop their equivalents of Air Force One and skedaddle.  Here's hoping that China and Russia don't take this as some sort of ""attack"" and go nuclear in a panic.

It would definitely push SRS technology ahead in order to combat the increasing suicide rates as well as spikes in alcoholism and drug use. The deaths in the third world would be astronomical.

I'm going to bring a solid, durable gaming/entertainment laptop.  I'm also going to assume that I have basic wired or USB-chargable peripherals (unfair to expect to have replacement batteries in this case, I'm guessing) including headphones, mouse, and a gamepad.  eBooks - 5gb - Should equal at least 8000-10000 books, including reference, survival manuals, novels, etc.  Lots of philosophical, religious, and academic texts wherever possible.  Anything that challenges you emotionally and intellectually is good.  Plenty of time to read, why not?  You probably wouldn't get to them all, but it would be nice to always know you have options, and they don't take up terribly much room.  Music - 20gb - Enough to maintain variety for several years at a lower bitrate, at least.  Beyond, that, meh - anything would become repetetive.  I'm not going to have great speakers in a laptop, so I sacrifice ~60-70% of the bitrate to save space.  I'd try to include some classical and instrumental music for light background as well.  Movies & Television - 20gb - These are a spacehog, so go for classics and favorites.  Figure with good compression your average film is about 100mb, you get ~200 films or ~400 tv episodes total.  I'd probably include a highly-rewatchable show with strong intellectual and emotional content and characters I care about (West Wing, maybe, MST3K probably), and then mostly favorite movies from throughout my life - classic Star Wars, old B&W classics, etc.  Games & Software - 25gb - Kerbal Space Program, Cities: Skylines, Empire Earth II, Minecraft, Flight Simulator X, Oregon Trail, Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, and some small puzzle games.  On top of that, throw in basically every NES and SNES ROM ever along with emulators for less than a gig.  In making entertainment selections, I'd focus on replayability, variety, and open-ended gameplay, as well as games that tend to keep the mind sharp and focus on skill development and personal enrichment over specific ""challenge"" like FPS and RTS games.  Would throw in some creative software just to give myself an outlet - FLStudio (hey, make new music), maybe Photoshop, definitely a nice word processor application so I can write my desert island memoirs in case I'm ever rescued.  Family Photos & Videos - 20gb - With good compression, you could get thousands of photos and hundreds of hours of home videos.  You're going to get lonely, and that's just the way it is.  ...Adult Entertainment - 10gb - Needs are needs.  Over time, you'll get bored with the stuff you have, which is good, because it leaves things to delete to create space as you need for game saves, documents you create, etc."

hypotheticalsituation,33zsa1,Enigma9994,10,Mon Apr 27 03:58:05 2015 UTC,"Assuming that the winters worsen to the point where we develop the need for hibernation...  The winter of 2015/2016 becomes known as the Worsening Winter, as across the world countries experience longer and more biting winters than ever before. In the far north and south, the winter lasts nearly half a year, but more equatorial countries only experienced a shortly extended winter. It takes nearly 6 winters following the original for humans to develop hibernation patterns, with those in the north hibernating longer than those on the equator. As such, throughout the remainder of the year world businesses convene to discuss plans for mass relocation- less hibernation means more time to operate. After protests from world leaders in Europe and various 'donations' passed around, the conclusion is made that many businesses based in Western Europe and North America will relocate to more equatorial cities.  Like /u/Teh_Mongoose said, businesses moving towards the equator would mean countries like Kenya, DR Congo and the Northern South American nations would become hubs of world commerce. Caracas, Nairobi, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur become the economic heartlands of the world, with Singapore arguably at the forefront of this. Headquarters of banks, corporations and industries are based across Central Africa, Indonesia and South America, and with the new found wealth these nations emerge as the emerging superpowers of the future to rival the USA, UK and China.  Heading north or south of the equator, however, we find nations crippled by the end of their reign over business and the world economy. In particular, cities such as New York and London see massive decline- HSBC relocates their world headquarters from Canary Wharf to Singapore, taking many other banks with it in search of sunlight, leaving The City a shell of the powerhouse of world banking it was. In New York City, businesses like J.P. Morgan follow similarly to HSBC and leave the city for more equatorial opportunities. It goes without saying that thousands lose their jobs and the economies of the northern nations are wrecked.  Riots are widespread across Britain as the 'Banker's Exodus' takes hold- with the economy spiralling deeper and deeper into recession, the Treasury fails to fund projects that have become vital to the British public's way of life, and so thousands take to the streets in protest. The towers of Canada Water and Canary Wharf lie in tatters, a sight mirrored in New York by similar scenes on Wall Street and in the city's former business centres. The only businesses left in the northern nations are ones that cannot afford the exponentially high cost of relocating to the equatorial powerhouses, and the faith of many governments is placed in the hope that these businesses will be the rising stars of the future. But with only half a year, if that, to operate in, it is a far-fetched and ambitious dream.  Of all the 'Northern' nations, China still remains fairly stable. Although it had seen its fair share of damages from relocations, Shanghai remains a leading city for the world economy due to its transportation links to Indonesian cities. As such, business leaders consider it a second haven for establishing business- with links to countries on the equator, paired with lower rent and living costs, many businesses remain in the city and see no real change to their operation.  Of particular note are the central African nations (now collectively known as the African Powerhouse) of Somalia and DR Congo, both of which were infamous before the Worsening Winter for dictatorships and piracy. Somalia spends into the hundreds of millions to eradicate the pirates that had once given the country a bad name, largely funded by the establishment of MetLife's African Headquarters in Mogadishu. However, strict regulations on business in the Congo means that businesses that relocated into the country faced tough control by the government. It soon becomes clear that the nation will not be as prosperous as its neighbours so long as a dictator reigns, and as word spreads amongst the people rebellions begin to take place. A bloody rebellion ensues, lasting several years until an international intervention installs a democratic government- The newly created 'Congo Republic' begins on the path to wealth, slightly behind its neighbours but with similar ambition."

I suspect I could build the whole damn thing out of wood, if necessary.  I'm not going for 21st century presses, I'm going for Gutenberg grade, just 340 years early."

Original question was however about convincing them that ""Im from the future"" and this would not work for reasons previously stated.  The idea that ""future will be more technological/advanced"" did not exist until late 1600 at the very best. People were more likely to believe that ""technological advancement"" (not that they would have such a term) happened not in the somewhen else in the future, but somewhere else, in a land far away (for example the idea of the ""Kingdom of Prester John"" is based on such kind of thinking).
