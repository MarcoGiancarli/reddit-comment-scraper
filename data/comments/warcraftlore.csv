warcraftlore,3e5rkw,Slothy22,8,Wed Jul 22 04:14:37 2015 UTC,"In The Underbog dungeon, I'm pretty sure there is a Druid that accidentally gets himself tamed while he is in bear form and he just makes growling noises.   Unless a Druid can shapeshift itself some humanoid vocal cords, lorewise I don't think shapeshifted Druids probably can speak."
warcraftlore,3e5rkw,chipwhitley63,3,Wed Jul 22 04:23:39 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about that Druid, but I wasn't sure if he couldn't talk just because he couldn't, or because he had been tamed by that Hunter.  I guess it does make sense that they can't, unless they could somehow shapeshift proper vocal cords, like you said."
warcraftlore,3e5rkw,Vineares,5,Wed Jul 22 04:35:22 2015 UTC,In Warcraft 3 there were the druids of the claw (If I remember correctly) who were unable to shapeshift to humanoid forms and were unable to communicate.
warcraftlore,3e5rkw,vhisic,2,Wed Jul 22 06:30:39 2015 UTC,"You could assume so, there was a point in vanilla where as a druid you couldnt talk to humans as in hand in quests ect you would get an error something along lines of  ""you cannot talk while shapeshifted""."
warcraftlore,3e5rkw,FrosthawkSDK,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:18:03 2015 UTC,"Obviously in gameplay they can.   In lore I'd hazard a guess that they can communicate using their magic and can make animal noises with their actual vocal cords.   As for things like the tamed Druid in Underbog and the feral Claws in the Barrow Deeps, I think that probably has more to do with them compulsively behaving like animals than with them being unable. When was the last time you saw a bear use magic to speak?"
warcraftlore,3e5rkw,Gnarwhalz,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:40:04 2015 UTC,"Funny enough, in Vanilla (and for a while following, can't remember when it was changed) you could do very little when it comes to interacting whilst in shapeshift form. No flight paths, no quests, no vendors; nobody could be spoken with until you hopped out of shapeshift. You couldn't even /say.  And boy, am I glad they changed it."

When Kil'rogg does the ritual, he sees himself dieing in a giant outside battle with tons of orcs, but when we kill him he's pretty much alone in his room. What he saw was not what actually ended up happening, possibly because he joined Gul'dan because he thought it would cause his vision to happen, but it ended up changing his fate. The fate we see is probably what could happen if we failed to stop the legion on Draenor or something. That said, it is interesting that it is in Undercity and not Orgrimmar for Horde, so maybe there is something to it."

warcraftlore,3e243n,Blisteringbarnac,18,Tue Jul 21 10:57:17 2015 UTC,Well they are the oldest and most powerful of all troll tribe and they've had their magic figured out for thousands of years. Could be natural evolution coupled with their magic to augment themselves.  Or it could just be models to differentiate them from the other tribes in the raid. Back in Vanilla the Zandalari all looked the same as the other trolls.
warcraftlore,3e243n,RufinTheFury,5,Tue Jul 21 11:06:57 2015 UTC,Just ingame questions: Wasn't the bulkier troll model added in TBC with the Amani? I know the Zul'Farrak trolls still have the same model as Darkspears. What about the forest trolls in UBRS LBRS? Did they have the original model like Darkspears?  Edit: Wrong dungeon acronym
warcraftlore,3e243n,Lunux,4,Tue Jul 21 16:12:03 2015 UTC,I know the Amani got bulked up for their raid but I'm pretty sure the forest trolls remained the same. I'm no expert though.

warcraftlore,3e243n,Lunux,12,Tue Jul 21 16:54:24 2015 UTC,"Trying to recall what Blizzard had said when Isle of Thunder was incoming.   If memory serves, The Zandalari are what Trolls once were. Over the centuries, the Trolls as we know them came about - diminished from the Zandalari ""start point.""  Unfortunately, I think Loreology had answered this, and he deleted his Twitter. But generally, Blizzard's really bizarre understanding of evolution explained it as Zandalari becoming ""bent"" over the centuries as the Trolls ""diminished"".  Technically, the only reason the Zandalari in Vanilla look like regular trolls is because Blizzard didn't have the art for it. They made time in 5.2 https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/314752301250273281    Edit: Here is a Know Your Lore from back in the day. http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/10/know-your-lore-the-zandalari/"
warcraftlore,3e243n,araquen,8,Tue Jul 21 12:13:04 2015 UTC,"I would imagine that the Zandalari are more closely related to Night Elves, aka the tribes of Dark Trolls that settled near the shores of the Well of Eternity."
warcraftlore,3e243n,chipwhitley63,3,Tue Jul 21 15:52:50 2015 UTC,"That has been irking me for the longest time. Because it says something demeaning about Trolls that exposure to the Well of Eternity kind of ""prettied"" them up (and gave them extra fingers).    I still have issues with the extra fingers (hence my comment about Blizzard's bizarre understanding of evolution, since more evolutionary pressures reduce 5 digits down to 3, they don't take 3 and add 2), but if we can assume Dark Trolls are more akin to the Zandalari (and not modern Trolls), then I can definitely see how the Well would have ""evolved"" the Night Elves.   So yeah, I'd definitely say your thoughts on the matter are plausible, even if the original Warcraft kind of has them looking like regular Trolls http://wowwiki.wikia.com/Dark_troll Blizzard has always maintained they have the right to retcon."
warcraftlore,3e243n,araquen,9,Tue Jul 21 16:02:45 2015 UTC,"I definitely accept the concept that exposure to Arcane magics 'pretty up' a race, evolutionarily, over time. Magical prowess and physical beauty often come hand in hand, namely with Azshara. Further Arcane exposure transformed the Highborne into the High Elves, so that makes sense too."
warcraftlore,3e243n,chipwhitley63,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:47 2015 UTC,"I think (and this coming from someone whose main is a Night Elf Druid and really only plays Night Elves), that it is slightly insulting to Trolls that their physiques are ""inferior."" Not that you're wrong, just that it is a bit of a crummy message Blizzard is sending that Trolls weren't ""good enough"" and needed to be ""cleaned up.""    But if we assume Dark Trolls look more like the Zandalari (as /u/chipwhitley63 postulates), then the ""prettying up"" makes more sense. You then get the regular Trolls as a ""diminishment"" of the Zandalari and the Night Elves as a ""mutation"" of the Dark Troll kin.    In any event, I think it is high time Blizzard lets up peek behind this curtain in-game, since we've seen Orcs, Humans, Dwarves and Gnomes, and Helfs/Belfs are already accounted for."

warcraftlore,3e243n,TweetsInCommentsBot,7,Tue Jul 21 12:13:10 2015 UTC,There was a book about Vol'jin's time in Pandaria that explained it. If I remember right Darkspear trolls hunch over to not humble the other races on how tall they really are. The Zandalari don't care about the other races and stand upright to show their superiority.
warcraftlore,3e243n,ihatejeeps,4,Tue Jul 21 14:34:28 2015 UTC,Did they mention Female trolls?
warcraftlore,3e243n,Kronos86,5,Tue Jul 21 19:42:20 2015 UTC,"No I don't believe so. I believe they were only talking about male trolls seeing as male trolls, if standing upright are taller than tauren."

History joke aside, because they are historically aware and are doing very much to prevent history from repeating itself, they are focused on a very specific thing.

I believe there was a book during MoP where Vol'Jin claimed the other troll tribes hunch to not tower over the other races, and evolved to the point where it became natural. Zandalari are very proud, and like to look down upon the other races."

warcraftlore,3e1pgi,Asgathor,12,Tue Jul 21 07:35:00 2015 UTC,"The orcs have slaughtered a lot of Draenei. Thrall was right to be afraid. While Velen is compassionate and does not truly hate the orcs for what they did, others, like Maraad, hate orcs with every fiber of their being. Thrall's assessment is not wrong; he would have great difficulty conducting peace talks with a race so savagely slaughtered by his people, and the Alliance took the Draenei in as members right away."
warcraftlore,3e1pgi,ByronicWolf,9,Tue Jul 21 14:10:01 2015 UTC,The Draenei sided with the alliance due to the starting area quest line. And Horde and Alliance is at war! This was also done before the book.
warcraftlore,3e1pgi,Qaanaaq,8,Tue Jul 21 07:59:57 2015 UTC,Honestly I think the line our greatest enemy might be a bit of an exaggeration. It's true that once the Draenei knew what was going on and the elements abandoned the Orcs the Draenei actually started to win the majority of the confrontations - but the whole warlock/demonblood thing put a stop to that.   Try to look at this from Thrall's perspective though. He finally has some fragile peace with the Alliance. This despite allying with the Darkspear Trolls and Forsaken. He has set up a new home in Durotar and even has small logging rights granted by the Night Elves in Ashenvale.   Then the Draenei crash land right into the Alliance laps and quickly makes allys of them. Jaina sends aid before Thrall even hears about it. And o man do the Draenei have a story to tell.   Now think about this from the Draenei perspective. They've had their people cut down to a very small fraction. They endure the hell we haven't seen since in lore. And now they find out the Orcs are here on this planet.   Thrall realizes the Draenei story could make this whole peace thing go away. In the words of Deathbringer Saurfang - things are about to get much worse.  The Draenei are enemies at this point in time for no other reason than the Orcs did something they (the Orcs) think will be avenged. This is how an Orc thinks. They are expecting revenge. It isn't until later they learn what it means to be Draenei.
warcraftlore,3e1pgi,quadriviumed,6,Tue Jul 21 16:32:41 2015 UTC,"I think he meant specifically Velen. If I remember correctly he states that there are various Draenei on Azeroth and that's not a big deal, but once the informant mentions Velen, is when he starts to worry.   I think it's mainly because, through no fault of his own, Velen was the reason the orcs destroyed their homeland almost destroyed themselves.   It also doesn't help when your enemy gains a powerful ally, especially one who's people were slaughtered and drove away by your (not Thrall, the orcs) doing."
warcraftlore,3e1pgi,Illmattic,9,Tue Jul 21 13:45:56 2015 UTC,"I... don't think Thrall knew any Draenei until Burning Crusade... Anyway, Rise of the Horde is set on Draenor before The Dark Portal is opened."
warcraftlore,3e1pgi,tagey,6,Tue Jul 21 10:12:45 2015 UTC,"The only Draenei he knew were Lost Ones. That's what it says in Rise of the Horde, in the Epilogue. Rise of the Horde is indeed a story set on Draenor, but it is written as if Thrall told the story. In the Epilogue, he is disturbed while writing by a spy, who tells him about Velen. Thrall probably did not know any Draenei before the landing of Velen, in the sense of knowing them personally. He did know of the Lost Ones, the ones wandering and yearning, but without leadership (so, non-Velen)."
warcraftlore,3e1pgi,TheSimmies,4,Tue Jul 21 14:12:18 2015 UTC,"The simple and easy answer is that the Draenei joined the Alliance, their enemy. Typical story tailored around the faction war that hasn't always made sense. Kinda like the stuff around the Sunwell, we're working with both Velen and Lady Liadrin, the leaders of races on opposing factions, and still the Blood Elves of Silvermoon are at war against the Draenei. These are kind of the things you have to suspend belief and rational thought on for the sake of the story. The two factions have been at war mostly although sometimes they have worked together briefly like the Wrathgate and this current expansion. It's kind of up to how the writers feel about the attitudes between the Alliance and Horde."
warcraftlore,3e1pgi,Lunux,4,Tue Jul 21 16:07:24 2015 UTC,You know what? Fuck the Draenei. They know the Legion destroys the worlds they land on yet they planet hop across the universe dooming every race on every planet they go. Velen knew damn well that coming to Draenor would spell disaster for the orcs.
warcraftlore,3e1pgi,cedarbabe,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:06:42 2015 UTC,Which clearly means that the genocide committed upon them was a-fucking-okay.

warcraftlore,3e1pgi,eonge,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:36:00 2015 UTC,"The Legion destroys every world anyway. That's kinda it's whole point. Those worlds wouldn't magically be safe if the Draenei didn't arrive. The Draenei are the only ones with a plan, an Army of the Light that can counter the Legion. Sure, maybe each planet will fall like the last but maybe, just maybe spreading the word of the Light across the cosmos might be able to stop the Legion. Maybe teaching the Xxloris about the Light will let them fight against the Legion, deal some sort of blow. Maybe every few worlds a race will take up the mantle of the Light and fully annihilate a Pit Lord, or a lesser Eredar from existance itself. Maybe, if they run, they could find a world where races could not only fight the Legion, but hold it back, stop them from entering the world. A world that could become a bastion of Light in darkness. A world that could be a staging ground for something greater.  What other choice do they have? Join the madness they seek to evade? Sure, assuming the Eredar even let their ""fallen"" brothers join the Legion (instead of, you know, torture their souls for all eternity) it just goes against their nature, the nature of everything they fought for, everything the Naaru instilled in them. Respect for life. They could kill themselves enmasse, but what would that accomplish? Deny the universe one of the few hopes against a numberless mass of destruction?   To go the metaphoric route (because, yeah, all media entertainment IMO is some form of reflection on the human condition, even WoW): The Draenei are meant to represent, or teach, perseverance against inescapable dread. Think about it, you could just as easily ask ""why not kill yourself right now"" to yourself, who is going to die anyway, as to a Draenei who while technically immortal is being hunted by an overwhelming force. It's the humility in knowing that all life has an end, but needs a purpose, a goal to achieve, a way to fight against injustices. Sure, zealotry exists even within the Draenei, and there are many who call out for Horde blood, the dismantling of the Horde, the confinement of it's people, just as in life there are faults in all things (there is a crack, a crack, in everything, that's how the Light comes in...) but the Draenei represent that, even when all hope is lost and you find yourself in blackness, you can, even you must keep going because it could, it must get better, you just need to keep going to see it.  Every character has flaws. Velen's is his willingness to sacrifice. He sacrificed his people at Shattrath to allow the others to escape. He sacrificed his (alt) self to save his own people. Sacrifice can be as much a bane as a boon, obviously, especially when it is your main function for righting wrongs.   Oh, and also IIRC, not every world they land on is destroyed by the Legion immediately. If they move house before the Legion catches them, then the trail runs cold as it were. Draenor was found relatively early, by chance, in the Draenei's traveling pattern."
warcraftlore,3e1pgi,Bridgeru,3,Wed Jul 22 04:05:48 2015 UTC,"Could have something to do with the wholesale slaughter and genocide of their people coupled with using biological (demonic) warfare on the draenei turning a bunch of them into broken.  That sort of thing kinda leaves a mark.  In AU, they halted the worst of the atrocities (velen saved karabor) so the hatred is not as strong. I am sure there is individual distrust of each side but politically they are not at war any longer."
warcraftlore,3e1pgi,Watcher_woman,3,Tue Jul 21 16:44:03 2015 UTC,"The Orcs one committed one of the greatest atrocities known - the genocide on the Draenei.  Back when the Draenei arrived on what they would call Draenor, as refugees hunted by the Burning Legion, relations with the native Orcs weren't hostile for the most part. After all, there was no reason for hostilities -- all the Draenei sought was refuge and peace, whilst the Orcs weren't conquerors back then. They were tribes of shamans, hunters and warriors that fought against the Ogres, The Draenei even abandoned the Genedar, the very ship they fled Argus in, in favour of the Orcs who revered it as Oshu'gun. The Draenei settled where they wouldn't get into the Orc's way and traded with them.  That all changed however when Kil'Jaeden learned of the Dranei's refuge and manipulated Ner'zhul into leading the Orcs to war against them. Unsuccessfully at first when the Draenei showed superiority. However, when the Orcs took the Demon Blood, the table turned and the Orcs committed a monstrosoty.  The Draenei were forced into hiding until Tempest Keep arrived with the Exodar. Eventually, they crashed on Azeroth, the very planet their nemesis had become refugees on. The Horde already was in a dire state and could hardly maintain peace with the Alliance. The Orcs didn't have the power of the Demon Blood anymore, and now those who were almost able to beat them had arrived and joined their enemy. The genocide is still not forgotten."
warcraftlore,3e1pgi,Pinkastrasza,2,Tue Jul 21 23:22:22 2015 UTC,"Probably because the Orcs committed genocide on 3/4ths of their race, and mutated a portion of the remaining quarter.

So think Witch Doctor from D3, with a little bit of Demon Hunter and Shaman mixed in.   The abilities will likely be very interesting, voodoo magic and interaction with the Loa are some abilities the WoW classes haven't really touched on (unless you assume Druid/Priest/Shaman trolls draw on that, but none of it is Voodoo at least)"

Very eager to see what Vol'jin and Malfurion do as well.   I haven't played WoW seriously in about a year and been unsubbed for the last 5 months. I think gameplay wise it could be promising. I think Blizzard realized how much it hurt them by Xing out faction capitals in WoD. The new class perks me up to get back into WoW. But other than that it seems Pirates will replace Garrison missions and heroes, which while I understand the appeal for Garrison Missions, they weren't for me.   I think if this is true, Blizz needs to stick to this plan. They can't have another WoD where they say one thing leading up to expansion and then back out of it.   Overall, if this is true, this will get me to resub to experience the new class and Lore. But unfortunately, I think the time to revitalize WoW has been long passed, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think Blizz would be pleasantly surprised to how many people would really appreciate the next step in Warcraft's journey."

warcraftlore,3durpw,SnowyWeather31,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:20:48 2015 UTC,"well night elfs didn't exactly come from trolls as we know it. In the time before time there was a sort of tribal feral nocturnal humanoid that roamed the land. A few of them made their way to the enchanted well of eternity. Over time the cosmic powers of the well affected the tribe making them more into the elves we know.  So the elves did not evolve directly from what you think of as the trolls today. More like they share a common ancestor, a primal child of the titans left behind after they spread life across the land.  you're taking it too literally and thinking about it narrow mindedly  i could imagine them looking like this http://orig00.deviantart.net/b0e4/f/2009/349/0/a/avatar_by_patrickbrown.jpg  And the trolls never leaving their savage ways or gaining wisdom from the magic pools evolving to what they are today"

warcraftlore,3dtpfs,bauss9027,4,Mon Jul 20 18:54:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah he was. That's why he's got such an interest in Gul'dan, because Medivh, his teacher, talked to our Gul'dan a whole lot and all of that invasion-planning happened right under Khadgar's nose. That's why he's so adamant in stopping Gul'dan and seeking more power, because he doesn't want to let Gul'dan win again. There's no secret ""Khadgar is actually Medivh"" conspiracy, because it wouldn't make sense. Why would Medivh take on Khadgar's form? Khadgar's still alive and prior to WOD he was leading the stuff in Shattrath. It's quite normal that our ""Outland Expert"" would accompany us to a ""pre-Outland"" world. And Medivh was, prior to WOD, ""dead"" or at least some sort of ghostly otherworldly being of benevolence. He came back in WC3 to set things in motion and in the end he succeeded. There's no point in him, the mysterious prophet, to take on a clever disguise if he'd REALLY want to come back from his ghostly realms to do some good. He'd just come back as Medivh. And making him come back as an evil Medivh who wants to double-cross us all would really break the character. He had his ""good guy - bad guy - good guy"" arc already. And don't get me started on ""Alternate Azeroth Medivh"". He's got no business in any of it, since he would've visited us before Garrosh's Iron Horde Vanguard was even in the Blasted Lands and giving Alternate Medivh also time travel would really trivialize time travel to a point where Sargeras himself should just use the Doctor Who phone booth to beam right into Stormwind City."

warcraftlore,3dtpfs,fruitymasta,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:40:08 2015 UTC,Actually they turn into ravens not crows. Personally think the reason for this has always been more rooted in symbolism than anything. Medivh first started transforming into a raven after his resurrection and I believe the raven was used by blizz to symbolize wisdom/clarity since he was then free of Sargeras' possession. For Khadgar(if actually is Khadgar) I think it's more just a link/nod to his old mentor. As for the 'how' I'm not sure there is any more addressing it aside from a general 'it's because they're such powerful/skilled mages'.   Personally I really wish Khadgar turns out to be Medivh in disguise.
warcraftlore,3dvhcr,IllidanS4,2,Sun Jul 19 21:33:36 2015 UTC,"The only other instance of usage of an Altar of Storms that I can think of is the example most of us will know them best by, the way they were used throughout the Warcraft III campaign:   During the Third War, many of the Altars of Storms were retooled by troll masons to channel shamanistic energy in order to revive fallen heroes. [1]   Considering usage on other creatures:   The Altars are avoided by the rest of the Horde as the intense energies that emanate from their cold surfaces can be… unhealthy.   There doesn't seem to be a ready explanation for this, but I can imagine the brain-enhancing capabilities only work when used on certain types (or sizes) of intelligent creatures. Apparently using them on more intelligent species than Ogres has detrimental side-effects, and there are no sources that speak off the use on other less-intelligent creatures that I know off. The fact that Ogre-magi had some magical affinity beforehand could definitely play a role."
warcraftlore,3dvhcr,SaurfangtheElder,2,Mon Jul 20 10:16:22 2015 UTC,"What would the effects look like?   Don't mind if I invite myself in to play. I love to speculate!   Building My Case:  Using the Altar, Gul'dan was able to produce two-headed Ogres. Having a second head made them more intelligent.   Altars have been re-purposed to revive the dead as well. I think therefore it is reasonable to accept that the Altars are capable of harnessing tremendous power such as enhancing the will of the user. Perhaps their function has some relationship to the magical ley lines. Or not.  All we know for certain is that they do three things: make ogres smarter, revive the fallen, and attract elementals and ogre magi (the same ogres altered by the devices).  Compiling Speculation from Precedent:  So there is the possibility that the Altars are not themselves magical, but act as channeling devices. In this sense they are like 3D printers. They are powered by magic rather than electricity, and can be used to make/do a wide variety of things.   Altars would be more-or-less harmless were it not for the fact that any old fellow with access and some knowledge could be dangerous, much like the one-shot 3D printed gun. And the analogy breaks here because of the footnote in the linked gamepedia article on Altars. Being near them can be harmful. Somehow.  Ogre Magi and Elementals are attracted to them. Shamans use them to revive so they must have some interaction with the elements. Ogre Magi were exposed to them. This is where I get really deep into the speculation and why I mentioned Ley Lines.  A normal being can live directly on top of a Ley Line with no effect. And at a convergence of Ley Lines one can construct a place of great power such as Karazhan. I think the Altars are Ley Line manipulators. They channel magical energy unnaturally. Hence their dangerous nature and great power.  Deep We Go:  So how would other races be affected? It depends on the user's intent and ability. Someone like Gul'dan was able to create Wizards from Morons. Other Orcs were able to raise in a way I can only assume to be akin to a perfected Human Transmutation from Fullmetal Alchemist. This means repairing tissue and calling the soul back from wherever it had gone. That is a lot of power! Revival is not a common ability in Azeroth, unlike how gameplay mechanics would suggest.  Beings could be altered greatly and with a variety of changes.  An Orc could be transformed beyond a Hulking Fel Orc into a warrior of tremendous strength. A Human might be given Guardian-like powers.  An already formidable being might become a demigod. But Gul'dan's efforts to produce Ogre Magi gives us another hint:  Gul'dan was never hungry for leadership. He wanted power. Why would he not enhance himself? If there are uses beyond changing Ogres, such a being would surely be able to figure this out. Hell, Gul'dan would kill an alternate reality version of himself if he knew the skull was contained power.  So the operator cannot also be the subject. And it is less far-fetched to see Gul'dan as being distrustful than incompetent. He might over-reach, but he would never balk at power.   So only those forced or trusting can be subjects. And they cannot be their own operators. It is something like heart surgery in that regard. A world-renowned surgeon with ticker trouble still needs another steady hand wielding the scalpel on his or her behalf.  Who would you trust to tinker with your life using mysterious magic?"

While it is true that Aethas looked the other way regarding the whole affair at the time, Lor'themar only became involved in the matter to try and mitigate the damage done.  After the Sunwell was reignited, only a fraction of Blood Elves continued to suck on fel energy popsicles. This was back at the end of TBC, by the way. The purge of Dalaran happened 3 expansions (aka years?) afterwards.  The continuing omnipresence of the green crystals in Silvermoon is probably due to the same factors that prevent flying mounts from flying in the TBC races' starting areas.

warcraftlore,3dp3v6,ColCyclone,19,Sat Jul 18 06:19:45 2015 UTC,"I read it a year or so ago, and gave it a quick reread.  It is set between the ending to the Burning Crusade expansion and right after the pre-launch event for the Wrath of the Lich King expansion. The Horde is now set to march to Northrend.  Meaning, the only trace of Pandaria is the tales of Chen Stormstout and the barrels of ale he left behind, and Garrosh is merely the now-hotheaded son of Grom that nobody even mentions in the book. Odds are only Sylvanas even knows about him that point. All he had done by that point in time is be depressed about what Grom did, and hanging around Thrall after he showed him what Grom did to undo what he had done.  It's about Lor'themar's discomfort with his seat of power, how Archmage Sunreaver's passion got him his position as top Horde guy in Dalaran, about Sylvanas's influence over the Sin'dorei due to the Forsaken contingent in the Ghostlands's importance, and that Lor'themar is apparently willing to go to great lengths to ensure his people's safety. This last detail could also be said about any of the other racial/faction leaders, from Vol'jin to Aysa Cloudsinger, from Taran Zhu to General Nazgrim.  The only part that could be construed to mean that Lor'themar was all aboard Operation Getbellthroughdalaran was, and I'm quoting:   But seeing as any number of sin'dorei forces will shortly be heading north, I expect many of them will likely end up on your doorstep. You will do what you can to aid them, Aethas.   and that is a leap so huge not even Diablo 2 barbarians can accomplish. The Sin'dorei, and other members of the Horde, had their own quarter in the city and were allowed access to and liberty to move around the ""trading quarter"" and underbelly. We are told that this is possible due to Archmage Sunreaver's efforts in the Sunreavers faction's ingame description.  Until the purge happens, any and all blood elven and non blood elven Horde members are allowed into the city.  Entry 83 in his journal goes to cement the fact that he does do a lot of posturing and getting in bed with folks he would much rather not, no matter who they are or were. And, considering all he had to do to get them where they were at the time (which is explored in the short story), it's not hard to see why he does it and why he dislikes it.  It in no way implies his involvement with the Bell situation and its consequences."

I enjoyed the concept, Horde and Alliance full scale war brings them to mysterious continent. But the Asian theme just really took me out of the game and did not give me that ""warcraft"" feel that I've always loved from the Warcraft games.   My other issue was that every zone felt too similar to me. What I loved about Wrath was how every zone kept with this ""artic"" theme(sans scholozar basin) while still feeling very unique in atmosphere. The troll zone was awesome, Howling Fjord gave you the beautiful side of Northerend while Borean Tundra showed you the dying side. Storm Peaks allowed you to see all about the Titans and that side of the lore, or you could level in Icecrown and experience the scourge side of the lore.

warcraftlore,3dp3v6,NBF1865,9,Sat Jul 18 15:31:34 2015 UTC,"Neither of them are sympathetic to me. Illidan knew what he was getting into, and Arthas was a spoiled son of a king who went apeshit because no one was doing what he wanted to do."
warcraftlore,3dp3v6,eonge,4,Sat Jul 18 22:35:28 2015 UTC,Please elaborate on Arthas. What gives you that idea?
warcraftlore,3dp3v6,cattaclysmic,5,Sat Jul 18 22:40:50 2015 UTC,"He strips Uther of his rank and horribly lashes out at Jaina when she confronts him on this, sets sails to Northrend with a fleet all without even talking to his father.  I find Arthas totally unsympathetic.  I can't speak for the poster above you, though."
warcraftlore,3dp3v6,eonge,4,Sun Jul 19 00:17:48 2015 UTC,"But that was after Arthas' fall from grace had already begun. He had to purge Stratholme and the two people he thought he could rely on, his lover and his mentor, won't help him do what must be done - and even worse, they chastise him for doing it. After having to purge a city of living and undead - which as a Paladin is extra hurtful to his core beliefs - he is goaded by the one responsible to follow him to Northrend.   And you don't understand why he went to Northrend? He was just betrayed by his 2 best friends, and risked his father telling him no making not only all he went through for naught, but also allowing Mal'ganis to grow stronger still and many more Stratholmes to pop up."
warcraftlore,3dp3v6,arcadianprince,3,Sun Jul 19 00:48:15 2015 UTC,"He was not betrayed. At all. He, having been shown more than Jaina or Uther, the horrors of the plague, has knowledge they lack. He responds by deciding to purge the city. They express a horror at this and saying there must be some other way. Arthas then goes on to strip Uther of his rank just because he expressed doubt in Arthas. Not to mention that after Hearthglen he lashes out at Uther needlessly. His descent had already begun by this point.  I fully know why he went to Northrend. But he was not betrayed by his friends. The only sympathetic part of his story I can find is that he was targeted to be Ner'zhul's host long before the Scourging of Lordaeron even began. That might forgive his actions before being completely taken by Ner'zhul."
warcraftlore,3dp3v6,purifico,3,Sun Jul 19 01:06:04 2015 UTC,"He didn't express doubt in Arthas, he told him that he would not follow the order to purge the city, even if he were already king. Of course some people would disagree with Arthas' command, but that's the beauty of being in command. You have the final say.  Bottom line, Uther did betray Arthas, because he blatantly disobeyed an order from his prince. The Crown Prince.   Arthas is a sympathetic villain in the same way that Darth Vader is/was. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.   Who can say that they've never tried to do something good, and had it end up going awry? Arthas started his descent by wanting to save his kingdom and his people. Along the way, he fell from grace. That is the very archetype of a sympathetic villain, because we can relate to them. Most of us have something we would go to any ends to achieve, or protect, or what have you.   Arthas just happened to fall off the high road and land smack-dab on the road to hell along the way."
warcraftlore,3dp3v6,NBF1865,2,Sun Jul 19 13:33:50 2015 UTC,"Arthas is a way more sympathetic villain.   no he isn't. the second you start butchering people ""for greater good"" is the second you need to be put down like a rabid dog that you are. He's a spoilt brat that needed to be bitch slapped right there in Stratholme and put in a corner with no dinner. I blame Uther for going easy on him."
warcraftlore,3dp3v6,KTY_,3,Mon Jul 20 07:57:31 2015 UTC,"He needed to be ""bitch slapped?"" I sincerely hope you're not a guy. Furthermore I love the people who think Stratholme was the defining moment for Arthas's evilness. It was the defining moment for his pragmatism. If he hadn't done what he had then Lordaeron would have just ""butchered"" the zombies. Seriously. What's the difference between killing someone five minutes before they become a zombie and killing a zombie? Do you also feel everyone who participates should get a medal so you don't hurt their feelings? There are lots of dark decisions that go into leading people that everyone else loves to judge until they're the one having to make the call. And, not for anything, but this idea of Arthas being a spoiled brat didn't come around until Blizzard wanted everyone to think it in WotLK so Arthas could be more unlikeable (that's also why he got a new voice that was darker in the Stratholme instance and not the original sound clip from WCIII like they did Uther). If you read any of the original literature on him before WotLK they describe him as incredibly hardworking, which is why he's the youngest inducted into the Order of the Silver Hand (no, not because he's the prince), and extremely sympathetic and loving towards his people, which is why he's willing to go to such great lengths to save them. Not unlike Ner'zhul who was wise and loving and because of this considered the closest to a chieftain to all the orcs before the Horde. This is what makes them tragedies, driven by love they fall from grace. I suppose you think Darth Vader needs a ""bitch slap"" too then?"

warcraftlore,3dp3v6,barechips,17,Sun Jul 19 05:29:40 2015 UTC,"Wrath was my favorite because of it's atmosphere.   Some of the lore was pretty crap, like how the Lich King was a Saturday Morning Cartoon Villain. But lots of it was really cool like the Muradin quest line and Ulduar and the Watchers.  The best thing though was the atmosphere. The Alliance and Horde both felt like they were on a crusade, but they did it using their themes. The Vrykul were awesome. Ulduar, Argent Tournament, Dalaran, the Nexus, all those places just felt incredible."
warcraftlore,3dp3v6,ShepardfucksEVERYONE,12,Sat Jul 18 07:19:13 2015 UTC,Ulduar was incredible
warcraftlore,3dp3v6,Vaeku,7,Sat Jul 18 07:54:53 2015 UTC,"How was the lich king a cartoon villain? A fallen hero corrupted by the endless power offered by a force of nature, bound to the will of a long dead orc cheiftain warped by kil'jaeden."
warcraftlore,3dp3v6,cattaclysmic,15,Sat Jul 18 22:14:47 2015 UTC,"I think he's talking about the fact that throughout the expansion we kept running into him only for him to run away twirling his mustache saying that he'll get us next time, etc. Then it was revealed that he was just taunting us and doing it on purpose so that the greatest heroes would be at his doorstep."
warcraftlore,3dp3v6,bauss9027,7,Sat Jul 18 22:36:51 2015 UTC,I remember reading Blizzard had him show up everywhere because they didn't want an absent villain.

warcraftlore,3dp3v6,Vaeku,15,Sat Jul 18 23:59:02 2015 UTC,"The Mogu, Mantid and Sha lore was phenomenal. Especially considering that it was all brand new and unfolded like a mystery the first time through the zones. The Garrosh lore was good at points, like the Divine Bell stuff, but as a Garrosh supporter, I ended up hating every single faction leader by the end of MoP."
warcraftlore,3dp3v6,TheSharkFromJaws,8,Sat Jul 18 16:45:42 2015 UTC,"I loved the Mantid lore, and how while we were helping keep Pandaria from being overrun by a corrupted hive-mind, the few mantid we helped basically told us that they would fight us if the Old God returned, and then backed Garrosh.

warcraftlore,3dp3v6,eonge,13,Sun Jul 19 01:18:28 2015 UTC,"It was Wrath of the Lich King, no doubt about it.  Even without considering the storylines in TBC and Vanilla(Which included plenty of Scourge threats), let's go back to Warcraft III.  Sure, at the start each race has it's issues and the world is at stake, but one by one we take care of these threats. The Orcs become free and find a new home, the Night Elves seemingly befriend them and get rid of the Burning Legion Threat, the human kingdoms find new hope on Theramore. Later Illidan's masterplan gets thwarted and Arthas ascends the Frozen Throne.  Okay, everyone happy?  The World of Warcraft starts, and mostly it's some quarrel between the Horde and the Alliance and there's a couple of bad guys like Ragnaros and Onyxia that need to be dealth with, but none of it had much of a base in the lore previously and it's not super scary.  So The Burning Crusade happens, Illidan went even more nuts and is back for some more, sure let's deal with him. We disable the Legion threat and Azeroth is safe right?  Right?   Arthas ascends the Frozen Throne.   Oh. Right, that happened a couple years ago and nobody ever really seemed to care after he decimated the strongest of the human kingdoms, the capital of the High Elves and the ancient Nerubian Empire.  Yeah we're fucked."
warcraftlore,3dpuwb,blozzardpls,14,Sat Jul 18 07:43:19 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll say my pick for each race and then make rankings.    Humans: Khadgar, whilst Varian has a case I think WoD displays once more how powerful Khadgar is.    Dwarves: Difficult one.. I suppose Moira? She's said to be a powerful spellcaster, but it could also be Muradin who is a legendary warrior and a war veteren. So he's got the experience. I'll got with Muradin.    Gnomes: Mekkatorque is the High Tinker for a reason, he's the smartest gnome and for gnomes, Knowledge is power.    Night Elves: Malfurion is the greatest druid alive and whilst Tyrande is a force of her own I do think she's just a bit below Malfurion.  Worgen: Genn Graymane? Or Crowley, I suppose they're pretty equal to each other. Crowley does barehanded cleaves of course.    Draenei: Obviously Velen.    Alright now the Horde side:    Orcs: Thrall, greatest shaman in the world, clear choice. Honourable mention to Varok Saurfang.    Tauren: Difficult one, it could be Hamuul Runetotem, one of the greatest druids ever, Aponi Brightmane, the first Sunwalker or Baine himself who is supposed to be a great Warrior like his dad. I think Hamuul is the stronger then the other two due to his experience.    Troll: Easily Vol'jin, he might perhaps be the Greatest Shadowhunter ever, he's blessed by the Loa, can perform unbelievable acts of Voodoo (changing people into wyvern, mass hexxing opposing alliance raids), expert in hand-to-hand combat due to Monk training and a lethal marksman.    Undead: Clearly Sylvanas, expert marksman like Vol'jin and all the perks of being undead. No need for food, water, air, impossible to tire out.    Blood Elves: Lorthermar? Perhaps Aethas Sunreaver, but probably Lorth.    Goblins: Hmm difficult one! Maybe Rezlak?  Pandaren: Taran Zhu seems like a good choice to me.    Alright rankings!    1: Khadgar 2: Velen 3: Thrall 4: Malfurion 5: Vol'jin 6: Sylvanas 7: Taran Zhu 8: Lorthermar 9: Mekkatorque 10: Hamuul Runetotem 11: Genn Greymane 12: Muradin Bronzebeard 13: Rezlak    To explain my ranking, I view Vol'jin and Sylvanas pretty much as equals and put them in the same tier.    My tiers are:   Tier 1: Khadgar and Velen. Tier 2: Thrall and Malfurion. Tier 3: Vol'jin and Sylvanas Tier 4: Taran Zhu, Lorth, Mekkatorque. Tier 5: Hamuul Runetotem Tier 6: Genn Greymane, Muradin Tier 7: Rezlak."
warcraftlore,3dpuwb,JD1337,3,Sat Jul 18 08:19:11 2015 UTC,"I'd rank Chen as the strongest Pandaren. Let's be honest, Taran Zhu is the pandafication of incompetence."
warcraftlore,3dpuwb,Pinkastrasza,2,Sat Jul 18 17:22:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Chen Stornstout, legendary Pandaren Explorer, would be their pick for champion, in my opinion. Taran Zhu may be a skilled warrior, but he doesn't have the experience that Chen does."
warcraftlore,3dpuwb,SithKain,2,Sat Jul 18 18:19:21 2015 UTC,Totally forgot about Chen! He might very well be more powerful. And yeah TZ is kinda portrayed as a scrub..
warcraftlore,3dpuwb,JD1337,2,Sat Jul 18 22:10:09 2015 UTC,"I mean, he fails to defend the coast, then gets corrupted by the Sha, then allowed the Sha to escape, then gets beaten up by a random Mogu and then gets again beaten up, by Garrosh. Because he got stuck in a bridge with his foot. And he pretty much is responsible for Garrosh's escape due to sparing his life after SoO.  He shows no competence whatsoever that would qualify him as leader of the Shado-Pan."
warcraftlore,3dpuwb,Pinkastrasza,2,Sun Jul 19 00:05:33 2015 UTC,"Great list! Where would you rank Medivh, or even his mother (whose name escapes me at the moment) with Khadgar? And personally I think Alleria Windrunner might be higher than Lor'themar. She's every bit as good as Sylvannas, just without the undead bonus perks."
warcraftlore,3dpuwb,Frolock,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:32:09 2015 UTC,Medivh above khadgar but better then his mom. Dont really know where to place her. Equal to Khadgar I's say.

warcraftlore,3dpuwb,Frolock,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:25:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry. Yes, she is high elf. There is an important difference between them, to the point some high elves may take that as an insult if you call them blood elves. By the way, the question states explicitly the person:   HAS TO BE ALIVE"
warcraftlore,3dpuwb,IllidanS4,2,Sun Jul 19 21:00:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Tyrande is definitely a force to be reckoned with, she is potentially more powerful than Malf, but her powers depend mostly on Elune so that hinders her quite a bit. And I would pick Aethas over Lor'themar easily. Also I'd say Jaina is more powerful than Varian but not as powerful as Khadgar."
warcraftlore,3dpuwb,Vaeku,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:43:43 2015 UTC,Iirc the blessings of Elune kept her both alive and protected from the Burning Legion when she was their prisoner during the war of the ancients - until Vashj lured her out.
warcraftlore,3dpuwb,cattaclysmic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:01:57 2015 UTC,Right but I think in Wolfheart she commented that Elune cannot and will not answer every one of Tyrande's prayers. Sort of like how the shaman have to ask the elements for aid.
warcraftlore,3dpuwb,Vaeku,3,Sun Jul 19 01:40:24 2015 UTC,awesome response !!!! but why is velen tier 1?? (im a wod baby)  and what about tirion?
warcraftlore,3dpuwb,SaurfangtheElder,6,Sat Jul 18 09:09:30 2015 UTC,"I think Tirion's power can be amazing when it's righteousness against an overwhelming darkness like the Lich King is justified, but in any other fight he's just another Paladin with a fancy sword."
warcraftlore,3dpuwb,JD1337,4,Sat Jul 18 10:15:47 2015 UTC,Velen is thousands of years old and probably the strongest light user out there. He was equal to Archimonde and KJ.  Tirion is very powerful but he depends a bit too much on the light choosing to aid him. He'd be dead if not for literally divine intervention.
warcraftlore,3dpuwb,Pinkastrasza,3,Sat Jul 18 22:09:00 2015 UTC,"Velen is the probably most powerful priest we know, plus he is or was on par with Kil'Jaeden and Archimonde. He is also able to purify a severely corrupted Naaru, which speaks for itself.  Personally, I'd place him even above Khadgar. His offensive magic might now be as strong, but that's not the main discipline of a priest after all."
warcraftlore,3dpuwb,WorkplaceWatcher,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:37:54 2015 UTC,"Velen also seemed reasonably certain he could fend off the Iron Horde from taking Karabor by himself (""As long as I stand, Karabor shall not fall!"").

We go in there, we kill some fel orcs, we team up with the Mag'har or the Draeneis and we kill Kael'thas and lady Vashj. Then we proceed to work with Akama, who has betrayed Illidan, to free Maiev, the warden that went out to capture Illidan and bring him to justice. We succeed in doing so and we march on the Black Temple to kill Illidan.  At some point the Amani trolls got angry and decided to attack/raise an army (not sure what their plan was exactly), so naturally we go there, assault Zul'aman and kill  Zul'jin.  However, Kael'thas had survive our assault on the Tempest Keep and he had now taken the Sunwell. He planned to summon Kil'jaeden to our world so that the burning legion could finally destroy Azeroth. We couldn't let that happen so we marched on Isle of Quel'danas, kill the demons and the blood elves loyal to Kael'thas, then proceed to kill Kael'thas again (and for good). In the end we reach sunwell and beat Kil'jaeden back.  The sunwell is cleansed and can now again, be finally used by the blood elves (they didn't have access to it's powers before that)."

warcraftlore,3dq85k,RufinTheFury,2,Sat Jul 18 13:27:03 2015 UTC,"General Kazzak reopens the Dark Portal along with Highlord Kruul. With the looming Burning Legions presence and the ease with which they could amass on the broken continent, we make our way to Outland to both contain this and adventure our way through it. Once we set foot on Outland we start figuring out that the Legion does not hold sway over Outland, but is in a power struggle with Illidan's forces, who by the time we arrive has imprisoned the Legion's general on Outland, Magtheridon. The troops in Honor Hold and Thrallmar try to contain the ever growing number of Illidan's fel orcs by destroying their Source, Magtheridon.  In Zangarmarsh we find out that Lady Vashj is pumping it dry for an unknown reason, further destabilizing whats left of Outlands flora and fauna. The Cenarion Circle/Expedition wants to put a stop to this.   In the Netherstorm we find Kael'thas farming all the magical powers from the ""ley lines"" that were exposed when Draenor imploded. What he wishes to do with it, we do not know, but the Sha'tar and Khadgar seem to agree that its nothing good due to his allegiance with Illidan or maybe even other motives...  Once we make our way through Shadowmoon Valley, we see the complete destruction that fel energy can bring. We find that Illidan is working from inside the highly fortified Black Temple. Because of these fortifications we set our eyes on other problems first.   The first of these being Karazhan. Because of the towers position over the ley lines in Azeroth, it's a place of immense power and it's a weakness for the safety of Azeroth, just as much as the Dark Portal. The powers in the tower can be used to fuel a portal big enough to let the Burning Legion stream into Azeroth. Once we get in the tower and fight our way to the top, we find out that the fears were right. The tower was already being used by a mighty Eredar prince to get into Azeroth, Malchezaar.   Once the problems in Karazhan are taken care of, we set our sights to two constants thorns in both the Alliance and Hordes sides on Outland. The Fel Orcs and the Ogres. The fel horde is being fueled by Magtheridon, so we take him out and the ogres are commanded indirectly by Gruul, so he finds his demise at our hands aswell.   By completing all these feats, we have also managed to get ourselves access to both Serpentshrine Cavern and The Eye of Tempest Keep. These bastions hold the people we can hold accountable for destabilizing Outland even more. Once inside, we are met with extreme opposition, making it clear that they are up to no good. Once both are confronted, we find out that Vashj is working on her own accord but Kael'thas, as found out by the Scryers, turned his back on Illidan and built his Manaforges to aid the Burning Legion.   With confronting these two and taking down their bastions and the help of Illidans third ""loyal"" servant, we find a secret entrance to the Black Temple, bypassing the heavy guard.  Besides this, we also find the Vial's of Eternity that Vashj and Kael'thas held, that can be used as foci to enter the time of the Battle for Mt Hyjal. The timeline here must be preserved and is being threatened by..... literally nothing besides us being there. So let's skip that entirely.  Back to Black Temple! We confront Illidan to stop the threat he is posing to Azeroth by dwaring the Burning Legion ever nearer and the suppression on what left of Outland. We take him down and we stem the tide of the Burning Legion... OR DID WE?  No, it was merely a setback! Kael'thas Sunstrider survived his encounter with us in The Eye and he managed to get back to Azeroth and his own Kingdom. Here, he holed up near the Sunwell, hoping to use the corrupted power to draw the Burning Legion back into Azeroth while we were busy fighting Illidan and diddling about in the timestreams. His own people denounce him and we take him on... but we were too late. The portal was already opened and growing. It was drawing in Kil'Jaeden the Deceiver to take over the Sunwell and eventually Azeroth. We have to stop him but the Sunwell is heavily guarded by those loyal to Kael'Thas and the Burning Legion soldiers already on Azeroth.   We fight our way through and just in the nick of time, we arrive at the Sunwell, only to see Kil'Jaeden emerge from it's depths. The portal wasn't big enough for him entirely though, so there was still time! We fight back and eventually banish him back through the portal, saving the day...   We barely get any time to breathe before the second coming of the Scourge, with Arthas, the Lich King, at it's head...  Hope that clears it up"
warcraftlore,3dq1a1,Peraz,5,Sat Jul 18 09:30:59 2015 UTC,"I like applying Occam's Razor to many discussions on this thread and often like to glance back at developer decisions. I am a big picture guy.   Many events occur in Azeroth without any in-game evidence beforehand. Its a condensed world. Ecosystems are tiny, mob scaling is a gameplay mechanic, mounts magically change size to match the race atop them, etc. Whispering Forest has very little information, and its been around enough years without additional supplimentation - either in the game or from without - that I conclude it was a placeholder that never saw further development.   But magical fairie dragons singing doesn't seem that 'cursed' or something.   Have a gander at the Wowpedia page for them!   http://wow.gamepedia.com/Faerie_dragon  Before checking it myself, I knew only that Faerie Dragons had an affinity for magic. That is sort of the tip of the iceberg. They are involved in the Emerald Dream and nullify/police magic too! Relevant quotes:   The faerie dragons can be truly fearsome as they can do amazing things to magical energy: absorb it, redirect it, even nullify it entirely. They have a powerful natural defense against magic and the unique ability to phase out of reality. Their defense seems to work by the dragon encasing itself within a strong energy shield that repels most magic and conventional attacks. While in this form they can siphon the unused magical energy wasted in basic spell casting, and then focus, amplify, and direct it back at the unfortunate caster in a sort of ""feedback"" attack. This ability is very powerful but requires a great deal of effort, and can only be used sporadically, requiring the dragon to rest between uses. For this reason, the faerie dragons often travel in packs.   It appears in their instinctual duties of policing magic, these hapless dragons wandered into [Dire Maul] in an attempt to disrupt the corrupting energies pulsing through the ruins, but fell prey to the ghostly Highborne and now serve them as pets.    Faerie Dragons police magic. Their out-of-place presence in Tirisfal does not prove anything of course.  But here is an analogy: you see several members of the neighborhood watch complete with match vests and flashlights standing around...nothing.   Why would so many of them be there if there isn't anything significant?  My guess is that The Whispering Forest was a placeholder that was gained realization within the game. There are many such things that are either placeholders or vestigial: Abyssal Maw, PvP Instance Portals, ""To Be Continued"" quests, out-of-date quests, etc.  I also cannot prove this is the case. Perhaps it was put there by bored designers on a lunch break.  But I cannot shake off the Ask Creative Development Q&A post (May 2012):  http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5208785474   Q: Is there truly an Old God underneath the Tirisfal Glade? A: Nope! There’s something incredibly unsettling there, but it’s not an Old God. It isn’t recommended to go digging through the Glades, though.   In most of 4 years since its implementation there has only ever been one acknowledgement from Blizzard and only this short statement due to an inquiry.  And all it comes down to is ""there is something not so good under Tirisfal.""  Additional Speculation:   This may be the landing point of the High Elves, but the area had a negative effect on them so they left. This indicates but does not prove that it was already there. Possible link to Emerald Dream/Nightmare Tirisfal sounds a lot like Tir's Fall. Tir was a Titanic watcher.   So let's condense what we do know:   Faerie Dragons police/nullify magic. They tire out, and come at the area in a group. Nearby creatures approach rather than run away from the event. When the event is done they go back about their days. There is something underground that is unsettling.  That something drove High Elves mad. Faerie Dragons perform a ritual there.   I would expect that in Pandaria were it populated by sufficient Faerie Dragons we would see them near Sha-corrupted areas doing much the same thing.   So until Blizzard elaborates or changes gears literally the only thing we know for certain is that it is not an Old God.  My guess: Its an Old God-related item/creature/presence, but not technically an Old God."
warcraftlore,3dq1a1,DalekRy,3,Sat Jul 18 19:55:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this insightful analysis. It made it even more fun. I, myself, don't think that it might be an Old God artifact or something. There would be no point for Blizzard to deny it so fast and clear. It would be rather strange for them to deny it's an Old God, then hype the place up and then make it a part of an Old God or an artifact. As you say, wouldn't be logical looking into the big picture.  Let's think. Why do the animals of the whispering forest come to listen to the Fairie dragons? If they are absorbing or redirecting bad energy, beasts wouldn't come there, would they? We also know there is something below it, so also probably not an Emerald Dream stuff, even though it's druidy and beasty so it wouls make sense for animals to gather up.  I have no clue to be honest, but it being an artifact or a part of an Old God would be a letdown for me.  Anyways, lets think again: Some people speculate that drawing lines between dead Old God locations and Old God related dungeons form a 5 corner star, with Pandaria making it a 6 cornered star. However, for the stars, people speculate that one of the locations for the star could be Tirisfal Glades. The only thing that doesn't really fit is the Karazhan point, which is just a man made construct and has no Old God related stuff.  In the end, I talked a bunch of stupid stuff and got nowhere. Fuck!"

So I also like the idea that the fairie dragons are drawn to him and the whispering forest is where he is 'buried' or just generally is.   Potentially what drove the High Elves mad (well some of them) when they traveled through it - the whispers of a fallen titan watcher.
warcraftlore,3dq1a1,WrathfulHunteR,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:30:55 2015 UTC,"An old god.  A ""dark magician"" that either cursed the land or had made experiments that left it scarred like that.

There are a lot of individual dwarves that have stood out though. Muradin through Warcraft 3 and a storyline in Storm Peaks, as well as leading the charge for the Alliance in ICC. Fargo Flintlock in the intro to Twilight Highlands. That entire zone is all Dwarf. Sully from Jade Forest and Kun'Lai Summit. Moira got a bit of a spotlight in a scenario, too. And there are the two Dark Irons that help in taking down the dark portal and set up shop in Gorgrond  (in a Garrison campaign one plays out an Ironman parody.)

Mekkatorque leading the charge back in. I would really be ok with something really light hearted or something serious.   I think their is a fair amount of Tauren and Dwarf lore out there.

I feel like cataclysm did it fine with its few dungeons but an entire expansion based on that - disappointing. So many people will be left confused as well, especially new players. The tweet about the twisting nether also fucked everything up.  And enough with the orcs. As if sacking Orgrimmar and killing the orcs there for months wasn't enough. Also the Iron Horde was pretty pathetic. We crushed them on Azeroth and we suffered no drawbacks during our stay on Draenor. All they could do was run and die.  One last thing I didn't like about the expansion is how we are the commander, the leader. Back in WOTLK you competed in the Trial of the Crusade to prove that you are an elite member of the Horde or the Alliance. We were the soldiers, we were the heroes. I don't like how everything is centered around our character.  Overall I hope we won't have anything similar in the future. Never mind alternative Azeroth and everything alternative, orcs - there won't be any orcs left soon. Let's go back to our timeline and have the lore progress there. I believe we have enough unfinished stories and many possible threats left."
warcraftlore,3dohr0,WrathfulHunteR,9,Sat Jul 18 00:23:00 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agreed that I do not like being the main character. It really started to happen in Wrath of the Lich King but I didn't mind it too much because you were still just one of many ""champions"" fighting against the Lich King. Honestly it was kind of cool because NPCs would /salute you and give you random flavor text like ""there goes RufinTheFury! He's an Argent Champion!"" and stuff like that, but at the end of the day you were still just one soldier among many.  Cataclysm kept the trend to an extent, although it got somewhat bad in the Stonetalon Mountains as a Horde member where you eventually became a High Warlord (which is instantly forgotten outside of the zone).  Then came MoP. MoP is where you became the super-hero dude working personally with Varian/Garrosh and becoming a high ranking member of your faction. I wasn't a fan of this at all. WoD has made it even worse by having you be the commander of all the forces on Draenor for your faction. I do not like this one bit. Personally I think the player should be along for the ride, but not the central focus. I'm not saying I want main characters for WoW (see: Thrall) but I do enjoy seeing the storylines of other NPCs leading the charge."

It only makes sense people would be impressed with you."
warcraftlore,3dohr0,electric_eclectic,4,Sat Jul 18 04:32:35 2015 UTC,"Why are you being downvoted? This is a totally valid opinion, and one that's probably vastly more popular outside of this subreddit, apparently. To be the main character? What's unappealing about that?  I thought it was exciting when you first arrive at Valiance Keep as Alliance in WotLK and they say, 'Oh this guy, we know about you. You don't need to wait in line.' Commanding the expedition in Draenor is the only natural choice, considering your military record over four expansions.  EDIT: I remember hearing Metzen talk at one point about the illusion that has to exist as an architecture for the game, as an MMO. I'm paraphrasing a fuzzy memory, but he mentioned as an example that you wouldn't on a given day in SW's Trade District see warlocks on dragons with demon servants flying this way and that around the Auction House. Realistically there are millions of protagonists in the World of Warcraft, but you have to isolate your story and see that you are the hero that matters. Hell yeah you lead the Draenor expedition-- everyone else didn't defeat Hogger, Arthas, Garrosh, etc., you did."

For me, part of the appeal of playing WoW originally was that I got to be just a normal person in a vast world with established heroes. Every single-player RPG out there makes you the protagonist who saves the world. Being a little mage who dealt with very local issues involving food stores and bandits felt unique and immersive for me. I was just an adventurer making a living in that big and dangerous world."
warcraftlore,3dohr0,Azygos,2,Sat Jul 18 12:11:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is true.  Your champion is not the one who survived the fights with EVERY antagonist in the series.  When Onyxia came around several years ago, dozens or hundreds of champions were selected or came to stop her. Most of these died.  In the next instance, let's take the Burning Crusade as an example, many of these same battle hardened champions ventured to Outland to defend their homes, but many, many more fresh recruits and adventurers followed. Few made it back home.  Then we have attacks on the Capitals, several military conflicts on Northrend, between factions, the Cataclysm.  There's not a single super-badass that survived and won all of these fights and is now the Supreme Commander. The people at the frontlines DO NOT survive clash after clash.  The ones that make it through are the Commanders, Varok Saurfang commanding from the top of his gunship, or Malfurion tending to his troops from the rear.  The way we as player characters are portrayed is simply a way for us to experience every part of the conflict, it does not equal us being there (and far from that, surviving) for every sterp of the way."
warcraftlore,3dohr0,SaurfangtheElder,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:24:05 2015 UTC,"Aw, that's a pretty flaccid approach to an epic fantasy adventure, if you ask me. I'm a series of nameless soldiers killed failing to slay a dragon? I choose not to believe that, but of course you're entitled to it.  For the sake of argument, I don't think the fact that we're not Saurfang or Furion or Maiev or Tyrion or whomever means we should feel confined by the role of the player character. It's a video game, after all, not a book or a movie. What's unique to the medium is our involvement in the story, of which contributing a name to a protagonist can be just the beginning. You can't tell me I didn't defeat both Illidan and Deathwing-- I'm Player 1 and I was there. I know how it went down.  See where I'm coming from?

Ofcourse you're free to feel that way about the way you play your character, which was fine in the first versions of World of Warcraft. However, now you're forced into this allmighty character role and I and some others with me dislike that feeling.

Before, say in Wrath, YOU were still able to view yourself as the veteran of Naxxramas, Outland and Northrend, whereas I was still able to feel like a fresh recruit in the unfriendly Grizzly Hills.

As a fellow that likes picking apart the lore from design decisions this has been a lot of fun for me. Which definitely proves the point. I am not a genius. For me to notice a Lore discrepancy someone generally has to point it out. But the moment I saw that tweet I immediately began running through everything I previously knew about demons, dimensions, etc.  I am the Sha of Overthinking. I live for these hiccups. They make for some really fun discussions here on /r/warcraftlore, but they really muddle up the game.   I believe we have enough unfinished stories and many possible threats left.   Oh man. And MoP proved it was not even necessary to explore an old enemy. They built up a whole continent with races and threats to produce most of an expansion. All inspired by three separate things: A Pandaren from WC3, the ever-ready Old God presence, and fanbase distaste of Garrosh.  South Seas/Naga/Zandalar could be tied into a single Expansion or into separate ones.   And of course there are all those little races fumbling about across the world.   Blizzard has proven resourceful at creating content with very little source material. I don't mind hopping planets a little, going to alternate dimensions or even time travel, but I would prefer them to occur separately.  Argus might be fun. A series of dungeons in Outland where we hop through various portals made by Ner'zhul could be neat. A visit to the Emerald Dream could be cool.   An what landmasses might await us with the possibility of further developing unknown lands of Azeroth?"

An alternate universe created for really poorly thought out reasons (Wrathion wants a common enemy for us to unite against - why not Azshara or the remaining Old Gods?) coupled with some terrible lore developments like the Burning Legion and Twisting Nether transcending all timelines/universes. And don't even get me started on Archimonde coming back.  That being said, I think the stories on Draenor itself are really good. The Arakkoa lore was great, the development of Draenei and Orc cultures on Draenor was great, the questing was superb, etc. While the Iron Horde story itself was a complete flub it's all the world-building that was a huge success.  So overall I think it'll be looked at as one of the poorer Lore expansions, like The Burning Crusade, but just like The Burning Crusade, it will also be praised for it's excellent world-building."

Two instances I know of, when Shandris almost dies in Seeds of Faith she cries and when Jaina is dying in War Crimes her voice is trembling during prayer.  Both of these make perfect sense. They're dying and are an adoptive daughter and a very good friend respectively.  Yet she gets all mushy and on the verge of tears just merely thinking about an orc, a race she practically hates and has no love for.

Haven't they both been destroyed? How are they able to be back in time considering they were doing stuff in the other dimensions during Warlords? Why would The Black Prince instigate the alternate timeline, to bring re-inforcements, if the Legion was already defeated by 1 timeline? etc.   It just makes no sense and now Blizzard are too proud to admit they fucked it up"

While this is a futile hope, I hope some of the things that have happened in Warlords of Draenor get retconned.

The gilneans accepting the curse in order to give a middle finger to sylvanas? AWESOME! Them suddenly overcoming their bestial nature because magic (and because the alliance desperately needed a second shapeshifting race)? Fuck this shit sideways. Gilneans should have either perished in their last stand for their homeland (making the threat of the forsaken so much more prominent and poignant) or have driven the forsaken away completely becoming this force of nature to be reckoned with and to be feared.

He was capable of subverting the entire nerubian army, speaking to and instructing kelthuzad, and choosing and corrupting arthas, all from within the frozen throne. It is likely that he witnessed illidans rescue and the following events.   Additionally nerzhul is a servant of kil'jaeden. Kil'jaeden (or at least sargeras) has had dealings with illidan during the first invasion of the burning legion and likely informed nerzhul of the possible ally. When nerzhul stopped taking orders from kiljaeden, kiljaeden recruited illidan to take him out."
warcraftlore,3do6th,alfred725,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:06:37 2015 UTC,"Answering to my ability   1) The area is located in Ashenvale in World of Warcraft. Demon Fall Canyon is where it happened and should still have Mannaroth's Glaive from where he was killed  2) The Legion can't just ""come back"", it takes an enourmas amount of planning / resources to bring them back. The main crux being that the Night Elves were vigilant to stop them as was the Guardian of Tristfall. It was only the events of Warcraft 3 that allowed them to return  3) I assume this was just retconned in World of Warcraft to be Moonglade, there are plenty of zones / maps / levels that don't sync up perfectly with Warcraft 3.   4) What's makes less sense is Illidan saying ""You wreak of death human"" considering he's never met a human before. The answer is that Lich King (Ner'zul is gone at this point) has vague future seeing powers similar to the Emperor in Star Wars. He saw that Illidan taking the Skull of Gul'dan would ensure the Legion lost their power in Azeroth.   5) Honestly the most likely answer is Blizzard just added cool stuff to the cave to make it look cool in Warcraft 3. It's not impossible that stuff would be there, the Lion Horn of Stormwind could have been brought by Jaina's forces and got lost in the cave by an expedition force."

warcraftlore,3dlcp3,alfred725,9,Fri Jul 17 06:07:24 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, Blood Elves/High Elves live just as long as Night Elves. The only difference is their eye color and skin color. There isn't much difference aside from loving Magic/Fel more than Nature. They're just as strong.  Also, Blood Elves weren't cut off from ""Night Elven Magic"" - they were cast out by society. However, Blood Elves (known then as Highborne, or Quel'dorei) took with them that ""Night Elven Magic"" - the Night Elves didn't keep it, nor want it. The Night Elves began nurturing nature and living with Magic. They didn't need Magic for the Priestesses, they had Elune. The Druids didn't need Magic, they called upon the land to do their bidding."
warcraftlore,3dlcp3,tagey,3,Fri Jul 17 10:49:02 2015 UTC,I've heard theories that after Teldrassil was purged of its corruption in the novel 'Stormrage' that the tree was able to fulfill its original purpose and restore the immortality of the Night Elves since it also had the dragons blessings at that time.

They had shrunk in height and their skin had become a peach hue similar to most dwarves and humans.""  Weaker is arguable as they draw from different sources of power. But I stand by what I said as they are not utilizing their natural affinity for nature magic, not worshiping their goddess, don't have access to the energies of the well of eternity and the boons of the dragon aspects, and are physically smaller which would tend towards physically weaker."

While it was destroyed, they rebuilt it - it was used as a summoning mechanism to attempt to bring Kil'jaeden into Azeroth but was stopped. Velen then purified the Sunwell, allowing the Blood Elves to once again use a fount of power.  Also, the Night Elves didn't have an affinity for Nature magic until AFTER the War of the Ancients. As Cenarius didn't take pupils, and that's how the Night Elves began their Druidic presence. He saw something in Malfurion, however. He saw what Illidan could become. And he knew Tyrande would not become a druid. It wasn't until the events of the Sundering, and the events leading up to, that the Night Elven people saw what was happening, what they didn't want to happen again in the future. So they distanced themselves from Magic, and declared it illegal in their own way. It wasn't until Cataclysm that they started to allow Quel'dorei back into Kaldorei society."

Obviously a few wisps wouldn't be able to do too much to Archimonde but the significance is that all the Wisps of the forest came together to sacrifice themselves to form a massive explosion that was powerful enough to destroy Archimonde and banish him back to the Twisting Nether.
warcraftlore,3dlcp3,chipwhitley63,3,Fri Jul 17 08:11:02 2015 UTC,"I've heard the detonate theory and that's pretty good but I've also considered that the wisps ""harvested"" the world tree like they did lumber in the game.

They chose to select a smaller group of elite champions to go in with them.  The entire Argent Tournament is to attract champions to Icecrown, so they can pick the best to join them in the actual assault. This is why they have these trials."
warcraftlore,3djnyi,That_Batman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:40:33 2015 UTC,"I still say a tactical bombing of Icecrown Glacier (and citadel) with the new plague, coordinate by Horde and Alliance alike would've been a much more effective resolution to the Lich King ordeal. The frozen throne sits atop ICC, completely open to attack. Even if it weren't, there's nothing indicating the citadel is airtight (in fact, our very presence inside of it during the raid indicates it is not), and the plague would work its way in regardless.  The lay of the land would have the plague funnel down into the valleys wiping out the scourge therein. All that would be required would be a sealing up of the walls on the glacier's southern side.  As for trust issues after the Wrathgate, I think the Horde (and the Forsaken, namely) offering use of that particular weapon to the Alliance to eliminate a common enemy after going in and putting down the rogue agents would've gone a long way in mending such. The threat of mutually-assured destruction would assure that Horde & Alliance aggression towards each other remains in check (sounds familiar) throughout the operation."

The Argent Dawn formed specifically to protect Azeroth from threats like the Burning Legion and the Scourge. It gained a lot of support and membership in its campaign in the Plaguelands.  As far as why they are leading the charge in Icecrown, I feel like the Death Knight starting quests shed some light on this. I recommend you play through it once, because no paraphrasing would do it justice.  That said, the battle that takes place at the end of this leads to Tirion declaring all out war on Arthas.   On this day, I call for a union! The Argent Dawn and the Order of the Silver Hand will come together as one! We will succeed where so many before us have failed!

The Horde and the Alliance are distracted by all their shitty history together. It only makes sense for them to let the guys literally formed for THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM to take the reins.

How old was King Terenas when Arthas kills him? Its mentioned that Terenas ruled over Lordaeron for 70 years... so how old did he live to be? THe wiki doesn't say, so we can guess in his late 80s. Does the Legion still control any part of the Scourge/Undead? The meeting of Dreadlords on their home planet shows abominations being present.

I believe that NerZul finally broke free of the Legion's control once he melded with Arthas, so any scourge creatures would probably not remain loyal to the Legion. When Arthas assaults Quel'Thalas, Nerubians arrive to help him. How did those Nerubians get there? I just cant imagine them sailing... perhaps an under ground tunnel network connected to Northrend? If so then I wonder if thats whats under Tirisfal Glades, maybe acting as a prison or holding some dark secret? (I am a fan of Tirisfal being - Tyr has fallen, but if there are tunnels from Nerubians then maybe its all 'connected'). I think you're right about the Nerubians having extensive tunnels, but I doubt they have any that span the length of the north sea - but I could be wrong. This may just be another convenience by the story telling."
warcraftlore,3di1j2,CSNX,9,Thu Jul 16 13:34:32 2015 UTC,"I think some of these questions could have been dug into a bit more carefully:   How does Muradin know about Frostmourne?   From Wowpedia: Muradin was also one of the founding members of the dwarven Explorers' League, which was dedicated to exploration and archaeology across the world. In his travels, Muradin visited Northrend and became fascinated with the desolate continent. He returned to it often, observing its ferocious natives and sketching its ruined architecture. It was during one expedition to Northrend in search of the runeblade Frostmourne that Muradin met Arthas for the final time.   Who or what is the guardian that guards the cave with Frostmourne in it?    While as you point out this is not entirely known, there is some speculation that these Elemental Guardians are affiliated with Yogg-Saron.   Why was Kel'Thuzad buried in Andorhal, in fact why was he buried at all in a noteable grave?   It seems very unlikely that he was buried by members of the Kirin Tor, which also has no affiliation with the city of Andorhal. Instead, the most likely explanation is that because this is the same place where he was killed by Arthas that some of his followers survived the battle or returned afterwards to bury him close to where he fell.   How old was King Terenas when Arthas kills him?   Wowpedia mentions King Terenas ruled for 50 years, not 70. This would make more sense, as Arthas is still relatively young when he murders King Terenas. a ~20 year old son murdering his 80+ year old father seems unlikely. This would put his age at between 60 and 80 years, where I believe the younger values to be much more likely considering he fathered two children that have not yet surpassed their mid-twenties.   Does the Legion still control any part of the Scourge/Undead?   Not after the events in Warcraft III: TFT, no. I don't believe we are witness to the Dreadlords meeting on their home planet (Of which very little is known in general).   When Arthas assaults Quel'Thalas, Nerubians arrive to help him. How did those Nerubians get there?    Make no mistakes about the size of the Nerubian (or Qiraji for that matter) kingdoms, it is entirely possibles that there are tunnels leading to outposts under even the Eastern Kingdoms. Quel'Thalas is relatively close to Northrend and it could be. However I do agree, it's also quite likely that this is simply a convenience in storytelling to introduce these units at that particular time."

warcraftlore,3di1j2,CSNX,2,Thu Jul 16 16:20:53 2015 UTC,The guard of Frostmourne is a actually Revenant. The specific revenant is called The Guardian.
warcraftlore,3di1j2,Tovxc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:42:11 2015 UTC,"Makes sense not to move the remains of Kel'Thuzad, given their state after his death... Muradin probably learned of Frostmourne's position from Ner'zhul's agents. This was all part of his (Ner'zhul's) master plan."
warcraftlore,3di1j2,IllidanS4,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:46:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting that Wowpedia mentions Terenas ruling for 50 years and not 70. I think I thought of that question from when Arthas kills Uther, just before the fight Uther says ""your father ruled these lands for 70 years"" (or something to that affect). Potential retcon?"
warcraftlore,3di1j2,SaurfangtheElder,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:53:23 2015 UTC,"Actually yeah, turns out you're right.  Apparently it was retconned in Arthas: Rise of the Lich King, according to Wowpedia:   In Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, Uther tells Arthas that Terenas ruled Lordaeron for seventy years. In Arthas: Rise of the Lich King, this was changed to fifty years."
warcraftlore,3di1j2,Elcactus,3,Fri Jul 17 19:11:38 2015 UTC,"On 5 and 6:  To flesh out 5 a bit more, the Scourge that went to Kalimdor for the assault on Hyjal were mostly annihilated, though some stragglers may have remained and made their way to razorfen.  Since no Legion agents capable of controling the scourge survived the assault, they would be under NZ, and later Arthas.  The scourge remaining in Lordaeron was under the dreadlords, and their defeat signified the deaths of the last legion agents still embedded in the scourge.  For 6, the Necropoli from Northrend, including Naxrammas, had already moved to Lordaeron (as seen in the KT short story) by the time of WC3).  Presumably they would have carried many nerubians with them."

warcraftlore,3di1j2,barechips,2,Thu Jul 16 14:45:55 2015 UTC,These are some good questions actually. And I'm loving the responses!
warcraftlore,3dgfm7,fruitymasta,11,Thu Jul 16 01:56:38 2015 UTC,"One of the big theories that I've seen is that the Iron Horde Remnant, Frostwolf, and AU Draenei are the foundation of the Army of Light. Wrathion was disappointed that Varian didn't destroy or absorb the Horde after the siege of Orgrimmar. He wanted a unified Azeroth ready to stand against the Legion. When he learned of what Kairoz could do with the Vision of Time, he saw a way to get the armies of another world instead.  The AU Draenei represent their race at its pinnacle, and their armies are veterans of the battles against the Iron Horde and the Shadow Council/Sargerei/Legion forces. Despite losing Velen, they are led by four strong exarchs. The Iron Horde Remnant is led by Grom Hellscream, the slayer of Mannoroth, and still possesses modern siege technology. The Draenor clans as a whole still have retained their connection to Draenor's elements.   But, there's one more thing. Draenor's armies aren't at war with each other, like the Alliance and Horde. They really only hate the Burning Legion. When the Legion finds Azeroth, the might of two worlds can confront them.  I don't think Wrathion expected the Draenor situation to escalate to the point of Archimonde, but, knowing the situation that already existed on Draenor, he expected an invasion."
warcraftlore,3dgfm7,TNR_Gielnorian,4,Thu Jul 16 02:29:54 2015 UTC,"What I find stupid is that the Legion's only claim is their size. They're ranks aren't a threat at all. We just took care of Archimonde, the General and commander of the Legion's entire army. Aside from some hanky panky plot writing, we should realistically be able to handle these threats. It's not like Hellfire Citadel wasn't filled with some insanely powerful Legion members, Xhul'Horoc, Fel Lord Zakuum, A pit lord.... Aside from a number battle, what is there to fear beyond Sargeras himself?   If it does get to Sargeras level, then Blizzard has to consider how to top that."
warcraftlore,3dgfm7,Tezzeret,17,Thu Jul 16 05:45:33 2015 UTC,"That's the huge disconnect between the established lore (even from the game) and the actual gameplay mechanics.      When infernals are raining from the sky, livestock and farmland starts oozing fel ooze, anyone of any importance starts getting seduced by succubi and/or corrupted and bribed.       In theory established by lore, when burning legion invasion happens the whole world burns and cracks, there's no food, no clean water, everything is corrupted to the point where anyone who isn't very protected either dies or becomes corrupted. Social structures break down long before that happens however with population become like the Sargerei - tools of the legion.    That's why burning legion invasion is such a big deal - it's not just some dragon you kill and go home, it's not like some undead that you can block off with a cool wall and some siege weapons. Cataclysm caused by deathwing comes close to it actually - the whole idea of a burning legion invasion is that it's a global catastrophy that just keeps getting worse and worse.     It's cool that the ""heroes"" can get by without food, water, clean air, farmland, houses, cities, guards and so on ...but Azeroth as a whole can't."

warcraftlore,3dgfm7,ZulZorandor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:13:45 2015 UTC,"Aside from a number battle,   That is the problem. The legion has an uncountable number of demons in its ranks. It does not matter if your warriors worth 10 demons because the legion has hundred, a thousand demons per warrior. If your civilization has any reliance on magic then you are screwed because they have demons that feed on magic. There is no wall thick enough, no hole deep enough that you can can hide from the legion. You are not safe even amongst your own kind as there are those who will serve the legion either in life, or in death.  The legion is infinite. The legion is eternal. There is no stopping them."
warcraftlore,3dgfm7,Deputy_McDuff,2,Sun Jul 19 09:35:27 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. You have Draenei and MU Velen and Anduin to pull the alliance in and you have Grom/Thrall. I throw Thrall in there just due to the fact the Horde is now Vol'jin's Horde. While he understand the importance of Grommash and his MU historyn but at the end of the day...he is still a Troll.  So Grommash coming back will rally the Orcish Horde while Thrall being the green Jesus he is, is going to get Vol'jin on board. Which is super easy since they best Bros for life.   But honestly I would really like to see more hiccups a long the way. Just for the sake of story telling. Horde still needs to sort out their issues with Sylvanas cause at this point I doubt her and the Forsaken would assist. Expecially if Blizzard makes the Army of Light come across as a last resort/suicide mission.  As for the Alliance I think it will be pretty straight forward. But think it would be interesting to see if Blizzard does push the story with Sylvanas you could potentially see Human political struggles could slow things as they slowly reclaim their territories.  All in all, I agree with you but would like it to be VERY early stages of everything. I think MU Azeroth still has loads of potential story before the big group hug of Light begins."
warcraftlore,3dgfm7,juel1979,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:36:25 2015 UTC,"If an Army of the Light situation arises, I wonder how many Forsaken would be interested. If offered, would any jump back at the chance to be somewhat redeemed? With Sylvanas' nightmare visions during her suicide convince her? She's pretty selfish. If you say that won't happen, regardless of you having 1ups, I believe she'd definitely consider it, if not leap at the chance."
warcraftlore,3dgfm7,Deputy_McDuff,2,Fri Jul 17 01:04:14 2015 UTC,Yea you can honestly write it either way. She jumps at the chance to help yo save herself or she doesn't join in to save herself. Just kind of up to what they decide plays out best.   But regardless it will be a huge pivot point for her character either way.
warcraftlore,3dgfm7,juel1979,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:21:07 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping if this happens, it goes redemption route. Otherwise, don't the Forsaken end up on the outs with everyone?"
warcraftlore,3dgfm7,Deputy_McDuff,2,Fri Jul 17 17:33:41 2015 UTC,"I mean, if Blizzard wants to keep the factions as is then yes.   But honestly, I played WoW for a long time. But I do think the MMO side of things is really starting to hold the story back. I would love to see a new Warcraft game or a huge expansion into like WoW 2.0 and include a huge amount of story between the two to really shake things up.   That way you could have the Foresaken detach from the Horde, and still have a redemption story for Sylvanas (or not). Just simple mechanics such as Undead being a playable race really tethers down this story in my personal opinion."
warcraftlore,3dgfm7,juel1979,2,Fri Jul 17 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"I could see a few ways it could go and Forsaken remain playable (without some deus ex machina making them all revert somehow, which seems impossible, but yanno, fantasy). It would just be weird for them to take a route that knocks a whole race out. All of my classes that can be Forsaken (minus hunter because story) are Forsaken, so I would be up a creek. Heh"
warcraftlore,3dgfm7,Elcactus,5,Fri Jul 17 19:19:23 2015 UTC,"Presumably he wanted to gain an ""infinite army"" like Kairoz described.

warcraftlore,3dgfm7,MisunderstoodPenguin,3,Thu Jul 16 02:28:11 2015 UTC,"It's so weird that a dragon from not the bronze flight first put the motion of the infinite dragonflight in the game. Maybe nozdormus fate won't be what he has seen, maybe it'll be wrathion."

warcraftlore,3dgfm7,Firebat12,2,Thu Jul 16 08:32:31 2015 UTC,"But that contradicts why Wrathion would even allow this alternate reality to even be connected to us, the legion could not have ""gotten bigger"" if we never got in touch with AU Draenor anyways to affect us!"

Now, without the Horde, this means that ALL human kingdoms are still intact. Eastern Kingdoms is more prosperous than ever. No undead scourge either since Ner'zhul wasn't made in to the Lich King. The Night Elves, with the aid of the Taurens, dragons, maybe the ancients, Cenarius, would probably defeat C'thun still.  Azeroth would be destroyed, but it also couldn't. Many things are different on alternative Azeroth, for better or worse. Some things would be harder to deal with and some easier, we can't say for sure."
warcraftlore,3dfzux,WrathfulHunteR,4,Thu Jul 16 00:50:28 2015 UTC,"There would be no Nether Drakes either, so Deathwing's family's experiments can only go as far as Chromatic. At least they might need a different tactic to destabilize the Human Kingdoms.  But also Deathwing won't be made vulnerable by Khadgar at Blade's Edge and (sort of) defeated by the Kirin Tor on his way back from Draenor. Rhonin also wouldn't be able to destroy the Demon Soul, so the other Dragonflights would still be without power.  Deathwing was able to make a play on A LOT of stuff during and after the 2nd war."
warcraftlore,3dfzux,sorin255,2,Thu Jul 16 03:42:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the world may even be less warring, unless it turned into a Kalimdor vs EK warring state of existence (High Elves may still be antagonistic to the Night Elves, and vice-versa).   Ooh, maybe even a rescue mission for Illidan for him to rejoin the High Elves."
warcraftlore,3dfzux,draekia,3,Thu Jul 16 02:23:48 2015 UTC,"That's not necessarily a good thing, since the Old God all still exist. The Horde v Alliance conflict was given the parallel in Pandaria of the Mantid v the Pandaren / Mogu. The Mantid would send everything they had, only the best would survive, and with every cycle they would grow stronger. The reason the Alliance is as powerful as they are is because they have constantly been pushed by the Horde and, as a result are constantly having to grow and improve and refine.  Who knows how many technologies in WoW were created simply for war, and how many affordances they no long have as a result of not being constantly fighting something.  Edit: Also just because the orcs aren't there, doesn't mean Medivh/Sargeras aren't. The Legion on Draenor seems VERY determined to invade Azeroth, but we have no idea which Azeroth."
warcraftlore,3dfzux,sgtrama,2,Thu Jul 16 14:07:10 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear, we have no reason to believe that there are AU old gods or Titans, correct?"

The reason we can time travel at all is because the Titans gave the bronze dragonflight that power. It's assumable that time travel to the Titans, as it is for the Legion, is something that's just inherit. Titans exist outside of time as we know it."
warcraftlore,3dfzux,sgtrama,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:47:39 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, Broxigar, Krasus, and Rhonin were sent back in time accidentally due to the Old Gods meddling with time. The first time around, the Night Elves won the war, but that was without the influence of the Old Gods. With the Old Gods intending to sabotage the war, the outcome was uncertain, and without Broxigar, Krasus, and Rhonin it may not have been a victory. I feel like the Old Gods are overlooked in this scenario."
warcraftlore,3dfzux,wefwegfweg,6,Sat Jul 18 21:46:34 2015 UTC,The War of the Ancients happened once without Brox. Their being sent back in time forced them to make sure the same outcome happened just in case their being there changed anything. That's my interpretation and I believe in game sources confirm that.
warcraftlore,3dfzux,tomtim90,2,Wed Jul 15 23:57:42 2015 UTC,"I think it's one single timeline though in these cases, so it'd have to be a repeating circle of Rhonin+Krasus+Brox going back in time to help because it'd be a paradox. Besides, how would the Night Elves have been able to gain the help of the dragons without Krasus? How would they have been able to fly to where Deathwing kept the Demon Soul without Krasus (in the sense that the future elf form worked with the past dragon form)?  And I also think it would be like the early CoT instances where you're going back in time to fix something the Infinite Dragonflight was screwing with and afterwards the Bronze Dragonflight wipes the memory of those in the past. From the Night Elves' perspective, they may have thought they originally fought in the War of the Ancients without the trio from the future, but this very well could have simply been because their memory of those characters were erased after the war ended and the timeline was fixed."

Sure, there isn't a Horde to help out with post WC2 problems, but humanity is also much stronger since the Horde never killed a bunch of them, and the same goes for the Night Elves, though not as much. Plus, Archimonde, Mannoroth, and a bunch more important demons are already dead. It's unlikely AU Azeroth is currently destroyed (They are still in the first war time-wise), as even if KJ finds a replacement for Ner'zul as the Lich King, the plague won't hit for another decade at least, and all the WoW era stuff is even farther off for them. However, there's no telling if they will be capable of dealing with them or not with their situation."
warcraftlore,3dfzux,LeonusStarwalker,2,Thu Jul 16 01:30:11 2015 UTC,"The alternate Draenor we are on exists within its own little pocket universe (linked to the MU via the Dark Portal) which nothing else in it. This is the exact point that the devs have been trying, but failing, to drive into the playerbase's skulls since BlizzCon 2013. AU Azeroth effectively doesn't exist.  Or, if you want to risk your sanity, think of it this way: When Kairoz and Garrosh changed the timeline, they basically caused the AU to split in two. The Draenor we visit has split off into its own pocket dimension with the Iron Horde forming, but the AU's ""main"" timeline - where no one was there to tell Grommash ""Oh hey, Gul'dan's green stuff? Not a good idea"" - proceeds as normal and an AU Old Horde invades AU Azeroth."
