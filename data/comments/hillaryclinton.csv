Hillary's youngest woman president line got a standing ovation with thunderous applause with chants of Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! The GOP needs to stop blaming and shaming women for making their own decisions about their health. The Republicans say... I'm not a scientist. Then why don't you start listening to scientists? Across the board, they (the GOP) are the party of the past, not the future. Hillary took a jab at Trump for his divisive rhetoric  ...instead of trying to turn back the clock, they (the Republicans) should be joining us in saying no, no to discrimination once and for all... America is a gift but it's a gift that must be earned by every generation... Today confirms that the equality we've been fighting for has been in our Constitution all along. Quotes from Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion ""No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right."" And to that I say AMEN! Thank You! It was an emotional roller coaster of a day. This morning, love triumphed in the highest court in our land. Equality triumphed, America triumphed. Today is a very historic day...Every one of us is equal...   7:30 pm CT - Hillary Clinton is now on stage."

Generations of advocates and activists sacrificed so much for this victory.  This is our country at its best: inclusive, open, and striving towards true equality.  But the struggle for LGBT rights doesn’t end with this triumph. Our work is not finished until every American can not only marry, but live, work, pray, learn, and raise a family free from discrimination and prejudice.  Hillary"
