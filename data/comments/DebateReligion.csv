Sola fida is only really found in certain segments of protestantism.   Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky would highly disagree, as would many traditions.

Do you think it is useful for people to have a working definition of what the core, essential properties of a doctrine is? If so, is this simply faith without question?  My answers would be yes, and then no, respectively. Christianity does not expect you to simply take the Nicene Creed as it is, unquestioningly. That's churches and theologians have spent so much time expounding upon various doctrines and dogmas. However, ti is unfair for us to call the dividing line between Christianity and ""not-Christianity"" something akin to unquestioning faith.

Anglicanism, for instance, is to all intents and purposes entirely benign (I use these examples because American Protestantism is essentially non-existent here). Of course there are arguments in both which are deeply flawed, but it's just as bizarre to complain about the Church of England because you don't like the Pope.

Most schools believe that you should, for instance, put your full faith behind your teacher and never deviate from her instructions...after you've determined her merits as a teacher that is.  You also have to have faith to begin the practices because their effectiveness really only reveals itself after some time. Why do I practice?

There are also many teaching, especially in the Vajrayana which indicate that a student without faith is not a suitable vessel for the special tantric teachings and methods.

It's like you have faith in the Buddha that he was a good enough teacher to at least try his teachings. Same with your personal teacher. I think of it like this: doctor tells me that drinking pop is bad for migraines. He says to try water only for a few months. I have faith that this person is called a doctor for a reason so I give it a try. In that same vein I have faith that Siddhartha was called Buddha for a reason so I try it.  Now this is similar to putting faith in Jesus, Moses, Muhammad or Baha'u'llah but it not similar to putting faith in God. If I have cancer or something and I talk to my pastor about it and he says have faith in God you will recover. It is not the same thing. This is what is meant by this."
DebateReligion,3e3xb7,SsurebreC,2,Tue Jul 21 21:01:26 2015 UTC,"Good point. Have faith in the teacher, not in what is taught. Try the teachings out on your own and go from there. And even then, the nature of the faith is different because you keep or discard the practice based on evidence gained by experience.

DebateReligion,3e3xb7,Proverbs313,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:08:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I feel like Buddhism and Abrahamic religions both use the word faith to describe two completely different concepts. I mean the idea of faith for an Abrahamic religion does make sense given that their God is all knowing. The fact of the matter though is that it most often does not matter. One of the things the Buddha never really touched on was the idea of a creator god or an all powerful god and the reason I think is that whether or not he exists is irrelevant. If he doesn't exist then we are on our own and have to fix our own dukkha, if he does exist then we sure as heck aren't see his help! Or maybe it is him but in either case it is being fixed.  Nevertheless I don't care what religion or no religion someone follows as long as it doesn't hurt people. Even then religions with violence to them can still have some good to them if they are practiced properly in my opinion. If you have to dislike anything then hate the action (murder, theft etc) and not the person committing the action (murderer, thief) because the moment you equate that action with the person you are clinging to some idea and don't let it change.   I'm Canadian so we don't have death row but I was watching some of those NatGeo shows on death penalty in the USA and I can almost guarantee you that after 20 years in prison plus death row that a majority of violent murderers have changed. This doesn't mean you have to release them all but everyone changes."

'Believe this because I tell you to', isn't helpful when determining an objective truth. 'Believe this because I tell you to, even though there is evidence to the contrary', is beyond unhelpful, and actively damaging when looking for 'truth'.   How do you reconcile that your reliance on faith leaves you ignorant to truths that are provable to all doubters?   I'm not sure you can. I think you'd be forced to choose one or the other, assuming you don't simply choose not to think about it. As far as I can see, the way most people overcome this issue is to simply abstain from thinking about it. Once you start to think about it, you'll eventually find yourself at an impasse, where you will have to decide whether you side with evidence or faith.  edit: I should disclaim, this is not something I've had to work through personally, so this is the opinion of someone looking in from the outside, as opposed to from within looking out."

Odd, because the Buddha only became the Buddha because he sat under a tree, climbed the 8 levels of enlightenment, and reached nirvana.  It's an independent source with no witnesses.  Seems like I would have to take the main theological tenet of Buddhism on faith just for that fact, the fact that puts the ball in motion for Buddhist philosophy's end goal.  As for the main question about which method is best for finding truth, the Buddhist one is, for sure, but it's not unique to Buddhism.  Judaism is big on asking question.  Many here have stated that Christianity also has a lot of room for asking questions.

This stuff isn't to just be accepted. Come and see for yourself.      When Buddha was adressing the Kalamas, a group of people who were confused at the proliferation of religious ideas, and what their validity was, Buddha told them this:     Of course you are uncertain, Kalamas. Of course you are in doubt. When there are reasons for doubt, uncertainty is born. So in this case, Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are unskillful; these qualities are blameworthy; these qualities are criticized by the wise; these qualities, when adopted & carried out, lead to harm & to suffering' — then you should abandon them.  ...   ""Now, Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are skillful; these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the wise; these qualities, when adopted & carried out, lead to welfare & to happiness' — then you should enter & remain in them.   He then goes on to make a very logical case for a practice based on the intention of leaving behind greed, ill will, and aversion, and taking up a practice of good will and virtue, as being clearly something that is ""beneficial, praised by the wise, and when adopted and carried out leads to the reduction of suffering.   Buddhism can be quite logical. Although I would agree, you do find some faith-based stuff. But, according to the teachings, that can be seen as secondary to the practice being a means of alleviation of suffering.    ""All I teach is suffering, and the end of suffering.""      ""Abundantly perform beneficial acts. Cease doing all harmful acts. Completely purify your mind. This is the teaching of the Buddha."""

This seems like something from either a later school or a Facebook quote. There are actually various passages in the Pāli canon dealing with faith, but not faith in the blind sense.    They recommend having faith in the Buddha's teachings because it is helpful in proceeding along the path of his teachings, and we also have faith because we've seen that his teachings have worked for others.    If the Buddha truly said to take nothing on faith, it seems like his various, literal teachings of Kamma, rebirth, and different realms of existence would go right out the window, as these are things we cannot fully experience first hand in this one life."

If he told them everything they knew was a lie, they wouldn't have followed him.  Just like Jesus.  He had to affirm the old laws otherwise he would himself have been rejected.  Faith is the seed, practice the rain, And wisdom is my yoke and plough. Modesty's the pole, mind the strap, Mindfulness my ploughshare and goad.  I was referring to blind faith that Christianity requires.  Buddhism's faith requirements are very small and I wouldn't call them faith.  If you saw two physical education teachers that you had to pick from, and one was healthy and fit, the other fat and sick, would that require faith to pick the one that was obviously best?  No, of course not.  Picking Buddha is similar.  90% of Buddhist monks of every tradition are much more fit then teachers of other religions.    You've chosen to follow a different form of Buddhism that requires faith.  I can't do that.  I demand proof.

Given the number of instances in which the Buddha taught of Kamma, rebirth, etc. literally, plus the number if times he directly challenged the beliefs of people talking with him, I don't see why he wouldn't tell about the falsity of these concepts. This is in addition to his teachings that a worldview without Kamma and rebirth is wrong view.    If he told them everything they knew was a lie, they wouldn't have followed him. If the Buddha taught of these things literally when he knew that they weren't true, that would mean that he lied.     I have experienced bliss, insight, compassion beyond my abilities at points when I have reached certain levels that have proven to me that Buddhism teaches what I want to know without all the metaphysical baggage.     The view of these concepts as metaphysical baggage is a fairly new one. Without the concept of rebirth, the teachings fall apart. The Buddha taught that life is inherently suffering and dissatisfaction. The purpose of the teachings is to escape this life by liberating ourselves from samsara. If you accept annihilationism, which the Buddha rejected, then the quickest way to liberation would be killing yourself.    There's nothing wrong with using the teachings to increase your happiness in this present life, but saying that the Buddha taught that this life is all we have is wrong view."

To try to infer it by some other kind of inference, would just push the question to how we know that other kind of inference to be valid. And so on.

You can interpret the story any way you want if you're going to call the book an inaccurate historical record.  You could say they accidentally did some kind of magic that didn't require a foreign god.  You could say the israelites were just getting tired, and were not really mentally invested in this war of conquest anymore.  Obviously this approach has problems for a biblical literalist.    But as long as you're going to say the original authors were naive children describing things they didn't understand, I don't see why you'd want to cling to magic.  Just say the primitive moabites got a huge psychological boost from believing their god was giving them furious strength, and there was no god and no magic power?  And that the same thing was going on for the jews.  Which would explain the time the full might and majesty of yaweh's power was unable to defeat some guys who had armored chariots.

Modern measurements place this moment at approximately 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe.[7] After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity to form stars and galaxies.   While it's entirely possible that the universe began with the Big Bang, it's also possible that the conditions ""prior"" to the initial expansion existed eternally.

If jesus had the ability to make the fig tree miraculously put forth fruit, it would be irrelevant, since he wanted to kill the tree for the sake of a metaphor.  Now, is the metaphorical lesson he was trying to teach a good one?  I don't think it was, so don't ask me to defend the story.

It also is a dick move for all of the other travellers that can no longer get figs from the plant.  Which still leaves less figs for everyone.  I would consider that a negative where as I will have a fig surplus which means more figs for everyone.    The metaphor could have easily been taught in a more positive way by making figs appear on the figless tree.  I wish the Lorax appeared after he cursed the tree and gave Jesus a stern talking to.  The Fig tree is a buetiful and bountiful tree that can be passed down from generation to generation it has delicious fruit.  To destroy that and leave people with no fig tree is a net negative, and to use it to prove a point just makes the man a bigger jerk.    I gave the gift of life and fruit, Jesus gave the gift of death, destruction, no future fruit and a point about believing stuff for gaining magical powers.  Redsteakraw's intelligence compassion and work ethic allows for a very tangible benefit where as Jesus's was petty and left the location worse than he found it."

DebateReligion,3e3eny,Akatriplekill,2,Tue Jul 21 18:45:15 2015 UTC,"First Point - trying to understand free will and Allah's knowledge.  Allah knows the beginning and the end at the same time and all that is in the middle, comprehensively with the most intimate knowledge about things, the creator knows everything that has happened at every place within existence and everything about it since time itself was incepted, he also knows everything that is presently happening even what you and i are feeling, he also knows everything that will ever happen. Also he knows something else - he knows what would not happen but if it where to happen he knows how it would happen, i.e if you where given 3 choices, he knows which one you will choose and also which one you will not choose but also if you where to choose B or C what the outcome will be. Therefore everything has already been written. But he did not make that choice for me, you or anyone else, he knew every choose you would be given in life and how you would make that choice and how that would determine your life and how you ended it, that is ultimate knowledge, it does not take away from your freedom of choice it’s just the fact that Allah already knew.  So imagine it this way the Creator knows everything that will happen and has the power to change anything, the Creator however allows all that he knows will happen to happen, thus we may use the phase ""let free will take its course"".    Second Point - Ordained group XYZ to action Y that leads to destination X.  If you are asking do all christians and jews go to hell, the answer i've come to find is no, if your asking does or did the Creator already know who will and will not end up in hell from among the two mentioned groups or any group in general - then the answer is ""the Creator knows everything and nothing escapes his knowledge"" as per the first point(that the creator is all-knowing). It however still does not take away from mankind's freedom of choice(aka free-will) it’s just the fact that the Creator already knew as highlighted in the first point.   My answer: The Quran actually supports the idea that Allah leads people astray in 14:4 I consider a God that purposefully leads people to hellfire to be evil.   On that point ""purposefully"", what do you mean by that? i.e I can say i purposely hit person A, and i can also say i purposely hit person A because person A hit me. the first one makes it look like there was no reason/wisdom behind my action, that it was just as is, the second one makes it clear the action was done due to an opposite action from the receiving partly (action = reaction) i.e the action is not absent a purpose(to respond) and reason(because of the opposite parties action). Thus by that construction if i apply a force to a rock with my hand the rock will apply an equal force back to my hand this is action = reaction, can i say the Rock is evil because of the equal reaction it had to my applied force or that i am evil in applying an equal force back to a force applied to me - i.e someone hits me with force X, i return it to them force X. Am i considered evil. Take not that an equivalent balanced exchange has occurred. So unless we are aware of the purpose and reason behind the Creators action we cannot call it evil."

DebateReligion,3e3qwd,moxin84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"Well  obviously  many  people  who  are  brought  up in strict  religious  households  do  abandon  those  religions,  and  obviously  many  other people  don't,  and  whether they  do  or don't  depends  on  their  specific  life  experiences.  Taking  2  minutes  to  actually  check  some  sources  here  (unlike a few  other  people who have  commented)  -  Richard Dawkins:   Dawkins describes his childhood as ""a normal Anglican upbringing"".[20] He was a Christian until halfway through his teenage years, at which point he concluded that the theory of evolution was a better explanation for life's complexity, and ceased believing in a god.[16]   Dawkins states: ""the main residual reason why I was religious was from being so impressed with the complexity of life and feeling that it had to have a designer, and I think it was when I realised that Darwinism was a far superior explanation that pulled the rug out from under the argument of design. And that left me with nothing.""[16]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins#Background  (Sources given   in the  Wikipedia article)  -  Christopher Hitchens:    Hitchens was raised nominally Christian, and went to Christian boarding schools but from an early age declined to participate in communal prayers. Later in life, Hitchens discovered that he was of Jewish descent on his mother's side.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens  (Sources   in the  article.)  So,  like many  people,  both  Dawkins and  Hitchens  were  religious  ""lite""  in childhood, and  later abandoned  religion.  My  sense  is that Dawkins'  loss of  faith was  primarily  due  to  rationality -  when  he  learned the  details  of  how  science  works,  he  discoverd that  religion is a mix  of  things that haven't  been  shown to be true  and things that  have been shown  to be  not  true  -   while    Hitchens   seems  to  have  been  motivated  more  by moral concerns  -  the realization that  the  Abrahamic  faiths  have  inspired a  great deal  of  extremely  immoral  behavior and  continue  to  to  do  so.  But  I'm  not  an  expert  on either of these two  guys  -  I'm just taking my best guess there.       tl;dr:   If Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens were born in Amish or Haredi Jewish families do you think they would have left the sect/religion    IMHO   that  would  depend  on their  specific  life  experiences,  which  would  be  entirely  hypothetical  (since neither of them  was  in fact raised  in an Amish, Haredi,  or  other  ""strict"" religion.)"

In most cases, there are a series of steps or gradations between one event and the one in question and no reason is given as to why the intervening steps or gradations will simply be bypassed. This ""argument"" has the following form:   Event X has occurred (or will or might occur). Therefore event Y will inevitably happen.    This sort of ""reasoning"" is fallacious because there is no reason to believe that one event must inevitably follow from another without an argument for such a claim. This is especially clear in cases in which there is a significant number of steps or gradations between one event and another."
DebateReligion,3e4g5e,spaceghoti,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:15:59 2015 UTC,"It's only a fallacy when an event is said to be inevitable or something that necessarily follows a preceding event.  For example, many conservatives were saying that making same-sex marriage legal will lead to the criminalization of Christianity and the right to marry children or animals.  That's a fallacy, because there has been no demonstration that this is the case.  It's a fallacy if there's no demonstration, because if you can demonstrate that something will lead to something else that's just causation.  An example of this is a set of dominoes, meaning if I push over the first one that will lead to the next one falling over, which will then hit the next one, and so on.  There's a demonstration that one thing inevitably leads to another, which isn't fallacious."
DebateReligion,3e4g5e,EdwardHarley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:01:17 2015 UTC,"A relevant point is that often a slippery slope argument has lots of steps, so it goes more like: if we do A then we'll do B, then C etc. so we'll inevitably do Z which is bad. But each link won't be a certainty, what we'd really be saying is that probably A will lead to B, and probably B to C etc. From this it does not follow that probably A will lead to Z. Suppose we have 70% confidence in each link, which is probably optimistic for most contexts slippery slope arguments are used. Then even C is less likely to happen than not (49%), D is twice as likely to not happen than happen (34%), E three times as likely to not happen (24%). So even though each step looks inevitable, it doesn't follow that the whole sequence is, making slippery slope arguments invalid."

If I started telling people that Harry Potter has had a positive influence on my life, people would think I'm crazy.   I doubt people would think you're crazy. Books have influenced the actions and perspectives of people for a long time.  We all know that Harry Potter isn’t a physically existing person, but the idea of him does influence existing people. There’s no doubt that actions and events in reality can be linked to inspiration from J.K. Rowling’s books. I don't have a sensual radar that literally detects it, but I see people gather around it in classrooms and theaters all the time. That's real and the lack of physical evidence here won't change that, just as it won't change the faith people have in God.  “Harry Potter isn’t real? Oh no! Wait, wait, what do you mean by real?”"

When the religious are saying that 'God is real', they see the effect that the idea of God has on their life as both the evidence for god, and sometimes even the embodiment of god.

And to answer that question I think it's plainly that there would be no conflict there. I find that answer as obvious and as plain as you find your answer, except you've changed the premise of OP's question which is really where I take issue.

DebateReligion,3e0ef3,5thWatcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:51:47 2015 UTC,"This is an important and often overlooked question. It's uncomfortable territory for most theists who accept that deity is not a physical or temporal phenomena, but it's essential to understanding what a ""relationship with the divine,"" means.  There are two sources of connection to deity in a non-dogmatic, non-physical model of deity: one I will call ""circumstantial"" and one I will call ""spiritual."" There is a large gray area of intersection as well.  The circumstantial is the interaction by virtue of existence. We are a created existence and therefore we interact with the divine through its work in the same way that the viewer interacts with the artist through his work. I might describe the personal relationship that I have with DaVinci through the Mona Lisa, but in the case of human beings interacting with their creator, the connection is more profound. Our intellect is the art and therefore every self-reflective thought is the embodiment of the connection to the divine... that's a fairly deep rabbit hole, and I'm not sure that I can adequately explore its full implications.  The other is the spiritual. If we assert that everything exists in physical and abstract terms--that there is a stone and the idea of the stone; a person and the abstract essence of the person--and that they both have standing as first-class ontological entities, then we can also reasonably discuss the abstract relationship between these entities.  If we define deity as the most abstract essence of everything (potentially plus some undefined additional essence) then the relationship becomes clear: the abstract idea of a person is contained within and therefore in intimate relationship with the divine."

DebateReligion,3e0ef3,sdneidich,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:21:27 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to the theism versus the verification principle.  Theists accept, to some degree, the existence of the supernatural.  Under the verification principle, the supernatural is literally the non-existent, since it's undetectable, immeasurable, may have no natural source and produces no natural evidence of its existence.  An interactive God under any framework violates this principle, as anything supernatural would.  To answer the question, then, the conflict is resolved by accepting on faith that the verification principle is invalid and that supernatural forces exist and potentially affect our lives."

The Bible tells Christians that this relationship is built on the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, and by Pentecost, which was when the Holy Spirit visibly spread across the earth.  Instead, God by His very nature is unknowable (the inability to perceive God's plan is a running theme throughout the Old and New Testaments, despite having prophecies on top of prophecies telling everybody how it was going to go down).  Despite this, it is possible to have a relationship with God. It is, however, by every definition, an uneven relationship."

DebateReligion,3e0ef3,Could-Have-Been-King,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:03 2015 UTC,"Just spitballing, but a couple possible reasons:   When Judaism was first established, the surrounding deities were very personal, very ""real"" (see: not abstract). The Israelites were (according to the Bible) enslaved by the Egyptians, which had actual figures as gods. Then they were enslaved by the Babylonians, which had a similar stance towards their deities. Judaism was formed in between these two major powers that had very personal relationships with their deities, so it's not incredibly far-fetched to believe that they fashioned their own interpretation of their own God in a similar sense (especially since some academics think that the Jewish God is an evolution of a Sumerian deity). God encourages us to have relationships with each other. The Bible identifies community, parentage, friendship, and marriage as fundamental aspects of humanity. Seeing as how God wants us to have relationships with each other, it's not far fetched to want to have a relationship with Him either.  God himself works to have a relationship with us. In Eden, he walks with Adam and Eve. He guides many of the Biblical heroes. In the Gospels, He becomes flesh in the form of Jesus so that we can know him. In the book of Acts, He becomes the Holy Spirit, which is inside each of us.   Have you read the novel ""Daddy-Long_legs""? In the novel, the main character is an orphan who is having her education paid for by a mysterious benefactor who she doesn't know. She writes monthly letters to him, despite knowing barely anything about him. This is sort of my model for my relationship with God: I know He's there, I know He's helping, and I know He loves me.

It also implies one way progress of time which does not exist for God. It's not like first we do this and then God has to respond. He can replay the universe backwards and have all the goodies delivered first and prayers would then look like thank yous.  Religions and religious practices then are not something external to the universe, they are built-in, their rise and fall, prayers and results, are built-in, too. They follow the laws of universe and so are predictable, which we can do to some degree already. Some people take advantage of them and some don't, that's all.   Real relationships with God usually start after we give up our material bodies or at least not on the present bodily platform, it would be soul-to-soul with whatever happening to the body being of no consequence, running in parallel.

DebateReligion,3e41or,ghjm,2,Tue Jul 21 21:14:30 2015 UTC,"I got in a rather heated argument about fundamentalism and the problem with relying on scripture with a Jewish ""friend"" of a friend and I want to be sure my claims, while definitely spurious and specious when viewed in the context of the modern religion (Judaism, non-Rabbinical or Rabbinical) are ""technically correct""; as in, if someone were to pick up the book in a vacuum, read it cover to cover, ""could they come to any of the following conclusions?""   So the answer to that question, reading it cover to cover and knowing everything, is an easy no.  If that were the case, there'd be no need for an oral tradition to explain the laws and words of the Torah.  Jews have a commandment to wear tefillin, but no where does the word tefillin appear in the Torah, however we have a commandment to ""put these signs/ornaments on our hearts and ""totafot"" between our eyes.""  There's no way a simple reading of the Torah would ever lead someone to know what tefillin is, what it looks like, what it contains, and how to wear it (on the bicep and on the hairline).   The Torah does not state that young women in their father's homes have the right to refuse the post-rape marriage in Exodus/Deuteronomy.   You need context here, and context in this case being time period.  Remember, fathers bought husbands for their wives through dowry.  Think of the episode of The Simpsons where Apu meets his wife.  Now, imagine that this deal has been made and your daughter is supposed to marry but suddenly she is raped.  The deal is essentially nullified because the girl was defiled by the rapist.  It's more than a business deal going bad.  It's not like you didn't get your package from Amazon in the mail, but more like finding out your Ashley Madison account info has been hacked and its release could destroy your reputation.  The most fitting outcome is to force the rapist to marry your daughter because no other man that you want to marry your daughter, Mr. Girl's Father, will want to marry her.  This also serves a second purpose.  Now that this man is forced into a marriage, we can see there's room to say he may come to change his ways and man up to being a husband whereas letting him run free would just allow him to rape again.   Female slaves do not have the ""right"" to refuse sexual advances by their masters. [I am not clear on the Jewish teachings regarding sex slaves/slaves. I know Jewish slaves are freed after 7 years, and slaves of Jews are supposed to be relatively well-treated]   No idea on that.  Try asking /r/Judaism.   Virgins captured in conquest are allowed a meaningful choice when it comes to marriage proposals from the conquerors.   Meaning that even though solder A captured her, she can choose to marry soldier B?  Also something I don't know.  I defer to the above suggestion."

DebateReligion,3e0k6p,SERFBEATER,6,Tue Jul 21 00:57:28 2015 UTC,"I lived in a Buddhist monastery for 8 years and considered myself a Buddhist for the vast majority of that time, but not anymore.    My key issue is the ultimate goal of Buddhism, which is ending the cycle of reincarnation (or birth and death as it is commonly phrased).  Most people think enlightenment is the goal, it is not.  Enlightenment is a necessary step, but one can be enlightened and not have ended birth and death.     Things I do like about Buddhism is that it is an orthopraxic religion, not an orthodoxic one.  A Buddhist monk can wake up and declare the Buddha to not be enlightened, and the 4 noble truths and 8 fold path are wrong and nothing will come of it.  ""Meh, he must be having a bad day"" his peers will say.  What is important is the actual practice of Buddhism, not the belief in it.  So if that monk breaks the vows he takes as a monk (such as celibacy) then that is it, he is no longer a monk, end of story.    Additionally, if one does Buddhist practices (leading a moral life, and developing a concentration practice, and developing wisdom) that a person should be able to achieve Buddhahood even if they were never taught Buddhism.  The religion of Buddhism is not necessary to achieve the stated goals.  Even in the Sutras themselves state that near the very end of the goal, one must give up Buddhism in order to take the final step into nirvana.  There is the analogy of the teachings of Buddhism being a raft to carry you across a sea of suffering to arrive at the other shore of bliss, but in order to actually arrive at the shore, one must leave the raft.    There is also a tradition of skepticism within Buddhism, usually highlighted with the Kalama Sutra, where the Buddha goes to the Kalama village and they complain that every week a new spiritual teacher comes decrying the teaching of others, boosting their own teaching, and there are so many of these guys the Kalamas don't know who to believe.  The Buddha exhorts them to not just trust what people say, even the Buddha, but to find things out for themselves."

DebateReligion,3e0k6p,Darth_Thatcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:11 2015 UTC,"I believe so.  For 2,500 years it has been the recognized goal of Buddhists around the world.  Removing reincarnation from Buddhist cosmology would be like someone claiming to be a Christian but not believing in sin, heaven, or hell.    Not all Buddhism in the West is stripped of those teaching either, although Buddhism in popular culture has.  I have no problem with people adapting Buddhist practices to their own benefit, I do take issue with them calling themselves Buddhist when they deny that reincarnation isn't fundamental to Buddhism. I really take issue when they claim to have the true Buddhism and that for 2,500 years everyone else got it wrong.   It is why I don't call myself a Buddhist anymore.  I still live according to most of the principles, but if your end goal isn't escaping birth and death, your goal is not the goal the Buddha taught."
DebateReligion,3e0k6p,markevens,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.   What's always confused me about Buddhism is that the self is not said to be a soul, nor is consciousness said to have any transcendental existence beyond the body. I don't exactly understand how exactly the concept of reincarnation works if there is no transcendent property of the self. If the self does not extend beyond the body or truly exist in any meaningful sense, then how can the karma accrued in one life apply to the next, and what exactly is it that's released from samsara if not some kind of soul?"
DebateReligion,3e0k6p,Darth_Thatcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:05:02 2015 UTC,"Most people have an impression of reincarnation where the western idea of a soul moves from body to body, but that concept of a soul isn't present in Buddhism.   I honestly never got a good grasp on it, as iirc not even consciousness moves from body to body.  My best understanding of it was that the thing that moves is a collection of karmic patterns.    When it comes to the self, in Buddhism that is a mistaken concept that doesn't really exist, so it naturally follows that it wouldn't migrate between reincarnations.  We think the self exists and it distorts our interactions with the world around us but is a a mistaken view.  It would be analogous to an atheist perspective of god not existing, but that doesn't mean people don't believe in god, or take certain things as evidence of god's existence, and that their belief in god has very real consequences in how they interact with the world around them.   That is the basic concept anyway.  I apologize if I'm not to clear on it myself, but as I said before I was taught to not simply accept and repeat the teachings as dogma, but develop my own understanding through my practice.  Those topics are pretty esoteric, and my insights into them are very limited."
DebateReligion,3e0k6p,markevens,2,Tue Jul 21 18:23:55 2015 UTC,"I am far from god and to be honest Buddhism is not a religion for me. It's not a lifestyle either like a lot of hipsters like to call it. For me it's a teaching and a damn solid one too. Every single piece of written Buddhism is pure gold as far as teaching one to be a human being goes and i like it a lot. I'm not a buddhist as I don't really know what it takes to be one. I will probably never visit a monastery other then as a tourist and I have never meditated in my life although this seems like a healthy practice - religion wise or other. Anyway what I do know is that I used to be on a really bad path and it hit me one day that ones life should be different then just leaving broken hearts and destruction behind. I'm talking about stealing every dime I could and leaving no pair of legs unintended in a bed without any further commitment to the girls. In general a bad person. So I looked towards Christianity which ended EVERY single bit of religious person in me. I mean these people are MENTAL! They destruct more in their way then I used to back in the day. Every other religion I looked into was the same mentality, just different names. So i came across Buddhas story and I looked into it and I've been a better person ever since. My ""god"" is balance ever since. Everything has to be as it is with everything it comes with. I've learned to ""manage"" my desires. One cant give up desire, but one surely can follow its desire by not hurting anyone or oneself on the way. Cause lets face it, Siddhārtha had a DESIRE to find an answer, so he followed it and it led him to what he has been seeking. So bottom line I love everything about Buddhism mainly because it spreads a word of peace and actually follows through. I've been trying to follow Buddhas teachings for 5-6 years now and I feel better about myself every day. I have friends, a few really close ones, my girl who is just perfect and a beautiful home that smells good too hehe. If I was forced to choose one I would definately go with Buddhism."

Same thing with the 2nd part... the illnesses you've linked to are illnesses of the mind. Ego death is not a feeling of emptiness, it's a feeling which affects your concept of self. The concept of self disappears and you don't feel empty or lacking because of it; it's also a feeling of oneness; so you are everything and nothing at the same time.

To give some examples, it's the color blue (which may be perceived differently for me and you), it's the sensation of touch, it's the taste of salt. There are subjective experiences we go through for each of these. It's hard to put into words, and there is no external evidence that it exists. I only know that I am experiencing it. I assume that I am no different from other members of my species, so I assume that everyone else experiences qualia as well. It appears that experiencing qualia requires a brain, so I assume that only animals with central nervous systems experience qualia, but any debate on vegetarianism will inevitably bring up the question of whether or not plants experience qualia. They certainly react to stimulus. So that's an unknown; my hunch is no but that's nothing more than a hunch.  I don't want to type too much more here since if we don't agree that qualia exist that's kind of the end of the debate; perhaps you are a p-zombie. Or perhaps I am?"

Everything we have ever made will one day disappear, as everything is impermanent. In the grand scheme of things, every book written, every piece of music composed, every scientific advancement is pointless.     I'd also note here that the eight fold path leaves just as much room for puratan extrmes as other religious moral codes do.     The eightfold path covers everything we consider evil and identified them as wrong. Killing? Wrong action. Doing good for an evil ulterior motive? Wrong intention. This isn't to say that some Buddhists won't do these things regardless, but they have no religious justification.     Utterly incoherent.     The only conclusion I know to draw from this is that you don't understand the concept.     if you truly internalise this idea than congratulations you have now self enduced a diagnosable mental illness. Because yes there is a self, sure its trasient, and will eventually cease to exist but right now while you are reading this it does exist.     If there is indeed anything that can be called the ""self"" I would like to hear about it. Anything that arises, is subject to change, or vanishes cannot be considered the self.

The physical body is made up of these elements (Fire, space, air, earth, water) and no body is carried in Nirvana. It is beyond all the elements, beyond all bodies. There is no direct perceiver to any kind of element that attains nirvana. It is just stateless. Only the ultimate renunciate can get there.

Their actions there on out are done on impulsive buddha consciousness.  What motivation would a buddha have to continue a unique and conscious existence? There is a complete absence of desire that you and I can't comprehend in this moment because we are not buddhas, so you can't fully understand how a buddha doesn't think twice about dropping the body and finishing with nirvana.    no one will be motivated to pursue buddhism   Nirvana did not start with buddhism, though. Even you, as a hindu,  should know that. Any ""hindu"" yogi I've met whos serious, also wants nirvana as well. In hinduism its called Nirvikalpa Samadhi, or Mahasamadhi (great or Final samadhi), when the body is dropped and the yogi leaves.  Nirvikalpa Samadhi is nirvana, though its just the name of it, samadhi is not actually possible in nirvana.    Nirvikalpa Samadhi is the end of a really long journey of conscious bliss states. After the individual experiences these conscious bliss states through renunciation and meditation, they begin to lose sight of this mundane world, they do not want to participate in the delusions that are so rampant in the mundane world. So, gradually they get closer until they finally make the ULTIMATE renunciation which is nirvana, where everything is let go completely.  Nirvana is not a self contradiction.   It's saying that consciousness is the background in which bliss states arise, in which all things arise. So these are states, Samadhi, Waking world, Dreaming, etc. Nirvana is going past this background, the background dissolves completely. So its not a ""state"" since there is no perceiver, it can't apply as a state. So its called the stateless state.  How can there be feeling once the perceiver and perceived are dissolved?    You have to clarify how exactly a person that attained nirvana is different from the insentient stone   The human body is the great birth opportunity for Nirvana, thats why. The body was equipped with the conditioned elements, to clear the way for the Nirvana which is beyond condition and unconditioned. A human body is perfectly equipped for proper meditation, which is what leads to these goals. Meditation is the only way we could possibly do this. An animal is made of the same elements, but conditioned in a way that they can't meditate and make the same decisions as us. They have consciousness, but don't have the same unique opportunity. A stone is one element, just matter. It is not born out of anything, does not die out of anything, does not manifest.    is a stone beyond existence and non existence or not and why?   A stone is exists through condition, this body exists through condition. Nirvana is not conditioned or unconditioned. Which is why it's said this body really doesn't mean anything outside of being a vessel. A body perceives and is a perceiver through senses. A stone is perceived but does not perceive.

He had his way, and he articulated his way in case it might help others, but you do not have to explicitly follow what he said to the letter, because (as the saying goes) there are many paths up the same mountain.  St. Augustine, when asked what the one thing someone needed to know if they knew nothing else to find peace, replied, ""Love."" Confucius said that he would not teach students who did not love to learn, not for itself, but because loving to learn should mean you eagerly care about knowing what's right in order to do what has the best possible outcome. Epicurus said that to achieve peace of mind and to obtain a happy life, the most important thing in life is friendship. Lao-Tzu said that being loved gives you strength, and loving gives you courage.  Buddha's words are recommendations, suggestions. But everyone must find their own way. But you don't need to know anything. When Jesus' followers saw someone casting out demons just as they did, but not as a follower, Jesus said to not stop him, but to let him do good work. You don't have to follow anyone.

If it is, then wouldn't there be no suffering in your life? Someone who has attained everlasting peace, what motivation would they have to do anything anymore?   Ever lasting peace is not really ""attained"" or ""found"". Ever lasting peace happens when a buddhist rightfully discriminates what is ignorance and delusion, so they cast it away and real peace arises, being content with circumstances and with nothing.   Food should be given to a starving person, but again, when its gone its back to feeling like a hungry beggar. Money makes you feel proud, and when its gone it turns you into a beggar again, etc.    Which isn't good for them   Why isn't it good? It keeps them alive.

I don't see how ""verifiable and quantifiable"" are the demarcation criteria here.  In fact, the scientific method was developed by people like Francis Bacon who already believed in God, and they did in fact leave the nature of God up to theology (hence the name, theo-logy).  God's being rational was part of what science took into account when it began formulating ideas about natural laws.  You could arguably say that God was the very reason taken into account that allowed predictive models to be constructed in the first place.  FInally, given that theists have been in science since it started, I really don't see a proof of God's existence causing any major change in science like 1_Marauder predicts, except a demographic shift."

But again, this is not maths proving things about reality - because you have to verify that the initial conditions and the operations are valid.

God, however, is not a subject to any laws and can break all of them at will at any moment. He is also outside of influence of time, for that matter.

If so, no, that's pointless. There's no practical difference between that and atheism. When you see a religious person making an argument like that, it's because they have some sort of followup argument in which they attempt to prove that this creator is actually the God of their religion.

I'd ask this, to get an idea of what sort of evidence you'd like.

DebateReligion,3e01am,killing_buddhas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I asked my mom this question a lot when I was really little. ""How do we know that our religion is 'right' if we don't have proof? And because we're Christian, does that mean we think that every other religion is wrong?""   About the former- in my opinion, if something feels right to you, you should follow it. There may not be solid ""proof"" of a God. But if I pray to God to help my friend when she's sick, or pray when I'm sad, and in the future my friend isn't sick and I'm not sad, that's great. It felt good and 'right' for me to pray in those situations. So I did. And I have a strong faith in a God, which makes praying feel ""right"" to me.   If I read in the bible that it says to ""stone someone to death"" if they don't follow a petty rule, and it doesn't feel right to do that (which, it obviously shouldn't), then I shouldn't stone someone to death. It's that simple. If it doesn't feel right to me then I shouldn't do it.   And the latter- are we saying that every other religion is wrong- no. How my mom used to answer that question is ""Different people have different ways to get to God. To me, none of them are 'wrong' or 'right'. And the reason that they have faith is because it is how they justify being a good person and living a wholesome life. If you live a good, wholesome life, I don't think it should matter how you justify it.""   So basically, to me, I don't need proof. Some people say that there is finite proof of a God, but they are mostly pretty weak or one-sided arguments. In my opinion I will keep believing in a God even if there is 0 evidence of one, because that's what feels right to me, and that's how I justify being a good person. Other people and other faiths might think differently about a God or if Jesus really turned water into wine or that sort of thing. But as long as they're not an asshole about what they believe, I don't think it should matter."

I think that's a good rule of thumb. But if, hypothetically, there is absolute finite proof that there is not a God? I'm still going to treat my neighbors how I want to be treated. That's just the rule I follow in my head.   I believe in God because I do. If for some hypothetical reason there was no possibility that there was a God, I would still be a good person, because that's how I live my life. I base it on my faith.

In my opinion I will keep believing in a God even if there is 0 evidence of one, because that's what feels right to me, and that's how I justify being a good person.   So it is okay if everyone start believing in The Flying Spaghetti Monster and Santa Claus if it feels right and it is how the justify being a good person?   Other people and other faiths might think differently about a God or if Jesus really turned water into wine or that sort of thing.   Funny thing, even if sufficient evidence for Jesus turning water into wine appear, it would still not be evidence for god, it would only prove that Jesus turned water into wine."

DebateReligion,3dxpmt,potzdamn,7,Mon Jul 20 11:56:25 2015 UTC,"I accept the doctrine of original sin on faith. The Catholic Church teaches the doctrine of original sin, there is massive evidence that the Catholic Church is the true church founded and guided by God.   I do not need evidence for each and every doctrine of the Catholic faith, because I have plenty of evidence for the Catholic faith as a whole.  If I see something in a math book I will generally accept it even if I have not gone through the proof myself. A lot of experience suggests that math books are pretty trust worthy, so I may accept the concept on the trust or faith I have in math text books. A similar argument could be made for chemistry and physics texts.  I do not accept what telemarketers say on faith. They are not trust worthy.  Faith is not about ignoring evidence, it is about considering all the evidence, seeing the big picture.  There tends to be a conflict between the concept of religious faith and science in part because in science it is very important that at least a few people look closely at narrow issues, ignoring the big picture.   When we look through a microscope we can see very small things, at the cost of not seeing most of what is going on in the room. When we look through a telescope we can see things that are very far away, at the cost of not seeing most of the sky. In an experiment we narrowly focus on what happens when we keep everything but one factor the same. Scientific investigation requires us to narrow our focus. It also requires skepticism.  We need enough skeptics to thoroughly check and recheck results. Scientists frequently become so enamored by the idea of skepticism that think that everyone should always be skeptical about everything. Everyone is supposed to repeat every experiment. Every student should reprove every theorem. At some point this becomes impractical.    As a Catholics we are encouraged to supplement faith with understanding, but while we seek reasons we do not demand reasons."

DebateReligion,3dxpmt,wolffml,7,Tue Jul 21 04:59:23 2015 UTC,"I have defined ""faith"" as being the rejection of reasoning or evidence which falls in opposition with the beliefs you have regarding how things are or should be. This was disagreed with and plenty of people insisted that faith required evidence.   Of course a rejection of reason would be illogical, but this hardly seems charitable or something that a theist could ever agree too. Your definition necessarily ""poisons the well,"" and I don't think this is what the theist is committed to when they speak of faith.  (As a side note, I've taken the position in the past that faith is something like ""confidence in the truth of a proposition that is greater than what is warranted by the probability that the proposition is true."")  If you'd like a little broader idea of what theists and theologians mean when speaking of faith, take a look at the variety of models of faith available at SEP.  Alvin Plantinga (an American Philosopher and Christian) thinks of faith in a very different way from you (or I).  In his epistemology, faith is an additional path towards knowledge.  From SEP   One model identifies faith as knowledge of specific truths, revealed by God.  ...  In defence of specifically Christian belief, Plantinga argues that the same warrant-conferring status belongs to the operation of the Holy Spirit in making the great truths of the Gospel directly known to the believer."

I'm not sure that you've shown here where faith requires evidence.  The thought of Reformed Epistemology is that faith is another path to knowledge and constitutes evidence in and of itself (through the inner witness of the Holy Spirit).  It is through this certain knowledge of the truths of the Bible, that a Christian knows something like Original Sin.  (Which I think you give too broad a application here - the Christianity in which I grew up did not have the original sin doctrine.  From their doctrinal perspective, it is not original sin that damns us -- it is our actual sin as individuals that does so.)"

DebateReligion,3dxpmt,Being_and_Thyme,8,Mon Jul 20 18:51:38 2015 UTC,"I think that your definition is a good one. The things that I could be said to have ""faith"" in are very personal matters which one's ego holds very dear and even ""protects"" from evidence to the contrary:   Love exists. My daughter is the cutest thing that ever did was. (This is obviously, objectively true.) My cat is a deadly North American house puma and I'm doing the world a favor by not letting him outside to destroy every living thing in a 100 mile radius. And the only reason I remain alive is that I'm basically Owen Grady.   I think theists use faith to make equally absurd claims, except they're claims that impact others and they habitually fail to be able to separate personal beliefs like those above from beliefs which others should have any reason to hold.  Faith only requires the lowest form of evidence, personal experience, which is why it isn't good at resolving knowledge for more than one person."
DebateReligion,3dxpmt,platoandfriends,2,Mon Jul 20 12:37:08 2015 UTC,"I think your formulation, in agreeing with OP, is misleading and falsely frames the issue as one in which the theist faces a dichotomy of sorts between faith and a competing evidential alternative--to the extent that faith is mutually exclusive with reason and that theism is necessarily tied to justification via faith alone. But this betrays both the literature on faith and the way some theists are said to practice or maintain an attitude of faith.   Part of the issue is that you've construed faith as taken to be a means for establishing the truth of proposition, namely faith is the means to establish that X exists. Some theists may take it this way, but it would be misleading to stop there and generalize to the whole of theists--especially when theists don't even necessarily practice their faith in this way.  What's missing is that aspect of faith in which it is viewed as a commitment. I hasten to use Abraham as an example, due to the blatant moral reprehensibility of his act, but I'm going to use it anyway because Abraham's conduct isn't taken (under some interpretations) by Christians as a model for behaviour. Rather, the relevant content of his act of faith was not directed at sacrificing Isaac, but instead a trust in God fulfilling his promise: namely, that Isaac would be the next patriarch of the Jewish people (which he obviously fulfilled according to the narrative).  Here we can see the relevant difference: Abraham's faith is not in the proposition ""God exists""-- it's in God fulfilling his promise. Also notice how this interpretation doesn't commit the theist to thinking that faith in every circumstance is warranted.   Now obviously we will question what justification the theist has in believing in the proposition that God exists to such an extent that they then venture to commitment, but I think the relevant part of the discussion here is that faith is not exclusively understood as the ascent to the truth of a proposition. If were willing to accept that much, then we should be willing to accept that faith can be rational--in that it is can sometimes be an appropriate commitment."

DebateReligion,3dxpmt,platoandfriends,2,Mon Jul 20 19:48:37 2015 UTC,"You're welcome to be the first in history to justify religion in any way but personal faith and experience.   I'm not sure what you mean. Personal experience isn't by a necessity a mark of faith, in that one has faith their personal experience is indicative of a state of affairs--unless you mean to frame it as I trust that my experience reflects a particular state of affairs, but then your falsely conflating the understanding of faith again by getting several things mixed up: firstly from your definition early in which you assumed faith only meant a particular act without reasons; and secondly from how it isn't necessarily present in one's experience, in that my experience of a table is evidence that there are tables--not that I have faith that tables exist.  And this is where I think your formulation of the issue as one in which there has never been a recorded instance of religion being justified via anything other than personal faith and experience is misleading at best and a red-herring at worst--as it construes the philosophic tradition going back to the medieval period as essentially rooted in a particular understanding of one's experience as beyond the scope of being truth-apt and religious experience specifically as of this sort. It also assumes only one type of justified means, namely one that isn't rooted in experience. Everyday experience was a starting point for some, but it was by no means exhaustive. Additionally, your construal seems to ignore those arguments that theists take as warrant for belief that have evidential premises, and which were argued over extensively going back to the medieval period. I think then that your comment here misses much about what exactly is happening in these arguments for religious claims.   You're making a distinction that doesn't exist. You can't have it one way without the other, that's the problem.   Clearly the distinction either exists or we have some warrant to believe that such a distinction does exist, since it purports that one need not have faith in order to be justified in the initial proposition whose truth only then leads to faith as a venture or commitment.   You said it wasn't necessarily a matter of truth but what else do people commit themselves to except their perception of the truth?   I said it wasn't necessarily a matter of truth in the establishment of a proposition, such as in your example of ""love exists."" The distinction here would be that one be justified in accepting love exists for some other such reasons which then leads to a faith that a particular person will love you back, for example."

There isn't anything like sufficient rational justification for the idea, in philosophy or science.

So for me the key remark would be: without faith in the first place (since faith in God is precluded by non-acceptance of the idea of God, i.e. unbelief), how does one come to assent to the idea of God?   So there's a distinction that we need to be aware of here. There's a difference between faith that you must already have in order to even accept certain propositions as true--which themselves might only be accessible via faith--and a general belief that leads one to further beliefs and so forth. The former is part of the literature on faith. But the latter case I don't think we should find too upsetting, because to some extent any sort of hypothesizing can involve a belief in a certain state of affairs that we might have or not have sufficient warrant to believe at a given moment, that we might then go test to confirm or whatever.   If that's the case though, I'm not sure what's the problem. Theists have a belief in a particular state of affairs first and they go and attempt to find epistemic warrant for it, and perhaps they find epistemic defeaters along the way. Some concede and their theism is pacified somewhat, and for others its not and remains strong. But the point seems to be that their belief coming first doesn't by necessity pose any problems, any more than it should if I have a belief about another given matter that I think is justified and which I seek to confirm or explore later. Indeed I do that all the time.   However, and this has been pointed out in other ways below, this leaves you with a whole as to why one would accept the idea of God. There isn't anything like sufficient rational justification for the idea, in philosophy or science.   That's far from an uncontentious point. Part of the problem here is you've provided no standard for what counts as sufficient rational justification--nor would I expect you to explicate an entire methodology right now for determining that. But you can understand how part of the debate is precisely in what counts as sufficient justification for belief in the first place. Because there are certainly arguments out there, contemporary ones that is, that are touted as at a minimum warranting belief."

In this case, it's the term belief. If we're talking about a belief in general terms, i.e. giving assent to a proposition that has sufficient evidence to advance it, then that's different to a Belief, which would be the acceptance of a claim in the sort of way that OP means - unrelated to evidence (though not necessarily against it). In this sense I'm not sure I can really see a substantial difference between your ideas of faith and belief.  I'd like to generally avoid the complications of discussing whether there are sufficient grounds for accepting the god hypothesis. What I want to understand is, assuming most people don't come to believe that hypothesis through rational means, how then, by your understanding, do they come to believe?  It's 4.30 am here, so that might not make sense and I'd really better get to sleep."

I've been using belief as it is defined on the SEP:   Contemporary analytic philosophers of mind generally use the term “belief” to refer to the attitude we have, roughly, whenever we take something to be the case or regard it as true.   There's no requirement for reflection or even sufficient evidence, although those might be present. It is simply to take something to be the case. This removes your distinction entirely, as someone who holds a ""belief"" and someone who holds a ""Belief"" both have the same attitude towards a given proposition.  In terms of faith, I haven't been using it necessarily as a synonym for belief, although in my previous comment I mentioned faith as a form of special knowledge and faith as a form of belief, but I've attempted to keep room for faith being understood also as a venture, an attitude, a commitment, a sort of existential confidence, and as trust."

The more general type of 'belief' is entirely evidence-based, and basically just a process of rational conversion of empirical positions into more usable (from an evolutionary perspective) deductive-type logically-certain conclusions. The religious type of 'Belief' is not related to evidence in this way, and it certainly isn't a process resembling the earlier."
DebateReligion,3dxpmt,HighPriestofShiloh,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:57 2015 UTC,"Could you link me to a source? A quick survey of the SEP on belief didn't yield this distinction--or at least it didn't yield it via the way you've framed it.  To what degree it's relevant I'm not sure yet. They quite manifestly do have the same attitude towards the proposition, because whether their attitude is evidence-based (even if you're limiting evidence to sensory experience of the natural world) or not, they still take a particular proposition or states of affairs as to be the case. This doesn't change. Further to this, the definitions of faith certainly don't suggest this distinction or a way in which faith is without reason."

It's not an appropriate tool for this purpose - you don't look for theory in a dictionary. Do you want references to show it's a part of the discourse or to help you understand the idea?

The method is so completely different as to render them entirely different phenomena. The point is that with Belief one starts with the conclusion. Whether you decide to search for or accept evidence is entirely optional, and how evidence is able to undermine or falsify that conclusion is unclear. With belief in general, it can only be sustained with sufficient evidence, and once that evidence is removed or undermined, the conclusion is equally undermined."

It's not an appropriate tool for this purpose - you don't look for theory in a dictionary.   I'm afraid that is just nonsense. The SEP was recommended to me by my dissertation supervisor and I referenced in my dissertation just fine for elaborations on theory and as a jumping off point for further sources. Further to this, I have referenced it in submissions to academic journals, and so far they have not requested I remove them. It is by far an appropriate tool for this purpose given its accessible nature, its authority, and its comprehensiveness.    The method is so completely different as to render them entirely different phenomena. The point is that with Belief one starts with the conclusion. Whether you decide to search for or accept evidence is entirely optional, and how evidence is able to undermine or falsify that conclusion is unclear. With belief in general, it can only be sustained with sufficient evidence, and once that evidence is removed or undermined, the conclusion is equally undermined.   I'm still not seeing the relevance of this distinction. The attitude whether it is reached non-reflectively or deliberatively or with sufficient evidence is still at its heart an attitude that something is the case--and a person need not have faith in order to have Belief, in fact faith could be of lower case ""b"" belief as well, since conceivably someone could have something like a sustained faithful existential confidence grounded in some sort of evidence. This distinction isn't going help us to differentiate anything. We might as well just stick to belief, and then wonder if said is belief is justified."
DebateReligion,3dxpmt,Sickeboy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:41:52 2015 UTC,"Faith only requires the lowest form of evidence, personal experience   I think is even lower than that.  I think for many people a belief supported by faith is often based on hope.  They hope their worldview is accurate so they believe it to be so.   They hope that their faith has a positive impact on their life so they believe their faith a somewhat accurate model of reality.    This obviously depends on the theists, but growing up I ran into a lot of Christians that had nothing more than a hope that they weren't wasting their time every sunday (ignoring the obvious social benefit that church offers)."

What most rational atheists would assent to is the (distinct) idea that:   if something cannot be scientifically or philosophically explained or understood it is not meaningful.   The meaningful bit is the key. So an unfalsifiable idea might be true in the end, but most rational atheists don't consider unfalsifiable ideas to be meaningful.

I can hold that the idea of god existing isn't meaningful (because 'god' isn't defined, the proposition is unfalsifiable), but that doesn't mean I'm saying it's untrue. It just means that I'm not going to assent to it because I'm not able to test it sufficiently.  Think about it like police work. You'll have seen plenty of detective shows where the unconventional rule-breaker detective finds things that aren't permissable in court. Technically, the case is no stronger than it was in the beginning - and for an outside who doesn't know how awesome and trustworthy the detective is, they might have made up or planted the details that led them to the conviction of a certain person as a murderer. The entire department might know that this person is a murderer based on this impermissible evidence, but the case is still technically the same as at square one. They need proper, scrutinisable, officially and transparently obtained evidence to make the case.  That's a very imperfect analogy, but you hopefully see what I mean."

DebateReligion,3dxpmt,Sickeboy,4,Mon Jul 20 15:59:39 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I was trying to give a charitable analogy, but you've abused it there.    it proves the murderer was guilty.   To whom? It would prove the murder is guilty to the detective, because they know that they obtained the evidence. However, to an impartial bystander, they have no idea where that evidence came from, and so the case is not stronger. This would be the position of any police department. Even if they trusted the detective, they would probably recognise that on the one hand, trusting them, this person was probably the murderer, but on the other, officially and impartially, there is no evidence for that.  Let's move on.  This is nothing to do with 'bias' or with arbitrary decisions. It's to do with how we accept propositions. Would you accept my idea that the world is made of cheese? Probably not. Why? Because you can examine and test that idea, and show it to be incorrect - it is not only falsifiable, but readily and easily falsifiable. Now, would you accept my belief that there is an invisible, undetectable, dragon living in my basement? Probably not. You might not be able to prove it wrong, because each test you propose I would simply explain why that wouldn't detect it. However, you probably wouldn't accept the proposition, because as you can't measure it, you can't know if it's true. So, you would not assent to it - i.e. you wouldn't consider it meaningful, though you wouldn't necessarily be able to prove it to be wrong."

So, you would not assent to it - i.e. you wouldn't consider it meaningful, though you wouldn't necessarily be able to prove it to be wrong.   I consider it meaningless because of the faith i have in God who doesn't consider it meaningful (scripture combined with observing ability). there is nothing in the ways God allows me to determine things that leads to consider the dragon meaningful, neither in what i can observe nor what he tells me about the things i cannot. this is my faith.  you would consider the claim of the dragon meaningles because you cannot observe the dragon. this, i would argue, is your faith."

You missed the point of my 'to whom'. We're not talking here about a global immutable truth. We're talking about why atheists don't consider the god-proposition as meaningful if it's so vague as to be unfalsifiable and without measurable corroborating evidence. It has nothing to do with faith or bias, it's just the most reasonable position for them to take.  Do you really think that the reasonable thing for the court to do would be to trust the detective? In isolation, I think that would be absolutely stupid. They have methods and transparency for a reason, and the detective chose not to follow them. That would establish his untrustworthiness regardless of anything else. That's also not considering it in true analogy to belief.  What if there's another detective who has equally impermissible evidence for another murderer? What if there are five detectives, or twenty, or hundreds, each having different impermissible evidence for different murderers? In fact, have you ever see the show Psych? What if each of these hundreds of detectives does not in fact have just impermissible evidence, but they each have 'personal intuition', or 'psychic senses'. Should they trust any of them? No, of course they shouldn't. In fact, I'd probably discipline or fire them for their poor process, and for wasting court time.   I consider it meaningless because of the faith i have in God who doesn't consider it meaningful (scripture combined with observing ability). there is nothing in the ways God allows me to determine things that leads to consider the dragon meaningful, neither in what i can observe nor what he tells me about the things i cannot. this is my faith. you would consider the claim of the dragon meaningles because you cannot observe the dragon. this, i would argue, is your faith.   Ok, unusual reason of which I'm a little sceptical. It's unnatural cognition to justify everything by what god specifically rejects.  Anyway, I don't have any faith in this. I just wouldn't accept the proposition. That doesn't require any faith at all. I don't have faith that there isn't a dragon in my basement, I just don't accept the proposition, and I assume therefore, in a practical way, that there is no such dragon."

We're not talking here about a global immutable truth.   but when talking to theist, it certainly is always about global immutable truth. that's is the idea of theism: ""there is a God, that is the truth.""   e're talking about why atheists don't consider the god-proposition as meaningful if it's so vague as to be unfalsifiable and without measurable corroborating evidence.   like i have discussed somewhere else in this thread, Christians (that what i am, cant speak for the others) do believe they have a certain amount of corroborating evidence, evidence that shows the possibility and likelihood of Gods existence. this evidence is not (usually) solely the basis of their belief, but it is there.

I just don't accept the proposition, and I assume therefore, in a practical way, that there is no such dragon.   but isn't this an act of faith in itself, you simply don't accept the proposition. this is what you believe to be true or meaningful, but its not based on proof but on a priory assumed actuality (hope that makes sense, the words are tough to find).  i would say it requires some faith, namely that the world you know so far (on without dragons) is the true (or meaningful) world, and that therefore there are no dragons."

For example, I have faith that the sun will rise every morning because my knowledge of science and my experiences of living in a world in which the sun rises every morning lead to me believe that I should reasonably expect it to happen again.

Simply by virtue of these accounts existing, it does not make them evidence for the things they record. So, when Herodotus talks about giant gold digging ants, that is not automatically evidence of gold digging ants. It might be evidence of a tradition of gold digging ants (i.e. it's evidence that some people at the time told stories about them), but it isn't really evidence of gold digging ants actually existing.  Likewise, no self-respecting historian is going to accept the Biblical tradition as evidence for the supernatural aspects of Jesus' life, like his resurrection, turning water into wine, or reviving others from the dead. These stories are not considered evidence that these things actually happened.  So I do agree with you - it is a difference in what theists consider evidence. But I would argue that calling it 'evidence' is really using the term inappropriately. One could call it 'justification' or 'reason', but 'evidence' means something different. It does, ultimately, rely on beliefs."

DebateReligion,3dxpmt,platoandfriends,2,Mon Jul 20 15:29:24 2015 UTC,"You said ""calling it 'evidence' is really using the term inappropriately"". There are numerous types of evidence, although not each is considered as such in every framework. Testimony, for example is considered evidence in a court of law, but it does not meet the empirical standards of the scientific method. Whether or not it is appropriate really depends on your point of view. In other words, I think you are quite correct, Socrates."
DebateReligion,3dxpmt,JustDoItPeople,2,Mon Jul 20 16:49:27 2015 UTC,"Socrates' intention was to highlight the paradox of accepting relative truth as absolute truth. It doesn't have much to do with different definitions of things.   It's an inappropriate definition of evidence, I would argue, on several counts. First, because the context we're talking about is history, and by the historical method, it is not evidence. Secondly, because it doesn't work with the reportive definitions of evidence in this sense, and as a stipulative definition they would have to make it quite clear why their use of the term is appropriate for this meaning, and what the meaning is. In this case, usually the reason that the term 'evidence' is used, I would argue, is to by into the authority that this term has, and to suggest rational/intellectual/scientific justification. Those are not good justifications for using a largely unrelated term with a personal stipulative definition.  I was also making a quite specific point there. Testimony is evidence, in history, for certain things. However, it is not always evidence for the obvious thing that most people would assume it is, namely, the actual event it records. I posted this below and I think it (unusually, for me) neatly explains what I mean in relation to the example of Herodotus and the story of the gold-digging ants in 3.105-7:   the evidence supports the assertion that, for instance:   Herodotus wrote about gold-digging ants. It was a common story in Greece at the time that in India there were gold-digging ants.   However, it does not strictly support that:   Herodotus believed that in India there were gold-digging ants. (Side note - he was at the very least not convinced, looking at his language.)   ...and certainly not that:   In India in this period there really were giant gold-digging ants."

In this case, usually the reason that the term 'evidence' is used, I would argue, is to by into the authority that this term has, and to suggest rational/intellectual/scientific justification.   I disagree with these points, at least in some cases. It depends on how literally the theist is taking the story of original sin. In my opinion the ""fall"" is not the documentation of someone eating an actual fruit, it's an allegory used to illustrate a deeper spiritual truth. We take the testimony of the prophets on faith, and our observation of history is part of the evidence that justifies our faith.   I would say you are absolutely correct that it would be false to claim to have evidence if my assertion was that it is literally true that once upon a time some chick ate an apple and that's why we all become corpses. However, what is important to this story is not the absolute veracity of the details, but that our sinful behavior has consequences that reach far beyond the individual.   To illustrate: let us assume that slavery, for example, is a sin. By examining history we can reasonably deduce that the plight of blacks in modern society is a direct result of the repercussions which have rippled throughout society. They personally are not responsible for their condition, and yet they still suffer the wages of that sin.   Because our ancestors were disobedient to the spirit of loving-kindness and presumed to be the authority of what is good and what is evil, society as a whole has suffered spiritual death. We have fallen away from the paradise that could have been ours. The history of slavery can therefore be considered anecdotal evidence that supports the doctrine of original sin - but only if we begin with a faith that is true.  The lesson it is teaching us is not that we should believe unequivocally in two people named Adam and Eve, but that we should remember that we are not the only ones who may be punished for our crimes. Every time we sin, we eat that apple. We damn ourselves and our neighbors. I no longer have to take that doctrine on faith, I have examined the evidence with my own eyes.   In a similar fashion I have analyzed many other testimonial/scriptural claims, and repeatedly found them to have merit. I have rebelled against some and witnessed the pain it causes. I have found the popular interpretations of some to be based upon faulty premises. I would argue that my faith does have rational/intellectual/scientific justification.  By applying this process I am able to weed out those claims (or interpretations) which are invalid, but it leaves me with an even stronger belief that, while I may have been wrong about what I believe God is, with each revelation I have grown more confident that God is. Though I cannot prove that to be true, I have accumulated a very large body of evidence which assures me I am on the right path.   As I keep applying myself to this study, I continually draw closer to ""Him"". Faith is the inspiration which drives my acquisition of knowledge. It is not supposed to be blind for that leads us down blind alleys, and though we may stumble upon the truth we will not know it when we find it. I would concur with your argument when applied to some individuals, but not if we are making sweeping generalizations about theists."

That's not history, or at least, it's not how academic history works. We don't have ideologies and then search for rationalisations or justifications for them. That wouldn't really be evidence in this sense. Picking a significant idea, not really linked to any specific event, and then using events or trends in history to both prove its existence, and show its influence, isn't sound method. Let me lay out how you could work towards sound method in your example of sin. First you'd have to explain precisely what 'sin' is, and show that it exists without question-begging. Then you'd need to show that sinful behaviour can be measured and examined, and how evidence for sinful behaviour would work.    To illustrate: let us assume that slavery, for example, is a sin. By examining history we can reasonably deduce that the plight of blacks in modern society is a direct result of the repercussions which have rippled throughout society. They personally are not responsible for their condition, and yet they still suffer the wages of that sin.   This isn't good method at all. You've selected an extremely broad and vague idea and then subjugated history into its fold. You haven't shown that sin exists in the first place, and you seem to be using this example both as evidence for this idea of sin, and evidence of it. You can't do either, in reality, but you certainly can't do both.   but only if we begin with a faith that is true.   This is the crux of the problem. Evidence is about justification for a proposition. But this faith is self-justifying, and the 'evidence' is selected from within an ideological framework that already interprets everything with reference to these central ideas. The 'evidence' is disposable. So, it is neither evidence in its form nor its function.   I no longer have to take that doctrine on faith, I have examined the evidence with my own eyes.   Note the 'no longer'. This is not rational process, as you've been quite forthcoming about. I'm not trying to trick you or practice rhetorics here, I'm just observing that this process really precludes the idea of having 'evidence' in this way. If you begin with a certain proposition that is self-justifying, the 'evidence' for this proposition is the proposition itself (or other factors) - it isn't the points referenced by advocates already holding the proposition.  Justification is a term with which I have less issue. But, if I'm honest, I'm quite uncomfortable with using the term 'evidence' when it comes to things like this."
DebateReligion,3dxpmt,platoandfriends,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"That's not history, or at least, it's not how academic history works.   Understood. I'm not providing evidence for history, I'm providing evidence for my faith. I was showing how history itself can be evidence for something else.   First you'd have to explain precisely what 'sin' is, and show that it exists without question-begging.    As defined by the Catholic Church: Sin is an offense against reason, truth, and right conscience; it is failure in genuine love for God and neighbor caused by a perverse attachment to certain goods. It wounds the nature of man and injures human solidarity. It has been defined as ""an utterance, a deed, or a desire contrary to the eternal law.""

That is another form of evidence - things we just intuitively know, and in which we trust because we have faith in ourselves. Does it need to be quantifiably measured? Can it be? Are any of us really qualified to judge another's behavior? Ultimately it is a matter of opinion. The aggregate evaluation of that a priori knowledge leads us to determine ""this is bad"" or ""this is good"". Morality isn't a scientific method, it's an art. And, largely, a matter of opinion. Those opinions can, and do, lead us to make mistakes when we lose sight of higher principles. We're only human.   and how evidence for sinful behaviour would work.   My example was the illustration of how the evidence works. Here's another: The Bible teaches us that we should be humble. Would you agree that our frequent arrogance is evidence that we should have listened, or do we need to quantify that observation before we can put some faith in the conclusion?   You haven't shown that sin exists in the first place, and you seem to be using this example both as evidence for this idea of sin, and evidence of it.   I made it very clear that it was an assumption. I didn't feel like delving into the ""fact"" of sin because I believe it is self-evident and, more importantly, the truth is irrelevant to the story, just as the fact that most animals do not really talk is irrelevant to the morals of Aesop's fables. I understand why you have objections to many claims about religion, but I'm not using it as a history book and I don't believe the story about original sin was really about a talking snake. I do, however, believe that we can take our own experience, as well as the body of scientific knowledge, and compare that evidence to religious claims and reinforce our faith in those lessons (which we usually do not comprehend deeply at first reading.)   Evidence is about justification for a proposition.   That's exactly how I used it. The proposition is that our ancestors have sinned and we pay the price for that fall from grace. By simply observing history, or the effects of our behavior on those around us, we can see that this claim is true. By being mindful of this we also begin to learn what is ""good"" for us and what is ""bad"", and we begin to see that there is a great deal of wisdom being carried through the generations by these scriptures and those who reflect upon them. We can get bogged down in the details about flaming swords and magic trees, but they're not important. (Well, there's some really deep and rich symbolism which could take a lifetime to understand, but I'm keeping this simple and focusing on the topic at hand.)   But, if I'm honest, I'm quite uncomfortable with using the term 'evidence' when it comes to things like this.   I'm fine with that. As you said, we have different definitions of what qualifies as evidence. Pointing out how the fallout of slavery relates to the doctrine of original sin is not meant to provide irrefutable empirical evidence that sin does indeed exist, or to confirm any of the details of the tale as historically accurate. It was not written to tell us that sin exists, it serves to show us why it is bad and encourages us to think of society as a whole instead of only our own selfish interests. To many people, slavery is not considered a sin. If we take on faith that there is truth behind the story of original sin, history can teach us why it is. Your brand of analysis is critical to revealing historical truth, but it takes a more abstract approach to reveal spiritual truth. These are entirely different spheres of study. We share some of the same tools of investigation, but we apply them differently. I think that's the way it should be."

Would you not agree that, by this definition, trampling human dignity by enslaving people for material gain is sinful behavior?   Most of this tells us what it does, not what it is. As for 'it is failure...' that's far too vague, this relies on another assumption (i.e. of God's existence), which is actually the thing that reference to 'sin' is purporting to provide evidence for. It's question-begging, in other words. This also does nothing to explain the actual mechanism whereby failure to love god or attachment to worldly goods is related to sin. What is this eternal law? How does sin relate to it. That is not an explanation. They're words, but they don't have explanatory value. So, I ask again, what is a sin?

Those opinions can, and do, lead us to make mistakes when we lose sight of higher principles. We're only human.   There are a whole load of bald assertions in there, and they're not unproblematic. Ethics observably is a science. We can - and ought to - develop explicit, clear, and grounded ethical systems, based on a fundamental definition of morality and ethics. Ethics I would define as a system of behaviour dedicated to ensuring the: i) life, ii) well-being, and iii) happiness of people (and I'm not excluding animals here). Then it's a science of determining how to achieve this in the greatest degree. As we've learned more about the way the world really is, through scientific advancement, we've likewise been able to make moral progress. In the West we've begun to address wealth inequality in basic ways, we've established basic rights for humans and animals, and we've worked towards making a fair world. We're making progress all of the time - just observe the equal marriage laws, which are a symbol of the latest stint of moral progress.   Would you agree that our frequent arrogance is evidence that we should have listened, or do we need to quantify that observation before we can put some faith in the conclusion?   I can't possibly assent to that, because it contains within it 100+ propositions and beliefs to which I cannot assent. This is a consistent problem with the arguments you're making! They're self-referential and self-supporting. You have to start from scratch if we're going to talk about 'evidence', otherwise it isn't evidence but disposable, subjective, supporting justification for a rationalisation.   I made it very clear that it was an assumption. I didn't feel like delving into the ""fact"" of sin because I believe it is self-evident and, more importantly, the truth is irrelevant to the story, just as the fact that most animals do not really talk is irrelevant to the morals of Aesop's fables.   You think that I'm arguing against biblical literalism. I'm absolutely not. What I'm arguing is that as a basic foundation for calling this stuff evidence, you have to be constructing an argument in a particular way, and you have to tick certain boxes. I can't say that 'blue fish are evidence of unies', because I: i) haven't defined an unie, and ii) haven't shown how they are evidence of unies, as in, the mechanism for this. I'm not worried about the Genesis story or Augustine, or so on. I've taken your claim of sin on the metaphorical/didactic level at face value, and my criticisms are against that formulation.   I do, however, believe that we can take our own experience, as well as the body of scientific knowledge, and compare that evidence to religious claims and reinforce our faith in those lessons (which we usually do not comprehend deeply at first reading.)   Just a small observation. Science is a method, not the conclusions, and without the method the observations fail. Your method here directly and absolutely contradicts and rubbishes the method observed in the sciences. That's more of a problem than people generally recognise.   The proposition is that our ancestors have sinned and we pay the price for that fall from grace. By simply observing history, or the effects of our behavior on those around us, we can see that this claim is true.    The problems here are really too many to comment, but I'll remark on some important ones. This is not really a proposition, it's an interpretation. You're trying to provide evidence for it, but the 'evidence' itself relies on intangible and unproven assertions. Most importantly, the 'evidence' is not evidence for the proposition, but collections of facts that you're interpreting in a particular way, based on your interpretation, to fit that interpretation. That's a different thing. It's also not just an interpretation, but a belief. You're not talking about premises here, you're talking about conclusions, and working back to justify them. You can play the game you're playing with any belief. Try the belief 'Jews run the world'. Think in the same terms that you're thinking. It's quite easy to rationalise the world into a way that supports the belief that you hold there. That's not evidence though, nor are the collections of facts that you can assemble to apparently support this belief evidence.  Truth time here:   We share some of the same tools of investigation, but we apply them differently.    I see no evidence of this. We're not using the same tools at all. In fact, even our mindsets are radically different.   Your brand of analysis is critical to revealing historical truth, but it takes a more abstract approach to reveal spiritual truth. These are entirely different spheres of study.   I don't consider my field (let's say the scientific enterprise in general) to be limited in the way that you consider it to be. I also don't consider anything beyond that which this field is able to consider or examine to be the subject of valid study. (No, I don't think Theology is an academic subject, or Divinity for that matter, and yes, I support the separation of them from subjects of genuine study in terms of academic qualifications.) I absolutely do not buy Stephen Jay Gould's non-overlapping magisteria theory. In fact, I think it's complete nonsense. I also don't claim spiritual authority or use religious types of terms when they're absolutely not appropriate. I think that the use of terms like 'evidence' is not only inappropriate and inaccurate, but it's actively dishonest. It's an attempt to claim secular authority for a religious process."

If a sole piece of evidence, or a sole tradition, even if it's eyewitness testimony (which these aren't) attests to an event or thing which is otherwise precluded for some other reason (e.g. strong evidence to the contrary, or general implausibility), then we don't consider it evidence for the thing being real. In the first place, anyway, we would only consider it being evidence of that person probably thinking they observed (in one way or another) that thing. So, when we read a story of a Greek digging up ten foot bones of humans (and there are eye-witness accounts of this), do we see that as evidence for ten foot humans? No. We see it as evidence that the Greeks thought they were observing ten foot humans. (In reality, it was almost certainly dinosaur bones).   With the Bible it's even more convoluted. None are eyewitness accounts, so they're strictly only evidence of a tradition anyway. As historians we're mostly interested in traditions these days, rather than 'hard facts', but it's still worth observing that no, they don't qualify as evidence of this stuff happening. This is just the way the historical process works, and it's why (to be a snob for a moment) professional-level academic history is hard, and it requires a high level of qualifications, intelligence of a certain kind, and training."

I understand that that is the only evidence you accept however, the word does not simply change meaning based on your opinion.  There are many kinds evidence and some such as personal experience is not convincing when shared with others.  It is up to the individual to weigh the evidence and come to their own conclusions.  Actually you can't stop them or yourself from doing this automatically.  To say you don't see any evidence for gods simply means that there is no evidence that you find conclusive.

If you like, consider it a fallacy to claim that it adds anything at all to our evidence. The evidence from Herodotus doesn't mean that it is not the case that there are gold-digging ants (that would be a sort of fallacy of fallacies), it just doesn't offer us any support for the proposition that there are. I'm not saying here that evidence has to be sufficiently strong to be counted as evidence. I'm saying that the story of Herodotus' gold-digging ants is evidence for many things, but it is not evidence for gold-digging ants actually having existed.

Then add in thousands of personal testimony and thousands more of personal experience, then you have, or at least I would submit that you have, evidence of something occuring that requires serious investigation.  by themselves, yes personal experience etc is poor evidence (justification if you want to call it that) but taken with everything else they become part of a bigger more substantial piece."

Another example - and I'll pick a tough one to avoid the low-hanging fruit. Thousands of people have written or spoken about experiences seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. Would we, as historians, deem this evidence of the afterlife? No. We might consider it evidence of an underlying cross-cultural cognitive visualisation (as it, in fact, is), or perhaps evidence of the influence of a common Representation, or so on. Why is it evidence of these things? We can observe the process that leads to those, and it doesn't contradict other evidence that we have about the way that the world works.   personal experience etc is poor evidence (justification if you want to call it that) but taken with everything else they become part of a bigger more substantial piece.   Leaving aside the above discourse on what it is evidence for, weak evidence does not become stronger by a multitude of it. Again, that's not the way the historical method works.

DebateReligion,3dxpmt,HighPriestofShiloh,4,Mon Jul 20 15:51:42 2015 UTC,"surely this means you have already judged the topic the evidence is for as being not worthy and are weighting the evidence accordingly. Evidence is by itself nuetral. It shouldnt matter what it is for surely?   No, that's not at all what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that history is a difficult and complex thing to do, and things don't always (in fact, they often don't) mean what people who aren't academic historians think they mean. So, let's go back to Herodotus and his giant gold-digging ants (inc. flying snakes). What we do when we look at that passage (Hdt 3.105-7):   So when the Indians come to the place with their sacks, they fill these with the sand and drive back as fast as possible; for the ants at once scent them out, the Persians say, and give chase. They say nothing is equal to them for speed, so that unless the Indians have a headstart while the ants were gathering, not one of them would get away. [2] They cut loose the male trace-camels, which are slower than the females, as they begin to lag, one at a time; the mares never tire, for they remember the young that they have left. Such is the tale. Most of the gold (say the Persians) is got in this way by the Indians; they dig some from mines in their country, too, but it is less abundant. [106] The most outlying nations of the world have somehow drawn the finest things as their lot, exactly as Greece has drawn the possession of far the best seasons. [2] As I have lately said, India lies at the world's most distant eastern limit; and in India all living creatures four-footed and flying are much bigger than those of other lands, except the horses, which are smaller than the Median horses called Nesaean; moreover, the gold there, whether dug from the earth or brought down by rivers or got as I have described, is very abundant. [3] There, too, wool more beautiful and excellent than the wool of sheep grows on wild trees; these trees supply the Indians with clothing. [107] Again, Arabia is the most distant to the south of all inhabited countries: and this is the only country which produces frankincense and myrrh and casia and cinnamon and gum-mastich. All these except myrrh are difficult for the Arabians to get. [2] They gather frankincense by burning that storax1 which Phoenicians carry to Hellas; they burn this and so get the frankincense; for the spice-bearing trees are guarded by small winged snakes of varied color, many around each tree; these are the snakes that attack Egypt. Nothing except the smoke of storax will drive them away from the trees.   ... is examine what the passage means in a broader sense. So, we know that until Alexander the Great the Greeks knew next to nothing concrete about India. This is fascinating, therefore, not as evidence of a species of ant that we've never before encountered, but as evidence of a process of mythologising of alterity. It's interesting for students of Herodotean ethnography, and students of Herodotean narratology and historiography. The lack of corroborating evidence (contemporary or ancient), the understanding that Herodotus (or, really, any Greek of the period) cannot be expected to be a reliable witness to actual existing things in India, and the corroborating evidence for this as tying into other themes in the text, suggesting many alternate and themselves sufficient justifications and interpretations - this all means that no, we don't take this text as evidence for gold-digging ants. For similar reasons we don't take the biblical tradition as historical evidence for God existing or Jesus' supernatural acts.   Lay history is different and put simply, lay historians generally don't understand the intricacies of this method. (Would we expect them to understand the intricacies of quantum physics?) In this case we find articles like this one that talk about finding the 'real' gold-digging ants. Seeing something like this, a Herodotean historian is going to do the intellectual equivalent of a face-palm."

A fair criticism, I suppose, though it is out of context. There are a few related defences I can mount that make this a different ball-game:   History, as a field, does not make any assumptions beyond the sciences. It is fundamentally naturalistic, as I said, but that's a consequence of its place as a science. It is not trying to prove anything, nor does it have a horse in any race. There is no proposition that is sacred in history, even including the influence of culture at all on human action. Historians have methods. I'm not saying that Theologians don't, but history certainly shouldn't contain any apologetics of any kind, any special pleading, or any inappropriately held beliefs articulated in our work. We have methods that subject each thing to the same criteria, and that's how we judge them. We also have a bottom-up rather than a top down method. We look at stuff and decide what it tells us (a rational process) rather than looking at stuff, and explaining how it supports a particular belief, or looking at stuff to find out what it tells us about a belief (a rationalising process). We're not engaged in judging each thing by its relation to another set of propositions, like Theology. We're not talking about bald interpretation here, or subjective readings. We're talking about a specific method that takes at least seven years of undergraduate and post-graduate learning to master. In the same sort of way that a + 1 does not equal 2, it's easy to understand why people might make that mistake, but we can likewise preclude such readings. This is sort of similar to philosophy, too: think about the 'genetic fallacy'. You can see how people would make the assumption that the right interpretation of a word (for instance) depends upon its original meaning, but we can observe how this does not follow. It's about method.    I would not read the passage you quoted as fact, I would be looking at possible underlying truths in it, such as ""so that unless the Indians have a headstart while the ants were gathering, not one of them would get away"" making me wonder if heroditus had ever seen a lion and been mistakenly told they were indian ants. All of which tells me I would make a horrible historian.   That doesn't mean you would be a horrible historian. Most of us, indeed, are not interested in facts. Usually it's not necessary to say something is actually wrong, or not supported. We just don't talk about the reality of the gold-digging ants, because it's neither interesting or supported. Personally, I don't think Herodotus invented the story - there are other things that would lead us to believe that. As a result, predicting the origins of particular 'mistakes' isn't really a game we can play, because we don't know anything much about the tradition of this idea or how long it was floating around in Greece before Herodotus wrote down this particular iteration."

But if their evidence is real, then God clearly is interacting with the universe, somehow. And if he is interacting and some ways, I don't know how you can say with such certainty that he might not ever interact in other ways. For instance, you also mentioned religious texts, but in those kinds of texts God is literally interacting with the universe in very direct ways; he interacts in measurable ways in the Bible, and that is very much amenable to scientific inquiry, as best I can tell."

It isn't charitable to define a religious term-of-art according to a lay understanding of it, which is what's implied in appealing to the majority of theists.  We have every reason to suspect fundamentalists have their idea of faith as wrong as their biblical hermeneutics.  I don't think the classical ideas about faith line up with your definition. ""Blind faith"" is often discussed as a distinct notion from faith.  Blind faith is faith without/in spite of the evidence.  Thus, if religious thought has a distinct concept for illogical belief, then faith, being distinct from that concept, can't be the same thing.  Thus, whatever we infer ""faith"" means from religious discourse, it isn't belief against evidence.  See also fideism being a distinct position from its (considerably more popular) alternatives."
DebateReligion,3dxpmt,platoandfriends,3,Mon Jul 20 14:09:22 2015 UTC,"I think you are right in that the fact that ""blind faith"" exists as a term implies that there is ""non-blind find"" as well.  I think both sides disagree on what is considered evidence.  From the atheist perspective there is little or no evidence of God's existence or hand in the world, therefore all religious faith is considered blind faith.  From the theist perspective they believe that good things that happen are evidence of blessings and bad things that happen are trials.  They believe these things are evidence at least for themselves and so they don't consider their faith blind.  An important distinction however is that while faith does not technically imply evidence or a lack thereof, faith does imply a lack of knowledge.  Faith is hope and trust, but it is not a source of knowledge.  Once something becomes knowledge it has left the realms of faith forever.  I do not have faith that my cell phone is sitting on my desk right now.  I do not have faith that it gets dark when the sun goes down.  Theists may not mean ""belief against evidence"" but I can understand why many atheists/agnostics would see it that way.

Clifford writes in The Ethics of Belief that authority is permissible if we would expect that the authority is trustworthy and would know the fact that we are trusting their authority on. Thus, the Christian can justifiably generally take the teachings of the Church as beliefs without having to know more than that the Church teaches them.   I just want to understand what evidence is being used.  It isn't evolution.  It's no genesis being read literally..."

This completely ignores the Orthodox Jewish perspective that all the laws are to be morally kept and that there is not any distinction between though shalt not murder and though shalt not mix plant fibers and animal fibers in your clothing.

DebateReligion,3dyn57,Morning-coffe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:10:41 2015 UTC,"""Salvation"" as a term used by Paul in the New Testament does not mean a guaranteed golden ticket to the rapture, it means inclusion into the congregation of the saved, meaning the church.   Paul in his letters was referring to the concept of being among the ""children of God"", when before it was an exclusive club that you basically had to be born into, being of a tribal membership, like he said of himself, a ""Jew of the tribe of Benjamin"".  So Paul was saying that this source of pride and feeling of automatic righteousness is counted by him now as worthless in light of the new thing, ""the righteousness of Jesus"", which makes the old thing of just following the letter seem rather dim in comparison.  Paul says that the Law is good in that it points out what is sin, but the Law itself is powerless to make a sinner righteous, and to achieve that, it requires faith in Jesus because it is through him acting as intermediary, we receive the spirit from God that brings us into alignment with a higher type of righteousness that comes from a change of heart from within.   Paul taught that only by becoming dead to the Law can one live the Christian life (Galatians 2.19, 4.21, 5.1, 18).6   In Gal. 2:19, Paul was talking about his fellow Jews and the situation they find themselves in as apostles of Christ among the gentiles, just being physically with them who do not follow the Law, which in itself would make them ""lawbreakers"", so he is saying that if we lose our ""Jew"" status as viewed by non-Christian Jews, then that is just one of those things and we died to our Jewishness for the sake of the righteousness of telling the world about Jesus.  In Gal. 4:21, Paul is talking about gentiles who were accepting the gospel of the Messiah, which by the way comes from the concept of the ""King of the Jews"", so regular Jews, seeing gentiles believing that they were under the lordship of a King of the Jews, felt it their duty to teach them that they should show proper regard to the institutional Jewish leadership (the same group who crucified Jesus).  So Paul is speaking to them that they are not really Jews, so much as really a newer and better thing which is what goes along with the apocalyptic age that we are in as the promised messiah has been revealed to the world as Jesus, ushering in the global ingathering to those gaining the righteousness of God that comes with following him.   Galatians 5:1 is Paul taking a stand on circumcision as an indication of if someone is following the gospel or are following the religious establishment of the Jews who are telling the gentile Christian converts that God will not accept them unless they are circumcised.  The argument Paul uses is that if they accept that based solely on it being in the Torah, then they would be forced to accept everything in it, including rituals that have been canceled by the actions that Jesus carried out which made him the virtual High Priest who is our intercessor between man and God, and not the temple priests offering sacrifices on the altar.  Galatians 5:18 is Paul saying, ""But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.""  Which is explained by the earlier part of the passage, "". . . walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.""  In this section of Galatians, Paul seems to be using the word, Law, by another one of its definitions which means something like ""judgment and condemnation and punishment"".  So he is saying if we are led by that spirit we will not fall into behavior that will separate us from God and that spirit that comes from Him."

I'm working on why we care about the law of Moses if we are not bound by it. From my perspective, the Mosaic law was the perfect law for the place and time that they found themselves in. This law was based on how the virtues of God would be expressed in that time and place.   For example, if God was writing a similar law now, he might include say speed limits. However, speed limits in the time and place that they found them selves in don't really make sense. They only really start to make sense when you have fast cars like today. However, the underlying principle of the law (I should not endanger others) and the virtues that it represents has not changed. Similarly, the dietary laws were a very rough version of what we would come to know today as the FDA. The rule against mixing two types of cloth seems nonsensical to us now, however, if you look at the cultural context that they were in, in essence what it translates to (roughly) is ""Don't impersonate an authority.""  To give an analogy, let's say I want to be a cubist painter. Then I'm going to study how someone like Pablo Picasso used shapes in his paintings. How the shapes he used corresponded to the subjects of his paintings. I'm going to take the principles that Picasso used for the shapes and then apply them to my own different subjects.  In a similar way, I want to have the same character as God has. Therefore, I'm going to study how God's virtues apply down through the ages. I'm going to look for how I can take the virtues and apply them to the circumstances I find myself in today.  TLDR; Christians care about the Mosaic Law because it helps to reveal to us the virtues that we should be striving to embody."

Saying 4 quarters = $1 doesn't define either term and doesn't say anything about how much either is worth. So saying God is good or good is God, actually means nothing until you define God or good in a non circular way. Just like a dollar doesn't mean anything until you actually know what a dollar could buy you.

I think the problem here is that if you start to nail down a real definition of morals (like basing it in well being and suffering) it would be hard to claim that the God depicted in various religious texts is indeed good.

You are just assuming that God is good. Your argument goes both ways. If You cannot see everything he can see, how do you know what he did was not the most evil decision?  But even the phrasing ""morally justified decision"" is contradicting your own position. As it would imply that God is trying to follow some standard of good and needs to justify his actions. If is God the definition of good, he doesn't need a justification, whatever he does (no matter how evil it would look) would be good by definition. Even if his actions leads to the worst possible suffering, it would be good by definition.  This all comes down to the Euthyphro dilemma: Is an action good because God commands it or does he command it because it is good? The former makes ""good"" arbitrary and the latter means good is independent of God.   What is your Definition of morality? Where does what God does fail to match that definition?   I think morality is about the consequences actions have on humans. As suffering and well being in humans are real things, not dependent on what a God has to say about it. If you want to claim that God in his wisdom can see the perfect moral system that would improve well being and reduce suffering, that I would say is at least an argument.

To address your example, the concept of ""homosexuality"" would be foreign to the writers of Deuteronomy. On the other hand, they accepted very intimate relationships between men or women (so long as they had no open sexual contact). Being ""gay"" or ""bisexual"" is something that people who are so would realize later on in life and they would only distinguish themselves since they know of the label.   The sexual purity laws for every person regardless of orientation, were placed because in the ancient world, sex was something that was commonly abused or used to abuse people. Also, STD(s) was something that cannot be cured as easily in the Bronze Ages."

DebateReligion,3dx4qp,peter-son-of-john,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:49:47 2015 UTC,"Ok, but this still doesn't give us the result of YHWH being a consequentialist. Surely he can have all the characteristics mentioned prior, but still embrace the categorical imperative or eudaimonic ethics."
DebateReligion,3dx4qp,deathpigeonx,2,Mon Jul 20 15:51:23 2015 UTC,"...categorical imperative...   I just read through this quickly, but it seems to apply to humans with very human concerns. The reply of YHWH in the book of Job actually remove the ""human-centric"" line of thought by evoking the beauty of creation.   ...eudaimonic ethics...   This also seems very human.   Though, I just read the wiki page of both moral philosophies so I might be wrong. I am proposing that the only one virtue of YHWH is for something ""to be"". Living beings are a consequence of the absolute laws of nature, but we are probably not the entire point of things."
DebateReligion,3dx4qp,peter-son-of-john,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"But my problem isn't with specific philosophies that you've rejected, but with the unwarranted jump you made from being bound by absolute truth, not being omnimax, and being bound by cause and effect (possibly including knowledge of all possible moves) to being a consequentialist. None of that seems to imply consequences being seen as equivalent to the good. You need extra premises in there."
DebateReligion,3dx4qp,deathpigeonx,2,Mon Jul 20 17:02:17 2015 UTC,"Being bound by absolute truth was the core of Proverbs 8. It's like this:   YHWH has one virtue - for something to exist. That is the sole measure of good. Therefore, any action done is for the sake of something to exist.   The consequences of the actions of YHWH should always result into maintaining a continued existence. I added the premise of one virtue in my previous comment."
DebateReligion,3dx4qp,peter-son-of-john,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:40:28 2015 UTC,"This seems like it could easily imply a deontological framework along the lines of Kant's ideas of autonomy, that is it is your duty to not cause something to cease to exist. In this way, your ethical framework examines the action as to whether or not you are ending a life rather than looking at the aggregate consequences. So, with this deontological framework, one wouldn't be able to kill someone if it would save three lives, while the consequentialist framing of this one would be able to do this. As such, I think there needs to be greater refinement to you premises to get the conclusion you desire."

DebateReligion,3dyt4i,dvirpick,2,Mon Jul 20 17:26:47 2015 UTC,"a cruel and oppressive ruler   I wouldn't go with that definition.  Go with    An absolute ruler   You can be a tyrant without being cruel or oppressive (well you can if you define that word to be that flexible, its just a word after all).  Its just that most tyrants in the past have been cruel or oppressive so that title is derogatory.     I (an atheist) would actually love being ruled by a super intelligent benevolent dictator.    For example I could imagine some future civilization that successfully creates a benevolent AI that is utilized to govern the whole of society.    Its a very scary gamble to create such an AI because you have to be sure that you program it correctly on the first go, once given access or control you will never be able to stop it.    So then question then becomes is God benevolent?   Most organized religions believe in a benevolent dictator.  God is the tyrant but thats not necessarily a bad thing.  However your point is sound.  Lets assume there is a god and he is ruling our universe, I think it is important to accurately assess the being, not because we can potentially usurp God if he turns out to be a bad guy, but if we discover that he is in fact a bad guy we can still do our best to play his game to better our (and others) situation.     If God really exists and really is an asshole and solely for his own amusement desires that everyone wear a green hat on Wednesdays, then I think it wise to investigate what the consequence of not wearing that green hat is and if bad persuade as many individuals to wear the green hat and create a society that has so many fail safes that everyone will have access to green hats every Wednesday."

DebateReligion,3dyt4i,qmechan,2,Mon Jul 20 20:03:10 2015 UTC,"God creates everything that is not himself from nothing.  That means that there are only two kinds of things, God and not God; God and stuff God makes.  Any standard of goodness you care to apply to him must therefore be either God himself or something God made.  Either way, God defines goodness.  The idea that we can somehow get outside of him to evaluate him is the lie we bought from the serpent.  There is nothing outside of him so we are profoundly incompetent to judge him."

For one, there is no unifying political thesis in Quakerism, and so a government of Quakers would be more or less like any other government. Also, Quakers are dedicated to a level of tolerance and respect for others that is rarely equaled in any other religion. Judaism makes many claims in this direction, but is fundamentally more insular and therefore tends to develop a view toward non-Jews which is not conducive to, e.g., running their government for them.  I could see Neo Pagans, but only because they are so fractured that a Neo Pagan theocracy would not have any one central theology to base its mandates on."

For example, there might be one or more states in the US where all members of the state Congress are Christians, but nominally that is not a requirement for being a member of the government, so while it might have theocracy-like features, it's not a theocracy.  But while Rome was run in a very secular way as compared to many other governments of its era, no one was allowed to be a part of that governance who was not a member of the state religion (I know, it's cheating when the state religion is syncretist, but history is messy) and so it was technically a theocracy.  There are also hybrids. Japan and the UK are theocratic monarchies with a secular democracy running the day-to-day operations."

Not only completely vegetarian, they even exclude onions, potatoes and a number of other vegetables from their diet. They go on the extreme end with their pacifism, like wearing cloth over your mouth to not accidentally breath in and kill insects and such. Also pacifism is not always good, if a neighboring country is trying to conquer you, the last thing you want is Jainists in power.  Personally, I'd go with Buddhism. Just like Jainism, it lacks (or at least has less) of the dogma, holy wars and punishment fetishism of the Abrahamic religions, while at the same time not being too restrictive on the followers."

That puts you in the hot seat to defend that position.  Again, this is a debate forum, not an informal lounge.   How would Jains handle this that and the other? Presumably the same way they did when their popularity was at its peak and there were entire societies of Jains. Or if you really want to know, go do some reading and ask Jains about it, because I'm not one.   Being that you nominated the Jains as your theocracy of choice, I would assume you'd have some informed reasons as to why you'd pick it over another.  You say you'd get your head cut off if you say the wrong thing under the Jewish or Islamic society, but as far as this religious Jew is aware, there is no capital punishment against blaspheming God.  And again, the link I provided shows how difficult it is to ever be on the receiving end of the death penalty.  You read the link, right?   Or if you really want to know, go do some reading and ask Jains about it, because I'm not one.   I wish one would post on here so I could.  I would also hope that one speaking on their behalf had a knowledgeable opinion.  As far as I see it, you don't have an informed opinion on the Jains or any other religious law, so your answer seems rather poor.   I'm just an atheist answering a question for which there was no good answer or answer I feel is much worth defending, since I'd sooner go to war, fight, kill, and die than I would live under a theocracy.   Well, I guess there's no need for more discourse after this.  You might as well not participate in the sub if you're not going to actually try at discussion.  I'm sure /r/atheism will happily welcome your lackadaisical participation.     Dunno. As far as either go though I'd definitely feel safer speaking out among Jains than in a theocracy based on any middle eastern madness. Honestly your cows are a much lower concern for me than getting my head cut off by bloodthirsty savages over things I say.   So you're saying you're more likely to speak ill in public than to ever engage in business transactions and interact with your fellow people?  Seems childish.  Don't you work for a living?"

I have no reason to lie and many people here would be willing to attest that I'll share unpleasant things about Judaism if they're true.  Deuteronomy and Leviticus are not the be all end all of Jewish law.  There's the 5000+ pages of the Talmud which has elucidated into other branches of law.  Granted I have not learned it all (and it will probably be many years until I do), but there are many sources online to give insight into the details as well as the many more commentaries that exist on top of them.    And you still have yet to provide any insights into why Jainism is a superior alternative.

I've gone back though, seen what you mean, and there's a lot more ways to die than just blaspheming that I'd have to be worried about under a Jewish theocracy.   It seems like you missed the forest in the trees.  Read the amount of jurisprudence that one needs to go through to reach a guilty verdict.  It's basically impossible.  Here, I'll save you the difficulty.   It requires two witnesses who observed the crime. The accused would have been given a chance and if repeated the same crime or any other it would lead to a death sentence. If witnesses had been caught lying about the crime they would be executed. Two witnesses were required. Acceptability was limited to: Adult Jewish men who were known to keep the commandments, knew the written and oral law, and had legitimate professions; The witnesses had to see each other at the time of the sin; The witnesses had to be able to speak clearly, without any speech impediment or hearing deficit (to ensure that the warning and the response were done); The witnesses could not be related to each other or to the accused. The witnesses had to see each other, and both of them had to give a warning (hatra'ah) to the person that the sin they were about to commit was a capital offense; This warning had to be delivered within seconds of the performance of the sin (in the time it took to say, ""Peace unto you, my Rabbi and my Master""); In the same amount of time, the person about to sin had to: Respond that s/he was familiar with the punishment, but they were going to sin anyway; AND Begin to commit the sin/crime; The Beth Din had to examine each witness separately; and if even one point of their evidence was contradictory - even if a very minor point, such as eye color - the evidence was considered contradictory and the evidence was not heeded; The Beth Din had to consist of minimally 23 judges; The majority could not be a simple majority - the split verdict that would allow conviction had to be at least 13 to 11 in favor of conviction; If the Beth Din arrived at a unanimous verdict of guilty, the person was let go - the idea being that if no judge could find anything exculpatory about the accused, there was something wrong with the court. The witnesses were appointed by the court to be the executioners.   As a result, convictions for capital offense were rare in Judaism.   And what's inside of it is a bunch of different ways for me to die.   If you can get convicted to death in a system of law like what's above, then you probably deserve it.  Otherwise, I think you'll live a long life.   Who says there wouldn't be any? I just think that with Jains there'd be less. I'd fully expect to be hauled off and put away for theft or murder in a Jain society, but don't suspect they'd react the same way for eating potatoes, onions, or meat.

However, I truthfully believe that even if I wasn't Jewish and I did a comparison between Jewish law and Shariah law, I would feel that I would be more free living and have less reason to fear the court system in dictating a punishment in a Jewish theocracy.   Perhaps that is true, but wouldn't you really rather live without fear of a judge trying to use theology to interpret evidence against you in a courtroom, and trying to reach theologically sound verdicts over what to do with you if you're found guilty?

DebateReligion,3dv4bv,ShakaUVM,3,Sun Jul 19 20:00:40 2015 UTC,"There are very serious differences. First, the judge in a theocracy is necessarily going to be someone who believes he knows God's will and commandments better than you, or for whatever reason is willing to pretend he believes that. Second, if he is a true believer, his own immortal soul is on the line; expect no leniency from a judge who believes God's written commands are to be obeyed to the letter. In denying God's justice, he'd believe he's condemning himself. Third, unless the religion involves adhering to scientific forensic methodologies in determining guilt, you're looking at a legal system that puts far more stock in witness testimony than in things like physical evidence. Finally, I know of no religions that have appeals processes in their legal codes. You don't want to live in a society where you can't appeal a guilty verdict.  I rest my case, pun intended."
DebateReligion,3dv4bv,EndiaBanana,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:25:34 2015 UTC,"good point, though it depends on the situation, if the theocracy is based on the common interpretation of the scripture (so if you have a homogeneous religion that is universally accepted in that theocracy) then it would be as interpret-able as the written law of modern/western nations. the positive of course to someone being convinced by true judgement of a god means it is less likely to be a conflict of interest (a false judge). and to witness accounts, in western judicial systems there is also a very strong dependency on witnesses testimony, usually physical evidence is not conclusive enough to come to a viable verdict. Also, lots of religions have either a hierarchy  with several bodies on which one could appeal, or it has an elected leadership which can be repealed by whomever it was elected. i don't think theocratic justice would necessarily eliminate the possibility of appeal.  i would appeal a reaction (also pun intended )"

What you're describing here is a strange situation in which all members of a society share the same interpretation of their religious doctrines. I don't think this has ever happened at any point in history, and I'm not even sure it's logically possible. Pretty much any system of laws could work if all members of a society agreed to abide by them and they aren't physically impossible. But the very fact that we're talking about law breakers here means we're already accepting a priori that in any theocracy we can imagine, there would be disagreements about what the law is, whether one should follow the law, and how best to interpret it. So I think we can throw the idea of universal acceptance out the window.   and to witness accounts, in western judicial systems there is also a very strong dependency on witnesses testimony, usually physical evidence is not conclusive enough to come to a viable verdict.   But witness testimony all by itself doesn't carry nearly the weight of witness testimony backed by physical and forensic evidence. If my neighbor says he saw me cut down his tree, but there's no evidence I did, it's his word against mine in a secular court of law. If there's video evidence placing me there, it's an entirely different matter.  In contrast, if I recall correctly, Islam only has rules in its judicial system for accepting testimony, not physical evidence. If my neighbor managed to get two of his buddies to testify against me, too, an Islamic court might convict me regardless of whether there's any physical evidence or not.   Also, lots of religions have either a hierarchy with several bodies on which one could appeal, or it has an elected leadership which can be repealed by whomever it was elected. i don't think theocratic justice would necessarily eliminate the possibility of appeal.

Those judicial bodies may exist out of tradition, but I don't know of any religious text that lays out a hierarchy of courts and appeals.   The Catholic Church has a system of priest bishops and pope etc, they form a hierarchy, so one is judge presumably by local priest first, then appeal may be done to bishop and then pope (there are more steps, but this is for example). this would be the same as the system of local court and supreme court etc."

DebateReligion,3dv4bv,Sickeboy,6,Mon Jul 20 04:50:39 2015 UTC,"Mahayana Buddhist. I say mahayana specifically because it is the school of Buddhism that teaches that even laypeople can achieve enlightenment, and don't need to be a monk in order to accept the teachings of Buddha and live a life consistent with Buddhist teachings, so such a society would probably encourage people to live life as they see fit as long as they were kind to others.   Although I disagree with their beliefs regarding the supernatural (I am ignostic), they are not in any instance I've seen anti-science. Their morality isn't based off of dogmatic moral statements in the way that, for example, Christianity is (stone a woman for not being a virgin on her wedding night, for example), but on a moral framework which can lend itself to a humanistic morality and seeks to limit the suffering of others where possible.   Mahayana Buddhists also believe, as I understand it, that there is no ""soul"" and that accepting this leads to enlightenment, that selflessness is a virtue, and that material attachment is (by some accounts) at least one of the ultimate causes of human suffering. One can easily see how a society with beliefs like this would be far less selfish, more empathetic, more liberal, more live and let live and more conducive to intellectualism than other theocracies might be.   EDIT: Also, props on the original question. It's certainly thought provoking and revealing."

Despite the crazy religious fundamentalists that live here in the US, and the amount of political power they hold, I'm happy to live in a country with separation of church and state and I wouldn't want it any other way because ultimately, religion can and will be shunned from government. However, the question is what religion I would choose if I had to live in a theocracy. And apart from maybe folk shintoism (which I'd arguably be equally as okay with as a mahayana Buddhist theocracy, which is to say I'll take what I can get), if you can count that as a religion, that's about as mild as it gets in principle.   I'm certainly not arguing that a Buddhist theocracy would be all roses, just that comparatively speaking, it has more potential to be tolerable, compared to theocracies like Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia for example."

When Christians have moral beliefs that fall in line with being kind, it is because of particular moral statements in the Bible like ""love thy neighbor"" that just happen to be a kind thing to do. The entire moral framework of the Bible is not kindness, it is God's law. And God's law also includes stoning women for not being virgins on their wedding night. Christians who believe in the former and not the latter, do so because their own internal moral compass tells them that that's the right thing to do, rather than buying into the prescripted morality of the Bible.    there are of course reasons most Christians don't stone people, it mostly has to do with the idea that only God gets to judge, forgiveness, redemption etc.   No, it has to do with the fact that humans have an internal moral compass unless they're a psychopath, and we use that compass to naturally filter out the horrible bullshit in the Bible where it may be found. Also this is definitely not consistent among Christians, see: American conservatives, who are often homophobic, racist, slut shaming, and some of the most judgmental people on the planet.   this is not what i meant, what i meant is that there would have to be some kind of consensus, and in theocracy (I'd think) this consensus has to be based on religious convictions.

In Theravadan I have never heard of lay people not being able to achieve Nirvana. What you may be confusing is the idea of how to get there or what you do. Theravadan believe that if you're able to become enlightened then go for it. Mahayana believe that you should become a Bodhisattva and get right to the cusp but don't leave yet so you can come back and help. I actually sort of agree with the Mahayana view more but Theravada seems to be less mystic which I agree with more. In the end saying ""Oh I'm Mahayana or Theravada"" is silly. Same with saying ""Oh I'm Buddhist"". Labels are dumb. We should say we follow the Dhamma.

I forget where theravada buddhism falls in all of this, but I'm basing my answer off of admittedly limited knowledge.

Mahayana has in my personal opinion mixed with a lot of stuff from East Asia which can certainly be a good thing as I said I enjoy zen/chan. You are right that Mahayana is more practice based on meditation whereas Theravada uses scripture a lot more. You'll also find that the monastic-lay person divide is much less in Mahayana tradition. That said all three major schools of Buddhism at their core are the same. All require meditation, reading, thinking, acting, viewing. Basically as I've said they are 99% the same.  Oh I know the point of the question is that. I mean I'd love to live in a Buddhist theocracy as if it was perfect it would allow for free practice of all religions or irreligion. That said I have yet to see a perfect government past or present. It really is an interesting concept but people become too attached to their religion. If you have a Buddhist theocracy that is say 100% Buddhist and then eventually 1% become Christian. You'd think ah whatever. Then 10% over the next 60 years. Again whatever.

Actually this isn't true, you have a misunderstanding of what Mahayana is vs Theravada. Both schools teach that one can be a ""Householder"" as well as a monk. And nowhere does anyone say that a Househoulder cannot become enlightened.   Furthermore, Mahayana monks also observe everything that a Theravada monk does. They follow the same set of rules, the Vinaya, and everything. The only difference is that Mahayana has added onto the original teaching that Theravada follows by adding the ideal of the Bodhisattva, and the scriptures related to that.   Here's some interesting thoughts on the matter from the wikipedia article on Mahayana:   Nattier has noted... there is no doctrinal difference between Mahāyāna in this context and the early schools, and that ""Mahāyāna"" referred rather to the rigorous emulation of Gautama Buddha in the path of a bodhisattva seeking to become a fully enlightened buddha.[13]  There is also no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas.  From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.[16]  The Chinese monk Yijing who visited India in the 7th century CE, distinguishes Mahāyāna from Hīnayāna as follows:[17]  ""Both adopt one and the same Vinaya, and they have in common the prohibitions of the five offences, and also the practice of the Four Noble Truths. Those who venerate the bodhisattvas and read the Mahayana sūtras are called the Mahāyānists, while those who do not perform these are called the Hīnayānists."""

But yes, many people have pointed out to me that this belief exists in all schools to varying degrees.   I realize that many Christians don't support that belief, but it is as a matter of fact in the Bible. The fact that Christians don't support it is because they are cherry picking biblical morality based on their own internal moral compass, but that doesn't mean that passage isn't in there and any Christian would be justified in believing it for having been Christian in the first place. It is merely incidental that many Christians do not believe in it. Prescripted morality is dangerous, and sometimes Christians do believe horrible shit just because it's in the Bible.

DebateReligion,3dv4bv,ShakaUVM,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:33:35 2015 UTC,"Let's ignore what's meant by ""less strict"" and ""more easily obtainable"", your initial statement was that Mahayana was unique in the belief that laypersons could obtain enlightenment.   I say mahayana specifically because it is the school of Buddhism that teaches that even laypeople can achieve enlightenment, and don't need to be a monk in order to accept the teachings of Buddha and live a life consistent with Buddhist teachings   There's actually a few things I could say about it, like asking who has told you that Mahayana Buddhists believe you don't need to live life consistently with their own teachings to achieve enlightenment. The thing that I want to point out there is in the bolded bit, you did claim that laypersons achieving enlightenment is a unique character of Mahayana Buddhism.  That's wrong too though, Christians generally divide their understanding of the laws handed down by God in two ways; either it's a moral law and applicable to Christians or a ceremonial law that is no longer applicable because the purpose of the ceremonial law was fulfilled with the coming of the Messiah in the form of Christ. This is why Christians can eat pork and shellfish, or wear clothes of mixed fabrics or crossbreed cattle.  Now you do bring up a good point about ""judgmental Christians"" and justifying their hatred of homosexuals through Leviticus. Paul can be quoted in several places as condemning homosexual sex, which is how Christians know that homosexuality is still regarded as a sin, but the proscribed punishments were part of the ceremonial law and done away with. That being said, Paul also said ""no temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man."" The thing to tell those judgmental Christians is that sin is sin, there is no sin which they're above including homosexuality. Plenty of gay Christians who've chosen celibacy, and while I imagine it's a hard life it's one that's consistent with their faith."

But if you accidentally get some milk on your meat spoon you can always boil the spoon in water.  This also depends on how hot the milk was when it touched the meat spoon because if it is cold it should be okay.  Just boil it anyways incase any milk might have gotten into the pores of the spoon.  In fact you should check with your Rabbi first or if you are really worried just throw the spoon away.  Criticisms aside...

""True AI"" entails the AI having a soul, which of course can't be tested for machines or people.  So regardless of how advanced AI becomes, theists can continue to maintain that it's not ""true AI"". Theists make testable predictions, e.g. <insert ANY testable proposition here>.  If the god claim is unfalsifiable, no test can produce ""evidence against the prediction, and thus against the model"".

But honestly, if I moved into a house where everybody I spoke with believed in god, in a neighborhood where everybody believed in god, and they convinced me to go to church just to try it, who knows, I might convert over time.  If everybody around me believes, I might end up believing myself, over time.  I mean, one of the reasons I'm an atheist is because religion wasn't enforced in my house when I was growing up. We didn't go to church every Sunday or anything like that."

DebateReligion,3dvon3,UnclaimedLight,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:47:30 2015 UTC,"oh definitely, that still happens.  Here's my point though, and I'll be long winded about it, with two examples:  the first one was about a plane crash. In college, our english teacher told us about two planes that collided while they were trying to take off, there were some casualties and lots of injuries. Or maybe one of the planes was landing while the other was trying to take off? In any event, the point is that one student scoffed and said if HE were in that situation, he would have gotten off the plane. Like he's so sure that he would have acted much better than everybody who was actually there.  The second example would be Jews not leaving while they had the chance, during the Holocaust or just before. Lots of people think that if it was them in that situation, well they wouldn't have fallen for it, they would have just up and left before any real trouble began. I find this view to be a bit offensive, in this example.  But the point is, I am not going to claim that I know how I'd react in certain situations. I'm sure, if my parents had been more religious, its very possible that I might be a strict Catholic today.  I think lots of atheists think they are these rational machines, who eat evidence for breakfast and use logic and reason to make all of their decisions. Sure, they make mistakes, they'll admit that. But they won't admit to being stubborn, ever. ""Show me evidence for a god, and i'll convert!"" they say, as if they don't have a single stubborn bone in their body.  Well I am human. Not only do I make mistakes, but I also suffer from being stubborn sometimes. I have biases. Sometimes I might ignore things that seem uncomfortable. I think we would all benefit by admitting to that, and I think too many of us wont.  So if someone asks me why I'm an atheist, my big reason is because it wasn't reinforced during my childhood.  PS: Sorry that my examples were morbid, those were just the ones that came to mind."

DebateReligion,3dvon3,Jaeil,2,Mon Jul 20 19:24:54 2015 UTC,"The way to convert/deconvert to/from any religion is to walk around as if certain tenets are true. Once you get the subjective feeling of those tenets, you lean into that feeling until its colour dyes your psyche. This is the principle that underlies every paradigm shift.  Various methods of reasoning only encourage this process, but it's the process itself that actually affects change in the mind. For instance, a theist might be persuaded into at least considering atheism, and then ""try on"" the idea that there is no God, become acclimatized to that subjective feeling, and then make that their home. Conversely, if a staunch atheist so much as considers there being a God, and feels into that for long enough, and if the feeling is to their liking, then there's a great chance they'll become theistic, or at least a deist or pantheist.  Whatever feeling you love, that becomes your home. This is a principle that will twist reason to conform to it - you can't be truly rational or have a view from nowhere, because bias is inescapable. All reason has an agenda, and that agenda is to confirm the beliefs that give the individual who's reasoning his or her most preferred feelings. Some people subtly prefer feelings of nihilism, for instance, even if at course levels of their mind it seems to harm them, and so their reason will twist and contort itself to verify this mode of feeling. No human is immune to this principle."

Were that to disappear then and all things remain the same besides - death, murder, theft, capitalism, whatever - then I'd probably find it pretty damn hard to even conceive of a god in the first place. Or maybe it'd be easier actually, maybe I'd play the stupid little Christian game like a real bastard. Maybe it's having better ideas within yourself, a sort of righteous indignation, that even lends to the negation of a god. I don't know.  If a god appeared before me though I'd believe in him. Who wouldn't? People can say it's still not logically certain that there's a god yadda yadda, could all just be a hallucination, but that's not going to take from your belief. How many of those people believe in evolution etc. because it's what they're seeing? Double-standards much. And they might say that they don't, but they do. Nobody's really keeping the spark of solipsism alive deep down inside them, that shit would be torturous. So...  It's meeting god versus something like the entirety of humanity turning around to me and showing me that every last one of my actions has been predicted until now, that they've all been running some grand experiment on me, pretty much completely negating my agency, nobody can really judge me out there, all of it was meaningless robotics, they could make me do fucking anything. But then I'd probably think of humanity as something like a god, so... Theism/atheism.  People generally go with what their senses tell them. And everyone believes in some sort of god too.

Even so, since on orthodox teaching Christ's human nature is perfect and this his intellect is not darkened by sin, the theologians in the tradition have often also said that Christ's human mind is different than the imperfect ones we possess.

CS Lewis writes in his book ""the screwtape letters"" that Jesus didn't teach anything new, he just taught what countless prophets and moral leaders had taught before. and that it was not something new that needs to be taught, but indeed the morality which is known for ages, which apparently need to be taught over and over again, because we keep straying from it.   I wonder if he new all languages or was he only familiar with the tongues of those he only came to save.   Common Christian teaching is that Jesus came to save everyone.  further i don't think it necessary for Jesus to have had to known all languages, he acted in the land of Israel and spoke its language. Speaking of many different languages, is an occurring event in the bible, Pentecost springs to mind, this however is not used to teach people moral law but to spread the news of Jesus death and resurrection and all that come with that.  as for the main question, all-knowing, i don't think so, he was wholly human (also wholly God but its complicated) so he was limited by physical human properties: he could die, he hurt, he felt emotions, he ate, he slept, he worked and he rested. the main difference of Jesus (in life) and other humans is that he did not sin.  he was very intelligent, one of the earliest stories of Jesus' life is him discussing Jewish scriptures with the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem, when he was 12. he is also often referred to as rabbi, which i learned means teacher, and he seems to have a very intimate knowledge of Jewish scripture, either due to him being the son of God or just because he learned them when he was young, it really isn't that relevant i think."

The Spirit enters ""into"" Jesus at his baptism (the same moment at which Jesus is adopted as God's ""son"") ""drives him into the wilderness,"" and provides the power by which Jesus heals. This Spirit then abandons him on the cross.  There is no Trinitarian theology anywhere in the Bible, and the authors of the Gospels don't even seem to know that Jesus and God are supposed to be the same thing."

Even in Philippians 2:5-11, Paul writes that Jesus ""emptied Himself"" of the qualities of God in order to become a man, so I'm guessing that Jesus was not omnipotent or omniscient while on Earth.
