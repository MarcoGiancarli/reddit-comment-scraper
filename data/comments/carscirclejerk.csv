carscirclejerk,3donv9,aaquafina,5,Sat Jul 18 00:06:21 2015 UTC,"Ok. I see a few problems in your post. Firstly, that is not a miata. That is an automatic, lifeless, hairdresser car. Now you may be new around here, but i gotta let you know that i did downvote you for stating that you wished to test drive an automatic car. Im not sure if that was a typo, but either way it was simply uncalled for. I suggest you test drive it, and crash it into a building.  Second, there is absolutely no reason for you to be buying a new car. You can purchase a turbo miata with an ls1 diesel swap for less than 2 grand.  I am simply appalled by the nerve of you op. Next time think before you post."

Now wait! don't call me crazy, let me explain. I've studied the biology of BMWs a lot. BMWs can operate perfectly for almost a year without an engine.  You are not gonna need this car after a year.

carscirclejerk,3dety9,sbstnb,5,Wed Jul 15 18:42:22 2015 UTC,"Bro. Even if you could why would you want to? Let me list all the reasons why a BMW is a bitch car.  1.) Not a Miata. Bro why would you even drive something that wasn't a miata or AT LEAST a subaru, like a true enthsiast?  2.) No LSx? Might as well not even fucking try. God only built 1 motor and it has pushrods.  3.) Not AWD. I mean yeah, BMW has X drive but that's for bitches. True enthusiasts understand that only Subaru knows how to make a real AWD.  4.) Not enough known faults. So what if you have to replace the entire cooling system every 75-100k miles? Everyone knows that once your car gets over 50k miles, it's pretty worthless. Buy something with a boxer engine so you can fix that shit every 10,000 miles, like a true enthusiast.   5.) The only reason to buy a german car is to get a diesel manual wagon, the cars that rarely come into the US because the enlightened Europeans know that us 'murikans cant handle a car with true soul like that. So why would you waste your time on a german car that doesn't even have a real diesel soul?"

carscirclejerk,3ahjs5,tjandearl,2,Sat Jun 20 21:16:24 2015 UTC,BMW E30 or an old 80's rabbit or golf.  You're going to want an 80's car in that price range just due to the cost of parts now.  A 1990s $3000 german car will be a massive headache.  I can't think of many cars that would be decently reliable that hit a price that low other than the three I listed with decent parts available as well.  The mercs and audis tend to be more from that era.

Basically ford bought Aston because, despite making awesome cars they were in financial straits.  Mostly due to the fact that they borrowed very few parts from other vehicles and the cars were hand made (like by panel beaters).  So ford dressed up the Fusion platform so that there were some shared body and suspension / platform components with the new luxury platform.  When ford picked up Aston they were only producing about 700 cars a year...

carscirclejerk,2w6dh0,Dr201,3,Tue Feb 17 14:16:31 2015 UTC,"I started with a manual Corolla. I thought it was enjoyable, but more work at first, so I eventually got a car I had been lusting over, a MKIV GTI, I know, probably one of the worst ones. To make it even worse I settled for an early, 4 speed auto because I didn't know any better. After that I took time to really study everything I could about cars, finally sold it and got a BMW 135i. . .DCT. Again I settled, this time I let people convince me that an automated manual was ""the best of both worlds."" That dual clutch is probably one the best DCT trannies short of exotics and 6 figure cars. The shift times are incredible, but I honestly just don't care. It's nothing like the enjoyment of really feeling the car and rowing through the gears. So I'm selling that to buy a BRZ. I think I'll take all of your advice and hold on to that car for as long as I can."

You can find a decent turbo kit on ebay for around $400 which is a ton easier and cheaper than buying one from a trusted source. It should do 0-60 in about 1.5 seconds and with the third row seating you can seat 8.

carscirclejerk,1894iz,DLfreak,4,Mon Feb 11 01:54:28 2013 UTC,pfft thats nothing.  i swapped my stock 86 into the Dodge Viper

carscirclejerk,1881uu,BimmerAddict,3,Sun Feb 10 01:27:13 2013 UTC,Infused with a LS1 FRS Miata edition

carscirclejerk,1881uu,DarkLF,3,Sun Feb 10 02:29:18 2013 UTC,Mine is the FR-S. The BRZ is just too Subaru-y.
carscirclejerk,1881uu,coolcool23,5,Mon Feb 11 06:05:43 2013 UTC,GTR = 4wd Toyota Landcruiser = 4wd  therefore landcruiser = gtr

carscirclejerk,1881uu,DarkLF,5,Sun Feb 10 02:30:17 2013 UTC,Dis gud jerkin
carscirclejerk,1881uu,Sufficient_Retort,3,Sun Feb 10 03:01:03 2013 UTC,"Srsly? The gtr only gets good lap times because of computers, that's why I got a miata. Turn off all the driver aids and I bet my miata could lap any circuit faster."
carscirclejerk,186gue,BimmerAddict,5,Sat Feb 9 05:27:15 2013 UTC,as a legit fr-s miata owner i approve this.
