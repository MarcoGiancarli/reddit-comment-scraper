The best fractal based algorithm I know of utilised in OnOne Perfect Resize Pro 7.0.1 only achieves this as a result, which is orders of magnitude worse than what you linked. Looking at your version, it actually features detail and sharpness that aren't even visible in the pixiv sized version."

But you'll get triple reddit gold if I get my hands on that upscale software presuming it exists, which I'm sure it doesn't, but still. My guess is that artist uploaded the full sized version elsewhere or is selling the access to the full sized version, and Waifu2x has that access somehow."

Patchuu,347wry,Henry132,2,Wed Apr 29 08:16:34 2015 UTC,"I could be nitpicking, but it would be great it OP also used awwni.me or minus to upload the images as imgur tends to compress and make the image ugly."
Patchuu,347wry,Patchuu,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:24:12 2015 UTC,"This picture is literally the same quality as the original. I think you are mistaking something, or your current setup is not loading imgur pictures properly?"
Patchuu,347wry,Henry132,3,Wed Apr 29 13:48:47 2015 UTC,"No no, I wasn't saying this particular image is any lower quality, but it very often happens that imgur uploads are compressed. As far as I know, that happens when they go over 2MB in size. This one was just under 2MB.  EDIT: There's a tiiiiiny bit of compression after all. The imgur version is 1,90MB and the original is 1,95MB. In this case the difference is miniscule and not noticeable at all, but for any larger images the compression will be greater and the quality deteriorates a great amount."
Patchuu,347wry,Patchuu,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:56:30 2015 UTC,"As long as people regulate themselves and use it appropriately, I'm okay.  The rule is already, ""best quality version"", so as long as it is, I don't really care where it is hosted."

There is a tab that says 'link flair templates', clicking that will allow you to edit the default text in link flair (e.g., 'source anime'); make sure you click 'user can edit' and save!

I also wanted to break the traditional style of post by having something very American with something very cute.As a bonus here is some rare monster truck footage of an event held at the Tokyo Dome.
