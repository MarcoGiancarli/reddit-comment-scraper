ArchitecturePorn,3dsenf,arbili,10,Sun Jul 19 00:25:40 2015 UTC,"There was a documentary about the construction of this building. I saw it years ago. My memory is that the building was incredibly hard to build, it baffled the construction teams and stretched the limits of the engineers and steel manufacturers.

ArchitecturePorn,3dsenf,mirthful-buddha,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:47:55 2015 UTC,Hate? I said I disliked it. Am I not allowed to criticise architecture? I disagree. I think it's this ugly. Semi detached housing? What on earth are you on about? I never said I think everyone should live in a semi detached house. I never said there shouldn't be multi story offices in London. You're putting words into my mouth here.
ArchitecturePorn,3dsenf,Duke0fWellington,2,Sun Jul 19 20:51:41 2015 UTC,"True I did put words in your mouth a bit, but surely you can't dislike the entirety of London's skyline? I mean it's kind of ridiculous that they waited so long to start building skyscrapers but at least they have the benefit of a wealth of skyscraper building to learn from. The tall buildings I've seen in London are especially nice compared to most other large cities. And I'd argue that a good mix of modern high rises with old architecture can make for a more enjoyable view. As much as I think the CN tower in Toronto could be better, it is still a defining landmark and it wouldn't be the same without it. And it's a concrete radio tower for crying out loud, I'd love to have the Shard or other London towers over it any day."
ArchitecturePorn,3dsenf,mirthful-buddha,0,Sun Jul 19 21:14:25 2015 UTC,"No, I don't. I just think whoever is in charge made a terrible idea by not following the Paris and Moscow method, by building these financial sky scrapers closer to the outskirts of London, not in the middle blocking the views of all the historic buildings and what not. Paris is wonderful, you can see everything from the eiffel tower. If they built sky scrapers in the city centre you couldn't see a thing from there. Thank God they chose to build their financial centre on the outside. Wish London had done the same."
ArchitecturePorn,3dsenf,Duke0fWellington,2,Sun Jul 19 22:46:33 2015 UTC,"I've been to Paris, I love the Eiffel tower and the Louvre but everything else is run down and dirty. I mean the old stuff, so in their case I think they were too stubborn in denying new buildings. Not to mention their skyscrapers are butt ugly compared to London's. If you want to be able to enjoy the old buildings, which are prohibitively expensive to maintain, you have to sacrifice something. And that might mean more tourists or traffic, which means higher density in those areas. Or greater public transit, but London chose to build high density in its city center and I think they are smart to do so. It brings money in to those specific districts which help pay for the upkeep of those buildings you hold so dear."

ArchitecturePorn,3d4w8g,Dr_Gage,2,Mon Jul 13 20:45:47 2015 UTC,"Mostly because of his persona, he's a diva, very eccentric and likes to do and say stupid shit. In an interview on national TV he once said that his wife and kids knew they came second in his life and he had told them.   On the design part most of my architects friends don't speak well of them(if I remember correctly A-cero is a partnership between him and another architect), I can't really remember any specifics but the main idea is that i'ts very unoriginal and sort of repetitive.   I personally like the style, I think they over do it a little, but it's nice. I've seen the construction of one of them and it looked a little too much for my taste, but I can definitely see why people like it. This one, they are selling it now, if you have 12 million euros to spare and want to come live in my beautiful country it's your chance now!"

If only I had that kind of change :P  I can definitely agree it's repetitive, but I really like the style A-Cero puts forward (probably more than any other modern design group), so I see that as a good thing. I wish they were more favored amongst the rest of the architecture community, but I'm also inspired to find that the style I've loved for year could be considered ""unoriginal""; the more examples of similar structures the better!"

Acoustic beauty is a subjective and contextual experience.    But they do have four very versatile spaces, and they can create different acoustic environments depending on artist or client desires.  EMPAC has a 1200 seat concert hall, a 450 seat theater, a 3500 sq ft black box studio, and another 2500 sq ft black box studio."
ArchitecturePorn,3bw67g,Mr_Abe_Froman,2,Thu Jul 2 22:41:38 2015 UTC,It also has fantastic temperature controls/design so the interior is a constant temperature.
ArchitecturePorn,3bw67g,zakraye,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:57:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm not really even sure what they're trying to say by using the term acoustically perfect.  I personally would view a sound isolated anechoic chamber as ""acoustically perfect"" (or as close as it's gonna get in the practical sense). Then again, I know many people wouldn't want to spend more than a few minutes in one.  It looks like a neat space, but I'm not sure what the message is behind the acoustics."
ArchitecturePorn,3bw67g,GP0537,2,Fri Jul 3 11:54:13 2015 UTC,"EMPAC itself doesn't make any acoustic claims like that.  Their concert hall has a crisp (not muddy, even amplified) 3-4 second reverb that they can send all the way to almost zero with felt banners they drop to cover the walls.  And.. ha, yes, I don't know if your chamber would be appealing to everyone!  Last night I was watching a doc on Netflix about living in Antarctica.  One of the things that was mentioned was how utterly quiet it was there on a day without wind.  When the folks return from there, they need time to adjust to all the noise."
ArchitecturePorn,3bw67g,zakraye,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:16:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was just talking about the post's title ""acoustically perfect"". A three to four second reverb is pretty damn long... although I'm sure in certain instances that sounds interesting.  Yeah, I like my acoustics like I like my humor: bone dry. I do a bit of amateur eletronic music (just like every other person alive nowadays), so my little bedroom studio has acoustic treatment all over the walls. I really do prefer an almost complete lack of reflections. It's probably because I prefer artificial reverb.  Antarctica sounds like my kind of place... All of the videos I've seen on those multi-million (possibly more?) anechoic chambers they use for engineering/scientific research say that people can't stay in them longer than a half an hour or so or they go ""crazy"". I'd like to take that bet. I could probably stay a few days (provided I had bathroom breaks, food etc.). haha I guess I'm a bit weird, but it truly does sound like a fun space to live in, if not utterly impractical."
ArchitecturePorn,3bw67g,youismath,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:47:06 2015 UTC,"Acoustically perfect is entirely dependent on the function of the environment and the ears (or in some cases measurement equipment) doing the listening. There isn't really a perfect color or perfect room for every scenario. This space does a good job of splitting the needs of non-amplified music, as well as the needs of dance and amplified music."

ArchitecturePorn,3bw67g,youismath,3,Fri Jul 3 01:00:43 2015 UTC,I work with the acoustician who was on the design team in charge of making this space sound the way it does (He's currently my boss). Just thought I would share that and answer any acoustics related questions that I can.
ArchitecturePorn,3bw67g,youismath,2,Fri Jul 3 02:48:44 2015 UTC,"Wow, thats amazing. I've always been so curious about sound design and audio engineering, but it is way over my head. What about this venue that stands out from a lot of other venues out there? Is it that it was designed with acoustics in mind?"
ArchitecturePorn,3bw67g,vanshnookenraggen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:58:21 2015 UTC,"The world that I focus in is called Architectural Acoustics. It's a thing. You can actually get a degree in acoustics from this school (RPI), and many others.  Every inch of this space was designed with acoustics in mind. Many modern performance venues have Acoustician on the design team.   Some of the most interesting spaces in the building are the Studio spaces.   The architectural inspiration was the surface of the moon in order to design sound diffusive panels that allow sound energy to live with the space without arriving at listener's ears as harsh, distracting echoes.   The Concert Hall takes its inspiration from Vienna and Tanglewood (beloved 1200 seat halls). It wants to be supportive and inviting to all types of performance (orchestral to dance). Thought was given to both preserving a supportive acoustic response for solo performances and providing great sightlines for dance from any seat in the house.  If there are any more specific questions, I can pass them on to my boss for comment."

I'd imagine Chinese customers would also consider porcelain facades because they are frost resistant, and chemical resistant.  Porcelain as a building material isn't native to China.

ArchitecturePorn,3bmzwq,just_superpics,6,Tue Jun 30 15:04:48 2015 UTC,"Finally! An outlet for my obsessive cataloging of Manhattan buildings!  These are, from left to right, 944 Fifth, 936 Fifth, 930 Fifth, 923 fifth and a little bit of 920 fifth. A little bit about them, this being architecture porn and all:  944 is a sort of Italian Renaissance style condo built in 1925. Frank McCourt, former owner of the Dodgers, broke all sorts of records paying millions for the first floor apartment. The exterior of the building isn't much to write home about, but is nice enough.  936 is a fairly boring art deco set-back number from 1955. You could trip over one of these every few minutes walking around Manhattan.  930 I love. Another Italian Renaissance designed by my favorite New York architect, Emery Roth in 1940. Woody Allen used to live in the penthouse.  923 is a lot like 936. Set-back condo from 1955.   920 is another Renaissance style designed by J.E.R. Carpenter in 1922. It's actually really tasteful and understated, so if you're not fond of the Roth style this one should suit you nicely.   I've gotta disagree with u/blacktoise a little bit, since while the 50's condos are indeed a little blase, the older ones are just lovely and I don't think will ever go out of style."

ArchitecturePorn,3bir72,architravvel,11,Mon Jun 29 15:47:00 2015 UTC,It is a beauty. I definitely prefer Stalin's grand buildings to Hitler's.  I also find them much more attractive than Modernist and Brutalist structures.  If they weren't associated with the biggest mass murderer of modern times the buildings would improve any American city's downtown.

Crockets from a gothic church  Columns from a Greek temple  Tack a clock up high.  Why not Big Ben?  Top it all off with a finial off a Chinese pagoda

ArchitecturePorn,3bir72,vonHindenburg,2,Mon Jun 29 17:35:51 2015 UTC,"It was a Russian attempt to set foot in Europe. Now a little light on the situation:  It is beyond my comprehension why the western hemisphere is giving Russians so much credit, when from the point of view of the occupied European state they are simply savages. Ask Hungarians, Czechs or Poles what was the worst thing to happen to their country, and they will answer in unison: Russians.   Now do you understand the sentiment?"
ArchitecturePorn,3bir72,LMB222,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:37:15 2015 UTC,"It is something that in the history of western Europe and North America was never fully understood nor taught. By time they became the enemy of the west whatever happened in eastern Europe was quickly forgotten. The conflict of two nuclear superpowers became the focus of western and international attention. And the proxy wars that resulted were the distractions. It is well known to me that the Soviets did more irreparable damage to eastern Europe, on the whole, than the Nazi's did. But because the Nazi's were the antagonist, they were the focus of history and as such we do not know as much about crimes or atrocities that the allies committed. As they say, history is written by the victors.  As you say, you can't comprehend why the west gives Russia credit. In my opinion, the west wouldn't give Russia much credit other than serving as a distraction so they could retake positions in the west. Which they did do, however a vast majority in the west has no idea of the extent to which Russia perpetrated mass killings in order to solidify control over its territories. So if the west does give credit, it is in ignorance of events that were largely ignored by the international community, then forgotten in the wake of the decades long Cold War. It is widely understood by academics that Russia did more harm in eastern Europe, however translating that into views and opinions is harder to do as the Nazi regime were the focus of intense propaganda at the time and not Russia so people did not develop the same opinion of Russia in World War II as they did of Nazi Germany. I hope this helps you understand the position of western countries."

ArchitecturePorn,3bir72,Jarkownik,3,Mon Jun 29 20:14:02 2015 UTC,"If we take your logic then we should destroy ancient buildings that were built by every empire the world has ever seen, because they were built through conquest, war, forced labor, etc. When in reality it is a part of history that for better or worse has shaped society into what it is today. To destroy it is to forget what happened, and that is a greater evil than leaving it for future generations to learn from. Preservation is critical to the development of the human race for without it we would be nothing but instinctual, reactionary beings that live for nothing but the present/future."

ArchitecturePorn,3b56e9,Toppo,3,Fri Jun 26 03:02:47 2015 UTC,"""These are the great ancient temples of Karnak, on the edge of the Nile about 450 miles south of Cairo. They were the center of Egyptian religion, built in the imperial city of Thebes, when the Egyptian empire was at its height, the greatest power in the world. This was the New York of its time. The temples were built over a period of 2,000 years, each pharaoh adding his bit, leaving his name in stone, to last forever. Inside the temple domain, there were 65 towns, 433 gardens & orchards, 400,000 animals, and it took 80,000 people just to run the place. Small wonder that centuries afterwards the Greeks and Romans came here and gawked like peasants at a civilisation that made their efforts look like well-dressed mud huts. It still has that effect today. You come here from the great modern cities, full of the immense power of modern technology at your finger tips, press a button, turn a switch.

Hilariously tacky aesthetics notwithstanding, the design is objectively bad for a whole bunch of reasons.   It's enormously over-scaled. I've seen good-sized hotels that were smaller than this. This guy will have to entertain a lot to get his money's worth. Considering it's situated in Florida, the stagnant moat is a mosquito breeding ground. If those surrounding trees are deciduous, I sure hope the owner likes leaf fishing, otherwise the moat may actually become part of the Everglades It would cost a fortune to heat and cool due to its poor surface area to floor area ratio I hope the owner doesn't plan on spending much time in the SW and SE corners of the house, they are going to fry in summer (their windows are exposed to full sun pretty much all day) The lighting bill is going to be pretty large too if the owner plans on spending much time in the middle of the house... come on, not even one skylight? Where are you supposed to park your car/s if you don't want them to be blasted by the sun all day? Granted, the current owner might not care that much about it, but this house is currently on the market. I doubt there would be many people who could afford a ~$10m house that wouldn't have nice cars and want to at least do the bare minimum to look after them   That's only what's apparent from this photo, there could be a whole host of other design flaws."

ArchitecturePorn,3a1fqr,Christian_EG,12,Tue Jun 16 14:05:36 2015 UTC,"Beware: Very long (and informative) text about the TRUTH of Santiago Calatrava. ENJOY.  The photo is beautiful indeed, but as many of Calatrava's works this whole complex is full of defects, repairs and botched jobs.  Take for example the building in the back. That's the Queen Sofía Palace of the Arts. It's horrible. A few years back, the whole façade started to crumble down (Originally it was suposed to have a white tile cover like the one in the lower part of the photo all over the outside) Hundreds of thousands of euros were invested just to quit the tile cover, and letting the structure exposed, as we can see in the image above (The grey part) - Here are some photos of the process: This is why it was taken down And here are some photos of the work being done  (1) (2) (3) (4).  And that's not all. The building in the front, called L'Hemisferic it's supposed to be able to open the crystal ""eyelids"" on the lower part, to look like an eye. Well, a couple of years after it was opened, they stopped working and never were repaired.  Moving onto the building next to these two, The Palace of the sciences Prince Felipe. That's full of water leaks, so when it rains, the workers have to put buckets to recover the water. Also, the exterior maintenance is kinda poor, some parts show rust and others have been very poorly repaired.   And did you think that was all? NOPE.   Keep walking a few hundred meters ahead. You'll find something called Agora. Supposed to look like this and since it was a few millions over-budget, it ended up looking like this. A building also filled with leaks, and windows that can't stand a windstorm  That's just a peak of Calatrava's work on one city. Over the course of less than 2 miles. Poor. Over-budgeted and Hard to maintain.   I wonder why so many cities still hire him to do works that could be done way better with less money. I can't imagine what could happen to some of his recent works like the WTC Transportation Hub, or the chappel in the WTC complex, both designed by this man. Seeing his history, nothing good... for sure.  Sorry for the huge text, but you need to know that the man who does some of the most complex buildings in the world, is a scammer. Who is now on trial for receiving nearly 15 MILLION euros for making JUST the mock-ups of three towers supposed to be built next to this very same complex. I'm starting to get angry just by remembering what this man has done to my community. Debts. Unfinished buildings. Corruption...   But you have to give him at least one (little) thing... His buildings look spectacular on photos. That's for sure. No wonder why films like Tomorrowland were filmed here...  Source of all of this: I'm spaniard, living next to Valencia."

In my experience, I've not seen it used for much except for pictures to go on the front of their prospectus and as an area to martial people for events.   On a tangent, the view from out front of the building, out and over the city, is pretty spectacular. I can't find an image of exactly what I mean, but this is kind of illustrative.  I also like the view of the university building from the river, looking past the city's new arena (second busiest in the world). Not exactly the picture I was thinking off, again, but illustrative The new arena is the one on the right, with the armadillo (Clyde Auditorium),  to the left.

A look from National Geographic  Gaudí's obsessive relationship with capturing spiritual ascension realistically   One of many depictions of biblical passages  While it was of course an effort at originality I think the kind of trading style for a show-off aesthetic really didn't come to be until decades late as the groundbreaking was in 1882.

Compared to Gaudi's other stuff it feels like it needed an editor or something to hone the direction. Barcelona's actual Cathedral delivers the usual mix of spirituality and authority that Gothic did so well.  Gaudi's is more fun, I guess. And Europe's positively lousy with Cathedrals and Barcelona's isn't really that memorable, although I think it's got really small buttresses and a truly gorgeous cloister if I remember correctly.  I wonder if the Catholic church would move the Cathedra. Do they do that? They're trying to be all hip and fun with this new wimpy hippie love-instead-of-indulgences-and-sacrament Pope, but this monstrosity isn't exactly his style. Too decadent. The last Pope who looked like Palpatine was the one who was into art. I for one think Catholicism should be old and stuffy and oppressive and the Sagrada Familia would seem tacky for such an institution."

You can access the observatory from the museum's elevator, but you can't get to the top. You can notice hexagon-shaped openings near the top, that's where the observatory is. Here's the inside of the tower near the top, when you get off the elevator."

ArchitecturePorn,383j5w,mrdommyg,2,Mon Jun 1 21:23:30 2015 UTC,Is the castle named for the town or is the town named for the castle?
ArchitecturePorn,383j5w,DictatorDan,6,Tue Jun 2 03:25:25 2015 UTC,"The castle has had the Himeji name since the 16th century. It started as a fort on a hill called Himeyama, meaning I think ""Princess Mountain""; it was then reconstructed as Himeji, ""Princess Road"", so possibly these names only reflect local place names. The castle was the feudal seat of the Harima Province which made up the western part of what is now Hyogo Prefecture. It is possible, especially if there was a road, that there was a town or village called Himeji already there and the presence of the lordly seat gave it prominence (think of Versailles, for a parallel example in Europe) but I've found no confirmation of this. Himeji City was only officially established in 1889, after the end of the feudal period.  After the feudal period many Japanese castles were torn down in a modernizing fervor, many by the military, and Himeji Castle was only saved by the intervention of a local officer (I have no idea why, but that's the story.) The castle was later sold to a peasant for what is today a little more than $2000. He intended to tear it down and develop the land, but the demolition was too expensive and the castle was again spared by chance. It was only protected in 1931, by which point it was basically a ruin. This actually helped save it; many other remaining castles were used as headquarters by local army commanders and bombed during the last days of WW2 (others of course burned with their cities.) Himeji City was heavily bombed but the empty castle was spared. Renovation was only begun in the 50s, by which point it was not only one of the greatest examples of Japanese castle architecture but also one of only a very few original castles left, the others being much smaller and often remote.  All this is to say that it might be unlikely that Himeji City would be consciously named after a castle that no one cared about. I think the city that had grown up around the feudal seat had already come through tradition to be named the same as the castle, or the same places that had given the castle its name had stuck to the city. That being said the castle totally dominates the city, which is otherwise a dull and mostly featureless dormitory town, which most visitors never see. So it might as well be named after the castle.  tl;dr: It might be neither but more likely the latter. If someone knows better I'd love to learn for sure."

ArchitecturePorn,37uzqu,ToasterOnWheels,1 point,Sat May 30 20:01:10 2015 UTC,"Well, it was, in a way, the very last true gothic cathedral to be completed.  Half finished when  the Reformation broke out, funds to finish the building dried up and it sat incomplete (and with a medieval crane sticking out of one of the towers) until the late 19th century.  It was only after the German unification that money was found to finishe the structure.  For the most part, the original plans were followed, but modern iron and steel framing was also incorporated to give it some of its awesomeness.    After visiting dozens of churches and cathedrals throughout the former Holy Roman Empire and Germany, I can say that this is the most German church ever built.  Alles in ordung!  The same exact window and arch is repeated around the entire perimeter, with only a minor alteration being made for the curved walls of the ambulatory."

ArchitecturePorn,36qtz1,thecritic06,2,Thu May 21 20:41:21 2015 UTC,"The spire is of course there to make the building taller, but it does also house functional spaces. Because of the tapered design of the building, the floor plans at the highest levels are too small to be useful for habitable purposes so those levels house technical equipment, like cooling plant, water tanks, and other mechanical plant. The very top has broadcasting equipment."

There's another building in that neighborhood built at the same time that resembles a boat with a modearn twist. I think I remember that post office was built as a part of a larger development that included housing and shopping. Knowing the spirit of that time I imagine the designer pictured the post office like a modern cathedral, centering the contemporary community. There are also some secular sculptures (also with an art-deco flavor) that borrow religious tone in that area. Of course it may have no more meaning than it looks awesome and is creative."

The original from 1862–1863 was torn down in the 1950s. The new beacon stands in the same place, is the same colour (it is painted white) and is the same size as the original beacon. In fact, it is large enough for us to have been able to make use of the interior as a conference venue. It even has a panoramic window out towards the sea. The building holds 60 seated and 140 mingling guests and provides a fantastic view through the panoramic window when the ferries pass by outside."" (source)"

I'm not a very superstitious person, but holy shit there was bad vibes just emanating from this place.  I checked my focus. Did my best to level the camera in complete darkness, and clicked my remote to start the exposure. I used my headlamp to lightpaint the building, and the moment the light hit it, the wind gusted really strongly and caused all the huge trees to groan sickeningly.

ArchitecturePorn,362hdl,fernguts,12,Fri May 15 18:43:58 2015 UTC,"That's ""technically"" wrong on both accounts.  The bridge was reconstructed using the original materials pulled from the river. All the saved material was 3D scanned, assembled virtually as giant puzzle to figure out which part fit where, tested for reusability and reused. It was hand assembled using original techniques by specialists in restauration of buildings of that period. Chemical analysis was done to determine which quarry was used hundreds of years ago for the material and the rest was sourced from there.  Don't recall the final percentage but iirc its over 80% or 85% original pieces.  Also, the river is NOT a divider as Bosniaks live on both banks of the river and the virtual non-existant divide would be further west if you wanted to call it out."

Then a black and white filter at around 30% opacity to desaturate the colours. I also used the b&w filter to darken the lows and brighten the highs. Then a birghtness/contrast filter To increase contrast and darken the image. I used photoshop but I'm sure this is all possible in lightroom.
