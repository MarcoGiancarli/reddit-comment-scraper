mountandblade,3e2o3c,MegaPaladin,37,Tue Jul 21 14:19:48 2015 UTC,"This idea was given to me by /u/abHowitzer. He said I should try to split the fiefs up like in Crusader Kings, which duchies, counties, and baronies.   I redrew the kingdom borders to make them look a bit nicer, and I drew the duchy borders. I then had the idea of putting the flags of the ruling lords over each of the duchies.  I couldn't find any high-res flags, so I remade the flags in higher resolution as best I could and put them over the duchies."
mountandblade,3e2o3c,abHowitzer,23,Tue Jul 21 14:24:08 2015 UTC,"Holy shit dude! This is amazing. Heraldic flags are an awesome touch! Man, this makes me long for a Mount&Blade mod for Crusader Kings."

mountandblade,3e2o3c,abHowitzer,14,Tue Jul 21 15:22:11 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Maybe with Horse Lords now, they could fill in the blank space in between counties with nomadic lands. A village as a county with a tribal holding, a castle as a county with a castle holding and a city as a county with a special city/castle holding."

mountandblade,3e2o3c,Duke0fWellington,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:31 2015 UTC,"I suggested one in /r/crusaderkings a while back but no one was keen on it. Said post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/3bznjn/   With only six different kingdoms, any alliance or war between kingdoms would have a big affect on the player. A lot of the things already exist, basic map design, county names, factions, names of kings, dukes and counts, cultures etc. The Sarranids would be muslim, Khergits golden hoard/Tengri I guess, Nords would be Norse/Norse Pagan, Swadians German/catholic, and then have the Rhodocks Italian and either be catholic for realism, or orthodox for balance. Vaegirs would either be Slavic pagan, or Orthodox if the Rhodocks are catholic.  I think this mod would be interesting, especially for M&B players. The fact the map would be small and have less kingdoms means that one could probably finish a game by reuniting all the kingdoms into the Calradic Empire in a day."
mountandblade,3e2o3c,Windyplains,3,Tue Jul 21 19:07:16 2015 UTC,"And now you have the basis for beginning your own mod within Warband.  Splitting the factions into duchies.

mountandblade,3e36dy,chialeux,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:35:45 2015 UTC,"Many free fan modpacks are much, much better. It just feels too amateurish to be an official paying expansion. Obviously other game franchise do it all the time but I have higher expectations from M&B. Also it removes more from the base game than it adds (less unit upgrade levels, less variety of troops and itemps, a single piece of music - yes the one from the trailer) the map feels empty in many areas, the places and people's names are too confusing to keep up, and after a few hours into the main campain the naval combat and ship travelling only are hindrances, not boni to the game. It may be woth it on sale if you are an intense player but just do not expect too much out of it. Maybe my expectations were just too high. Note: I only tried the main campain, it is possible that standard unscripted games or multiplayer could be more fun. Just dont over-hype it."

mountandblade,3e3rpa,TrotsTwats,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:54 2015 UTC,"Since having a variety of food increases your party morale the code attempts to eat a little of everything.  It does, however, move through foods from top to bottom, left to right.  So if you have cheese in your inventory then some of it will be consumed.  Since you're not using a mod like Lav's Trade Goods that make cheaper and more expensive versions of goods then you can't hide an expensive item below a cheap one.  You can keep one item of cheese near the top left of your inventory while keeping the ones you want to maintain untouched for trading near the bottom right though.  Beyond this you would need to move into modded territory where you have other options for storing foods like within companion inventories."

If that is checked then goto shadows turn it to low and maybe turn off Anti-aliasing. Edit What version did you download? If you only downloaded the current version you may have to go back and download the older versions and slowly put them together and then add the current version to the old versions.

Marshall is a temp position and being a Lady isn't much of a setback to the determined. How about Peasant, Tradesmen, Merchant, Professional, Scholar, Knight (+Squires! I want a Podrick!), Earl, Baron, Duke, Prince, King, with different honors and offices for each, like in Total War. Lord Chief Justice, Lord of the Exchequer, Minister of War, etc. Honorifics and other titles too. Different potential political systems, like the workings of a Quasi-republic, a theocracy, a elective monarchy, a decentralized feudal monarchy, a centralized absolute monarchy, etc.  Unique hierarchical systems to each faction. Maybe the Khergit predecessor is more of a meritocracy, the Nords (Sturgeons?) more egalitarian, the Empire a clusterfuck, the Rhodoks more democratic. Making your choice of faction matter more.   *More organized campaigns. Far too dispersed now. It would speed up late game if you could win you campaign, in effect, with a great battle between all the lords of both factions because they were both travelling all together searching for a field to their advantage. It would make winning against slanted odds even more heroic and meaningfull if it truly vanquished the enemy  Killable Lords! and Ladies! Equal opportunity mass murder!  *More nuanced relationship factors. Fear, respect, admiration, etc. Not just negative and positive. Someone could be deep into negative but shit themselves at my approach (even if he has a slight advantage), or charge headlong at me in a fury because I had his family hanged and he has a vendetta against me, even if hes at a disadvantage.

Criminal activities, smuggling, illegal slaving, narcotics - high risk, high reward jobs for dishonourable characters.  More interactive sieges, catapults and destroyable buildings and so on.

So unless you're on horseback, where every point of reach you can get is very useful (Long Arming Sword ftw), I'd go for the extra damage one."
mountandblade,3e2s0n,Halfkroon,2,Tue Jul 21 15:48:35 2015 UTC,I would agree with this assessment.  +4 damage is much more impacting than +2 speed/+3 reach.  Game modifiers like the power strike skill or weapon proficiency will improve damage by a %.  Only weapon proficiency will improve on speed.  Nothing builds on reach.
mountandblade,3e2s0n,Windyplains,5,Tue Jul 21 20:34:44 2015 UTC,"If you're fighting on horseback, take the sword with extra reach.  If you're on foot, try them both out and see which one you prefer."

mountandblade,3e2s0n,Soyuz_,2,Tue Jul 21 16:16:47 2015 UTC,I always do speed over damage.  I find myself constantly in fights 5 vs 1 where the extra speed of a weapon is often what saves me.
mountandblade,3e2ahi,Myshaak,3,Tue Jul 21 12:13:57 2015 UTC,The module system in Warband doesn't use Python for modding.  It uses it's own proprietary scripting language.  Python is just used to compile that scripting language's files into the module's text files afterwards.  As I recall they said Bannerlord's module system will be using C#.
mountandblade,3e2ahi,Windyplains,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:32:49 2015 UTC,"I see. I don't know Python and I saw it mentioned on the forums, so I assumed the scripts are written in it.  C# would be brilliant, I like that one a lot!"
mountandblade,3e2ahi,thearn4,3,Tue Jul 21 15:03:26 2015 UTC,"Just a side note, Python is a fairly quick language to pick up, even without any programming experience, with a fairly broad set of common use cases at a variety of scales. /r/learnpython has a lot of resources to offer, if you're interested."
mountandblade,3e2ahi,Windyplains,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:01 2015 UTC,This is a very common misunderstanding.  Since the M&B scripting language didn't really have a name (I think we voted on MSscript or something) folks often use the python name in referencing it.  Having most of the tutorials speak first about setting python up to compile on their computers certainly had me thinking the same as well.
mountandblade,3e2ahi,Windyplains,2,Tue Jul 21 16:32:09 2015 UTC,"Just a quick question regardning scripting, is it possible to test / debug scripts on the fly, in game? In some console, perhaps? I wouldn't want to restart the game each time I realise I made a typo in the code somewhere..."
mountandblade,3e2ahi,thearn4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:13:16 2015 UTC,"There is no IDE for modding in Warband.  You have to compile and run the game each time.  There are things you can do to make that a much quicker process though.  1.) Lav's W.R.E.C.K. compiler really speeds the compiling process.  A base native module takes about 20 seconds or so to compile.  Silverstag was up to over 3 minutes with it's added code.  Lav's compiler shrank that down to 18 seconds.  2.) You can remove the starting intro movies.  These are the ""taleworlds_intro.bik"" and ""paradox.bik"" files.  If removed from your main warband folder then they won't play so you'll immediately step into loading the mod.  3.) The main compiler compiles everything at once.  That batch file could be trimmed considerably to compile just troops, items or presentations.  I was doing that before moving on to using Lav's compiler instead."
mountandblade,3e2ahi,sdkegg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:16 2015 UTC,"As an aside, full modding support in Python would be pretty fantastic. Lua or C# aren't bad either, of course. I'm just biased - 90% of my day job is Python programming (scientific/numerical computing)."

To sign up as a mercenary, go up to a lord of the faction in question and ask them for tasks. One of the tasks they will give goes something along the lines of 'As it so happens, I promised (king's name) that I would hire a band of mercenaries for his upcoming campaign'. Just join from there.  If you are already a mercenary, wait until your monthly contract expires, then do not renew it. After becoming free of your contract, go to another faction and join them as a mercenary. This will reset your relations as mentioned above."

mountandblade,3e0fi7,With_My_Hand,14,Tue Jul 21 00:18:56 2015 UTC,"Floris was built as a compilation mod where we put as many OSP (Open Source Project) kits such as music, items, graphic improvements and code in one place and tried to make them all work together.  As a result, it has substantially improved graphics and a wider selection of items.  It's features, while many, do not interact with one another as many were developed independently from the mod by different people.  This is the only real flaw I'd place on that work.  Silverstag has been built more from the ground up, starting with a base native module.  When I started that project, it was with the intent to build each feature custom to the mod and have them heavily interlaced so things felt cohesive.  I think that makes for a more polished code, but as I have worse artistic skills than a third grader, it's artwork is mostly that of the base game.  I kept it's item list considerably smaller so that it would run at a smoother framerate with less resource requirements.  The downside for some is that Silverstag requires the Warband Script Enhancer (WSE) in order to function which means running a third party program to launch Warband because it adds more coding capability for me to develop with.  I could list off probably a hundred differences about the features between the two mods, but each has a wiki that should give you an idea of what they include.  Probably the major differences between the two is that Floris includes the Diplomacy & Freelancer mods.  Silverstag has its own diplomacy system and has a larger focus on combat improvement with troop & player abilities.    Silverstag Wiki & Floris Wiki  Note that the things referred to in the Floris wiki as being slated for 2.6 were never put into Floris.  Instead they were the beginning of the Silverstag mod.  Beyond the above I think players would have to tell you their impressions, but my own biased opinion is that both are awesome in different ways.  I'd try them each and see which is your kind of awesome."
mountandblade,3e0fi7,Windyplains,3,Tue Jul 21 01:23:37 2015 UTC,Is there anyway to play Silverstag without WSE? Any plans to make it playable without it?
mountandblade,3e0fi7,KhetdaNight,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:11:31 2015 UTC,The WSE allows for the use of the new formations which is one of the key features that makes Silverstag so cool.  A play-through without launching from the WSE.exe does not allow for the new formations because they're scripted in with this new extension.
mountandblade,3e0fi7,VikingRayder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:24:45 2015 UTC,"Currently, no.  It will crash without WSE.  I do intend to alter it so that it can run without it, but with certain features disabled in the future."
mountandblade,3e0fi7,Windyplains,6,Tue Jul 21 14:30:20 2015 UTC,"When the team behind Floris separated, Windyplains went on to continue production with Silverstag. It features quite a large host of new mechanics and improvements over Floris, some of which were planned to be included in later versions of the later.  As I understand it, Silverstag is the more advanced of the two and also the most likely to receive updates in the future.    /u/windyplains frequents the Subreddit quite often, I believe he will be able to provide you with a much more detailed answer than myself or anyone else."
mountandblade,3e0fi7,TrotsTwats,3,Tue Jul 21 00:24:30 2015 UTC,"One big difference is the way recruitment works. Silverstag's party building system doesn't work like any other mod or native. Instead, you go to cities and villages and enter a recruitment menu, and you'll receive a list of possible soldiers. Villages only include the first couple of tiers of units, but cities offer every unit available to the faction, as well as all the mercenaries. Elite units (like Vaegir Marksmen and Swadian Knights) aren't available until you are a king, if I'm not mistaken. Units don't level up, either. Well, they do technically, but only into better versions of themselves. They don't level up in the traditional troop tree (i.e. Peasants don't advance to Footmen, they just become better peasants).   This was the biggest difference I saw between Silverstag and other mods (particularly Floris)."
mountandblade,3dzab2,frutjus,10,Mon Jul 20 19:12:38 2015 UTC,"Hello!  What you described is a core feature of my upcoming modules Ranger's Oath and Outlaws.  This system is actually expanded much further than just appointing companions with parties, it allows you to split your army and control both of them independently in a turn-based faction on the world map.  This allows for you to approach combat tactically (bait an enemy with a small patrol, ambush with your main force), allows for you to get supplies if they are needed during sieges, split apart if being pursued, and much more.    Regarding AI-controlled companion parties, these are limited to small patrols appointed by yourself.   As one example, you can order your companion to ride ahead to a location and scout the area. When back, they will report to you on what they saw, any difficulties they had, and where it happened (displayed on the map using tracking).  An experimental feature I am working on is having your companion's patrol become an actual party on the map instead of disappearing for x amount of days. This means if you send them to spread your name for RtR or to get supplies, they become a physical party that can be intercepted or regrouped with at any time.  This is an experimental feature as of right now, I am not sure if it will make it into the final version. Some testers are finding difficulty as their companions are being slaughtered by larger parties occasionally. I hope to find a peaceful balance because having it in the game would greatly improve immersion.    As far as in-battle division commanders, I believe I cover that in the above article as well. You're not able to just appoint companions, you can promote and name any troop within your army to the position of division commander (or just to a companion) once they have achieved enough experience in battle.  The division commanders can either be set to behave with predetermined tactics (archers will retreat to a safe distance and volley fire, cavalry will make passes, etc.) or you can give the commander orders directly and they will micro the troops under them.    If you know any graphic artists, please direct them to me - I really want to set up a ModDB for Ranger's Oath so I can start providing substantial information, but I can't do that nicely without graphics and art to work with.  please please please help me    If anyone has any questions or whatnot, feel free to ask them below (or just wait for the AMA I will be doing soon).   Be sure to vote on which AMA you want the most.    Finally, a quick formatting tip for yourself:   When starting a bulleted list in Markdown, put a break (hit enter an extra time) between the paragraph and your list.  It changes:   Hello, my favorite dessert is: * Ice Cream       Hello, my favorite dessert is:        * Ice Cream    Into   Hello, my favorite dessert is:   Ice Cream   Hello, my favorite dessert is:    * Ice Cream"

mountandblade,3dzere,I-want-margarine,2,Mon Jul 20 19:45:55 2015 UTC,"Yep. Happens to me all the time. Don't remember in what city there's even a pathing or actual scene collision bug where troops will get stuck on the rightmost ladder (from the invaders' point of view), making a bottleneck of death for the invaders. And the AI only takes that ladder if all others are available.  And in all sieges that have walls with stairs on them, the archers will stand by the wall on the ground and look up like idiots. Granted, that makes it easy for the archers to kill any troops trying to charge down the stairs, which will make it easier or harder for you depending what side you're on.  And those huge fucking castles... I swear, I can't stand them. I love Floris for mostly everything else but that annoys me. Yes, they're beautiful. For multiplayer. For singleplayer it's horrid. Invaders charge for half an hour, then get overwhelmed by the enemy reinforcements, then invaders' reinforcements come and it's another half hour of them charging around the scenery.  Tevarin castle I think it is, is the worse. It has horrible pathfinding so the AI gets stuck at the closed gate by the side. Hilariously, they can still hit each other through it. But ugh."
mountandblade,3dzere,Hjaldrgegnir,2,Tue Jul 21 00:22:04 2015 UTC,"Is there anyway of switching back to the native siege scenes?   Tevarin is the pink castle, isn't it? Beautiful scene, but the bots just don't know what the fuck they are doing in it."
mountandblade,3dzere,Hjaldrgegnir,2,Tue Jul 21 01:23:41 2015 UTC,"Not that I know of. Haven't tried the more basic Floris packs but I think it's likely they don't have the updated scenes. Would be great if you could pick which ones you wanted to change.  I don't know if the scenes are somewhere by themselves in the game files, but it's possible. If they are you could go through the risk of overwriting the Floris' scenes with native. But that would probably cause referencing issues I guess."
mountandblade,3dzere,VikingRayder,2,Tue Jul 21 01:33:26 2015 UTC,"Been a while since I was in a siege fight in Floris, but many other mods this happens to me as well.  Best bet is to find the ones that are bugged early on, or go through a cheat playthrough just to find the bugged castles.  Make note of them so in your real save you know not to make that your capital or court! or at least you know not to garrison your troops there and just take it back from the enemy after they take it."

mountandblade,3dxced,microwave_,2,Mon Jul 20 10:19:41 2015 UTC,With these specs it's the game engine itself which is not giving you the utmost performance. Bring on bannerlord already...
mountandblade,3dxced,Poppakrub,5,Mon Jul 20 16:55:11 2015 UTC,"I've never actually tested it, to be honest.  You could try to set up a large battle (or hop on FI2 for one, they're not hard to find there :P), and run some diagnostics on your current build to see what the biggest bottleneck is.  My guess is that Warband's engine has never been optimised for that many entities on the field at the same time, so I think CPU would be the biggest bottleneck. I've seen games handle 10x as much graphical detail without any trouble, so unless Warband's use of a GPU is really inefficient, I don't think that's the bottleneck."
mountandblade,3dxced,Halfkroon,3,Mon Jul 20 11:48:07 2015 UTC,"Here's a non-PC part suggestion that could help.  Using the Warband Script Enhancer can improve performance partly because it has an auto-memory cleaner built into it.  Mods that use it change the way certain opcodes (the commands mods use to code things) to be more efficient.  An example of this would be (try_for_agents) loops.  This is a command that cycles through everyone on the battlefield.  Modders love using these to code in battle effects, but the more people you bring into a scene the more inefficient this loop gets.  Especially when folks decide to do a loop within a loop and have it cycle every second (or less).  WSE provides an alternative there to where it can cycle around only ""agents"" within a small radius of where you want making it much faster.  The end result means a better FPS with the same amount of features, but this obviously only works on mods that take advantage of it."
mountandblade,3dxced,Windyplains,2,Mon Jul 20 14:18:39 2015 UTC,"You might find this thread in the Silverstag forums to be of interest as I'd asked a similar question about performance vs. hardware specs.

mountandblade,3dxced,Windyplains,2,Mon Jul 20 17:13:40 2015 UTC,"The hard drive isn't as important as a good CPU and GPU actually, both of these can also take the place of not having as much RAM, but you'll still need a good amount for big battles.  Depending on your setup, you might also need some good cooling since bigger battles can be intensive on your hardware.  I can't give you the specifics specs to run that, but I can help you build a pc if you need it and we can test it until we find the right settings between big battles and good gameplay.  At minimum I'd say you want 8 GB of RAM, and depending on your graphics settings you could go for a 1 GB GPU, or more. For CPU any decent quad core should work, but do be wary of AMD since they tend to heat up quite a bit. The more power the CPU has, the better, since that will most likely be the biggest issue."

mountandblade,3dxced,xaliber_skyrim,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:26:37 2015 UTC,"I never understood the need for huge battles. While I appreciated it would look cool and be fun, half of the time I run around with my 100~ or so troops owning shit my self as the AI is retarded and walks around with shitty troops also. I used to go with 200~ or so and now with my rig updated after 7 years, I'm aiming for 300. I may end up going back to 200 based on a few things. Sieging a castle/town with 100~ troops while the enemy has 400-500 garrisoned? you're going to have a bad time with higher numbers as the enemy will spawn more troops to shoot at you. Want to engage 6-8 lords that total 600-800 troops with your 100 knights? Again, bad time when they spawn a lot more troops on the field to kill yours."
mountandblade,3dxced,Velderin,3,Mon Jul 20 12:27:11 2015 UTC,a lot more troops on the field to kill yours.   Isn't that the challenge?
mountandblade,3dxced,xaliber_skyrim,2,Mon Jul 20 14:51:58 2015 UTC,"Not to mention a good way to balance and fight fair. No matter how good your troops are, if you are severely outnumbered and don't have the advantage of the ground ala Thermopylae? Being surrounded and torn to pieces is usually how that turns out, not what is essentially a scene from a martial arts flick - dozens of useless henchmen come one at a time, convenient for the hero who, despite all their skill, would be screwed fighting too many at once"
mountandblade,3dxced,Mephistopholees,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:50:16 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. depending on what you scale, having 200~ ranged units defending a siege will slice through you so easily and will force you to bring other lords with you to sieges. As much as I would like to do that, a lot of the issue lies with doing anything with the AI lords. Overall, these scenarios with 500+ or up to 1k troops will just make everything take more time and force you to deal with riding around with lords all the time."
mountandblade,3dxced,Velderin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:56:55 2015 UTC,"As said previously in other comments  Warbands engine can't handle more than a certain number of troops. That's why you have to mod it in the first place to get more than 150  Even if you get the fastest processor known to man, you're still limited by the engine   The engine also needs to be able to take advantage of the processor and eventually stuff like octo core processors are irrelevant because almost all games still can't even utilize quad cores for some reason  If my understanding is correct"
mountandblade,3dxced,Chewiemuse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:16:47 2015 UTC,"CPU is your bottleneck for # of troops. But buying some 12-core processor won't help you since the game doesn't parallelize. I'm not up-to-date on the latest processors, but you'd probably want whichever can overclock the best."

Or a single elimination system such as existed in native?  Silverstag still uses the base tournament system I developed in Floris, but it does have an elimination setting for it to emulate the native design a bit more closely.  Though I think I put that in for Floris as well.  It was some time ago.  You'd find this under the mod's options as ""tournament mode"" which is set to ""performance"" by default.  That might not be what you're looking for exactly, but I'm not aware of a mod that specifically emulates gladiator style combat."
mountandblade,3dy30j,Windyplains,2,Mon Jul 20 14:06:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say yes, your game is essentially over when you die.  Or at least, you get knocked out but the computer dies.  Essentially the same way battles work, only actually inside the tourney itself.    What I'm looking for basically is just the tourney mode on a wider more grander scale, like feeling the roar of the crowd and hearing the cheers (or boos) with every moment."
mountandblade,3dy30j,Wooper160,2,Mon Jul 20 14:11:34 2015 UTC,In the 1200 mod on the Steam workshop there are larger tournaments which happen often. You use your own gear and kill the ai participants. Plus beheading if you hit someone in the neck is fantastic.
mountandblade,3dzt4v,moralguardian,3,Mon Jul 20 21:26:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, so if it's a hostile faction you start with ""disguise and attempt to sneak in"", if your disguise fails you beat up some guards. Then the next dialogue option is to ""take a walk in the streets"". Walk up to the prison guard, tell him you want to see the prisoners, that you want the key now. He shouts something about ""prison break"", you bash his head and now you have his key. Open the prison door.  I think if you knock out all of the guards in addition to the prison guard in this stage that it will just throw you out into another dialogue. Don't knock everyone out, just open the prison door once you have the key."

mountandblade,3dzac4,VikingRayder,3,Mon Jul 20 22:48:58 2015 UTC,"Silverstag is amazing.  Need a script extender which is provided with the mod however to run the mod itself.  Adds in new formations, a better quest layout, better tournaments, better faction recruitment, and better traits.  ACOK - is wonderful because it puts you into the GoT world during the war of the five kings, the detail put into some of the quests and cities is high.  Dev likes to cut out a lot of his good stuff though from each update to update.  Drives me nuts but still fun to play.  Caladria age of Imperialism - Swadian infantry with mustkets.  Adds in new factions as well but same vanilla map which is nice.  Can become an officer off the bat with a regiment of over 60 men.  Siege scenes are broken though and mod still feels very beta but a lot of fun.  Perisino -  New landscape, lots of new armor, equipment, new siege scenes.  But overall very basic, could use more content!  Prophecy of Pendor - New landscape, lots of new armor, equipment, basic siege scenes, but adds in Knightly orders, many different bandit boss quests.  Also adds in achievement system which is a lot of fun.  Has ruling mini quests which allow you to gain or lose renown and favor with your village/town/castle.  a lot of content in this one and a lot of fun.  Be Warned VERY VERY difficult.    Gekokujo -  16th Century Japan, Samurai battles, sieges, and all around epic badassness.  Other than that, basic mount and blade warband gameplay with the freelancer mod thrown in so you can join any lords army and work your way up.  Includes historical figures such as Nobunaga and Yukimara Sanada.    War in the West - Lord of the Rings style mod.  Unlike any other mod out there.  Changes everything, you pick your race and you're on that side for the rest of the game, recruitment is different and you cannot capture towns but can destroy them.  For me, it crashed constantly but was still pretty fun.  Worth a shot.  That's about all I can think of right now. Brytenwalda is out there.  I never got to into it so someone else can fill you in on what that is all about."

Obviously you can't make it too big due to the limitations of the game but I feel its trying to fit the ocean in a teacup and it doesn't scale well. Bannerlord, if the engine power video is anything to go off of, seems to have expanded on this with larger scale maps than they've done before and better tools with which to create and edit maps so you don't get the very unfortunate looking geographical representations you will find in some mods, this being no exception.   tl;dr good concept, too early for proper execution.

Practice makes perfect and it is alot of fun being good at commanding large armies.  If you totally hate it you will know not to accept marshallship next time ;)
mountandblade,3dvqr2,nerdfighting,2,Sun Jul 19 23:56:41 2015 UTC,"Decided to go along with it since you can'y do it. I just set up the archers on a hill close to the enemy and my infantry a couple of steps in front of the archers, then I flank with the cavalry (which is usually 1/3 to 1/2 my army) , make the infantry charge and then the cavalry charge.   I lose ~30-50 units on 500v500 battles (with 400 on screen at a time) and I think that's less than if I let the AI control itself so it seems I can at least play it. TBH I'd rather just control the cavalry but being the marshal just has too many benefits!"
mountandblade,3dvqr2,LvPollar,3,Mon Jul 20 05:56:14 2015 UTC,Thats basically the best thing to do in mount and blade battles

mountandblade,3du819,Sorrowsprite,9,Sun Jul 19 14:56:50 2015 UTC,"Decent enough, but put simply anyone with master Hanamoto gunners are the strongest. or was it Hatamoto, I forget.  Either way, get yourself an army of gunners, take care of the pirate / rebel temples and get free castles that lords attack, stockpile the shit out of elite troops and roll face. Also most difficult to help would be ikko ikki, bastards suck at everything they do."
mountandblade,3du819,Alkazaro,4,Sun Jul 19 17:14:35 2015 UTC,"It's hatamoto. It means ""under the banner"".  Gunners are strong at long range, but Hatamoto Archers shouldn't be underestimated. It's better to have a mix of both. You can have Gunners fire as soon as they can see the enemy, then have archers fire once they get to mid-range distance. Hatamoto Archers will tear through ranks faster than gunners can."
mountandblade,3du819,Niernen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:04:04 2015 UTC,Hatamoto Archers will tear through ranks faster than gunners can.   I just like seeing the cloud of death from my side. But by all means you're correct.
mountandblade,3du819,Alkazaro,4,Mon Jul 20 01:32:05 2015 UTC,"The most difficult to help would probably be a clan without top tier gunners, and with few holdings. I'm going to go with Satomi. Their two top tiers are guards and cavalry, which means no top-tier ranged unit. Remember there's no shield in Gekokujo and horses have 12-14 armor at most so a good gunmen line can easily stop a cavalry charge. Guards are good but alone I'm not sure how much they'll do. You'd have to do with skirmishers and their random items (can be either a bow or a rifle, so you can't really assign them to two different groups like you can with archers and true gunners) They also have one town and two castles, and are near a much bigger clan, although they can face the Satake who are similarly small. And who are the exact opposite troop-wise, with both archers and gunners as their top tier noble units.  Now, if you want to help a claimant and make it hard, you want to do the contrary and do it for one of the biggest clans : Miyoshi or Uesugi are strong clans with a lot of land that they don't lose easily (at least, not without the player's intervention). Miyoshi also has better troops than Uesugi (Guard and Gun) on top of being the only clan (iirc) with three towns.  Source for troop trees"
mountandblade,3du819,Wendek,2,Sun Jul 19 20:17:54 2015 UTC,"For starting a claimant, do I have to my own clan, or do i have to approach them before taking one of the castles also having trouble training people, seems to take forever..."
mountandblade,3du819,Wendek,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:03:33 2015 UTC,"No, to help a claimant it works just as in Native (I suppose) : you find one in a random city (good luck with that - Japan is huge) and then say that you want to take up their cause. You need at least 200 renown for it. When you accept the claimant joins your party and a new faction appears. In Native they're called things like ""Swadian Rebels"". You become ""King/Queen in acting"" of this new faction : you're effectively making every decision, not only on the field as marshall but you also decide who gets which fief.  Also training is superfast once you're high level. My Ukita character (playing as a ""leader"" type character with very high Int but lousy fighting stats and skills) can easily train people from Ji-Samurai to the penultimate tier (Master Gunner) in a few days. To go from Master to Hatamoto, it's harder and they need to earn it on the field. Of course when you start it's not like that, at first you should probably use mostly Ashigarus (peasants), because Ji-Samurais are 300 mon a piece and at low level, they're super frail and easy to kill."

mountandblade,3du819,Wendek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:38:20 2015 UTC,"To be honest... I don't understand why you made this thread about ""how to make the game hardest possible"" and then you're asking advice on how to start the game ?    But to answer anyway : you can either enlist in a lord's army (be sure to take the noble background if you do, else you'll be stuck in the terrible Ashigaru troop tree) or do it like Native and farm bandits. Horse archery is insane in this mod because there's not a single shield. You can circle around bandits forever and level-up very quickly if you're skilled enough. Some people have beaten the game with a 15-strong party with only companions. I've managed to secure myself two towns in such a playthrough, though I'll never have the patience to finish it. Battles obviously take a fuckton longer when you're 15 vs 250. Here's the Taleworlds thread of someone much more skilled than me doing it. With additional handicaps like not being a vassal and thus not getting any fief. Ever."

The basic principal is that what you want to do can't be done by changing a few slots.  The ""base recruit"" is a troop ID # that is saved to a single slot.  You effectively want the base recruit from whatever the original faction is IF you're using culture 7 (player faction from what you've shown).  An ""if"" block (try_begin/end) will be needed at the menu item where a recruit is hired from a village so that if the culture of the faction that owns the village is 7 (you) then the peasant recruit of the original culture should be loaded instead.

For reference, town and castle faction_id is found in the save editor at party_records/(id and name of location)/party/faction_id.

mountandblade,3dr16i,Mr_Billo,11,Sat Jul 18 21:22:29 2015 UTC,"Uxkhal controls three villages: Nomar, Ibiran, and Tahlberl. The border has to encompass those fiefs.  It stops close to the city at the southwestern border because of its close proximity to Vyincourd Castle and Yarangar.   Its southern border follows along a river and the edge of a forest, which are the beginnings of the Rhodok territory.   Its western border also follows along a river and the edge of a different forest. It keeps going north, past another forest and into the mountains.  The northern border is following along the mountain range that separates the Nords and the Swadians.  The eastern border is just where is joins up with the rest of the fiefs."

mountandblade,3duwd9,fang44123,8,Sun Jul 19 18:36:06 2015 UTC,"All of the problems you list are just general mistakes people in MB PvP make.    I have seen so many times where i block in the correct direction of an enemies attack, only to be hit and killed by said attacks anyway   I float around 40 ping as well when I am playing on popular native servers and this simply doesn't happen. It seems you just didn't block in time or weren't precise enough with it and ended up blocking in a different direction.   during a duel i am hit by an opponent, and stuck in a stunned state, unable to do anything while they hit me with impunity, and my character wont block, even if i click and hold the block button in the direction they are attacking in during the stun animation.   The only time you are in a truly ""stunned state"" is if you were ""chambered"" what that means is that they blocked and attacked you at the same time, this is a complicated and risky move but very rewarding to the player if done correctly, two ways to avoid being hit after chambered is to get out of his/her's range or ""rechamber"" them which is basically chambering their chamber. But unless you were chambered you are never really stunned enough to not be able to block in time, this once again just seems that you need to be a bit faster in blocking as well as more accurate at it but this simply just comes with time.   Guide on how to chamber   When i swing at them i get the ""dud"" sound effect, yet when they swing at the same distance and angle they magically get a hit and either stun me or kill me, which infuriates me to no end.   The ""dud"" or as many call it a ""poke"" or ""glance"" usually happens due to the lack of momentum. If I just stood still and face hugged you then attacked it wouldn't do significant damage. Try getting some momentum into your attacks by moving with your attack animation as well as aim for the chest/head to get the maximum amount of damage out of your swing.   The final gripe that i have is the somewhat stiff manual blocking mechanics. I love the blocking mechanics, and is by far the best iv seen in any slasher game, but i see so many times were i move my mouse to the right, and my character blocks up.    The blocking mechanics don't really feel stiff to me and like I said it comes with time to block well and it's something you should focus on because a good blocker can outlast their enemy easily.  tl;dr: These are common problems people are faced with in PvP just practice and when you mess up don't get angry think ""Why did that happen?"" ""How can I make sure I don't do that again and improve?""  Some MB melee guides:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9jHcZjWw9U  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5P7ySzesqY"

mountandblade,3duwd9,sdkegg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:27:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the guides but that is not what i need. Im relatively decent at M&B, and i consistently see these problems happening. If i knew how to get my Elgato to record PC gameplay then i would have no problem providing examples because it probably seems like im just making excuses.  ""The only time you are in a truly ""stunned state"" is if you were ""chambered"" what that means is that they blocked and attacked you at the same time, this is a complicated and risky move but very rewarding to the player if done correctly, two ways to avoid being hit after chambered is to get out of his/her's range or ""rechamber"" them which is basically chambering their chamber.

Guide on how to chamber""  This is untrue. When you are hit by any weapon in M&B warband you can be staggered, but this mainly happens when fighting people with two handed swords or polearms. your character is hit by a sword, they then go into a flinching animation and while you are in this state you are totally unable to block, the enemy then attacks you again and it kills you, and they tend to do it from the same direction.  I feel this kills the games skill gap, because iv seen so many times were this has happened to me and to enemies. I do think there should be a flinch animation, but i think it lasts too long, which is what causes the problems.  ""The ""dud"" or as many call it a ""poke"" or ""glance"" usually happens due to the lack of momentum. If I just stood still and face hugged you then attacked it wouldn't do significant damage. Try getting some momentum into your attacks by moving with your attack animation as well as aim for the chest/head to get the maximum amount of damage out of your swing.""  I understand this, which is why when i swing i turn into it, but even so the inconsistency with the amount of ""duds"" i get compared to my enemy, even if we are at the same angle and not moving is rather infuriating, although you most commonly see these problems when you get around to the enemies side and they are still forward facing.  ""The blocking mechanics don't really feel stiff to me and like I said it comes with time to block well and it's something you should focus on because a good blocker can outlast their enemy easily.""  The problem that i was having with the games block mechanic was the fact that it was reading my inputs for blocks wrong. I would move my mouse all the way to the right, click block and somehow magically still get the downward block even though as again i moved my mouse a different direction. My way to remedy this would be allow you to change your block direction while holding the block button.  Thank you for your detailed reply."
mountandblade,3duwd9,abearirl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:02:31 2015 UTC,"sword, they then go into a flinching animation and while you are in this state you are totally unable to block   this is called stagger and iirc you should almost always have enough time to block again   inconsistency with the amount of ""duds"" i get compared to my enemy   because your enemy is better than you and maneuvering their character and camera to increase their swing speed relative to your character   would move my mouse all the way to the right, click block and somehow magically still get the downward block even though as again i moved my mouse a different direction   make sure your mouse is straight and not angled, practice  i know 100 hours might seem like a lot to you but most of the good players in warband multiplayer have 2000+ hours played. basically every player who's ever tried to get good at warband dueling has had the same complaints as you and realized, with more playtime, that they were mistaken. keep playing and you'll see too. the duel server is the best way to get better at the game."
mountandblade,3duwd9,fraichedan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:51:03 2015 UTC,"""this is called stagger and iirc you should almost always have enough time to block again""   you should, but alot of time it doesnt happen, this is why i believe the animation should be shortened.   ""because your enemy is better than you and maneuvering their character and camera to increase their swing speed relative to your character""   So this still counts even if they are simply just walking forward, dont move to the sides or away from me, or if i happen to get around them and hit them in the back with a right swing, only to get a dud, they then turn to face me and stab me (while still point blank mind you) and deal damage to me.

mountandblade,3duwd9,fraichedan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:05:44 2015 UTC,"the part about stagger is true only for polearms, warband has increased stagger times for polearms as a sort of balancing of them being worse animations and usually stats than 2handers, the polearm stagger is always longer than other weapons and has a if i recall correctly, 1/3 chance to stagger you for a time that is long enough that if the enemy is positioned correctly means they can circle around your block and hit you twice with you being unable to block. the part about you hitting 'duds' could be a lot of things but is most likely you hitting at bad parts in the weapons animation, right/left swing attacks are based on angle to your opponent and duration while overheads and stabs are based purely on the duration of the animation, with the sweet spot of hitting being somewhere in the middle of it, and hitting at the start or end meaning your attack loses a lot of damage and thus is likely to glance or dud as you put it."

Have them follow you so that you can lead them into a charge. But at this level with C5-C6 cav alone you should be able to take them out no problem.

mountandblade,3drt3j,Muffinsborn,3,Sun Jul 19 01:02:29 2015 UTC,This has happened to me and it's really funny. Usually it comes from having that lord help you in a fight against party (or warparty of bandits) with a large amount of prisoners. After the fight that lord will purchase most of the prisoners resulting in this glorious army.
mountandblade,3drt3j,ab111392,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:23:42 2015 UTC,"nah he just has tons of men. He doesnt have any manhunters, caravan guards or merc swordsmen which is usually what you get from bandits."
mountandblade,3drtbo,Beanboy112,19,Sat Jul 18 21:05:13 2015 UTC,"wait, your horse got killed? Like, perma-death? It should recover for the next fight, and only get crippled after too many ""deaths"" on the field, after which it will eventually recover  There are numerous beginner guides available on this subreddit and beyond. For more in depth guides to particular facets of the game, feel free to continue asking. Here is one courtesy of /u/Raist1 (http://imgur.com/a/FMAqV)  My first piece of advice is picking your fights. Make sure, if you are prone to being attacked by numerous foes along your travels, that you move fast. Don't engage when the potential for high casualties is too high. This will save you money and lives in the long run.   To make money, you can try your hand at betting on tournaments you participate in (though at your level perhaps this may be too difficult). You can sell men into slavery (use blunt weapons and attack vastly inferior foes like looters), you can trade (buy goods for a low price in one town or village and sell them at another where it is valued more highly) or, if you gain enough renown, you can swear your allegiance to a King and be granted a fief, and make money of the rents of the land. You can also sell the loot gained from defeated foes. I recommend loot, slaving and trade to start with. You can, I suppose, loot villages, but you don't want to piss off entire factions until you are part of one yourself.  Budget your funds wisely. Make sure you have enough personal equipment to keep yourself alive on the field and an effective soldier. Also invest in upgrading some troops so they don't die frequently either. Keep an eye on your weekly expenditures and make sure you know you have enough money in reserve to pay for profit-less weeks, and keep your comings-in above your goings-out.   You can also do some menial quests for guild-masters, lords, mayors, village elders, etc. Make sure its not one that involves spending money or requiring men.   Having literally 0 money is a tough break. I recommend first getting swole. Practice the hell out of your combat skills, upgrade your strength and agility until you are mildly competent and can take on numerous looters. Winning arena meeles doesnt pay well but its something. Careful not to fall into debt. You can also tag along with Lords and help fight their battles. This will increase their favor to you and you can get better in the meanwhile, with the support of standing armies.   Once you pull together enough funds, talk to a guild master in a town and build a business there, and make sure it will be a profitable one. This will give you a steady income.   Good luck, let me know how it goes or if you have any other difficulties."

mountandblade,3drtbo,TrotsTwats,4,Sun Jul 19 00:46:55 2015 UTC,I recommend focusing on personal skills and dumping the party skills off to your companions.
mountandblade,3drtbo,Mephistopholees,2,Sun Jul 19 00:48:22 2015 UTC,"Focus on personal traits (and specialize in combat: I recommend focusing on some form of melee, board and sword is best), but make sure to keep a point aside for one of the medicals (wound treatment ideally) until you find Jeremus (look in taverns, he's free to hire and has a very small wage). Make sure to have some prisoner management too, for slaves. Otherwise, power strike, athletics, shield, riding, etc. is very important early game. This is to help develop into a proper soldier, and eventually win tournaments.  Putting some points into intelligence will help get you more skill points but strength is important for wielding and wearing better equipment and agility for moving faster and improving agility based skills like riding."

mountandblade,3drtbo,OhSweetShen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:23:10 2015 UTC,"Dyeworks are generally the most profitable, and the most expensive. How profitable an enterprise is depends on supply - an abundance of a production material drives the price of that material down and so it is cheaper to produce the end product. Also regard how abundant the end product is in the market - if there is a lot of it in the town then it will not sell for as much. Don't put too much thought into it, profitability doesn't change too much unless the city is sieged and taken (large loss of local wealth) or you flood the market with the produce, in which case what gives just sell it somewhere else dummy   Generally speaking, don't sweat it - what the guild master says is the most profitable at the time you talk to him will generally stay the most profitable. But make sure to invest in something that looks like it will pay off - if the most profitable enterprise you can get in a town is predicted to make 100 denars a week? Find a different town to invest in."

mountandblade,3dpeu0,H__D,6,Sat Jul 18 04:33:39 2015 UTC,Improved blocking. -  Block chance is based on weapon proficiency and varies from 70% for low-level bots up to 90% for high-level bots. Can be set to 100%.  Feinting. -  Bots feint at random intervals of around a couple of seconds.  Attack holds. -  Attacks are held at random for up to a second.  Faster attacks The delay between attacks has been removed.  Kick avoidance. -  Bots backpedal when a player in front kicks at them or when a weapon with crush-through is swung overhead.   Holy shit those bots are better than average SP player.

Countries are small (Scotland is like, two villages and a City), but the map is huge and you will have plenty of guns to play with.  Age of Conquerors has a lot of inaccuracies (Tricorn hats? Really?), but it does have guns. They don't emit smoke, though. (I always mute the game, so I don't know if they even have proper firing sounds). The map's just Calradia (I don't think it is Floris based).  Suvarnabhumi Mahayuth is set in southeast Asia, during the portuguese colonial times. There are guns and the map is not too small.  You could also try 1429: La Guerre de Cent Ans, it is set (as the name implies) in the 15th century, but you can use some firearms of the era.

The unit variety is awesome and the troop trees feel fleshed out and unique to each faction. The only downside is very occasional things that won't be translated into English (it's a Chinese mod) it doesn't impede gameplay though or at least it hasn't for me. Also no religion system but I've never seen the mods that have religion systems do anything interesting with it anyway.

It could provide you with information on how to track it down or info that someone, like WSE's creator, would know what is causing the crash at least.

mountandblade,3dufn2,Windyplains,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:01:14 2015 UTC,"As you're probably using a version of warband newer than 1.153, you might want to consider using the copy of WSE found on the Silverstag page.

I dealt with that same problem back when I played Warband native on 1 gb RAM and changing it made it better.   If that's the case, you might also want to lower texture detail.  Basically what happens is you run out of space to store the graphics the game loads so it crashes. By lowering the detail that will be attenuated and by loading on demand it should lessen the crashes."

It should make it at least somewhat better since it won't be trying to store as many graphics all at once, so you shouldn't reach the memory limit as fast. Instead when it needs a graphic, it will load it on the go.  You will see textures load on top of each other like say, you talk to a lord and the screen loads, it will be a colored blur on their chest for a bit before it loads the texture with the more detailed things, and stuff like that. And you'll probably have to restart the game occasionally (less than before). But I think it's worth it."

Limiting discussion with rude comments in no way helps anyone.
mountandblade,3ds6h8,Labdisco,10,Sun Jul 19 01:20:01 2015 UTC,"I am very glad (and quite proud) to see how much this community has grown and changed since I originally joined. It is by far my favorite community on the entirety of the internet, that is no exaggeration (Sorry, /r/gonewild).  Through all the bad times, I've had everyone here being helpful, supportive, and kind to each other. This Subreddit has been a home for me in a time of my life where I needed it the most, and I'm deeply thankful for that. There are people I recognize on this Subreddit and see helping on a daily basis. That is absolutely crazy to me, as I remember when some of them originally came to the Subreddit looking for help themselves.  That's the real reason I became a moderator here. It wasn't for any fake power or certainly the praise I get, but just because you guys are truly awesome and deserve a community to reflect that. I want to make this the coolest place I can, that's why I have been seeking out devs to do AMAs, working on redesigning the entire Subreddit, and still answering all the questions that come this way.  I know that 90% of you don't care, 5% haven't read this far, and another 5% don't know who I am, yet I love you all the same.    As an unprepared celebration, I'll be giving away five full Steam titles to the posters of the best OC over the next month here on the Subreddit.   Draw some fan art, make a fan trailer, write a tutorial/review/guide, anything original and amazing will be entered into the contest.  I have over 100 games to give away on Steam, so the winners will have a large pool to pick from.  Expect giveaways like this to become much more frequent in the future."

But you're probably under constant war due to having a low right to rule.  You get that up by sending companions as emissaries, making peace while at war (even if you're not the ruler of the kingdom you still get the bonuses), and other ways. There's some good guides for it around."

When I got the pre alpha ya there were some bugs but it was still like a kinda fun mnb mod bt now I go to play on it and they ruin everything that makes the game good. Took away the regular battle controls and changed them so u can only direct troops on this map thing. N on top of that I have no idea how to get new troops taverns only have companions and there are no villages to recruit from and the barracks r not accessible.

I haven't tested the features for being a King yet (about to though) but I'm looking forward to it.

I think you'd have an easier time with some better infantry against those retainers as they aren't that tough.
mountandblade,3doisi,Talmansen,2,Fri Jul 17 23:30:35 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll check out those Ironborn retainers. How many med did you have with you? Since the king has around 400 soldiers"
mountandblade,3doisi,Talmansen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:36:53 2015 UTC,"Around 110, my tactic was to take one castle and let the vassals attack me then hold them at a choke point in the castle. This worked suprisingly well and we managed to hold against an army of around 600-700. It was then easier to take the others with no armies chasing us or taking the settlements I just captured."
mountandblade,3doisi,Gen_McMuster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:41:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just tried that at longsister, but their chokepoint is garbage since its a large gateway. Still, most of my men died. I'm just gonna get those Ironborn retainers."
mountandblade,3doisi,Castle_Walls,2,Fri Jul 17 23:51:35 2015 UTC,"I'd stick with the Serjants. The retainers are kind of shite compared to how they used to be. they only get mail(~45 def) while Serjants get full plate(~60 def), their axes are very low damage for such a high tier unit and their shields are also easier to break than what most dornish infantry get.  I actually made an army that mixed vale Serjants and Veteran Retainers, the retainers died far more often(despite being more expensive). though they did move a little faster in a charge.  I'd say just get a bigger army and stack more surgery skill to soften casualties' effect on you"

The problem was that the only factions that invited me were getting absolutely wrecked. The first faction that offered me a vassalage was Swadia, but at that point they'd already lost Dhirim to the Khergits, Suno to the Nords, and Uxkhal to the Rhodoks. The second faction that offered me vassalage was the Vaegirs, but they had already lost Khudan and a swath of castles to the Khergits (and they were being seiged at Curaw).  So I just said ""Screw it"" and signed up for the Nords."

If you have enough manhunters in the party, it gives a prisoner management bonus (at least in Floris) so just get companions, give blunt weapons, travel from town to town taking 30 bandits hostage until finally you rescuse enough manhunters, and then protect them with your life so they eventually upgrade to elephant riders with like 250 charge or some stupid thing.  Editting because I forgot to add, just take mercenary contracts. In Floris they cover wages and then a little bit more I believe."

But you need to be able to maintain control over your troops and have a big enough party + high enough tactics skill to get that battle advantage every time.  I used to play balanced characters (low on AGI, tho) and now I'm starting to play CHA/STR builds. Nothing wrong with specing into strength. But you need to have troops to back you up."

mountandblade,3dlr5t,ZerCohen,3,Fri Jul 17 08:15:31 2015 UTC,Sometimes lords with smaller armies just take up defensive positions on hills at first but generally start charging once someone has been killed. Sometimes you have to try and provoke a charge by killing someone on your own and then running the fuck away.  If they don't do anything even after taking losses then there may be something up with your game.

mountandblade,3djxsb,aeronautically,3,Thu Jul 16 21:42:03 2015 UTC,Ask soldiers to use blunt weapons. If theu dont have one they just use their fists and get destroyed.  Using stand ground will get them killed too.
mountandblade,3djxsb,CRANIEL,2,Sun Jul 19 04:47:33 2015 UTC,"Dont try and TK your entire army, that will probably net you some bad karma. You can try  a) ordering your men to hold position and get dumped on by boiling oil/arrows/javalins   b) lead the enemy to the siege  c) Convince your marshall to attend to something else (he may initially say hes busy, but then break off later)  If he is in the middle of a battle and you aren't patient and/or duplicitous enough to kill that many men loyal to you, then you can try to convince others to give you the city anyway, and failing that, wait and revolt."
mountandblade,3djxsb,Mephistopholees,2,Fri Jul 17 01:10:00 2015 UTC,boiling oil  what???
mountandblade,3djxsb,blazomkd,3,Fri Jul 17 15:57:54 2015 UTC,"Stand under a gate in 1257, some will dump boiling oil on you. Its constant and does a bit of damage repeatedly until they victim falls unconscious. I would prefer it to be a user operated thing that has more instant effect (Like a deadlier version of chivalry with slower recharge), as it stands, the version in this mod only works in damaging the attackers a bit, unless the attackers get stopped at the gate (sometimes they get packed in too tight and cant hit the gate) in which case they all die"
mountandblade,3djxsb,Mephistopholees,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:04:56 2015 UTC,"You're best bet would be to do both.

mountandblade,3dh6ti,tupendous,6,Thu Jul 16 12:26:15 2015 UTC,Isn't the main point of them that they trample over infantry and knock them unconscious that way?
mountandblade,3dh6ti,58king,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:29:29 2015 UTC,The cavalry are still faster at knocking out the enemies if I recall correctly. The elephants were slower and blocked the way a lot of the time. It has been a while as I use Silverstag mod now.

mountandblade,3dhnik,AquamanIsKill,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:32:50 2015 UTC,I didn't like it because having the second shield made breaking their shields with javelins less meaningful and with the shield on the back it's harder to get hits with ranged weapons when flanking (at least I think it applies to this mod I don't know for sure).

mountandblade,3df5n5,MrPsychoSomatic,17,Thu Jul 16 06:28:36 2015 UTC,"Since the dawn of time, Mankind has struggled with the greater questions of life. Why am I here? Why do the stars spin in the sky? Why are feasts so common? And most important of all, the great question: what is horse?    This is a question which has puzzled scientists, vassals, and the everyday peasant for centuries. The very nature of horse is hard to pin down. What is horse made of?  Can it be used as a wall insulator? Is it sentient? Thorough research into the field has answered at least two of these three questions.   We now know that horse is made from a substance known as flesh. The source of which remains yet a further mystery to the nose, ears, and eyes of science. But which yields the delicious substance known as horse when it is stretched, steamed, and generally treated badly by a bunch of gods in the sky. We also know that horse can be used as a wall-insulation, albeit a fairly poor insulation and terribly pungent.   The final question: “is horse sentient?” remains unanswerable by the modern brain of Calradia. Experiments have shown that some horses are capable of simple mathematical equations, such as adding the numbers one and two, or calculating the start of harvesting season no more than 200 days in advance. Other horses have shown a much less impressive display of intelligence, by snorting loudly during menu screens or responding to the fairly banal stimuli of roaming caravans."

I made them stay and rode down the mountain to skirmish (horse archer OP). Then after I wasted my arrows and almost got my horse killed by a knight. So I go up the cliff with Crossbows firing at me from below and Crossbow and later axes going down.  At least my only casualty was my horse and the enemies was nearly their entire force.

Just watch out for the higher level, frequently faster mounted bandit parties."
mountandblade,3dfm5h,bulksalty,2,Thu Jul 16 16:28:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks. The trade route didn't exactly work. Most of the villages didn't have the goods they were supposed to, but generally there were a few cities that were always reliable. My route consisted mostly of starting in Sarranid lands with my wineries, heading to Khergit territory to buy cheap spices, selling those spices in Curaw to buy cheap iron, selling that iron in Jelkala to buy cheap grapes, then sending those grapes to my wineries in the Sultanate. It was profitable, mostly. However, I did this with a different mod (Silverstag, which is similar to Floris). When I tried it in Floris it was slightly less profitable. Still, a merchant build is definitely viable. Thanks again!"
mountandblade,3dfm5h,Lelorinel,3,Fri Jul 17 15:22:14 2015 UTC,"It's all about finding a circuit for you to follow in order to maximize profits.  In native, for example (not sure to what degree floris prices differ) I would buy spices in Khergitland, sell it and buy cheap iron in Curaw, sell that in Rivacheg and buy cheap raw silk, sell that in Wercheg and buy cheap salt, etc. etc., then repeat.  You organically find where certain items are cheap, then chain your visits together so you can make it a continuous cycle of profits."
mountandblade,3dfm5h,Firewind,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:10:53 2015 UTC,"You might want to try Viking Conquest. I heard it was super buggy at release, but having recently gotten it I've grown to absolutely love it. Main thing is to trade with villages and sell in cities. Regions have specific tendencies to sell certain items low, and buy others high. I figured out a pretty decent trade route and made a lot of money early on. The hard part was building relations with lords in order to build productive enterprises in their cities.   Prior to Viking Conquest I had never attempted to trade before. I think it started because I wanted to improve relations with the villages in order to more and better recruits. Leveling troops is a lot harder in VC since the troops are a higher level and training doesn't kick in till much later than Warband. Noticed that the had more than just food (tbh even food can return a decent profit) and it was cheap. Something about going to various villages to attain quests and collect items, while fighting bandits along the way was super satisfying. It felt like I was more a armed merchant caravan than a mercenary."
mountandblade,3dgdzu,SmokedSalmon5,3,Thu Jul 16 01:43:03 2015 UTC,"If you /really/ want to make a companion your vassal, then make sure its a noble one, first of all, and I'd assume their personality plays a factor in it as well. Most lords don't like it when you give another one a fief, but it varies.  Upstanding/Honorable lords don't care. Martial lords care but only a little bit.  So I would say try to judge based on your companions personality type, if I could help you further then just speculation I would, but I can't, sorry."
mountandblade,3dgdzu,Gunnerstrip7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:08:07 2015 UTC,"Not an answer to your question but...  I wouldn't make a companion into a lord unless I was completely desperate. Why?  The size of your lords armies depends on a few factor, but mostly their renown. Companions have usually have bad renown ~300 unless they've won a lot of tournaments or your playing a special mod.   So imo companions are better off in your army. Take on any lord that comes to you even if he has a bad personality and stick him with a small village (that way when he revolts he can take any land with him), if your desperate. Or just wait until you get a good natured lord to come to your court."

Otherwise, I don't really think there are any mods with very weak factions, I could be wrong though. If I remember right the northernmost faction in Perisno is rather weak, but don't take my word on it."
mountandblade,3degqo,wheatjesus,3,Wed Jul 15 17:27:49 2015 UTC,"Most historical mods have a few really weak factions. 1257ad has a nice abundance, Latin empire, Wales, and the Gaelic kingdoms are all pretty weak off the top of my head. There's a lot of small Italian factions too that aren't as weak but have but scary neighbors like the HRE and France. Edit: jk I should have read your entire post, I'm gonna leave this here though in case anyone wants this information still. Playing as the natives in the 16th century sounds maybe like what you're looking for.   16th century mod has the Knights of St John who I think start out with only Malta. You can also play as indigenous cultures who tend to have less armor than the European powers which might create the feeling of being downtrodden.   Also gekokujo has the ikko ikko, I think they start out pretty weak but powerful enough to be able to do something with."

You can join all of the new factions, but two factions require you to either have low honor or be a female/well respected male(role reversal-like faction). In general, the base factions retain what they're known for (Nords being good infantry, Vaegir archers, etc) and the invading factions are based off many things like lore (Geroia) or simply being more powerful bandits (Barbarians).

mountandblade,3de5tp,I-want-margarine,3,Wed Jul 15 15:52:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know specifics, but my understanding is that the thresholds for certain things like vassalage are higher for women (on default), so ""Off"" disables those and makes playing a female character no different than playing a male character, as far as the treatment or reactions from NPCs. (Other than marriage, I assume, but I don't know.) Not sure what ""High"" does - makes it even worse, I guess?"
mountandblade,3de5tp,Super_Jay,2,Wed Jul 15 16:48:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah I tried ""high"" once and basically it just increases the various thresholds. Aka, makes the game more grindy because you won't get your first town as easily. Didn't seem to change much more so I reverted back to ""Default"" personally. In the end anyway when you reach 800+ renown, those differences don't really matter anymore. Especially if you use Medium AI changes, which makes it far more likely that a King will award a fief to the one who conquered it."
mountandblade,3de5tp,Wendek,2,Wed Jul 15 22:13:55 2015 UTC,"I thought as much. I thought at first that it made lords more likely to be arseholes towards you, but that is pre-determined by their personality (martial, bad-tempered, sadistic)"
mountandblade,3de5tp,Wendek,2,Wed Jul 15 22:29:11 2015 UTC,"It probably does increase the threshold until which they'll be arseholes to you. When your renown is high enough, sadistic lords won't say that you'll be beaten when you get home, but instead that ""many a grieving widow"" knows your name.    Again, eventually in this game any female player character will be treated just like a male (except for marriage obviously), that's how powerful renown is. In fact, it's funny if you ask for vassalage when you're already strong enough (some mods make mercenary contracts much more interesting than in Native, which means you can spend a lot of time without being officially a vassal and still make a decent income), the King will say ""I'd never give a fief to a woman!""... and at the exact same moment you'll notice that you did get a village. Which is annoying to me because then I have to give it back and take a 3 relation hit. (villages are worthless, I'd rather have no fief especially since I generally ask for vassalage right after conquering a town anyway, which I intend to be mine)"
mountandblade,3deu8x,wren42969,2,Wed Jul 15 18:44:31 2015 UTC,You need to raid and prey off bandits like you said.  This is the only way to build up experience.  You have to be smart with the battles too.  Don't just think you can take on anyone.
mountandblade,3deu8x,Firewind,2,Thu Jul 16 13:43:19 2015 UTC,"How many productive enterprises do you have set up? You should have one in each Tunsberg, Ribe and Dorestad at minimum. The more the merrier since you won't be at war with everyone all the time.  What's your charisma/leadership at? Goes without saying why that's important.  What is the make up of your army? Infantry is far more effective than spearmen except around tier 4 where spearmen reach parity. Also if your refuge can't support a trainer upgrade it. Getting a solid number of tier 3 troops is both inexpensive to maintain and effective on the battlefield. I'd bank the tier 4 troops you have in the refuge to save money for the time being.  If you're not at war I also suggest trading to get a decent cash flow. Wool sales well in Frise.    P.S does anyone feel like when you kill the crew of another person's ship you should be able to take the boat and sell it or keep it being that any boat even pine and in disrepair sells for like 5000 penings.   You can capture enemy boats. I've had it happen once. They were bandits though."

Enterprises, in my opinion, are best to support your army, so you don't have to fight or slave to afford your army. Even if your weekly income drops to -100 or -200, that is acceptable and can be made in whatever battles you fight.  Bandits will be your best way to gain exp and some loot, but it doesn't hurt to assist any ally in a battle if they stand a chance or you tip the odds in your favor."

mountandblade,3dbmdj,ChurchillianGrooves,21,Wed Jul 15 00:37:19 2015 UTC,Swadia is just so bad. Like always. It's like amazing how absolutely shit they are. Maybe it's because they're in the middle of the map so they got 4 factions that want to fuck them?
mountandblade,3dbmdj,Venne1138,5,Wed Jul 15 00:41:10 2015 UTC,That plays a factor. They're also really spread out so a city can fall before the Marshall gets there with reinforcements.

mountandblade,3dbmdj,Barbareed,3,Wed Jul 15 01:44:55 2015 UTC,"Iirc, it goes something like this:  Middle of the map -> Everyone declares war on you -> lots of defeats  -> Lords relation with the king plunges -> Let's hold a feast!

mountandblade,3dbmdj,Huller_BRTD,3,Wed Jul 15 19:35:47 2015 UTC,"It's because their strength is in cavalry, and Rhodok strength is in spears and crossbows. Early game spearmen are easier to raise than cavalry, so Rhodok same tier troops wreck Swadians. And Rhodoks just generally always have a siege advantage because of that.

mountandblade,3dbmdj,Jarbungo,4,Wed Jul 15 03:30:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's possible, but the next Floris update should basically have a seperate option for King Harlaus II, and his AI is entirely redone to hate feasts and all of his dialogue involves hating butter. I'd play it. Oh and also he isn't absolutely useless at everything. Honestly I do know the Rhodoks are one of the ""Power Factions"", but I would almost argue the trio of power factions in Floris is Nords, Rhodoks, Khergits. Those high ranking cavalry and archers become scary in sieges man, even going up against the other 2. Also, compared to the Nords and Rhodoks they move super quick."
mountandblade,3dbmdj,Thegn_Ansgar,9,Wed Jul 15 11:34:29 2015 UTC,"The problem with King Harlaus is that Swadia is so large that Harlaus ends up losing relation with his lords, this in turn causes him to hold feasts so as to maintain relations. The issue is that when lords lose their fiefs or get raided, their relations go down with him again. If it can't be taken care of by the AI, it turns into an endless cycle. All kings in the game actually have the same AI though. You could replace him with King Ragnar, or any of the other kings, and they'd be forced to have to feast all the time because of game mechanics."

mountandblade,3dcy8w,InsufferableCush,3,Wed Jul 15 08:09:28 2015 UTC,"I find Pendor deals with this pretty well. Lots of minor factions to annihilate, more you want to gain rep with, and a custom knighthood order to train the shit out of. The mod naturally pushes you towards the end-game, where you start taking on the massive unique spawns and conquering the map.  1257 gives you a similar mechanic with a town that develops over time. Having something to keep chipping at while you build renown is fantastic.  I don't really have any general advice though, sorry! I'm with you - I struggle to stay interested once I'm past bandits, but before reaching the marshal stage. My big goal is usually get a garrisonable fief, but after that there's this palpable sense of ""now what?"""
mountandblade,3dcy8w,-Arkennon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:43:51 2015 UTC,"but after that there's this palpable sense of ""now what?""   Yeah, at best I spend my days paroling my nearby fiefs and don't get me started on those ones half-way across Calradia from my castle/town, those guys are fucked and I can't be bothered. But other than that, I chill at the my castle/town, waiting for war (which gets monotonous at times) and the random tournaments, which I'm surprised I didn't win like all the time. It's soo easy now, I still win with a lance against 5 dudes with arming swords and javelins.   I've tried ACOK and as a fan of the series, it's great. But it mostly feels like it's a texture mod more than anything else. You get different village backgrounds, livelier taverns, different village elder missions, and a nice workaround the hunt bandit missions by going to an island city hehehe  But then what?"
mountandblade,3dcy8w,bulksalty,3,Wed Jul 15 11:09:54 2015 UTC,I believe the diplomacy mod allows you to trade those halfway across Calradia fiefs with a lord who has a similar fief near your others.
mountandblade,3dcy8w,Gunnerstrip7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:23:08 2015 UTC,"I have this same problem in a great many mods. Perisno, Phantasy, even Brytenwalda all seem to have that /gap/ in between the end game and mid game. You're setup, got a garrison, you're doing good for yourself. Then you just get a massive sense of ""Now what?"" And sort of lose interesting.  1257 hates my computer but its fun when it works, I haven't done a dedicated playthrough of PoP yet, shame on me. I find that mods that add smaller factions, extra quests, and more then just the basic bandits are a help.  Nova Aetius is a good example. It adds allot of extra stuff to do. While you're deciding what to do, why not rebuild some old Calrad architecture, exchanging materials, and gold, for renown and prestige? Or why not train and become a master at a trade? Little things like that tend to help me out of the rut.  As for base Mount and Blade? I can't really say, other then try participating in intrigue, maybe instigate a few wars on your own, remember you can start wars as well! Just go and raid a caravan/village in your factions name."
mountandblade,3dcy8w,Ledgo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:56:10 2015 UTC,"I set personal campaigns out. I don't always follow the marshal because often they are stupid and want to summon everyone to curb-stomp a castle with 150> people and no lords in sight.  If you plan to break off from the faction soon, I would start building relationships. Otherwise, I would begin to build a steady income through fiefs and enterprises. I had a lot set up in places I either wouldn't war anytime soon and friendly towns.  If you haven't, find a spouse. Begin picking out select lords to join you if you are going to break off soon."

(And on a side note - actual cities would be nice, rather than dinky little towns)  But we'll have to wait to see what sort of scale Bannerlord is capable of.   Also, defensive preparations like trenches, cavalry stakes, etc. would be tits"
mountandblade,3de1m9,Mephistopholees,7,Wed Jul 15 16:58:06 2015 UTC,"For that, you should be looking towards the total war series."
mountandblade,3de1m9,Thejoosep23,7,Wed Jul 15 22:16:38 2015 UTC,"As someone else already suggested, try Total War series if you want these battles. I can't imagine Bannerlord supporting this"
mountandblade,3de1m9,vitskikipxo1234,5,Thu Jul 16 00:34:35 2015 UTC,"People, you need to look up what the downvote is for. I simply said that battles of this complexity wouldn't be possible in Bannerlord if it were to resemble a Mount and Blade game."
mountandblade,3de1m9,vitskikipxo1234,0,Thu Jul 16 01:43:27 2015 UTC,"This can ONLY happen if either in native Bannerlords or modded Bannerlords you can set up units by yourself and like what kind of starting formation and such. And that the AI is actually pretty smart. I am playing gekogoju right now and I must say the AI is different and I was a rifle infantry of Lord Honda, and I shot you not the smart ass actually secured high ground and fired down on our enemy with ease. I was surprised the AI was this smart. It might have just been a fluke due to how the map was layed out because they did their ""spiral dance"" they all do. Like just going around the edge of the map lined up towards each other(that shit get boring after the 10th time)  I hate that I don't have that and I need to quickly before every battle shout out the same line of commands every time. And Native have no real formation command which I never really want. Unless I was playing a game which was heavily focused on line infantry.."
mountandblade,3dbqkl,nerdfighting,12,Wed Jul 15 01:05:47 2015 UTC,"I'm also quite curious to know if the AI will starve you out. When I see the AI just waiting outside my town for days, I get scared and I end up attacking them."
mountandblade,3dbqkl,Hades_212,8,Wed Jul 15 01:13:11 2015 UTC,"Oh no they attack, dude... They just have that prep time.. They will attack you. Depends on what type of castle but usually it takes a day."
mountandblade,3dbqkl,Hades_212,7,Wed Jul 15 01:18:03 2015 UTC,I was playing ACOK and I swear they were outside for 3 days. Maybe they were not actually sieging

mountandblade,3dbqkl,NotAlotBot,3,Wed Jul 15 01:28:16 2015 UTC,I should mention that I have seen them change their mind tho. They were sieging and after a while just ran off. But I have never seen them starve me out.
mountandblade,3dbqkl,kalamadama,6,Wed Jul 15 01:34:47 2015 UTC,But I have never seen them starve me out   Would be stupid for them to try. It's thirty fucking days. You could take over half of Caldaria in the time it takes to siege down one castle.

Plus, sitting outside the castle can leave you vulnerable to enemy attacks, which will siphon off soldiers on your side."
mountandblade,3dbqkl,KanarieWilfried,4,Wed Jul 15 02:24:03 2015 UTC,Indeed. It is probably not efficient in any way. But maybe from a roleplaying perspective it can be fun.
mountandblade,3dbqkl,xaliber_skyrim,13,Wed Jul 15 03:42:21 2015 UTC,"Starving a castle lowers their morale. As the morale becomes lower, troops will start to desert. When you outnumber the enemies inside substantially, they will finally offer to surrender.  Unfortunately, this is not a viable tactic in Native (or many other mods). You will almost always run out of food, get attacked by passing lords, or not have the manpower to force them into surrender once they run out of food."

I'm always happy when I see that purple text because it almost guarantees a swift victory.  I will admit their lancers and tier 6-7 Cavalry in general are a pain, but that goes for any faction. As soon as you get rid of the 20 or so tier 7 that the lord has, the rest is easy-peezy-lemon-squeezy.  With that said, if i'm not paying attention, the Khergits will always find a way to gain a majority of land in Calradia. So I don't know what's up."
mountandblade,3dc8w3,Muffinsborn,5,Wed Jul 15 05:27:53 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing that their land-taking is the result of them being a bit faster on the map than the other factions, which gives them a campaign advantage."
mountandblade,3dc8w3,polopac27,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:27:57 2015 UTC,"That's why I think they're so strong, they might not be able to hold up for long against Rhodoks or Nords, but they can wipe weaker factions off the face of the map surprisingly quick."
mountandblade,3dc8w3,Soyuz_,4,Thu Jul 16 11:45:17 2015 UTC,"To me Khergits were always more of an annoyance than a threat. Whenever they attacked me I would always beat them, but the battle would last FOREVER because they were all on horseback. And in sieges they are the easiest of all to beat."

mountandblade,3daw71,legatocoyote,3,Wed Jul 15 02:11:24 2015 UTC,Can I ask what faction(s) your troops are? The Elves are really a pain I usually wait for the Zann to appear before going after the Elves. When I siege I try to balance out my infantry and archers so if my infantry is pinned. I order my archers to take the wall or find a area where my archers can hit the enemy archers. When your troops are in a bottleneck like that try and get your archers into a position to hit the enemy. Sometimes you will have to order your infantry to fall back or follow you and set up a kill zone for your troops. Best of luck getting rid of the of the Redwood Nation.
mountandblade,3daw71,Cdmbr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:02:02 2015 UTC,"Every single Redwood troop (aside from the Redwood Merc troops) has bows, no?  That said, dump all your high level units into a castle, get a ton of recruits, auto-resolve."
mountandblade,3daw71,Prometheus720,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:36:43 2015 UTC,"The worst thing you can do is bring swords to a bow fight. You, my friend, found yourself in a bow fight, and I suspect that things would have gone much better for you if you had brought only archers, stayed right there on the ground, and chewed up the walls. Your character would be instrumental in your victory because he would be the fastest killer on the field, which would give your troops a numerical advantage which would eventually snowball.  That's how I killed Rhodoks in Native. I just shot them down until no archers were left, and then charged with Nords."
mountandblade,3daw71,Prometheus720,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:03:08 2015 UTC,"My character's not a bow person; I'm playing a two-handed berserker who throws axes for a living. Sadly, I have very limited ammunition and only about 250 skill in throwing, so I didn't get to kill many."
mountandblade,3dbh1t,Hades_212,3,Tue Jul 14 23:52:12 2015 UTC,"It's not saying that you have those troops. It's just saying that you have a moral penalty on units from those factions, probably because you are fighting them or have been recently. If you have no units from those factions then it doesn't affect you. If you did then their individual moral would but that much lower, just like the moral of the positive faction would be that much higher.   As for your moral the thing hurting you is party size. You need less men if you want higher moral. Also a lot more food. What do you have three types? Get some variety."
mountandblade,3dbh1t,njm1314,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:35:51 2015 UTC,I had no idea that was how it worked. Is 160 troops considered too many? I will try getting more food variety as well. Thank you.

There are ways to offset it, higher charisma, food, titles (I think, this may just be in certain mods), party cohesion (not having a lot of troops from different factions), heroes having high moral, winning battles, etc..."

I remember reading your troops lose morale if they fight troops of the same faction, but that isn't what's happening. Also worth noting that the different alignment groups don't like eachother though I'm not sure which units are which by name alone.  Come to think of it, I'm editting in just since this is a Phantasy thread, is there any way to really go about things beside stack horses, spam tournaments, and then buy gear from the Four Ways Inn?

That was before I knew about ctrl + spacebar, so moving across the map took a long time.   My first game in warband I played for the Sarranids and had three towns before starting my own kingdom with my fourth town. At that point I had 10~ lords immediately show up in my castle on day 1 and I had snowballed so much the game wasn't interesting anymore.   I am playing Perisno, but it's the same thing, I have 2 million aurums so I don't have to worry about money. I probably won't finish it."
mountandblade,3d9c1b,fanzypantz,2,Tue Jul 14 22:46:42 2015 UTC,"That is where I hope Bannerlords make endgame a lot lot more interesting because you spend more time there than leveling up everything(skills, level, renown, right to rule, relations) Like that part still takes a lot of time, but the time after you become king until you have unified the lands are way longer so I hope they focus and balance it a lot more. Say making it harder to level up renown for instance.. I mean I can go from 100 renown if I start as a noble to 300 in the matter of an hour or two with tournaments alone. Especially if there is a few feast going on right out of the bat.   And if you just hire a bunch of companions and send them to give you right you rule right out of the bat, while also hooking up with Thera(my fave, big family and good looking) to get even more right to rule... You can efficiently become either a high profile vassal of a king or your own King in the matter of a the first game session.   I dissect the game to find the most efficient ways possible and it makes my play-troughs quickly after I become king, because after that its so much of the same."

I think they could easily just nerf the renown given from tournaments or remove them altogether to fix that.

I could not find any discussions in the forums relating the bug with my version, so it seems that it must have been fixed.

mountandblade,3d9rgm,MitchyMatt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:03:02 2015 UTC,Do the Lords have village fiefs? If not they won't replenish as they won't have a source of troop replenishment. Thus they stay in the castle until you give them enough troops for them to travel around with.

mountandblade,3dab6o,caedicus,4,Tue Jul 14 18:54:10 2015 UTC,"Give them more property, which will increase their troop counts.  But sure, it can be worth it to give troops to Lords that are low.

mountandblade,3dab6o,treygreen13,6,Tue Jul 14 19:42:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not certain exactly how autocalc works out NPC v NPC battles other than knowing that quantity is the most important thing.  However, I say to give them mid-grade troops (the same goes for castles) because they're not much more expensive per unit and if you do end up fighting alongside them in a battle instead of auto-resolving you don't want to be defending a siege or taking on a king's army with half of your forces being recruits. They might hold up well in auto-calc considering their terribleness but they'll get mopped up in a real battle."

mountandblade,3d9sae,Super_Jay,3,Wed Jul 15 09:43:41 2015 UTC,"Well, the obvious way to break out of that cycle is to stop getting massacred, but it's hard to help you do so without more details. Can you elaborate a bit to describe what's typically leading to those battles where you're so outmatched? Are you just not noticing that the enemy army has twice the number of troops you have? Are you noticing but just unable to outrun them? How are you typically conducting battles, do you just have everyone charge in blindly?  Regarding the king granting you fiefs, I'm going to copy one of my comments from a similar recent thread, you might get some add'l info from the responses on that one too.   On being awarded fiefs: There's some complex math that goes into it (you can find the formula on the wiki) but it's based on your current number of fiefs, your overall renown, and just plain luck. Focus on increasing your relation with your king, the current Marshal, and the most influential lords of your faction. You also want to keep increasing your renown by various means - tourneys, battles, etc. The more battles you win against your enemies during wars - especially alongside your fellow lords - the better your reputation will be. If you can convince other lords to support your claim to a fief, their renown will count toward your claim, which is why you want to get in good with the political decision-makers within your kingdom.  Taking castles or cities on your own will increase the chance they'll be awarded to you, but it can still go to other lords. As you're still in the fairly early game, you're unlikely to be able to take any on your own for a while, though, so I wouldn't worry about that until you can field a decent army of 150-200 soldiers or more.  For sieges: the lord who 'controls' the siege is assigned to do so (behind the scenes) by the Marshal of the realm. TMK, it's not possible to be assigned to lead the siege by your Marshal; you'd have to be the Marshal yourself. To lead your own siege, you have to besiege a castle or city on your own, directly (not by joining a siege that's in-progress). You can sometimes do so with some help from other lords by requesting they follow you (or you can suggest they lay siege themselves, and if they trust you, they'll do so and then you can help them).      Basically, to increase your chances of getting better fiefs, you want to spend time doing quests for your liege and your Marshal, on winning victories in the field during wars, on winning tournaments, and on boosting your relations with the upper echelon of the aristocracy so you can enlist their support when an important castle or city is up for grabs. As you become more well-liked and tales of your valor spread throughout the kingdom, the king will look more kindly on your achievements, especially as he'll consider you a personal friend whose aid has proven invaluable to the realm. Good luck!"
mountandblade,3d9sae,Krazen,2,Tue Jul 14 17:43:59 2015 UTC,"Well you yourself are progressively getting better after each ""loop"". You have more exp, ideally you've bought some nice gear, maybe your companions are leveled up.  When your party's high enough, get some levels of trainer. Recruits turn into Knights/Huscarls in no time. Make sure you do missions for towns, so you can recruit 30 footmen at a time or something. Get yourself and your companions kitted out in the best gear available; talking armored head to toe + horse.  Then just get that prestige up by kicking butt. Chase down enemy lords and take them one by one. Then your army gets bigger and bigger, and your troops are even higher level."

mountandblade,3d7ke8,Barbareed,7,Tue Jul 14 14:39:34 2015 UTC,Check your mod options in your camp. There should be an option to disable bandit warlords.
mountandblade,3d7ke8,-Novex-,2,Tue Jul 14 03:26:11 2015 UTC,I mean these aren't bandit warlords. These are just standard bandit stacks that are larger than most armies.
mountandblade,3d7ke8,Zephabee,4,Tue Jul 14 03:28:17 2015 UTC,You can change the maximum number of bandits that accompany the leader.  IIRC The default floris number of bandit stacks following one guy is 8 but you can reduce it
mountandblade,3d7ke8,TrotsTwats,3,Tue Jul 14 03:46:16 2015 UTC,"....  I'm not sure you understood what I said.  There are no bandit leaders. Like at all. I disabled them.  Its just regular bandits having 300+ soldiers and hundreds upon hundreds of prisoners, of idiots who tried to leave their castle, just walking around."
mountandblade,3d7ke8,TrotsTwats,3,Tue Jul 14 03:56:17 2015 UTC,"When you turn bandit heroes off it only prevents new parties from forming, the old ones stay. These large parties are what has become of those spawned in before you disabled heroes.  To get rid of these parties, you will have to beat them in combat. My advice is to either use superior tactics or many disposable troops to overcome their numbers.  If you just want to clear them up without the hassle, turn on cheat mode and force-kill all the enemy troops as they spawn."
mountandblade,3d7ke8,TrotsTwats,2,Tue Jul 14 05:22:57 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I totally understand. So if I start a new game and disable bandit heroes these giant 300 man groups won't appear?  Because it seems that they're appearing from standard bandits and not the hero bandits. There are like 2 hero bandits (the one's that have names) that I've seen and while they have big divisions they're still not comparable in size to just regular bandit mob number 32.
mountandblade,3d7ke8,SpookySkeletons,4,Tue Jul 14 05:29:20 2015 UTC,"These large armies form at the beginning because having bandit heroes on enables all bandit parties to have more units. As these larger groups continue to win battles and pillage, their size grows exponentially (as you have noticed in your playthrough).  Once you disable bandit heroes, all parties spawned after that point can not benefit from the larger initial party size. This means they can not win too many fights and secure hundreds of prisoners, meaning they can not grow into massive armies.  The longer you have heroes enabled at the start, the more bandits can spawn with huge parties. I personally like leaving it on for a few levels, that way there are a few bandit armies I have to worry about, but not an overwhelming amount.  Keep in mind, the party that defeats the bandits takes the majority of prisoners. So if you join a group of manhunters and defeat the bandits, you'll now have an unstoppable party of manhunters to destroy any bandits in the area."

mountandblade,3d7ke8,Peter100893,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:19:01 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying. It's a single party with 300 men or many single parties with 300 men each, right?  This indeed comes from the bandit lord thing. When the bandits as a large group defeated their enemy and freed the prisoners, they recruited them. Thus they grow. When you disabled the bandit lords, you did not delete the already existing huge parties, which just grew and grew.  If you defeat these parties they won't become this large again, unless by some freak chance.  Just kill them all, they will mostly be shitty troops."

And I imported my character from a vanilla game that was already level 28. I have one village (which gets raided constantly), and my party limit is at 102. It's super hard to gain renown compared to vanilla. The troops in ACOK are also stronger than vanilla, and harder to kill, but there's a good amount more depth to the different factions. For instance, I allied with the North, who have a good mixture of strong infantry, archers, and cavalry (though I haven't been able to get a huge amount of those yet). We went to war with the Iron Islands early on, and they have ridiculously strong infantry. So much so that I'm very cautious of engaging any party larger than 50-55 (when I have 80-100 troops). It forces battles to be a little more tactical. Positioning is more important."

The only problem is its hard to start your own faction there because a lot of the factions have a shit ton of vassels with large armies of veteran sellsword troops (which are over powered as fuck). So you have to get a very large army if you want to strike out on your own there. Also I have a question. How do you leave lords service and still keep the equipment without deserting and pissing off every faction? If you ask him to leave he takes your equipment.  Edit: Also i think the option to go to Essos in the beginning is bugged. every time i accept it I end up being in Westeros anyway.

mountandblade,3d6njd,Iron_Rage,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:57:13 2015 UTC,"I'm on my first run so don't an expert by any means but what I did was just loot.   What makes Perisno ""fast"" in my opinion is mostly that leadership gives now +10 party size. This is huge.   After you begin taking out mid tier bandits of 50+ troops (that usually have around 30 prisoners with them) you simply begin to snowball. After liberating a few groups you will easily max out your party size. This is when you begin looting.   Seriously villages in Perisno are insanely rich and prosperous at the start. You of course as a man with a keen eye for business take advantage of this situation by providing your services as a mercenary. After all, war is a racket.   Villages in Perisno give so much money. So, so much money. Some will even give you loot that retails at 10k+! Each item! Bars of gold and bags of gems do this. Merchants of a single city can't even handle the amount of loot a single village can give and you find yourself splitting the loot between two cities.   You should not have to worry with enemy lords if you factions keeps them busy, and even if they don't they shouldn't be a problem since your 130+ army (with lots of elite troops if you got lucky with the rescues you did) will scare all but the bravest of lords away.   You will amass a serious fortune which you will spent on enterprises. Don't just go for dyeworks, 20k gold is pretty steep even by Perisno standards. Buy smart. 20k gold for a 5000 a week payout is not worth it when you can get 4400 a week with a 10k investment.   Do this a few times and you'll be getting 20k+ gold every single week. This means that even fully stacks of top tier troops worth over 7k a week is not a problem at all. Not when you are this rich.   Also castles and cities have very small garrisons at the start. Around 180 for most castles from what I've seen so far. With a 130 or so mid tier and above troops you will only need the help of one Lord or maybe two to take one without many losses. So start building up relations! Politics are as important as always."

I meant that it seems that I  Perisno getting Dyeworks everywhere is not always the best choice as they cost 20k gold to make. That's a lot. If you can get similar return for the other enterprises then by all means do so. I said 10k as an example because I believe that's what an oil press costs in Perisno.

mountandblade,3d3zgi,Sea_Raider,2,Mon Jul 13 11:07:00 2015 UTC,Why is pendor considered the hardest mod?
mountandblade,3d3zgi,Avagantamos101,5,Mon Jul 13 11:30:05 2015 UTC,"Because of the troops.For example the Shadow Legion Centurion has 500 one handed,two handed,polearms and throwing.And of course the noldor.They have the best bows in the game.They shoot hell of a fast and are the most accurate thing i know.the best troop in the game! .Ok i got a bit out of the way here.Basically,the world is full of these guys i just showed to you from level 1 and they all want to drink from your skull.TLDR:Elite troops spawn everywhere at the start and they all want to f**k you over.  Edit:Also after a while you play Heroes start spawning.They have huge armies of elite troops,but when you destroy them you get to have a ""Qualis gem""(the rarest item in the game) or just a ton of gold and loot. And sometimes just armies spawn like ""Jatu army"" which is atleast 1000 big and wants to kill you."

mountandblade,3d3zgi,Logene,2,Mon Jul 13 13:44:50 2015 UTC,"Well im not so good to give you any,i found THIS.I am sure you can find things there.I have been playing PoP for some time now and the tips i can give you.  1)Cavalry is strong in this game  2)Start befriending Noldors pretty early.Thesse guys hate you at the start,but if you help them in battle they start.Or you can fight them,get a lot of slaves and then you can free them for relations.(1 man 1 relation so if you end up getting 20 slaves you get 20 relations with them)Read more at the link i gave you.  3)There is a free qualis gem in Rain(Not sure if that is the correct name,but its a RavenStern city.)The qualis gem is the rarest item in the game.  4)Not really a tip but something i have learned. Ravenstern-Good starting location,good inf.archers and some good cav archers.  Sarleon-Seems having a lot of heavy cav,have not played them alot so i cannot say for sure  Fierdsvain-I have not battled againist them nor battled with them,so i cannot say for sure.Inf seems pretty good.(If you are not gonna fight againist this nation,in alot of games they are gonna snowball and get half the map)  Empire-NO CAV(expect nobles)this faction i have played the most.A mix of some heavy spearmen and Legionares and some heavy crossbowmen behind them,this fac reks pretty good.  Dshar-These guys have good cav archers,light cav,and they have this kind of infantry that does a lot of damage but dies fast."

mountandblade,3d3zgi,MitchyMatt,5,Tue Jul 14 02:33:43 2015 UTC,Bullshit enemies. There is no way a single knight could take down 80 men by himself (happened to me 3 times)
mountandblade,3d3zgi,Prometheus720,2,Tue Jul 14 02:53:38 2015 UTC,"And you just mentioned one of the reasons why I love the mod. It makes things challenging early on, but still progresses quite well."
mountandblade,3d3zgi,Sea_Raider,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:18:16 2015 UTC,Yeah I think that if knights were that good it would make it a fun challenge to attack one or many of them
mountandblade,3d3zgi,-Arkennon,2,Tue Jul 14 05:24:44 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. If you take them down though, you can get really valuable prisoners if you capture them, really good loot, and a lot of exp. Getting a plate harness to drop early on is a godsend if you can pull it off."
mountandblade,3d3zgi,Iron_Rage,2,Tue Jul 14 08:18:08 2015 UTC,"Well it's not bull since you can field higher tier units yourself. But why couldn't a knight in this game kill dozens of units if they are superior in terms of stats, weapons, and armor? Besides I don't think a Knighthood Knight could kill 80 units unless they're lower tier bandits or farmer parties."
mountandblade,3d3zgi,-Arkennon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:07:50 2015 UTC,"I would make a note about Gekokujo and its historical accuracy.  It IS accurate on a lot of things, but not so accurate on others. Here is a statement I took from the mod page on ModDB:   The mod tries to be accurate with regards to the general conditions of the time, but deliberately ignores particulars as a design decision. ""Lord Oda"" represents Nobunaga, but isn't really him. Gekokujo is not a historical simulation, but not because I believe it detracts from gameplay or enjoyment--so although it won't be perfect, I am not going out of my way to flout history and accuracy.   The things introduced by the mod which are most inaccurate (to my limited knowledge) are some of the castle designs and perhaps the extreme lack of cavalry. An interesting note is that at least one of the clans which DOES use cavalry was the clan who was famous for popularizing the cavalry charge in Japan. There are a lot of small things like that which you pick up on.  Everything else which is inaccurate is really the Warband platform's fault. Obviously troop counts are low, tactics are messy, and the AI is dumb.  If OP plays Gekokujo, I'd highly recommend accompanying it with a wikipedia adventure, a little bit of Extra Credits History, and maybe a quick geography quiz, since all the place names are real as far as I know. It really enhances the experience."

mountandblade,3d3zgi,Chiksika,16,Tue Jul 14 13:55:35 2015 UTC,"Floris  Seriously, I can go on and on about Brytenwalda or Clash of Kings(GOT mod), but in all honesty I spent more time playing Floris than every other mod combined (including vanilla.) It has all the major features and still feels like the original game. Just some interesting features:   Expanded troop trees Detailed creation menu that actually tells what kinda character you're getting HD textures Battle continues after you die so you don't get horrible autoresolve casualties Ability to join a lords army and work your way up the ranks Overhauled tournaments that makes fights more interesting Choose your own weapon type for a tournament Massive bandit hordes in the late game   If you have never played with mods before, get Floris. It's the king of warband mods and probably the most feature complete."
mountandblade,3d3zgi,DerTanni,2,Mon Jul 13 13:19:33 2015 UTC,I will definitely be trying floris out. It seems to be the most enjoyable mod I have found so far.
mountandblade,3d3zgi,DoopSlayer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:46:30 2015 UTC,Floris is excellent. A good starter mod for anyone who recently got the game.

mountandblade,3d3zgi,Frugtkagen,4,Mon Jul 13 11:09:33 2015 UTC,Brywalda Dark Age Britain and Ireland this mod eventually became Viking Conquest which was meh at best   Iron and Steel it's like native with fantasy elements and horse charges that actually hurt though on easy it is very easy and more troop types
mountandblade,3d3zgi,ajaytech,3,Mon Jul 13 23:04:16 2015 UTC,"The Eagle and the Radiant Cross is a very under-rated mod IMO. Very fun factions, unique lootable weapons, firearms. Hasn't been updated in a while but it works fine with Warband version 1.134. You can get version 1.134 from Taleworlds site, ftp://ftp.taleworlds.com/../ and it will automatically detect you have a legit Steam copy of the game and allow you to d/l it. Install it separately from your Steam copy, so then you have 2 different installations of Warband on your machine.  Mod available here: http://www.nexusmods.com/mbwarband/mods/2086/?

mountandblade,3d3zgi,ajaytech,2,Mon Jul 13 16:02:36 2015 UTC,Maybe I can throw a question in here too. In what ways did VK improve the general gameplay? I bought it to support TW and play some MP rounds but never played the Singleplayer. And I don't want to downgrade on features I'm used to which I have in Floris.
mountandblade,3d3zgi,rhorama,2,Mon Jul 13 14:34:00 2015 UTC,"Gekokujo is my pick. A nice map, challenging without being unfair, an interesting independent settlement function that is fun to play with. It is easy to jump in without looking up stuff specific to the mod. joining an army is also a nice addition from the normal game that makes early game much easier.  Sea-Raider mentioned Anno Domini so I'll mention that it runs very slowly for me. It ran so slowly that I stopped playing it as saving took over a minute and the game map was very laggy due to the size and number of factions."
mountandblade,3d3zgi,ajaytech,2,Mon Jul 13 18:52:32 2015 UTC,AD1257. Realistic setting with realistic kings and factions. Has great AI and tons of features. My favorite is how you play as your troops when your main character dies.
mountandblade,3d3zgi,kirsion,2,Mon Jul 13 18:55:31 2015 UTC,I really think Suvarnabhumi Mahayuth deserves a mention.
mountandblade,3d3zgi,fvcvxdxfc,2,Mon Jul 13 22:22:43 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on what your looking for.  Prophecy of Pendor is the best for a new, unique world and game. It's very polished, it's set in a very cool fantasy world that has it's own lore, and contains a great backstory/endgoal to reach. It's not really as hard as people say, but it's tough enough to be a fun challenge. It's a great experience if you're looking for a polished, expanded mount and blade in a new world.  The Last days of the third age - The absolute best mod if you like LOTR. It's phenomenal, it revamps the m&b system completely in terms of recruitment, pay etc but it does it in a realistic (Setting wise) fashion which really puts you in the shoes of a commander in the war of the ring. The team that designed this really had passion and it's visible. If you want to slaughter orcs and save middle earth there's no better mod.  ACOK- Looks really fun if you like ASOIAF but it's super demanding on the pc and mine is clearly not good enough :( I'd definitely try it if you have a good pc!"

In addition, javelins per bag vary based on javelin type, with throwing spears and angons having only 1 javelin per slot (unless it has a 'large bag' modifier) while regular javelins have 4.   Also, I think the Goidels use throwing darts sometimes, which have more ammunition, if my memory serves."

Lion, Dawn, Eventide and Griffon are all better equipped however, so they are good alternatives.  Cavalry Archer - Clarion Call  Trash: Dragon, Valkyries, Windriders, Falcon, Raven Spear, Radiant Cross.  All of this is based on personal opinion."
mountandblade,3d4p0m,Sathkur,3,Mon Jul 13 23:46:53 2015 UTC,"Am I correct in thinking Order of the Silvermist Rangers for archers and ebony gauntlet for infantry?    Basically, yeah.  IIRC for cavalry they're all heavy knights. I think there's a band of horse archers as well, but I can't remember the name."
mountandblade,3d4p0m,Scout1Treia,2,Mon Jul 13 14:34:52 2015 UTC,Larian Outriders? How do you actually recruit them though?  Edit: NVM seems they'r in the order of the clarion call
mountandblade,3d4p0m,Scout1Treia,2,Mon Jul 13 14:58:05 2015 UTC,"Clarion call sounds familiar, I believe those would indeed be the horse archers."
mountandblade,3d4p0m,Orcrist9000,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:06:12 2015 UTC,"Really heavy horse archers, yeah. I find they're decent enough with spears, swords and shields to act as heavy cavalry. I wouldn't recommend letting them go toe to toe with dedicated close combat Knighthood Orders without good backup, but otherwise the Rangers otCC are versatile and powerful units against anything below Knighthood Order level.   Larian Outriders are normal horse archers, on par with Mounted Rangers I would say, but I don't use them much so hard for me to say anything specific."
mountandblade,3d4p0m,wooiljung,2,Mon Jul 13 20:16:05 2015 UTC,"Best equipment? The ones with Noldor on it, except for the sword. I find Strange Ebony Sword to be better than Noldor ones"
mountandblade,3d4p0m,blanetrain,2,Mon Jul 13 14:44:32 2015 UTC,"Yes but EG function as very capable archers themselves since they carry siege crossbows giving them huge range and killing power. Immortals also function as a very powerful heavy infantry.  Best mounted knights are the shadow legion, im pretty sure they have highest stats out of all the mounted knights and they have great equipment and horses. Basically they murder shit. But you kind of lose the ability to mass recruit them if you switch to the pendor faction.  For the CKO the very best equipment would be the noldor gear, shits expensive though, takes a while to train the CKO just to be able to equip it and also costs a hilarious amount of money. It really depends what you want your CKO to function as, you're free to make them whatever type of unit you want such as foot knights/archers/heavy cavalry/horse archers etc."
mountandblade,3d4p0m,Paeyvn,2,Mon Jul 13 16:00:10 2015 UTC,"Silvermists have the potential to be the best archers, but starting out they are inferior to the normal Pendor Grey Archers. They have lower proficiencies, same hp, weaker armor, and approximately equal strength bow/arrow combo. Grey archers use short composite bows and Silvermists use regular Longbows, but Greys use I believe bodkin arrows where Silvermists use regular +1 arrows. The better armor on the Greys and higher proficiencies make them better until you've upgraded your Silvermists at least like 5 times.  Ebony Gauntlet are probably generally considered the strongest infantry order, the other good one being the Empire Immortals.  As for a mounted order for Pendor? Order of the Griffon are decent, but you have to support the claimant to Sarleon and have him in your party to get them, which then means rebelling later on. I also think their plate armor might be weaker than normal like Sarleon knights, but don't quote me, so might want to avoid them for that if that's the case. Order of the Eventide/Dawn are also pretty decent, Dawn having weaker armor but higher stats, but both still good and train from Pendor knights. Then I also believe the Raven Spears train from Pendor knights and they're pretty standard decent cav, and their sergeants are also cavalry which can get you a good mounted army all around.  End of the day though, your best bet for mounted IMO is to build a custom order and outfit them as you see fit. Noldor gear is the best you can get, but there's still some decent options outside of that if you haven't gotten the standing with Noldor to learn to make their gear and captured one of their lords to learn how to make their best stuff. Seriously, you don't learn everything the Noldor have from talking to their smith at 100 standing, you have to capture Ithilrandir or Aeldarian to learn how to make the best stuff like Rune Armor/Ancient Plate. This is something you have to do before you make friends with them for obvious reasons."
mountandblade,3d4p0m,Orcrist9000,2,Mon Jul 13 17:04:50 2015 UTC,"Order of the Griffon are decent, but you have to support the claimant to Sarleon and have him in your party to get them   Running your own kingdom and following Pendor culture also allows you to use the Griffons (I did that myself). I haven't compared but after seeing them in action, I'd say the Lion Knights are somewhat tougher and harder-hitting as they often use two-handers, whereas Griffons always have shields.   The Griffons are nothing special compared to other Knighthood Orders imo but I like to roleplay and the Griffons are the old Pendor Kings' KO or some such."
mountandblade,3d4a13,stinkadickbig,8,Mon Jul 13 12:09:42 2015 UTC,"Get your starting gear from Sea Raiders. Get some for your companions too. Check every tavern and prioritize hiring companions over buying marginally better gear. Also, don't bother buying gloves/swag horses until you have your money base underneath you. Get mamlukes for their blunt weapons and take prisoners to sell to make your money. Buy enterprises with that money ASAP. Also do the rounds with tournaments as much as you can stand. You should honestly go around the country just doing tournaments in early game. Suck Yaroglek's dick a little, he'll treat you nice if you become his vassal. I've heard that Graveth is the nicest liege, but Yaroglek is usually ok for me. Don't become a vassal immediately. Try to become a merc instead, as soon as sea raiders no longer challenge you. You get all the benefits of being a vassal except land (which you have to waste time defending), but you get paid for your troops. It lets you max your party size at all times. Use your time as a merc to make money, level yourself, and level your companions. Do a CHA/STR build. Leave ALL party skills including trade, tracking (which sucks anyway), spotting, pathfinding, medical, and engineer to your companions. Your ability to fuck shit up at speed depends on your ability to participate in battle and how many troops you can bring on a long campaign. In fact, you should actually leave most of those skills to one or two companions and spec the others for combat (and have them act as your personal guard, particularly in sieges). Tracking is your lowest priority, then trade, then spotting and looting. Pathfinding is absolutely paramount to a speedy run. Use your time as a merc to build up a good strong character, a good money base, and good strong party skills. Keep your skill slaves at the bottom of your troop register, in a separate group (I call them Puffballs) which you always order to the safest place you can, just in case they spawn. You'll want good medical and pathfinding before you start taking on lord parties. Engineer may be useful, but as a merc you won't be taking many castles if any. Send out companions for Right to Rule continuously. Keep taking prisoners and give yourself a healthy prisoner management skill to handle them with. Once you are confident in your money base, you may become a vassal in order to gain RtR. You should feel comfortable when you have an enterprise in every faction and gold in the tens of thousands. 50k is plenty. Income is more important than stockpiled gold, though. As a vassal, you have a few jobs. First, get some land, preferably a town which will later become your (initial) capital. Second, do your best to end wars as quickly as possible to gain RtR. Don't worry too much about sieging enemy territory that you don't intend to keep. Your goal is fuck bitches in the field so that they know they can't win. Third, keep sending out emissaries. You're a vassal pretty much purely to get RtR before you split off. Fourth, gain a few staunch allies in your faction. One or two strong, landed allies is better than a bunch of people at +10. Fifth, weaken the faction which occupies the land where you wish to birth your kingdom. Don't totally eliminate the faction, though, until you split off. Once you've gotten yourself some RtR and a companion with high Engineer (8 or above, I'd say), it's time to break off. If you want to keep your land, take castles and hold them long enough for your liege to reject one of your requests. And of course stockpile your town with as many troops as you can afford without going heavily in the red. Your faction may attack you, in which case you should prioritize defending yourself. However, when you're free of their grip, you should immediately end the faction whose de jure territory you're in. I did this to the Nords, but it doesn't really matter. At this point, just prioritize taking as much land and income from one enemy at a time as possible. Prioritize towns if you're strong enough, particularly those you have enterprises in, as those will take away more land and money from your opponent. Prioritize ladder sieges and ignore siege towers until your opponent faction's only castles require siege towers. This is blitzkrieg. Don't be afraid to leave smaller fiefs undefended, either. You can take them back very easily, sometimes even without a fight. When possible, try to recruit those lords you allied with to be your vassals. Do it after you get some land. Eventually, you'll snowball and more vassals will come in. When everyone starts to gang bang you, stockpile tons of recruits in the places you care about (300 will deter almost anyone) and, if one of the attacking factions is nearly dead, finish it off rather than engaging the others.. Become emperor of Calradia."

A new player with no skills should not be able to do it.  However I see no reason that a legendary character fighting against crap opponents shouldn't be able to do it.

It's nothing more than a question of logic and physics.  If you swing a sword at someone, there is the possibility that it will cut straight through them.  If that happens, the sword will continue on its original arc and if a second person is within that arc, they are going to be hurting as well.  I'm not saying a level 1 peasant should be able to cut through multiple enemies.  However a strong character with a heavy weapon should have a chance for their attacks to be able to hit more than one person.

In several instances it cuts straight through.  He even admits he wasn't even swinging that hard.    Finally, a video where a Scottish Claymore cleaves a skull, easily.

mountandblade,3d3gsa,I-want-margarine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:15:02 2015 UTC,"Expand diplomatic options and mechanic (i.e. you should be able to ""send a diplomat"" to a foreign king or general).  Rework conquests of castles/towns. There should be an option where after you take a town, you have an option to either A. Keep for yourself, or B. Subject to Liege's Discretion. If you hand it to the liege, you get a relationship boost and a higher chance of getting that territory. Also, lords that lose land and then regain it (themselves or other lords taking it) should basically have a stronger chance of re-acquiring that land.  I'd adopt the ""crown authority"" laws from CrusaderKings II into the game as well. Add more intrigue, allow for assassinations (either personally carried out, or ordered).  EDIT: After reading some here... why not literally implement CKII's inheritance and such? You'd get married, have kids, and then you'd keep going until something ends up killing you (either some sort of random, low chance; or you'd let the player decide after a defeat for RP purposes). You die, you become one of your kids, and follow the inheritance laws forthwith. Rinse and repeat. What /u/Prometheus720 said."

mountandblade,3d23j8,Avagantamos101,7,Sun Jul 12 22:17:16 2015 UTC,"Mod Description: 1257 AD is a conversion mod based during the thirteen century. This mod is my favorite on this list mostly due to the names of the characters. They are very surprising accurate and I feel that adds to the immersion of the mod.  Current State: Complete. The version I have as far as I know is very stable. However, I believe another update was launched not to long ago.  Last Update: Stable in terms of game play.  Features: Having an entire map of Europe would make for a bogged down world map. However the developers took the time to reduce the lag during travels. Depending on ones system it could be a bit bogged down when speeding up.  Factions: Holy Roman Empire, Crusader States, England, Scotland, France. Many smaller kingdoms.  Map Size: At the time of the mods first release it was one of the biggest in the game, this meant that the amount of settlements, towns, castles, and villages all made for some awesome immersion.  Replayability: Writing this made me want to go play this when I finish. One good thing I feel is a positive is the ability to automatically sign on with a nation if you choose to be a noble. You will be assigned a village and must be able to protect it from the first day.  Balance: Larger empires might find it hard to keep together. The king may indite dishonorable vassals, while at the same time finding it's self crumbling due to rebellion.  Story/Characters: Little story, however the characters are legitimately named vassals from the area and time.  Difficulty Level: Easy for nobleman. Do not need renown to get accepted as a vassal. Harder for some depending on the country they fight for.   Flow: ??  Support: Active community constantly adding new content to the forums. Dedicated sections for things such as screenshots, bugs, and tutorials.  Future Development: In the year of our lord, 1257 Anno Domini, version 1.11 was release to the public.   Potential: Allows for people to build empires that could never be seen in the original vanilla mod.   Shortcomings/Bugs/Errors: Economy is completely shattered. Most everything will be seen deserted. Due to a lack of caravans the  cities are finding it hard to trade.  Pros: Large map, Ship transport, large empires, massive battles Cons: Lord names shorten if a player kingdom is established. Very grindy mid to late game.   Recommendation: Do not use spear men. Find they are nothing more than cannon fodder.  About the Author: 1257 AD was created by Othr."

mountandblade,3d23j8,Sea_Raider,3,Sun Jul 12 22:57:56 2015 UTC,"**Prophesy of Pendor**   Mod Description-A mod that takes place in the Fantasy world of Pendor.Considered one of the hardest mods ever,because of the many strong enemies you encounter from level 1.  Current State-I would consider it finished,rarely small updates and bugfixes.  Last Update-May 2,2013 came out hotfix 3.611,which fixed some bugs.  Features-There is so much features,which you can find here),but i will list some of the major ones:  Knighthood orders: you can join and rule,and most importanlty,make your own!You can make your own troops from scratch and build them exactly like you want.This feature has never been seen before in WB mods.(Even though making your own order is VERY expensive.)  Minor factions:Most importantly the Noldors,who you can befriend and you can buy their troops,their armor(the best in the game) and go to their tournaments,what are a lot of harder then normal.But the prizes are worth it.Once i got a armor that sold for 22000 and gave 63 armor(i think)  Heartbeat quests:Some mercenaries knock on your castle door.Do you recruit them for a big price,or let them go?A heretic is stealing homeless children in your village.What do you do?(Tens of things like that)  Factions  Ravenstern,which from what i have seen is more archer focused(?)  Sarleon-noble pricks.They have mostly heavy cav,because they are too ""noble"" to fight on land by themselves.  Empire-All infantry and archers(expect nobles).Looks like a mix of nord infantry and rhodok crossbowmen.  Dshar-Cav archers,light cav and glasscannon infantry.Most similiar to ""Drahara"" from Perisno,i would say'  Fierdsvain-They seem to snowball 70% of the games.I have not seen their army myself,but from the wiki it seems they are infantry based.  Map Size-Seems about the size of the Caladria map.  Replayability- Pretty good,in addition the knighthood order,you may make a new knight every playtrough.  Balance-Pretty good expect the Fierdsvain snowball in 70% of the games.  Story/Characters- Pretty deep lore for a fan-made MBWB mod.Find more here.  Difficulty Level-A lot of people have said(even the devs) that this is the hardest mod of MBWB.  Flow- Flowin`pretty good(huh?)  Support-The forum is still pretty active  Future Development-It seems to get less an less updates,but recently they said they would add a nice shiny armor or something in the game,which is nice.  Potential-Already a very good mod.  Shortcomings/Bugs/Errors -For the 1000 in-game days i have played it  Pros-a lot of features,new items,basically new everything.  Cons-Cannot really say if being hard is a pro or a con?  Recommendation-Cavalry is superior in this mod.  About the Developers -I did not find any particular names.  Huh,i must have spent an hour at least doing this.And sorry for the grammar guys :)Im not even sure if i did this right."

mountandblade,3d214q,MrTurleWrangler,12,Sun Jul 12 21:58:04 2015 UTC,"Enterprises in each city--generally, my first is weavery and dyeworks in Rivacheg. It's a 10,000 denar investment, but when the Vaegirs or whom ever owns the town and surrounding villages are not at war and thus the villages not being looted, expect 1,500-2,000 denars per week. Usually fetched 500-1,000 per week when the villages are looted (still worth it). Rivacheg dyeworks is hands down the most profitable enterprise in native. Your second enterprise should be a brewery in Dhirim. Grain is dirt cheap there, and even though there is plenty of ale it sells for a lot.   After that, ironworks in Curaw is the way to go. I've seen ironworks in Ahmeradd do well too, but not as good as in Curaw.   Now it gets trickier...the other good enterprise locations I have seen are Oil/Wine press in Veluca, Tannery/Oil press in Jelkala, and either linen weavery or bakery in Shariz (can't remember).   Most of it is just basic economics, supply and demand. So in Rivacheg raw silk is quite cheap compared to the rest of Calradia (dyes are always cheap so they don't really matter). But no one in Rivacheg makes velvet, so its rare and sells high...but even if the supply is high, the demand might be low--this is why bakeries are a waste of time. Every village in Calradia already makes their own bread, so demand is low. That is why dyeworks in Jelkala often has negative income...demand is so low because there are already plenty if velvet merchants there.   Breweries are the weird exception to the rule it seems...grain is generally cheap, even when supply is high or low, it stays below 65 denars. Ale, which is made from grain, sells for more than double that, so even when in Dhirim there are plenty of breweries around, you still get nice profits. For this reason, I usually plop breweries all over the place.   edited for format and spelling"

mountandblade,3d214q,aron1900,11,Tue Jul 14 13:18:58 2015 UTC,"Floris is a good mod for after you get used to a bit of Native gameplay. Surgery is your friend, your wife, your dog and your Palmela Handerson.  Trainer is your affair.  Party skills work better on NPC followers (if you haven't met any yet, check out the tavern when you go into towns, you can meet people you can recruit that won't ever die in battle and are very useful to use as party skill bots since you can choose how they level up). Enterprises errywhere. You get an enterprise. And you get an enterprise. EVERY TOWN GETS AN ENTERPRISE! They really help pay for your armies. When autocalculating battles, quantity is better than quality. Same goes for what castles or towns NPCs choose to besiege. So you might want to get a mod that allows for battle continuation after you get knocked out in battle, and fill fiefs you own with low tier units even if temporarily, to scare away possible sieges. Right to rule will save your ass if you decide to start your own kingdom. Trading is very beneficial once you know the prices on different towns, and horses stored in your inventory will help you move faster when you're carrying a lot of items that would slow you down. Yes, weight matters.   And that's bout all I can think for starting tips. Didn't want to spoil too much."

mountandblade,3d214q,Hjaldrgegnir,6,Sun Jul 12 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, also, something that's really useful: Units higher up in your party screen join the battle first.   So if you have it set up T1, T5, T10, Companion X, Companion Y, T2, T4, you're more likely to see T1 units when you join a fight with your troops. Then T5, T10, CX and CY and so on.

Surgery also saves a good chunk of your trained men from dying.   Get on the good side of a faction and become their mercenaries. Don't become a lord until you feel financially stable as mercs make money based on numbers and have a party full of peasants and sitting in a town will literally make you money.  I'd also like to add that the Prophesy of Pendor mod is the best mod ever."

Run ahead and raze it first so they just guard you and you reap the plunders. Also, if you see a battle going on, join it and when you win you usually get a ton of loot. From there on you can have a large party that will pay for itself by defeating others. Training, surgery, and first aid really help. Remember to level trainer on all companions and yourself."

mountandblade,3d214q,Super_Jay,2,Mon Jul 13 00:13:15 2015 UTC,"A few weeks ago I wrote up a brief Beginner's Guide to Warband that might help. It's not intended to be comprehensive and cover everything, but it may help with a bit of a roadmap to the early game.   As far as building armies: You want ranks in the Leadership skill. Having high Leadership enables you to field larger armies and decreases the costs of your troops' wages. In the guide, I recommend forming a smallish army and then taking a contract from a kingdom to act as a mercenary band. They'll pay your soldiers' wages for the duration of the contract, so it's a good way to build up your army without breaking the bank. (That said, while the king is paying your tab, you'll want to invest in enterprises or create income in some other way so you can eventually end the contract without going broke.)"

If he is a prisoner in an enemy party, good luck trying to rescue him. Your only hope is to bait the lord into a battle with your allies or to wait for your commander to be dumped in a prison cell. If he's in a prison, you'll have to break him out.   Go to a nearby settlement and ask the village elder to start a fire on the edge of town. He will likely say no, but some money might persuade him. Once the fire is ablaze, the castle's garrison will quickly set off to investigate the smoke on the horizon. This will leave only a few troops behind to guard the dungeon. Enter the castle and find the dungeon keeper. You have to get the keys to the cell, so either convince him to hand them over or take him out. As soon as you have the keys (by killing him), enter the prison. Find your general and tell him you're breaking out. Be sure to order him to wait and let you handle the fighting. If you let him help you, he can be knocked out and the prison break is a failure. Take out the few castle guards and then you're free to escape. Congratulations, you have rescued your commander, been awarded a ton of relation and renown, and now you're no longer a traitor!  If he's not in prison, pester other vassals to find out his location. They might not know yet, so check back often (also check your reports tab).   Once you know where he is, move as quickly as you can and rejoin or leave his army."

Enter cheatmenu in the box.  After that happens set up camp. You should see the following: CHEAT MENU Scroll down to the bottom and select Set Debug Messages to Econ only Hit shift-~ again and issue the following command nocheatmenu.   If the last step does not stop it then simply reopen the command bar and issue cheatmenu.

mountandblade,3d0buu,Chieftah,17,Sun Jul 12 12:32:37 2015 UTC,"Do you like getting slaughtered five minutes into game by a group of three troops? Do you like to train troops for several real-life days to their final tier, only to see them get slaughtered easily? Do you like to focus on where you're going on the overworld at ALL times, with the consequence of not doing so resulting in a battle against armies 800+ strong? Then POP is JUST THE RIGHT MOD FOR YOU!  Experience the world of fantasy, elves, and knighthood chapters, as the elves tear you and your puny human army apart limb by limb, you are required to try to obtain a fantastically hard-to-get fantasy currency used for getting anything powerful in the end game, and grind for endless hours to become ""honorable"" and ""favored"" by a knighthood order! The various new minor factions will confuse you at first, but you will quickly become familiar with them as they roflstomp your little army, be it early game or mid game! The 'honorable' knights, who fight for justice and honor alongside the protagonist, has always been a bore to you? Have no fear! Some Knighthoods in the world of Pendor abhor the norm, and will not hesitate to throw themselves and their top-tier equipment and mounts at you at every chance they get! Tired of the easy, low-return tournaments in Native? Then you will love Pendor's tournaments, where you have a chance to win up to 30,000 denars, and most likely lose all your betting money by NPC troops with 500 proficiencies!

mountandblade,3d0buu,wooiljung,2,Sun Jul 12 18:54:54 2015 UTC,"The Noldor are interesting, really. Everyone's terrified of them because their first encounter inevitably sees their entire army wiped out with no Noldor casualties.   But if you come back later on with top tier troops - Shadow Legion is probably best - one good charge will shatter their ranks. You'll still hurt, but they're not the unstoppable force everyone spends the whole game assuming they are."
mountandblade,3d0buu,-Arkennon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:53:38 2015 UTC,"But that's the problem- you are hurt. The shadow legion cost at least 10 prestige per troop, and that's not something that's recoverable even."
mountandblade,3d0buu,Malgas,10,Mon Jul 13 11:50:55 2015 UTC,"Think of it like Morrowind - absolutely no level scaling. And the top level troops are insane compared to anything in native. Bands of T1 & T2 bandits co-exist with T7 knight orders that hate your guts. Pendor is about being careful, and being smart. Build up slowly, and never bite off more than you can chew.   But the range of enemies ensures that there's always someone you can challenge yourself against - or who will challenge you. I think it's what you're looking for - it's at least worth giving a go!  As far as textures go, it looks fantastic. All the factions look distinct, without sacrificing their serious aesthetics."
mountandblade,3d0buu,GrimmestFandango,2,Sun Jul 12 14:35:31 2015 UTC,Morrowind had level scaling.  Just not to the point where everything in the world was always at exactly your level.
mountandblade,3d0buu,Prometheus720,6,Sun Jul 12 17:49:41 2015 UTC,"Yea it's great for that. Even with the difficulty on the easiest settings, it's quite a learning curve. Early game is divided into two categories: things you can't kill, and things you can't afford. Early-mid game is when you've been grinding long enough that you can afford a small number of the super-expensive companions and troops required to keep you alive against the smaller parties of special bandit types, hostile knights, and minor factions- but you yourself are still too weak to help out much against the higher-tier enemies. Mid-game you're able to actually contribute against the better enemies, but not without caution. You can start doing some really fun and challenging quests for the knighthood orders where there's actually quite a high chance of you failing. Pendor is constantly being invaded by massive minor faction armies that sack towns by themselves, and the victory conditions for the game require you to defeat all of them and their legendary leaders- probably more than once each. A lot of the answers on this sub regarding some of the more challenging quests and engagements of this game recommend auto-calcing some of the battles, if that gives you an indication. There's a lot more to be said about this mod, but I've rambled enough. It's my personal favourite. ACOK is also a pretty good challenge compared to vanilla."
mountandblade,3d0buu,GrimmestFandango,2,Sun Jul 12 15:59:15 2015 UTC,"ACOK is not that hard to start up, though. Not nearly as hard. I quit playing for fear of spoilers and for interest in other mods, but I didn't have too many problems once I got over the whole ""OMG the arena is so hard!"" stage."
mountandblade,3d0buu,DuckPolica,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:44:45 2015 UTC,"Yea true, just a big map and expensive troop upkeep to make things a bit more difficult. Nowhere near the learning curve for Pendor."
mountandblade,3d0buu,GligoriBlaze420,6,Mon Jul 13 09:22:22 2015 UTC,"The best mod imo  Everything is tight, always something to fight, great everything. Honestly it's what vanilla should have been"
mountandblade,3d0buu,Glista_iz_oluka,4,Sun Jul 12 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"It's great, especially in the early-game. You will spend the majority of the first 10-15 hours or so basically running away from any band of Knights, Demons, Cultists, Mercenaries, Noldor, Jatu, and faction armies (if you join a faction early on). Why run from them? Because they will absolutely butcher you. There will be times where you are level 5 or 6 with tier 2 or 3 troops and you will be facing enemies like Hero Adventurers, who (IIRC) are level 60 with the best gear you can possibly get and maxed stats.   Also, when you do start playing (because you absolutely must play it at least once), do not venture near the Jatu unless you're fast. Because they will run you down and they will kill you. Their lancers go through tier 1-4/5 troops like a chainsaw through butter. Have fun!"

mountandblade,3d0buu,ChurchillianGrooves,2,Sun Jul 12 22:45:12 2015 UTC,"It's hard it a good way. Not impossible, especially if you know what you are doing. It never loses that thrilling feeling of excitement when you go into battle because even at level 50 with great equipment there are armies that can crush you.   Damn when you hear that creepy Heretic music and see some Demonic Magni charging at you, oh that sweet feeling of anticipatory dread..."
mountandblade,3d0buu,Murzynorix,2,Sun Jul 12 19:16:55 2015 UTC,Get a good lance as soon as you can. Even top tier Calvary will go down with a jatu honor lance to the face even if you're level 5.
mountandblade,3d0buu,ajaytech,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:19:10 2015 UTC,"I recommend A New Dawn. Top tier units for all factions are totally insane.

mountandblade,3cz451,mememan68,4,Sun Jul 12 10:02:38 2015 UTC,1257 AD is easily my most favourite mod.  It's set in the time frame of CK2 as well so you can relive the crusades or do some other shenanigans in the medieval world.  It does start showing its faults after a few in game years however because the map can become quite gorey with perhaps France owning a single castle in the middle of Russia.
mountandblade,3cz451,DiglettMcDickNuggets,3,Sun Jul 12 12:25:50 2015 UTC,"A Clash of Kings:  Since you sound like a ASOIAF fan.    Brytenwalda:  I'm not a huge fan but I can't deny it's a good mod.  cRPG:  Again, not a huge fan, but if you like a bit of MMO grinding mixed into your game, check it out.  Full-Invasion:  An awesome mod, one of my favorites at the moment.  Fight against hordes of enemies using tons of new classes and items.  Gekokoju:  If you feel like being a Samurai instead of a Knight.  Very polished in my experience.  Napoleonic Wars:  Can be fun, especially with an organized regiment.  Perisno:  Interesting one, I've been meaning to put more time into this.  Similar to PoP in the sense that the difficulty is ramped up.  Prophecy of Pendor:  Hard to explain how great this one is, check it out and find out.  Persistent World:  Turns Warband into an MMO.  I've heard bad things about the community, though.  The Last Days:  A cool LotR mod.  A bit buggy in my experience, though.  Viking Conquest:  I pooh-poohed this mod thinking that it was a cash grab.  Then a friend gifted it to me and I found out it's worth every cent.  Great storyline and a truly fresh take on the game.  Almost feels like a sequel.  Warsword Conquest:  If you like Warhammer, this mod is great.  Even if you don't, it's still fun.  Lots of neat things."

(Fancy being a wookie? you can, just don't end up fighting wookies they're quite tough!, lord john learnt the hard way)  Gameplay - Pretty much dope, the sounds overall and different types of sabers and weaponry to have as a force sentitive user and other classes, as you start you can choose who you wish to be as, soldier, bounty hunter and theres around 4-5 more other options. I've only recently started playing it and at the moment its tough but managing with credits and an army. It's that enjoyable that you would want to make a new save to fight for the republic with the rebels (the rebel models are so epic) and it is just the best mod to get. I haven't covered much for the mod there is much more to it. But heres a link for the video if you want to see.

mountandblade,3cz23i,Prometheus720,2,Sun Jul 12 12:31:00 2015 UTC,"Personally, Perisno was so much to play, but it just seemed to lack a bit of structure so to speak. It isn't entirely bad considering it is a sand box, but I wish there was something that a little extra in it that would tie the lore to the overall game more than what happens. Prophecy of Pendor reminds me of ACOK, in that it shies away from a completely random, open universe and sticks to a more, Skyrim-esque, structured game. By that I mean you can exercise complete freedom under loose quest and so on"
mountandblade,3cz23i,njm1314,2,Sun Jul 12 14:47:50 2015 UTC,"One thing that surprised me when I first launched Pendor was the map. I expected it to be bigger. And I fucking love fantasy maps, so that was a detractor.  Then I launched Perisno, and I instantly felt pleased. Lots of factions. Lots of map. Wolf mounts. Did I mention wolf mounts.  I haven't played much of Pendor, but I would agree that it seemed more polished than Perisno by far. I don't dislike Pendor, really, I just wasn't super excited when I first entered the world."
mountandblade,3cz23i,MushroomMountain123,6,Tue Jul 14 08:36:33 2015 UTC,"Oh Pendor by a mile. It's easily the best mod. Best fief management of all mods, the roving army/factions, the capture prisoner management feature, knighthood orders, fantastic equipment variety, awesome units, etc... Just so much to love. Not to mention the single greatest feature of any mod ever, flags over villages. A big thing is the visuals for me, Pendor looks bright and fresh while Perisno always looked kinda washed out and dark to me (a Florris base I guess?), that style of mod has always bugged me."
mountandblade,3cz23i,njm1314,2,Sun Jul 12 02:30:19 2015 UTC,Is pendor's fief management that good? I got the impression the majority of buildings only served to boost prosperity a little.
mountandblade,3cz23i,njm1314,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:34:22 2015 UTC,"Excellent. The four main things they boost are prosperity, income (mines), relations, and noble recruits plus the usual improvements from vanilla (also an auto repair building). It also allows for each fief to have it's own steward that you can train, and who can send out patrols, and gives missions. I'd say it gives the best mix of building variety, sense of accomplishment, and rewards of all the different systems I've tried."
mountandblade,3cy8c3,DuckPolica,6,Sat Jul 11 21:24:05 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's rough. I don't think it's gonna make you feel better but you get to keep whatever you have when you explicitly state you won't surrender your lands. You'll be at war with your former faction right away then.   So now you know that 'fief' can refer to a village, castle or town. Also: villages are tied to a castle or town, and will always belong to the faction their respective walled fief belongs to.   I don't know how that works but stuff you put in the chests there might still be there?"
mountandblade,3cy8c3,Orcrist9000,2,Sat Jul 11 21:56:11 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, and I lost a castle once with many weapons, you lose everything in the castle chest once it gets taken over by the enemy. I don't know if that applies to castles and towns that get stripped from you though."
mountandblade,3cy8c3,KhetdaNight,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:48:14 2015 UTC,I think when you take it back you also get the stuff back
mountandblade,3cy8c3,wooiljung,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:51:59 2015 UTC,"Well, it could be possible. The time it happened to me and I retook the castle, my chest was empty."
mountandblade,3cy8c3,KhetdaNight,2,Sun Jul 12 23:49:52 2015 UTC,"Becuase of all the troops i had in it, it's the most epicly defended castle in all of pendor  fml"
mountandblade,3cy8c3,MushroomMountain123,2,Sat Jul 11 23:59:48 2015 UTC,I highly doubt that. There's a really tough hidden castle.
mountandblade,3cy8c3,EFlagS,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:23:44 2015 UTC,You mean Elacrai or is there another one? The stronghold?
mountandblade,3cy8c3,Prometheus720,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:47:27 2015 UTC,"Wait, so in order to keep your fiefs, you can just go and tell your liege that you're leaving and taking your stuff?  I thought you had to request a new fief and declare war when they didn't give it to you, or else your only option was to leave penniless by talking to your liege."
mountandblade,3cy8c3,Windyplains,3,Sun Jul 12 06:28:15 2015 UTC,The option to talk to a king and leave your faction with all of your current holdings only exists in certain mods.  It isn't a native function of the game.
mountandblade,3cy8c3,wooiljung,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:55:41 2015 UTC,"That's only so that you get a good excuse for doing it, and take no penalty to relationships and honor. If you just go and tell the king you want to break away, you take a huge hit to relation with him and some with all other vassals in the kingdom, not to mention the drop in honor"
mountandblade,3cy8c3,Prometheus720,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:53:04 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, I see. I've been stalled out on a Gekokujo playthrough because I really don't want to lose my town but I'm very tired of being a vassal for idiots. This might be a way out."
mountandblade,3cy8c3,wooiljung,2,Sun Jul 12 12:39:54 2015 UTC,"But be careful, I think the honorable and upstanding lords took the highest relation hit, mainly because it is a 'dishonorable' thing to do."
mountandblade,3cy8c3,Orcrist9000,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:46:11 2015 UTC,Defecting from the faction after being denied a fief (and taking your current fiefs with you) is still safer imo. Going up to your king to tell him you defect might have him attack you as soon as the conversation ends.
mountandblade,3cy8c3,Prometheus720,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"Pfffft, please. I'm so OP in Geko that I need a fight like that just for the daily grind to keep my renown up. Geko makes it really easy to win battles, but hard to win wars."
mountandblade,3cy8c3,ShazbotSimulator2012,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:42:46 2015 UTC,"That worked to my advantage in my first playthrough. For some reason Ragnar loved me so much that he gave me almost everything I asked for, which not only gave me a ton of fiefs, it angered the other lords into defecting, then leaving the Kingdom after the Nords conquered their new faction, so after the Nords took the whole map I pulled out all my troops from all my fiefs and went to war, leaving him with dozens of undefended fortresses and only two other vassals. Within a matter of gamedays I had retaken the majority of the map."
mountandblade,3cy8c3,caedicus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:44:25 2015 UTC,"At least you don't have to worry about tax inefficiency any more.  I learned about tax inefficiency the hard way.  I was with the Vaegyrs had like 4 Towns, 6 Castles, 7 villages.  With my enterprises I had like 30k revenue, but between tax ineffeciency plus all my garrisons I had a net loss.  It came to the point where I was trying get other nations to attack my castles by emptying them, but I still had all these worthless villages.  In the end, I said ""fuck it.""  Decided to go independent for awhile and then joined the Rhodocks.  I now lead a much simpler life of holding 1 castle and 1 town.  Money is coming in just fine with a prosperous town."
mountandblade,3cy8c3,fanzypantz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:17:18 2015 UTC,"Why do you guys seem to want to keep all fiefs for yourself? Having a bunch of large trusth-worthy vassals armies is better especially late-game.. I always have one city, and a bunch of villages far out of reach from anyone, meaning they need to get trough a bunch of my vassals to get to my stuff. I don't need a skilled army for myself as long as I got quadruple digit man count.   Reasons:  1: more people to patrol if you give them a cluster of fiefs, like plan out who gets what.  2: more bodies during sieges and battles  3: less micromanaging"
mountandblade,3cy8c3,caedicus,2,Tue Jul 14 01:23:14 2015 UTC,"Why do you guys seem to want to keep all fiefs for yourself?   For me it was really a lack of experience with the game mechanics.  Now that I know, it's very obvious that one prosperous town is really all you need to make bank, especially if you already have a lot of productive enterprises."

mountandblade,3cxcb3,scottcitizen,8,Sat Jul 11 16:44:46 2015 UTC,"I generally do 200 in castles, 300 in towns as a minimum. Anything over that usually has to do with the place being a staging area for future invasions in nearby areas.   When I have conquered a substantial part of the map I can usually do with a small skeleton crew (100 - 120) in castles that are deep within my territory. The AI looks at numbers but also (or so it seems) prioritizes territories that they lost relatively recently, as well as territories that are close to their own.   Sometimes I put a small number of elite troops in a recently conquered frontline castle hoping that my enemies will be tempted to besiege it. Especially if it's an easily defendable place that can be a great opportunity to inflict huge casualties on a much larger force and prevent them from looting villages all over your area. Then it's like a strategic lightning rod.   This last strategy is of course really defensive and attention-consuming as you need to be able to defend the place on short notice. But I like the way it allows me to coax the enemy into a battle in which I can easily pin down and hurt vastly superior forces. It's an effective way to defend your small rogue kingdom if you have few or no vassals."
mountandblade,3cxcb3,Orcrist9000,7,Sat Jul 11 22:06:49 2015 UTC,"What Ashley said - I think you're actually a bit on the low side. Just 200 troops is not going to deter the larger coordinated armies that have the king and multiple vassals, totaling 600-800 enemy troops or more.  Keep in mind that the AI only looks at numbers of garrisoned troops, not quality. Fill your cities with level 1 recruits to inflate those numbers and it'll be a much cheaper way to convince the AI to leave you alone."
mountandblade,3cxcb3,Super_Jay,11,Sat Jul 11 16:59:49 2015 UTC,300 low-tier or mixed troops can dissuade almost all invading armies in Native Warband.
mountandblade,3cxcb3,TrotsTwats,2,Sat Jul 11 16:47:19 2015 UTC,"300 of mid-high tier troops, maybe an extra hundred in recruits"
mountandblade,3cxcb3,wooiljung,7,Sat Jul 11 19:47:47 2015 UTC,"Auto calc doesn't take rank into account, so if you are relying on the garrisons to take care of themselves it's cheaper to just have them all be low tier"
mountandblade,3cxcb3,Mephistopholees,4,Sat Jul 11 20:44:00 2015 UTC,"Wait, really? This is why low tier groups can slaughter high tier groups in autocalc?"
mountandblade,3cxcb3,Abnorc,5,Sat Jul 11 22:08:13 2015 UTC,"Yep. If you see an ally riding against a bunch of peasants, get in on it and save him from his poorly-designated fate."

mountandblade,3cxcb3,OmikronZ28,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:20:49 2015 UTC,I usually give away most of my fiefs to lords for more standing armies. And I have one large town for myself and some villages that is positioned such that they will never be able to get raided.   And I continuously always get around 200 top tier soldiers so I can refill my 200+ top-tier army. Can't afford much more if I want a ton of high man-count armies under my command.

mountandblade,3cwf8i,xaliber_skyrim,9,Sat Jul 11 10:12:55 2015 UTC,"I think ACOK has some very awesome siege scenes (difficult ones too). King's landing is very fun to siege, Norvos is a pain in the ass, but fun, and winterfell is also very nice. If you're into Game of Thrones I defenitly recommend it.   Some more amazing siege scenes in ACOK: -Bronzegate in The Stormlands -Storm's End in The Stormlands -Castlery Rock in The Westerlands -The Dreadfort in The North -The Bloody Gate in The Vale -Braavos -Dragonstone -Oldtown in the Reach -Pyke on The Iron Islands -Dragonstone"
mountandblade,3cwf8i,dutchrambo,5,Sat Jul 11 14:56:44 2015 UTC,"King's Landing was insanely easy to siege. There was a bottleneck archway between the first courtyard and the interior of the city. I just stood my men there until the only enemies left were archers, and then we charged and retreated.  However, the city brawl was fantastic, taking the wall was fun, and it was really cool to take the keep."
mountandblade,3cwf8i,Prometheus720,2,Sat Jul 11 21:02:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for mentioning the names! Is siege of King's Landing supposed to be focused only at the walls? A bit confused as /u/Prometheus720 seem to mention there is the courtyard and interior part.
mountandblade,3cwf8i,G9zoner,8,Sun Jul 12 09:33:57 2015 UTC,I personally like Gekokujo sieges. There are no towers or ladders and the maps are really nice with archer towers and chokepoints on the stairs. Most aren't really that hard to beat though but I think it's still worth checking out if you haven't already.
mountandblade,3cwf8i,Prometheus720,3,Sat Jul 11 17:15:23 2015 UTC,"They get old though, because they're all so similar. I also doubt that they're very...historically accurate."
mountandblade,3cwf8i,G9zoner,3,Sat Jul 11 21:03:51 2015 UTC,I agree with you but the same could be said of Native. I still like them because they're so different than what I was used to.
mountandblade,3cwf8i,redcandycan,4,Sat Jul 11 21:49:47 2015 UTC,"Brytenwalda offers an interesting concept with text-based pre-sieges. There are multiple things you have to do before sieging a town/castle. e.g securing your basecamp with fortifications, or building trenches for sanitary conditions in your camp. Sometimes you are able to bribe a traitor from inside the castle to open the gates. It's really fun, and I would recommend checking out the mod as a whole. One of my favorite mods."

I would love long sieges with tons of options on how to do it, with different plans for different scenarios. Maybe a castle is really well defended at the top of an hill, but it's only source of water is a river nearby. Then you could have the option to poison the river with bodies, and shit from your men. Then wait while the defenders get sick and slowly dies.  I would just like more options than two; wait or attack, as it currently stands."

mountandblade,3ctgrf,wooiljung,3,Fri Jul 10 20:37:35 2015 UTC,Ar you asking because of self promotion? I always found the policy that allows people to shill whatever on reddit as long as it isn't theirs funny. But I guess it is the difference between free advertising and word-of-mouth.
mountandblade,3ctgrf,ironplated,20,Fri Jul 10 18:08:51 2015 UTC,We are looking to properly tag and flair the accounts of mod developers to clear up any confusion that may arise.  This is also in an attempt to have these advertisements approved by the moderators beforehand to reduce spam and to stop people from using the Subreddit simply to push their wares instead of contributing positively towards the community.

I use a Tempered English Longsword on my main character, which enables me to go for the sword-and-board loadout during sieges or when I'm facing heavy archer battles, and then quickly swap my shield out and two-hand my sword for faster, higher-damage attacks. It also saves me having to reserve a slot for a one-handed weapon that I can use from horseback.  As for the armor slots and such, just look at the numbers, they're pretty straightforward. A lot of your gear decisions are based on personal preference, character build, and playstyle, so it's hard for anyone else to tell you what's ""best"" for your character."
mountandblade,3crzf4,SuwinTzi,2,Fri Jul 10 17:08:45 2015 UTC,"Well, let me rephrase then, in terms of armor, weight not taken into account, what is the absolute highest set you can (legitimately) obtain?   Another thing for bastard swords just in case you didn't know, since I just read this in a thread the other day, I think they lose a fair percentage of their damage (not sure about length or speed) when 1 handed, to the point a 1 hander would probably be better if you were aiming to use it ONLY for 1 handed."

mountandblade,3cowpt,Prometheus720,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:31:33 2015 UTC,"This is basically my laundry list for Bannerlord + story. That's fantastic. In fact, it almost looks like you've dug your way through every ""What do you want in Bannerlord?"" thread and just decided to make them yourself, just in case.  You mention that your mods, when finished, may be difficult to run on low-end machines. What's the main reason you believe that to be the case, and if the answer is textures, is there any possibility of having a low-end texture pack at some point in the future?  The hype is strong."
mountandblade,3cowpt,Orcrist9000,2,Fri Jul 10 07:26:21 2015 UTC,"Because my girlfriend refuses to make low res textures. grumble grumble    Ranger's Oath can get quite resource intensive due to the amount of calculations it occasionally has to make. Even on my rig it can get quite laggy at times, so I suspect it will be a problem on low-end machines.  I'm doing my best to optimize it, but as of now it seems quite a daunting task.   is there any possibility of having a low-end texture pack at some point in the future?   Possibly, I could also disable some of the intensive features to make it run even better. Of course, a lot of people would be upset these features are not included.  Thanks for the suggestion, I'll think about it more and see if there's a workaround."
mountandblade,3cowpt,Titus_Heldane,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:24:53 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not like it's unheard of for mods to be released in multiple versions for different audiences. You can leave all those features enabled for the people with Hardcore Master Race BattleRigsTM and leave them off in another version.  Also, if the lag you're talking about occurs in the map because of complex campaign AI, please advertise that. Other mods have had that problem (Gekokujo, I'm looking at you) and everyone got over it as long as the fights and city/village scenes didn't lag. People will make do.  If you're talking about really resource-intensive combat, that's where people will actually have problems. Laggy combat can kill immersion faster than just about anything."

mountandblade,3cnoqs,Jarbungo,6,Thu Jul 9 09:08:58 2015 UTC,"The powerdraw bonus keeps counting every point of powerdraw you have up to 4 levels above the minimum requirement of a bow. This includes all the levels below that minimum, however.  So let's say your character has 8 power draw. If he were to use a bow with 0 power draw requirement, his power draw would add 4*14% = 56% damage. If he were to use a bow with a 2 power draw requirement, his power draw would add (2+4)*14% = 84% damage. The 2 in that equation is the minimum power draw required, and the 4 is the maximum amount you can go over it.  This is only taking damage into account, though. From what I understand, bows with a higher power draw requirement tend to become inaccurate quicker than lower requirement bows. So you can hold a bow with 1 power draw requirement longer than one with 3 required. However, having additional power draw extends the time you can hold the bow steady, but only up to 4 power draw above the requirement. So that means, if you have 6 power draw, you can hold a bow with 1-2 power draw required for quite some time, but a bow with 6 power draw required will become inaccurate very quickly.   I hope that all makes sense. ^^"

mountandblade,3cp1a6,StrayedQuarreler,2,Thu Jul 9 16:57:13 2015 UTC,"it is possible.  You'll have to go into the ""resources"" subfolder of the module and find the resources for the female faces. You'll need to replace them with vanilla ones (which are found in the corresponding subfolder of the vanilla module) and maybe also edit some stuff in BRFeditor (a program used to edit resources). BRFeditor will also show you that said resources use various textures. Obviously, you'll need to delete mod textures and introduce vanilla ones into the ""textures"" module subfolder.  Additionally, you'll need to edit the skins.txt file accordingly. This file is basically a list of all face resources/textures used in the game. It's pretty self-explanatory, iirc.  I've done it myself a while back. No longer remember the fine details but it's definitely possible.  P.S. just to clarify: the word ""resource"" in M&B means basically a model, such as a human head, body or a house, for example. Any visible thing in this game is called a ""resource"". Mods introduce custom resources and this is most of the times easily reversible. Resources also have ""dependencies"", which are things that resources use to actually be visible in the game. These are textures and bump maps. So in BRFeditor you'll see the resources you're interested in (vanilla female faces) and their dependencies. That is, if the resource states it needs a certain texture to work, you'll have to put said texture in the ""textures"" folder of the mod.   And yeah, all required resources and textures are in the vanilla module so you won't need to download anything to find them. Just replace mod ones with vanilla ones."
mountandblade,3cp1a6,aleeque,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:50:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I actually had previously tried to replace the files, but I didn't know about the skin.txt file, nor about BRFeditor. You're a lifesaver!"
mountandblade,3cp1a6,aleeque,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:04:58 2015 UTC,"the skins.txt file has paragraphs in it that are basically logical blocks, so to say. I.e. men's faces go in one text block, female faces in another.  At the start of each block, there's a number. This number has to be equal to the amount of units in the text block. I.e. if you have 7 male beard models, the number needs to be 7. If you have 3 female face types, the number has to be 3.  I haven't modded anything in a long time so I only vaguely remember this, but keep that number thing in mind. All M&B text files work like this: the numbers have to correspond with the amount of resources. Also, the names of the various things in skins.txt have to be the same as resource names, obviously.  P.S. body skin color and hair color are also coded in the skins.txt file. Example: fac_manface_asian1 4290492078 1 2  fac_hair_blonde  4279702291  68451502092  here, ""fac_manface_asian1"" is the name of the resource (face mesh, in this case), ""4290492078"" is the BODY skin color code (you can't edit the head skin color because it's hardcoded into the resource). ""1 2"" are the amount of hair color variation. ""fac_hair_blonde"" is the hair mesh. ""4279702291  68451502092"" are the hair color polarities (such as from white to black, for example)."

mountandblade,3cnhv1,Aldaz108,3,Thu Jul 9 12:17:57 2015 UTC,"Well, if your playing the beta for RE(Reforged Edition) version, I know if you find the Guild Master or village elder it allows you to speak to him from the menu after. Pretty sure in the standard game they did not have this, it's a new feature in the RE version. Like mentioned before, its in beta so best waiting till its fully done as its got some bugs here and there that they are fixing.  I'd presume it'll be released sometime this month, or next.  If you would like to try the beta for RE version, head over to taleworlds here --> http://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php/topic,334273.0.html  The guide simply says this  ""Instructions for opting into the beta on Steam: (You remember that you can also use your Warband Key in steam if you bought your game from Taleworlds webpage)  In the Steam Library, right click ""Mount & Blade Warband"" and select ""Properties""  In the window that opens, navigate to the ""BETAS"" tab  In the ""BETAS"" tab, where it reads ""Enter beta access code to unlock private betas:"", enter the code reforgedbeta exactly as shown  Click ""CHECK CODE"" and upon confirmation that the beta has been successfully opted into, select ""reforged"" from the dropdown menu on the same screen  Close the window and allow the game to update  The Reforged Edition beta should now be activated  Beta savegame might or might not be compatible with the final version. Everything depends on how many and which changes we will have to do."""
mountandblade,3cnhv1,Firewind,2,Thu Jul 9 13:39:43 2015 UTC,As it stands you have to enter the village or city whenever you want to talk to a local leader or mayor. Cities can be a bit difficult but usually the mayor is near the water front or the lord's hall. In villages the leader is in a preset location.
mountandblade,3cojtj,Aerellon,6,Thu Jul 9 14:48:09 2015 UTC,Anno Domini 1257 sounds like what you are looking for.

The Eagle And The Radiant Cross is what you're looking for.  there is 8 faction and each one is really unique  -Kingdom Of Vaegir with their Guard And their Streltsi , the guard will chop your face  while their archer (streltsi) shoot your eye from distant  -Kingdom OF swadia , not really know what's up with this beside their clown-clothes look like  -Laurian Kingdom , a better and fitting clown-like clothes , really have a really really long really pike , very heavy infantry  -Imperial State , a well dressed Prussian/Germanic/Turkish man , with really good flintlock and musket , also , they like to throwing grenade everywhere  -Grand Duchy , a poor clothed avarange infantry but so damn badass hussar , they got that cool wing accessory on their back , they got that horse that run real fast than any other horse , and also they got really fancy long lance  -Ormeli Empire , its the least faction that i observe but i fought them serveral time and my conclusion is , fuk the cavalry , they heavy armored , they take your archer real fast. basically khreight , with bettter armor, and infantries.  -Haelmar Unian , a well dressed Scandifanian fellow who like to swing their axe and shoot their musket , they are no doubt the best musket in this mod  -Lion Throne , their arimies are all heavy. yes.  and also each of their king and claimant got really unique weapon so i guess that is real cool"

mountandblade,3cjaj8,relaxitwonthurt,3,Wed Jul 8 14:00:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting the original. I thought it weird that the vikings would drink apple brandy, a drink that has never (as far as I know) been popular in Scandinavia.  My French isn't very good, so I ran it through Google Translate:   Whether we serve our national drink, calvados, in the skulls of vanquished! And I want well-filled skulls!   Calvados is indeed a type of apple brandy, so the translation is technically correct, but I feel it is missing some very important context: Calvados is made in Normandy, a region where vikings settled in the 9th century and their descendants still live, which might explain why the French would connect vikings with apple brandy."
mountandblade,3cjaj8,TrotsTwats,4,Thu Jul 9 13:21:23 2015 UTC,"You are correct, as a matter of the fact the actual title of this Astérix album is 'Astérix et les Normands' and not 'Astérix and the Vikings'.

mountandblade,3cmfcn,MalaysianFlightPlann,5,Thu Jul 9 01:51:32 2015 UTC,Huh. Isn't Gekokujo supposed to be set in Sengoku Japan? Why is there only little cavalry?
mountandblade,3cmfcn,xaliber_skyrim,2,Thu Jul 9 07:23:30 2015 UTC,I didn't get far in it. It's possible there's higher level cavalry that I just didn't get a chance to see.
mountandblade,3cmfcn,MalaysianFlightPlann,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:46:19 2015 UTC,"Gekokujo does contain quite a bit of cavalry, but only beyond tier 3, so low level armies would be u equipped with little to no cavalry"
mountandblade,3cmfcn,TheTrain19,3,Sun Jul 12 16:19:57 2015 UTC,Also no shields making for a lot more fun fighting!
mountandblade,3cmfcn,slumo,9,Thu Jul 9 07:22:31 2015 UTC,"Brytenwalda is fairly infantry-heavy. Horses are made of tissue paper and generally die easily, and none of the spears/lances can be couched. Battles are focused on infantry shieldwall vs infantry shieldwall."
mountandblade,3cmfcn,SylonL,5,Thu Jul 9 02:03:08 2015 UTC,Viking conquest has very low amount of cavalry compared to native
mountandblade,3cmfcn,evergreenskate,2,Thu Jul 9 03:12:50 2015 UTC,"I know a ton of people ask this, but is Viking Conquest worth picking up? I mean I've heard it's essentially Brytenwalda but not a mod, but to me that translates to Brytenwalda but I have to pay for it."
mountandblade,3cmfcn,Firewind,3,Thu Jul 9 03:31:43 2015 UTC,"I picked VC up during the last Steam sale and it's been well worth the $10 I paid. I never played Brytenwalda so I can't compare the two. As for the dlc itself it is very focused on infantry (and those troops have to be used intelligently). In addition I don't believe any of the factions have a top tier cavalry unit.  They did a lot of things right. The cities and villages are more interesting. Trade is more rewarding. Troop have more significance. The random encounters and special locations are a nice addition. The dynamic with religion is real interesting especially once you gain a few fiefs. Also reforged is just around the corner, and a lot of new features and items will be implemented. Overall I'd say it was a marked improvement over Warband.  Only thing I really miss that VC doesn't have is the Manhunter Mace from Floris."
mountandblade,3cmfcn,Cpt_Assgrab,0,Thu Jul 9 15:51:37 2015 UTC,"I've heard that Brytenwalda has more features than the DLC because you can't profit from other peoples work, which Brytenwalda had a lot of.  I say try the mod before getting the DLC; the DLC is more polished in my opinion and some of the features you can live without (the major missing content that I can remember is Freelancer, which allows you to play as a soldier in a lords army)."
mountandblade,3cmfcn,mitchygitchy,-4,Thu Jul 9 11:26:12 2015 UTC,It really is just a nice mod with multiplayer. It's not really worth it. Napoleonic wars on the other hand.....
mountandblade,3cmfcn,Cdmbr,9,Thu Jul 9 04:21:44 2015 UTC,"This is not the answer you're looking for, but a cavalry-heavy mod that I could recommend to someone who doesn't like cavalry (speaking as someone who doesn't like cavalry) is Prophesy of Pendor. The mod has overpowered cavalry units that cover the field, but it also has strong infantry. It also has my favourite midgame weapon, called the blunt steel polehammer, which does this to cavalry. It's extremely satisfying and will leave you wishing there were more cavalry units in the game so that you could destroy them all like a deranged pokemon master."
mountandblade,3cmfcn,Cdmbr,3,Thu Jul 9 05:13:27 2015 UTC,"Man I've attempted to start up PoP like, 200 times now and I just can't do it. I like the factions, I like the lore, I like the barely fantasy setting. It's just hard as fuck to get started. Most intriguing thing for me in PoP is I read the tactical overview on the wiki, and those scorpion assassins or whatever sound awesome. Essentially just a fully offensive strike force of infantry."
mountandblade,3cmfcn,Orcrist9000,3,Thu Jul 9 05:15:46 2015 UTC,"I could give some tips to make early/mid game a breeze.  Start in Ravenstern (far north), they have very easy bandits (looter-forest bandit level) to their western regions, and then (powerful) sea raider analogues just below that. Avoid all wandering parties unless you're absolutely sure that they're not aggressive or that you can handle them. A few mercenaries are actually worth it at the start because it's nigh impossible to build a party from scratch (as you undoubtedly know). The arena payoffs are increased to 2000 for surviving and 500 for 20+ kills, which makes it a viable tactic for early game training and making cash.  Become a mercenary to your kingdom of choice as fast as you can, because the king will pay for ALL (sometimes less) of your party wages, allowing you to build ridiculously large armies for literally no cost and leaving you plenty of cash for building enterprises."
mountandblade,3cmfcn,Prometheus720,3,Thu Jul 9 05:29:45 2015 UTC,"Gotta keep your move speed around 6.5 - 7.0 to stay safe from those wandering knights of Eventide and Dawn. Or just stay away from Singal and Valonbray respectively. Avoid taking on hordes of peasants from the get-go, they will slow you down too much."
mountandblade,3cmfcn,Zarphos,3,Thu Jul 9 07:20:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not a Geko EXPERT, but I've played it a bit and the reason is that all the main factions (except one, the Ikko Ikki) have almost identical troop trees. They are split into peasant troops and samurai troops for each faction. The deviations come in the ranged units and the top and penultimate tiers of the samurai troop trees.   Some factions have gunner units while others have archers as usual Hatamoto troops are the top tier of any faction, and they can be either Cavalry or Guards. Each faction only produces one or the other   This means that some factions are very heavy in cavalry and fantastic on the field. Their horses will most likely rush your lines and fuck your formation before you've managed as much as distinguishing your massive dick (which you need to take on Hatamoto cavalry) from your sword. However, these factions are comparatively weaker in close combat and sieges because they lack the powerful guards who can kill things without swinging 10 foot poles around and hitting their own teammates.  Also, lords will often be mounted, because they think they're hot shit. However, this just makes them and their horse a prettier target for you and your beautiful gleaming musket.  I can't think of any outlaw groups that have horses, so pretty much the only mounted troops are Hatamoto cav, mounted retainers, and lords.  tl;dr Some factions have horses, others don't. It's like 50-50.  If you want to play a mod without riding a horse, Geko is a good choice except for the fact that the enemy will slowly advance to your position in formation rather than flatout charging. You may get a little bored. If you do play Geko, make sure as shit you get yourself a nice big polearm that's longer than everyone else's, because that's the ONLY way you'll protect your little samurai bunghole from horse-based, multiple-Yari penetration."
mountandblade,3cmfcn,aleeque,2,Thu Jul 9 05:55:24 2015 UTC,"If you want, I could remove horses and cavalry units from the base game."
mountandblade,3cmfcn,aleeque,2,Thu Jul 9 03:14:18 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the offer, but no thank you. The biggest thing is just the sheer advantage it gives to ride a horse, (though Floris expanded has the encumbrance system and quite a bit more not usable on horseback stuff iirc) maybe I'll just be a crossbowman and snipe things with the heaviest armor possible :D"
mountandblade,3cmfcn,Abnorc,2,Thu Jul 9 03:30:51 2015 UTC,"Actually, in Vanilla horses are only useful in field battles, and they aren't even that op there. Just play as Nords, have your infantry stand on a hill -> enemy cavalry just suicides, literally. Works every time. Remember that enemy lords do NOT stack knights, ever - they are programmed to go for mass quantities of t1-t2 units. Even Harlaus himself will only have like twenty knights at his side which is quite laughable.  And in sieges, cavalry is, of course, useless. You pay double for mediocre infantry if you stack knights. Shooting yourself in the foot, basically.  Only place where horses truly do help is the global map because you move much faster."
mountandblade,3cmfcn,aleeque,2,Thu Jul 9 04:13:03 2015 UTC,"Once you have a big enough kingdom that move speed is almost a necessity, at least to me. Though I still think it's silly half of the things you as a king have to manage, let me leave that crap to Jeremus."
mountandblade,3cmfcn,Metalwrath22,2,Thu Jul 9 04:18:40 2015 UTC,"yes, movespeed is important.  Even with this said, I still think Nords > Swadians. Simply because sieging with Nords is too easy, and sieges are the biggest part of the mid-/endgame."
mountandblade,3cmqcf,kalamadama,2,Thu Jul 9 02:47:37 2015 UTC,"I believe the only way is to give him to another lord by doing a quest.

mountandblade,3cm0oy,Deemedrol,3,Wed Jul 8 23:21:12 2015 UTC,"I don't remember if castles all have different layouts in Native, so I'll say what I can about Floris (which is similar but all the castles and stuff are different layouts for seiging)  Depending on what troops you have, I like to get a fair number of high rank Rhodok infantry (whatever kind has the tower shields but not spears, they need swords since they take the brunt of the close range attack) and then whatever archers you want. If you can find a position in the courtyard, I like to put my archers behind my infantry somewhere elevated, and then the infantry and I just hold the line to the best of our abilities.   ..Fighting on the wall is just a mess. I usually stick to shooting while my top defensive infantry guard the ladder/siege tower. Hope this helped in some way.   Actually, the other thing I remember working is if you are stuck behind your troops and have a 2 hander, you can jump and time your downward swing attack to usually hit someone over your troops."
mountandblade,3cm0oy,Jarbungo,2,Thu Jul 9 00:45:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, didn't thought I can jump and attack! I usually just stand behind their shields and pierce enemies with my 2-hander (since I can't use slash attack because of this meatwall mess).

High Training, high Surgery and Wound Treatment helps me to keep them alive, and now they're dying to some damn rookie archers because they don't have a way to hide behind their allies shield. Weird. I don't regret I joined Swadia, although I think Halarus is fucking insane, like why the hell he wardecced Khergits while Nords were beating the shit out of his own vassals and burning their villages?

mountandblade,3clbiv,Cdmbr,3,Thu Jul 9 01:59:41 2015 UTC,Buy (or loot) +2 maybe +3 leather gloves early game. Ignore gloves until everything else is basically plate after that.
mountandblade,3clbiv,Paeyvn,3,Thu Jul 9 00:50:26 2015 UTC,"In early game, you should probably be more worried about your weapons. Getting better bows (especially in mods where the accuracy stat varies) and more (and then better) arrows is a must if you play like I do. It's also worth it to buy a decent horse rather than a god damn saddle horse.  You will inevitably take damage in fights, and you will inevitably be incapacitated. Your job isn't to avoid damage (unless you don't have battle continuation), it's to be the smartest and deadliest man on the field. Your job is to pick off the most important targets with arrow or sword as quickly as possible so that your meager little army can fight another day.  In early game, your job is to carry your entire Warband. What matters most is the speed of your mount and the keenness of your blade.  tl;dr Fuck no, but in mid-game, once you're a merc and you have a little passive income, go for deals. And in late game, save up and buy the badass +12 mofos and give your old shit to your favorite companion."
mountandblade,3clbiv,Prometheus720,2,Thu Jul 9 06:11:11 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that gloves add directly to body armor instead of having their own armor section.  A mid-range armor + high range pair of gloves is likely to be cheaper than a high range set of body armor.
mountandblade,3cmf7k,AhhhFrank,5,Thu Jul 9 01:17:08 2015 UTC,"If you plan to one day start your own kingdom, I recommend reading  this tutorial once you get closer. It was written for Native, but obviously it shares lots of similarities with Floris.  As for general advice, I would recommend improving your relation with as many lords as possible and building your companions to sink skill points into. I try to leave my companions as a separate detachment placed behind my army during battles. That way, they have no chance to be knocked unconscious and their skills being temporarily unavailable."
mountandblade,3cmf7k,TrotsTwats,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:24:09 2015 UTC,Thanks! I can see why there's an appreciation thread for you =)  Great advice about the companions! I just did this and it worked out much better. Honestly didn't know them being unconscious (along with manhunters+) disables their skills!
mountandblade,3cmf7k,Jarbungo,3,Thu Jul 9 03:07:50 2015 UTC,"I've always found it's better to not go vassal right away in Floris, unless you've gotten your relation with the king up enough that he'll give you a city to cover wages. In Floris mercenary contracts are improved, and are almost guaranteed (if not guaranteed) to cover your weekly wages. So my thing is usually gather companions, do tournaments, save up cash. Then once you get the renown get hired as a mercenary, build up a massive army, get tons of cash from raiding and looting, during this send out companions to gain right to rule. Crush everything, feast in butter. GG"
mountandblade,3cmf7k,Jarbungo,3,Thu Jul 9 04:00:15 2015 UTC,Dang I already did my vassal with the Nords... I guess it's still okay. Will just start working on right to rule + building the army. The best unit in my army is an I7 Rhodok guy that I freed haha. I really hope he doesn't die...

mountandblade,3cmf7k,Star4ce,3,Thu Jul 9 16:13:31 2015 UTC,"dont vassal this early, or ever if you plan on founding your own kingdom. be a merc for a country thats at war. The nation pays your troops so that other income stream goes directly into your future war bank (starting a kingdom will empty your bank in the first few weeks so you need to have a stockpile), you also get to improve relations with other lords just as if you were a vassal, and you get to switch sides frequently without consequences"
mountandblade,3cmf7k,Star4ce,2,Thu Jul 9 12:02:06 2015 UTC,"Oh... Hmmm slight set back, I guess I'll take the rep hit with the Nords. Didn't know about not vassaling if I want my own kingdom. Got it now!"
mountandblade,3cmf7k,Star4ce,2,Thu Jul 9 16:16:08 2015 UTC,its entirely possible to rebel as a vassal. You can conquer a castle or town and ask it be rewarded to you. given your low renown you will likely be rejected. sometimes the king sends you a letter and you get the decision to either accept the your liege's decision or rebel. to have a decent chance of surviving the rebellion you will need good relations with other vassals as well as high right to rule. gathering wealth is much harder when you only have a village tho.

mountandblade,3clh71,Firewind,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:08:50 2015 UTC,"Right now stacking heavy infantry w/weapon and shield just seem to be the way to go. Archers/slingers don't do enough damage and cavalry just aren't the juggernauts they are in native(no heavily armored horses and more limited weapon options on horseback) but they still have costs as if they are.   Archers especially are pretty sad because all bows do cutting instead of piercing damage, which makes them perform poorly against armored units. Plus shields are more prevalent in VC's troop trees.  Then there's the recruitment system, it's much harder to obtain and level up standard troops, so I end up getting mostly rescued prisoners or just hiring from taverns. If you like a cohesive single faction army it's pretty harsh getting to the point where you can obtain and sustain significant numbers of troops. The lower rank ones are also pretty garbage in many cases, and some troop lines actually end up going odd directions that lead to what feels like a downgraded but more expensive unit(due to going from a good weapon to a bad one).  Plus, honestly some of the outlaw units you can obtain are better than the top tier faction troops anyway.  -- Note that I'm playing the reforged version which is an opt-in beta on steam, so things could definitely change before the reforged-ness is finalized."

mountandblade,3clj3n,Vahalla_Bound,3,Thu Jul 9 06:25:07 2015 UTC,"Writing is an important part of almost every mod (and game). When it comes to Warband, however, not many people play it for the plot.   Most people who write the dialogue also model or code as well. Because of this, it might be hard for some teams to see the appeal of bringing just a writer on board.  I recommend making some examples of what you can do and then apply to teams on ModDB with a nice application message.   Try not to undersell your abilities, but also be careful not to get in over your head with promises you can't keep.  This is a good attitude:   I can make dialogue options more meaningful to the player and the plot.    This, not so much:   I will make your mod THE BEST one for Warband with my awesome immersive MMORPG roguelike writing skills.     Having handled lots of applications and messages before myself, I recommend making sure you spell and format things well. Not only does it make it easier on those who read it, it shows you care about how you present yourself.   If you want, feel free to send me a PM and I'll be more than happy to review that application message for you."
mountandblade,3clj3n,Yalazur,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:19:05 2015 UTC,"Right. I didn't intend to try and ""make your mod the best mod"" anyway. To use Perisno as an example, there is a bit of deviation in the quality of the text. Some of it is fantastic, and some of it is...not. And sometimes, pieces of lore aren't very well supported by text, or even written at all.  I wouldn't apply to Floris, for example, because they're high profile and because they don't need me. But story-based mods like Perisno, Pendor, and ACOK need some decent writing. ACOK is probably not an option either, considering what I've heard about Cozur, but you get the idea.  I'm not really interested in money or glory, just a chance to improve myself and one of the mods I love.  If you have an idea off the top of your head of any mods like what I described, that would be a good jumping off point. I'd want to be at least familiar with their mod first.  And thanks very much for your advice!"

mountandblade,3cikxm,Leaper229,5,Wed Jul 8 04:47:29 2015 UTC,"No, I'm actually not sure there is any sort of mini mod to add this feature (please correct me if I'm wrong).    The features you listed above are actually something I've been working to implement into my own modules.   For independent commanders in battle, the player can choose any ranking member of their party to lead. I've programmed some preset behaviors which can be improved with training and morale, to give a sense of progression as your army grows in experience.   As for sending off patrols, the player can split their party in two at any time on the world map. From there, they move parts independently under a turn-based system. This will allow the player to get resources without leaving a siege, scout ahead for enemies, or bait them into an ambush.  There's some information about them on my ModDB profile, but I plan on x-posting that here shortly."
mountandblade,3cikxm,TrotsTwats,2,Wed Jul 8 07:00:32 2015 UTC,"Sword of Damocles Warlords has a feature like this, but only certain units can lead a party and not heroes."
mountandblade,3cikxm,Hazzardevil,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:08:58 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure I just saw this as a feature of another module last night. It does exactly like OP said (for the first part at least): you can split your party and the other party will be lead by your companions. You can have more parties with more Leadership skill. You can tell them to hold a position or patrol the surrounding area. It's pretty cool. But I can't seem to find the topic in my browser history. It's not Sword of Damocles btw.

mountandblade,3cikxm,xaliber_skyrim,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:57:44 2015 UTC,with auto-clac battle always resulting in way more casualty than player-commanded battles it doesnt make sense to put anything beyond tier 4 in a patrol led by generic units. one of the points of heroes leading parties is that the party can benefit from the hero's tactics skill to pose a threat to enemy lords
mountandblade,3cfufp,Lychaos,42,Tue Jul 7 16:14:23 2015 UTC,You can do wonders with a small force if you concentrate them at the ladder.
mountandblade,3cfufp,unimaginative_ID,19,Tue Jul 7 16:36:01 2015 UTC,Hopefully they fix this in M&B2. Such a broken mechanic.
mountandblade,3cfufp,notoriousmoonman,37,Tue Jul 7 21:17:05 2015 UTC,It might be a bit broken but isn't it normal for besiegers to take large amounts of losses compared to defenders? It isn't unheard of at all that a small force defended a castle against a much greater one
mountandblade,3cfufp,kslqdkql,13,Tue Jul 7 22:11:30 2015 UTC,It is unusual for the defenders to have infinite food and the attacking force to simply give up and dismantle all the siege equipment if the leader falls though.
mountandblade,3cfufp,Rowsdower11,12,Tue Jul 7 23:45:19 2015 UTC,"You can actually starve out a castle / town if you wait long enough in M&B, but no one ever does it 'cause the minimum is 30 days.  In real life, vastly outnumbered garrisons would surrender early if they thought it was impossible / no help was coming, because the harder and longer you made the siege for the attackers the more they would torture you after they broke through. Eyes pulled out and replaced with sawdust, that sort of thing."
mountandblade,3cfufp,MrWendal,3,Tue Jul 7 23:49:37 2015 UTC,"That's why I like Viking conquest. You can surround castles and towns to prevent food from entering, pillage the food from the surrounding area, build latrines, send men into the castle or town to poison the well, kill the cattle, burn the crops, that sort of thing. Granted, its all done through text event and not actuall gameplay. The defenders will even try to break your seige, and starving them out is actually a viable tactic. It's actually pretty stable now, and the reforged edition beta works awesomely at least for me."
mountandblade,3cfufp,yngradthegiant,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:24:34 2015 UTC,"I did it once, I had 50 troops versus the 200 in the castle. Just stocked up on food and starved them until the odds were more on my favor. Took forever and was boring as hell."
mountandblade,3cfufp,Alagane,9,Thu Jul 9 19:35:27 2015 UTC,"But they don't have infinite food though, 30 days seems about right, the last part is pretty stupid though"
mountandblade,3cfufp,kslqdkql,3,Tue Jul 7 23:47:57 2015 UTC,I think 30 days is too much gameplay wise. A week or two would be better.
mountandblade,3cfufp,Finnish_Nationalist,2,Wed Jul 8 08:47:36 2015 UTC,"Is there a way to change that setting? Through MBTweak or editing .txt files maybe?  Or maybe the possibility to add more options while sieging like in Viking Conquest. Poison the well, kill cattles, burn crops, etc. So they'll go down faster."
mountandblade,3cfufp,xaliber_skyrim,2,Wed Jul 8 09:22:09 2015 UTC,It might be possible. I think I remember it being lower in a mod.

Let your archers stay on ground until you think it's safe enough for them to climb the ladder."

Just have lots of archers (leave infantry in your castle or something) then have them stand outside the castle killing enemies. When the enemy is out of archers you can walk up the ladder to bait the infantry to put their shields down, and your archer can kill them. If efficiency drops, just tab out, attack again, and you'll have new enemies in stupid positions, easy to kill. Then go get your infantry and take the castle.

mountandblade,3chplb,FugueGame,4,Wed Jul 8 03:16:50 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, the faction makes a world of difference. Every faction is different, some are better at some tasks and worse at others. For example, Nords arguably have the best infantry in the game, while Swadians have the best cavalry (once again, arguable), and so on. On top of that, if you are say, a Sarranid lord fighting the Khergits, any Khergit troops you have in your army will take a morale hit.   Commands are THE BIGGEST PART of being good at single player in this game (imo).

mountandblade,3chplb,TrotsTwats,2,Fri Jul 10 10:05:02 2015 UTC,"The player party was 125 strong, but they could not all be fielded at the same time due to the size of the battle.

mountandblade,3chplb,TrotsTwats,2,Thu Jul 9 12:33:39 2015 UTC,"I'm playing Floris expanded, and I like the encumbrance feature, but I'd like to know the exact breakpoints, if strength changes it, etc etc.  Also a completely seperate question still for Floris expanded, do archers (companions and soldiers) run out of ammo? Should I give my really skilled archers 2 sets of arrows?"
mountandblade,3chplb,Jarbungo,2,Thu Jul 9 00:33:09 2015 UTC,"Archers will very often run out of ammo, especially during sieges. If you have companions built specifically to be archers, it's best to provide them with multiple quivers.  There is no way to restock your army during battle, to refill their quivers you must retreat from battle and engage again.  For your own personal supply, you can access your inventory from the small storage box when you spawn into a scene. This will allow you to refill your own quivers during battle, provided you are near spawn."
mountandblade,3chplb,TrotsTwats,2,Thu Jul 9 00:47:26 2015 UTC,"Do I need to keep more quivers in my personal supply, or will it refill my empty one when I go back to it?"
mountandblade,3chplb,Jarbungo,2,Thu Jul 9 00:48:51 2015 UTC,"It will automatically refill your quivers in Native, but some mods change this and require you to have additional quivers in your inventory."
mountandblade,3chplb,Windyplains,2,Thu Jul 9 00:52:33 2015 UTC,"1) Does floris encumbrance have breakpoints? Im pretty sure you get the skill reductions no matter what.  2) They run out of ammo, but i find the fighting companions will normally get knocked out before they use all of it, so i dont bother, but its not a bad idea to do it anyway."
mountandblade,3chplb,Windyplains,2,Thu Jul 9 00:51:25 2015 UTC,"There is something to the Floris encumbrance more than that, certain skills drop before others. For example my current character has 15 strength, and with his lighter leg armor (28.8 total encumbrance) he loses no skills, while with the heavier one (30.5) he lost 1 point of ONLY horse archery.  Just checked, 29.5 has no skill reduction either. I'm going to just quickly test if it's essentially double your strength."
mountandblade,3chplb,Jarbungo,3,Thu Jul 9 00:56:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah that is the stats of the specific item i believe. The light armour does not hurt your stats because its lighter, they wrote it in as not being cumborsome, while the heavier armour was written in to be like that.

mountandblade,3chplb,Sea_Raider,2,Thu Jul 9 01:10:56 2015 UTC,"And here I thought I edited quick enough to reword that. :)  It works fairly similar looking back at it, but applies things in a different manner.  You get the same penalty to skills, but they're weighted on a different scale than vs. a straight /10.  Not all skills should receive the same penalty based how how much movement they require.  I also expanded the number of skills impacted and then added in a movement speed component.  Your movement itself is hit by encumbrance weight, but there are basic things (such as Agility) that improve your base movement speed.  So you can go for a greater diversity of armor vs. speed options.  Silverstag Wiki: Encumbrance"

mountandblade,3ch89n,ArchAngelThomas,7,Tue Jul 7 22:00:39 2015 UTC,Wiki link  Wielding a weapon capable of one-handed/two-handed as a one-handed weapon incurs an attack speed and damage penalty of 25%. Full damage and speed are available while using it two-handed.
mountandblade,3ch89n,Solaris419,3,Tue Jul 7 22:08:54 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much a perfect answer. Generally they have higher damage numbers than one-handed weapons base, but because of the penalty then generally end up being a little lower damage than a good one-hander in the end. They have longer reach though and versatility if your shield breaks (and you have two-hand proficiencies)."

I originally thought it hit your honor too, because i had firentis and he would always complain about raiding so i never did it. Honestly raiding still isnt worth it more than one or twice to get a few enterprises set up, because you hurt the game's economy and the relationship hits are massive. To make a faction dislike you i usually rob a caravan, it doesnt make any lord or town dislike you just the faction"
mountandblade,3ci2u8,Bnlol1,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:17:32 2015 UTC,Really?  Does robbing villagers lower honour?

Some companions will come back to you over time, the others you will have to track down in the various taverns across Calradia.   can I safely stop buying food forever as long as I'm enlisted with a lord?   You can safely stop buying food, but I always tend to pick up the cheapest food possible for security. This really helps if you get captured and have to quickly raise a small party to help (or to use as fodder).   Without that food, you'll either suffer poor morale or waste time tracking down some bread.  I try to restock my food whenever the party enters a town, even if I'm not low; be careful not to get anything that will rot.    If you have any other questions, feel free to ask."

And you get decent rewards sometimes. But you don't HAVE to.  I would also say that ACOK is about exploring. Even though you've read some of the books, you probably aren't familiar with all the locations in the game. If you know exactly where Maidenpool or Volantis is off the top of your head, I question your sanity. It's a massive world with massive diversity, and the textures are too good to ignore. I had a blast by turning on Fog of War and trying to find and explore all the cities. I loved that you had to go and find guildmasters before you could talk to them.  It's definitely a great mod for roleplay, but if you just want to goof around, you can do that too."

""I will go to Altdorf now to think... this is an important step for me..."" or something like that. Lolwut.   It makes sense from a gameplay perspective to not have locked diplomacy, but it just didn't fit with the setting imo.  The Last Days is lovely though, had a lot of fun with that. Pendor is nice too.

mountandblade,3cglq6,dutchrambo,3,Tue Jul 7 19:22:02 2015 UTC,Honestly I'd say conquer some of Essos as that two day sail will probably mean none of your vassals will follow you to Westeros. If you conquer all of Essos then you won't have much difficultly conquering the whole map apart from CTD if that is still a problem.
mountandblade,3cglq6,DevilsInside,2,Tue Jul 7 23:16:16 2015 UTC,"It's definitely easier to just finish Essos first. Make sure you keep Pentos or Braavos or the southernmost one for yourself, though, as a staging point for when you attack Westeros.  The other benefit of doing Essos first is that it's WAAAAY safer to invest there because almost every faction only has one city. That means that when you go to war, you'll probably lose one source of income, not two or three."
mountandblade,3cglq6,Prometheus720,-1,Thu Jul 9 06:48:45 2015 UTC,"Id say attack Norvos, conquer all of Essos before landing in Westeros like Aegon himself!"

Aegon never conquered Essos, he abandoned it to take on the petty kings of westeros. The people of Essos, free from the newly roasted Valyrians then split into the squabbling free cities as we know them"

You guys are great company and one of the best communities I've seen on Reddit. I've met great friends, gotten into contact with lots of developers, and have found a home here. I should really be thanking all of you more than you should be thanking me.  Keep in mind that it's more than just me who does stuff here. The other moderators and prominent members of our community deserve just as much thanks as I do. Without them, this Subreddit would be a lot different too.    To answer some stuff in your post and clear up any confusion:   Yes, I get a lot of messages at pretty much every hour of the day. I love helping out though, so it's never an inconvenience. Feel free to send me messages at any time if you need help or anything. No, I do not get paid by either Taleworlds or Reddit for what I do here. I do not have any way to accept donations and I doubt anyone would be willing to anyway. I'd be willing to do an AMA, provided it's what the community wants. If that Strawpoll you put gets a lot of support then I'll schedule it for in the future. I don't need much help right now, although a graphic artist or two would be incredible. I'm trying to set up some ModDB pages for my mods, but it's hard when you have no logos or banners to work with.

Butterlord is a reference to the upcoming Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord and a bug in Floris where only butter could be plundered from villages.

mountandblade,3chps8,Windyplains,3,Wed Jul 8 00:25:46 2015 UTC,"The AI goes through a lengthy ""decision checklist"" where each lord decides what he thinks should happen with the fief.  Once he knows who he thinks it should go to then he votes on that person.  The king then sees who the popular choice is and can either go with that or can also decide to simply do what he wants.  Basically he retains the ability to veto the majority vote if he doesn't like that person much or likes someone else better.  At some point I should go through it line by line and convert it into a logical thought process in English."

mountandblade,3cdipf,Yalazur,3,Tue Jul 7 09:27:51 2015 UTC,"Just posted some badass stuff at Bardaq Castle yesterday, but the tougher part of the war with Sarranid was the capture of Bariyye.  There was no one to accompany me (Harlaus isn't the only one who love his feast) so I had to go 80 vs 250s in Bariyye. I recall their archers numbered almost 100s so I have to clean them first before break through their defense. So before I climbed the ladder, I told all my units to follow me, kept a safe distance from enemy archers (keep moving left and right to minimize the impact of arrows), and got them to shoot all the visible enemy archers at the walls. After the visible archers went down, I told my archers to hold the ground just a few meters before the ladder.  Then I told my cavalry - the tanks in my army (a few Swad Knights, some Mamlukes, some Lancers, and some Sword Sisters) - to climb the ladder and open the way. The infantry, the bulk of my army, waited with me for a while until most of the cavalrymen/women climbed the ladder. After that I climbed the ladder with them and told the infantry to charge.  At this point I jumped over the enemies, tried not to get caught in those vast number of people, and slipped into their back. I told the cavalrymen/women to follow me and hunted every archers hiding in the distance and towers. The cavalrymen/women can't jump so it took a while before they get to follow me.   That period of waiting was hell.  As soon as I got into their back, some of those archers somehow changed their attention to me and I was spammed with plenty of arrows. My shield got destroyed fast and I have to move swiftly back and forth to nearby archers to reduce the fire and to dead footmen to get new shield. I don't have the best defense (only 3 points in Ironflesh) but I can run quite fast. I really thought I was going to die and I know if I died things will go bad.  Fortunately, my cavalrymen/women came right in time. They crushed the archers in no time and with me they hunted those pests to every bits of them. Then we came back to help the infantry and the glory was ours.  I barely survived."

mountandblade,3cagvt,FayeGrimm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:57:29 2015 UTC,"I actually enjoy playing on normal damage now. I guess I played too long on 1/4 but now doing even a single battle no matter how cheap it would feel to lose it (like getting ambushed by a company of fast moving mounted knights after a huge hard fought combat where you have only 6 out of 70 troops combat ready) feel like I'm cheating and makes me feel like the run I'm currently in is now worthless.   I've done my share of easy mode mix ups like full on retard ctr+alt+f4 at the start to capture a city and a lot of lords from day 1; only cheating the levels and level up all my characters to level 45 at day 1 with the most expensive armor and weapons (plus something like 4 or 5 companions with 10 on training to make peasants into knights overnight); playing on min damage settings ""until I feel like I'm on the same ground at the others"" meaning until I have a castle and a city, etc.  I don't know. Maybe I'm the minority but it really feels a lot more fun to me to be riding ahead of my troops charging like a legendary commander into battle and suddenly a siege crossbow nails me in the head killing me in a single hit. My troops—now in panic without a commander—begin a charge like idiots at the enemy.To me that makes things more immersive. Like, you wouldn't really lead the charge unless you were confident that you would live to tell the tale. Lately I've begun to sit a bit far in the back dictating orders depending on the need of that particular battle. Feels awesome in another way, but I guess this would only appeal to those more into strategy rather than hacking and slashing.   Something that is really cool actually that occurred to me while writing this to go all full Caesar. During the Battle of Alesia at one point Caesar had to drag any available soldiers left using them to help at points of the battle where he was about to lose.  I now realize it would be incredible to do this. Bind 4 or so Red Brotherhood Guilds-men and 4 or so Rogue Knights into a separate hotkey and at the points of the battlefield where your troops are doing poorly, you pick your handful of cavalry and go to reinforce them. Ah! I've got try this now."

Factions are locked in diplomacy so they can't actually declare war on other factions without being scripted to do so, even if you attempt to instigate a war. Which is one of the big flaws in ACOK imo. You can just become a vassal to any faction you choose, go off to a fief of a faction you're not a war with, take it, and they won't ever be able to retake it because they're 'not at war' with the faction you're a vassal of.

mountandblade,3cc59z,Dredy4,9,Mon Jul 6 19:35:50 2015 UTC,"Guild Masters in towns inside your faction sometimes come up with quests to make peace between your faction and another. This entails making sure that two lords, on on each side, do not object to making peace.   Apparently you can try persuading these lords to stop blocking the peace process. If that doesn't work, you can imprison them until peace is made. I don't know anything detailed about these quests because I've never finished them. Just go talk to some Guild Masters, I'd say.   Other than that, there's not really anything you can do other than wait it out. What u/Cdmbr says is true, but looking at your territories I'm guessing your faction is under attack from every direction and your lords are spent and overstretched. There needs to be some degree of peace (or at least less war) for your faction to regain strength economically and militarily.   However you don't need to sit on your ass, you can generally help the odds of peace being proposed by beating the crap out of the other factions. There is some sort of internal logic in the AI's strategic thinking, and if they suffer too many losses for too little gain, they will ask for peace to prevent further asskicking.   So focus on a faction, beat their armies up, capture their lords as much as possible, break the sieges they initiate, prevent them from winning battles and looting villages, et cetera. Be as agressive as you can in a way that is sustainable. I'd say your army could do that at this point.   Your faction is bound to take some territorial losses because the gains just aren't consolidated in such a short time. So be it. Once you have made peace with one or two faction you'll get back at them with a vengeance."

You will want to put your highest tiered troops at the top.   As to your question about positioning during defense, there isn't much you can do. Infantry and cavalry are usually placed somewhat near the siege tower entry point and ladders on the walls. Archers are sporadically placed along the walls and in the towers. Your best bet is to select cavalry and infantry (Shift+1 then Shift+3) and tell them to hold position right at the siege tower entry point or the top of the ladders. Archers are usually in the best position they can be anyways."

mountandblade,3cd6jk,Vahalla_Bound,2,Wed Jul 8 06:04:35 2015 UTC,Correct
mountandblade,3cd6jk,Swayingorb786,2,Wed Jul 8 10:37:29 2015 UTC,The padded slaver armor can add like 30 body armor with minimal encumbrance.
mountandblade,3cd6jk,Swayingorb786,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:48:07 2015 UTC,"Oh man yeah, I noticed just how insane that armor was a couple weeks back for the weight. How heavy of a horse would you recommend? A full on warhorse, or should I stick with still upgrading my riding skill but staying with a riding 2 or 3 light horse?"
mountandblade,3cbf77,Vahalla_Bound,2,Mon Jul 6 16:30:35 2015 UTC,You can try to copy the data folder from the decapitation mod and pasting it into the Floris mod folder.
mountandblade,3cbf77,testikron,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:50:09 2015 UTC,Could this work?  Or would it fuck everything up?  I'm genuinly curious now.

mountandblade,3cbf77,testikron,3,Mon Jul 6 19:58:26 2015 UTC,"keep the folder open, test it out.  If it doesn't work, use the ""Undo move"" should be fine.  That's how I merged a lot of mods using another game from Steam."
mountandblade,3cbf77,Hergyl,2,Mon Jul 6 21:16:44 2015 UTC,I did exactly this. Good thing too because I fucked up lel.
mountandblade,3cbf77,Hergyl,4,Mon Jul 6 21:33:19 2015 UTC,You're right. I won't know for sure unless I try.  Like that time my friend Michael dared me to jump from a 20m high rock into water and I hit my back on the rocks because it was a river. A ton of painkillers and a few months later I learned a valuable lesson I would've never figured out unless I broke my back like Batman's back broke against Bane's knee: Friends can be jerks sometimes.
mountandblade,3cbf77,wooiljung,3,Mon Jul 6 20:06:06 2015 UTC,"maybe it's just me, but common sense dictates that we shouldn't jump from 20m high"
mountandblade,3cbf77,Hergyl,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:06:58 2015 UTC,Common sense doesn't speak as loud when you've downed a couple dozen beers.
mountandblade,3cbf77,EFlagS,-3,Mon Jul 6 21:32:18 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't decapitation be a bad thing? I though it was a problem in native where lords would go into exile during the late game which was a problem.   There are only so many troops you can field yourself and you can't be everywhere at once.   Also killing all the lords of an enemy faction would feel a bit exploit-y. It would be really easy to win the game that way.   Unless that is, that the house heirs would take up the reigns and take command of their dynasty. That would be pretty cool. Of course you would get HUGE relations penalty with that family, and with the families affiliated to it too. Probably with all the lords of the realm too because they would see you a someone without honor, as it is custom of the realm to threat aristocrats fairly and only held them hostage for ransom.   This would be a cool and interesting mechanic. You would basically have to balance whether or not the relations and honor penalties outweigh the benefits, which in their own way are pretty interesting too. The current lords of the realm have seen their share of battles—they are men with experience on managing their fiefs, leading men into battle, and fighting in of itself. Beheading a lord would mean that someone with less experience has to rise to the occasion. Someone that probably was not ready to do it, who did not expected to do so for many years now... someone who is probably not respected...   Now leading the armies of your enemies are men with poor leadership skills that maybe can field 50 or so troops  max. Men with poor stats that would prevent them form using the top notch armor and weapons that other in their position would use.   It also makes the game more interesting politically. Not only are familiar relations more important (maybe you want to kill the lord of a big city, so that his inept son takes over, but his brother is still alive making a previously fiefless lord now a real threat), but it could open maybe some interesting quests:  Imagine that you do not want to take the relations and honor penalties, well maybe with some political intrigue you could forge evidence compelling enough that the king would simply have to behead the guy himself.   Maybe there could be a another mini path were you are hired as a personal retainer to a lord. You are not a vassal of the ream per se but an agent. Someone that does the dirty. I imagine the quest progression to the like of the Knighthood Orders quests in Pendor where you do increasingly dark stuff until at the end you can freely kills lords at will. Shaping the political landscape of the land and however you saw fit through the league of assassins you have created.   Something really cool would be that maybe the final quest is that the Noldor (giving that you are really friendly with them) give you access to a transformation potion that lets you take place of a lord after you have killed him... and just maybe... even a king."

mountandblade,3caw9y,njm1314,2,Mon Jul 6 18:34:09 2015 UTC,Yeah it makes leveling it up actually useful. At a point pretty every battle you win means you capture the enemy Lord.

mountandblade,3caw9y,TrotsTwats,5,Mon Jul 6 14:05:15 2015 UTC,"It would not be cheating, as you could easily roleplay it out. For example, you can set a rule to increase it by 5% for every x Denars you invest somewhere.  Having the option to increase your chance is nice, but I believe the approach in Warband was to extend play time and increase the difficulty for the players."
mountandblade,3caw9y,Abnorc,3,Mon Jul 6 14:13:34 2015 UTC,"You could, but it would make for a good in game feature. Maybe they'll iron out this detail in Bannerlords. Like agility can determine this or something. Maybe you can have a stealth stat that affects things like this."

mountandblade,3caw9y,bobothemonkeyboy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:12:56 2015 UTC,"Blunt weapons increase the amount of enemies knocked unconscious rather than killed.  I don't know whether this applies to lords, but it seems to.  I have a campaign going right now where I have an entire army of Manhunters and when every battle is over I will have something like 75% or so captured enemies (tons).  You can command your regular troops to only use blunt weapons as well, but I don't know if that is as effective as all those slaver troops."
mountandblade,3caw9y,Bnlol1,3,Mon Jul 6 21:03:01 2015 UTC,"Lords are never killed, no matter what weapon you use they are knocked unconscious.

mountandblade,3ccd38,mitchygitchy,4,Mon Jul 6 20:55:16 2015 UTC,I've been having this same problem. Do you have to have a certain amount of relationship with the king in order to be able to ask to become his vassal?   My renown is almost at 500 and I still haven't been able to ask anyone to become their vassal.
mountandblade,3ccd38,SeryaphFR,2,Mon Jul 6 21:01:02 2015 UTC,"Yea exactly, the option to ask him has never appeared :c"
mountandblade,3ccd38,mitchygitchy,2,Mon Jul 6 21:03:44 2015 UTC,"It seems you first need to be a mercenary for your faction first, which is unique to Viking Conquest. You can become a mercenary by asking all the current vassals of the faction for a task till one of them gives you the mercenary task. From there you should be able to ask the king for vassalage."
mountandblade,3ccd38,Vandeco,2,Mon Jul 6 21:05:19 2015 UTC,"Hello there! Are you playing story mode or sandbox mod? In sandbox mode, becoming a vassal works just like vanilla, just earn some renown. However, in story mode the option of joining a faction as a vassal is blocked. Hope it helps!"

What you can do is order them to follow you. Then, you make sweeping counterclockwise passes on the edge of their formation. This allows your cavalry to quickly hit then pull away in pursuit of you. As the army shifts to block the incoming horses, your archers will have a nice opening.  You must be very quick to not allow your men to get tangled up in the enemy lines. This can involve adjusting your course or even doubling back to pull them from combat."

Once we slam into the lines and scatter some infantry in the initial shock, I issue the 'Follow Me' order again so my horsemen will pull themselves out of the melee before getting too surrounded. It helps if you ride off to the flanks and have them follow in a perpendicular direction to the infantry's facing, so they aren't trying to push through the ranks directly.

I think you have to get the prisoners from fiefs though, if you defeat an enemy party that holds Noldor prisoners you don't get the chance to take them as yours (if I remember well).   Or I suppose you can fight Noldor parties and try to get as many prisoners as possible to free later, but Noldor parties are no joke."

mountandblade,3c8rhb,LoyalTerranRepublic,5,Sun Jul 5 23:30:00 2015 UTC,"I've found the best infantry are Sell-sword Halberdiers. Just recruit those cheap sell-swords from the free cities and train them up. The second best infantry I've found is the Stormlands troops. They get a massive 2handed hammer, which can help you knock out troops. For cavalry I recommend The Reach Knights. They are extremely good at high level but tend to die a lot whilst you train them. If you have the coin you can skip half the training by just buying them at Reach cities. There's some good cavalry in White Harbour too. You get 10 of them.  For archers, I haven't found anything that's caught my eye apart from Myrman crossbowmen, you get them in the Port of Myr. The Reach get crossbowmen too but I don't like them as much. The North's archers haven't got the accuracy of other troops but have a much faster fire rate so it kind of evens out. All of the other factions have nothing special, just standard longbowmen except for Dorne which has javelin throwers."
mountandblade,3c8rhb,Arcnull777,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:38:24 2015 UTC,The archers of the Dornish Marches are also excellent archers.  They're found in the castle of Nightsong in the Stormlands.

mountandblade,3c8rhb,Arcnull777,3,Mon Jul 6 04:43:31 2015 UTC,This may not be correct so don't rely on it too much.  North: Weak all around nothing strong about them. Fairly sure their infantry is the weakest in the game.  Vale: fairly sure they have the strongest Knights in the game. But of course they don't really go to war so it might just be good to recruit there  Westerlands: medium with if I recall good archers.  Iron islands: best infantry in the seven kingdom's.  Dragonstone: medium all round but not many places to get troops and seems to have the dumbest Ai.  Stormlands: medium not too great in anything infantry might be weak?  The reach: no idea honestly Dorne: again not much of a clue but they do have the more interesting troops and imo the best looking troops.  Essos: all the same good troops but expensive. Best infantry is unsullied but expensive lightly armored and if caught in a choke hold fall pretty quickly.
mountandblade,3c8rhb,DevilsInside,3,Sun Jul 5 23:43:16 2015 UTC,"The retainers are not what they once were. They're non two-handing units max out at around 44 armor(they wear mail) whereas a Vale sergeant goes in with full plate 52+ and their roundshields even have lower HP and resistance than dornish roundshields. Plus, their axes are lower damage than an arming sword for the most part.  I had an army comprised of veteran retainers and vale serjeants and the CHEAPER serjeants died far less often and seemed to kill more troops. Their stats are even fairly comparable, with the retainers just having a bit more ironflesh and shield skill   Unsullied suffer from the same problems, too little armor, too weak shields"
mountandblade,3c8rhb,Gen_McMuster,3,Mon Jul 6 03:59:14 2015 UTC,"Not going to include Sellswords or Unsullied just because you asked for factions.  Infantry: Ironborn for the shield guy, acts like a Nord Huscarl. Stormlands Hammerman for a 2h guy.  Cav: The Vale and The Reach are sort of a 1a 1b sort of deal.  Crossbow: The Reach, hands down  Archers: Targ. They are deadly with that longbow, and heavy armor means they are more effective if forced into melee combat than other archers.  Westerlands and the North are okay all around, they just don't shine in any area, Stormlands and Dragonstone are similar just slightly better. Dorne is pretty rubbish in my experiences. The top 3 all around factions in no particular are The Vale, The Reach, and House Targ."

Quoting myself from a while back:   Just a wild fantasy of mine: there could be a quest in which you could ""murder"" the King, Caesar-style. You convince a couple lords to join the murder plot, and at the next feast of the faction you can trigger a quest in which you and the other plotters have to fight through a handful of honor guards and then you kill the King. ""Tu quoque, <player name>?""  Maybe it's not necessary to actually murder him, the outcome of the quest could be that the king flees Calradia and never returns, as if their faction was destroyed.  The new ruler of the faction will then be the player, as he initiated the quest in the first place. However whether or not the other lords that were not in on the plot will accept you as the new king has yet to be seen of course.  The faction can then split up into the original faction and a ""loyalist"" faction of lords who stay true to the old king. Civil war!!   Another thing that would be nice is maybe some kind of bragging mini-game, so that you can bring up memories of battles that took place earlier. If they like you enough / your renown / persuasion is high enough, then the other lords recognize your heroism and you gain relation points. If they think you're full of shit, you lose points."

mountandblade,3c6b97,Windyplains,9,Sun Jul 5 16:08:31 2015 UTC,"Not all of these are realistic - or would necessarily fit with the game - but I've been throwing them around in my head for a while trying to think of ways to make feasts less static.   Let you have private conversations about values/kings at feasts, instead of making you track lords down a league away from their friends. A feast is the perfect opportunity to discover lords' natures, dig up dirt, and maybe even quietly build sympathy for your own cause. This is the biggest one, because it's a small change that makes a lot of sense to me. Maybe throw in the 'mutual interests' missions as well, so you can scheme to and then denounce a lord without ever leaving the feast. It makes having lots of lords in the same place actually useful, which it should be. A conversation system along the lines of Pendor's rumour system. Mostly just filler text/gossip, but occasionally a conversation could lead to something genuinely useful - even just taking a few soldiers off another lords' hands, or a high quality weapon they had commissioned. Enough to encourage you to sometimes attend feasts and talk to lords, if you wouldn't otherwise.   More complex/distant wishes:   Imprison guests. Finally find a use for the guards you have at the door - they're always asking for something to do. Massive all-round relations hit, lose honour and maybe right to rule, etc. Useful for kings with troublesome vassals, or maybe in mods where foreign lords will occasionally visit feasts (Brytenwalda?) Let rivalries escalate, along the lines of the belligerent drunks in taverns. If you have bad enough relations with a lord - and say, you two and the lady you're both pursuing is there - maybe you'll get into a punch-up and both disgrace yourselves. I hadn't originally considered a coup, but I really like the idea, the more I think about it. Instead of rebelling when you're denied a fief, or besieging a castle while you're independent, there's now a third, premeditated way to go independent. You could imprison anyone present that's a threat and start the civil war with a big advantage, with obviously huge consequences. Maybe lesser penalties if you launch the coup in the name of a claimant, rather than for yourself.   I don't know if you think any of those would be realistic or even positive additions to the game, but given your modding experience I'd love you hear what you think!"
mountandblade,3c6b97,shibaizutsu,7,Sun Jul 5 13:46:26 2015 UTC,"Private conversations unlocked - relatively easy.  It makes sense to an extent as well for improving the usefulness of feasts.  There are always going to be whispered conversations in a corner.  Conversation System - not difficulty to implement as random filler as long as a list of dialog was generated.  If you wanted actual context to the filler, such as including game events then the game event log would need to be checked for relevant info.  That gets a little trickier, but doable.  Seems worth it though.  Imprison guests - This is doable, but I wonder how good of an idea it would be in reality.  Yes, you have more lords there to potentially help or witness you exert your power, but you're also breaking a sense of hospitality.  The other lord came under an unspoken agreement to peace and protection and you're violating that.  Your other vassals would take note of it as well.  Rivalries - I think having two AI lords get into a argument and have that generate a dueling match would be interesting.  Civil War - Doable.  It'd make for a hell of a scene with a sudden battle of fists.  The funny part is that those door guards would be the primarily armed opponents while most of the lords would likely have nothing more than daggers.  That sounds fun to implement.  They're all viable options and I think would be fun.  I'll have to think on it."

mountandblade,3c6b97,Antruder,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:22:29 2015 UTC,Feasts are very useful for getting support from lords to you getting a recently conquered fief. Feasts are also often held when a big campaign has just ended. Get ALL the support!

mountandblade,3c8csd,Abnorc,2,Sun Jul 5 21:18:41 2015 UTC,I've found that it does. Problem is the Kings keep indicting lords which lowers relation with all of lords so they indict more.
mountandblade,3c8csd,MenelausTheScripter,2,Sun Jul 5 22:30:04 2015 UTC,It's a self-perpetuating issue. I think the only way to solve it is to rule the world with an iron fist.

mountandblade,3c8csd,yngir,2,Mon Jul 6 03:17:41 2015 UTC,"It's something that always happens in Native in the long run. Kings hand out fiefs to vassals they have good relations with. In many cases a close circle of friends forms around the king and they get all the fiefs. The other lords outside of that circle get angrier and angrier with the king with every fief he gives to the lucky few, making it even more unlikely they will ever get a fief from that king. So they defect or get kicked out at some point.  It's very unlikely they will get into the 'inner circle' of another faction, where the same process is taking place. Native invariably moves to what is informally called the 'Vassal Hat Dance' on the forums.   In your case with Swadia it is particularly bad because that nation is always under attack from all sides, making the lords lose relationship with Harlaus even faster (which also causes the many feasts that Harlaus the Glutton is famous for).   This dynamic is what made me turn my back on Native pretty quickly. Most mods I've played so far do a pretty good job at mitigating this dynamic."
mountandblade,3c8csd,Orcrist9000,2,Mon Jul 6 09:18:08 2015 UTC,"Its certainty a growing annoyance that I share. I really oddly enough enjoy native more than any other, but sometimes 100 days into a game Kingdoms just implode. And then you get the mass defections, leading to a very messy map.   The one time I actually managed to avoid this, was by joining a faction early, marrying asap, supporting the King 100% and using the wife's quests to mend bridges between the King and his vassals. We had a solid kingdom. Then half of Swadia and the Sarranids defected to the Vaegirs and I ragequit."
mountandblade,3c8csd,yngir,2,Mon Jul 6 10:16:21 2015 UTC,"The scattered, nonsensical map and running into sheikhs named Olaf and Harald and jarls named Aziz and Ahmad (or whatever those Sarranid are called) killed my immersion tbh.   What you say about staving off this dynamic by doing wife quests is quite interesting, it shows there's really some influence there.  Regardless, I enjoy the mods that have some more built-in stability. The only drawback to that is that lords can be really, really loyal as long as their kingdom isn't getting demolished. In Floris the only way I could get high-value lords with good personalities to join me was when their kingdom was reduced to one or two fiefs. And then it was still hard. In Pendor it seems to be the same.   I'll have to scrape by with companion-vassals until then."
mountandblade,3c8csd,Orcrist9000,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:40:55 2015 UTC,"I'd much rather take that over the native's situation, but neither is ideal. I'm using TweakMB to fiddle with the relationship numbers as I'd prefer to keep my game as native as possible, but there seems to be unseen ""thresholds"" that can cause some ridiculous things to happen.   For example, if you give +relation to all lords when a fief is handed out, and for whatever reason they still hate the King, or the faction is destroyed, then there are mass defections because they're all friends and they follow each other around. When Swadia gets 10 new lords over the space of a month... yeah. Suddenly it makes the old system far more appealing.   Actually, if I could just change all the starting relationships between vassals and Kings to be 100 that might mitigate enough... or at least hold it off until late game (except for Haringoth who needs to be seen for the traitor scum he is)."
mountandblade,3c8csd,yngir,1 point,Mon Jul 6 10:53:13 2015 UTC,"It just came to my mind that you can actually use the Native system to your own advantage when you rule your own kingdom. If you read up on how the process works then you can act smarter than the other kings, such as by only taking on lords with good personalities, handing out fiefs equally instead of just to your friends, and good military leadership in wartime.   The only kingdom in Native that has a hope to be stable is the player's. That would give you an edge over the other kingdoms that are embroiled in constant infighting."
mountandblade,3c8ims,Wooper160,3,Sun Jul 5 22:08:34 2015 UTC,"You follow the instructions they gave you, or you do it the same way you did the mod. Since you've been very un-specific."
mountandblade,3c70e6,conrick617,9,Sun Jul 5 13:33:50 2015 UTC,"For starters, I'd say to begin fielding a large garrison. Perhaps drop about half of your army into Weyyah Castle, and begin raising relation within surrounding villages, to allow for rapid recruitment of soldiers that may have some training. At about 30 reputation, you can get 1-2 dozen T1 troops, or about a dozen T2. For Nords, that could mean a dozen footmen from each village, allowing for quick raising of armies, for the same cost as recruits. Once you have that infrastructure, not only can you afford to take losses and keep your castle defended, you can nigh instantly raise an army out of Weyyah Castle for whatever purpose you need it for. Raise your personal military might, gain income, and prepare for one of two things: Stomping out your enemies, or creating your own faction. Otherwise you will likely continue fighting against those that war with you, and the game may stall."
mountandblade,3c70e6,SnipahzMcLeod,2,Sun Jul 5 15:04:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, I didn't know that you could get more than about 6 recruits out of a village. I have two questions though, what is the most reasonable amount of troops I can expect to have by endgame, 150? And is that enough to take on the huge dog-pile of 500 vassals that sometimes happens? Secondly, is my army composition good? I currently carry around with me 15 huscarls, 10 swadians Knights, 6 good companions, 10 khergit veteran horse archers and the rest a mix of Rhodok sergeants and sharpshooters. I think for a garrison I'm going to go with pure Rhodok sergeants and sharpshooters to hold my castles since they get boosted morale from my good relation with the faction, and they're good at holding castles. I'll keep the various other factions troops as my personal army along with whatever rhodoks I'm training up at the time."
mountandblade,3c70e6,SnipahzMcLeod,2,Sun Jul 5 18:31:21 2015 UTC,"My personal preference is for Nordic huscarls, and a high surgery skill. Ensure they don't die, and they will treat you well. I believe my character is capped at about 70 troops, and I'm at 200 days in on this character, Jarl McLeod. I try to support my men during sieges, and involve myself in the political systems of the game, and have begun trying to raise my honor by playing catch and release with Swadian lords. It's like fishing. Just need to be patient, then strike.   You have a decent mix of soldiers, but I'd make sure you micromanage with it. The only troop I don't like would be the Khergits, but I'm just biased. Nothing beats a Nordic shield-wall, with a group of axe-wielding archers behind it. With 150 troops and proper management, I don't see why you couldn't face off against 500, depending on the enemy composition. All top tier troops? You may be in for a bad time. If they are the usual mix, composing large numbers of ""chaff"" units like recruits and militia, then by all means, PREPARE THE MEATGRINDER!!!"
mountandblade,3c70e6,SnipahzMcLeod,2,Sun Jul 5 19:32:53 2015 UTC,"Haha so far my favorite memory in this game at about day 300 is when we had just taken curaw but count laruqen left a bad garrison of only about 20 so my 70 men and those 20 holed up in the city and killed 400 men in a counter attack. For some reason the vaegirs brought very few archers so all we had to do was slaughter them once they stepped off the ladder. I leveled up twice. It truly was the meat grinder. Good idea though I think I will try to add some more huscarls to my army, fewer Rhodok sergeants. I like having a few khergits to take on skirmishing hit and run missions, just like I like to have swadian Knights around to take on line busting missions. Just enough so we can actually make a dent. I might lower the number down to 5 though and raise my swadian count. I want to pick up Jeremus for that awesome surgery skill but artimenner has turned into a beast under my tutelage, and I know he'll leave if I get Jeremus, not to mention his instant siege ladders almost."
mountandblade,3c70e6,DenouncedLord,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:01:08 2015 UTC,"As far as removing the Khergit archer cavalry, I'd suggest replacing them entirely with the Swadian Knights. They are plenty durable, and will be able to do a lance sweep and pull back just fine in my opinion.  The Rhodok sergeants aren't all that bad actually, but my main preference is for Huscarls, the only tier 6 infantry in the game. Ymira isn't a bad replacement for Jeremus. Just remember, you can always build up a surgeon from another character. My character is the main surgeon in my playthrough, with stats to be a horse archer or shieldwall warrior as well. Having a spare in the back lines allows you to go into battle without fear of losing your main medical unit. Redundancy is key."
mountandblade,3c7amb,master_heklep,14,Sun Jul 5 15:31:22 2015 UTC,"The cavalry part is not possible because troops always line up with the broadside of their shape towards the enemy.

mountandblade,3c7amb,Ztiller1,4,Sun Jul 5 15:59:10 2015 UTC,"Yes that is what I usually do, however, I want both my infantry and archers in different columns so that they aren't as spread out.

mountandblade,3c6c1n,Cyntheon,5,Sun Jul 5 06:33:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, correct choice made.  No bias here.  Floris: We stopped development on Floris about two years ago and it will not resume again until we rejoin for Bannerlord.  The rest of the team stopped modding so with just me left, I chose to develop Silverstag instead.  It is still receiving updates, I'm just had not been doing them as often.  The last ""stable"" release was v0.25 in December, but I just put out a v0.26 dev release (it is not stable) four days ago for folks to help me polish it up a bit.  WSE: WSE has stopped further development, however, the version of it that is packaged with Silverstag can run on any version of warband 1.153+.  It requires version 1.153 to function, but if you're running a later version then it will revert warband back to 1.153 on its own (this isn't permanent).  So you could run a steam copy with the latest warband version and it should still work as long as you're starting the game with the WSE loader application vs. using steam."

mountandblade,3c4chq,sdkegg,17,Sat Jul 4 17:32:55 2015 UTC,With a shield they glance so freaking easily and can be blocked so easily with a down block. This doesn't fit how they were actually used at all.
mountandblade,3c4chq,PurplePeopleEatur,3,Sat Jul 4 18:58:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you don't have a shield a spear is quite a hard weapon to block since it thrusts and its long they could aim it anywhere. If you think about it how would you deflect a stab, you can't block it like a swing you would have to try knock it out the way or dodge it."
mountandblade,3c4chq,Urban_Viking,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:19:49 2015 UTC,"I'd also like to add that the spear is completely fucking useless unless you're thrusting i.e. the pointy end only exists when you click your mouse button. If someone sprints towards me and my spear is pointing at them, they should be impaled, but in M&B they just clip through it. Spears were effective because they kept people away from you."
mountandblade,3c4chq,Duke0fWellington,2,Mon Jul 6 09:37:29 2015 UTC,"If this is an issue, as you are being hugged by AI, then I would recommend using a kick in order to land a hit with the spear and shield."
mountandblade,3c4chq,MildlySuspiciousBlob,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:17:32 2015 UTC,"That's still a little unrealistic, or at least, un spear-like. You have a 3 inch wide sword, and somehow it blocks an inch in diameter spear?Wouldn't the spear slip off the sword, metal against metal, and stab the defender anyway? Coludn't you just thrust somewhere else?"
mountandblade,3c4chq,BostonTentacleParty,2,Sun Jul 5 06:12:33 2015 UTC,"Not certain how this links to kicking. However, I think in this sort of case you have to make an allowance for the game's combat system taking precedent over realism. An extra dimension of blocking may add realism to the game, but it wouldn't increase the skill cap of the game or the enjoyment received from the game. Thus I think it was in Taleworlds' best interests to give spears bonuses in other areas."
mountandblade,3c4chq,poptart2nd,2,Sun Jul 5 07:25:33 2015 UTC,"Nah. Deflecting thrusts with a sword isn't actually as difficult as you're making it out to be. At least, parrying sword thrusts isn't. Spear thrusts aren't so different, though I'd bet feinting is easier with a spear than most swords."
mountandblade,3c4chq,Livto,44,Sun Jul 5 15:18:15 2015 UTC,"the issue that I personally have with spears is two-fold:   1) spears are meant to be a counter to cavalry because you can plant the spear in the ground and the horse will impale itself on it. This mechanic does not exist in any capacity in vanilla warband. the closest analogue is if you time your thrust perfectly, it will deliver extra damage to the horse, but not nearly enough to be an effective counter, and the AI doesn't do it well enough to be any advantage anyway. it has the potential to act like couched lance damage, but the dev team didn't include that when they were making the game.  2) anything that a spear does, another weapon does better. it doesn't have the highest piercing damage in the game, it isn't particularly fast, and you can only stab with it. Also, if an enemy gets too close, your spear is next to useless. the only advantage spears have is if you actually have a lance, because those deliver couched lance damage. its extra reach isn't enough to justify its drawbacks, especially when you consider its historically main use is all but eliminated within the mechanics of the game."
mountandblade,3c4chq,poptart2nd,16,Sat Jul 4 18:01:24 2015 UTC,"So many cries about how useless spears are in native, but I still got wrecked in native MP by people who swings spears like a dagger and kill me when I am  on horse any time possible no matter if I am standing right at them ar at distance"
mountandblade,3c4chq,fanzypantz,18,Sat Jul 4 18:24:44 2015 UTC,"that's because they're good enough to time it correctly to deal extra damage. if they weren't that good, they wouldn't carry a spear."
mountandblade,3c4chq,martong93,5,Sat Jul 4 18:25:51 2015 UTC,the thing about spears.. Its one of the best weapons (irl) to put in a newbies hand if he was going to war.. But also becomes more deadly the better you become at it.
mountandblade,3c4chq,fanzypantz,15,Sat Jul 4 23:33:15 2015 UTC,In that way the game fails to emulate reality. Hence why it should be redone.
mountandblade,3c4chq,Urban_Viking,2,Sat Jul 4 23:42:56 2015 UTC,In this game everyone needs shields due to how easy it is to get good archer units.. And that does make using spears only without shields harder.   Archery is very hard to master and takes years to get up to the level of the units in the game.. Which makes them super OP because they are super cheap to get to nord sharpshooter or swadian sharpshooters in the game. And a skilled archer could fire 12 arrows per minute.. A while lot less than any archer units in the game..   I mean medieval warfare where heavily infantry focused and cavalry usually where used late in battles. Skilled archers where not easy to come by..  If archers and crossbowmen(not that hard to come by as skilled archers because its a whole lot easier to aim) where nerfed a lot. Just maybe in the XP required to train them is 3-4 times higher than everything else. I would think going in with units consisting of spear-men only with no shields will be way more viable an option because in native without shield  they work way better.
mountandblade,3c4chq,TrotsTwats,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:56:22 2015 UTC,"This link should hopefully display that, in the right hands, the spear is devastatingly deadly, even against those who have nearly mastered the combat system."
mountandblade,3c4chq,aleeque,2,Sun Jul 5 03:52:46 2015 UTC,Long spears are good for cavalry. Since lances are way too slow. But anyway Viking Conquest Reforged edition added an upwards stab for spears while with and without a shield. The upwards stab has less range than the down stab so if you get a shorter spear and shield as an infantry its a viable combat style. It does need some work but i reckon they need that in bannerlord as well.
mountandblade,3c4chq,Jaskorus,2,Sat Jul 4 22:17:36 2015 UTC,"In regards to your first point, the spear should rear a horse if a stab is delivered directly to its front, which in some way tries to emulate this mechanic. It is really the only way which an army is going to be able to defeat a bunch of knights without being annihilated by couched lances. Whilst this may be used in some effect by the AI (particularly Rhodoks), I do agree that the AIs use of the spear as an effective counter could be useful, and in general its ability to decide which weapon is going to be the most effective in a given situation.   Concerning your second point, whilst the spear may not be the best at any particular point, it is strong in all areas and very versatile. Their piercing damage may not be the highest, but it is not altogether bad if you are moving well. By removing a shield and equipping the spear two-handed, the ability to deliver blunt damage is added, which is the most effective against the heavily armoured opponents which you will inevitably face. The polearm is also very effective at stunning an enemy; an overhead hit on a shield can make it impossible for the shield-bearer to block a subsequent melee attack, as is seen in this video (this only works under certain conditions, see here). And the spear is quite fast; landing a side swing from a position where the enemy is on the side you are swinging on will often leave them open to another swing in the same direction."
mountandblade,3c4chq,TrotsTwats,2,Sun Jul 5 04:12:09 2015 UTC,"What a lot of people are neglecting to say is when a horse has the choice between impaling themselves on a spear or avoiding it, the rider can expect to be thrown from the saddle a lot of the time."
mountandblade,3c4chq,MarcusValeriusAquila,2,Sun Jul 5 11:18:55 2015 UTC,"tbh I can't agree, whenever my knights are facing infrantry with spears, they get destroyed much faster than if they're fighting sword infantry."
mountandblade,3c4chq,Duhya,4,Sun Jul 5 11:43:14 2015 UTC,"planting spears into the ground is bullshit, sure you will injure the horse but there will still be more than half a ton of dead horse slamming into you.  The only reason spears were used were because:  a) they were cheap to mass produce  b) simple to use, no need to train peasants too much  c) you have an advantage against horsemen, not the horse itself, basically you could clap the guy before he got close enough to shank you with a sword.  So, to make spears useful you could do two things to the game:  a) greatly expand the usage of spears, a sword should be a secondary weapon incase the spear busts apart.  b) change the AI so they use the spear from maximum range and not run head first into a berserker."

mountandblade,3c4chq,TrotsTwats,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:12:44 2015 UTC,"A and B are true, but the real value of spears is actually against the horse and not the rider.  The key here is that it needs to be plural.  One guy with a spear is likely getting killed by a mounted warrior charging him.  50 men with spears getting charged by 50 horsemen are in much better shape because horses are smart enough to realize ""I DON'T WANT TO RUN INTO THAT!"" and baulk.  Once a cavalryman is stationary he is more vulnerable than an infantryman."
mountandblade,3c4chq,KenpatchiRama-Sama,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:01:01 2015 UTC,"the closest analogue is if you time your thrust perfectly, it will deliver extra damage to the horse, but not nearly enough to be an effective counter,   Maybe for AI, but a player with a spear is impervious to cavalry unless you drown him in them, or distract them, and hit them unsuspecting(while hoping they aren't pretending to not see you.)  If they are stupid enough to come close to you, you can dodge away from their reach, into their horse, or stop their horse dead in it's tracks and slaughter the rider.  If they have a lance you can block down, and you are good. If they don't have a lance, they can't touch you. Another trick is to pretend you don't see the horse coming, and turn around at the last moment to turn the surprise around."

mountandblade,3c4chq,Duhya,7,Sat Jul 4 18:56:17 2015 UTC,"They should have it so when you press x you choke up on the spear, cutting its reach in half. This would make it more effective in close combat so you don't constantly bounce off the enemy."

mountandblade,3c4chq,TheArchmagister,3,Sat Jul 4 21:42:52 2015 UTC,"It's not really an issue with spears in particular, but with how the game handles thrusting weapons. I have the same issues with Rondel Daggers for instance.    Someone holding down-block is 100% immune to thrusts, regardless of the aim, strength, timing, or number of attacks.  The way the game translates weapon speed into damage particularly hurts thrusting weapons that hit their target at anywhere below 100% max weapon reach.    e.g. I'm standing still and my target is 1 foot in front of me. I take a swing at him, and my blow is interrupted because I didn't have enough clearance. This makes sense for slashing weapons where you build momentum through the swing, but it makes very little sense for thrusting weapons (assuming you have enough clearance to swing it at all). A thrusting dagger should never ""whiff"" due to hitting the target before max weapon range. A spear that doesn't get fully extended should still stagger the target. You aren't going to make contact and then suddenly stop pushing with your thrusting weapon.   There are some spear-specific problems but I see most of them have been posted already."
mountandblade,3c4chq,average_fan_guy,2,Sun Jul 5 00:57:24 2015 UTC,"Your second point is frequently relieved in multiplayer, and could be done just as easily in single player, by maneuvering the spear's animation so that it takes longer to hit and therefore strikes an opponent, no matter how close, with a large amount of damage."
mountandblade,3c4chq,TrotsTwats,2,Sun Jul 5 08:03:51 2015 UTC,"Spears are both over-powered and under-powered for the wrong reasons. The historical effectiveness of spears is null due to a down-block stopping a thrust but the close combat, I historical effectiveness is high due to the weightlessness and the ability to spin-stab. If spears are going to be balanced an engine change is nessasary to make combat weightier and give turning a speed limit based on equipment weight."

mountandblade,3c5p4w,GenericEvilDude,2,Sun Jul 5 02:08:36 2015 UTC,"Copying something I wrote earlier on another topic.    as your forces grow, a diversified and steady revenue stream will become more important and enterprises play an important role in that. You should look at it as an investment that will become more valuable with time.  The price can be steep at first, but look at it this way: when you have invested 10,000 denars in an enterprise and it yields 500 denars profit on a weekly basis, it will take 20 weeks or 140 game days to earn back its cost. After that it's basically free money every week. Bear in mind though that the enterprise will not be operated the first week after you buy it and you will also not get revenue when you are at war with the faction that owns the city it is in. Shifting economic circumstances also affect potential profits.  That said, having enterprises spread out across all factions still gives you a welcome source of revenue later on. It will dry your wallet all the time when you are just starting the game, but the sooner you build them the sooner they can start being profitable."

mountandblade,3c54zv,Yorkshirebread,5,Sat Jul 4 21:54:17 2015 UTC,"The fastest swing you can do with a one-handed weapon is a right slash. Two-handed weapons have the advantage of their weight, meaning an overhead swing can be very lethal. If you're locked behind your shield, keep in mind that you can use E to kick. This will disrupt your attacker just long enough for you to take the advantage, but if you miss, you'll be dead.  When the animation players for a character falling off a horse, it's hard to tell where their hitbox will be. I personally find that in these situations, a slash is your best bet to contact them (as it has the widest area of effect). Know that they'll immediately start rising back up, so anticipate where they'll be when your blade makes contact.  When you run for long enough, you will enter sprint mode. This will slightly increase your movement speed, meaning you can get places faster and outrun danger. Changing weapons, adjusting, jumping, and similar actions will all stop your sprinting. If you have to go far and don't want to hold down the sprint button, tap the chat button and you'll continue moving forward. When you want to stop sprinting, press esc and your movement will stop.  There are useful multiplayer guides in the sidebar, I recommend reading those now that you've had some time with the game. As always, if you have any questions feel free to ask."
mountandblade,3c54zv,TrotsTwats,2,Sat Jul 4 22:06:06 2015 UTC,"This information pretty much covers it but I would add that the swing you should make depends on your position in regards to the enemy, and if they are directly in front of you the fastest hit should be a quick left slash moving the mouse in towards the enemy.  Also, if you miss a dismounted player with a slash, you should be able to kick them once they begin to stand back up, interrupting the animation and allowing you to get a hit on them. A slash-kick-slash on a dismounted cavalry player is almost certain to kill them.  In regards to movement speed it should also be noted that all weight counts towards it, including weapon weight, and that you can still adjust your direction with the mouse without losing sprint speed."

I killed some bandits and gave all their prisoners to a lord and it gave me 60 relations with him in one go ( one of the best methods for gaining relations it seems)  a lot of this depends on the mod of course, POP for example gives you tons of relations for assigning people to be marshal, but not for giving troops to vassals, just be careful about what you do and you'll be fine."

As you may know, most kingdoms will war with you because of your size and lack of military.  Fiefless vassals always want a fief and will always support themselves. I try to give all of my vassals at least one fief before I gather and choose who to give fiefs to.  On the matter of relations, I typically choose 2-3 lords that are a good choice for becoming a vassal down the road. It's much like choosing companions in that you want lords who are compatible and optimal for you and the kingdom. You will need to establish a great relation with these lords because you need it to be able to take hits when you assign fiefs. Plus, being well-liked amongst lords is never a bad thing."

With the band he had brought together, Leif managed to take the castle from Stannis' armies, but when this True King himself arrived, his armies left few standing. Stannis allowed  the commander to live but exiled him to Essos. This proved to be a mistake as the anger still grew in the boys heart and he began raising a host of sellswords. With the Westerlands and the Stormlands pushing hard against his borders, Stannis was not prepared for the arrival of Leif's company and fell to the blade defending Dragonstone.  Realizing he now controlled a sizeable portion of land, this peasant turned noble proclaimed himself The People's King and began a conquest against those that turned their back to the common people. His proclamation would soon be put to the test as the Free Folk, the Targaryens, and the Iron Islands invaded.  Though at times he has faltered, Leif has proven a strong king, forging peace with many noble houses while destroying the invading wildings and pushing back the Iron Islanders. The Sisters and the Vale rose up against him during this time to dispute his rights to wear a crown, but he was able to subjugate one and find peace with the other.  Now Leif is seeing lords flock to him as he pushes on against the Iron Islands. He is on the doorstep to Lordsport and Pyke.

mountandblade,3c2h03,FayeGrimm,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:37:28 2015 UTC,"Jormund was a son of a lowly hunter in the Stormlands woods who got kicked out of his home village at an early age due to a wild temper and having drowned another boy in a fit of rage. After hard years of shaping into a proper thug of a man in the streets of the Weeping Town Jormund set out to find adventure.  After a time of dabbling in slavery of the local bandit population Jormund enlisted with a certain Kevan Lannister for the campaign against the Riverlands. Through loyal and violent service he earned the nickname 'Bloody' and was duly knighted soon before joining the final push against Saltpans and more or less ending the southern ambissions of the Young Wolf. In Kevans attack on the Northerners jumbled retreat Ser Jormund the Bloody even managed to best and subsequently imprison, on the behalf of his lord, the pretender Rob Stark himself. Having earned a reputation as a fierce fighter, a loyal steed and a decent plate of armor as well as some buisness ventures through the Westerlands Jormund departed from Westeros on a whim.  His adventures took him to Essos where he made a name for himself as a generally violent motherfucker and slaver extraordinaire until he was granted the fief of Janash by the prince of Lys. Endless wars against Tyrosh followed making Jormund rich but also making him realize the utter meaninglessness of the desert conflicts. When the Lysene grand army had finally brought Tyrosh to its heels, taking all their castles and imprisoning all but two or three of their lords something happened. After a week or more of sieging the great city of Tyrosh itself with an overwhelming army, on the brink of total victory, the prince called a feast. And went home to Lys taking all his lords with him. Bloody Jormund of Janash retracted his vow to the prince of Lys instantly and set sail for Westeros, disillusioned but with a terrifying army of Sellswords, Myrish crossbowmen and Dothraki Screamers.  Jormund Oathbreaker was not a popular name among the kings of Westeros, less so after he inadvertently helped release the Free Folk on the North. Nonetheless he swore allegiance to the Seastone Chair with the hope of one day marrying Asha Greyjoy and having his heirs one day become kings and queens of their own.  The campaign is going reasonably well. Ironborn controll all of the southern part of the North through Jormunds fierce marshalship. Rob Stark has been pushed back to Bear Island and the Deepwood while the Free Folk have grabbed all of the castles on the east coast and Winterfell (after Jormund sacked it a time or two only to loose it again when defending White Harbor). Asha loves Jormund but the old cunt Balon still hates his guts even after excellent marshalship and having been saved countless times. After bringing down the Starks almost single-handedly I've still only gotten my hands of the poor-ass fief of Coldwolf."

mountandblade,3bxwig,hatperigee,7,Fri Jul 3 02:33:56 2015 UTC,"Edit: Not relevant now!  IamA was originally community-driven. Reddit hiring Victoria was a clear sign that IAMA was important to the website, and that they wanted to work with the mods to improve it. Running with this new partnership IAMA grew to an extent that wouldn't have been possible otherwise. The mods were probably very excited to accept her help.  If the mods had been aware that the admins would pull things like this, they would have kept it entirely community-driven. Relying on Victoria was at the time the right decision, even though it created a mutual dependency. The admins have since acted unpredictably, and unilaterally changed the dynamic. That's hardly the mods' fault."

As time has gone on, a lot of people feel like she's the only admin who cared about the community around Reddit and not just the money.

mountandblade,3bxwig,AerMarcus,10,Fri Jul 3 02:00:08 2015 UTC,"Victoria (organizes AMA's for all the big subreddits, official Reddit employee) was fired without any notification to the mods of those big Subreddits. The Subreddits fell apart because they had no way to contact or verify the AMA's with the people, so /r/IAMA went private to sort it out. Other big Subreddits couldn't do their thing because they had no way to do their AMAs, so they went private too.  A lot of people dislike some of the decisions and false promises of the admins and this was a breaking point, so they went private too. Now hundreds of Subreddits are going private in protest.    It should be noted that Victoria was still willing to help out the Subreddits even though she wasn't being paid for it anymore, and apologized for letting them down (because she's awesome). Reddit admins say they now have an official team in control of AMAs and that they'll help organise them.  Some people believe this happened because Victoria wouldn't relocate, or because she was against monetizing AMAs and Reddit wanted them to be. Whatever the reason, we're left with a blank front page and Reddit is bleeding money from the loss of traffic to these Subreddits.   Hopefully there will be some changes, but it's hard to tell right now.    I recommend reading through the comments of that post I linked. Here is live updates about the incident."

mountandblade,3c106q,xaliber_skyrim,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:06:54 2015 UTC,I just remember doing it half a year ago when I needed to edit/replace some scenes.
mountandblade,3c106q,aleeque,3,Sun Jul 5 05:27:22 2015 UTC,"As long as you're replacing the same type of scene (in this case a village) then you could simply replace rename the 1257AD file with the name that village's scene file uses.  Villages, and centers in general, are listed numerically in the code and by their files.  You can figure out which number the village you want is by visiting the parties.txt file and doing a search for the village's name.  If the name has any spaces in it then you'll need to replace them with a ""_"".  Once you've done that you'll get a line of text that reads something like:  1 131 131 p_village_41 Dugan 2114575 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 175.000000 -39.500000 175.000000 -39.500000 175.000000 -39.500000 0.0 0   The village in question above is ""Dugan"" and is listed as ""p_village_41"".  This simply means that; ""p"" = ""party"" (center or traveling party), ""village"" is its type and 41 is the number it is associated with.  Now that we know we're dealing with village #41 we can head over to the ""SceneObj"" folder within the mod in question and look for a file named ""scn_village_41.sco"".  That's the scene file you want.  Now replace the native scene with this one once you've renamed it to match the # of the village you want to replace.  If you're using the Native module then be sure to make a copy of it as you should avoid editing the native module itself whenever possible.  Just make a ""myNative"" folder or something."

Ctrl + clicking on an item in the loot screen quick loots it to your inventory instead of drag and dropping everything.  Horses in your inventory will increase your movement speed on the world map by carrying the weight of your inventory items for you. This has a diminishing effect and can be fairly complicated, but recommended number is 9-12 horses in most cases.  Lame horses can be healed to normal type horses if anyone in your party has wound treatment and they are left in your inventory. It might not be fast depending on your skill, but it'll happen eventually, which can be a great way to get great horses for cheap early on since lame ones sell for like 10% of the cost."

There was a post a few months ago where someone went into great detail about the pack horse mechanic, and it's really really complicated at its core, but in practicality is really as simple as 9-12 in most situations is best. IIRC his testing found out that pack horses can actually slow you down if your inventory is empty, but as you start adding weight you start getting relatively faster and become more efficient after only like 2 food items I think."

And now there's this horse thing. What else did I miss?  I don't mind having to wade through muddy water to get to the good stuff of the game. A big part of the fun is poking at the game and seeing what comes back.

mountandblade,3c06eo,Enterino,7,Fri Jul 3 16:00:31 2015 UTC,I mean if it works for you then do it! I always thought unsullied were too lightly armored
mountandblade,3c06eo,Swayingorb786,3,Fri Jul 3 18:04:48 2015 UTC,"Unsullied are in my opinion in the top 3 for troops. Their only downside is being a little bit squishy and a little spendy. Other two options are heavy knights (I usually only have 20-30 of them at any given time) but they are pretty pricey too, and veteran halberdiers who are tough as nails and cheap.  Unsullied are the best offensively, but they lack the heavy armor of the other troops so if they are in a meat grinder or if they are being stupid in combat that can be their downfall. Certainly still incredible top tier soldiers, but not the clear cut best troop."
mountandblade,3c06eo,FayeGrimm,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:59:45 2015 UTC,I personally like Ironborn and sistermen heavy retainers as unsullied tend to die quickly on me.  If you can afford them and it works for you I see no reason to stop anything.
mountandblade,3bzq7d,Jean_Valswan,5,Fri Jul 3 13:41:07 2015 UTC,"If you want to try and hold it, drop your troops into the garrison for the time being and ride around and recruit whatever troops you can in a day or two. In taverns there are mercenaries that demand a fee before they join you and usually have higher wages than comparable faction troops, but with mercs you get somewhat professional troops straight away. Large numbers of peasants also have a deterring effect on would-be attackers that come with a small group.  Be advised though! When Graveth chooses which vassal gets to keep the castle, the troops garrisoned there will also become the property of that same vassal, which may not be you. This decision usually comes after 2 - 3 days.   Try to keep tabs on what your fellow Rhodok lords are up to (ask them 'what is the realm doing?' and 'what are you and your men doing?'. If they are campaigning in the surrounding area, then help isn't very far away.   But if a full-blown enemy campaign force is coming your way to take the castle, chances that you can hold it at this point are very small. What you can do in that case is just evacuate your troops as much as possible, let the enemy take it, lie low for a day or so and then return when their attention is elsewhere.  A castle that has been recently conquered usually has a small number of troops ( ~ 40 - 120) instead of a full garrison.  However if the maximum number of troops you can command is 70 which I assumed from your post, then you probably don't have the staying power yet to really hold off the big boys in the game.   Good luck though!"
mountandblade,3bzq7d,Orcrist9000,2,Fri Jul 3 14:18:13 2015 UTC,Wow thanks alot for the advice.  Your right I can only command 76 right now and there is a siege of about 800 Sarrinids at the gates so I think I'm just gonna leave. I can take this time to get my village prosperity up cause it keeps getting raided.  Thanks again!
mountandblade,3bzq7d,Paeyvn,5,Fri Jul 3 14:27:34 2015 UTC,"Sometimes Mount and Blade just doesn't want you to have nice things. (That's my town and the smallest of 4 or 5 campaign forces in a row that has hit it)  Honestly though, where there's a will there's a way. I eventually managed to overcome that and hold it. The advantage you get when defending is pretty massive, and you can also try to get creative. Try to snipe their marshall somehow if you can...lure bandits or friendly lords over near their force and it's likely everyone will try to mob them. If they do, the marshall normally stays behind building siege equipment and has no backup and can be sniped, which disbands their campaign.  Depending on how strong your garrison is along with your 70 man party you may be able to hold that. If there isn't much of a garrison though, it might be wise to leave and let them take it, then snatch it back after they leave again. Try and get as many troops in there as you can and then worry about training them later if you need to. AI uses pure numbers in the garrison to determine targets it wants to attack and if you have 500 recruits, they think it's a hard target...although some campaigns will still go after it anyway and then you need some valuable troops to top off the defense force. Trainer skill is invaluable for training up a good defense force. My general practice for defending territories I want to hold is to throw everything except cavalry that I have left in my party after conquering into the garrison, then ride around and recruit a whole ton of new guys, ride back to the castle and throw them in (promoting whoever gets trained up in tiers along the way), then do it one more time to refill my army and this time I keep the new recruits myself to turn back into my actual army."
mountandblade,3bzq7d,Abnorc,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:33:32 2015 UTC,Where does the marshal stand during a siege? (I have never been on the defending side.)

mountandblade,3bzq7d,Orcrist9000,2,Mon Jul 6 12:39:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, time to bail ass in that case. The above advice might still work later on. Another thing: don't be too hopeful that you can nurture your village back to economic health. It seems the foe's AI in that regard is stacked against the player and they well travel to the ends of the earth just to raid your one village and not touch anything else in the meantime.   What's most important is gaining levels, renown, relations with other lords (all this you mostly earn on the battlefield with them), and lots of money with which you set up enterprises in towns.   I'm not saying you shouldn't care about your village, I always do, but there's only so much you can do for it the way the game is set up."
mountandblade,3bzq7d,iKhan98,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:43:11 2015 UTC,So would you say that enterprises would be my best bet for money right now?
mountandblade,3bzq7d,Abnorc,2,Fri Jul 3 15:01:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, Dont go for the dye and weavery, it may look good to have that much money coming in from one source. But starting out, ironworks and Breweries are very cheap and produces a lot of money once you get a few going. The 2 cities that you should build are definitely dye works in Rivacheg(Northernmost Vaegir City) and Ironworks in Curaw."
mountandblade,3bzq7d,iKhan98,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:09:58 2015 UTC,I've had an ironworks that consumed 234 denars/week. The dyeworks have always been positive for me.
mountandblade,3bzq7d,Abnorc,2,Mon Jul 6 04:34:37 2015 UTC,"Dyeworks are good investments, but you gotta check what the places are gonna give you before building. Early on, breweries are cheap and cost effective and can be build anywhere without any problems(Dhirim and Suno(or was it Uxkhal) actually do make more) and ironworks works alot in Curaw(Lots of denar). When you shift toward dyeworks, ALWAYS build urs at Rivacheg because it just Casterly Rock. They got cheap dyes and silks and it gives a lot more money. E.G it gave me 1500 denars(Yes, I am not kidding. It is possible) for several weeks before the city got attacked.  Also, take care not to build too much dyeworks as it over-saturates the market and drives the price down."
mountandblade,3bzq7d,iKhan98,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:11:00 2015 UTC,At how many dyeworks do you stop building new ones?
mountandblade,3bzq7d,Orcrist9000,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:38:15 2015 UTC,When the profits starts to dip. At 500(That's the average) is good. I typically start to stop building dyeworks when the market is overrun with stuff and profits are about 100-200(I can get more out off breweries and ironworks) but that is my personal preferences. The first dyework should be at Rivacheg(Cause it can make 1500 denars)
mountandblade,3bzq7d,aleeque,2,Wed Jul 8 14:48:22 2015 UTC,"Well, there are more direct sources of income, such as loot found after a battle, selling prisoners to ransom brokers and looting villages (I never do the latter, cause I always roleplay super honorable knights and honor is politically important later on). Placing bets on yourself and winning a tournament can also give you heaps on denars.  But as your forces grow, a diversified and steady revenue stream will become more important and enterprises play an important role in that. You should look at it as an investment that will become more valuable with time.   The price can be steep at first, but look at it this way: when you have invested 10,000 denars in an enterprise and it yields 500 denars profit on a weekly basis, it will take 20 weeks or 140 game days to earn back its cost. After that it's basically free money every week. Bear in mind though that the enterprise will not be operated the first week after you buy it and you will also not get revenue when you are at war with the faction that owns the city it is in. Shifting economic circumstances also affect potential profits.   That said, having enterprises spread out across all factions still gives you a welcome source of revenue later on. It will dry your wallet all the time when you are just starting the game, but the sooner you build them the sooner they can start being profitable.   So balance your current budget between hiring/upgrading troops and getting items for you and your companions (short term necessities) and investing in enterprises (long term)."
mountandblade,3bzq7d,iKhan98,3,Fri Jul 3 15:23:34 2015 UTC,"tip that may not help right now but will prove helpful in the future: the troops at the top of the list (be it your entourage or castle garrison) will enter the battle first.   So if you have like 20 elite troops, keep them at the top of the list."

It can increase it to numbers far in excess of what your computer can handle without problems btw, so I don't recommend pushing it straight to the 1000 limit. I honestly wouldn't go past 500 and like to keep it at 300 personally.  Floris also has a battle size number you can enter in the mod options, but this doesn't actually change the battle size technically but rather adjusts some Floris variables to work with the stated battle size as a guideline. Make sure you set this number to what you have your battle size set to or weird things can happen (like waves of 4 guys on each side, awkward reinforcements, etc)."

Everything is perfect but the voice acting, yet I can live with it. However, I looked at the new armors for both Legionnaires and Shadow Legion, and I was wondering if there will be some sort of release for textures and meshes like that because despite this mods already present greatness, I would literally jizz my pants if I could somehow have the armors in game (Me being a Shadow Knight squire and holding many empire troops).

mountandblade,3bvwdn,walfulninja,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:59:01 2015 UTC,How did you do that if you don't mind me asking?
mountandblade,3bvwdn,aleeque,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:16:56 2015 UTC,"basically you use Edit mode and press ctrl-e when inspecting a character's stat window. In edit mode, you can change their appearance and pressing ctrl-e gives you the unique code after you're done editing their face.  you can then paste this code into the module system file for troops. I don't remember the exact details but to do that, you have to install Python (2.7.1 version afair) and I forgot what next :( It was a while ago. Oh, and this process takes a LONG ass time. There's hundreds of unique npc's in the game. It went like this: edit npc -> alttab into module system txt file and paste the code -> back to the game -> edit next npc -> repeat.  I wasn't completely 100% satisfied with the result, fyi. There are two types of npc's: unique and semi-randomly generated (peasants etc). The latter kind are made by randomly choosing between two appearance states. So you basically have to make one state like this: ""young white male, short hair, thin nose, sort of weak chin etc"" and the other state like this: ""older black male, long hair, thick nose, stronger than average chin etc"". And the system will randomly select all of the attributes from between these two states so you end up with medium hair length Asians, middle aged bald whites etc.  Naturally, this sometimes produces kinda disappointing results. Still, I find it an improvement over the original because the uglier npc's are always the less important ones - village elders etc and even they most of the times look aesthetic. The unique ones (companions/lords/ladies etc) are all handmade."
mountandblade,3bvwdn,Sylentwolf8,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:04:54 2015 UTC,Why not release it as a submod?
mountandblade,3bvwdn,aleeque,6,Fri Jul 3 02:39:34 2015 UTC,"well, I used some of the various face/hair meshes from all kinds of mods. Literally took some from ACOK, some from Gekokujo, some from others. It was months ago and I no longer remember which resources are actually responsible for this. I have the entire M&B folder backuped, so that if/when I want to play the game again, I can just install it this way.  oh, and the above only applies to male faces. For females, I used the default vanilla resources. Reason being: I didn't like any of the female faces in any of the mods. They look too doll-ish to me. Vanilla females might not be super detailed, but they look natural at least.  if you're interested, you can check it out (warning: 500mb download): https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5iWoeRgDkvOeXZJYk1sRk54TUk/view?usp=sharing  It's just vanilla Warband with Diplomacy 3.3 and some other changes: new arenas (NOT the tournament system change but simply the cooler-looking, more varied scenes made by Adorno), three Native castles replaced by mott&bailey ones (made by some talented scener), training grounds replaced by improved ones (basically the same, just some added details - also made by Adorno I think). Plus new banners. And new death/wounded sound effects by Rejenorst (guy who worked with Taleworlds but they didn't release all of his work for some weird reason - the voice actors in these bonus sounds are the same people that voiced the original game). And new music by Rejenorst (it's insanely awesome). Plus some TweakMB tweaks (such as more sea raiders, faster siege tower building etc - those are changeable though). Plus all new characters start with a handgun. Why? Because I like to roleplay as a traveler from a far away land. Go figure. (doesn't break balance - the gun is pretty useless and weaker than a good bow, but I like to carry it around because it's so cool). Oh, and some new textures (Polished Buildings by Gutek iirc). And the small change so that you can access your inventory/party screen when you're about to start a siege (right after having built tower/ladders) which you couldn't do in vanilla. Plus you can change your banner in the camp screen.  So yeah, as you see, it's just an overhaul of Vanilla that I made by shamelessly taking various things made by other people. It's VERY stable though. As stable as the native game itself, I dare say. I actually went through every single scene and took my time to fix every odd object that I could find (such as two overlapping carpet textures on a roof that no one would see in-game etc). And I spent hours upon hours slightly editing helmet sizes so that they wouldn't overlap with head models (this problem stemmed from the fact that new head models aren't identical to old ones). I'm a perfectionist, lol. This was the reason I only included one gameplay-changing mod - Diplomacy which is very stable and has no bugs. I thought about including some other mods like Formations&AI but those are pretty bugged so I had to abandon that idea. I also fixed the Khergit siege bug where their archers would rush for the stairs when defending a castle instead of shooting at the attackers.  There's a chance you'll like it but again, it's tailored to my own tastes.  p.s. I use the 1.158 version of Warband with this mod."

mountandblade,3byjus,Gloamite,3,Fri Jul 3 05:21:13 2015 UTC,"I've been playing fairly religiously since the Steam sale, but I have not touched reforged as of yet.  There have been a few glitches here and there. Nothing major. Specifically, shield bash doesn't work in bandit ambushes in cities, nor when going after outlaw bounties in villages. A few issues when given rally points over specific rivers. Namely the one by Hadrian's Wall. I only noticed that when I could be brave enough to give longer rally points. Sometimes troops get stuck behind tree's or rocks when advancing in formation, but a quick ""Follow me"" order tends to clear that up.  As for the economy I'm not sure what you mean by balanced. You can make enough money to sustain a large force, but it will take time. Lords and cities have to like you and your standing with pagans and christians makes a difference. I have productive enterprises in every city in England except one, in every city on the continent, and two in Ireland. Only one of them isn't a brewery. I'm not sure why, but in every city barring Tunsberg the productive enterprises involving tools, wool, and linen don't make money. I do know they changed the mechanic in how the outlying villages affect the economy, but I don't know any of the details.  However, those haven't done more than help sustain me, all the growth was allowed by trade. The way trade works has been overhauled. Going to each village, and buying whats cheap then selling it in the cities can be amazingly lucrative. It's nice imho to see how critical villages have become to the overall economy.  Spears and polearms can be used effectively by the AI, but you must use the AI correctly. Spearmen and Infantry need to be in formations. Unless you have overwhelming force rushing in is a mistake. Spearmen are great counters to cavalry (spears aren't as lethal to horses as say in Floris, but a shieldwall of spearmen stops cavalry cold), which I only saw consistently when I began fighting lords. Prior to that they were okay. Don't use them for sieges they're wasted.  I couldn't name one thing that I'd call remarkable, but all the little things add up into a satisfying experience so far. Unit upgrades are more meaningful. Weapons break and degrade (but can be repaired). Availability of resources varies with the time of year. A lot of thought went into each change, and it definitely feels vary polished.  Only issue is you'll have a lot of questions, but there are very few resources.  P.S.: When you start fighting lords you'll get these things called battle and epic trophies. You turn those in to cities (not merchants, but an option shows up on the merchant screen of cities) and you get experience and currency."

mountandblade,3bwegc,Will12239,2,Thu Jul 2 19:41:34 2015 UTC,"Yea the sound won't change anything with your save. It's my favorite mod, but it's pretty tough in the beginning. The pretty low influence and rank point companions are worth picking up early so you get the party skill bonuses. Doing quests to get the rank and influence to get those guys also levels your other companions up quickly which is useful before the war starts at level 8. Here's the full companion location list. http://pastebin.com/1zHqTHjY"

EDIT: Nevermind, for some reason editing it in module.ini doesn't seem to be changing it. Oh well, I'll just import/export and reduce XP as needed to give myself a bit more exploration time. The world is too cool to not want to explore it peacefully for a bit before getting down to the business of war.;)"

mountandblade,3bwegc,-Arkennon,3,Thu Jul 2 21:08:21 2015 UTC,"Yah, walking around Moria, Mirkwood, Lothlorien, etc is wonderful. When I entered the great hall in Moria I was deathly scared for a moment that one of the fires might be the balrog--the hall looked so much like the scene from the movies. At the same time, I like that they took their lore from the books rather than movies.  One question--other than finding the book in the Moria, killing some goblins, and escaping (and enjoying the awesome scenes), nothing else there for now right? And I'm currently stuck on the escaping part, I found the bridge, crossed it, but can't seem to locate the escape door. Any chance you remember?"
mountandblade,3bwegc,Will12239,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:22:24 2015 UTC,"I didn't find anything. There are a bunch of bridges, but only one leads to the door. When the book asks you to find your way out, there's a long spiral staircase and the correct way is to go all the way to the bottom of it and go through the left passage which leads to the way out"
mountandblade,3bwegc,Jarbungo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:03:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I'll look again at the bottom. The bridge I was referring to is at the 2nd to bottom level of the staircase, and then through some caves. Thanks for all the tips! I really appreciate all the help and advice."

Unless the dev comments were out of date, they hadn't actually implemented an exit when they put Moria in. Visible work on the mod dropped off pretty quickly after they got 3.1 out, so I guess it just never got done."
mountandblade,3bwegc,Jarbungo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:01:19 2015 UTC,"I thought from some forum comments that they did have an exit (it originally didn't work, was reported as a bug, then was said to be fixed).

My veteran elven archers can't hit anything close up because of this, only mass bands of orcs when they still hit something. I'm thinking about switching entirely to other units because of this, but maybe it isn't so bad against uruk hai (since they are taller?) or maybe there is some way to fix it?"
mountandblade,3bwegc,Relexrahl,3,Mon Jul 6 23:12:39 2015 UTC,"Alright here's my 2 biggest issues with the mod, both mainly just things I need to learn.  1: When I do the quest to get the golden spears from Erebor, I get allowed in, walk through some tunnels, reach a door that I can only sometimes see the interact option, and even when I can it does nothing and I cant proceed.  2: How in the christ do you get started as a bad guy? I want to play as a band of warg riding orcs looting and killing but my god their stats suck."

I got stuck on this too and had to look it up.  It turns out the quest is not complete.  Honestly, I had a hard time getting started as a good guy too.

Just ran a letter to the dwarf king, and the underground halls were really impressive.  My one complaint would be the occasional odd weapon values. The strong bow is cheaper than the elven varieties, more powerful, and can be used on horse. Not sure why.  edit: Oh, looks like the bow difference is based on the elves having piercing damage. Makes sense now...."

mountandblade,3by4xo,Throwaway131447,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:08:29 2015 UTC,I've been looking at the Forum page for AWOIAF since I saw this post but as soon as I read this I decided it wasn't worth trying:   Kingdom Lord :  Balon Greyjoy. Pyke  Lords:  Yara Greyjoy. No fief  Goron Goodbrother. Hammerhorn  Meldred Merlyn. No fief  Waldon Wynch. Iron Holt  Rodrik Harlaw. Ten Towers   That just takes me right out of the mod. On a side note though there don't seem to be nearly enough lords per faction.
mountandblade,3byf9p,shamusisaninja,8,Fri Jul 3 04:37:12 2015 UTC,"Read this guide.  I would also recommend downloading the mini mod Diplomacy (available on the Steam Workshop). It adds features to Native while still being save compatible, so you can use it with your existing characters.   Play the Native game until you get a feel for the controls and mechanics, or just until you feel ready. From there, slowly move up from small mods to full conversion mods, being sure to enjoy every step as much as possible. That way, you do not get overwhelmed by all the features added by mods like Floris or Prophesy of Pendor.  If you have any questions as you play, ask them here on the Subreddit. The community is awesome and always quick to help.  For a small list of popular modules and a description of each, check here."
mountandblade,3byf9p,TrotsTwats,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:47:24 2015 UTC,"I second all of Trots' recommendations. I highly recommend trying different mods after you get the hang of native as it makes the game feel brand new in some cases. If you are a fan of lord of the rings or game of thrones there are fantastic mods for both of those as well as a bunch of others.  Beyond that, I highly recommend role-playing your game. Pick a personality and figure out a play style your character would use, even if it isn't always optimal. Huscarls and Swadian knights are terrific, but sometimes it is fun to lead a band of horse archers instead for a change."
mountandblade,3byf9p,FayeGrimm,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:15:41 2015 UTC,"10 hours in this game you'll barely get anywhere! My personal recommendation is to play as someone who purely tries to get rich, it's fun to have mass amounts of manhunters, selling thousands of denars worth of prisoners on every trip to a tavern. I think my last character had his cha at 21ish. Worth it.   Crap, forgot to actually say the mod I would recommend once you're ready for one. Floris is the one I personally play with, but once you really know the game and are ready to learn something new, I recommend The Last Days."

mountandblade,3bwoq5,Seanbox59,2,Thu Jul 2 19:42:12 2015 UTC,"Make sure you are using troop commands in combat and use the terrain to your advantage. I've slaughtered forces nearly triple my size because they had to climb a hill through a rain of arrows to even get to my soldiers and then were stuck on the low ground without a charge bonus.  Make sure to pick up some companions and get some points in trainer. Starting with tier 2 and 3 troops rather than tier 1 will make a big difference. Also make sure to train a companion into path finding asap and keep them at the bottom of your roster so you can always run when you need to.  When you are building your force make sure to pick your fights and stay near castles and cities so you can always stay the night to avoid getting chased down by the big bandit groups.  Make sure to just keep recruiting as much as possible early on. Getting a group of 40+ will keep almost all the bandits on the run even if you are mostly levies so that way you can pick your battles easier. Once you get more established I recommend doing some trading for cash (lannisport gold and myrrish carpets are fantastic money makers) before picking a group to go merc for. An easy option if you are in Westeros mostly is Lys our Tyrosh. They always war, but you'll never be bothered by it if you're on a different continent, plus you get paid.  Also, sellsword halberdiers are really great units once you start getting established. They usually make up the bulk of my infantry line in armies.  If there is anything specific you're wondering about just let me know!"
mountandblade,3bwq1w,SillyBronson,6,Thu Jul 2 19:52:10 2015 UTC,"Well truth be told there is a reason you don't see many merc companies with standing armies of decent troops.   I would recommend putting those denars to good use and buying some businesses, win some tournaments to speed up the process. If you are using a mod, find out how that mod allows you to make more money (Floris land investments, for example), that will help. Especially since you aren't permanently tied to any faction you wont have any of your businesses (if you spread it out over multiple factions) under constant sequestration.   If you want to go a step further, start your own faction or join another faction and start taking fiefs of your own. Taxes and Tariffs, baby (and a place to cheaply store reserves and defensive units)"
mountandblade,3bwq1w,Mephistopholees,2,Thu Jul 2 19:59:45 2015 UTC,"I've been playing Viking Conquest recently, so I think things are a little different for that version of the game, but if I recall correctly, if you just continue to fuck shit up for long enough, you'll eventually get called on to declare your fealty of a certain king.   It helps if you make sure to improve your relationship with both the king and his kingdom, so follow some of that nation's armies around when the kingdom is at war, and move in to help them whenever you see them get in a battle. This will improve your relations with the individual lords you help, as well as with the country you are helping to defend (most of the time). It also has the added benefit that you may be able to pick up some sweet gear after the bigger battles.   Eventually, once your renown and your relations get to a certain level, they will offer you a merc contract first and then an offer to swear fealty.   I believe you can find good lances either in the Khergit territory or in the desert people, whatever they're called. If it makes you feel better, I'm approaching the mid-game territory on VC and haven't even found a horse yet. I'm ready to get my own cavalry charges going."

Hit the enemy, break them, and then tell them to follow you and regroup for another attack. If they start chasing guys off all over the map they'll get isolated and killed. Get a doctor in your party (I recommend Jeremus) and then put him at the bottom of your party list so he's not showing up in the battles. You'll save a good portion of your casualties to fight another day. Since you're mostly fielding Cavalry, you should be faster than all the other lords (except those Khergit bastards) so pick your battles early on. Harass enemy lords, try to get them alone, and try to fight them after large battles so their toughest troops are still recovering. Cavalry absolutely wreck basic troops. Swadian Knights. Once you get about 50 of those guys nothing in the vanilla game will touch you except incredibly overwhelming numbers."
mountandblade,3bwq1w,treygreen13,2,Thu Jul 2 20:03:52 2015 UTC,"but I always end up quitting when I get to that awkward point where bandits are too weak/fast, but I can't take on anything bigger.   Ugh, I hate that phase. One of the things I made a big point of doing when I made a mod was to stagger the bandit difficulty to eliminate that altogether (honestly I think a lot of mods try to do something about it). Now there's a progression that you can ride all the way up to the point you're ready to create your own faction if that's your preference.   I'd recommend trying some mods, or upping the difficulty (not going to recommend my mod though, as the archers are more accurate and charging at a line of them a lot more dangerous), someone can probably recommend one that's more your speed, as that's not a fighting style I've looked for personally."
mountandblade,3bwq1w,someproteinguy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:23:04 2015 UTC,"Earning money with tournament victories (and selling Sea Raiders!) will allow you to buy businesses in a few cities. Once you've done that you can sustain a significant cavalry force without losing too much money. Once you have a solid core group of soldiers and a few good companions to cover party skills for moving around, healing and whatever else you want, join a faction and participate in large battles with the other lords while following the Marshal. Their numbers will let your elite troops take on armies much larger than you can take alone, and it helps you earn reputation with nobles, which is nice no matter which end-game goal you choose.  If you're not averse to multiple faction armies, using Rhodoks or Nords as your infantry units will give the enemy force something to think about while you wheel your cavalry around the side. Rhodoks have awesome shields that let them take a beating, and the Nord Huscarls are absurdly heavy infantry that deal out a lot of pain.  A large group of Swadian Knights or Sarranid Mamlukes will simply smash through everything they encounter except for each other, and they double as passable heavy infantry on foot. With only these units you can easily get enough renown to join a faction and participate in battles for territory."
mountandblade,3bwq1w,NotAForestHunter,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:13:14 2015 UTC,"You can use the NPC editor to make bandit types stronger and TweakMB to make them more numerous. This will affect other lords as well, making politics a bit different."
mountandblade,3bwq1w,aleeque,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:00:35 2015 UTC,"Lay off excess troops and focus on a small number of decent cavalry and a good Pathfinder if you want to chase bandits for a while longer, or kick your game up a notch by expanding your warband and start attacking the weak lords when you find them.   Piggyback on the bigger parties of the faction you are a mercenary for. Tournaments and major battles are a good source of renown, which will increase your party size."

I've never installed Fire and Sword or the original game, I have too much fun with Warband for me to bother.  Viking Conquest is another official mod, basically. I've not played it extensively, but it seems alright.  TL;DR: The only one I'd say is ""worth"" it is Napoleonic Wars. Your mileage may vary."

mountandblade,3bsqwl,Orcrist9000,2,Thu Jul 2 11:55:59 2015 UTC,"Always expanded. I find it gives me more flexibility in tactics when building an army regardless of what faction. While in native you could have a similar flexibility but it would require you mix the different faction troops, expanded lets me do the same without having to mix as much. Also the overall appearance of my army has a nicer feel to it. The larger variety of troops, means more armor/weapon combinations so I can roleplay a wider range of armies.  Although I will mention that expanded has kind of spoiled me with its larger troop trees. Sometimes when I try a new mod I get a bit bummed out when there is only a handful of units for each faction."
mountandblade,3bsqwl,Shmoox000,2,Wed Jul 1 22:28:27 2015 UTC,"Could you elaborate on the flexibility any more? For example, how are the nord archers in expanded better than native? Is it purely the weapons they are given or are there some behind the scenes numbers I'm unaware of?   The larger trees are very cool, but they're also super intimidating. So I guess I was more just trying to see if there was any reason NOT to choose it over native."
mountandblade,3bsqwl,FxtrtUnfrmChrlyKilo,3,Wed Jul 1 22:38:55 2015 UTC,"I can't really say anything about the Nord in Floris but I can tell you a bit about the Rhodoks. As you can see in their expanded troop tree they have some more options than just the sergeant / sharpshooter specializations.   In the infantry department, you can mix two-handed weapons (upper line in the image), sword&shield (second line) and pikes (second to last) all from the various Rhodok branches. Add to that the formations available in Floris and you have a lot more tactical options than you have with the Native setup.  The Rhodoks can also recruit light mounted lancers and mounted crossbowmen. A handful of these guys can give the Rhodoks some really nice maneuverability that they lack in Native and they come in handy when you want to chase down those last pesky Khergit horsemen at the end of a battle.   I would really recommend the expanded troop trees, that's where mod really shines in my opinion. Added items are nice and all, but they don't enrich the game in the way the new troops do. It may seem intimidating but I found that I learned it quickly enough."

mountandblade,3bsqwl,DUDE_R_T_F_M,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:57:56 2015 UTC,"Sadly, even with expanded the Nord Archers aren't really anything special and the fact that its only a T4 makes it a bit worse (a bit easier to level up tho). Although, many of the Nord units have some kind of throwing weapon which is a plus. The different troops is what gives it the flexibility, having more options and being able to tailor your army how you want to play. There are only so many tactics you can do with 50 huscarl compared to a mix of Aetheling, Vaeringi, Erfarne Himthige and Ealdorman. There is also better balance, you can stack swad cav or nord inf as before but you'll find that it won't work quite the same as it does with native since other factions may have more comparative units with the expanded trees.  http://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?topic=232794.0'  Link has a nice break down of the best troops by type. The larger troop trees may be intimidating at first but doesn't take that long to get used to them. You can find an the in game troop trees in the reports menu, clicking on the unit will show you its stats/weapons/armor, helps when trying to figure out what the differences are between branches."

mountandblade,3brxnk,thedankbank1021,5,Wed Jul 1 21:47:19 2015 UTC,"This is a feature the original M&B didn't have, and IMO adding this didn't improve the game. I see a lot of the honorable and good-natured type Lords getting kicked out for treason and the sadists and bad tempered ones being given lots of fiefs. WTF! Another thing original M&B did better was the way fief distribution made more sense. Amount and type of holdings along with renown were the biggest factors in fief distribution. You could theoretically start your own kingdom and easily keep all your Lords happy if you distributed fiefs in this manner. In Warband they're all whiners and complainers no matter how well you treat them, with a few exceptions, ""devoted"" Lords seldom complain. It really adds nothing to the game except tedium, something not particularly welcome in mid to late game which can get grindy enough anyway,"

And it kind of gave me an idea for a way to implement combat without denying other co-op players the opportunity to have their own armies or even factions:  Simply, make it so that any co-op player (if there is more than 2) has the right to take control of the A.I. armies during a battle, in form of their lead character, or if that's taken, a soldier of the type they choose from the list of engaging forces. And, if a player whose forces are actually participating in the battle wants to, they can allow other players to take control of some of their units the way you described.

So no pausing of the campaign map, this will obviously mean that you would need a server to host these co-op plays or you somehow manage to optimize it to just run it as a normal co-op.   Because battles don't take all that long and I can't imagine that the other players will be able to just speed up the time, it has to be a system like in Total war where all the people have to press the time skip button, and when one guy is in battle it goes back to real time for everyone. Meaning everyone can run to the guy in battle's aid while the battle is still going on. But that also means the AI can come to reinforce. This would be awesome and pretty realistic, and less annoying for those not in battle. I would hate to look at every single battle for every person throughout a campaign, which does allow you to literally get a look at how the player is doing if you are the enemy of him. So the only way you as the enemy will be able to look at the battle is if you participate against him.    That would be hard to do, but It's not impossible, especially if there is a dedicated server you just run on on a separate PC if it really would struggle to run on the same PC as a client."
mountandblade,3bq2qr,fanzypantz,3,Wed Jul 1 14:56:53 2015 UTC,"Speeding up time in the map while a battle is going on isn't realistic though.  They travel across half of Caladria in the time it takes your men to walk over a few hills.  Also, what if you don't want to travel to the battle?  What if you want to pause for a second and look at your quests/reports?  You wouldn't want time to be sped up at this point.  I think it could happen pretty often that some players would want to speed up time, and some players prefer that it slowed down, and some who want it to stay the same, depending on what they are doing while another player is in a battle.  Your solution isn't terrible but it's still pretty clunky.  The M&B developers are probably looking for something more elegant."
mountandblade,3bq2qr,caedicus,2,Wed Jul 1 17:40:34 2015 UTC,"I should clarify what I meant by the speeding up. When a player battle starts the speed is going to go down to real time again and nobody can put it up to higher. When you play the campaign and do stuff, like visiting a castle and checking your notes or skills, time still passes. You can't simply pause the entire game for everyone just because you want to check your stats without things happening. You can ask people to pause it, if you haven't played total war multiplayer you click on the x3 speed button and then the rest of the people see that I have pressed the x3 speed button, but the speed of the game wont speed up unless everyone presses the x3 speed button.   Have I lost ya? well my point being, to make it fluid and have no stops while one guy takes his sweet time to upgrade and look at his troops and stats of companions, which is going to ruin the game for 3 other people waiting for you. Therefore I think it would be best for it to just keep on running at whatever speed you set it to, or at least set it to 1x speed whenever someone is looking at your stats and when you close it again it goes up to 3x times.   The most elegant solution is: let the time run no matter what but speed it down to normal speed whenever someone is doing something. In other words the speed up will only happen when everyone really needs to get places, or in simpler terms; you wont speed the game up very often because you don't have the same finesse as you do in SP where you can start and stop the speed up really easily, we cant think of this as a SP experience, you need to take into consideration everyone playing. As well as there being a pause button for everyone to press.   This speed up system works great in Total War and probably can work in this game as well."
mountandblade,3bq2qr,fanzypantz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:28:54 2015 UTC,"I understand what you meant the first time :)  The only point I'm trying to make is that in M&B I would expect it be pretty common that at least one player will not be happy about the current speed of the game (or at least be annoyed).  For example,  One player might want to speed the game up (so they click on the x3 button), while another wants to look at their inventory.   Regardless of how the game decides what speed to run, at least one of those players will not be cool with the time speed that is chosen.   I haven't played Total War series, but I imagine there is less inventory/character/quest management in that game."
mountandblade,3bq2qr,caedicus,3,Thu Jul 2 01:21:59 2015 UTC,make it real time with a pause screen?
mountandblade,3bq2qr,MrSackballs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:31:06 2015 UTC,"Yea that could work, but /u/saturdaymorningswarm 's idea would make the game feel more fluid imo. I think it would be a bit off-putting to try and commit to something (eg: a siege) and then get a pause screen and have to wait until its done. But it would probably be worth it for epic moments like sieging a castle with another person or bringing several player controlled armies into a battlefield :D"
mountandblade,3bq2qr,Fishes_101,4,Wed Jul 1 09:52:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed bro.  I was talking about it with some friends of mine a week ago.  If M&B had coop story and maybe a bit bigger budget the first time around, it would be one of the top games around. It's such a great game. Only drawback is that you cannot share the experience with your buds"
mountandblade,3bq2qr,nerdfighting,3,Wed Jul 1 07:43:14 2015 UTC,I'd imagine it being similar to TW campaigns: you decide before launching the campaign whether it's coop or versus mode. During world map I would imagine it being like Paradox: people get to pause for short times before other people can unpause. If everyone rests in a city/camp time would move faster (like minecraft sleep system) and when a battle occurs you get to be a spectator or be given command of certain troops the commander 'gifts' you (like in TW). Depending on your coop/versus setting you can be gifted allied units or gain control of NPC armies.
mountandblade,3bq2qr,RomanIdiot,2,Wed Jul 1 08:14:05 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty common wishlist item on this sub. There are obvious huge challenges to implementing this.

Otherwise, just having the other players as companions in your party would be enough for me, as long as they could level their selves up, and take command of men for their selves."

mountandblade,3bptrg,Brisn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:53:34 2015 UTC,"Try to make sure your melee big boys go in first. Keep the archers below the ladders / platform so that they can shoot at the defenders and get in a few kills. In your case, tell the huscarls to charge first, then the knights. When you have some room on the wall, step in and try to get behind the defenders to hit them in the back / start taking out archer positions. When you're through the breach the fight becomes easier.   Being able to shoot helps in sieges, that way you can snipe some priority targets and do something while your troops are trying to get a foothold. Use a crossbow if you don't want to invest in power draw (bow & arrow) at this point.   If that doesn't help, then the enemy is just too strong at this point, or too numerous. How many enemies were there on the opposing side? How many mid-tier / elite?"
mountandblade,3bptrg,randomblade,0,Wed Jul 1 19:53:06 2015 UTC,"There were 80 strong there, 20 something of them veteran horse archers, the rest cannon fodder. And one pleb.

mountandblade,3bo0b6,Brisn,8,Tue Jun 30 19:40:15 2015 UTC,Well first you need to go to your character screen and click on statistics. Then press the export button. From there you need to go into your files and find where the savegames are. For my computer (Windows) its in the Documents>Mount&Blade Warband>Characters. There should be a text document with your characters name. Go into it and changing the numbers are pretty self explanatory. Save it when you're done and go back into your save game. This time go to character and statistics and press import character. Then you should be done! Hope that helped!
mountandblade,3bo0b6,EFlagS,4,Tue Jun 30 19:54:55 2015 UTC,Thanks. I will try this out myself and roleplay as Guts or something.

mountandblade,3bpmrz,TrotsTwats,3,Wed Jul 1 04:36:21 2015 UTC,"The wording in your original post was quite confusing. You are looking for the word spawn, not teleport.  Unfortunately, that's a limitation of how these camp scenes work. I have found it best to deploy a few troops on each spawn point or rather hold a central area together to coax them out. You can bring a ranged weapon and engage them from a distance, but this obviously depends on your character build.  Be sure to put your best units at the top of your party to ensure they follow you into battle. If your companions are lacking in combat skills, it's wise not to have them in these engagements."

Persuasion might possibly mitigate the effect.  Sneaking into towns is hilarious in Floris, because there's this thing that (some of) your companions follow you around as bodyguards when in towns. So when you sneak in, you're the only one wearing the disguise.   Me to the town guard: ""Yeah, people have said I look a lot like that warrior-king that has wrecked your country over the past months. But I'm really just a pilgrim. You wouldn't rob an old man of his walking stick, would you? Those five guys behind me are pilgrims too. Yeah I know. Their religion demands that they wear that battle-gear at all times, see?

I sold the 20 slaves I had with me dropping my party from 70 to 50 and I got in on my first try. If you're gonna sneak in for a tourney and have a castle you can swing by, drop off your dudes.

Really enjoy knowing a little more about characters and the history, makes everything a bit more meaningful.  Yesterday I unleashed both the Targaryens and the free folk and plunged the kingdom into chaos. Capped it off by taking two castles from the Vale and then losing only about 80 men when holding off an army of over 600 at  Claw Isle. First time defending a castle and it felt like the swarm of Vale men would never end but I suppose that's what happens when you attack a faction that hasn't been weakened by war!"

The TLD mod uses the human skeleton scaled down (the orcs are really just short humans). But instead of doing that you can create a custom skeleton with proper hitboxes...so now the hitboxes work great but you'd need to re-do armor meshes and animations to work with your new custom skeleton."

Seems like you covered that angle, though.  -Diplomacy sliders (centralization, trade policy, etc.) are set to extreme values that cause regular relations drop  -Vassals being defeated in battle makes them upset at you  -Some mods, iirc, have penalties if you have too many fiefs and they don't have enough.  As for the town income: The town was unoccupied for a while and their taxes built up. When you took control you collected all the past-due taxes at once. Fluctuating up to 50k is weird, though."

It can't be losing battles because they all drop at the exact same time.  I guess it could be that I have 2 towns to myself and a handful of unassigned villages.

mountandblade,3bpee7,Iamjesus147,7,Wed Jul 1 02:12:58 2015 UTC,"People usually say that new players should play the native/vanilla first to familiarize yourself with the game itself (it's already a great game without mods), even more so to let the changes made by mods more noticeable. However as a relatively new player myself I found there are several mods that do not stray too far from the native/vanilla feel yet still add some useful features.  I'm going to copy a comment I made somet time ago if you're looking for mods that feel most similar to native/vanilla.    I have tried:   Native Mod Compilation (I use the earlier 1.0 version because the latest one has an odd dialogue bug),  SnD's Polished Native (which is NMC + Graphics Improvisation), Tocan's Calradia, Scaedumar.   Those mods are among the few that do not change the troop tree radically (as a new player I want to get used to it first) and do not change faction but still offer useful features integrated from other popular mods such as Diplomacy and Prebattle Order. I'm not too sure with Floris as it changes a lot of things (overhauled troops, more in-depth battle tactics mechanics, lots of items that do not fit the era, custom music) and might feel overwhelming for a newcomer. The ""Basic"" pack seems safe though, it only has new items, new texture, and new music.  Tocan's Calradia and Scaedumar feel very similar (both has those gameplay-enhancing features from Diplomacy and Prebattle Order and gameplay addition features such as naval battle, seafaring, stronger bandits/bandit heroes) but in the end I pick Scaedumar because it doesn't meddle at all with the faction. Tocan's Calradia changes the faction a bit (changes people's and kingdom's names, change Swadian King to a queen); if you can live with it I'd recommend Tocan's Calradia as feature-wise it's more interesting.  (TL;DR: pick Tocan's Calradia if you don't mind few changes on faction, Scaedumar if you do)    And to add to this I've just found recently these mods:   KAOS - Political Wars - you can start playing as a king/vassal/prince, revolts happen with or without you Litus - not much, but it seems to be an ""easier mode"" version of the vanilla (more money, improvements cost less, faster benefits on building villages, etc).    I haven't tried those two though, but if you like experimenting those seem like viable options."
mountandblade,3bpee7,xaliber_skyrim,2,Wed Jul 1 03:07:48 2015 UTC,"I'd like to second Tocan's Calradia. I know floris is the most popular modpack, but Tocans is my vanilla+ mod of choice because it keeps the same style as vanilla."

mountandblade,3blc06,Fishes_101,4,Tue Jun 30 05:49:02 2015 UTC,That is actually an interesting way of doing it. Never though of it that way before. It's super obvious.
mountandblade,3blc06,fanzypantz,6,Tue Jun 30 12:36:17 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's actually why the circlejerk exists about Harlaus having feasts all the time, because Swadia is in the middle(ish) of Calradia so they have constant wars.

mountandblade,3bimbd,Mcdystolo,12,Mon Jun 29 15:08:49 2015 UTC,"Save and raid so you can afford the best enterprise in every city (usually dyeworks). This will massively increase your income and allow for larger, more expensive armies.  Cram Narra full of recruits to cheaply keep enemies from attacking it.  Use Rhodok Sharpshooters to decimate castle garrisons yourself, preferably castles close to Narra so you can centralize before eventually rebelling in the distant future."
mountandblade,3bimbd,Lelorinel,6,Mon Jun 29 15:15:12 2015 UTC,"With Rhodok Sharpshooters, how easy is it to take the normal sized castle? I think you could probably slowly pick the garrisons off, it would just take a while."
mountandblade,3bimbd,Lelorinel,11,Mon Jun 29 15:26:50 2015 UTC,"Very easy if you don't just charge. Don't let your men climb the ladder, just line them up like a firing squad and let them shoot the defenders until they run out of bolts.  Once your guys are out of ammo, run to the edge of the map and retreat from the battle. Rinse and repeat until defenders are gone."
mountandblade,3bimbd,siyo4,33,Mon Jun 29 15:31:36 2015 UTC,I find your lack of honor... Disturbing.

mountandblade,3bimbd,yngir,2,Mon Jun 29 15:55:03 2015 UTC,Just a question: would this work with towns too?
mountandblade,3bimbd,blahjustchris,2,Mon Jun 29 16:17:29 2015 UTC,Yes but just on a much larger scale. Usually the garrison is relatively larger for a town than it is for a castle so it will take longer.
mountandblade,3bimbd,Prometheus720,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:21:03 2015 UTC,"Though I have to say, its much easier on the Nord towns of Tihr, Sargoth and Wercheg. Their palisade walls barely come up to a man's knees making them easy pickings for archers."

mountandblade,3bimbd,Windyplains,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:11:01 2015 UTC,Dude I can't believe I never thought of that second idea. Thank you so much
mountandblade,3bimbd,Prometheus720,2,Mon Jun 29 21:06:54 2015 UTC,"The only reason to be a vassal is to hold a castle which will let you hold troops and sustain your campaigns for longer. The money you get as a vassal is less than you'd get as a mercenary slaving company.  While you're a merc or a vassal, you should either be making money or earning some damn renown and leveling up. Since you're a vassal, don't focus on money because the cows have already left the barn. Go get into a bunch of fights you can barely win. Don't worry about losing troops because you aren't fighting to win a war, you're fighting to get stronger. All you want to do is increase your troop cap.  When it's like 120, you're ready for some real fighting. I'd recommend just trying to wear down enemy cities and larger castles. You're going to abandon the Rhodoks anyway. No need to help them win wars unless you're able to take out an entire faction."
mountandblade,3bimbd,Windyplains,4,Mon Jun 29 19:12:50 2015 UTC,"Being a mercenary is profitable in many mods, but natively it pays fairly poorly.  Especially compared to having land.  Slaving, of course, is always profitable if not entirely consistent from week to week."
mountandblade,3bimbd,siyo4,2,Mon Jun 29 23:01:30 2015 UTC,"I'm suggesting he be a mercenary while he goes slaving. As a merc, you have no real requirement to do anything for your employers, and you also don't have any land at stake when the nation breaks out in war. You're basically a subsidized adventurer."
mountandblade,3bimbd,jimmyw404,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:22:24 2015 UTC,That makes sense.
mountandblade,3bimbd,Orcrist9000,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:00:50 2015 UTC,"Take 10-15 Nord Huscarls and 20-30 Rhodokian Sharpshooters, and pad with whatever you personally like, and you'll have an army fit to march on any stronghold. It'll still take work, but it's a damned good start point."
mountandblade,3bimbd,wooiljung,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:48:09 2015 UTC,"My recommendation is to get the maximum number of companions you can (all of them if you have high leadership/persuatsion, some combination that don't hate each other if you don't) and train them up / equip them.  Fastest way to do that is to leave all your troops at a garrison and then just roam around hitting whatever you can with your companions.  With high doctor skills, a bunch of high level and geared companions can serve as the core of your force, take the beatings and they only get stronger."
mountandblade,3bimbd,Orcrist9000,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:22:44 2015 UTC,"About marriage: it's a good idea to do that strategically as well. A fine catch would be a lady who is part of a powerful land-owning family within a faction. You can take a look in the Characters tab under Notes, and see who are related.   When you get married you will get relationship boosts with her relatives. In the long run, that will add to your building of strong bonds with powerful lords in Calradia. That will come in handy when you start your own kingdom.   Bards/minstrels in taverns in the Rhodok area can tell you about where feasts are going on (you'll probably be invited as well since you're a vassal). They can also tell you a bit about the lady you are interested in: primarily her personality and any potential suitors.   It's etiquette in Calradia to only start wooing a lady once you have permission from her guardian (usually the father, if she doesn't have one then it's the brother). Some ladies actually like it if you start hitting on them without asking permission from the guardian, others don't, and in some cases the guardians might take badly to you doing so depending on various factors.   When you hit it off, drop by when she asks you to, read poems to her (learn them from the bards), and see where it goes. There are some more things I could tell you but there should be something left to discover by yourself :)"

mountandblade,3bg4u6,LordsBlade,7,Mon Jun 29 09:09:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe something sort of like Crusader Kings.  You play as the character you created, get married, have heirs etc.  Then there could be a permadeath mode, so there's a chance of you dying in battle and then you play as one of your children if you do die.  There could be a family tree with the past characters you played as, sort of like Rogue Legacy, with stats and titles for each.  Characters could also die of old age, and players could set how likely it is that you might die in battle instead of being knocked out.  This all sounds too good to be true to be honest, I don't think it'll come in Bannerlord, maybe through a mod if someone really tried hard enough but still I don't think it's likely.  Makes me really wish for some Mount and Blade/Total War/Crusader Kings hybrid, maybe even with some elements of Civ 5's world generation and city building - but now I'm just dreaming."

mountandblade,3bfe2x,jollyjimmyy,10,Mon Jun 29 04:43:33 2015 UTC,Spears are just bad. Spear and shield is not viable in any way because of how slow and little damage the poke has unless you have a lot of momentum. Just a spear is just as bad.

mountandblade,3bfe2x,unimaginative_ID,8,Mon Jun 29 08:38:54 2015 UTC,A Thirty Year's War mod would be great for Warband. With Fire & Sword was set in that era but in a different setting. WF&S also had a few problems of it's own.
mountandblade,3bfe2x,EaterofWasps,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:15:06 2015 UTC,"On a similar note I'd be keen to have an English Civil War mod, in the same vein as Napoleonic Wars. I don't think it'd require that much effort to make (at least compared to single-player mods): basically just maps, uniforms and a different reload animation for matchlock muskets. Sadly I have no programming or texture-making skill so it'll probably only ever exist in my imagination."
mountandblade,3bfe2x,Spitfires,7,Mon Jun 29 16:39:54 2015 UTC,"WW1  it would be like a more modern Napoleonic wars, better rifles instead of muskets but still fairly slow, full autos would be the best units, you could even have cavalry, as well as some big horse drawn cannons/mortars   forts similar to Napoleonic wars, and trench warfare instead of open battles"

It was pretty clunky and didn't really feel much like a WW1 game. I think time periods after the invention of bolt-action rifles work better as FPSs than in the M&B engine."
mountandblade,3bfe2x,danbeans,6,Mon Jun 29 19:36:00 2015 UTC,"I'd love a mod where you're playing in Mongolia/China around the beginning of Genghis khan's rise to power.

mountandblade,3bfe2x,Calypto52,7,Tue Jun 30 14:55:35 2015 UTC,"Crusader Kings II in Mount and Blade... or Mount and Blade in Crusader Kings. Basically, combine the two.  But for Crusader Kings in Mount and Blade, the elements I'd really like is the progression of families and dynasties. Having lords die and their children succeed them would extend the game I think, as well as keep it interesting. And take some of the elements like de jure land and having to have a justification/reason for war, assassination plots, religion, divorces, training children and courtiers. It would be the most amazing game ever!"

mountandblade,3bfe2x,tupendous,3,Sun Jun 28 19:49:41 2015 UTC,"Nope, ACOK was made by Cozur, who is less egoistical and more sadistic in his modding. I once had the amusing misfortune to reply to a Reddit comment, slagging him off, only to have it pointed out to me that I was replying to the guy himself...  The other dude is Gabrilduro, who obviously takes a lot of pride in his mods because his fucking name is plastered all over everything in the mod, in capitals to boot.  If you can stomach the personalities, though, both are excellent modders, at least in the technical aspects."

mountandblade,3bfe2x,xaliber_skyrim,4,Mon Jun 29 05:16:38 2015 UTC,"Cozur doesn't try to big up his reputation like Gabrilduro, he just likes to make things really really hard for us players with 'realism' options such as a high chance of tripping over whenever you backpedal and near-guaranteed breakage of lances/light spears on the first strike in combat."

There are 5 corporations that battle for control of its citizens, providing security, basic needs and other services.  You fight over factories, mines and supply buildings that provide food and water.  All the fighting takes place indoors with rifles where projectiles are shot out with extreme air pressure."
mountandblade,3bfe2x,CaptianZaco,7,Sun Jun 28 20:07:17 2015 UTC,"That sounds more like a stand-alone game. I'd really like that. Then again, inserted in the M&B game it could be pretty tits."
mountandblade,3bfe2x,TheHobbyist94,4,Sun Jun 28 20:11:16 2015 UTC,"I feel like that goes against the Mount and Blade fighting mentality.   Don't get me wrong, that sounds like a great FPS... but mount and blade is more for large scale combat. You'd think when we start fighting on Mars, we wouldn't be lining up people and fighting. It would probably be like war now-a-days; small, strategic, and with the least amount of humans on the battle field.   WWII was the real last large conflict with many people on the battlefield."
mountandblade,3bfe2x,Fernorama,4,Mon Jun 29 00:15:46 2015 UTC,"Ever read the Red, Green and Blue Mars trilogy? That'd make an epic game."

You could have heaps of minor factions like Zhentarim, Various Orc tribes, Thay Slavers, The Harpers....  Features could include Magic like in Phantasy, Lots of different races. Some sort of diplomacy with a ""good vs evil"" setup for a large scale multi faction war!  Yes this is my dream."

mountandblade,3bfe2x,Dr_Irrational_PhD,5,Sun Jun 28 23:33:30 2015 UTC,"Skyrim combat is pretty shite, not gonna lie. It's so dumbed-down. I wish that more skill was involved.  If you're gonna make the game revolve around stats instead of player coordination, why dumb down the leveling system from Oblivion? To reach a wider audience, obviously, but I think that old TES fans were left with the worst of both worlds.  That being said, Skyrim was a great game and did great things for modding. There were just some strange decisions made in the design."

Two to four people playing at the same time and free to make any decisions they like. They can work together, or one can stab the other in the back. You name it.  Then I want it incorporated into other mods. How cool would it be to have three friends playing Geko as the most badass trio in history? Oda Nobunaga, Tokugawa Ieyasu, and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

mountandblade,3bfe2x,Fumblerful,3,Sun Jun 28 22:17:47 2015 UTC,"Star Wars: The Clone Wars single player mod which would be far more narrative driven and lore-conscious than SW:Conquest. You can play as a Sith Lord or Jedi General who commands Droid/Clone armies to frontline battles. If you play as a clone you actually serve as a frontline soldier (ala Freelancer but more extreme) troops are not recruited but requisitioned in batches as they come produced from the droid foundries/cloning chambers of Geonosis/Kamino. You can also play as a Senator who travels to neutral worlds and coerces them to join the Republic or the Seperatists. Certain planets would have special attributes like ""shipyards"", ""armory"", etc and taking over these planets would slow down production of a certain commodity ( e.g taking over shipyards would slow down ship production by 50%).  In SW:Conquest an army can have a ship but here there are multiple ships that can be controlled within a fleet and there is a crude system for fleet vs fleet combat before any kind of boarding action takes place.   I really want to make this happen but its probably a bit too ambitious for me especially considering the warband engine :("

mountandblade,3bfe2x,jollyjimmyy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:58:59 2015 UTC,"Quick unrelated question: I can tell my village to light a large fire near town. Why? Is this to prevent enemy raids during wars? If so, what's the success rate?"
mountandblade,3bfe2x,TheHobbyist94,2,Wed Jul 1 01:35:06 2015 UTC,"If you have a nearby village light a fire while trying to accomplish the ""Rescue a Lord"" quest in the town then there are less guards.  The idea is that they've gone off to investigate the fire and/or help put it out.  I can't remember exactly, but I think it drops the total number of guards you have to deal with from 8 to 4 when you actually break the lord out of prison."

mountandblade,3bfe2x,Striding_Huntsman,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:44:07 2015 UTC,I don't want a multi player. Something like Viking conquest but you have to choose your faction at the beginning but can chose to leave after you gain so much command and notoriety. Start out as a young Junior officer.

And I kinda like it.  It's a seriously anarchist mod system, where anyone with any amount of experience can work on these mods.  Sure, you gotta download tons of them but then you find a diamond in the rough and it's just suddenly great.  I for one am a fan, considering that I've poured probably just the same amount of hours into ACOK and Anno Dominini than I have Native."

Still, I'm grateful for the recommend, I had no idea something like that existed. Can you believe I only tried L'Aigle last week?

Not many westerns made anymore, it's kind of sad. One genre I think would be cool is post-apocalyptic westerns. A wasteland setting but with western elements. Kind of like Fallout: New Vegas if it was a movie."
mountandblade,3bfe2x,Shomey,2,Sun Jun 28 22:56:29 2015 UTC,"The movie's like a month and a half old, maybe two. I like Modern Westerns because a lot of work goes into them, look at that Jesse James movie. Or maybe I'm being biased because I must've seen every Western from 1960 until 1975, I used to love them so much.  I've been thinking a lot about that aswell, every post-apocalyptic scenario is contemporary, never seen one done for the 1800s or hell, even Medieval times.

The backspace menu being referred to opens up a statistical display of the battlefield with army composition and numbers versus enemy numbers and a minimap showing positions of forces. One can issue commands through this minimap by selecting a division either through clicking the checkbox next to it or by using the number keys (1 for infantry, 2 for archers, 3 for cav, etc) and then clicking on the map. The unit will then execute a hold position command at that location and can be useful for moving units in real time to react to enemy movements or flank. Charge and a number of other commands are also easy to execute and see when they would be effective."

After tons of kiting, accidentally having reinforcements spawn on top of me, about 4 kite shields, and tons of wall hopping and stair climbing I successfully lived through everything.   Maidenpool was granted to me too! My first castle ever, and I got married to Rykker's daughter (Lord of Duskendale) a couple days later. Completely worth the effort.

mountandblade,3bf6hd,TheTrain19,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:25:34 2015 UTC,"Here's a tip mentioned in that imgur guide: Never pick the Khergite Khanates as your starting area. Spend several levels worth of time in the arena, like up to 7 or 8 to get your weapon skills higher as well as some money and experience. Also, Ymira is level 1, so you can easily turn her into any kind of companion with time. Avoid sticking around in the Nordic land too long, you want to avoid those Sea Raiders until you've got the companions you want, a nice mid-to-end game tier list of units before farming them. Those sea raiders are the highest leveled enemies in the game aside from lords and their war parties and those axes they lob at you can really hurt, even a strong shield can take a chunk of damage from those things.  You can also try to get good reputation with the various towns in each kingdom, that way you'll get more recruits who will sign up when you need them to replenish your army and chances are that yes, you'll lose your in some fights.  I'm not sure if it's in Warband or not, but in old M&B, there is this setting in one of the files that makes it so after so many days, losing can potentially result in the loss of a stat point permanently. I think there's a method to disable it since you're the only one affected by it and it is rather crippling if you've got a fully-fleshed out build and suddenly one of your stats drops and is no longer divisible by 3, making you also lose ranks in skills tied to that stat as well I think."

I think it had something to do with starting the battle in a holding position, being joined by an npc lord, and then forgetting to give commands till the enemy was routed. Only real issue I've noticed. In general though it does seem like troops try to orient themselves around the player character, and that can lead to some wonky situation.  Only other thing I've noticed is shield bash doesn't work in bandit ambushes in cities or going after outlaws in villages. Also made the mistake of accepting a ""Destroy the Bandit Lair"" without finding the camp, and after 50 in game days combing around Scuin I could not find it.

mountandblade,3bbyo4,Maklodes,30,Sat Jun 27 19:34:32 2015 UTC,"Interesting question.  I give it to the Napoleonic troops 7/10.   The first thing to address of course is muskets. Now the average casualty rate for a Napoleonic regiment on the receiving end of a volley at 60 yards is 5% (decreasing to about 2-3% at 100 yards). So the casualty rates from a volley at medium range will not be enough to swing it. However as the distance closes that will increase substantially.    However the morale breaking effect of this volley is not to be underestimated.  The Old Guard were broken at Waterloo by close range volleys. And these were Napoleons most veteran soldiers who were utterly dedicated. Against a group of men who have never experienced it's like before they will route and route HARD.   So assuming that Calradians don't break they will reach melee range. This is a slaughter of the Napoleonic troops. Rudimentary training and equipped with a short spear they stand no chance against levies equipped with a spear and shield. They will have shorter reach and no chance of getting around a shield.  Now we must also take into account the quality of the troops. Taking the default I'd say 33rd foot during the early peninsula campaign. Pitted against an equivalent Calradian formation. Now that would consist of a large number of levies arranged into loose companies. To take a battalion at full strength (although they rarely were) is roughly 1000 men. Taking the same amount of Calradians.   Now you mention cavalry. Assuming you add cavalry regiments to this engagement this is alao something that must be discussed. As well as artillery.   Cavalry vs Cavalry is not a contest.  With hussars being armed with sabers and heavier cav being armed with heavy sword and armoured with nothing. (Excluding the curiassers.) These are slashing weapons rendering them near useless against chainmail. Calradian cavalry will destroy its counterparts.  However, Napoleonic cavalry will be able to outrun them allowing them to choose when and where to engage.   Cavalry vs Infantry is interesting. It's debatable whether calradian cavalry would be able to break a square. I would say with no. Despite their superiority they still face the same challenges the cavalry of the era did. You can't make your horse charge into a wall of pikes. When you stop outside it there are 4+ infantry for every one cavalrymen. Hanging around too long lets the 3rd and 4th rank of the square shoot you at point-blank range. Resulting in a dead horse and/or a dead rider.  The Napoleonic cavalry would still be effective against calradian infantry providing they did not charge headlong into a block of stationary organised infantry.  The disruptive morale breaking effect of a cavalry charge is as dominant as ever.  Artillery. The Calradians have  no artillery of note. Catapults and Trebuchets are not viable battlefield artillery pieces. Cannons will punish a calradian army fiercely.  First with round then with canister shot. Inflicting huge casualties and crippling morale.   Then there are the archers. Bows are superior to muskets. They fire faster, more accurately and more reliably. They will be able to inflict considerable casualties on the unarmoured,  shieldless infantry. However, suffering enemy fire is part of being an infantryman of that period. And bows are less terrifying than artillery or musket fire.  Rifles must also be considered.  The farthest recorded hit from a baker rifle is 600 yards. Being able to kill enemy commanders from a 400 yard distance regardless of their armour will also contribute to the disorientation and morale damage suffered by calradian troops.  In summary: whilst the individual abilities of the Calradians puts them above the Napoleonic soldiers the cumulative morale damaging effects will cripple and route the Calradians. Leaving them vulnerable to cavalry and outright annihilation as a cohesive fighting force.  Edit: Spelling and Grammar  Edit2: Just realised that the 33rd would be veterans from india at that point. A better aproximation would be the 52nd at Waterloo. It was also the closest battallion to full strength.  Edit3: So OP is talking about ingame. Oops. The majority of the post is still valid I guess. If you ignore the morale effects and add the game mechanics to a square (Meaning Calradian Cavalry will break a square.) then the Calradians should take it easily. However if we were to pit organised light infantry against them then it becomes less clear. As a constant fighting withdrawal, where the slower Calradians cannot catch up, would cause them to suffer dearly. Despite this the light infantry are still very vulnerable to cav. Which means that the Napoleonic forces should still lose. Calradians 8/10."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,GodEmperorTitus,7,Sat Jun 27 22:20:37 2015 UTC,"Bows are superior to muskets.    in-game yeah but in reality, no.  You have to put into account that the Napoleonic era was the golden age of artillery, so the Calradian army would be decimates by flying battery. But, we are talking about the game, so."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,Cageweek,9,Sun Jun 28 14:43:05 2015 UTC,"Bows are superior to muskets in combat. Of course, if you count artillery as muskets then it's not even a contest.   Muskets only replaced bows because of a few reasons. Namely it's much easier and cheaper to train someone with a musket than a bow, which takes a long time to be proficient in.  Muskets also have an incredible misfire rate. Rising to up to 50% in poor conditions with extended use."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,GodEmperorTitus,0,Sun Jun 28 15:00:12 2015 UTC,"Which is why the musket was better. I agree, and I think you're correct when you say the bow wins but if someone deployed a unit of musketeers and fired in volleys ... Entirely strategically, the musket wins in the end. Easier to train and replace, manufacture, create ammo for, penetrating the richest forms of armour, a muske volley would destroy a unit of Swadian knights. If it doesn't kill you it usually wounds you beyond repair, while an arrow has a clean entry wound that can't kill instantly, unless it hits a heart or something."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,Cageweek,5,Sun Jun 28 15:08:49 2015 UTC,"Nope, such a volley would not destroy said knights. Assuming a distance of about 30 yards the entire front rank of the knights goes down. Horses and all. Casualties in the 2nd rank. The charge doesn't falter and the knights crash into the infantry. Assuming they are not in square this will break and route the infantry.   What must be considered is that the volley will hit and kill almost everyone in the front rank. But each man will be hit half a dozen times. Wasting the large effect of the volley. This is the reason that despite having a 15% hit rate at 100 yards casualties were normally around 3-4%.   I agree that in the overview. Muskets are superior from a campaign perspective of course. I would not argue otherwise. Muskets became the dominant form of warfare for a reason.  However it is improper to assume that an equivalent number of well trained long bowmen engaging a unit of regular line infantry would lose."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,GodEmperorTitus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:21:26 2015 UTC,"What would stop the cavalry charge wouldn't be how many men you kill, it would be how many riders are brought down (ie. how many man and horse pairs fall).  The key difference here that I think you aren't considering is a massed cavalry charge becomes a strung out cavalry charge extremely quickly when a dozen horses crash to the ground and become obstacles for the ones behind.  You could guarantee that if the entire front rank was dropped, that a sizeable portion of  the second rank would either trip, stumble, or have to slow and change direction.  The charge would lose much of its momentum after the first volley and would either trickle into the defenders or end up spread across a wider front.    The Romans used to use this tactic (although primarily against infantry charges since it's harder to hit horses with ancient projectiles than with bullets).  It was the main reason for throwing the pilum at the opposing charge.  The front rank of the enemy would either be struck with enough impact to be dropped or would block it with their shield and still need to stagger and drop their shield.  This was enough to practically bring an entire army's running charge to a walk for the last few yards before contact.  That really is the important thing here.  If you can stop the cavalry from moving they are more vulnerable than if they were infantry."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,MarcusValeriusAquila,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:51:29 2015 UTC,"I refer to my earlier point. If you can find a instance where a single massed volley from an unsupported infantry battalion stopped a cavalry charge to the extent that the unit was saved (I.e not charged by the cavalry to the extent that they were driven from the field.) then I would be inclined to agree with you.  I am struggling to find any particular instances of this occurring. The fact that it was not considered even remotely part of strategy of the era, and that an infantry unit caught out of square by cavalry being considered destroyed is very telling. Especially considering that it took some time for a battalion to form square the idea of giving an effective volley beforehand is completely disregarded. It also must be considered the state of the Infantry who, having just fired their muskets at close range will not be at all ready to receive a charge."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,GodEmperorTitus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:45:02 2015 UTC,I don't have a particular example.  I think it largely depends on how well trained the infantry are and also comparative size of the cavalry charge vs the infantry formation.    I think it is telling though that the use of heavy cavalry and then melee cavalry overall fell out of fashion after the adoption of massed musket (with bayonet) formations.  By the Napoleonic era much cavalry had already begun to shift to a dragoon type of role and the idea of heavy cavalry had already been abandoned for lighter and swifter cavalry that could better manoeuvre around infantry instead of relying on one devastating heavy charge.
mountandblade,3bbyo4,MarcusValeriusAquila,-1,Tue Jul 7 15:15:47 2015 UTC,"However it is improper to assume that an equivalent number of well trained long bowmen engaging a unit of regular line infantry would lose.   Well we're just going to have to agree to disagree on that one. Using muskets properly and killing the bowmen would put the archery part of that army out for a while.  And the knights would be killed because the muskets could fire in multiple volleys. Muskets are very inaccurate from a distance, which is why they were fired in volleys to compensate, creating a wall of lead. So I mean, multiple volleys would at least cut their numbers down enough for them to just give up, because then they will have pointy objects pricking at the few that are left."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,Cageweek,3,Sun Jun 28 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"Even with platoon fire I do not believe that the musket fire would be sufficient to break a unit of Knights. Simply because platoon fire did not break cavalry unit of the period in a charge. Only squares were capable of allowing infantry to combat cavalry.   Secondly a Napoleonic unit is outranged by archers. The effective range of a longbow was about 300 yards. Putting them well out of reach of musket fire. Especially as they are spread out and not in a compact Napoleonic formation. This means that the Napoleonic troops will have to advance. This would be done in column, as line formations are practically impossible to maneuver in anything but the most ideal conditions. So these Napoleonic troops are going to have to march in a nice compact square for 200 yards to reach a minimal effective distance to fire, then redeploy into line then fire. The archers can simply up sticks and walk away for another 200 yards, then repeat. In much the same way that the skirmishers of the Napoleonic era did. A great example would be the french skirmisher at Waterloo. Who sat atop the hill Wellesly's men were hiding behind, from french cannon fire, and caused a great toll on the British and Dutch troops. When the British advanced up the slope and drove away the skirmishers with volleys the French retreated down the hill only to return when the British sought cover again."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,GodEmperorTitus,0,Sun Jun 28 15:50:12 2015 UTC,"The effective range of a longbow was about 300 yards   There's a difference between effective range and maximum range. Henry the Eight set a minimum range for adults, as a bar, at 220 yards. According to Wikipedia, a professional archer is said to have shot 400 yards but I can't imagine that would be accurate if that's the highest possibly rumored. The largest mark in the 16th century was 345 apparently. My point is, how many of these arrows would actually hit? And if they hit, it wouldn't be a clean kill because of the design all arrows have, and the soldier could possibly fight on if he wasn't damaged too much to lie helpless, dying, or be pulled away to fight another day. I brought this up earlier but musket wounds were just about impossible to heal.   This would be done in column   Well, why? If they're fighting in a line, they're clear on all sides, they can just advance. Just run ahead, in a bit of a loose, skirmishing formation, and then line up as close as they need be. I know we're talking about games now, but armies in the Napoleonic era were larger than the ones in medieval times because of the feudal system and the nature of levies, while in the Napoleonic era we had stuff like mass drafts. If we assume that the armies would be larger, and units were big enough to deploy more than one line at the time, the volleys would be practically constant from all sides. The average soldier was expected to fire about four shots a minute, so that's one every fifteen seconds. I mean, you couldn't realistically field enough bowmen to make up for the mass production that was the musket, and how many could be levied into such an army."

Why are we still debating this point? I agree with you on that basis.   I agree that in the overview. Muskets are superior from a campaign perspective of course. I would not argue otherwise. Muskets became the dominant form of warfare for a reason.   The nominal reason for advancing in column is because otherwise your formation falls apart. This was a documented phenomena and the whole reason that the formation existed. With a small battalion you're looking at a line 150 men across. With a large one it would be 400 men across. The men on the edges cannot hear orders from the officers in the center. The men will cross different parts of ground. Slowing some men and speeding up others. Maneuvering to face an opponent is incredibly difficult because the formation now has to wheel around in a wide arc to face a new direction.  On the topic of shooting at archers. I quote Colonel George Hanger ""I do maintain and will prove... that no man has ever been killed at 200 yards by a common musket, by the person who aimed at him."" Reflections of the Menaced Invasion (London 1804) He then goes on to state his expectation that 1 hit for 200 shots is adequate. This is taking into account misfires and the like. However what must remain in mind is that this was against a solid formation of equivalent size. I.E a 200-400 man wide near solid wall of targets. Totally opposite of a group of archers with several solid paces of spreading in between them.  Edit: Also, one musket shot per 15 seconds is absurd. Achievable maybe by the very best of the best or very good men in ideal conditions. In a combat situation 2-3 rounds would be more accurate for an average quality unit."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,GodEmperorTitus,2,Sun Jun 28 16:23:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on that basis.   ups.  I think we've both said what needs to be said, I think we pretty much agree that the musket became the more tactically viable weapon outside of the game as time went on?

Napoleonic: Put riflemen in front of guards. Put horse guards behind infantry. Send dragoons to fire a few volleys into enemy cav then join horse guards.

mountandblade,3bbyo4,Tilting_Gambit,15,Mon Jun 29 03:02:55 2015 UTC,"no not really.  During medieval wars the majority of the troops were paesants who wished to be somewhere else, with absolutely no training about warfare and no will to fight. They are just fodder.  However, your average Napoleonic warrior has training, equipment and discipline. In battle, a single Napoleonic soldier could kill a Knight or a Lord in full plate with a single shot.  And that's just the average guy. There are thousands of them.  And even if it came to melee combat, the Napoleonic soldiers would still have an edge. Like i said, those are trained. They also learn how to fight in close combat because it is a necessity."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,Tilting_Gambit,20,Sat Jun 27 21:20:27 2015 UTC,"For the record, I absolutely agree that realistically an early 19th century army with artillery and guns would outmatch a Medieval-style army, but I don't think your characterization of Medieval armies is really universally, or even commonly, accurate.   During medieval wars the majority of the troops were paesants who wished to be somewhere else, with absolutely no training about warfare and no will to fight. They are just fodder.   Which battles do you have in mind? Most accounts I've read have included few untrained peasants. For expeditionary forces, the primitive logistics of the era put a hard limit on the sizes of armies that could be sustained in the field, meaning that quality was by necessity emphasized over quantity. (30,000 poorly-armed and trained troops might be worth 10,000 well-armed, well-trained troops, but 30,000 poorly-armed and trained troops eat about three times as much food as 10,000 well-armed, well-trained troops, and getting that much food transported across crude roads or requisitioned from local villages wasn't easy.)  Naturally, in some cases untrained peasants might attempt resist people attacking their village, or something, and of course more trained people of peasant background might be warriors (e.g., the Swiss pikers, the English archers, Dithmarschers, almoghavars, etc), but I don't know of many cases of a broad strategy of employing masses of untrained, unequipped peasant conscripts in the Medieval period.  Of course, sometimes feudal levies of knights and such yield well-trained but poorly motivated soldiers. The average knight or lord in Saint Louis's army invading Tunisia was probably well trained and equipped, but they had no desire to be in Tunisia.  Incidentally, conscripted peasantry was pretty much the core of the Grande Armée army of Napoleonic France, but they seem to have had fairly high morale (except maybe in really terrible circumstances like the Russia debacle).  At any rate, though, my main focus is on using game mechanics from NW vs. game mechanics from vanilla Warband. (Including the fact that bows are more accurate than even rifles in NW regardless of realism, and the fact that NW sappers can build things in the midst of battle whereas in Warband no one has any way of setting up fortifications period regardless of realism.)"
mountandblade,3bbyo4,Tabbouleh,2,Sat Jun 27 22:12:27 2015 UTC,"Now you're going into real life comparisons you're a little off base. Realistic arming / equipping of medieval soldiers was a nightmare. Depending on what era you're talking about exactly, it just gets more and more expensive. A well-off knight from say, the 1100s would need to invest considerable sums of money in merely equipping himself alone. He'd need chainmail which was a massive expense, a sword and a helmet. Not to mention horses for themselves and their squires. Knights and noblemen literally went bankrupt trying to fund expeditions to the Levant. Much of the Church's land holdings in the following centuries were gained because Crusaders had to sell off large swathes of land to fund their expedition.   Usually in European battles between 1100 and 1400 you had noblemen scrounging as many knights as they could, as they valued their men-at-arms and levies poorly. Equipping and training a large (enough) army on the income of the German, Italian or French nobility was virtually impossible. Which is why there was the rise of the mercenaries in the middle ages. You hire them for a campaign and then reap the rewards, while they collect their monthly wage, go on to the next war in the next part of the continent.   Exceptions to this are the English, who actually had a well centralised government after the War of the Roses. Which is why the English longbowmen were so lethal. They were forced to train every Sunday. This was unmatched in the Middle Ages by anybody but your Landschekt or Swiss mercenaries.   The difference between the armies of the middle ages and the Napoleonic era is the centralisation of government. Taxes flowing into Paris meant that France could raise an army of millions. Gunpowder was a great equaliser. A 16 year old peasant could fire a rifle just as well as a 30 year old campaign veteran. A few weeks of formation drilling and your troops are good to go. Which is why officers in the Napoleonic era were the most important factor of the battle. Until then whoever had the most knights was essentially going to win."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,XXAlpaca_Wool_SockXX,2,Sun Jun 28 03:17:49 2015 UTC,"So equipping and training a big army was hard in the middle ages. I didn't deny that. I claim that this (along with poor logistics) resulted in armies generally being small (compared to those of classical antiquity, and the early modern period), not in armies consisting primarily of masses of untrained, unequipped peasants.  I'd also urge you to look more deeply into some of your assertions, such as (for example) men-at-arms not being valued soldiers, and the effectiveness of English longbowmen being a result of centralization of English government following the War of the Roses."

My mistake. The 100 Years War. Regardless, they trained every Sunday and it was only the English who managed to get their peasants to do that."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,XXAlpaca_Wool_SockXX,3,Sun Jun 28 04:43:57 2015 UTC,"A few things:  I disagree with that description of medieval warfare on a couple of points: Assuming we're talking about Western Europe during the High and Late Middle Ages here, the picture was a bit more complicated. In England, at least (and I think in parts of France as well), a peasant owed his lord forty days of military service a year. After that, they had the choice of either going home or staying in service, but with pay. There was actually a bit of give-and-take in the relationship between a feudal nobleman and his peasants. Someone had to work the land, after all. You can't go on campaign for a season, get everyone killed, and then expect to keep your power very long. Also, not every levy went off to war armed with sticks and stones. If you're a peasant and you know that you're obliged to fight at your liege's bidding, why not arm yourself? On the flip side, if you're lord of a manor and you have to depend on your peasantry for the bulk of your troops, why not make sure they can fight?   Also, professional and semi-professional soldiers did exist, and even the most unblooded would have had training. We have manuscripts (and copies) from the medieval era and the renaissance like I.33 and Fior' di Battaglia. Their understanding of combat training was somewhat more nuanced than ""run straight at him and hit him with the pointy end till he falls over"".   Come to think of it, who is actually representing the ""medieval"" side of this, Calradia, or historical Europe? If it's Calradia, all that stuff about no training and no will to fight goes out the window; I can recruit Swadian Knights from a village if they like me enough."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,hatperigee,6,Sat Jun 27 22:56:26 2015 UTC,Calradia uses professional armies. You only fight peasants when raiding villages or intercepting parties of farmers. The average Calradian army would beat your average Napoleonic Wars army.
mountandblade,3bbyo4,BreaksFull,4,Sat Jun 27 22:03:18 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Have you ever played WF&S? If you try to apply Calradia-style tactics, you'll just get shot in the face from 100 meters away."

But if the artillery was in place they would be utterly decimated. Napoleonic soldiers are well-trained and extremely disciplined and can keep up a decent rate of fire that would disintegrate Calradian infantry formations. Once their formations are chewed up by cannon fire and musketry and they flee the cavalry will route them.
mountandblade,3bbyo4,ChurchillianGrooves,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:58:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think you characterize their training very well... part of the reason why guns are so successful is the lack of training you need to knock a knight on their ass.  Medieval weapons on the other hand are very different.  People get a silly impression that archers were cheap and weak peasants.  A longbow requires a lot of strength and skill to use effectively actually.  Not like a gun.  Mass 200 people with rifles, teach them for a couple of weeks how to maintain the thing and load them, and they can kill people.  Do the same thing with a longbow, and they probably won't even be strong enough to fire for 20 minutes without exhausting themselves.  Or learning how to control a horse with your thighs to fire the also very heavy draw weight composite bow.  Or developing the strength in your wrist to use a sword.  You simply can't give a peasant a bow or a sword, teach them for a few weeks, then expect them to be able to kill a real soldier.  Give them a rifle though..."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,Vivian1993,2,Sun Jun 28 12:32:28 2015 UTC,It depends heavily on the terrain and troop compositions. In an open field with high visibility the winner is the side with guns. In a very mountainous area the Caladrians might have a chance if they can get close before the firing starts.

mountandblade,3bbyo4,NativeNazi,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:42:51 2015 UTC,The game was designed with medieval weapons in mind and gunpowder weapons shoehorned in later.  I've never been a big fan of gun modules in M&B since they seem pretty ineffective (unless you get a rare hit on somebody) compared to other weapons.
mountandblade,3bbyo4,Vivian1993,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:04:09 2015 UTC,"Historically, I think you are right. I do not have sources with me because I'm at work, though.   During the hundred years war, France lost battles by huge margins, they would bring Knights with the finest plate Armor, and hundreds if not thousands of crossbows, and they got obliterated, even when they outnumbered the English 3 to 1 or better. This is because in England archery was encouraged from a very young age as a sport. By the time they were of fighting age, an Archer could fire several arrows a minute w/o aiming, with incredible accuracy. They could intuitively calculate where the arrow would fly. They would kill the Knights' horses, out from under them turning a trained Calvary charge into a meat grinder. And even though crossbows could be wielded with much less training and had more range and power they took so long to reload that the french could only fire a single volley before the English archers would close the distance and fire several volleys.   If you apply that to muskets, they took even longer to reload and had less accuracy than a late crossbow. So an Archer with a long bow had a good chance to wipe out line infantry. Actually I believe that it was Benjamin Franklin who said that the American Revolution would be more easily won with a few archers.  I am not sure how well this translates into game mechanics though. I will only say I believe you are correct when talking about the real world."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,NativeNazi,5,Sat Jun 27 23:48:57 2015 UTC,"The thing is: it took years, if not decades to master the long bow, but any random schmuck could fire a musket. And with ~300 random schmucks firing at the same time, you're bound to take out more than a few archers."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,Vivian1993,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:29:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are bound to hit some. But the archers can fire faster and more accurately, they can maintain combat effectiveness despite losses much more than a wall of muskets can. Eventually they could loose an engagement if they were vastly out numbered but I think they would stand a chance."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,NativeNazi,2,Sun Jun 28 01:37:31 2015 UTC,"Another thing to think about is I could take an arrow and still be combat effective. And a India pattern musket (used by the British army during the Napoleonic wars) fired a ball .75 of an inch wide, you're not shooting many arrows after that."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,Vivian1993,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:04:42 2015 UTC,"True, but only if it hits you.  Most of the battles that the English won in real life during the time period are credited to their archers. Even though they were peasants, usually, they had a certain respect from nobles, and Knights simply because they kept them alive during battles where there would be no hope otherwise. Likewise the french were known to hack off the fingers of captured archers, before brutally torturing them to death as a symbolic gesture due to the horrendous effectiveness on the battlefield.   Yes, an arrow may not kill you, but these archers were the best the world have ever seen, easily some of the most effective, highly trained breed of killers in the world at the time. Several bands wouldn't hire archers unless the archers could pass an insane qualification for accuracy in a certain time period.   A musket of that caliber will definately take you out of the fight. But that musket's firing speed is measured in minutes per shot. While the archers could hit targets lethally from a hundred yards or even more, and fire something to the tune of over a dozen arrows per minute. They lack the range and some of the stopping power of muskets, but the rate of fire and accuracy could possibly make up for that."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,Vivian1993,3,Sun Jun 28 02:43:36 2015 UTC,"I would just like to bring up my first point again, it would take a lot shorter to teach someone: bite bullet, pour a bit of black powder in pan, pour remainder down barrel, spit bullet, ram, put ramrod away, pull back flint, fire. And in the heat of battle a half decent soldier could fire 3 shots per minute."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,Yalazur,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:03:02 2015 UTC,"It takes less effort to train someone yes. However, firing 3 shots per minute, that's different than I have seen for soldiers who fought even a hundred years later. Take, for instance, rifles collected from the dead at battles like Antietam in the US Civil War, where a large number of rifles were not loaded properly, because in the heat of battle it was too much to keep track of, and soldiers panicked amongst the smoke, the confusion, and the overwhelming cacophony of noise in battle. It was common place, as I imagine it was during Napoleon's time, for soldiers to die after their rifles failed to fire due to operator error. As I would imagine (though I do not know enough about guns to say definitively) that gunpowder weapons during Napoleon's time were even more difficult to operate than during the Civil War. And even less accurate.   This could in part be counteracted by tactics such as deploying forces in rank and file so that the first line fires and then reloads while the second line fires and so on and so forth. But that also requires standing in formation, which makes you an easier target for a volley of arrows, that even if you are correct about the 3 shots per minute, is still at least 4 times slower than a trained Archer."
mountandblade,3bbyo4,mouser2940,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:13:21 2015 UTC,"Actually, if I was a soldier in the Napoleonic wars I could get away without using the ramrod and still fire almost as effectively. It was called tap or spit loading. You would empty the cartridge, spit the bullet down the barrel and then bang it on the ground. It was pretty common at the time"
mountandblade,3bbyo4,Fenrirr,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:34:08 2015 UTC,"That's cool. Never heard of it before. Had no idea. Still, as an Archer, you empty the quiver on the ground in front of you, and pick up an arrow, before the first arrow has landed in its target you've already fired a second arrow. That kind of speed and efficiency with a fire arm wouldn't really be seen until the repeater rifle (I think, again, I don't know a whole lot about the history of firearms)."

The musket, especially the early 19th century Modèle 1777 corrigé, were actually quite accurate and speedy to reload. People often forget that muskets at that point were used for 200 years. It is like comparing late medieval swords to early renaissance ones. There is such a difference in technological advancement that you cannot seriously round them up in the same group.  Even if you do consider the Napoleonic War's DLC, I played in a regiment for a few weeks, and I have to say the muskets were much more accurate than the bows or x-bows of vanilla (or modded, e.g. floris). A finer example of accuracy is the skirmisher types, like the British Rifleman."

mountandblade,3bcqz8,c4liban,5,Sat Jun 27 23:58:51 2015 UTC,"Faction relations are not so import, mainly keep them 0 or above so their lords wont charge at you and stomp you.  Relations with individual lords is different, you can talk to them and get jobs to improve relations. Higher relations will make recruiting them to your court easier should you decide to start your own kingdom.  Press the ""C"" key to access the character menu and from there you can find reports of all lords and towns/villages.  Also looting villages will make the village itself, and the lord who owns it quite angry."
mountandblade,3bcqz8,SalasSolus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:50:00 2015 UTC,"Simply put : Raiding a village angers the Kingdom the owns it, and the lord that owns it. So if its a Swadian village owned by Lord Buttercup (this name is for example purposes until a mod adds Lord Buttercup) then Swadia and Buttercup will be angered. No one else."
mountandblade,3bcqz8,Taz9494,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:10:23 2015 UTC,"Hostile actions (raiding villages/caravans, taking lords prisoner etc) reduce relation, likewise positive actions increase relation (aiding in combat freeing noble prisoners etc). If you swear fealty to a king or change factions, to my understanding, your factions relations reset to that of your new faction. You share friends and enemies. Joining a faction is the quickest route to peace."
mountandblade,3bcqz8,ethangf01,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:17:10 2015 UTC,"There a lot of good answers here but I wanted to add that it matters whether or not you have sworn an oath. If you are flying solo, then raiding anything is bad; because you have no reason to do it, raiding something puts you on the same level as a common bandit and raider, losing you honor and right to rule. The relationship (R) level you have will go from 0 to the negatives meaning you are enemy of the realm, like if you were at war. This is bad because now all the lords of said realm will actively hunt you down meaning it will be hard to anything there.   The R points you lose with the lord and protector of the village your are raiding are not that important I would say. They are harder to get back (as you would have to do a lot of quests for him or save him during a fight) but it doesn't really matter. You WILL have enemies eventually, nothing can be done about that, even if you release the lords you capture constantly some are jerks and will take it as an insult no matter what (reencounter here will cost you -15 points!). I wouldn't go overboard though. It's not good to make enemies with everyone. Friends are important.   When I go full bandit I usually only commit do my bad deeds on 1 or 2 realms and stay friendly with the rest.   What I said about R points not being when concerning factions is mostly because once you DO take an oath (not just as a vassal–mercenary contracts are the same here) your relations will ""reset"".  Example:   You raid a lot of Fierdsvan villages and they are upset, but if you take a mercenary contract under King Ulric of Sarleon while they are at war, your relationships with drop again because now are at war with them ""for reals"". Once the war is over though, your relationships with the Fierdsvan will go back to a nice neutral 0 no matter what horrible things you once did to their peasants.   Edit: I realized I just used Prophecy of Pendor factions right there but its the same in native if that's what you are playing. In native I think it's even easier because even though the lord giving you the contract says you must fight with them for a one month minimum it isn't true. You can go to your king and ask him to void the contract at which point your relationships will reset just the same. In PoP mod however you have to fight for a 30 day minimum. So you can't do cheesy stuff."
mountandblade,3bb21m,Deadeye2401,33,Sat Jun 27 14:39:54 2015 UTC,"The king is very indifferent to me and has been.   That's the crux of your problem right there. You could start by raising your relation with the King by doing quests and tasks for him.   I'm going to copy one of my comments from a similar recent thread, you might get some add'l info from the responses on that one too.   On being awarded fiefs: There's some complex math that goes into it (you can find the formula on the wiki) but it's based on your current number of fiefs, your overall renown, and just plain luck. Focus on increasing your relation with King Ragnar, the current Marshal, and the most influential Nordic lords. You also want to keep increasing your renown by various means - tourneys, battles, etc. The more battles you win against your enemies during wars - especially alongside your fellow lords - the better your reputation will be. If you can convince other lords to support your claim to a fief, their renown will count toward your claim, which is why you want to get in good with the political decision-makers within your kingdom.  Taking castles or cities on your own will increase the chance they'll be awarded to you, but it can still go to other lords. As you're still in the fairly early game, you're unlikely to be able to take any on your own for a while, though, so I wouldn't worry about that until you can field a decent army of 150-200 soldiers or more.  For sieges: the lord who 'controls' the siege is assigned to do so (behind the scenes) by the Marshal of the realm. TMK, it's not possible to be assigned to lead the siege by your Marshal; you'd have to be the Marshal yourself. To lead your own siege, you have to besiege a castle or city on your own, directly (not by joining a siege that's in-progress). You can sometimes do so with some help from other lords by requesting they follow you (or you can suggest they lay siege themselves, and if they trust you, they'll do so and then you can help them).      Basically, to increase your chances of getting better fiefs, you want to spend time doing quests for your liege and your Marshal, on winning victories in the field during wars, on winning tournaments, and on boosting your relations with the upper echelon of the aristocracy so you can enlist their support when an important castle or city is up for grabs. As you become more well-liked and tales of your valor spread throughout the kingdom, the king will look more kindly on your achievements, especially as he'll consider you a personal friend whose aid has proven invaluable to the realm. Good luck!"
mountandblade,3bb21m,Super_Jay,3,Sat Jun 27 14:44:49 2015 UTC,"I got in so good with King Graveth on my current playthrough that he always gives me land that I request. Which at first was pretty dope.  I was holding Culmarr Castle and captured Haringoth Castle and had hoped that the request would be turned down so that I could start my own kingdom and capture an extremely weakened Praven as a launch point for taking over the territory that belongs to the Swadians.  He gave me the castle. So then I think, NBD I'll just capture Praven and he surely won't grant me that because I already have two castles and a village. Nope, he grants me title. So I move on and capture Suno and what does that mofo Graveth do? He grants me the title! WTF NO I underestimated how much he hates everyone in the kingdom right now.... probably because the surge I pushed for against the Sarranid Sultanate was starting to fall back and we were loosing territory like mad. Perfect conditions to start a new kingdom with weak neighbors... but the King wants to keep me close because even with our paltry 14 relationship he's all about granting me cities... NO!  So now my troops are holding my cities, I am still affiliated with the rhodoks, the rhodoks have lost Maras Castle and Etrosq Castle to the Nords, the Swadians are down to only Uxkhal and a handful of castles and what is my character doing? Following Graveth around looking for every opportunity to cheese him off and lower our relationship so that he'll stop giving me land!  STOP GIVING ME LAND GRAVETH.

mountandblade,3bb21m,uncleshelby,3,Sat Jun 27 15:06:35 2015 UTC,A nice way to raise your relationship with the king if he won't give you quests is to talk to him every time a fief is up for grabs and tell him you support whoever he supports.

However, and this is just an opinion, massive trees can be boring because you hardly ever get the very best from them. Or just very few.  So i could advise to not go overboard.  For example, Floris expanded's troop tree is all kinds of weird. Some units can become archers, then footmen again, then archers again. Or vice versa. Annoying to memorize and doesn't really make sense.  As for equipment, try not to make it worse as you go up. Some units in mods have shields up until the last tier, where they havent any.   For infantry you could have an option to either upgrade towards an offensive path with twohanded weapons and no shields or towards a path focussed on defense. Cavalry is straight forward.  I like your Swadian path so far. If i were you i would ditch the Levy path and replace Militia with Recruit. Makes all the other troops -1 less tier so they are easier to obtain."

mountandblade,3bc82m,Darkarcher117,4,Sat Jun 27 23:56:25 2015 UTC,"It looks good, definitely something I'd be interested in using.  I liked the intention of the Floris expanded troop trees, but I thought there were just too many options for the sake of options, and you'd have to reference the list constantly to even know what half the units are.  I'm glad you've named yours names that a lowly peasant like me can understand!  My only concern/recommendation is to keep the ""staples"" present. In swadia, for example, I noticed that you replaced the bowmen with crossbowmen, which I don't think fits their theme as well.  Otherwise it looks like some very nice work!"
mountandblade,3bc82m,Cdmbr,3,Mon Jun 29 10:58:33 2015 UTC,"So bear with me, these are just random ideas that I had.  I'd call the last tier swordsman something like ""Professional Swordsman"" instead of ""Foot Knight"" and give him a one handed or 1h/2h sword for the continuity of the troop type.  I'd also make a higher spearman tier (perhaps in exchange of getting rid of the highest swordsman tier) and call those ""Dismounted Knights"", giving them a spear, a shield and a mace.  Looks real good though, I'd definitely be interested in trying it out."

Toss 20-30 huscarls at the top of the ladder and put some archers shooting down, and position yourself with a 2 handed weapon like a glave so you can hit then from behind as they climb the ladder.

mountandblade,3bb9tz,cianastro,2,Sun Jun 28 14:32:55 2015 UTC,"A castle that comes to mind, although it might not be the most secure castle ever, would be Yruma Castle. It can be found close to Khudan and Curaw.  Basically, you have to use a siege ladder to get up on the castle wall, though before you get there your forces need to run quite a bit, since you're spawned far away from the castle. If you prop a bunch of Vaegir Marksmen and Rhodok Sharpshooters on the walls you'll be bombarding the enemy with arrows and possibly kill a whole bunch before they even reach the siege ladder.  Once they've got the siege ladder moving, you just put a shield of Nord Huscarls where they'll enter. Grab a spear of some sort and simply try to hack away as your enemies are trying to cross, and fight your Huscarls.  TL;DR  Pros:   -Spawnpoint is far from the castle walls, so you can bombard the enemies with archers as they're moving towards you. -Flat snowy tundra, both a pro and con depending wether if you're attacking or defending. Excellent for Marksmen or Sharpshooters to pick off easy kills.  Cons:   -Siege ladder is being used, which means that the enemy will be able to send units over with ease. -Might be hard to claim in the first place due to the Vaegirs usually occupying the castle, and their Marksmen will continously fire upon you, and might kill a heap of infantry.  Correct me if I'm wrong, I might as well have spoken about the wrong castle, although I am 100% sure the castle is located in the Vaegir lands, close to Khudan.

We just go through the gate.  That being said, there is one castle design that forces the enemy to climb up a massive staircase, and you have two archer nests at the top, as well as a wall to hide behind. If you position gunners on the ground aiming at the gate, and spearmen hiding behind the wall, you'll annihilate the enemy waves, especially because they get so far separated from their reinforcements.

mountandblade,3baaik,MrWendal,6,Sat Jun 27 08:18:36 2015 UTC,"This is something I've been wondering, too! My 'main' Floris game is hung up in the mid-late stages (don't remember how many days now, 300+ I think?) where our glorious Nord kingdom has controls over half of the world map, and the rest is split between the Rhodoks (a few castles), the Sarranids (one city and a couple castles), and the Khergits (everything else). We're without a doubt the dominant political and military force in Calradia, but it's really slow going, now.   I was having a ton of fun earlier in the playthrough, but at this point it's just a lot of tedium - our Marshal is too scatterbrained to focus on taking add'l cities or castles, because every time any village anywhere gets attacked, he chucks military strategy into the trashcan and hauls off to ride across the entire continent to try and save one village that will be a smoking ruin by the time we get there. I'm bored with playing whack-a-mole with the enemy raiding armies (which are so small they can't do anything else), I can't rely on our marshal to coordinate military offensives, we're generally at war with at least two other kingdoms at once, and with lords defecting and defeated factions (Swadia and Vaegir) able to spontaneously reappear at any moment, it just doesn't feel like this game will ever end. It's disappointing, b/c I was really enjoying it for a long time, but now it's just ground to a halt.   I don't really feel like starting over from scratch after I've invested so much time in this one character's playthrough - I've started characters in ACOK, PoP, and Gekokujo but I lose interest pretty quickly since I already did the 'building a lone merc to a powerful nobleman' thing in my Floris game. So I end up spending more time talking about M&B here than I do actually playing the game anymore. :("
mountandblade,3baaik,Super_Jay,2,Sat Jun 27 15:09:05 2015 UTC,"What you're describing is what ends up killing the game for me as well.  I understand that you can kind of tell people where to roam and protect, but it's not enough and gets tedious, as you said.  If there were a way to see and select ""units"", or lords and their armies, in the overworld view and directly tell them where to go, like an RTS, it would be amazing."
mountandblade,3baaik,Zaemz,2,Tue Jun 30 22:03:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, totally. That's actually what I was hoping the Marshal post would confer - and it does! For a while.   I got to issue orders, coordinate strategy, prioritize targets, and generally run our kingdom's overarching military endeavors with a coherent plan that was sorely lacking prior to my involvement. So for a whole hour or two, we were really effective. And then I accumulated too much controversy because the lords who didn't do what I told them to would get defeated or villages would get attacked and literally every single loss or military setback is considered to be the fault of the player. So I willingly abdicated the position, but with my departure went any kind of cohesive strategery. Now we're back to the whack-a-mole nonsense where Marshals call off sieges to go protect villages on the other side of the world.   With a few tweaks, a lot of this would be more fun and more feasible. I'm frankly surprised that a game can be out for so long and this stuff hasn't been addressed somehow; it's (apparently) just taken as a given that finishing a Warband playthrough is very, very rare. I gotta say, that really sucks. Stuff like faction resurrection and lord defections should be toggle options, not embedded, irrevocable settings that prolong the game indefinitely. Overarching strategy shouldn't be nearly this hard to coordinate. I know I could break away, form my own kingdom, and eventually assume direct control, but I don't really want to deal with managing all the political influence and intrigue necessary to manage my own kingdom. I just want to be able to make steady military progress and help my existing kingdom take over Calradia. That really shouldn't be too much to ask."

You probably ended up helping one of the bandit groups in a fight against one of your enemies. This happened to me once and I've helped people with it before.  Here's a link to the last guy this happened to. Just replace ""woku pirates"" with whatever bandit group is still attacking you. Everything works the same way.  If you can't tell what the name of this group is in the code, just change the colors of different bandit groups until the ones who are bothering you have a different color.

From there I usually roam Westeros, do tournaments and spend the money I get from winning by setting up entreprises in as much towns as possible.  After I've accumulated a pretty large sum, I usually go to Essos to hire a bunch of sellswords ( they're the best units in the mod, which is kinda weird ) and become a vassal to a king, or, if I'm feeling really ballsy, I try to take Lorath, or one of the Three Daughters."

(Note that the newest update for it is just around the corner, and will be save game breaking.)  The amount of things it introduces/improves is amazing. It is a sort of successor to Floris, but with a ton of great new ideas.  It lets you learn the base prices of items, to always know how low or high everything is being sold, making a freelancer much easier, with a touch of trading.  It expands greatly on the Tournament system, giving more interesting, less one sided rewards dependant on your accomplishments. It even improves you standing with the local lord!  It lets you pick the mission you'll embark in employ of guild masters, instead of any chance of being handed one you loathe, or are not well equiped for.  It adds a new level of possibilities in character customization, by letting you choose certain (admittedly gamey) feats, that boost various aspects of your character's abilities, as well as add similar ones to your companions.  If you ever choose to become a vassal, or a rogue king, then it again allows for you to customize towns and villages, adds new nobility quests, special diplomacy options (not from the Diplomacy mod) and more.  If you want an overhaul mod that might buy the ticket, then try that."

These people fight the way they think people fight back in the day. In other words like they do in the movies. They pretty much have no clue how you fought. Which also is apparent in the original Mount and Blade.   The fighting in Mount and Blade is cool, but NOT historically correct. The biggest clue is the fact that the bowmen draw their arrow on the wrong side of the bow.. You don't move your arrow all the way over the bow and have it on the left side if you hold the bow in your left arm and draw it with your right.. And you usually don't slash at armored opponent, you try to poke their weak-points in their armor which is around the joints.. (totally haven't watched too many Skallagrim)  And the fact that you end up in large balls of people just hacking at each-other. Hopefully you can split up your army in groups and target different groups this time around so strategy gets more fun. Right now you can do some strategy in vanilla, but its mostly just when to charge.   Though sure, they get some stuff correct, everything isn't super wrong in the movies. Like Highlander for instance.  Edit; I'm sorry I'll be fine with inexperienced people doing the mocap. I'm sorry I had an opinion. lol"

mountandblade,3b8jmh,treygreen13,3,Fri Jun 26 21:01:56 2015 UTC,"To add to the information others have already given you there's a couple of places you can start adding productive enterprises early on for little cost: Brewery in Dhirim, Ironworks in Curaw, and Oil in Veluca, if I have those all right. There are others as well. Those offer good returns for the investment, and can help you make money early on before you can afford to put dyeworks up. You can always go and replace them with something else later once you have a lot of cash.  In general dyeworks are going to make you the most money in the majority of cities, but check the expected returns on everything before you start your business, it's not always the case. You can also get into the problem where you'll flood the market with too much of one item if you go all out on it, though this can take a while to happen. Building nothing but dyeworks and letting the items linger in a city while you slaughter every caravan you see will likely cause problems in the long run. If the market does crash, just switch some of your enterprises to other goods, and things will eventually calm down, though that can take a while too."
mountandblade,3b8jmh,someproteinguy,2,Fri Jun 26 22:10:25 2015 UTC,"If all else fails, a brewery generally works out too. Not as much potential for profit but it's fine early game."
mountandblade,3b8jmh,treygreen13,3,Fri Jun 26 23:50:03 2015 UTC,"You just buy it, and it'll start automatically giving you money every week (after a week for ""setting up the enterprise""). No further interaction needed. If you're at war with the faction the town is in, you won't get any income from that town for the duration of the war.  I recommend dyeworks for all of them (costs 10000 denars), and I generally buy one whenever I have 10000+2x(weekly army cost). Sometimes, ironworks has a greater payoff, so it's alright to invest in a couple, but any more would flush the market with iron and devaluate it."

mountandblade,3b8r5f,TrotsTwats,6,Fri Jun 26 22:01:19 2015 UTC,Mount & Blade Warband is Mount & Blade with new features. It is the far superior version of the game.
mountandblade,3b8r5f,treygreen13,2,Fri Jun 26 22:04:57 2015 UTC,"Four differences that I can think of:   You can now start your own kingdom in Warband; in standard M&B, you can only be a vassal. Multiplayer has been added. New Faction: the Sarranid Sultanate. Faction with desert territories, mamluke cavalry that is essentially a match for Swadian knights, good archers, and fairly crappy infantry. Warband gets some DLCs like Napoleonic Wars and Viking Conquest, and more mods.   Some people, though, think the the combat in the original Mount & Blade was better. I'm not sure exactly what the arguments are, and certainly some people think that Warband combat is better too, but I have heard the claim that original M&B had better combat for whatever reason.  Note that Warband is not really so much a sequel of Mount & Blade as an expanded version of it. It doesn't take place any ""later,"" in universe, after the events of M&B. It's story (insofar as M&B, either classic or Warband, has a story, rather than being a sandbox) is the same as M&B. Also, there are essentially no improvements of Warband over M&B in terms of graphics, mechanics, etc that I can think of. It's basically the same game with some added elements."

I put 5 points into looting so I got very good items and weapons, and by the end of my enlistment, I was very well off both monetarily and in terms of experience due to the sheer number of battles I had been in. Just join the winning faction in Lord Tyrell or somebody's army and you should be good."
mountandblade,3b6ske,italia06823834,4,Fri Jun 26 16:06:22 2015 UTC,"I would recommend trying to forge your own paths a bit early on. Make a name for yourself killing bands of bandits and entering tournaments.  Then you can go to a lord as a potential vassal, not an enlisted soldier. You can largely do what you want and help in the war efforts, even if the King sits at home while winning more renown and earning some lands.  For good lords kingdoms who generally do well (at least in my games), the Reach, Dorne, The North, or the Westerlands too (if you want to support those Lannister bastards).  Look into the quests Illyrio gives you in Essos and those you start in White Harbor as well (there are several). Good way to get started."

mountandblade,3b7tok,alaskafish,12,Fri Jun 26 17:46:54 2015 UTC,"There's not much information publically available outside of the few Dev Blogs and occasional AMA. Taleworlds is remaining very quite about the game and their progress on its development.     From the looks of it, it looks like it's just a more polished version of Warband: better graphics, better AI, better controls, ect. Plus, a new map, 'new' factions, new weapons, so forth.   That's how most sequels tend to work. Honestly, what you described up there is a lot more than you could expect from other franchises.   Warband is a fantastic game, so there's not a whole lot that needs to be drastically changed to make the sequel just as great.  From what we know, Taleworlds seem to be expanding in every department of the series from mod support all the way to immersive music and proper lore."
mountandblade,3b7tok,TrotsTwats,2,Fri Jun 26 17:57:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those mod tools look great, compared to the shitfest that is modding warband"
mountandblade,3b7tok,Gen_McMuster,5,Fri Jun 26 23:04:18 2015 UTC,"Well it looks like a polished Warband because they have literally teased the basics of a game. Nothing more. They have explained what resources they now have to make games and such, but little in terms of anything gameplay vice.  I believe the trading is going to be pretty much redone and added to. Its not like trading in itself is just another polish. From what I have seen you can barter and buy fiefs. And hopefully trading between AI is as important than your own(especially when you own towns and rely in that trade) So if someone is blockading you, its going to hurt.  But trading fiefs is pretty much literally all they have teased. They have a 3-5 times larger team this time around than Warband. Didn't bother to count the names in credit because a few of the guys did different things and was credited more than once.   If they stay true to the Mount and Blade and just simply polish and add instead of completely redefine the idea of Mount and Blade the game will be awesome. I'm sure some parts will be different because their scope(larger) and vision is sure to have changed since they made Warband."
mountandblade,3b7tok,fanzypantz,3,Fri Jun 26 17:58:00 2015 UTC,Mod/Mapping will be easier from the sounds of things which will increase the life span of the game by A LOT.
mountandblade,3b7tok,Hockeystyle,2,Fri Jun 26 18:58:30 2015 UTC,"Have you looked at any of the devblogs? There isn't a whole lot of information in them but they have shown a few new things like the bartering screen, as well as telling us they plan to overhaul the siege system.  You can take a look at them here."
mountandblade,3b7tok,Pineapple23,2,Fri Jun 26 18:40:20 2015 UTC,"I think they're purposefully secretive about it.   I wouldn't mind if it had ""just"" the features you mentioned (better graphs, better AI, better controls, a new map, more optimization, everything a bit polished). Warband is what it is because of the features it has, to improve upon those features is perfectly fine by me.   I imagine a lot of new troops, new armours, more intricate quests, perhaps a storyline system, spears actually fucking up the horses when they carge against it.   And of course, I expect a lot more detail on the lore since they seemed to hint that.   Stop making me thing about Bannerlord, man, it's 6 months away at best and I can't stay hype for 6 months without having a heart attack."
mountandblade,3b7tok,Hergyl,4,Fri Jun 26 20:00:06 2015 UTC,"Well by this logic,whats the difference between Morrowind,Oblivon,Skyrim?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Not to mention all Total War games."
mountandblade,3b7tok,Sea_Raider,7,Fri Jun 26 17:54:43 2015 UTC,"If you think that graphics and asset changes were the only difference between morrowind and skyrim, you haven't played much of either game."
mountandblade,3b7tok,marcelluspye,6,Fri Jun 26 18:01:05 2015 UTC,"better graphics, better AI, better controls, ect. Plus, a new map, 'new' factions, new weapons, so forth.                     To me that sounds like a whole different game,not just a repolished version,so i compared two games that are different by alot.And yes,i have played both ,Oblivion like 50 hours(even though a long time ago) and skyrim  about 100 hours."
mountandblade,3b7tok,Sea_Raider,2,Fri Jun 26 18:58:59 2015 UTC,"His point is that there are drastic differences between the Elder Scrolls games, beyond their maps, graphics and sounds... Morrowind had a dice-rolling system, directional attacking, spells that could fail to be cast and so on. Oblivion had real-time combat, power attacks, you could ride a horse. Skyrim had followers, loads of new spell effects (not to mention in previous games there was a load of changes to spell systems, including losing some), you could build a house with the Hearthfire DLC... those are huge differences, more than that - they each play differently, if Bannerlord is just shinier graphics and sounds, it's not really going to play and different, for better or worse - and that's fine, but you've got to wonder what else they could add or change."

mountandblade,3b4w0l,rulerguy6,2,Fri Jun 26 12:05:05 2015 UTC,I think if you besiege it enough so they don't have anymore supplies they might.  It's a wild guess though
mountandblade,3b4w0l,Domslord,3,Fri Jun 26 12:07:18 2015 UTC,"In Floris I made castles surrender when the garrison was small (under 100 troops) and I had a 250+ army.  They ask if we'll let them go unharmed, saying yes wins you the castle.   Usually it's a castle the faction just took and have not had the time to fill yet.  If it's one of their last castle they might say that ""they'll never leave So-and-so Castle"""
mountandblade,3b4w0l,b0ul,3,Fri Jun 26 12:31:32 2015 UTC,"I think (from experience) the tipping point is when you have three times as many troops as there are in the castle. Quality of the troops on both sides might matter somewhat, but I'm really not sure about that.   So with a 250 man force you are very likely to be able to use this method on an 80 man garrison, for instance.   If they won't do it at first, and you kill enough of them during assaults to get to this 3:1 ratio, you can still try it before you go on another assault.   I've mopped up a series of castles and a town in a matter of days in this way, as they had all been fiercely fought over by other factions recently.  Granted, I had a massive army stashed in a nearby town that I used bits of to garrison the places that I took. Still one of my most effective and non-violent campaigns though."

They aren't allowed to confirm or deny it, or King Harlaus will throw them in the dungeon to be buttered up and lain across the rack.  Personally, I don't give a toss for it. M&B is a personal experience. I don't want anybody coming in and ruining that, and it doesn't seem like something Taleworlds should waste their time and money doing it just because some people want their dumb little buddies to try and gawk at their work, then end up being silent as they play the game on their own anyway, because we're all selfish bastards.  tosses two cents"

As /u/TrotsTwats summed it up:   By neither confirming or denying it, they're keeping it on the table while still hyping the community up that it could be in Bannerlord.   That is the takeaway here - that TW is not committing one way or the other, and that we shouldn't assume anything about the inclusion until we get a clearer official notice that confirms or denies it outright."

mountandblade,3b2c1e,MrWendal,17,Thu Jun 25 13:12:35 2015 UTC,"Strategus in cRPG was (is?) an attempt of making a multiplayer campaign. It basically turned into multiplayer battles with more meaning. Coop campaigns though could probably be doable, but movement speed on the map, as well as the time it would take for battles to finish when no player would be involved would have to take a lot longer. A freelancer option would probably also be doable I guess. One player being the main player, and any additional players would be companions in that player's army, and for them the game would be like freelancer, except you can't get leave or resign from the army."

mountandblade,3b2c1e,WiseOctopus,15,Thu Jun 25 15:01:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think people are understanding how a Co-op would work. It has been tried in mods before and they all run into the same problem, what breaks them from being good (at all).  Every single battle someone else takes will mean you sit there paused for 15-30 min on the campaign map. Every time you want to fast forward the game because you're regenerating in a town you'll have to go at normal speed if the other guy is slowly trying to outmaneuver bandits. The game will randomly pause for you whenever whoever is playing with you looks at a menu, whenever he enters a scene it will pause for a long time. You're looking at probably triple the time in between fighting and such because of this, most of it just staring at an unmoving screen.  Co-op only would work in if the second player is a companion to the first. This is highly underwhelming compared to what people what to see, and the second player would actually be doing nothing until a battle happens. Even this is kind of unwieldy.  The third option is what is already in mods, co-op battles. Fight with other people against either AI or other players. Of course they could add ""invite a friend"" as an option into custom battles, but people rarely use thoughts as each battle doesn't have significance or progression ascribed to it as in singleplayer.  None of these issues can be truly ameliorated, they are intrinsic to how the game functions. Perhaps you could ""invite a friend as companion"" on the battle screen in single player, but then they would still have to be sitting around waiting for it, and it still wouldn't be their game/save they're playing. Perhaps you could add micromanagement for the companion player in the meantime, but it still would just be a diluted version of single player with a friend in battles.  Co-op sandbox play in mount and blade is simply unfeasible, best it's left at single battles on multiplayer/co-op servers."
mountandblade,3b2c1e,Specolar,11,Thu Jun 25 15:40:31 2015 UTC,"None of this seems all that challenging to me.   Every single battle someone else takes will mean you sit there paused for 15-30 min on the campaign map.   Prompt the other player to choose between being involved by controlling a follower, spectating, or doing a limited number of other actions and then waiting the rest out.   Every time you want to fast forward the game because you're regenerating in a town you'll have to go at normal speed if the other guy is slowly trying to outmaneuver bandits.   You could first eliminate the need/desire to do this, even if only in the coop version.  The next option would be to allow a time tolerance where each player can be a day or two apart before they have to wait to sync up.  This could stretch farther based on how far apart they are on the map.   The game will randomly pause for you whenever whoever is playing with you looks at a menu, whenever he enters a scene it will pause for a long time.   Just no.  Why would this have to be the case?   You're looking at probably triple the time in between fighting and such because of this, most of it just staring at an unmoving screen.   Even still, I'd take it.  My son and I would enjoy playing this game together, cooperatively."
mountandblade,3b2c1e,PersonFromYourStory,3,Thu Jun 25 15:45:39 2015 UTC,"Just no. Why would this have to be the case?   Because you could get up to all kinds of exploits if you got out of sync. It's not really a problem though, just make it so the menus don't actually pause the action.   You could first eliminate the need/desire to do this, even if only in the coop version. The next option would be to allow a time tolerance where each player can be a day or two apart before they have to wait to sync up. This could stretch farther based on how far apart they are on the map.   How do you eliminate the desire though? You can't have players heal instantly after battle (well, you could, but not without ruining the balance). How else can players heal themselves without it being unfair? And how exactly do players wait to sync up? That doesn't solve the problem. Player 1 wants to wait in town 5 days to heal up. Player 2 wants to chase down a group of bandits. How do you keep both players happy?"
mountandblade,3b2c1e,Mr_Magpie,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:17:26 2015 UTC,"You can't have players heal instantly after battle (well, you could, but not without ruining the balance).    It would require that campaign to be balanced differently, yes.  And that might ruin it for some.  But it would be a decent tradeoff and people who were unhappy could be redirected to the single player experience.  It's all about a perspective shift.  Can you have the exact same experience without making any concessions?  Clearly not.  Could you modify some things and still come away with a coop game that's clearly Mount and Blade?  Of course."
mountandblade,3b2c1e,davy_crockett,4,Thu Jun 25 19:16:56 2015 UTC,I think the problem is they don't want to make it too different from the single player campaign. It's hard to balance both without the quality of one of them suffering.
mountandblade,3b2c1e,Bismarckian,0,Thu Jun 25 19:18:38 2015 UTC,"Co-op only would work in if the second player is a companion to the first. This is highly underwhelming compared to what people what to see, and the second player would actually be doing nothing until a battle happens. Even this is kind of unwieldy.   I think a variation based off of this could work rather well. Have it so that the players are separate but need to stay relatively grouped up similar to the ""grand hosts"" the Marshall assembles. As for some other problems, they could be handled as such (assuming 2 players):   Moving on the map: It should be a joint decision on where to go between the players as they need to stay together Visiting a town: Both players enter the town and can do whatever they want separately but they can't leave until both decide to leave (the first one to say leave just idles in the town until the other leaves as well). Entering combat: this would be handled similar to entering a combat with a friendly AI lord around. The second player and their army is automatically brought in as an ally to help out the first player.   They key thing to make it work is good communication between the players similar to games like Dota or LoL."

mountandblade,3b5m1u,Thamanizer,2,Fri Jun 26 09:59:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah it would be really cool I imagine, but I feel that it's an easy thing to oversimplify.  I agree with all your points, I much prefer Warband's combat over any MMO I've played, but it would probably require a lot of work for them to make any game like this.  Persistent World, as others have said, is probably the closest thing to this at the moment, but the world map is often not that big compared to any MMO and it doesn't have the same scale as one."
mountandblade,3b5m1u,TipTopToby,2,Fri Jun 26 10:28:59 2015 UTC,"Excellent post. Very comprehensive and pragmatic.   The reason it wouldn't work is simple: it wouldn't be sustainable. I can honestly say that around 70% of the MMOs I played are either dead or dying. I'm not a great gamer but not quite a casual.   The trick to making money is to give something to casual players (CS:GO, CoD, WoW although the latter has only been casual-tier for the past 5 years or so) something simple they can master in little time.   The Warband market is a niche market. I study history and the only people I know IRL who play Warband are colleagues of mine. Chivalry was a good attempt (and despite most people who play M&B hating it, I enjoy the game) but it's still something of a reserved market. At any given time, the average amount of people playing Chivalry is 5k, playing Warband is 10k. Then the average for CS:GO is 450k, for TF2 is 65k. DOTA 2 has an average of 500k. Of these games I only play with some regularity CS:GO (besides Warband and Chivalry, of course).   It's just not rewarding enough to make an MMO that's purely skill based. Warband is very skill based, look at the MP and you'll see for yourself. People want shortcuts, want something easy, something that they can learn and master in a week. Considering the investment that goes into making an MMO, it wouldn't profit. Taking risks like these today is not recommendable. If an MMO based on Warhammer dies after 5 years (especially considering the following Warhammer has even today), an MMO based on Warband would certainly have the same fate.   Oden knows I'd kill for a Calradia MMO, but it's just not happening."

mountandblade,3b5m1u,Shitpoe_Sterr,6,Fri Jun 26 07:54:14 2015 UTC,There's also cRPG. I'd consider that MMO-ish because it implements the levelling system and trading rare items in typical MMO fashion.

But you have to aim yourself, some mage spell I think you can lock on like some healing spells. But you still need to aim to lock on. There are monsters on Tera, WOW, and quite a lot of MMO's can can instant kill you if you are doing stupid stuff, especially the larger monsters. In Tera these large monsters are everywhere. sure. though you are wrong about stats. You do get advantages with higher tactics and higher morale. Especially in those mods that makes tops run away if say their leader gets killed or something else that will make their morale go rock bottom. In other words, there are stats that impact your battle.  Have you used an super high lvl guy in SP, they are godlike? Sure its not that way in MP for a reason, but if you make a Warband style MMO you kind of have to include levels or there are no reason to work on your character at all which is a big thing in the SP game."

mountandblade,3b5m1u,wheatjesus,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:13:23 2015 UTC,"I think there's a few reasons I personally think it wouldn't work    MMO graphics are cartoony because having a lot of players in one area (stormwind in WoW for example) can be really graphically demanding.  MMO combat is usually point and click simple because bad connections, bad servers, or just too many players in an instance can make things laggy and janky which would ruin combat as precise as warband.    The only reason MP really works in warband is the scenes aren't very intensive. Having a big open 3D mmo world might mess that up. The gameplay might suck too, unless you still got to lead armies (which would be crazy demanding on performance) the combat would get stale and there wouldn't be much of a point to playing without any kind of progression. Best case scenario it would devolve into arena pvp which is what we already have."
mountandblade,3b3cpt,Konig91,42,Thu Jun 25 17:09:42 2015 UTC,I find it's even crazier when you're on horseback. One of my favourite styles of play is a khergit horse archer with a 100% cavalry army.

You basically get more ammo at the expense of adaptability. I messed around with it once, I can't remember how it went though."
mountandblade,3b3cpt,poleis,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:30:13 2015 UTC,"I have, yeah, but it's still just not enough. At most you can get like 12-15 good throwing weapons doing that using THREE of your slots :("
mountandblade,3b3cpt,Paeyvn,3,Fri Jun 26 05:43:41 2015 UTC,"If you want to go pure thrower/2hander, you can get about 18 javelins with 3 slots of 6; each of which take half hp from a plated foe with a chest shot and a 1 hit kill with a headshot. However you can get better results with, a far more accurate, 60 good arrows and powerful bow which can deliver much more overall damage and DPS. Throwing just isn't viable as a min/maxing strategy, only as a secondary for shielding infantry. Hopefully Bannerlord makes it so that throwing weapons have a larger impact on the battlefield and in terms of logistics, as it was in the dark ages."
mountandblade,3b3cpt,Alexander_Baidtach,2,Fri Jun 26 07:24:40 2015 UTC,"A lot of throwing weapons (notably the roman pilla) were hardly even meant to kill. A huge reason for using them was they would get stuck in shields and the enemy would have to drop them. Not only that, having a spear thrown at you is a big thing, I mean look at javelins, they're pretty big. They should make an opponent stop or stutter at the least, some sort of momentum should be given to the thrower."
mountandblade,3b3cpt,Avagantamos101,2,Fri Jun 26 15:45:36 2015 UTC,I think a massive multiplier against shields and to a lesser extent heavy armor would be a fair change. Stagger effects would be nice... I like how you think
mountandblade,3b3cpt,lavalampmaster,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:27:32 2015 UTC,It's best when you are defending. You pull the javelins that the enemy throw and get stuck in the walls right back down on them.

I abhor archers in this type of game so much it's ridiculous. Especially on MP.  I remember once we playing on a teams deathmatch, first to reach 300 kills wins. 32v32. Around 24 of the enemy team was composed by archers and they didn't just stand in formation, they actively sought us out from all angles to the point where a shield was completely useless. It was traumatic."

mountandblade,3b2yua,Haxld,13,Thu Jun 25 15:26:29 2015 UTC,"Always on full damage, its the only way I feel a sense of progression. At the beginning, being knocked out by stray arrows,or attempting to take on too many looters solo is encouragement to work towards better armor. Piece by piece, you upgrade your armor, each time becoming more and more powerful. By late game you have full lordly plate and become a god, carving through hoards of enemies alone (till a couched lance hits you for 300).  If you play on low damage, there is no reason to work towards good armor and no sense of progression."
mountandblade,3b2yua,MrLeppy,13,Thu Jun 25 21:56:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, sometimes its terrifying, particularly at low level with scant armor.

mountandblade,3b2yua,Abnorc,2,Mon Jun 29 21:44:17 2015 UTC,"Is it a must? Probably not. If you have a rig that can handle it most people push it up to 250-350. It makes things more interesting. Sieges are also harder when you are attacking because there will be more men guarding the ladder so you cant just get thru the first batch and spawn kill the rest. Sometimes a high battle size will make ai pathfinding goof up during field battles depending on what module you are playing. They can fight fine but they dont just advamce forward, they'll line up and walk in circles around the map slower getting closer to you, eventually they may start colliding into the map edges, making their calvary dismount and/or retreat. This only happens when the enemy has large numbers though, and if you position your men right you can make the enemey fight you before it gets too fucky. I think certain modules fix this, can't recall which ones though."

Her army is trained to terrifying extremes; but in battle they stand to one side, firing bolts around her as she wades unflinchingly through the sea of enemies, leaving only death in her wake. She has ended the lives of hundreds, some say thousands, choking on their last breath, as their life's blood drips down her blade. She has taken armies, cities, kings against impossible odds, her legendary unstoppability spreading terror in the ranks of any unfortunate enough to be called her foe.

Once I got the basics down I upped it up and know that I sort of k of my way around stuff I play on 102% which is every one 1:1 damage ration and good battle ai.   The funny thing about this game is that ""Hard Mode"" is merely removing the player advantages.  You become and equal and play by the same rules as your enemies. Not doing things this way makes everything feel cheap. I'm not saying the everyone should do it but to me if I'm not playing with normal damage might as well enable cheats. It's faster anyway to do it like that.   Sure sometimes you will get frustrated because you were caught out of position with wounded troops or whatever, but that's what makes the game so gripping. It's really is a cruel world filled with bandits, raiders, slavers, heretics, rogue knights, deserters, and plenty of scum looking to make a quick denar. Losing everything and start again might feel bad at first but it's part of the tale your character is living. How he failed and then overcame. Might be fun the first few times to run careless at the enemy barely raking damaged because you are playing on very easy, but to me that got old fast.   Playing with normal damage all the way feels amazing once to reach the point where you can go toe to toe with the lords of the realm. It's much more satisfying."

mountandblade,3b40cw,TrotsTwats,5,Thu Jun 25 20:08:31 2015 UTC,"No, you can not run them together. Both of these mods are full conversions upon the Native game, so they have tons of custom assets (weapons, armours, scenes, etc.) and features that couldn't work together.  Floris adds lots of Norse-themed armours for the Nord faction, so it would be worth having a look if you're interested in staying in Calradia."
mountandblade,3b40cw,TrotsTwats,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:11:23 2015 UTC,"Great, thanks!  But now i'm confused which one i should choose... Where i can see Brytenwalda\VC comparison? Or if you can, tell me please."
mountandblade,3b40cw,TrotsTwats,8,Thu Jun 25 20:14:58 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, both mods were made by the same team. Brytenwalda being the first before moving onto VC.  Both mods add lots of new items and features compared to the Native game. Both take place in Europe, and allow you to choose who you play as (different races, heights, religion, etc.)  Upon launch, VC was riddled with game breaking bugs and errors. For the most part, these have been fixed and the game can be pretty enjoyable. Something unique about the mod is it features a story mode, ship battles, the ability to make your own settlements, and interactive towns. It's recently gone into Beta for a new update so you could either wait for the new version or jump in now.  Brytenwalda is a more traditional M&B mod that adds a lot upon the Native game. In my opinion, Brytenwalda is the more balanced, finished, and polished mod between the two. With that said, I haven't played VC since launch, but I hear recently it has received a lot of attention from the devs. You could easily get lots of fun out of it, especially considering you enjoy Vikings.    Brytenwalda is a free mod, so I recommend starting with that. If you like it and have an itch for more, get VC when it goes on sale (I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price)."

I'd watch a few gameplay videos(or read their overviews at least) to get a feel for the tone. Brytenwalda for instance is more historical in nature and has a higher amount of hard to pronounce words.  Different time periods too, Brytenwalda is pre norse invasion(like the show), so the map mainly revolves around saxon/briton/pict squabbles early on, still plenty of axes and raiding to be done. While VC has the Danlaw(danish kingdoms) already established in Northumbria, East Anglia, a splot of Ireland and in Friesea across the channel. IMHO, having vikingy factions to pledge to on the main continent(britain) makes for a bit more fun gameplay(and it actually lets you raid via longboat)"
mountandblade,3b40cw,jav099,2,Fri Jun 26 23:12:41 2015 UTC,"oh, nice! thank you for those advices!  i played Brytenwalda, and i found it a little bit overwhelmed, like so many 'everything', but i think i'm gonna figure out everything"
mountandblade,3b40cw,usuno,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:17:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that mod expects a bit of knowledge of the period, but it's easy enough to style your character as a norse warrior for hire then fight as a merc, irrc stealing cattle as a merc is a good way to get started(don't start shit with peasants by raiding in the early game, found that out the hard way)  If you're interested in VC. Keep in mind it's pretty hard in the early game(last I played) compared to vannila. Fresh recruits from villages are trash(until youre high enough level for the ""trainer"" skill to work) and most bandits along the english coasts are sea-raider levels of hardass but have great loot.   You can get good early money by buying goods from villages on the cheap and selling them in towns for stupidly high profits(timber/furs in Norway, Salt in Friesia, wool from anywhere). For early troops stick to mead halls(like mercenaries in vannilla, only better value), watchmen and spearmen are cheap and once you meat the renown requirement, svear warriors and veterans are great well armored troops, though they are slightly worse than their faction specific equivalents. There's also a campaign, the beginning of which acts as a nice tutorial for making your way through sandbox mode(specifically the naval combat) Again, I haven't played VC in some time and I'm unsure what Reforged has changed(you can opt into the beta, there's a link on this sub's frontpage for info) so these strategies may not be as effective as they used to be."
mountandblade,3b40cw,Castle_Walls,2,Fri Jun 26 23:35:15 2015 UTC,"damn, i have none of it, except what i've seen from Vikings TV show and something that i could hear when i was almost-listening on history classes...  yeah, accepted quest where i need to provoke war... was a bad idea, peasents killing all my recruits easily  great, thank you for information!"
mountandblade,3b40cw,Castle_Walls,2,Fri Jun 26 23:54:15 2015 UTC,"VC is made by the people who made Brytenwalda, so VC is higher quality but costs money.  I'd say go for VC."

So you have to start up the windows version once to automatically create the saved game folder in your Mac documents folder under M&B save games, then copy and paste the save files from your Mac saved games folder which is in your steam folder somewhere IIRC.

mountandblade,3b4jk4,jav099,2,Thu Jun 25 22:24:00 2015 UTC,"To answer your first question, the only reason might want to stick with Swadia is because it helps to become friends with the majority of lords in your faction. If they like you and if you have high right to rule, then they would most likely join you once you start a faction. So I would give you the answer of, stay with your faction if you don't have very many friends and a right to rule under 20, or if you have many cooperative or friendly lords, and a right to rule at 20 or above, then I suggest you start a faction. If you have trouble understanding all the benefits of being king, then I suggest watching a couple videos on the matter or visiting the forums. To answer your second question, Marshall had a couple key benefits such as having an extra 25 spots in your army for troops, lords will follow you if you wish to take action and if I'm not mistaken I think it also raises your leadership by 1 as long as you are Marshall. The disadvantage to being Marshall is gaining controversy for every loss your faction faces, so it will be undesirable to be Marshall if you are fighting on two fronts. Hopefully that helps friend:)"

You'll need to do some quests for us to raise your relation, and even then it'll take a while to reach beloved.   :)  More seriously, the ideas above sound great. From my few months on the sub, I'd say the community needs may include things like an expanded guides section, a more current modules list (as you mentioned), and some better / more visible resources for new players. Resurrecting ""Tutorial Tuesday"" as Ashley mentioned in another comment would really help, too.   Community multiplayer events would be fun. I've barely scratched the surface of MP, and having a coordinated group of players to get involved with would probably help get more of us into it.  As far as the subreddit itself, implementing post flair tags might be a helpful way to categorize content so people can more easily find the posts they're interested in. That said, the sub isn't so busy (currently) that it's difficult to sort through threads, but in the future (with Bannerlord) that might change. Once the flairs are enabled, you can have links that just list posts with those tags, so they act as automated search categories. As I mentioned in the mod recruiting thread, if you ever need a hand with back-end features like that, I'm happy to help answer questions and the like.   Speaking of which, if you two haven't installed RES and Modtoolbox yet, I'd highly recommend doing so. They'll make basic moderating tasks way easier and more efficient."
mountandblade,3b15p6,average_fan_guy,4,Thu Jun 25 12:08:55 2015 UTC,Consider bringing the pvp scene closer to us. Perhaps a monthly update or at least pvp primer where we could learn about some techniques we never heard of (I only learned about chambering about a month ago).
mountandblade,3b15p6,Sea_Raider,3,Thu Jun 25 11:35:19 2015 UTC,I second this. As a new player I'm a bit terrified of even trying the mp since I know the combat is way different from sp. Having some highlights on tips and tricks and the primer session would do a lot to get me playing.

mountandblade,3aytx9,Ameri-KKK-aSucksMan,8,Wed Jun 24 19:55:03 2015 UTC,"I don't have the code, obviously, but there's some randomization of what refined products each city produces (similar to the randomization of stats for each unit). The result of this is that some games will have more non-player dyeworks, which will make player-controlled ones much less lucrative. On the other hand, some games will have next to no dyeworks outside of Jelkala, which will make them much more valuable. Because there are relatively few automatic dyeworks, the effects of this randomization are felt more strongly in the velvet market than in, say, the pottery one. This is also why, while certain trade routes will always be good (like salt along the north coast), other ones might be great in one game and marginal in another."

Begin completing ""Hunt the Bandits"" quests from Guild Masters for 1000d apiece. Pillage enemy villages whenever we're at war, pray to the Butter Gods for the Floris glitch.

Become Nord vassal, start with poor village, work to increase prosperity. Eventually start earning ~800d each week. Hire ~20 Manhunters as my cavalry division, begin career as slave-trader freelance justicar, capturing bandit armies and selling them to Ransom Brokers for 3000-5000d each trip.  Buy Dyeworks in Sargoth and Werecheg.  Continue looting enemy villages as the occasion permits, use money to buy productive enterprises when lucrative to do so.  Become lord of two more villages, add their revenue to my weekly total. Build Watch Towers so I can defend them more easily.  Continue freelance justice-bringing to cleanse the land of craven bandits. Profit accordingly. Lay siege to castle and take it successfully without any aid; get awarded possession of castle by liege, begin earning additional ~1000d each week as prosperity increases.  Eventually get awarded the city of Uxhal, and then the money really starts pouring in.    Despite significant expenses for garrisons and my personal army, I generally pull in about 5,000d each week, sometimes up to 10,000d if I garrison my more expensive troops or lay off unnecessary military. That adds up pretty quickly if you're not actively spending it on recruiting, patrols, improvements, gear, etc. Part of it is that most of my more expensive outlays are already done - I literally can't buy better armor or weapons anymore. The only significant purchase I could make at this point is a better horse, but I'd need Riding 6 or higher, so right now that's unnecessary."
mountandblade,3aytx9,kacman,2,Wed Jun 24 17:39:30 2015 UTC,How do you keep money in coffers instead of on your person?
mountandblade,3aytx9,Super_Jay,5,Wed Jun 24 18:20:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should have been clearer - that's a Floris / Diplomacy feature that is accessed via the Chamberlain. You can access your chamberlain in the center of any village you control, or in the keep of a city or castle that you control."
mountandblade,3aytx9,DenimDave,2,Wed Jun 24 19:23:09 2015 UTC,Is the Floris mod on Steam?
mountandblade,3aytx9,Super_Jay,3,Thu Jun 25 20:45:17 2015 UTC,"No, try NexusMods or ModDB, its available for download on both sites."
mountandblade,3aytx9,DenimDave,2,Thu Jun 25 23:56:22 2015 UTC,Okay. Thanks! Any reason no one has posted it in Steam Workshop?
mountandblade,3aytx9,Super_Jay,2,Fri Jun 26 01:11:20 2015 UTC,I'm guessing because it's probably much too large. :)
mountandblade,3aytx9,ghostdate,2,Fri Jun 26 02:54:23 2015 UTC,"How do you get these mercenary jobs and bandit hunting options?  I usually just spend the first little while killing dudes to steal their stuff and sell it, and then enter a tournament and bet on myself, because tournaments are piss easy unless you get into a 1v1 and get stuck with a bow and arrow versus pretty much any other weapon. That's bullshittiest thing, bow shouldn't even be an option for 1v1. Anyways, doing that a few times nets me enough money to get a decent size army going for a while. As soon as you become a vassal you get shit all out of tournaments though, I guess it's probably related to your renown."
mountandblade,3aytx9,Super_Jay,2,Thu Jun 25 02:18:30 2015 UTC,"How do you get these mercenary jobs and bandit hunting options?   Once you get a certain amount of Renown - maybe 100? - you get the option to enter into a mercenary contract by talking to the King or the Marshal of a faction, IIRC. You sign up to serve under contract for a period of 30 days, during which they pay your wages (upkeep) for your army, plus a little extra. You still have to pay initial costs when hiring, but the kingdom foots the bill for all wages, which is nice as you don't have to worry about growing your army too large for you to afford. As the leader of a merc band, you're effectively considered an ally of the kingdom, so their enemies are your enemies and you'll be attacked by anyone with which they're at war. (The reverse is also true, though, and that's how I got a lot of my early cash, just pillaging Vaegir villages while the Nord vassals actually fought the war. What can I say, I'm not above being opportunistic.)   Bandit hunting quests come from Guild Masters in cities. There are two flavors: ""Track Down the Bandits"" and ""Deal with troublesome bandits.""  The former is the one that has you trying to find a specific bandit group between the current city and another city, sometimes quite far off. You can track these down by talking to other lords on the road, to caravans, travelling farmers, etc. I didn't personally find these to be too hard, and at 1000d apiece they were surprisingly lucrative in the early game.  (The ""Deal with troublesome bandits"" quests are similar but tended to have the bandits spawning close to the city. I didn't do those that much b/c the payout was pretty low, just 200-300d, I think.)   Since I've been playing Floris since I started Warband, the Tournaments were much different than Native and a lot harder. I participated in them but never made much money off them at all, though I have heard others say the same, that they're a good source of cash in the early game for Native players."
mountandblade,3aytx9,thefeint,2,Thu Jun 25 03:33:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't personally find these to be too hard, and at 1000d apiece they were surprisingly lucrative in the early game.   I've been able to complete this style of quest maybe 50% of the time... it seems like a random existing bandit/deserter group is selected as the target for this quest, when it spawns. If there is a bandit camp for that bandit type, there is a good chance that your target will patrol through in the near future. If there isn't, the group could wander literally anywhere on the map. And if it's a group of deserters, let alone deserters on mounts, forget about it."
mountandblade,3aytx9,Super_Jay,3,Thu Jun 25 17:37:34 2015 UTC,"Sure, yeah - there's a reason why those quests aren't universally recommended. They can be annoying, but in my mind, why not pick them up? You don't lose anything for failing,  and if you have it in your journal, you can just ask other travelers about it as you move around the map and go about your other business. If you find and defeat the bandits, awesome - you just earned 1000d. If not, oh well, you're no worse off than you were before. There's no real downside to it, AFAIK, and in the early game they're among the most lucrative quests I'd found."
mountandblade,3aytx9,thefeint,3,Thu Jun 25 17:58:12 2015 UTC,"It's funny, I have never gotten any information from asking around about the bandits' locations before - it's always ""no, I've not seen anyone that fits that description."" To the point where I thought it was just a dummy option, and the real work comes from wandering around the map and hoping to bump into them. I did discover that having a high enough Tracking skill will make the tracks of your target identify as unique, when you hover over them!"
mountandblade,3aytx9,Super_Jay,2,Thu Jun 25 19:53:04 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, yeah that's a drag. I got lucky with my first few and happened to get some tips as to the bandits' current location, so they weren't that bad. The biggest oversight on these quests is that if you don't pay attention to the quest text from the Guild Master, you'll miss the destination city and won't have any idea of the intended search area. (He may say ""between here [Sargoth] and Praven,"" for example, but Praven is never mentioned in your quest journal after that point.)"
mountandblade,3aytx9,Highw4ySt4r,2,Thu Jun 25 20:29:09 2015 UTC,How profitable your villages are is all random. If you get a village on the front lines with an enemy faction then it'll be perma-looted and it'll never develop.
mountandblade,3aytx9,Super_Jay,13,Wed Jun 24 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"How profitable your villages are is all random.   No, it isn't. But you're correct, if you don't do anything to protect your holdings and you allow them to be razed repeatedly, they'll have a hard time becoming prosperous. Shocking, I know."
mountandblade,3aytx9,Highw4ySt4r,10,Wed Jun 24 17:52:33 2015 UTC,Good job protecting them AND doing anything else. The second you join a marshals campaign you'll have to leave it undefended and it's back to square one.
mountandblade,3aytx9,Super_Jay,3,Wed Jun 24 17:59:39 2015 UTC,"Hire guard patrols to help keep villages safe, get other lords to run security detail around my holdings, trade fiefs with fellow vassals to remove border threats, etc. Yes, once in a while your villages can get raided and yes, that's a part of the game, but that doesn't mean it's unavoidable and constant and it doesn't mean you're impotent about it unless you choose to be."
mountandblade,3aytx9,Highw4ySt4r,2,Wed Jun 24 19:19:26 2015 UTC,Well there are diminishing returns with trying to develop villages. I find my income is better if I ignore defending them - and just go out cracking skulls. I make more being an adventurer than trying to guard stuff.
mountandblade,3aytx9,franzieperez,7,Wed Jun 24 19:23:13 2015 UTC,Prosperity helps build relationship. Good enough relationship and the village becomes a fantastic supply of higher tier troops for next to nothing.
mountandblade,3aytx9,fanzypantz,3,Wed Jun 24 19:35:55 2015 UTC,"you could help them to get more prosperous to like getting cattle and helping them train against bandits and other such quests. I took Werchech or whatever its called first and my two villages up there Raven and the one starting with ""o"" generate over 860 each. Almost as much as Werchech... Its sick.   Though that area always get Sea raiders which is annoying to deal with all the time. very protected from anything else if you aren't at war with the Veagris."

mountandblade,3aytx9,ShakemasterNixon,6,Wed Jun 24 17:45:56 2015 UTC,"To be clear, this isn't the way to make money, it's just one way, and I mostly improvised as I went along. As another response suggested, you could also focus exclusively on enterprises in cities and on trade routes. I don't really enjoy trading, so I focused more on finding ways that I could do the stuff I enjoy - building armies and fighting battles - and make that profitable. Hence the bandit-capturing expeditions, razing villages, guild master quests to remove hostile raiders, taking holdings from enemy lords, etc."
mountandblade,3aytx9,ShakemasterNixon,6,Wed Jun 24 17:55:50 2015 UTC,"If you just want to focus on hoarding money and buying shops, I'd suggest renouncing your allegiance and going freelance. Participate in tournaments for a fat stack of starting capital, and then run trade routes while constantly dumping excess funds into new shops in any cities you haven't set one up.  The hardest part is the first four or five. After that you could feasibly downsize your army and just wait for weeks at a time while cash flows in. The second half of the cities will be bought on a weekly basis more than likely, because every week your income will be so huge that you can outright buy a new one with the excess funds.  Please note I'm talking in terms of vanilla, unmodded game (Diplomacy and other non-economic mods not included). Game mods can drastically alter the way the economy works, so my advice may not apply."

mountandblade,3aytx9,stickgore,2,Wed Jun 24 17:37:45 2015 UTC,"I haven't played Floris a ton, and especially not recently. My initial guess would be yes, but just observe the markets and see what each town makes a lot of, especially in raw materials. If they make a lot of a particular raw material, they'll usually be profitable in producing its finished good, especially if they don't make much of it themselves."

I just roam around taking out sea raiders and forest bandits for the first 25-40 days. Get prison management to about 4 and start watching the denars flow as you sell loot and slaves all around Calradia. Usually around day 40, I pick a faction that I don't particularly like and begin raiding its villages and picking off its weaker lords for ransom (or just for looting gear if I'm worried about reputation that playthrough). You should be loaded withe denars by the time you're ready to join a faction by about day 100. Plus you'll have some nicely geared and leveled up companions."

mountandblade,3b21aq,DeathbyDingbat,2,Thu Jun 25 18:31:15 2015 UTC,"Mages are OP or at least they were when I played, and that was after they toned them down. I was holding off several Nord armies back to back with just my one army of mostly mages.  In fact, all the new units are OP compared to the base game's units. There is little reason to recruit any but them. An army of dwarf infantry, elven archers, and mages (with some clerics for good measure) can take out most everything else. And those damn valkyries. Golems too.  If you are not evil, you can still grab the demon units and throw them in your garrisons. Balrogs FTW.  As of the last time I played, you can auto-resolve on the immortals and end up winning, capturing them, and recruiting them. It's gamey and save-scummy, but there it is.  If you're going to be in combat, the sword that refills your health on hit is a good choice. I was using it to strafe the enemy lines to distract them while my mages laid it on them and it kept me topped off pretty well.  I'm no expert, but those are a few things I've noticed in my playthrough. ReformistTM has a necromancer and a cleric playthrough on YouTube that are good to watch."

You'll need to learn how to block, and not with a shield.   If he spams you can block him and make a quick attack. You can attack faster after the block then he can with his second attack. A very good counter but really hard to pull off is chambering (look it up on the forums), basically attack a moment after he attacks so your sword move also blocks him, but you have to time it perfectly. You can't really play defensive in this game, hiding behind a shield, you must actually do something. Ditch the shield and just learn to block with a weapon, it's essential to the game."

Then practice some more.  -Be unpredictable.  If you come at me in the same manner, I will always kill you in the same manner.  Be sneaky, dirty, and underhanded.  Accept that honor on the battlefield is for corpses.  If you don't embrace that fact, you'll be killed by someone that does.  -Know your class' strength and weaknesses.  Archers are good for support, and are vicious when using terrain to their advantage.  Put them in the open and they're screwed.  Cavalry are great for open terrain, and are the best for sneak attacks (if the enemy sees you coming, you're playing them wrong).  Infantry are good against cavalry (if you have a polearm.  Get a polearm), and can defeat archers if they close the distance (shields are vital).  -Work with your teammates, and watch their backs.  Use them to your advantage, and you'll all be winners.  Remember to be sneaky.  If you see one of your teammates dueling with an enemy, you can either be worthless and crowd your friend, or be insanely useful by sneaking up behind the enemy.  -Know the terrain.  Map memorization isn't quite as important as it is for most FPS', but knowing how terrain works is a huge advantage.  If you're an archer, go somewhere horses have a hard time following.  If you're cavalry, stick to open areas, and take cover if there's an archer somewhere you can't get to.  I could go on for days, but this is a start."

mountandblade,3b2m5o,bloodsuka,-2,Thu Jun 25 15:58:18 2015 UTC,"Personally, this game is awesome for single player, and rather dull for multiplayer. If you want a really good multiplayer medieval game (I'm going to get so much shit and downvotes for this) I recommend Chivalry: MW.   The combat in that game is simply perfect. The learning curve is there, and it suffers from a similar issue to M&B that many players LOVE LOVE LOVE that game so they've been playing it for 1000-4000 hours and still play it because it's so good. Though it is surprisingly still very alive and brings in new players all the time with free weekends and steam sales. There are ""low level"" servers which are constantly full for you to get your toes wet."
mountandblade,3b2m5o,DoubleJesusPower,4,Thu Jun 25 16:57:14 2015 UTC,"In Chivalry, making your character twitch to gain an advantage is even more important than M&B:W... It's really not that fun and it gets dull quickly. Multiplayer was what attracted me the most in Warband, it's incredibly skill-based and interesting."
mountandblade,3b2m5o,teachmehowtopleb,3,Thu Jun 25 17:08:10 2015 UTC,"Turn speed is capped during a swing, so no twitch really has nothing to do with it. Not even allowed, really.  To each their own, I guess. I know posting a pro-Chivalry point of view in r/m&b is gonna have disagreements."
mountandblade,3b2m5o,DoubleJesusPower,4,Thu Jun 25 17:11:10 2015 UTC,Yeah well chivalry is a dumbed down version of warband MP for the plebs who can't figure out manual blocking.
mountandblade,3b2m5o,CRANIEL,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:40:05 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to turn this into a chiv vs. warband debate but I feel compelled to rebuttal. The argument can be made that while warband has 4 directional blocking, Chivalry has free blocking, thus an infinite number of directions to block. More realistically, it's about 9 or so directions"
mountandblade,3b2m5o,DoubleJesusPower,2,Thu Jun 25 22:33:37 2015 UTC,"And that's only 1 part of the combat system. In all my time playing warband and chivalry I've never had a more intense melee in chivalry. In warband you need to account for distance, footwork swing direction, and feinting.  Chivalry just isn't as skill intensive."
mountandblade,3b2m5o,CRANIEL,0,Fri Jun 26 00:06:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly: do it better.  It's kind of like playing Counter Strike.  People have figured out the optimal way to kill people, and do it quite fast.  There is no real counter apart from doing it better.  In the real world such tactics wouldn't work at all (swords be heavy yo)... But in a world where you can instantly stop an attack and then change to another... yeah.  It's a failing of the combat system really.  Positioning and angle ends up not mattering: whereas pointing the mouse the right way at the right time is almost the entire system.  What it is in dire need of is a stamina cost to attacking."
mountandblade,3b2m5o,SaturdayMorningSwarm,2,Fri Jun 26 08:14:00 2015 UTC,"Positioning and angle are fundamental to the game's combat system. The main issue that OP is having is probably due to these factors; as a new player he won't have any confidence in his ability and will backpedal, resulting in a decreased attack speed, hence the inability to fight the 'spamming'. Pointing the mouse the right way is not the entire system, it is really the most basic level of combat; other factors such as positioning and angle will be built around this as a player improves."

mountandblade,3azdb3,Bookshelfstud,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:17:10 2015 UTC,William Marshal was the real-life inspiration for Sir Lancelot   Huh?  William Marshal was still a young man when Chretien de Troyes was writing.  That's not to say Marshal's exploits couldn't have been the inspiration for later tales about Lancelot.
mountandblade,3azdb3,alfonsoelsabio,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:54:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, William Marshal was 30 or 31 years old when Chretien began Lancelot, Knight of the Cart, and Marshal had already kicked plenty of ass in the name of chivalry by then--nearly all of the ass-kicking done near Chretien's homeland as well. Anyone who knew knights knew who William Marshal was at that time, especially Chretien. Now, of course it's a stretch for me to say he was the only inspiration for Lancelot, but Marshal was the flower of chivalry in his time, and several of his stories align with Lancelot's. And yes, of course some of them were added to the Arthuriad by other authors, as you suggest. No one owns Arthurian legend, and that's what's so great about it!"

Volunteers are basically people who're volunteer for you at such cheap price to hire them until you upgrade them better as they level up by pressing P on map and seeing the party to select your units you have to rank them up which cost more money.  Basically hire a few volunteers, ask for tasks from any of the vassals/lords and kill bandits, makes quite a bit of money. If you merc for a kingdom as some tasks you ask for will ask for you to join as a mercenary for them for a temp time by paying you for it. You can loot and burn villages with good loot to sell of your enemy that your faciton you merced for may be warring against."

Also, just read through some of the recent threads on this sub - there are a lot of newer players due to the recent sales, so others have likely asked questions that you'll find useful to read over."
mountandblade,3b0jr7,Orcrist9000,3,Thu Jun 25 00:13:41 2015 UTC,"My strategy has always just been to capture lords. I'll max out my party and heal up (oftentimes I'm more limited by my character's health than the loss of my troops), then drop into deep enemy territory and lay siege to a town or castle. If I'm lucky I can take it before enemies arrive, but sometimes I'll end up attracting their entire army to me. I prefer to do this when my faction is laying siege somewhere else so I split them up.  When enemies arrive, they often outnumber me. In Geko, 500 to 150 is really about my ability to stay alive personally, not my troops. If I saw more than that, I'd be much more concerned and I'd probably leave after I won the first clash. The problem with this method is that if I leave the battle partway through when my losses get too high, there will be several bands of enemies with 0 soldiers roaming about. That's no good. I deserve to capture those lords.  The best solution for capturing is to drop into enemy territory and take out as many small lords as possible. With 180 troops, I can make most parties run from me, split them up, and conquer them one at a time. Then just rinse and repeat until you have captured some lords. Without those lords, they'll have a hard time waging war on you, raiding your fiefs, sieging your castles, or anything else that annoys you. At that point, winning the war can sometimes be easier than getting them to declare peace, especially if you're not fighting many factions, it's a small faction, or you've fought them before and weakened them. Once I really get into the swing of things, it takes me about two or three good wars to annihilate a faction, without fail.   If you're having problems with too many factions, maybe you could try eliminating one while you're still a vassal. I did that by defeating the Nords on my first Native playthrough and I started my kingdom in their territory. The Native map is hard because you're always within reach of the other factions, for the most part. I'm not familiar with the PoP map, but try starting your kingdom off in a corner that you conquer while you're with Ravenstern. It will be a weak, extended arm of Ravenstern that you can easily sever and take for yourself. And of course, raise your RtR while you're at it."
mountandblade,3b0jr7,Prometheus720,3,Thu Jun 25 07:35:35 2015 UTC,"Capturing lords might be a good one too, yeah, although that wasn't really a viable option in my case as they were contantly gathered in campaign armies and actively laying siege to my fiefs. Not many opportunities to pick off individual ones, and I couldn't do deep raids with my capital under threat.   Another thing in PoP is that there is (I believe) a higher percentage of elite troops in each army when compared to other mods I've played. I can comfortably take on parties equal to my size, but I'll take losses. A party twice my size could probably be beaten but it would significantly reduce my own elite troops at this point, so I'd rather just avoid them.   A good thing about PoP is that massive random spawns can come out of the woodwork real suddenly. One of the sieges against me was broken by a horse-riding faction that is hostile to everybody else. Another time a company of Noldor elves showed up and thrashed some big parties with my help. So I'm mostly piggybacking on more powerful friends in this mod.    try starting your kingdom off in a corner that you conquer while you're with Ravenstern. It will be a weak, extended arm of Ravenstern that you can easily sever and take for yourself. And of course, raise your RtR while you're at it.   That's exactly what I'm doing right now. Although I don't want to make the mistake that nearly killed me in Floris: having made my former faction way too powerful and a pain in the ass to beat later on.   I'm trying to expand while also sort of maintaining the balance of power between the other nations. The Ravenstern are happily eating their way through Fierdsvain territory right now, so I will probably abandon their ship after the next major victory and join my neighbouring Sarleons.   Thanks for your council! Nevertheless, I'm no closer to figuring out what influences the faction's fighting spirit on a strategic level, and in what measure.   I think most (if not all) of the AI decisions are essentially a regular mathematical test:adding and subtracting various factors, the outcome of which will decide the course of action. And I wonder how looting factors into that."
mountandblade,3b0jr7,Shmoox000,3,Thu Jun 25 10:16:04 2015 UTC,"In PoP, I always found the best places to start your own kingdom was close to the Noldor area. That way anyone who tries to invade your area has to deal with not only you but all the random noldor parties traveling around. Just make sure your at least neutral with them otherwise I'd choose a different starting location.  As far as villages goes, I've only really noticed anything changing after I've captured castles/cities. When I'm strong enough I normally try to run down as many lord parties as I could since each lord captured is one less army on the field. If possible go after the current Marshal since that will really hamper their ability to siege anything."

My King and his vassals have gone into hiding, but I alone stalk the earth. Hardened knights and mercenaries march under my banner for their pay, but the knights seek vengeace, their homes long since looted and burned. I can see Veluca from my tent. The men on the walls grip their crossbows as we prepare the siege tower, and swords are sharped, bows strung, and shield straps tightened.

mountandblade,3ay2cb,Nelec,7,Thu Jun 25 07:37:31 2015 UTC,"Brace for wall of text, these techniques have won me Calradia.   I've invested a decent amount of time building relations with various jarls, but all for nothing, and I'm not strong enough yet to turn the tide myself.   Building relationships with nobles is always a good investment of time in my opinion. I have a save running where I have conquered almost all of Calradia at the moment, and what I tried to prioritise was instead of swearing allegiance to a faction right away was building a dye works in EVERY major city, apart from those in the Kingdom of the Rhodoks and the Khergit Khanate (Rhodoks I couldn't break even in any cities and Khergit because, well, I just don't like Khergits :p).  What I would recommend is abandoning ship and going at it alone for a while. The advantage of going alone when making money becomes a lot easier, because you aren't limited to the ties your liege has to other factions. For example if you ally early with Swadia, and have dye works in all of the Nordic cities, and they declare war, all of your dyeworks will fall under sequestration, halting your income.   When you renounce, I would prioritise the following;   Winning tournaments to gain renown and cash   You can get around 3890 from betting 100 denars on yourself each on each round of a tournament. That's if you win of course, by the time you have done a few you will get the hang of them and it will be almost impossible for you to lose.   Trading   The majority of the money I made early on in the game was simply buy buying high and selling low, I improved my trading skill so I was able to see the best prices, and allowed me to maximise profits. What I would do was simply go to any city, assess the local prices, and buy everything that could get me a profit of at least 50 - 60 denars +, then travel to that city and rinse repeat. I even used a notebook to keep track of where I was selling each of my goods and for how much. It is absurd how much money you can make from doing this.   Slave trade   In the early game, I hired some manhunters and upgraded them as time went on. They are extremely useful, because instead of killing, they knock out, meaning you can sell the victims as slaves to ransom brokers. I also made sure I was equipped with a mace myself.   Basically, take your time. You haven't really lost anything. Use the above methods to create dye works all over the map. Furthermore, another thing I would recommend is to build relations to AT LEAST 30 with the faction you want to defect to in the future, once you are rolling in cash. This means that we will grant you a SHIT LOAD of fiefs, seriously he will be dishing out castles to you left right and centre. Even as a female character, when I joined a faction I was granted 3 castles and 2 villages in the first month of my vassalage.  If you have any questions feel free to ask.  edit: buying high and selling low isn't the best of ideas."

mountandblade,3ay2cb,Nelec,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:27:54 2015 UTC,"Joining lords in battle against bandits/raiders will increase the relation of whatever faction that lord belongs to. You don't necessarily need to aid them in battle against lords of opposing factions, however if a faction has an opinion of you of -10 (by actions such as raiding caravans) you will be able to aid someone in combat no matter what faction they are because the faction of the lord they are fighting is hostile to you anyway.  If you are already hostile with the faction you want to improve relations with, as in their lords attack you on sight even though you aren't the member of a faction they are at war with (-10 relation). You can do missions for the guild masters of fiefs which the hostile lords own."
mountandblade,3ay2cb,cantstoplurking,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:25:30 2015 UTC,"An effective method of gaining relationships with lords, quickly, cheaply, and easily, I find, is through freeing imprisoned lords. It is easiest to exploit a war in which you play no hand - you can free the lords of both sides, and you will be able to use all of your equipment, as there is no need to sneak into the castles of kingdoms which you are in good standing with. You will gain about seven relationship points with each lord that you free. If you are worried about your ability to defeat the guards - and believe me, with good equipment, you shouldn't be - there is also the option of lighting a fire in a nearby village to decrease the amount of guards.  If you do fail, do not worry - while you will lose a bit of cash, your inventory will remain untouched and soon you will be able to walk free, with all of your army. It is a low-risk opportunity, unless you have time-sensitive affairs at the time you begin a prison break.  Upon finding an imprisoned lord, it is worthwhile to seek out his relatives. They will almost certainly request that you free their relative, and you will gain a some relation with he who gave you the quest, as well as a fair bit of experience and money."
mountandblade,3ay2cb,Prometheus720,3,Sat Jun 27 02:16:27 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that you should leave and strike out on your own for a bit. Go rack up some dough and experience.   Mamlukes and Manhunter units are great for slaving. It's a quick way to make money. Go kill some Sea Raiders and you can sell their gear for good money too. And go to tournaments, like others said. Money is not something you want to worry about when you start your kingdom. You want massive reserves. Let me give you a list of shit to do before you shack up somewhere again.   Enterprises. Use your money to make more money. 10k for a dyeworks will pay off in 20 weeks at 500/week. You may get more money than that. Don't feel like you always have to do dyeworks, either. Sometimes you make more money in absolute terms with other enterprises, and sometimes you just get your money back faster with other enterprises. Remember that it's not just about making your money back. It's about adding a base income that you can rely on week-to-week to keep your troops upgraded and marching along. Enterprises=troop capacity. Books. Buy all the ones you need. Some of them only offer party skills, so don't waste your money on them. Be wise about how you use them. If your build is able to go up to 21 INT, don't use a book on wound treatment until you hit 21 INT and have 7 wound treatment. Otherwise you'll waste three points of int. Gear.  You don't need to get the very best if you're only like 1-2 points away and it costs like 100k gold. Forget that shit. Get good gear for your companions too. It's worth it, I swear. Money in the bank. You shouldn't have to worry about buying a few fief improvements for your first fiefs. 100k is plenty, but you could certainly still do ok with less. 70k is good. XP. You will need a damn good engineer when you start your kingdom. Level 7 or above is pretty much a requirement, especially for siege towers. Level 10 is worth it, if you can have an INT-based party skill slave. Medic skills and path-finding are also highly-valued. Go to bandit hideouts to help train your companions. You can gain some renown (and save time/money) by taking smaller parties on slaving trips. Renown=troop capacity, so try to get as much as you can. It's not really easy to get from killing bandits and things, but that's ok. You'll get more later.   When you have those things (renown excepted), you can join or create a faction. When you're in a faction, your initial job is to gain renown ASAP. You need to get strong enough to fight real fights. Don't bother with small lords or taking this or that empty castle. Fight battles of attrition.   Then, when you are strong on your own, you can start to take out their field militaries. Remove the fangs and all wolves are puppies. Then you can take castles and towns, and while you're at it, send out emissaries to gain RtR. Do that day and night, and send out multiple emissaries when you are at peace."

mountandblade,3azur7,ProfessionalWingman,-8,Wed Jun 24 23:54:22 2015 UTC,came here to say this
mountandblade,3azur7,Relexrahl,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:57:53 2015 UTC,Dear diary...... Jackpot.
mountandblade,3b0lxr,DrCaesars_Palace_MD,9,Thu Jun 25 00:32:53 2015 UTC,"Many of the contenders are the lords of Calradia or city guards or sellswords. Of course, an experienced combatant will be able to outmatch a lowly peasant or lord like yourself. To be able to wipe your boot with their banners, you'll need to become more experienced than them or use your wit to the advantage.  Using the interface, a few things you can do that might make it easier are:   Selecting which weapons/armor you start with. Choosing how large your team is. Picking what field you play on. What is allowed in the tournament (you could ban bows if they're a problem). Decide what team you play on. Determine much the payout is (using bets & wagers). Choose who fights in the tournament (companions).   Spend some time tinkering with the options to make tournaments perform how you want. If you want absolute control, you could make your choice effect tournaments at every city around Calradia or you can make individual presets for each arena.  If you want, you can always disable everything and return to Native tournaments with better AI.    Remember, you can use commands while in a tournament to order your team around. You can order them to follow behind so everyone attacks together instead of scurrying off around the map, or you can have them hold position where it is advantageous.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask."
mountandblade,3b0lxr,TrotsTwats,4,Thu Jun 25 00:48:04 2015 UTC,"Believe me, I've tinkered quite a lot. Though that last bit you added might be very helpful, and I'm very thankful you told me that! I can use that to my advantage, as I've only been able to win one v one matches in a crossbow duel atm.   There's one thing that has me completely confused about the options for the tournaments however, which is the bidding. I had it figured I can bid certain amounts of money on how many points I can win, however, regardless of the points I bet on winning, it never actually matters, saying I bet to win completely different numbers of points. Can you explain it to me?"
mountandblade,3b0lxr,TrotsTwats,5,Thu Jun 25 01:39:37 2015 UTC,"Betting works quite differently than in Native. The wager amount is how much you bet that you can beat your bid points.   In Native, the system in place is an all-or-nothing system; if you don't win a round, you lose your money. In Floris you instead bid on how well you will perform, not if you'll win the round. I like this system a lot better because it's more about your own performance than 'Only one guy to g- I just got killed by an arrow.'  You get 1 point for defeating an enemy, and 2 points for surviving a round. All you have to do is score equal or greater than that number to win your payout.   The betting is persistent over all the rounds and done automatically; you set it at the beginning and don't worry until the end.  The payout is based on how much you wager, the difficulty of your bid, and the difficulty of the opponents you're fighting against."
mountandblade,3b0lxr,TrotsTwats,3,Thu Jun 25 02:13:57 2015 UTC,"I see, thank you. I'm still getting slaughtered though xD I'm doing better in the rounds, but it's about 50/50 that my team still doesn't immediately get killed about 2 seconds after contacting the enemy melee fighters?   I'm also having major problems fighting anyone alone. I can't really fight anyone unless they're stunned, so I try to shield bash them. My shield clips through them, very visibly going through them, as their weapon takes about 50% of my health out.   There's just nothing I can do if they're close to me. If I have to  fight someone up close, I'm going to die, no matter what. I cant hit them because they block, I can't wait for an opening because they always still hit first. I can't stun them because hit detection is non-existent half the time when I shield bash. I'm at a loss of how to win a tournament anymore."
mountandblade,3b0lxr,TrotsTwats,2,Thu Jun 25 02:34:10 2015 UTC,"I never found shield bashing useful, in that situation it'll come down to pure skill and a few flakes of luck.  Remember you can kick by pressing E, this allows you to stun the opponent and take the offensive. Be mindful that if you miss, you'll be left exposed and probably suffer an untimely slash or bludgeon.   Perhaps try a different weapon or use the terrain to your advantage. If you walk with a wall on your left, their slashes will harmlessly clang against the wall. You can use this slight delay to counter with your own swing.  As for your team dying so quickly, I don't see why this would be the case. Maybe turn down the damage your allies recieve or select a different team to spawn as. You could just be ending up with terrible allies against experienced vetrans.  When all else fails, get a horse and run into them a whole lot :P"
mountandblade,3b0lxr,EFlagS,2,Thu Jun 25 02:44:42 2015 UTC,I'll try what I can xD
mountandblade,3b0lxr,Prometheus720,2,Thu Jun 25 03:11:39 2015 UTC,"Bah. Is there another alternative early game way to get money? This isn't gonna work. Even if I get first place, I can barely get 1000 gold if I'm lucky. I can't do anywhere near as much damage as I take, so tournaments are just a waste of time. I might just go back to normal Warband, this isn't even remotely fun, grinding money through tournaments I can't even have fun in."
mountandblade,3b0lxr,DUDE_R_T_F_M,6,Thu Jun 25 04:47:43 2015 UTC,Start businesses Buy land Buy a boat Trade Sell slaves Be a mercenary Compete in the arena Do quests Help manhunters Join the army   ...There is a lot to do in Floris.
mountandblade,3b0lxr,Windyplains,2,Thu Jun 25 11:57:21 2015 UTC,"On what difficulty are you doing the tournaments? You get a lot more if don't do them on easy or normal. Also the prizes are better. Obviously it gets a lot harder so it's a trade off. To me it made a lot more sense than native, which you could exploit more. Felt a little unfair. Also you get some wicked item rewards if you do we on harder difficulties.   By the way if after everything it's still not your cup of tea you don't have to go to native. You can disable this tournament system altogether in the mod options: you can disable most of what it offers actually. That the point of Floris I think. It's Native+."
mountandblade,3b0lxr,EFlagS,0,Thu Jun 25 06:15:11 2015 UTC,"Tournaments should be hard. They are insanely hard in ACOK early game because of gear differences, which is actually a nice feature. Lords SHOULD be beefy as fuck. You're fighting the best people in the realm!  Just suck it up and fight some bandits like you're supposed to instead of going for easy money. I never bothered with Floris (I will someday) but in Native I always just went and found a band of like 6 Sea raiders and trashed them with like 10 villagers for their gear. Rinse and repeat till you have decent gear for your companions too."
mountandblade,3aywp1,JasonMoth,12,Wed Jun 24 16:46:06 2015 UTC,"MOTHERFUCKING COUNT CLAIS AND HIS ENITRE BLOODLINE  I swear, I was trying to make my mark in Swadia, so I was asking around for tasks. I go up to Clais, he tells me that his son, Devlian, has been captured by the Khergits. So I rally my fifty or so men and we head out to Temerra Castle, deep within Khanate territory.   As soon as I arrive near the castle I am ambushed by a force of over a hundred Khergit skirmishers, I flee, leaving me with around thirty men. As i wait to regain health and attempt to free Count Devlian, he is released from captivity and his father, COUNT CLAIS, is indicted by Harlaus and he flees to guess who  I'll let you guess  Done?  YUP THE FUCKING KHANATE  His son later defected along with his brother Deglan to I believe the Nords and Rhodoks  So in conclusion Fuck Clais, Fuck Devlian, and Fuck the Khanate"
mountandblade,3aywp1,Chimerical_Shard,8,Wed Jun 24 19:58:12 2015 UTC,I... I'm friends with Count Clais.
mountandblade,3aywp1,ProfessionalWingman,2,Wed Jun 24 21:46:04 2015 UTC,They sound like a family of pricks
mountandblade,3aywp1,EricandtheLegion,11,Thu Jun 25 20:22:07 2015 UTC,I hate Count Mirchaud. Fuck that guy. I am also very untrusting of Boyar Crahask after he jumped from faction to faction about 5 times.
mountandblade,3aywp1,EricandtheLegion,18,Wed Jun 24 16:49:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Crahask is pure scum. I mean, just listen to that name. Cruh-HASK. The stench of treason and cowardice is overwhelming.  He even tried to woo my fair maiden Aesa, and then had the gall to claim that I was the one usurping her affections. Needless to say, Aesa and I are now married and Crahask is rotting away in my prison at Tihr, where he will spend the rest of his days reflecting on the craven errors that caused his fall."
mountandblade,3aywp1,Super_Jay,11,Wed Jun 24 17:17:08 2015 UTC,This story warms my heart.
mountandblade,3aywp1,EricandtheLegion,6,Wed Jun 24 18:02:00 2015 UTC,"I know, right? It's really the touching moments like these that make Warband such a delightful, uplifting experience."
mountandblade,3aywp1,Super_Jay,3,Thu Jun 25 03:36:57 2015 UTC,"I have developed a good relationship with Mirchaud on my current save. One time, he set out to lead a military campaign, and, despite multiple reports of groups of enemies, he would just run around and not pursue anyone.  82/82 would run around with Count Mirchaud again."
mountandblade,3aywp1,Abnorc,2,Thu Jun 25 19:48:01 2015 UTC,I wish death upon you and your kingdom

mountandblade,3aywp1,ResoIve,8,Wed Jun 24 16:50:06 2015 UTC,"King Graveth... Man, what a dickhead. I obliterated his armies ten times over, smacked the shit out of his kingdom along with the Sarranids and Swadians, and still, he want to ""push the war a little longer for honor"", even though he lost everything."
mountandblade,3aywp1,Kalandros-X,11,Wed Jun 24 20:49:45 2015 UTC,"King Graveth is stupidly courageous. He doesn't back down no matter how bad he's losing. He's the only king who i believe is more rightful to rule than his pretender, and he's kind and honorable to his vassals, sharing land almost equally amongst them. I love Graveth, and the only reason i declared independence from him was i controlled 4 cities and i thought i could fight the swadians better on my own.  He wasnt even pissed when i broke off and took a bunch of rhodok land. I lost no relation points and he offered peace within a week"
mountandblade,3aywp1,Bnlol1,12,Wed Jun 24 23:06:37 2015 UTC,TIL that Graveth is actually an alright dude and that I've been kicking his ass mercilessly for no good reason.   Are... are we the baddies?

mountandblade,3aywp1,SKNZ_,5,Mon Jul 6 02:43:35 2015 UTC,"I've always liked Graveth, he's never fucked me over and when I was his vassal always treated me well. He was also the first king I got to like me, so when he greeted me he was always so nice."
mountandblade,3aywp1,Striding_Huntsman,8,Thu Jun 25 05:05:24 2015 UTC,"King Harlaus. Scummy butter-sucker, terrible at everything he does, and can only be useful once plied with gifts and butter."
mountandblade,3aywp1,vinniejay,7,Thu Jun 25 00:32:58 2015 UTC,My first game I started off as a loyal subject of King Harlaus.   Never again.
mountandblade,3aywp1,Cookie_Eater108,2,Thu Jun 25 12:43:43 2015 UTC,I always butter up to Harlaus in the beginning and then I start to convince swadian lords to follow me and I rebel against him.
mountandblade,3aywp1,Bravefart99,7,Mon Jun 29 17:11:44 2015 UTC,"Count Haringoth. He looks as cruel and dishonourable as he really is. In all my Rhodok games, all he does is raid and pillage villages with his 100+ army, because he starts with so much renown, instead of supporting his army. He's usually my first actual ""rival"" and the only person I would never set free. He has caught me off guard too many times, trampled over my unconscious body with his cavalry swarm, single-handedly stolen castles and cities and just keeps that haughty better than you attitude every time we meet.   AND EVEN WORSE. His fief, Castle Haringoth, HAS RHODOK ARCHITECTURE. I don't even understand how. Rhodoks get shafted with castles on the north-west side, but Haringoth? His castle's hall is the same size as Jelkala. And its a bastard to siege.   Just... fuck you. Fuck you Haringoth."
mountandblade,3aywp1,yngir,2,Thu Jun 25 13:26:08 2015 UTC,No mattet what he is always so arrogant. Always switching sides so he can keep his stupid named castle. Bastard

mountandblade,3aywp1,wikatca,2,Wed Jun 24 16:52:49 2015 UTC,YES. I captured him and let him rot in my castle forever because I hate him so much. Always tried to loot and pillage my fief whenever I wasn't there.
mountandblade,3aywp1,BlazingLlama254,5,Fri Jun 26 11:44:32 2015 UTC,"Montewar in Native, motherfucking Daven Lannister in ACOK, and the lord with the unspellable name who has more gunners to back up his main infantry force than I have troops all together in Gekokujo.   Especially Daven Lannister. Fuck you Daven."
mountandblade,3aywp1,MalaysianFlightPlann,5,Thu Jun 25 03:58:56 2015 UTC,"Ulusamai Noyan. I call him Salami.  My first fief was Tebandra just south of Reyvadin. That motherfucker consistently came up to raid my village. And some of his friends, as well.  Finally, once I had taken over the whole map, that motherfucker was roaming around by himself raiding my villages BY HIMSELF. Him and Sanjar Khan. And of course you can't really catch a guy who's by himself with a big warband, but you're high level now and bandit parties are like 50 strong.  Fuck that guy."
mountandblade,3aywp1,Prometheus720,2,Thu Jun 25 08:15:21 2015 UTC,I'm happy to see I'm not the only one to call him Salami.

mountandblade,3aywp1,I_worship_odin,3,Fri Jun 26 04:19:42 2015 UTC,All the noble lords are incompetent babies unable to be trusted. I always like to form a smaller kingdom with companions of mine and raid and pillage the surrounding kingdoms.
mountandblade,3aywp1,Castle_Walls,3,Wed Jun 24 22:42:00 2015 UTC,"Goddamn Jarl Olaf. Bastard always ends up hating me, regardless of what I do. Not to mention his army has destroyed my army at least twice I can remember, usually after I've been weakened fighting a larger foe."
mountandblade,3aywp1,Striding_Huntsman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:03:34 2015 UTC,He is a beast on the battlefield though. I saw his party game Castela by itself.
mountandblade,3aywp1,Lucifer_Hirsch,2,Wed Jul 1 06:01:54 2015 UTC,Count Mathied. He was the Rhodok marshal and I was a Rhodok merc. He would always send me on bs scouting/bandit hunting missions when all the counts went and took cities and crushed armies.
mountandblade,3aywp1,NativeNazi,2,Fri Jun 26 02:19:59 2015 UTC,"Count Regas... he's plundered my village about 10 times on my current save. I never capture people to make sure my honour is really high, but he's the one exception."

He goes out of his way to raid my single village. My village is next to fucking Tulga, and he works for the Vaegirs. He will literally pass through miles of Khergit territory just to fuck me over.   One day my character will get a castle. Then she will keep him in prison till even the sun forgets his name."
mountandblade,3aywp1,lee61,2,Sat Jun 27 01:31:51 2015 UTC,I'm glad I'm not the only one who hates Despin's guts.  That fucker is rotting in my dungeon now with 3 other swadia counts
mountandblade,3azl6f,AegonITargaryen,2,Wed Jun 24 19:46:59 2015 UTC,"I can recommend it, yes. It offers a ton of new stuff, quests and is one of the most challenging mods around."
mountandblade,3azl6f,jimmyw404,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:53:55 2015 UTC,Thanks alot! I will surely try it out but I'd like to hear more feedback to the mod. I've already heard that it'S probably the most challenging mod which I really look forward to!
mountandblade,3azl6f,jimmyw404,2,Wed Jun 24 19:57:55 2015 UTC,"The mod also has a lot of flavor in that it has unique armies that spawn with very different unit types and have a lot of different behaviors.   The knight orders offer a very long and deep upgrade path. In vanilla M&B your upgrade path is to basically get Swadian Knights. In PoP, you accrue a renown/honor like resource you can spend to 'knight' noblemen which turns them into the elite troops here:  http://pop3.wikia.com/wiki/Knighthood_Orders  You can then upgrade that order, found your own, set custom equipment etc. Because of the huge level range in PoP, a swadian knight is basically a midtier unit."
mountandblade,3azl6f,tickletaylor,2,Wed Jun 24 21:16:19 2015 UTC,"YES. with all my heart, its the most finished and deep mod. It doesn't have unnecessary features. it just feels polished. yes it is challenging, but in a well what did i expect kind of challenging. Powerful units are hard to kill at first, so expect a decent amount of bottom feeding to work your way up, but its worth it. Factions are interesting, the law has had a good amount of effort put into it, There are plenty of secrets scattered around. Just give it a go, and dont fast travel unless you want to get wrecked, also i found pathfinding is a must. Also knighthood orders are awesome"
mountandblade,3azl6f,Orcrist9000,2,Wed Jun 24 23:49:58 2015 UTC,"I've been playing it for a bit now and I really like it. It has been a humbling experience, I must say. I feel that as an indiviual fighter, my presence on the battlefield is a lot weaker than in the base game. I've been gaining some levels and am on a even footing with most of the powerful units now stat-wise, but I am still much more reliant on my troops than I ever was in other mods.   I remember playing a LOTR-mod called The Last Days, and I could just cut through 60 orcs on my own like some sort of lawnmower. PoP doesn't work like that to say the least. Battles are dangerous, chaotic, full of little duels with foes whose stats are comparable to your own if not better... it's a much more tooth-and-nail combat experience than I've been used to in MnB.   Maybe that will all change when I reach late-game, but then there are still lots of features I haven't even touched upon so far. Things like Knighthood orders, contacts with the Noldor elves, and so on.   I'd say you should have a go at it, but be prepared to re-examine your usual strategies, and fear and respect your foes, especially in the beginning. There are knights out there that really don't care about the fact that you're still learing the ropes of Pendor."
mountandblade,3azl6f,elsteve0,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:32:49 2015 UTC,I really enjoy it. There are a lot of Minor factions to avoid or engage customer gear and magical items.  There is always a lot going on on the map.  For example in my game one of the main factions has lost a city to a Barbarian horde who have come down out of the Mountains.  Its is a challenge but in the best possible way.

mountandblade,3azq03,Raven_Ashareth,3,Wed Jun 24 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"You'll be fine, just keep in mind you won't have a balanced army for the most part. Simply remember what your faction units' strengths and weaknesses are and fight accordingly. Nords and Rhodok are slow moving, Vaegir have no shields, Khergit suck at melee, Sarrinid have poor infantry, and everyone hates King Harlaus."
mountandblade,3azq03,someproteinguy,4,Wed Jun 24 21:56:15 2015 UTC,"I always just use one faction's troops, it's not hard by any means (depending on who you fight and what difficulty you play on)."
mountandblade,3azq03,TrotsTwats,6,Wed Jun 24 20:28:30 2015 UTC,"I suppose a real curiosity. I feel like the Huscarls could weather the storm of arrows Rhodoks could bring to bear, could stand the charge of a Khergit horse horde, could stand man to man against the Vaegirs, but my concern is the dreaded cavalry charges of Swadian knights."
mountandblade,3azq03,TrotsTwats,4,Wed Jun 24 20:33:25 2015 UTC,"Form your men into ranks. The cavalry will get caught in the wall and can easily be taken out by your other men. If you have archers, they'll have an easy time picking the cavalry off while their horses are pressed against the shields.  It also helps to put your men on a hillside or behind trees, that way the cavalry have to slow down before making contact."

mountandblade,3azq03,Orcrist9000,2,Thu Jun 25 06:42:53 2015 UTC,"The 50/50 Nord Huscarl Archer split was what I did for one of my earliest playthroughs, and it wrecks face. Just hold position, send the infantry a bit forwards, and tell the infantry to stand closer a couple of times. You can also set companions with spears just a hair in front of the infantry to take the brunt of the cavalry charge. Glue for days. Let the archers rip their infantry apart as they advance, then charge your huscarls in to finish their archers. The only problems I've found is with horse archers and routing enemies, but you can disable routing with tweakmb.  Sure, the archers aren't the best, but they are unbelievably cheap and quick to level up. They're good light infantry when they run out of arrows. And huscarls are huscarls. But without a cavalry force to distract the enemy, they'll be taking a lot of damage, so expect to lose huscarls about as fast as you can raise them.  edit: oh, and you want to charge the Rhodoks right away, or ""goodbye shields! Goodbye army!"""
mountandblade,3axlyq,InsufferableCush,16,Wed Jun 24 09:01:39 2015 UTC,"Are you carrying too much cargo? If you have too much cargo (food, or trade goods such as wool or iron) your speed on the world map will slow to a crawl.   To combat this, keep some spare horses in your inventory. Horses in your inventory reduce the speed penalty from carrying cargo. 1-2 horses are fine in the early game (more if you're playing as a trader) while by mid game I generally have about 5-6, which is all you'll ever need. The quality/type of the horse, and whether or not it is lame, does not matter when carrying cargo."
mountandblade,3axlyq,SylonL,10,Wed Jun 24 12:39:21 2015 UTC,I have a couple hundred hours in this game and I never knew that. That's super cool and immersive.

mountandblade,3axe1g,kookomagoo,3,Wed Jun 24 12:08:22 2015 UTC,"Nice work! If possible, you want to offload King Ragnar onto another lord, so they can imprison him. (Until you control a castle or city, you won't have a prison yourself.)  Go around to them and ask if they have any tasks for you, and hopefully one of them will pay you to take Ragnar off your hands. Otherwise, he'll likely escape from your party eventually."

mountandblade,3axe1g,yngir,2,Wed Jun 24 15:17:10 2015 UTC,"You can take a chance and hold onto him for a ransom. I've ransomed a him for about 20,000 before - which near the start of the game, pays for your dyeworks and you need not worry about income for a long time.   Its risky though, as Super_Jay says, he could escape and that's lose lose as he'll start raising an army again."
mountandblade,3axe1g,yngir,3,Thu Jun 25 13:16:06 2015 UTC,"Ended up getting an offer for about 10000 on him from the Nords and went with it. Not as much as I was hoping for, but hey, it's another dye works. I've got a fairly good army set up now though and have been able to pick off and sell the jarls fairly regularly if I'm careful to get them alone.  One question, I got my first fief and saw that it has a prison but I can't seem to find anyone to talk to me at my castle about prisoners or barracks or anything. Where is that option at?"

mountandblade,3axblv,jimmyw404,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:51:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know why all of them go to the same faction. Maybe if a friend or relative of them has already joined that faction, there's a bigger chance they will go there too?   Even so as you say, there's not enough fiefs to go around for all of them. If the 1257AD ai is anything like Vanilla's, lots of lords are bound to get negative relations with the leader of that faction because of that. So at some point, the majority will start defecting, possibly filling up another faction.   I'd say try to avoid war with that faction and hope they will attack somewhere else and wait it out till they start to crumble."
mountandblade,3axblv,Orcrist9000,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:17:22 2015 UTC,yeah unfortunately there's nowhere else for them to go and in the meantime they're just gobbling up all our territory. so basically this game is over for me haha.
mountandblade,3axblv,Orcrist9000,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:40:59 2015 UTC,"Them getting fiefs will surely slow down the defection progress I'm afraid. As a last ditch effort, you could try figuring out which of their lords have low relations with the king and try to talk them into joining you. It will likely be landless lords with small retinues, so you can talk to them without them ganging up on you (unless they're campaiging). If they have doubts about their own faction but still don't want to join you, defeat them, hope to be able to capture them, then let them go. The difference between their relation to you and their relation to their king will alter in your favor (or that's how it works in Vanilla I believe).   If that does not work, just prepare to be devoured. Could make for an epic last stand scene :)"
mountandblade,3axblv,Mephistopholees,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:40:11 2015 UTC,"That's the Teutonic Order for me. There is always one, I suppose. If I had a large faction of my own and sufficient time to prepare I could beat them, except the fucking Religious shit always fucks me over. Like, fight Muslims trying to besiege Rome? You fought on Papal territory, so you are going to let us raid your kingdom with impunity and if you resist the entire Catholic world will divert all time and resources against you. HRE declares war against you? Fuck it, why not the Order too? They are only on the other coast of Europe, tied up in another war, but they have 20 lords that will never show up for campaign anyhow so they'll just raid the shit out of everything you own.

Tocan's Calradia and Scaedumar feel very similar (both has those gameplay-enhancing features from Diplomacy and Prebattle Order and gameplay addition features such as naval battle, seafaring, stronger bandits/bandit heroes) but in the end I pick Scaedumar because it doesn't meddle at all with the faction. Tocan's Calradia changes the faction a bit (changes people's and kingdom's names, change Halraus to a queen); if you can live with it I'd recommend Tocan's Calradia as feature-wise it's more interesting."

Then once the Mystmountain army spawns, go to around Poinsbruk to get that Strange Rune Bow gift, and make sure you have 7 power draw by then. Unless you're min-maxing with all-int."
mountandblade,3awus6,Cdmbr,2,Wed Jun 24 05:13:09 2015 UTC,"I would wait until later game to level an archer. POP's early game is not friendly to low-skilled archers, but you can always be useful with  a lance.   Otherwise, early game for me is putting together an all merc cavalry band. You're still quick enough to outrun the scary enemies, but you can take on the regular bandits and red slavers(?). PoP doesn't have enough blunt weapons for me to focus on capturing prisoners, so most of my other early game is taken up with trading Fiersdvain goods to Sarleon and Ravenstern, hitting small merc bands, and joining lords in one-sided battles to get in on the looting. PoP gear is worth way more than what it costs to reset your faction relations from -4 or -8, so that last one is particularly useful. Also tag along with and help the Noldor a bit at this stage, for relations an loot."
mountandblade,3awus6,-Arkennon,2,Wed Jun 24 08:13:53 2015 UTC,"You can't. To raise an archer you need good shieldwalls. To get good shieldwalls you need Fierdvains. When you get Fierdvains, you'll quickly find that you don't need archers. Therefore, you will never get archers."

Get your companions, get them horses, level / get gold off easy bandits.  I find that in the early game, using non-companions in your army just drains your gold/xp. And if you get to the mid/late game without a companion core of your army, it's much more expensive because you don't have the companions to take beatings."

mountandblade,3avju2,Homozygote,2,Tue Jun 23 21:08:58 2015 UTC,"Have played both.   Brytenwalda terrain feels like you're playing in the mountains of Afghanistan. Repolished terrain looks like something you might actually find in Britain. Repolished makes cavalry a dozen times more valuable by this alone. If you like being a cavalry general, Repolished is your game.   Brytenwalda unit costs are hellaciously expensive for heavy armor, dirt cheap for peasants in shirts, and prohibitively expensive for any unit on a horse. Repolished upkeep and upgrade costs are a fraction of Brytenwalda's, making it almost too easy imo. One year into Brytenwalda my comitatus was 40 heavy cavalry, 40 longbowmen, maybe 20-25 elite infantry, 150 heavy infantry, and 100 randomly assorted medium-light infantry. Every death mattered to me because upgrading one light horseman to elite cavalry cost 2000 pennings. One year into Repolished, I was shoobadoobaing around England with 650 elite heavy infantry and castles were surrendering without a fight because they were terrified of me."

mountandblade,3auf15,Raven_Ashareth,15,Tue Jun 23 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"PoP is my favorite mod for Warband. And for good reason. I think i have spent around 800 hours in PoP, around 25 or so in Perisno. For me something just clicked with pendor that didnt with perisno. For one it is the aesthetics (is that how you spell it idk) in pendor just seem to match so much more than what they do in perisno. I guess i would call Perisno's artstyle to be too ""grand"" whereas i prefer pendors (mostly) more solid look.  I am also in love with pendors lategame with building a knighthood order and such, or even just joining one itself. I havent reached proper lategame in Perisno so i cannot properly compare that. The lore of pendor is also something that i appreciate more. And i think that pendors difficulty varies a lot from Perisno's. Pendors seems more focused on individuals, plenty of times there have been fights where i have ended upp face to face versus a knight or so and it felt like i was outmatched, i knew who my enemy was and i was not invincible. This is also true for Perisno. But in Perisno it felt like it was the army in general that was the issue. Not the individuals in it.   Pendor also has the feel of urgency, for me at least since if you dont get strong bandits/heretics/cultists/jatu are going to run rampant over all of the lands making things very difficult for you. The music in pendor is also just bloody brilliant, it is the only mod that i play with in game music on since it is just that good. I cannot recall if Perisno has custom music but if it does im sure that is also fantastic.  To conclude, i feel that pendor is the better mod. And i feel that while both of them are similar they also have a lot of things seperating the two, pendor felt more ""finished"" in a way. And it also felt like it stood on something solid. Whereas the foundation for perisno just felt a bit weak in comparison. Sorry for the wall of text, but PoP ftw."
mountandblade,3auf15,Microwavescope,7,Tue Jun 23 17:46:34 2015 UTC,"I sunk 50+ hours into PoP and can confirm, I fought for ravenstern and loved it. The lore. The enemies. The music. Everything is amazing. Best mod for warband by far."
mountandblade,3auf15,williegumdrops,7,Tue Jun 23 18:32:25 2015 UTC,Persino doesn't feel finished because it isn't. It's in 0.75 iirc
mountandblade,3auf15,Avagantamos101,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:21:07 2015 UTC,Well that shows how much i actually know about perisno.
mountandblade,3auf15,Microwavescope,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:05:05 2015 UTC,Been playing a lot of Pendor lately and have to chime on this music thing. It really is that good. I think it's the first time in a videogame where I felt the music had a noticeable impact in me besides homeworld and halo. Even the minor factions have their own music and fighting them with that music really makes the battles feel grand and epic.   I think I'm going to look around for the playlist now.
mountandblade,3auf15,EFlagS,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:41:34 2015 UTC,I think this is all of it. I have listened to that so many times already.
mountandblade,3auf15,Microwavescope,7,Wed Jun 24 12:45:04 2015 UTC,"PoP. Its basically a finished product and is relatively well balanced where as perisno is still pretty rough around the edges, lot of bugs and problems with textures.   The biggest reason for me picking PoP though is the fact that it has working troop formations which makes battles much much better. As far as I know troop formations still dont work in perisno which means its a boring charge fest and basically whoever has the most heavy cavalry wins. I just stacked those falcon guys with maces and beat everything and became rich at the same time."
mountandblade,3auf15,blanetrain,2,Tue Jun 23 19:30:15 2015 UTC,Formations do work in Perisno last I played. yesterday
mountandblade,3auf15,LuckyNights,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:43:32 2015 UTC,Have they been worked back in again? I haven't played since 0.73 and they weren't working then.
mountandblade,3auf15,blanetrain,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:33:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't explored much since I switched to cav style gameplay but I remember seeing stuff like ""form up # rows/ranks"" in the F commands"
mountandblade,3auf15,LuckyNights,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:14:01 2015 UTC,"Im talking about infantry shield walls, archer lines, cavalry forming into a ""V"" etc which used to work in earlier versions and the ai used to use them giving battles a bit more depth but the developers of the mod disabled them in the newer versions. I even messaged the mods and they confirmed that those were no longer working features in game and wouldn't be until they could got more developers on their team.  I even read through the recent versions patch notes and see no note of them being reintroduced which is a shame because for me personally it ruins the entire thing since its boring as hell just mashing two armies together."
mountandblade,3auf15,blanetrain,10,Wed Jun 24 20:26:27 2015 UTC,"I've only spent about 8 hours on PoP, and it's decent I mean there is nothing too special about it. But Perisno is just so much fun to play, now obviously this is just my opinion, but I would consider Perisno to be everything Vanilla should have been and with he touch of fantasy to it. I have played about 20 hours on it and it is so cool with the expansive troop trees and nations and beyond. I personally have Perison down as my favorite mod, so I would pick Perisno any day of the week."
mountandblade,3auf15,TheTrain19,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:05:55 2015 UTC,PoP just felt like too much of a grind for me to really enjoy it. After sinking about 10 hours into it I just quit. The voice acting was a cool concept but I just cringe when I hear a lot of it cause it sounds terrible.  I recently got into Perisno and I have to agree about how awesome the factions and troop trees are in it. The troops all look awesome and it is much less of a grind than PoP. The only issue I have with it is that I think the economy is kind of broken. The price to sell loot to shopkeepers is extremely high and this makes it too easy to spam enterprises all over the world and have more money than you could spend. In my current game I have 5million in my treasury and I'm sitting on another 500k in my inventory just looking for stuff to spend it on.
mountandblade,3auf15,korvoatto,3,Tue Jun 23 19:21:23 2015 UTC,"PoP is finished. But it's a tad grindy, in the beginning at least. Perisno feels a bit imbalanced and it's still a work in progress. I suggest PoP because it's finished, and play Perisno once it's done."
mountandblade,3auf15,Ehtees,3,Tue Jun 23 23:36:20 2015 UTC,"Diehard fan of Pendor here, by far my favorite Warband mod. It adds difficulty, good game progression, and more options of things to do in an interesting world with its own lore, voice acting (some of which is cringeworthy though I admit, but points for doing it at all in a mod), and a great soundtrack.  I could go into a lot more detail but have not the time atm.  Tried Perisno briefly and it was interesting, but had instability issues and horrible framerate at times. It's on my list as something I'm keeping my eye on for future versions when it's polished up a bit, but as it stands I'm going to continue to wait for a more complete version."
mountandblade,3auf15,Paeyvn,2,Wed Jun 24 02:55:04 2015 UTC,"I've only ever played Perisno. The devs are fairly supportive of the Steam Workshop, and the mod itself, while clogged with textures and models bad enough to make Morrowind look modern, is fairly fun.   They really need to cut off the excess fat though, so to speak. So much content that personally, I think doesn't need to be there. If they removed all the low-poly poop and replaced all of it with even half as much high quality content, the game would be stellar, I think."
mountandblade,3auf15,Castle_Walls,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:44:27 2015 UTC,Also does anybody have any opinions on Phantasy Calradia?
mountandblade,3auf15,howloon,2,Tue Jun 23 22:00:43 2015 UTC,"It's a lot of fun, the magic works a lot better than you'd expect, but it's fundamentally unbalanced and having a bunch of mages with fireball spells makes any siege, attacking or defending, completely trivial to win. And some of the magical factions are really brutal to fight."
mountandblade,3auf15,Howler452,2,Wed Jun 24 00:53:21 2015 UTC,"I haven't played a lot of it because the overhead map is insanely laggy for me.  But from what I've seen, it's incredibly easy in late game. Going up against the vanilla game factions with an army of fantasy creatures makes you insanely overpowered. However I heard that the developers are adding in units to the vanilla factions that make them more powerful and able to be on par with the fantasy factions."
mountandblade,3auf15,Howler452,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:25:54 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer Perisno. Prophecy of Pendor has the insane difficulty going for it and while I like that, it seems a bit too difficult, and is incredibly daunting, especially for new players. Perisno on the other hand it has a good balance between being easy enough to get into comfortably, but difficult enough that you're not steamrolling everything.   With that said, PoP is definitely the more stable of the two. It's pretty much finished, but it's also still being updated to my knowledge. Perisno is currently in 0.75 and still has lots of bugs, unfinished quests, placeholders for future updates, and a lot of the textures mess with performance and are unfinished (or completely break, and reach the sky, like the tigers I dealt with in one battle).  Perisno is also incredibly unbalanced in some areas. You will find yourself relying on cavalry a lot in battles (plus the wages for soldiers are insane, investing in prisoner management is a must as it will be a big source of income)  Between the two, I recommend Perisno first, then going into Prophesy of Pendor."
mountandblade,3avspm,A_Confused_Cocoon,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:14:52 2015 UTC,"Only just bought on the sale too.    So you could ask for leave, sell your armor and then go ask to retire and rejoin with all your stuff back..rinse repeat until you have a ton of gold then go back and buy your stuff back? maybe.. Cheese way.    You could also leave and go buy some granaries and such from guild masters to start making a profit.  Then work as a sellsword for whomever or pledge your vassalage to someone.  I have about 8 business ventures going on along with a fiefdom with the Starks.  Though my Fief gets raided constantly...Just leveling up until I can sack a fort town with a lot of men that will probably be given to some ahole Stark bannerman.

mountandblade,3aswik,Orcrist9000,2,Tue Jun 23 19:10:26 2015 UTC,"I'm slightly annoyed. Hello.  After about a hundred hours into this campaign (most of which was really enjoyable too), I did it. Finally! I cleaned up the Nords, the last faction, and took my rightful place as queen over Calradia. War over, land seized, achievements gotten. Right?  Wrong! I found this piece of shit chilling around at the end of the final battle. At the time I thought ""Oh, hey, a new title for Arwa the Pearled One! Sweet!"" and didn't think much of it. I helped her overthrow Hakim earlier, so she's happy with me. Great. Not great. Not at all. Why? Because, for whatever reason, the Nords will not die. They're immortal. Somehow.  I control every town, castle, and village on the map. The Nords are the only faction left alive, besides my own. Here's the Nordic stats page. Ragnar's fled. Matheas has no troops and he's taking an eternal ""Reconsider my options""-type deal outside of Praven. Still working on converting him. Arwa's listed as a vassal of theirs, and her name's blue on the map, but she's garrisoned in my castle like an ally. I can't fight her as long as she's in there. She's got this ONE Emir still vassaled to her, so I assume she's acting as her own damn faction, and I'm a little desperate to put this run to rest. What do?"
mountandblade,3aswik,Orcrist9000,3,Tue Jun 23 06:30:45 2015 UTC,"I like your faction name a lot. But what's happening seems a bit strange, yeah.   The Nord stat page says you're at peace with them, so that would explain why Arwa can sit in your castle. Factions that are not at war with one another can just enter each other's castles and towns all the time.  It might be that some time must pass before the defeat is properly filed and processed, so to say. How many game days have passed since you took the last fief of the Nords?  Matheas' behaviour is odd though. I don't know why he does that.   Looking at the Nord sheet screen cap I figured you're playing a mod. Google a bit and see if any other people have had a similar problem?   When I played Floris, sometimes lords of defeated factions suddenly joined a faction called Commoners and started raiding random villages. When I defeated such a lord I would get a bunch of red error messages and then he would just leave the game. So maybe your mod (if it's a mod) has some oddities of its own, and chances are somebody else has fixed it already."
mountandblade,3aswik,Orcrist9000,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"I like your faction name a lot.   Thanks! None can stand in our way.   How many game days have passed since you took the last fief of the Nords?   Whoops, I forgot to include that. About 2 in-game months (60-ish days) have passed since the Nords were evicted.   Looking at the Nord sheet screen cap I figured you're playing a mod. Google a bit and see if any other people have had a similar problem?   Ack, should've mentioned that too. It's a very minor mod called Vexed Native to add a few quality-of-life tweaks. Nothing huge. Couldn't find any mod-specific help on Google, either, though it was worth a shot.  I've just been doing quests for Matheas to convert him, but now that you mention it... I could attack him. Be a dick move, sure, but it might force Arwa out of my castle. Maybe that'll trigger the Nord's elimination?"
mountandblade,3aswik,Orcrist9000,2,Tue Jun 23 20:53:41 2015 UTC,"If you can, just try attacking him. That'll get Arwa out. Then attack her. If that doesn't do it, I don't know what will."

You will be fine just defeat few of the Rhodok Lords individually so they will not be able to organize a combined army. Then defend around your Nord Area most of the time and check the Rhodoks every 10-15Days. With two fronts you will not last long as a Marshal anyway.
mountandblade,3astw8,RomeoXak,3,Tue Jun 23 09:30:46 2015 UTC,With two fronts you will not last long as a Marshal anyway.   You don't want to last long as the Marshal in a situation like that - the Controversy you're going to accumulate from every defeat in two different wars will get in the way of things like recruiting new soldiers or being awarded more fiefs (though you may have enough as it is).

I was only Marshal for a week of in-game time, and despite our gains in the field, I accumulated enough controversy that recruits from villages were unwilling to join me. It can also make your existing soldiers start deserting from your army."

mountandblade,3astw8,Super_Jay,6,Wed Jun 24 17:19:57 2015 UTC,"War on two fronts is one time I've been glad not to be the Marshal (I forget, can you renounce it?).

mountandblade,3astw8,someproteinguy,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:11:40 2015 UTC,"You can renounce it when it is offered to you. I accepted it because the two front war thing came after I accepted it. I have an agenda in the Kingdom of Nords, so I accepted it. Maybe I can give it up. My army is only 82 people though. :\"
mountandblade,3astw8,kacman,3,Tue Jun 23 18:54:04 2015 UTC,You can talk to the king and give it up at any time too. I accidentally did this last night. It's one of the options. I would give it up and then personally defend yourself if the Nords attack. If they've lost two cities they probably aren't the strongest and you can fend off most attacks.
mountandblade,3astw8,someproteinguy,2,Tue Jun 23 19:37:27 2015 UTC,"82 shouldn't be too bad, doubly so if you have a few points in tactics to negate the fact you'll be outnumbered much of the time, and triply so if Swadian Knights are well represented in that 82. You may not be able to bust into their capital and fight 600 huscarls, but taking out their wandering armies and maybe a castle or two wouldn't be off the table. Do you have your own town/castle to draw extra troops from after a successful assault?"
mountandblade,3astw8,kacman,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:38:43 2015 UTC,"I have castles, but not many troops are in them. I have garrisoned 115 good infantry troops and crossbowmen in Sargoth, as I think that will be the most threatened. I can pull them from Sargoth at any time. Also, I think i have a few, but very few in a couple of castles."
mountandblade,3astw8,someproteinguy,2,Tue Jun 23 19:44:50 2015 UTC,I would garrison more in all of them before things get too crazy. Both for your reserves and defense. Do you have anyone good at training so you can upgrade them quickly?
mountandblade,3astw8,Super_Jay,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:58:32 2015 UTC,"Ahh, well that's a bummer, sounds like you could have used the time between wars to rebuild a little.   But that's a bit of a personal preference of mine, always nice to have an extra 100 or so mid-low tier troops to quickly rebuild your army and reinforce any newly-acquired holdings (and at that point less of a big deal if the King gives the new castle to someone else). That's in addition to the normal troop garrisons which (again preference here) are maybe 300 or so for a city and 100-150 for a castle.  Sounds like you may be more in a defensive position though, just focus on keeping your lands as safe as possible until you can build up some extra troops to take the fight one direction or the other perhaps?"

mountandblade,3arub3,-ArthurDent-,3,Tue Jun 23 00:20:26 2015 UTC,You need to be the first person to besiege the town to take it. It won't let you besiege a town or castle if you have too small an army. If you want more fiefs go and find some castles that are poorly defended and take those out by yourself. If you request it afterwards it should be given to you.
mountandblade,3arub3,FergasaurusRex,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:13:15 2015 UTC,"I'm doing this right now, though it appears that the Swadians have all of their castles quite well defended. I'm hoping their numbers go down before I run out of money needed to continue paying my troops.  Also, how big does one's army need to be to besiege a town? I can't find anything on the wiki."
mountandblade,3arub3,FergasaurusRex,2,Tue Jun 23 01:44:47 2015 UTC,Not sure to be honest. I normally try to get at least 80-90 before trying it.
mountandblade,3arub3,Super_Jay,2,Tue Jun 23 03:06:37 2015 UTC,"On being awarded fiefs: There's some complex math that goes into it (you can find the formula on the wiki) but it's based on your current number of fiefs, your overall renown, and just plain luck. Focus on increasing your relation with King Ragnar, the current Marshal, and the most influential Nordic lords. You also want to keep increasing your renown by various means - tourneys, battles, etc. The more battles you win against your enemies during wars - especially alongside your fellow lords - the better your reputation will be. If you can convince other lords to support your claim to a fief, their renown will count toward your claim, which is why you want to get in good with the political decision-makers within your kingdom.  Taking castles or cities on your own will increase the chance they'll be awarded to you, but it can still go to other lords. As you're still in the fairly early game, you're unlikely to be able to take any on your own for a while, though, so I wouldn't worry about that until you can field a decent army of 150-200 soldiers or more.   For sieges: the lord who 'controls' the siege is assigned to do so (behind the scenes) by the Marshal of the realm. TMK, it's not possible to be assigned to lead the siege by your Marshal; you'd have to be the Marshal yourself. To lead your own siege, you have to besiege a castle or city on your own, directly (not by joining a siege that's in-progress). You can sometimes do so with some help from other lords by requesting they follow you (or you can suggest they lay siege themselves, and if they trust you, they'll do so and then you can help them).     Basically, to increase your chances of getting better fiefs, you want to spend time doing quests for your liege and your Marshal, on winning victories in the field during wars, on winning tournaments, and on boosting your relations with the upper echelon of the aristocracy so you can enlist their support when an important castle or city is up for grabs. As you become more well-liked and tales of your valor spread throughout the kingdom, the king will look more kindly on your achievements, especially as he'll consider you a personal friend whose aid has proven invaluable to the realm. Good luck!"
mountandblade,3arub3,Super_Jay,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:21:40 2015 UTC,"My main worry is that I won't be able to field any army larger than 50 if I don't get another fief. With the wars I've been in I've only lost money, and significant amounts at that. Jarl Knudarr now seems to own most fiefs taken from the last war and the current one. I do have the support of three jarls though, and since they're willing to follow me, I plan on trying to capture a castle with their help."
mountandblade,3arub3,fanzypantz,3,Tue Jun 23 01:48:38 2015 UTC,"Did you take on vassalage pretty early in the playthrough, I assume? Ideally you want to have some income from something other than your holdings, like business enterprises in cities. (The Dyeworks in Rivacheg will bring you around 1000d each week, for instance.)  If necessary, one decent way to earn money with a smaller army is via bandit-hunting. Spend some cash to supplement your army with Manhunters (light cavalry that you can hire after freeing them from bandits or deserters) and put a couple points in Prisoner Management if you haven't already. Then, go hunting for manageable groups of forest / tundra bandits, sea raiders, deserters, etc - your Manhunters will knock out rather than kill the bandits, so you can take them prisoner and sell them to Random Brokers.   You can also do the Track Down Bandits quests for 1000d each from the Guild Masters. Some of their other quests pay decently as well. Once you get 10,000d together, it's a good idea to start buying Dyeworks in major cities."
mountandblade,3arub3,Cookie_Eater108,3,Tue Jun 23 02:00:46 2015 UTC,"I totally forgot about guildmasters. I'll also definitely take a gander at those business enterprises, as a steady cash flow like that would be lovely."

mountandblade,3an6vd,Gregthenipple,15,Mon Jun 22 15:40:52 2015 UTC,"I used to love that mod.  I always played as a bandit but actually roleplayed the fucking thing. Proper robberies, proper raids etc. No ""GIB 1000G OR I KIL U HUEHUE"".  On the one hand, it helped me sharpen my social skills in some ways, on the other hand it seemed that everyone but me was there to powerplay for some fucking reason:  -Literally every single time I robbed someone in a faction they would be slow as fuck to respond to anything. If I killed them they cried to the admins. If I waited, half their faction ""happened"" to patrol the area.  -Factions that dominated simply never gave a shit. They flat out killed you on sight and if you tried to speak to the admins, half an hour latter they would MAYBE show up and have 5 of that faction argue in broken English that they yelled ""halt"" at you and you didn't halt (of course, they yelled Halt in Russian) so they admins declare it fair game.  -A faction being at war apparently means some asshole with plate and a zweihander can kill any passer bys because you were in a ""warzone"" despite being so fucking far away from the contested city it literally couldn't be seen.  -""HALT OR DIE"". ""Er.....hey, I am just passing by, why the halt?"". ""UR A BANDIT"". ""No sir, I am simply a traveler"". Faggot attacks anyway.  -Some fucking server had the brilliant rule that anyone was allowed to demand you drop your stuff and if you didn't, he was allowed to attack you. What OBVIOUSLY happened was that factions of 10 people were going around with a wagon robbing everyone naked that wasn't also in a faction with 10 people robbing everyone naked.  etc etc  I tried. Had some fun times with this mode but this mode is literally the only time I physically couldn't breathe from anger caused by a video game...and I have 2000 hours clocked in with dota 2."

mountandblade,3an6vd,I_RARELY_RAPE_PEOPLE,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:20:47 2015 UTC,I have some epic good stories from the mod too. Unfortunately it's a mod that you have to strictly admin it and also have a good map with a proper economy and supply lines. People got bored of the valley of swamps and whined about bandit raids on iron even though when they got removed iron suddenly lost all value (because everyone could now mine with no real danger) and excitement of raids and patrols.  I truly think this mod hit on some good ideas (many of whom became even more popular with DayZ and co so that's pretty much a fact at this stage) but should have had less focus on RP and more focus on realistic situations.

mountandblade,3an6vd,I_RARELY_RAPE_PEOPLE,14,Sun Jun 21 23:32:32 2015 UTC,"I havent played MP for months.  It wasn't what I was hoping for.  I'd only play again if it was the co-op type stuff, or line wars.  And as for timing, it was always the same;  someone gets the first swing, well I'm now staggered for them to rapidly swing their weapon.  Block it?  Break sheild eventually.  Try to swing back?  Nah they already swung and staggered me."
mountandblade,3an6vd,ajkl3jk3jk,8,Sun Jun 21 23:44:14 2015 UTC,"The system is balanced and fair, there are a few visual exploits but nothing you can't defeat. The key to enjoying multiplayer is to learn the in depth combat mechanics of MnB. I often see people like yourself who are used to the 'block, attack, repeat' play style that is suitable to singleplayer but any thinking enemy will easily beat someone used to ""AI""."
mountandblade,3an6vd,Langeball,11,Mon Jun 22 03:00:10 2015 UTC,"Yea.  That's why I just flat out refuse to play MP.  Just like Chivalry.  If you haven't already gotten it down/spent several hours learning how alone, you will not be able to play really.  I on't play that kind of game, and that means singleplaer only for me.  And that's just fine by me.  I sure as hell got my money's worth out of sucha  good game, don't need to get angry with the way combat works online"
mountandblade,3an6vd,TipTopToby,2,Mon Jun 22 03:10:16 2015 UTC,"MnB multiplayer has a really steep learning curve and the combat plays a lot differently than single player where the bots have a more uniform attack strategy. Not much of what you learn in single player besides the basic controls really help you I found.  Distance control should be your primary melee concern in multiplayer and it almost doesn't matter in single player. Try to feint into range and get them to swing, then move in and strike before they can recover. Heavy weapons are typically slow but you have to avoid the power blow to use the speed counter. Many two handers cannot be swung close up so if you can push up against them without taking a blow or even taking it on your shield they will not be able to strike at you.  I'm not even that good at it but that is what I go with and I can play passably. Many people are just insanely quick with parries though. I don't play duels, only team games. They best strategy is to try and avoid being out numbered and stay out of situations where you're at a disadvantage (don't go into the open field when there's a lot of cavalry for instance)."

I've had some fun on it before, me and my friends robbed some guy as a joke and joined in some battle and killed a few guys for our faction, it was all pretty cool.  Then we tried it again the next day and it was a mess, full of randomers and clanfags, with no real admining it turns to shit.  I want to enjoy it but I can't really.

PW had that passive expansion through cross-continent consultation where FPW didn't. Australians being a fickle bunch, the next great mod came out and we jumped to that (I believe it was c-rpg), forsaking FPW. The creators abandoned it mid-dev when they saw the reduction in servers and numbers decline rapidly and it became a fond memory. Interestingly FPW had camels before Floris mod.

mountandblade,3aotqb,SuwinTzi,5,Mon Jun 22 07:45:43 2015 UTC,"Floris Mod Pack is obvious choice, if you are looking for upgrade of native game rather than complete overhaul.  Personal skill give bonus only to the character itself. Party skills affect whole party but do not stack, only the highest value is applied (+1/2 of player character skill value I think, at least in Floris), except trainer skill, which does stack. Leadership skills are absolutely useless for companions, as they are not party leaders. Skills work only if companion is conscious. As for building companions, you absolutely need someone who puts all points into intelligence and surgery, first aid and wound treatment. You may consider leveling surgery for one more companion just to be safe, because  skills do not work if companion is wounded and you do not want to loose your surgery skill in the middle of a battle. Other important skills are engineering, tactics, spotting, path-finding and tracking. Training is something I would recommend leveling with surplus points of your intelligence-based companions. The rest of the party should focus on their personal combat skills."
mountandblade,3aotqb,Fgh2,3,Mon Jun 22 10:36:59 2015 UTC,If you want to play the native game but with a bit more of a challenge I would recommend this mod
mountandblade,3aotqb,sdkegg,2,Mon Jun 22 09:58:03 2015 UTC,"Get one on all the medical skills, probably Jeremus.  Get one on pathfinding / spotting / engineering, probably Borcha.  Jeremus and Borcha get nothing but INT and points in those skills. Everyone else gets pure INT too for as much Trainer skill as possible.  Keep them on starting STR and AGR etc, but you can spend leftover skill points on combat stuff. Get someone to do Tactics to the max as well.  You can also have one on Persuasion if you want, to try and convince other kings to stop warring with you, but I've found that even on max persuasion it has little to no effect."
mountandblade,3aotqb,MrWendal,2,Mon Jun 22 11:09:34 2015 UTC,"Hey! I'm relatively new to Warband too and I've been trying to find a mod to improve gameplay but not straying too far from the Native feel.   I have tried Native Mod Compilation (I use the earlier 1.0 version because the latest one has an odd dialogue bug), SnD's Polished Native (which is NMC + Graphics Improvisation), Tocan's Calradia, and Scaedumar. Those mods are among the few that do not change the troop tree radically (as a new player I want to get used to it first) and do not change faction but still offer useful features integrated from other popular mods such as Diplomacy and Prebattle Order. I'm not too sure with Floris as it changes a lot of things (overhauled troops, more in-depth battle tactics mechanics, lots of items that do not fit the era, custom music) and might feel overwhelming for a newcomer. The ""Basic"" pack seems safe though, it only has new items, new texture, and new music.  Tocan's Calradia and Scaedumar feel very similar (both has those gameplay-enhancing features from Diplomacy and Prebattle Order and gameplay addition features such as naval battle, seafaring, stronger bandits/bandit heroes) but in the end I pick Scaedumar because it doesn't meddle at all with the faction. Tocan's Calradia changes the faction a bit (changes people's and kingdom's names, change Swadian King to a queen); if you can live with it I'd recommend Tocan's Calradia as feature-wise it's more interesting."
mountandblade,3aotqb,xaliber_skyrim,2,Mon Jun 22 15:01:30 2015 UTC,"Skills Plan:   2 with Medical Skills: First Aid, Surgery, Wound Treatment. You want a backup for when medic #1 decides he wants to play hero. 2 with Pathfinding & Spotting; one of them gets tracking, one gets looting. Everyone puts at least a couple points into Training once they're about level 10 or so. I usually handle Tactics and Engineering myself after filling up Prisoner Management, Inventory Management, and Leadership to decent levels. Everyone else learns combat skills.   Common weapon choices:   Spearmen: War Spear, Sword, Board Shield, Throwing Spears (because the base game is really lacking for good spearmen). Outrider: Sword, Shield, Bow, Arrows, Steppe Charger. Medics (or any low STR): Lance, Shield, sword, throwing spears, some skill 2 horse. Archer: Crossbow, War Hammer, Board Shield, bolts."

A Thinker Int gets maxed, points into training, tactics, and engineering. A Rider Agility gets maxed, points into looting primarily, probably riding and weapon mastery otherwise.

Looting (and Trade, and Inventory Management) can speed up the early to mid game, but do nothing in the late game, which is where you spend most of your time and where most problems come up. Assuming you want to go all the way.  As for looting towns, i think most players don't.

mountandblade,3aq2ui,treygreen13,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:40:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it knocks them out. I just meant that it takes stuck enemies out of the fight."
mountandblade,3aq2ui,Sea_Raider,4,Mon Jun 22 16:41:50 2015 UTC,A true nord does not need cheats to be a boss!
mountandblade,3aq2ui,wheatjesus,3,Mon Jun 22 20:54:41 2015 UTC,"All the time. Games are supposed to be fun and a lot of m&b mods are aesthetically really cool but make the game way too grindy by making money really hard to come by. Also I don't think it's fun to watch a 1000 man army do a siege after I've died so unless I'm playing a mod like 1257 that lets you play as one of your men I tend to use the health cheat until all my men die. Not to mention when you've almost won a siege but your men can't hit the last guy who's clipping into a wall, you need the kill cheat for stuff like that.   I'm sure some people play this game for the grind but I just like to stab people while leading a huge army and cheats help me get to that part of the game faster.   No shame."
mountandblade,3aq2ui,someproteinguy,2,Tue Jun 23 15:55:21 2015 UTC,"I often get very cheaty when I'm testing things. I like to think this is well-intentioned cheating with the aim of trying to improve the mod with what I learn, but I'm pretty sure part of me just really likes stomping on things now and then.  Most common cheat is using the teleport when playing an all-infantry army. Khergit never knew what hit them."
mountandblade,3aq2ui,Shmoox000,2,Mon Jun 22 18:19:04 2015 UTC,"Depends on what type of game I'm running. If I'm playing an ironman/challenge campaign then no cheating/reloading what so ever. If its a more causal/roleplay campaign then I will a bit. Nothing too drastic, usually just some starting cash/troops and using the see all parties command, find x bandit party is way too annoying otherwise."

mountandblade,3any2s,NativeNazi,8,Mon Jun 22 01:51:35 2015 UTC,"Stay to the edges of enemy forces and focus on cleaning up stragglers. If you charge into a group you're gonna have a bad time. If you're attacking the flanks like you should, then hit and run as soon as they start to face you, then head to the new flank and repeat.   Set lance use to automatic if you're rocking one (You should be)"
mountandblade,3any2s,Dawnisbreaking,3,Mon Jun 22 02:53:44 2015 UTC,"Well first off what weapons are you using? A lance can be difficult and requires a map layout that allows it. I prefer to use a mace and shield, because at lower levels you can get rocked by arrows/bolts pretty quickly.   I like to set my infantry up in a shield wall with some supporting archers and then take my other cavalry men to route the enemy and flank them. Just make sure to keep them in line so a few stragglers don't get caught up in enemy reinforcements alone.   As far as actually attacking people, always ride near the outside. Don't rely on being able to charge through thick masses of troops, you can get caught and slaughtered. Stick to the outside and just swing away and use your shield where appropriate if they're shooting at you. Just ride up to the left or right (outside the masses) of someone and click and drag the mouse back and to the left or right depending on what side they're on. Just keep moving and you'll be good. It all takes practice to get your rhythm down. It also helps to just go for the stragglers and have your troops handle the bulk after you position them well."
mountandblade,3any2s,RomeoXak,3,Mon Jun 22 02:39:25 2015 UTC,"Speed is the Key my friend. Never ever stop to hit a person, if you miss just circle around. Also don't charge straight on an archer they will hit you 99% of the time, approach them on an angle then turn fast when near enough."
mountandblade,3any2s,Frightened_Peasant,3,Mon Jun 22 03:36:58 2015 UTC,I prefer spears to lances.  The Balanced spear is probably my favorite weapon to use while mounted.  They have faster recovery times and are easier to use when a horde of enemies stops your horse.    Just charging straight at a formation of enemies isn't going to work unless you have a lot of heavy cavalry charging with you.  Tactics wise the best thing I have found to do for my army early on is to be the Wild Weasel.  When the enemy gets in range of my archers I ride out and pick one of the bad guys in the back row.  I circle around the enemy and take him out.  Usually after that most of the enemies chase me around so it is easy for me to get them to expose their backs to my archers.  If someone starts getting too close to your people then just chase him down and spear him in the back.    Basically when you are on horseback you act like a wolf.  Use your speed to break up formations and pick enemies off one by one when you get them in a vulnerable position.
mountandblade,3any2s,MrFlabulous,3,Mon Jun 22 03:51:16 2015 UTC,"Get a lance. Couch it. Love it.  If you don't want to use a couched lance (but why on earth wouldn't you?) then get a nice long sword like a khergit sabre. Just remember that while a ""normal"" weapon is great for killing peasants a couched lance can deliver a metric fuckton of damage to anyone. Anyone. Even at low levels you can hit with up to 200 dmg with a good strike, and when you have enough points in polearms you can take out anyone. A god amongst men-at-arms.  Even better is a jousting lance. It doesn't kill, it knocks people out. Seriously, I have taken on 50-60 bandits on my own, and sold the lot as prisoners. Easiest money ever."
mountandblade,3any2s,treygreen13,3,Mon Jun 22 15:07:53 2015 UTC,"In early levels, sit still and fire your bow at the enemy until they are close, then ride to the enemy's flank and charge straight at the guy on the end and run him through. Then loop back around and keep killing them off slowly on the edges until they start to engage your troops.  Once they engage your forces you can ride in and start hacking away. Once the enemy starts to break and rout, I like to chase down the faster stragglers so my troops aren't running all over the map trying to get them. You'll rack up a bunch of XP running down stragglers, so stick to it and keep killing.  Once you're in heavier armor and get a lance you'll be able to join the rest of your men in a central charge and you can really wreck shop."
mountandblade,3any2s,sdkegg,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:04:12 2015 UTC,"The most important tool on horseback is your horse. It is the first thing that you should look to put gold into, as the longer your horse survives in battle, the longer you can survive.   Other than that, if I were playing as cavalry I would recommend taking a shield, 1h sword and throwing weapons if you can afford them. As with any class, it is also important to upgrade you armour,  upgrading boots being more important when playing cavalry as your feet are prone to being hit.   Couching the lance can be done when you are at a sufficient speed by pressing x (if you have lance couching on manual, as I would recommend), reducing the potential length of the weapon but increasing the damage delivered significantly. Lance couching is the most significant advantage of playing as cavalry due to its potential to take out almost any opponent in a single hit.   If you don't have a lot of speed when you are approaching an enemy, or if they lack a weapon with decent reach, then your best option may be to switch to your sword, which allow for a higher amount of damage at slow speeds compared to the lance. It may also be somewhat easier to land a hit with.  Other than that, I would just recommend that you keep playing and get a feel for it. When I started playing I was absolutely atrocious on horseback and would often dismount in order to actually kill someone. Over time you will get a feel for how to play cavalry and eventually be able to use your horse to its full effect, such as by bumping an enemy to stun them, making them drop their blocked shield, and then hitting them with sword or lance. Good luck with Warband and make sure you have fun."
mountandblade,3any2s,Alstorp,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:53:32 2015 UTC,"I'd like to take this thread as an opportunity to ask if there is a way to start combat unmounted while still being mounted in the overworld map?

mountandblade,3any2s,SpookySkeletons,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:29:14 2015 UTC,I don't think it's possible.
mountandblade,3any2s,fanzypantz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:38:43 2015 UTC,I think that is pretty much bound by your inventory. Like if all of your people are sawdian knights your army will move faster than an army of nords only.
mountandblade,3any2s,treygreen13,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:41:18 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, not that I know of. However you can simply dismount at the start of the battle."
mountandblade,3any2s,fanzypantz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:33:14 2015 UTC,"I use a lance in first person. My first attack I just charge a guy at the edge of the enemy because the middle usually just becomes a blob.   Its extremely easy to hit anything with a lance or spear in first person, just move all the time and hit people that stand alone and not directly looking at you. When you start the lance/spear attack you still have control over it so don't stop aiming the moment you start your attack, lead your spear into the guy while you attack because you can often misinterpret how long you have to attack. They will block you most of the time if they are focused on you."
