After a transceiver it is converted into an rx and tx line, but the main communication is over 2 wires that are a differential pair.  And just because CANBus is ""broadcast oriented"" doesn't mean you can't request data to be sent from a module.  But maybe your point is that you can just not connect the TX line up to the Microcontroller?  That would be an odd setup, as it could now not make any requests for information or report status to the main computer.  The best way to separate the traffic is to have another device that has multiple CANBus's hooked up to it that it directs traffic between, but I'm pretty sure thats how most cars do it already."

The airbag computer needs the vehicle speed to determine which and how many airbags and stages to deploy.  The Radio needs vehicle speed to automatically turn up the volume at highway speeds(thanks GM). The Body control computer needs the fuel injector duty cycle to compute gas mileage and show it on your dash. The tranmission computer needs to know engine calculated torque output from the ECU, and needs to know vehicle speed from the airbag computer.    And so on and so on, with many variations for models and equipment.    So what we wind up with is a modern vehicle with a number of modules that all serve a purpose that are networked together.

The controversy has flared anew as legislators, educators and others take steps to remove Confederate symbols on public display across the South after nine black worshippers were fatally shot in Charleston, South Carolina.

We hold as undeniable truths that ... the servitude of the African race ... is mutually beneficial to both bond and free, and is abundantly authorized and justified by the experience of mankind, and the revealed will of the Almighty Creator ...”  The only right that Southern states were fighting for was the right to own slaves, say critics of the textbooks, comparing their portrayal of the Civil War’s causes as a distortion comparable to the way the statues and flags honor a racist heritage.  The State Board of Education adopted the standards in May 2010 on a 9-5 vote after a bitter debate, with Republican board members voting for them, saying they would rectify liberal bias in the way Texas taught history. Democrats voted against the standards.  “There would be those who would say, you know, automatically say the reason for the Civil War was over slavery,” board member Patricia Hardy, R-Fort Worth, said during one meeting. “No. It was states’ rights.”  The standards also don’t require textbooks to include material on Jim Crow laws that perpetuated segregation or on the Ku Klux Klan. But the Texas Education Agency said a review showed that publishers on the list of textbooks the board approved last fall did include those subjects in their books.  Last year, facing renewed criticism about the standards, the board’s chairwoman, Barbara Cargill, R-The Woodlands, said the new materials were “much more fair and balanced than they were before.”  Some districts have chosen to pick books that are off the state’s approved list, taking advantage of a 2011 state law that gave districts more freedom in purchasing books. Most districts still buy books from the list.  Textbooks remain an important resource, but teachers rely on their training and judgment, said Steve Antley, a sixth-grade social studies teacher in Houston Independent School District, the state’s largest. The district is ordering state-approved social studies textbooks from the publishing company Pearson for middle school use but is no longer buying printed textbooks for its high schools, instead using online materials, spokeswoman Holly Huffman said.  “I don’t think there’s really the danger that some agenda can be pushed into (the standards) and that’s somehow going to impact all the kids in Texas,” said Antley, who represents HISD educators as president of the Congress of Houston Teachers. “In the end, teachers are still making decisions about how to teach the course.”  Leslie Price, San Antonio Independent School District spokeswoman, said the district adopted state-approved social studies textbooks for both middle and high school.  Northeast Independent School District also follows the state-approved list of social studies textbooks, spokeswoman Aubrey Chancellor said."

news,3e2nbl,hseldon10,16,Tue Jul 21 17:09:53 2015 UTC,"Mexico's constitution forbade slavery since 1820s. It was more of a non-enforcement than an allowance of slaves. When the issue became so prominent, the government started enforcing the law.  And it is a lie that the two side ""despised"" each other. Mexicans didn't really care all that much, as long as the immigrants complied with local laws. It's when the immigrants stopped compliance, particularly with taxation and slavery, that the central Government started reigning down on illegal activity."
news,3e2nbl,discipula_vitae,25,Tue Jul 21 17:24:16 2015 UTC,"Well the slave owner immigrants that settle Texas (that were brought in because Mexico was having trouble with Native Americans raiding their settlements) were enticed by giving extra land for every slave they brought over.   Also they had next to zero representation in the Mexican government. They were essentially a people group being ruled by a completely different people group.   Also, your recollection of events is off. Bustamante enforced higher taxes, cut off immigration to Texas, and abolished slavery. Then the Texians just started ignoring the laws. Santa Anna came in and pretty much threw all of that out (slavery had been abolished previously so it stuck), but then got worried about the Texians being organized.   His government tried to take a few measures to make sure the Texians wouldn't revolt (think of the canon at Gonzales), and that was enough of an aggression to start the war.  Slavery was definitely a major player in why the Texians felt they didn't have power, but it was completely different than the American Civil War. The Texians did not have any power. They were being ruled by a different culture, and being unfairly taxed and legislated against.   It didn't help that Santa Anna wasn't really a good guy any way. So all of that, went toward the Texas War for independence. I think most people looking back on history would have expected the Texians to revolt regardless of whether or not they were slave holders, where in the US south, I think most look back and history and see that the Civil War wouldn't have happened had their not been slavery."

Democrats had picked up the banner of Civil Rights which allowed the Republicans to drive the wedge between the South an the Democrats. The Republicans aggressively went after the South in an attempt to break the stranglehold that Democrats had on the Federal Government since the Great Depression.

As we lack the moral perfection required to judge others, we should treat everyone well, and let God sort em out afterwards.

They have all paid taxes in the community, paying for police and fire protection you rely upon, roads on which you and your customers access your business and, ideally, they add to the social fabric and demographics that make the city a worthwhile place to run the business. In other words, you don't get to reap all the benefits of running a business in location X but pick and choose the people in location X with whom you will do business.

Then those who say such things get all their info from script readers on television, so they don't see the days people spend wearing the soles off their feet to find work that they're denied, get evicted from low income housing when their persistence and hard work earns them better pay, nor the fact that if all else fails, when you want out of poverty you are still racing against an arrest lottery that will see you incarcerated without a trial after not committing a crime because the justice system is overburdened and underfunded.  They don't see the two income households working three to four jobs and still making too little to so much as pay a car note.    There's nothing wrong with conservatism.  If only people like SenorPuff knew that they're neoliberals who only call themselves ""conservative"" so they can feel like they're in the ""right""."

There are too many factors that go into a country's tax laws and it's not as simple as the biggest nations deciding there will be no more tax havens. Different cultures, different economies, different views on taxation, different needs for the country.   Also, taxes are really complicated. That's why there's individual tax accountants, accountants for corporations, even accountants for trusts and estates. The domestic tax situation is just as complicated as the global one. You cannot just issue a flat tax across the board and expect it to work at all. There are many laws, regulations, codes, and more that go into tax. It's a tangled mess. Corporations also make up $300 billion in income a year for the nation. That will not be reduced or eliminated ever as well.   These are 'loopholes' per say, as many people think. These are legal maneuvers to pay less taxes and politicians who make these laws know about them. For example, you mentioned dividend income should be treated as normal income. Well when I company makes that money it pays taxes on the profit. After that corporate tax is paid, then dividends are issued and taxed at a lower rate. It might be a lower rate BUT they're hitting you twice on the same money, called double taxation.   There are many different reasons as to why America won't ever have a flat tax, one of them being that I wouldn't have a job :), but it just cannot happen and definitely won't."

Let your state have a bit more power over you, cause you could cross the stateline if you needed to.

Let your city have even more power, sure, cause you could  move just down the road to a new zip code if you'd like in less than 6 months.

Apparently there was a blind old woman in a wheelchair and someone had stolen her purse. I thought it was sad, but the black guy was completely broken up by it. ""Who does something like that to an old woman in a wheelchair?"" he asked me, heartbroken. ""Who does something like that? She's blind and they took her purse?"" He was choking back tears- and this was a huge man, over 6 feet tall and really muscular, trying not to cry over a woman he didn't know getting robbed.  And it all just melted away. This guy wasn't a person ""just like me"", he was a way better person than I was. And here I am trying not to judge him for the color of his skin! Suddenly it was obvious that that didn't make a fucking bit of difference, and not in an intellectual, all-people-are-created-equal kind of way, but on an emotional gut level. It just cut right through all the bullshit in a way that 30 hours of diversity classes or a million hours of hanging out with black people ""just like me"" never could.  Obviously that's not the same story as a diehard racist in the KKK. And maybe this incident won't change the way he feels- but then again, maybe it will. And if it doesn't help him, maybe it will help a thousand people like me."

It's amazing how in 2015 it's still possible to never interact with people that form a substantial minority in the US and how separation still exists (not implying that it's on purpose). When you realize that it definitely helps explain how that intense 1950s style racism still exists in certain places. But the way you describe learning to see someone from a different racial group as just another person is awesome, obviously the goal isn't to pretend differences don't exist but to see people as people and not defined by their race etc. The goal should be to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and assume they're overall good and not allow stereotypes to cloud your view. Not to say that some stereotypes aren't somewhat based on reality but never assume them.  Bigots are incredibly good at mental gymnastics though as every race (or any grouping of people) have stereotypes that are usually at least slightly based in reality but bigots either claim the ones against their group aren't true or aren't really bad. Terrorists are Arab, gangsters are black, jews are greedy bankers, white people are racist and intolerant of other cultures, asians are robots and on it goes. Sure there are some examples that show those stereotypes otherwise the stereotype wouldn't exist (although historically some stereotypes are pure fiction created to justify hatred) but who benefits from assuming the stereotype instead of assuming the best? If anything it makes people who get treated based off of those stereotypes think ""well if they're going to assume I'll be that way no matter what I do I may as well act the part."" Paint people into corners and they won't react positively.  This was long and unnecessary hah. Just wanted to say I appreciated your story and you definitely didn't need to make a throwaway, you can't control where you come from and how those people act, you can only control what type of person you are and you chose to be better than what your environment would naturally produce. If more people were like you true bigotry would become rare.  Race and most other groupings are arbitrary ways to separate people anyways, they're man made and the people who care a lot about them (other than sociologists etc) typically give those groupings importance to make themselves feel better and hate others. If we just called good people good people and assholes assholes illogical hate would disappear pretty quickly and the number of people exemplifying those stereotypes would drop as people won't feel the need to defend them just because they fall into the same group and understand lashing out against unfair judgment."

The strong insinuation there, given the context of this entire conversation, is that gated communities and private schools are, today, segregationist tools heavily used to perpetuate that separation. That is purely false in this day and age. The attraction is educational for a great many people, because public school systems even in well to do areas have less appeal than they did even a decade or two ago.

Years later new evidence was found in his case that allowed him to challenge his conviction based on DNA evidence. They had found some underwear with blood on them - the girl was trying to fight off her attacker and scratched him up - at the house where the crime took place shortly after the conclusion of the trial and the man spent years trying to appeal based on the new evidence.

In all seriousness though, and not to be a dick about it, but ""poverty"" in this study is undefined. There is no definition of what constitutes poverty anywhere within the study. None.   If you're going to quantify the number of people living in poverty, it would be helpful to define what it is.  I'm not suggesting it doesn't exist. However, I've seen the definition expend in the past and it would not surprise me to find that the increase is again due to an expansion of the definition.   It's no different, really, than the shrinking definition of unemployment. Everyone knows that if we defined it now the way it was defined in the depression, it would be close to double what it is.  Statistics are always selected to serve a narrative. Poverty is definitely a problem, wage disparity is part of it, red states are part of it (look at the map in the report of the most impoverished states and compare that to the states that refuse federal funds to expand medicaid), food deserts is another part, etc. But, it's difficult to fix a problem if you refuse to quantify it."

It cites all its references, and later in the document (page 47) it specifies that they are using an absolutely standard definition of poverty.  The journalists from the NY Times and Time magazine should have mentioned this.   Children in poverty is the percentage of children under age 18 who live in families with incomes below 100 percent of the U.S. poverty threshold, as issued each year by the U.S. Census Bureau. In calendar year 2013, a family of two adults and two children fell in the “poverty” category if their annual income fell below $23,624. Poverty status is not determined for people living in group quarters, such as military barracks, prisons and other institutional quarters, or for unrelated individuals under age 15 (such as foster children). The data are based on income received in the 12 months prior to the survey. SOURCE: U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey"

news,3e2ft1,cybermage,0,Tue Jul 21 16:58:58 2015 UTC,"As a side note, any government assistance received does not count towards 'income'.

news,3e2ft1,libsmak,4,Tue Jul 21 16:56:34 2015 UTC,"Which, from a data analysis perspective, is really important to keep track of.  If every time somebody in poverty received assistance, which temporarily raised their annual worth above the poverty line, they then became recorded as 'not impoverished' it would be extremely difficult to keep track of the interplay between poverty and poverty benefits.  Indeed, if the design of the benefit structure was to raise an applicants 'benefits adjusted income' above 100% of the poverty line, then we would rarely ever see any impoverished person receiving benefits - precisely because benefits that work as designed would remove an applicant from poverty."

There are two definitions of poverty: absolute poverty, often used by the UN and international NGOs -- for example defining poverty as someone who lives on $4 per day or less. This standard works better for measuring access to real material goods like electricity, water, shelter, food, AC.   The other definition is relative poverty, which this article and nearly all articles of this type use. The poverty line is often set at 60% of the median national income or thereabouts, like the ~$23k line mentioned in the article. There are arguments for this type of definition, showing how wealth is distributed in a society and stuff, but that stat says far more about distribution of wealth than absolute wealth levels. It's easy to see how this definition can be used to warp and distort the common sense definition of being ""in poverty"".   If you're at 60% of the median income in the richest country on earth, you're going to have far more wealth and access to goods on an absolute level, than someone who has an average or even above-average income in a far poorer nation. The average child in (relative) poverty in the US is at least an order of magnitude WEALTHIER, then an average child in say India, or Brazil, or Russia. I would take a slightly below average income in the US rather than a slightly above average income in India any day.   Not saying this to diminish the hardship and difficulty of being poor in the US, but this stats-based-bullshitting is repeated so often and no one ever clears it up. Cheers."

I've heard two conflicting stories, one being that the child was crying for over 40 minutes as the parents did nothing, the other being the manager was exaggerating and it was more like 5-10 minutes. So, I don't feel like I can truly take a side.  Anyways, it's normal for a child that age to cry when they're hungry. However, you need to bring something to occupy them as they wait. When my children were small, I'd bring little snacks (such as Cheerios or the little Gerber fruit snacks) or toys for them so they wouldn't get antsy waiting for their food. Kids cry, but parents need to be proactive to avoid this scenario.   If you aren't proactive and your child is crying and you can't stop them, then you get up and walk out. I've left my husband in a restaurant with my daughter to finish eating and pay our check while I took our son to the car during a tantrum. Everyone else in the restaurant is paying for a nice meal. They don't want to, nor do they deserve, to hear someone else's child crying and screaming.  I do think it would have been in better taste for the manager to walk to the table and ask them to try and calm their child down or leave. If they refused, call the cops. I also think whoever is in charge of their social media site should have handled the situation better, and not called the child ""retarded"" and attacking people replying to the thread the child's mother posted to the restaurant's Facebook (which have since been deleted).  Children or not, I would not want to eat at a restaurant where the manager yells at patrons instead of speaking to them directly. That, in my opinion, is just bad taste."

news,3e2r8h,BrutalCunt,4,Tue Jul 21 18:55:12 2015 UTC,"There's actually a long-standing academic criticism of politicians like Sanders and how they handle race. It's helpful to understand the historical context of liberal white political allies to black civil rights causes. Jim Crow laws popped up not only because of conservative reactionaries who hated black people; they also gained political support when carpet bagger white liberals in the South realized that they could get votes by channeling angry white people against blacks. In short, post-Reconstruction ended with a widespread betrayal of black constituents. Black political representation was better and higher under Reconstruction than it would be for another 100 years -- they actually went backwards when white liberals stopped supporting black political allies.  A similar problem occurred in the 70's with the War on Drugs. White liberals and black civil rights leaders considered themselves fairly close following the wave of the Civil Rights Movement in the 60's, but that changed in the 70's when Republicans made the War on Drugs their #1 political issue. It didn't take long for Democrats to start making the same arguments for their own political advantage; Clinton rode that wave better than even Reagan.  Black civil rights leaders have been criticizing Sanders' brand of colorblind civil rights advocacy for a long time. They are concerned (and I would say they have a legitimate basis to be concerned) that Sanders' camp is too focused on financial issues like college loan debt and housing debt, without paying enough attention to other urgent issues like the criminal justice system and the astronomical rates of incarceration for black people, or the housing and credit discrimination that black people all over the country face.  I still think bursting onto the stage and interrupting Sanders rally is a bad call, but you need to understand more about the political landscape with these two groups before you can appreciate why they thought it was necessary to interrupt each other. There are a lot of black civil rights leaders who simply do not trust Sanders' base to help them, and they may in the end be right to have that distrust."

His base is primarily white millennial students and older white liberals -- i.e. a constituency makeup akin to people who live in Vermont. When it actually comes to his outreach on issues affecting specifically black and Hispanic people, he's not doing very well.  Rick Wade, Obama for America's African-American vote director, knows what he's talking about when he talks about this issue, and he had largely negative things to say: ""I haven't seen him engaging the black community. Nor am I hearing any chatter about him. Black voters don't know him."" A June CNN/ORC poll showed just 2% of black Democrats supporting Sanders, a figure that has remained unchanged since February. Among non-white voters overall, Sanders polls at 9% compared to Hillary Clinton's 61%. That's huge.  Yes, he's got an extreme disadvantage competing against Hillary, but the proportion of people of color who support him is WAY SMALLER than the proportion of white democrats who support him. He does not have endorsements from black political allies, and the political issues his camp actually advertises tend to be about finances for young people, finances for retired people, finances for middle class families, marijuana legalization, and money and speech in politics. These are all issues that impact the African American community just as much as any other, but Sanders' campaign could be doing a lot more to distinguish himself from Hillary's traditionalist hawk/tough-on-crime democrat shadow.

People keep saying this but I have yet to see any proof that this is true. I am black and I like Bernie, but the whole point of the protest is to get him to speak to the specific issues of our community in more detail.    ""By doing that, they're also pissing off Bernie supporters who are, coincidentally, also people that are more likely to be sympathetic to their cause""    There is some truth to this, but there is another way to look at it. The black community has been a solid Democratic voting block for decades and have helped every modern Democratic president get his office. So to all my fellow liberals I say, you are welcome. If Bernie and his supporters want him to get the nomination you need our votes. If you want our votes then you need to address what we deem to be our issues, not what you tell us our issues are.

So, instead of asking for specific protection only to black people, how about we extend it to all humans? You know? Doesn't matter what color skin the person was, a human was killed by the cops. Human lives matter. African Americans shouldn't be considered wholly separate from the issue; it would be a slap in the face of every Civil Rights activist who tried to prove the point that blacks are just as equal as any other human.   Nobody screamed ""Mixed lives matter!"" when that toddler was hit with a flashbang.  Nobody screamed ""White lives matter!"" when Dillon Taylor was shot, because he unaware of the cops yelling at him; due to his headphones.  I don't think there was anyone making a huge case with the homeless population when James Boyd was shot.  I understand that there are problems with the police and the black community. However, cops with poor trigger discipline are a problem that isn't limited solely to the black community, and these conflicts typically end up having similar circumstances (somebody being severely wounded, or killed).   If we allow ourselves to be distracted by race every time a human rights violation pops up in the US, it will never truly be addressed and solved as we'd all busy fighting and arguing with each other, rather than combating the violators themselves."

The benefit of owning a home comes from being able to do what you want with it, not sharing a wall with a neighbor (unless you own a condo), potentially a lot more space, and building equity.

When the economy tanks again (likely due to this very article) home prices are going to be killed because people won't be able to afford them. Home prices can't go up when wages go down or stay the same. The cost of everything is going up MUCH faster than ever before while wages are stagnant or rising at a very slow pace. The current state of the economy leads to a major correction in the future which will kill the housing market again. Its just a matter of time.
news,3e2j95,Homie_Bama,5,Tue Jul 21 18:18:35 2015 UTC,"Right now there is a severe lack of supply in the housing market for 2 reasons. Existing homes are gobbled up by real estate companies that wanna rent them and very low number of new constructions. Both these reasons are pushing prices up due to the demand far outpacing supply.   Once rates go up, the cheap loans will make it harder for real estates companies to snatch up hundreds of houses off the market. If builders start ramping up construction then supply will be better. But if those things don't happen I don't see a quick end to this.   Additionally rent for homes and apartments are higher due to the high level of bankruptcy filings since 2008. Once those BKs pass the 5-7 years aging people that are now renting that could afford to buy a house will do just that. I know quite a lot of people that strategically defaulted on their loan due to being upside down that have the cash for 20-30% down payments right now but won't qualify for financing for he rest due to recent foreclosure or bankruptcy.

As for the arrest not being enough to drive a depressed person to suicide, I personally have, during particularly dark periods, seriously considered it over far less than an arrest.

It's not because he paid the toll (or actually paid part of the toll as he told the driver the incorrect amount initially), or even that he had paid tolls and been warned about it previously. It's that he, in his own words, said he's done this for years and he'd pay a toll one day and take it out of the till the next day or another time to pay himself back. With that kind of attitude there's no way to ever tell that he wasn't skimming; that kind of thing would get you fired in any service industry job.  Source;  Samsonov says he charged a trailer driver too little last week, and when he realized his mistake, paid the five dollars owed out of his own pocket. He says it was something he did from time to time if a driver didn't have enough cash. I'd put the six dollars in, I got the six dollars back the next day, Samsonov said."

news,3e2uhs,helpmeredditimbored,24,Tue Jul 21 15:09:45 2015 UTC,"Let me get this straight: A fight breaks out on the street.  One of the people in the fight gets chased into a Target, where the man takes a girl hostage, and tells his pursuers to let him go, or he will stab the girl.  The pursuers do not let him go, and he stabs the girl.  The girl's family then sues Target, because clearly it is entirely Target's fault that the girl got stabbed.  Target then seeks to add the pursuers as parties to the lawsuit, because, to the extent that Target can be found to have any responsibility for this, they think that the jury should also be able to consider whether the men who chased the attacker into the store bear any responsibility as well.   I am having a real hard time finding any outrage at Target for this one.  The whole lawsuit seems frivolous to me.  From those facts, I would think that the only responsible party would be the attacker.  The reason that Target is getting sued is because they have money and the attacker doesn't.  Essentially, they are guilty of ""having money in the vicinity of a crime"".    This is pretty much exactly how most civil litigation goes.  There is a fucked up situation with various people/entities involved, and someone gets hurt.  The person that gets hurt sues the richest person that had some tangential involvement in the situation, because they mostly just care about getting money, not about ""justice"", and most of the people involved in the situation have no money.  The rich person that gets sued then has to file a pleading with the court that essentially says ""there were other people involved in this situation, and it is not fair to consider my liability for the harm, without also considering whether the other people involved also had some culpability.""  In other words, this isn't ""Target suing hero"", this is ""Family files frivolous lawsuit against Target, Target has no choice but to defend itself by pointing out that there were other people involved in the situation."""

My parents being supportive resulted in me being socially well adjusted and having many healthy relationships. Moreover, the way they didn't repress my natural interest in the opposite sex has made me more willing to openly talk about my relationships with them.

""Possession"" means carrying the weapon with you or having the weapon within your immediate reach and having the intent to use it while committing a crime.  The mandatory minimum sentences for aggravated assault and battery when in possession of a firearm or destructive device are:  Aggravated assault: minimum three years imprisonment while in possession of gun or destructive device  Aggravated battery: minimum ten years imprisonment while in possession of gun or destructive device, and  If the weapon is a semi-automatic weapon or a machine gun: minimum fifteen years imprisonment.  (Fla. Stat. § 775.087).  Firearm Enhancement Penalties: Discharge of Weapon  If an offender discharges a firearm or destructive device during the commission of an aggravated assault or battery, the mandatory minimum sentences required are:  Discharging any firearm or destructive device: minimum twenty years, and If any firearm or destructive device is discharged resulting in death or great bodily harm: minimum twenty-five years (and maximum life sentence). In addition to the mandatory minimum prison sentence, the court may sentence someone convicted of aggravated assault or battery who carried or used a firearm to any other prison time authorized by the aggravated assault and battery statutes.  (Fla. Stat. § 775.087).  Habitual Offender Sentence Enhancement  If someone convicted of an assault or battery with a firearm or destructive device has a criminal record, particularly prior convictions for assault or battery or other violent crimes, that defendant is subject not only to the mandatory minimum sentence for the firearm and the sentence for the aggravated assault or battery, but also to additional imprisonment because of his habitual offender status.

The typical response is that the driver could get drunk while driving. But they could also get drunk before driving, and either way once they go over the per say limit it is illegal. Open container laws have no exemption for passengers.   Now let's say that you and your SO go for a road trip but they are  a medical marijuana patient. It is now illegal for your SO to use their medication while someone else drivers. It's still illegal for them to drive stoned, taking away open container laws does not change that.

A lot of things can be intoxicating, but not like alcohol.  ""Drinking alcohol clearly has important effect on social behaviors,such as increasing aggression, self-disclosure, sexual adventuresomeness, and so on. Research has shown that these effects can stem from beliefs we hold about alcohol effects. Less is known about how alcohol itself affects these behaviors. A cognitive explanation, that alcohol impairs the information processing needed to inhibit response impulses--the abilities to foresee negative consequences of the response, to recall inhibiting standards, and so on--has begun to emerge. We hypothesize that alcohol impairment will make a social response more extreme or excessive when the response is pressured by both inhibiting and instigating cues--in our terms, when it is under inhibitory response conflict. In that case, alcohol's damage to inhibitory processing allows instigating pressures more sway over the response, increasing its extremeness. In the present meta-analysis, each published test of alcohol's effect on a social, or socially significant behavior was rated (validated against independent judges) as to whether it was under high or low inhibitory conflict. Over low-conflict tests, intoxicated subjects behaved only a tenth of a standard deviation more extremely than their sober controls, whereas over high-conflict tests they were a full standard deviation more extreme. The effect of conflict increased with alcohol dosage, was shown not to be mediated by drinking expectancies, and generalized with few exceptions across the 34 studies and 12 social behaviors included in this analysis."""

It is illegal to modify the way an abortion is performed for the purpose of maintaining fetal integrity.  The first video mentioned doing this explicitly - using ultrasound to direct forceps grip, changing the presentation from vertex to breach. So does this second video, when it discusses using a manual suction technique instead of a motorized section technique. This is explicitly against the law, and the agreement PP makes with the fetal hosts (""patients"") (which agreement is mentioned in this video as well.)  Let's grant for the moment that all of the money changing hands is purely for covering costs. Is there any argument as to why changing the procedure, illegally, to increase the chances of getting ""research-able"" fetal tissue, should be ignored?  By the way, the fact that PP doctors care so much about ""donating"" the tissue that they will modify the abortion procedure to ensure intact tissue strongly implies that they are profiting from the tissue donation. Or that they just really, really care about that research."

As far as what was changed, you should watch both videos if you haven't already.   In video 1, the PP representative discusses multiple modifications to the abortion procedure, including:   Using ultrasound to guide the gripping location of forceps, so as to avoid fragmenting the thorax, increasing the chance of harvesting viable livers and kidneys. Inverting the fetus' presentation from vertex (head first) to breach (feet first). She stated that the reason was cervical/vaginal dilation tends to increase as the procedure moves forward, such that  when the head exits first, it is crushed (and brain tissue rendered unsuitable for some research purposes). This would be the case in vertex presentation. In breach presentation the head is the last part of the fetus to exit, and has a higher chance of ""surviving"" the procedure intact, thereby enhancing its research applications.   In video 2, the PP representative discusses how for young fetuses (around 9-12 weeks gestation), the standard automated vacuum procedure tends to fragment the fetus, reducing the chance that any tissue can be used for research. But she revealed that in the past they have used, and can use if these ""tissue buyers"" (i.e. the lying interviewers) would prefer, a manual suction technique which is much gentler and has a better chance of liberating usable tissue.  I think any reasonable person who watched these statements should conclude that the portion of the 1993 Act I quoted and referenced above might have some legal bearing here. Do you disagree?"

If what she's doing is completely on the level, shouldn't she say, ""let me see what it costs us to get the tissue and get it to you. That's all we charge and all we're allowed to charge."" That would seem more appropriate than admitting that, while they're not supposed to change treatment to patients for the sake of getting tissue, she doesn't want to make it an issue."
news,3e2p57,MarvinTheMartianMD,0,Tue Jul 21 15:04:11 2015 UTC,"When did she say she wanted to do more than break even? I cannot find where that was said.   Secondly It is not unreasonable to think that any entity doing a transfer of tissue might not make a profit on the transfer. If the price paid minus the cost of tissue transfer is less than the cost of disposal than it makes business sense to do the transfer. For example, lets say it costs 120 per tissue transfer and they get paid 100. PP would be at a loss of 20, now if it costs 25 to properly dispose of tissues, then PP is looking at a 5 loss compared to a 25.  It is compounded by the fact that they are a non profit and might be willing to take a loss to facilitate a transfer.  This video, in particular, could easily be said to follow how you think it should go. The PP doctor clearly doesn't know the average shipping/storage costs. She says multiple times, ""I will have to find what is paid in other sites."" meaning she doesn't know the shipping or whether the other sites take a loss.   It is easy to look at a video that contains something you disagree with, abortion in this case, and immediately assume and see the worst. I am not sure any of these practices would have the same  outrage if the doctor was with a local hospital and the recorder pretended to represent the Body Farm in Nashville, TN."
news,3e2p57,dancemart,7,Tue Jul 21 16:05:34 2015 UTC,"My mistake. The ""break even"" comment came from the first video released. Of course, that suggests the first video was more than just overblown hype.   Second, the concerning part of this video is that the lady appears completely unconcerned with cost analysis like what you're presenting, unless we give her a huge benefit of the doubt and take her comments about checking with other affiliates to mean she's actually not trying to elevate the price above what they need. Even if we assume that in her favor, and disregard the off-color joke about the Lamborghini, the earlier part of the video shows haggling, afraid she won't get a high enough price. Which would be fine, except that it's illegal for her to make a profit. Not just that it raises questions if they profit, but it's a violation of federal statute for them to make a profit. That's why she shouldn't be negotiating a price, THEN saying she'll see what their costs are. The correct negotiation would be: ""Let me check with my people and see what our costs are. That's what the price will be. Can't haggle.""   Instead, she said she would change the cost if PP was being LOW-BALLED. There was no mention of ""if that's too high, we'll make sure we're not profiting."" Even though that should be a major concern if she were worried about compliance with federal law."
news,3e2p57,MarvinTheMartianMD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:50 2015 UTC,"The break even comment was, ""I think for affiliates, at the end of the day, they’re a nonprofit, they just don’t want to — they want to break even. And if they can do a little better than break even, and do so in a way that seems reasonable, they’re happy to do that. Really their bottom line is, they want to break even. Every penny they save is just pennies they give to another patient. To provide a service the patient wouldn’t get."" With full context actually says nothing illegal... She was clearly talking about the bottom line of an affiliate, not a particular transfer. It is myopic to say that she was talking about a particular transfer.  ""actually not trying to elevate the price above what they need."" What evidence in the video is there to her trying to elevate the price higher than she needs?   "" the earlier part of the video shows haggling, afraid she won't get a high enough price. Which would be fine, except that it's illegal for her to make a profit."" Why does haggling with a price = her making a profit? Even if she haggled above the cost for a transfer, that does not mean the recipient was charged above the transfer cost. It is easier to tell someone we are charging you less than more.   You seem to think that when someone throws out ball park numbers they are giving in absolute terms what the cost of something will be. If I ask a contractor, ""How much would it cost to redo my bathroom?"", and he goes ""Well I will have to check, but 3000 seems right."" Then he is obligated to make me pay exactly 3000? I will pay only 3000, no more, no less? Sorry none of this works that way.   And then she made a joke, STOP THE PRESSES, someone made an inappropriate joke. I am going to run to my local congressman to outlaw jokes immediately. None of this means what you think it does, simply because of the myopic lens you are viewing from."
news,3e2p57,dancemart,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:52:04 2015 UTC,"The evidence of her trying to elevate the price above what she needs is her trying to get the company she's bargaining with to commit to as high a price as they are willing to without first finding out what she needs. Sure, it's easier to tell someone you don't need as much money from them. But she doesn't imply that she would do that. She just reserves an out in case others charge more, without regard to what the actual costs are. Is this enough for a jury to convict? No. Would sales receipts be better evidence? Yes. The point is: she's trying to negotiate them up without regard for how much it's going to cost.   Arguably, a flat rate contract for tissue of this kind would be illegal if it in fact resulted in PP or an affiliate getting a profit of any kind. Why? Because the law is that the person providing the tissue cannot sell for valuable consideration."
news,3e2p57,MarvinTheMartianMD,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:12:36 2015 UTC,"You are making a whole range of assumptions to make PP seem culpable in something they are not. First you are assuming the numbers thrown out here are final. There is no reason to think that and if you are familiar with the way negotiations happen, then there is good reason to think that they aren't final.  You are also assuming that she has no idea what costs are. She most likely has some ballpark figures and wants to set expectations. In fact all she would need to know to fit your, somewhat unrealistic, standards of how a negotiation should go, is that it costs more than 100 on average per sample.   In fact, it is impossible for her to not, ""negotiate them up without regard for how much it's going to cost."", because shipping and storing costs are variable. You expect her to say, it will costs you 19.99 cause that is exactly the cost of storing and shipping in every single case of storing and shipping. Even if she checked on the cost that number may still be above the costs of shipping and storing. The only sane way to view numbers thrown out in this type of negotiation is ballpark, and max you are willing to pay type numbers.  Also a flat rate contract would be fine, as long as the remainder was returned to the purchaser, or the cost of storing and shipping was greater than the flat rate.   Basically you give an unrealistic expectation of how first time ball park meetings go."

A prison warden (or whatever the top official's name is) visited Scandinavia to tour their more humane prisons and essentially his comments were something to the extent of:  This would never work in New York, if you commit a crime, you give up your rights to be treated humanely.   There was an instance where a Scandinavian inmate refused to be interviewed and pulled their shirt over their head so as to not be identified.   The NY state official said in NY that would not be tolerated. He'd be forced to interview and if he didn't comply, whatever that inmate enjoyed the most would be taken from him. Such as, he referenced an inmate who enjoyed walks outside. They'd threaten to take  outdoor privileges away for a few weeks to coerce the prisoner's compliance.   I really think that our mindset towards punishment, criminals, jail and detention for use to correct behavior should be fully overhauled.   But too often it seems that jail is a punishment in which others gain some sort of satisfaction... Like the ""tough on crime"" mantra they've been using for at least the past 20 years.   If we're so damn tough on them, they'll just come out worse. No freaking wonder it's a zoo in there.   But hearing the words come from the NY state correction officer's mouth made me cringe. He's completely indoctrinated into this mindset and as he's a top official, he passes that mentality down the chain of command. So, I don't see it ending anytime soon.   It's a shame."

Violence is practically non-existent in some of these systems (Norway is a leading example).  Now, I don't think you can just implement that in a vacuum.  For example, many of those countries also have really solid mental health systems (where in the US those people often end up in prisons which aren't well-equipped to deal with them).

The Bureau of Indian Affairs created a “court of Indian offenses,” which was designed to prosecute Indians for practicing native customs. In recent times, the BIA was forced to settle a lawsuit in the billions of dollars for essentially stealing Indian lands and monies held in trust. The government agency in charge of the welfare of Native Americans turned out to be one of the largest abusers of their 'charges' and was supported for decades in these efforts by many successive governments.  Eventually, post WWII (in recognition of the proportionally high service of Native Americans), the posture of the government became somewhat reconciliatory. Policies were still damaging to native culture, but the intent was less destructive on the government's part. For example, the Termination and Relocation policy sought to alleviate poverty on reservations by 'encouraging' Native Americans to move to the cities, and ultimately dissolve the reservations. It is hard to see how the dissolution of one's lands can be seen as helpful by anyone.   It's a long, sad affair."

Instead, they're treating this as an ethics and integrity issue. Where were those ethics and integrity while they were weighing whether or not to out a (probably) closeted gay man who had done nothing to anyone except be wealthy and have connections?  I read the article on Thursday and was disgusted by it. These same editors chose to protect the anonymity of a blackmailing escort and not that of the person who -- let's be honest here -- was the victim in this scenario.  If you were able to read the story, Geithner was upfront and communicative throughout, and even ended up paying the guy for the costs of service even though they never met up. Plus, who knows what his wife was/was not aware of? Meanwhile, the escort was clearly putting this guy in an uncomfortable place by asking him (a private executive) to help out with a small-time landlord-tenant dispute.  Utterly ridiculous.  These guys should have been fired before they even resigned, because the decision to press publish on that story represents a gross lack of editorial judgment.

It's enforced by the treasury department, specifically the IRS. The 'penalty' is based off your income, like a tax.  Just because the legislature called it a penalty doesn't mean it is.

The ""plain language"" was a drafting error resulting from the late addition of the federal exchanges provision and a failure to update all of the language to accommodate that update. It is not beyond the pale of normal statutory interpretation to view the text in light of its drafting history and the intent of congress. It was hardly a ""Gotcha"" rule, as no one who voted on it was under the impression that the federal exchanges couldn't receive subsidies. The story that it was written to exclude federal exchanges in order to incentivize the states is a myth, with little to no evidence to support it."
news,3dyhem,exnihilonihilfit,2,Tue Jul 21 12:19:43 2015 UTC,"Whenever I was reading about the whole dust up over the language I kept just thinking about how the phrase ""the state"" is not only used to describe a state in terms of ""Alabama, Connecticut, etc..."" but also a term used to describe the overarching highest government of a country as a whole, as in ""Secretary of State"" or ""enemy of the state"", or ""state sponsored terrorism"".  Especially since the wording if I recall correctly said ""the state"" and not ""individual states"" or ""by the states"".  The usage of the term in the singular seemed to make it obvious to me they were talking about the federal government using ""state"" as a sort of pronoun.  In any case, the notion that we would just uproot and blow out an entire law and the system in place to execute it merely because of a perceived typo (not even one that was undeniable) is just flat childish.  It astounds me that grown ass adults who purport to be legal and policy experts and ""our leaders"" would stoop to such immaturity.

news,3dyhem,therealterry,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:03:58 2015 UTC,"I was under that impression too based on some news reports, but after looking at the statutory language myself, reading the actual opinion, and reading a pretty in depth article on it that I came across some how, I agree with the challengers and those who are against the opinion that those reports are misleading.   The language in question is found in a sentence worded to the effect of ""if a state has an exchange, then subsidies will be available for those who obtain insurance from the exchange established by the state."" (this is not an exact quote, but simplified). The structure of the sentence makes it pretty clear that the use of the term ""the state"" was referring back to the original use the term ""a state,"" and there's really no mistaking that ""a state"" means one of the several states and not the federal government. Furthermore, immediately after the words ""the state,"" there was a citation to the provision about state exchanges, the provision providing for federal exchanges was located in a completely different section of the statute that was added later and was not cited. The issue is that at the time the provision regarding subsidies was added, there was no provision for federal exchanges. At the time, the drafters assumed that all states would agree to create exchanges, but once they realized that certain states would refuse to create exchanges in an effort to undermine the law, they went back and added provisions so that the federal government could create exchanges for states that refused to do so. Unfortunately, they did not update all of the provisions in order to remove any inconsistencies that failed to mention the new federal exchanges.  That being said, this is pretty clearly a drafting error. There is very little evidence that anyone thought that federal exchanges couldn't receive subsidies, and as soon as it was adopted, the DHHS issued a regulation clarifying that subsidies would be available on the federal exchanges. The challengers argued that DHHS's interpretation conflicted with the unambiguous statutory language. SCOTUS held not only did it not conflict with the statutory language, but the statutory language is incorrect.  All that being said, the challengers' case was not completely without merit. The plain language was actually on their side, and at one point, someone who supported the bill once said in a committee meeting that he thought they left the federal exchanges out in order to incentivize the states to create exchanges, because otherwise their residents wouldn't get insurance. If I recall correctly, the guy who said it wasn't a drafter, and from what I understand he wasn't certain and ultimately admitted that he jumped to a conclusion because he couldn't think of any other reason not to subsidize the federal exchanges but he couldn't see any other way to read the statute. No one else who read or voted on the statute suggested that that was one of the statutory objectives, in fact, almost everyone said the opposite. Most of the reviewers, it is assumed, just didn't take a look back at the subsidy provisions after the provisions for federal exchanges were added."

The whole point of lifetime appointments is to prevent douchenozzles like Ted Cruz from stacking the USSC and causing wild swings in policy and law that the justice system can't keep up with.  Ideally, the uSSC should represent a range of political views based on their appoinments, along with being individuals with credentials. And this helps to ensure that, regardless of whether or not there are social popular trends, the people making the decisions will do so representing a wider spectrum of viewpoints.   After all, as much as the conservatives bitch about the liberals, and as much as the liberals bitch about the conservatives, and as much as all the various movements out there want things to be a certain way, having an entity which is there to ultimately decide cases and caselaw with a wider swatch of viewpoints ensures that no single minority viewpoint, or even majority viewpoint, is made cannon.   Personally, as political as the USSC is, I'd rather have the opinions continue to show a range and be refreshed slowly over time vs. flashpoint-changing every X years (And also remove any potential incentive for votebuying and political crap in the process) than remove people when I think they're past their expiration dates.

There was nothing controversial about the supreme courts interpretations. Obama care was about the exchanged the words in question were ""established by the state"". The state is ambiguous though it can mean a country as a whole or specifically the states of the U.S. But if we go by the intended purpose of the bill the architechs of obamacare ACA didn't intend for a meaning like that which could kill the entire bill in four words. So the proper interpretation is fairly obvious they refered to the United States the individual states can not get out of the exchanges to kill obamacare. It was a pretty petty thing to fight over really.  Edit: I typed this too fast I forgot to include that term limits are not nessecary and will impede this branch of our government which is meant to be impartial. None of these cases were controversial based off of legal logic and previously held decisions. 14th amendment has redefined marriage before the obamacare 4 word wonder was an obvious misinterpretation by conservatives in a hax attempt to kill the bill. The supreme court is in no way abusing their power."

If you read the speech in its entirety, instead of depending on the selective quotations, this is abundantly clear. As she describes it, he (the man you are saying she raped):  'Pushes her down on the bed; he does “that sexy maneuver where the guy pushes you on the bed, you know, like, ‘I’m taking the wheel on this one. Now I’m going to blow your mind. …’”  he penetrates her with his fingers; “his fingers poked inside me like they had lost their keys in there.”  Tries to have intercourse, though his penis is only half-willing; she describes him as “pushing aggressively into my thigh, and during this failed penetration, I looked around the room to try and distract myself or God willing, disassociate.” Even using the “made to penetrate” standard, she’s not raping him, because she’s not making him do anything; he’s the active one.  he goes down on her.  He attempts intercourse again; this time, '[o]n his fourth thrust, he gave up and fell asleep on my breast.'  At no point in Schumer’s story does she describe herself as initiating anything. Indeed, she spends much of the time thinking to herself how much she wants to leave.  'He started to go down on me. That’s ambitious, I think. Is it still considered getting head if the guy falls asleep every three seconds and moves his tongue like an elderly person eating their last oatmeal? … Is it? Yes? It is. I want to scream for myself, 'Get out of here, Amy. You are beautiful, you are smart, and worth more than this. This is not where you stay.'  If a woman initiates sex with a man who is too drunk to consent, that’s rape. But a woman lying motionless trying to dissociate while a man tries to penetrate her is not a rapist.""  Rape is a horrific crime that does happen to men.  If you care about this issue, find a way to help the cause which doesn't include throwing around baseless  false rape accusations. What you are doing only hurts real victims."

news,3e0932,CrazyInAnInsaneWorld,8,Tue Jul 21 06:53:25 2015 UTC,"The judge threw out the charges on a technicality. From this article...   There was one problem, though, with Solo's version: It wasn't entirely accurate. In fact, as the 33-year-old Solo prepares to lead the United States into Monday's opening-round match of the World Cup, her case is not over; the facts have never been aired in open court, and she has not been cleared. Rather, Solo's case in Kirkland Municipal Court was dismissed by Judge Michael Lambo on procedural grounds, and prosecutors, in a rare move that required city administrator approval, have filed an appeal with the Superior Court of Washington. Prosecutors are scheduled to file their argument by July 13, with the defense due to respond by Aug. 10. Oral arguments are scheduled for Sept. 11.   So she hasn't actually been cleared of anything, just yet. From the same article...   When Goguen asked if the argument had become physical, Solo turned away and cried. She grabbed her head at one point and said it hurt. When he asked what happened, she said her nephew ""struck her with a stick."" Goguen asked why, but Solo didn't answer. As she continued to cry, she said the teenager was a ""scary person"" and she was ""protecting herself."" When Goguen asked Solo if she had any bumps or bruises,"" she shrugged her shoulders."" He asked to examine her head but she ""adamantly declined."" Goguen wrote that he didn't notice any other signs of injuries.   So not only does she refuse to let the police catalog any evidence that may potentially support her claim that she was the victim, she then doesn't even outwardly display any injuries. Let's continue...   ""It was apparent to me [Solo] was unwilling to go into detail of exactly what happened,"" Goguen wrote. She continued to deny pushing or hitting her sister or nephew, and when asked why they were telling other officers she had done just that, Solo replied, ""I did not hit anyone. He hit me with a stick.""   So she denies taking any hostile action at all. According to her, she was the victim, and she didn't do nothing to Obert and her son, and instead, claims Obert's son was the aggressor. Let's keep reading...   Obert's son, according to Officer Elizabeth Voss, had redness around his nose and left jawbone and a ""bleeding cut on the bottom of his left ear, just above the earlobe."" His T-shirt was ripped and his arms were ""bright red and had scratch marks.""  Obert ""had bruising on the left side of her face,"" and ""a large scratch mark on the right side of her neck,"" according to Officer Chuck Pierce. He wrote that Obert's clothing was in ""disarray"" and it ""appeared she could not stand.""  Goguen then met with officers Voss and Pierce to discuss the various stories. Based upon Obert's and her son's ""obvious"" injuries, they believed there was probable cause to arrest Solo, according to documents. When Goguen returned to Solo, advised her that she was under arrest and placed her in handcuffs, she became upset and questioned why she was being arrested. She again insisted she had hit no one.   So the very folks who called the police, display injuries, whereas Solo displayed none, and even sought to keep police from inspecting her for injuries, even as she claimed she was the attack victim. By contrast, the evidence lines up with the accounts given by Obert and her son, that they restrained her when she came after them, then attacked again after they let her up. The officers even go so far as to say that they have ""no doubt in their mind she was the primary aggressor"".   Shortly before 3 a.m. Russell wrote that he and Goguen transported Solo to another jail facility, where she would spend the next two-plus days. There, according to Russell's report, Solo continued with her insults of Goguen and Russell ""to incite some reaction"" and then turned her attention to the jail staff. As she was being told to walk to the search area, Solo pulled away from an officer, leading her to be taken to a holding cell. There, Russell wrote, ""officers took [Solo] to the ground to gain her compliance."" It was at this point, Russell wrote, that Solo told one of the officers that if she weren't in handcuffs, ""I'd kick your ass.""   So she was drunk and beligerent. Elsewhere in the article, it mentions she had been drinking heavily, to the point the officers could smell the alcohol on her breath. Furthermore, her attorney claims this...   Maybrown, Solo's lawyer, in response to questions about his client's behavior, wrote: ""Any of us would be upset at being wrongly arrested."" He stated that had the case gone to trial, he would have presented a ""renowned concussion expert"" who had concluded her behavior was consistent with someone who suffered a ""significant head injury"" rather than being drunk. ""Hope was not intoxicated; she was concussed.""   Well, first of all, yes, people would be upset about being falsely arrested, but nobody in their right and sober mindset would be slurring their speech, and being belligerent with the prison guards, to the point of instating threats against them. You're in enough trouble already with the false charges, why give them even more to use against you? And it's regrettable that she wouldn't let them inspect her for injuries, because now the idea she was concussed appears to come purely out of self-interest, rather than having any objective evidence to back the claim up. Furthermore, there are no reports of Solo being injured when she returned to her soccer career. Which, given the drama surrounding concussions recently, is a big thing for the soccer team to not report, and suggests she wasn't actually concussed.  Every piece of objective evidence we have points to Solo being guilty. Furthermore, since the case was thrown on a technicality, Solo could still be charged in the future, as Double Jeopardy does not yet come into play. This is hardly a case of the prosecution not having the evidence to back up their claim. If anything, assuming this goes to trial, it appears that Solo will, indeed be found guilty, given the evidence on-hand."

My point being, is that nobody ever really seems to care about ""Innocent until proven guilty"" unless it's a woman accused of a crime. Case in point: Any of the recent cases involving NFL players, or Paul Nungesser. Even after being cleared by BOTH the college and the police, in Nungesser's case, the media still smeared him as a rapist. Nobody cared, socially speaking, that he hadn't been found guilty, then. Now all of a sudden, a woman is accused of domestic violence, and people come crawling out of the woodwork practically crying ""Innocent until proven guilty! Innocent until proven guilty!""  Kind of funny how one-sided that dynamic is, ain't it? It's almost as if, once a woman faces a problem, everyone rushes to fix it. While I agree with you, ""Innocent until proven guilty"" would be a great standard, it's sickening that people only seem to care about it when women are accused, and discard any notion of it when it's a man accused.  If you apply the standards equally across the board, then feel free to disregard my comments.

The fossil fuel establishment is the modern-day Nazi party and people who have buried their head in the sand are appeasers. When historians look through the present, they will see elected officials like the republican party of the US, the Koch brothers, George W Bush, as people who more or less caused this to happen. People like Elon Musk, Jerry Brown, the Pope, Al Gore, universities that divested from fossil fuel companies, the few republicans that break from their party and say it's a problem, will be the people who planned operation Valkyrie, the Americans during D-Day and the Russians at Stalingrad.  The tens of millions of people, possibly billions if droughts are that bad, who die will be the tens of millions of people who died during WWII.  One way I could see this problem being solved is if the risks of climate change, which include millions of dark-skinned people spilling over the border into the US when drought forces them to leave, were presented to the Republican party, sadly.  The ultimate irony is that even the wealthiest people will be affected. The CEOs of oil companies could most certainly be affected. If it gets really bad, possibly French Revolution style. I really think it's possible with what scientists are projecting, the availability of information these days, and the limitations of security even with our technology.

Getting anything done right now requires burning fossil fuels. Water shortages are solved with desalination which requires burning fossil fuels which causes climate change.

However at this point we would be incentivizing abortion because let's face people aren't going to stop having sex.   Male contraception needs to be more of a thing. Female contraception so far is just garbage. Further development into mandatory semi permanent male contraception for young adults and/or those in the poverty line would really go to a long way to correct a lot of these issues.  No idea how to implement this in the third world but the first world could seize humanitarian efforts to countries that don't comply with population control standards.  We've enabled the third world to a population boom in many ways by shifting manufacturing off-shore and with huge amounts of humanitarian aid.  Folks who think we should have crazy, borderline fanatic population control measures also seem to be those who support humanitarian efforts abroad and sweeping all encompassing social services at home. You can't have it both ways.  Natural population control is survival of the fittest, Darwinian stuff. So now that we are at this point, what's the answer? How as a world population do we devalue large families but still have enough 'man-power' to keep our way of life.  Supply and demand are huge factor to our current way of life we enjoy.

Excerpt from ""Healer"" (1979) ==> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Paul_Wilson#Career    Dalt glanced across the park and noticed that there were a number of people on the white monument. Letters, illegible from this distance, had been illuminated on a dark patch near the monument's apex. As he watched, a cylinder arose from the platform and extended what appeared to be a stiff, single-jointed appendage with some sort of thong streaming from the end. A shirtless young man was brought to the platform. There was some milling around, and then his arms were fastened to an abutment.  The one-armed machine began to whip him across his bare back.  Chapter VII  ""Finish that drink before we talk,"" El said.  ""There's really not much to talk about,"" Dalt replied curtly. ""I'm getting off this planet as soon as I can find a ship to take me.""  They drank in silence amid the clatter and chatter of a busy restaurant, and Dalt's thoughts were irresistibly drawn back to that incredible scene in the park just as he himself had been irresistibly drawn across the grass for a closer look, to try to find some evidence that it was all a hoax. But the man's cries of pain and the rising welts on his back left little doubt. No one else in the park appeared to take much notice; some paused to look at the sign that overhung the tableau, then idly strolled on.  Dalt, too, looked at the sign:  A. Nelso  Accused of theft of private ground car on 9-6.  Convicted of same on 9-20. Appeal denied.  Sentence of public punishment to 0.6 Gomler units to be administered on 9-24.  The whipping stopped and the sign flashed blank. The man was released from the pillory and helped from the platform. Dalt was trying to decide whether the tears in the youth's eyes were from pain or humiliation, when a young, auburn-haired woman of about thirty years ascended the platform. She wore a harness of sorts that covered her breasts and abdomen but left her back exposed. As attendants locked her to the pillory, the sign came to life again:  H. T. Hammet Accused of theft of miniature vid set from retail store on 9-8. Convicted of same on 9-22. Appeal denied. Sentence of public punishment to 0.2 Gomler units to be administered on 9-24.  The cylinder raised the lash, swung its arm, and the woman winced and bit her lower lip. Dalt spun and lurched away.  (""Barbaric!"") Pard said when they had crossed the street and were back among the storefronts.  What? No remarks about being squeamish?  (""Holograms of deviant sexual behavior posed for by volunteers are quite different from public floggings. How can supposedly civilized people allow such stone-age brutality to go on?"")  I don't know and I don't care. Tolive has just lost a prospective citizen.  A familiar figure suddenly caught his eye. It was El.  ""Hi!"" she said breathlessly. ""Sorry I'm late.""  ""I didn't notice,"" he said coldly. ""I was too busy watching that atavistic display in the park.""  She grabbed his arm. ""C'mon. Let's eat.""  ""I assure you, I'm not hungry.""  ""Then at least have a drink and we'll talk."" She tugged on his arm.  (""Might as well, Steve. I'd be interested in hearing how she's going to defend public floggings."")  Noting a restaurant sign behind him, Dalt shrugged and started for the entrance.  ""Not there,"" El said. ""They lost their sticker last week. We'll go to Logue's—it's about a quarter-way around.""  El made no attempt at conversation as she led him around to the restaurant she wanted. During the walk, Dalt allowed his eyes to stray toward the park only once. Not a word was spoken between them until they were seated inside with drinks before them. Logue's modest furnishings and low lighting were offset by its extravagant employment of human waiters.  It was not until the waiter had brought Dalt his second drink that he finally broke the silence.  ""You wanted me to see those floggings, didn't you,"" he said, holding her eyes. ""That's what you meant about catching 'a little of the flavor of Tolive.' Well, I caught more than a little, I caught a bellyful!""  Maddeningly patient, El sipped her drink, then said, ""Just what did you see that so offended you?""  ""I saw floggings!"" Dalt sputtered. ""Public floggings! The kind of thing that had been abandoned on Earth long before we ever left there!""  ""Would you prefer private floggings?"" There was a trace of a smile about her mouth.  ""I would prefer no floggings, and I don't appreciate your sense of humor. I got a look at that woman's face and she was in pain.""  ""You seem especially concerned over the fact that women as well as men were pilloried today.""  ""Maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but I don't like to see a woman beaten like that.""  El eyed him over her glass. ""There are a lot of old-fashioned things about you ... do you know that you lapse into an archaic speech pattern when you get excited?"" She shook herself abruptly. ""But we'll go into that another time; right now I want to explore your high-handed attitude toward women.""  ""Please—"" Dalt began, but she pushed on.  ""I happen to be as mature, as responsible, as rational as any man I know, and if I commit a crime, I want you to assume that I knew exactly what I was doing. I'd take anything less as a personal insult.""  ""Okay. Let's not get sidetracked on that age-old debate. The subject at hand is corporal punishment in a public place.""  ""Was the flogging being done for sport?"" El asked. ""Were people standing around and cheering?""  ""The answers are 'no' and 'no'—and don't start playing Socrates with me.""  El persisted. ""Did the lash slice deeply into their backs? Were they bleeding? Were they screaming with pain?""  ""Stop the questions! No, they weren't screaming and they weren't bleeding, but they were most definitely in pain!""  ""Why was this being done to these people?""   Why?  Because they persistently denied climate change despite overwhelming evidence as to it's validity."

You do have to get the verbal and explicit consent of the person in order to do anything, which is only implied if the person is unconscious.  These are called Good Samaritan Laws and are common in the US and Canada.  The catch to this is that people are not generally obligated to begin first aid, but once care is begun they then assume a responsibility to continue care until more capable help arrives.  Doing a little and then leaving before paramedics arrive assumes liability for any harm caused in the interim.  The person also has to act in accordance with their training - if they do something wrong when they should have known better, that's on them.  However, your boss is right that you cannot administer any kind of medication.  You can assist the person in locating and gaining access to their own medication, but you cannot actually administer it to them.  They have to do that themselves.  Bandaging a wound that is bleeding out does not count as ""administering medication"".  Edit: a word"

One night, I walked out to the front counter, and there was a man with a young boy had a pretty nasty cut on his hand.  He asked if I could get him some bandage for his son, and I rushed back to my boss to ask about the first aid kit. When I told him what it was for, he sadly shook his head and told me we couldn't offer them for liability reasons.  I was stunned. I told him I couldn't go back out there and tell a father that we couldn't offer a bandage for his bleeding son. So my boss went out there and did it for me, and apologized to the man for it. He really was sorry, but it had apparently been driven into our managers that we weren't allowed to help in any medical situation other than calling for an ambulance.  It's one of the earliest memories I have in which I felt more than a little disgusted with our society.

The catch there is that you probably aren't trained in how to use that first-aid kit, and if you are then the company can't verify that training.  If you act outside your training then you can be held liable, except in emergency situations (which a cut on the hand is not) when you act reasonably to preserve life.  The company is probably concerned about employees doing more than just handing the dad a bandage, so they make a blanket rule against doing anything.  It's a great example of how a profit-driven entity can make perfectly rational and unethical decisions."

Is there a process in place to make sure that the first aid kits are regularly changed?  Are the employees trained on how to prevent contamination, which wouldn't be that hard in a food service setting?  The company doesn't care about helping people.  The company cares about money.  All those things would cost money, and allowing any aid without doing those things could potentially cost money.  From the company's perspective, there is no upside to helping anyone or even trying to do so.  It makes complete sense.  It's also pretty abhorrent from an ethical perspective."

FWIW, businesses have the highest duty of care to customers (as invitees on the premises). Every jurisdiction I practice in, and that I know of, recognizes that this extends this duty to protecting invitees from criminal activity of third parties.  However, all jurisidictions to my knowledge require that such criminal activity be foreseeable.    ""The concept of “foreseeability” may be troubling to some business owners. For example, it could be argued that a business that operates in a high crime area will always have a foreseeable risk of robbery just by virtue of the business’s location. In that case, what factors should a business owner consider? Factors that may contribute to the “foreseeability” of a third-party criminal act are the presence of crimes at the business previously, similar businesses being robbed in the area (i.e., a string of jewelry store robberies), or news stories detailing a crime spree in the vicinity. Whether something is foreseeable is generally determined by what an ordinary person in similar circumstances may expect to happen."" Source   Unfortunately for Target and other businesses in their situation, this is naturally a fact intensive situation and not one of law. Thus, dispositive motions such as motions to dismiss or motions for summary judgment will likely fail if the Plaintiff can successfully interject a question of fact that must be decided by a jury.   I'm sure Target's lawyers thought, ""Oh look, a co-defendant!"" after reviewing this case. Pennsylvania has comparative fault and several, but not joint, liability against defendants for actions sounding in negligence. Source. This means that in a jury would find 1% against our protagonist hero, that would diminish liability (and need to pay) for Target. Now, if an intentional tort was alleged that would be different in regards to who would have to pay first.  I will note that not adding the bystander as a third party defendant would probably have been negligent on the part of Target's attorneys.   TL;DR: Target can be liable. The bystander can be liable.

Our State's law is similar but a business having a duty to protect a patron is the exception not the rule. Generally the business has no duty to protect a patron from third party crimes. They only have such a duty if they know or have reason to know a patron could be a victim of crime (i.e. the foreseeability that you mentioned)  In our state, winning against a business for the actions of a third party criminal is not easy. Heck, we recently had a case where the business was not liable for the assault and battery of its own employees inside the store.   Who knows what happened in the Target case.

If it helps anyone picture the scene, most Targets have a layout like this where the entrance, bathroom and checkout are all next to each other.    Pittsburgh police said 41-year-old Leon Raymond Walls entered the store on Penn Avenue just after 5:30 p.m. Monday and headed toward the restroom. Shortly after, two men came in looking for him, and one of them followed him into the restroom, where he was chased out by the knife-wielding Walls, police said.  According to the criminal complaint, the incident began when Walls stabbed a man named Jobe Wright near a construction site on nearby Highland Avenue. Police said Walls ran down the street toward Penn Circle and into Target, followed by Wright, his friend Michael Turner, and Tyrique Walker, who called 911 to report their location, and Roland Smith, who grabbed a baseball bat to help Wright.  Once they were all inside the store, ""Walls saw Walker and attempted to stab him with a large swing at his neck area,"" the complaint said. ""Walls, missing his target, then moved towards the checkout area at the Target store where he began trying to stab additional victims who were in the store. Walls then grabbed Allison Meadows and held her against her will at knifepoint in one of the checkout lanes to use her as a shield. Victims Hosea Davis, Mike Turner, Jobe Wright and Roland Smith attempted to subdue Walls and to free Meadows when they saw him poke the knife into Meadows' back.""

news,3e0btg,liatris,6,Tue Jul 21 00:54:18 2015 UTC,So change the Constitution
news,3e0btg,stillclub,3,Tue Jul 21 01:10:37 2015 UTC,"The Fourteenth Amendment states that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.”  I think there is a question of jurisdiction.   http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2010/08/30/14th-amendment-doesnt-make-illegal-aliens-children-citizens   Many today assume the second half of the citizenship clause (""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"") merely refers to the day-to-day laws to which we are all subject. But the original understanding referred to political allegiance. Being subject to U.S. jurisdiction meant, as then-Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Lyman Trumbull stated, ""not owing allegiance to anybody else [but] subject to the complete jurisdiction of the United States."" The author of the provision, Sen. Jacob Merritt Howard of Michigan, pointed out that the jurisdiction language ""will not, of course, include foreigners.""  It was in 1898 (in United States v. Wong Kim Ark) that the Supreme Court expanded the constitutional mandate, holding that the children of legal, permanent residents were automatically citizens. While the decision could be (and is often) read more broadly, the court has never held that the clause confers automatic citizenship on the children of temporary visitors, much less of illegal residents.  The broader reading is a constitutional misreading. Not only does it grant citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants, it also gives full due-process rights to the likes of Taliban fighter Yasir Hamdi (born in the United States of visiting Saudi parents and captured fighting U.S. soldiers 20 years later in Afghanistan).  But it is the principle of the matter that is most problematic. The broad claim of automatic birthright citizenship traces its roots more to the feudal concept of perpetual allegiance of subjects to kings, rather than equal rights and the consent of the governed. It violates bedrock American principles and undermines the rule of law.  While the Constitution defines the basic conditions, the decision whether and how far to offer citizenship beyond that (i.e., who is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States) is a policy judgment historically left to Congress. It could, for instance, extend birthright citizenship to legal permanent residents (consistent with Wong Kim Ark) but exclude, in the future, the children of illegal or temporary residents.  Nobody is talking about repealing the 14th Amendment, or taking away anyone's citizenship. Nor must we amend the Constitution. But Congress needs to clarify the extent of birthright citizenship. It should do so as part of a clear and meaningful policy concerning immigration, naturalization, and citizenship that is consistent with the core principles and highest ideals of the United States."

Original post; I've told this story before, but I feel it bares repeating in case anyone doubts what you've said.   My favorite teacher in middle school was accused of having child porn. (I was in college by then.) he was arrested at school, and it was reported that the child porn was on his work computer. The story was all over the news and he was fired.   Charges were never filed. There was one picture, of him and his family doing relief work in a 3rd world county, and a little kid was playing with him self in the background.   The news never said anything about him not being charged, and to this day of you google his name you'll find his mug shot and stories about his arrest. He was never able to work in schools again.   He killed him self 3 years later. He lost what he loved most in this world, teaching kids music... And most of his students who once loved him think of him as a pedophile. This shit is fucked up and this man deserves a public apology. And so does my teacher, but he'll never get one.   Edit: I hate it when people do this, but I'm actually happy this is my most up voted comment.   A few things: since he's dead I'm pretty sure this doesn't violate rules.

He probably raped because he is part of a religion that teaches belittlement and ownership of women AND he is a bad person. Dont get me wrong, this has been a problem with many religions, namely Christianity as a polar example of Islam, but for the vast most part Christian nations have evolved with the times and have modernized to reject religious dogma and theocracy in totality. For instance, in the UK a huge problem is Sharia courts bypassing the law and handling (horribly) cases of domestic violence. The reason for this is that the Islamic element is resistant to modernization in terms of, at the very least, rejecting the notion that their women are property and not individual agents that are protected separate from men under law. You see the same thing in France, and heck even sometimes here in the US.   The first thing does not negate the second thing I mentioned above. The fact that he is a bad person is probably highly influenced by the fact that he is steeped in a religious culture wherein this behavior would generally be ignored if he were in a more Islamic law accommodating country."

If intelligence exists, but had already been wiped out by natural means or otherwise, their signature may still be out there. For example, our radio signals have only been traveling for roughly 100 years, meaning our ""bubble"" of radio waves in all directions is roughly 200 light years across. There is a whole lot of our galaxy that hasn't heard us, yet. If intelligent life only exists in this galaxy but on the other side, it's reasonable to assume it hasn't reached us yet but if they've existed longer than us, it's possible that their signal is approaching us and unless we at least make an attempt to listen, we could miss it, hence private money going into the search is arguably better than you or I paying for it with tax dollars."

On AM are quite a few (more than 10% I'd say) single or open relationship users. Remove the sex workers, the fakes, the bots, and AM's own fake visitors and that's not a bad number. I have been on about a dozen dates since I signed up, had sex with a few of them and a relationship with two. All of the above are open relationship or single women, by the way.

Forget the fact that it's a ""cheating website"", at it's most simplest point this is personal information being accessed and made public.  If this were a website like Brazzers that was hacked, and a list of user's real names and their viewing habits were made public for the world to see, I'd like to believe that the majority of Reddit would not be okay with this type of hack. They'd probably be angry at the hackers, but also at Brazzers for not having adequate security.  However, when it's a site like Ashley Madison, the ""victims"" are less sympathetic than average porn viewers and thus ... people are against them.  You don't have to be okay with cheating, but are you okay with personal bank and credit card information being illegally accessed and made public? I mean, that information will be released too.  What you need to realize too is that some couples are okay with swinging, they have an open relationship.

I'm sure most of us know someone who secretly posts NSFW content on here.   lol I'm sure reddit would have a field day. Really bad example.  What you are failing to get: Lots of people despise cheaters, even cheaters themselves. People love their privacy and rights but they rarely have any problem with people getting exposed if the ""victims"" were caught in the act.  People hate government snooping, but if that snooping led to a preemptive discovery of a terrorist act, they wouldn't feel bad for the people that were exposed. The ideas are not mutually exclusive. People hate wars but wars happen, even people that hate wars are not sad when the bad guys lose in a war. You can hate war and at the same time be happy that you or someone you root for is the victor when war inevitably happens.  Similarly, you can hate the idea of not having privacy, but people's privacy is invaded all the time; so when it inevitably happens, if it exposes cheaters (or any other people you despise), people can feel good about it. You can't really choose how you feel about it.  If an evil dictator dies in a traffic accident, you can feel happy about it. You don't have to support reckless driving in the process.  If I knew if someone I knew was being cheated on, and if he/she was in the dark about it, I would inform that person about what I know. I feel that is my moral obligation. If this happens in mass scale, it doesn't really change my stance on the issue. Yeah, I don't like hackers hacking private information and holding it for ransom, but I'm happy if even one person who got cheated on learns the truth and gains the ability to make an informed decision about how they are willing to spend the next decades of their lives."

news,3e0meh,anothercarguy,10,Tue Jul 21 01:17:35 2015 UTC,"By Molly Hennessy-Fiske and Michael Muskal   Officials called Monday for a thorough investigation into the death of Sandra Bland, whose body was found in her Texas cell a week ago, and released three hours of videotape of the jail corridor.   The camera was motion-operated, officials said, and there was no movement in the hallway for more than 90 minutes before Bland, 28, was found dead.   A second video taken from the camera on the dashboard of the police car involved in Bland’s arrest is expected to be released Tuesday, Waller County Dist. Atty. Elton Mathis said.  “This investigation is still being treated like a murder investigation,” Mathis told reporters. “There are many questions being raised in Waller County, the state of Texas, the country and around the world. It needs a thorough review. It will go to a grand jury."" Black Twitter demands answers: What happened to #SandraBland?  Bland was found dead on July 13, days after she was arrested during a traffic stop on July 10. Capt. Brian Cantrell of the Waller County Sheriff's Department told reporters that Bland was found with her feet on the ground, though the death had been described earlier as a hanging.  Bland died ""as a result of self-inflicted asphyxiation"" from a plastic garbage bag used by the jail for trash collection. ""Her feet were on the ground,"" he said.  ""She could not breathe. That can happen whether standing or sitting down,"" Cantrell said.  ""The death of Miss Bland was a tragic incident, not one of criminal intent or a criminal act,"" he said.  Mathis said the dashboard video shows a very combative Bland. “It was not a model traffic stop and it was not a model person that was stopped,” he said.  Under questioning from reporters, Mathis said Bland did not comply with an officer's directions.  Reactions on Twitter were overwhelmingly skeptical of the official account.  Many focused on the conduct of the officer who stopped her, asking why Bland had been ordered to get out of her car while smoking a cigarette. Others demanded that all footage be publicly released -- the dash cam video, internal jail footage, audio of her last phone call, any data that exists, because they did not trust the media to sift through it for them.  Bland's death is the latest in a series of cases involving authorities and deadly confrontations with African Americans, including Eric Garner in New York City last July, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., last August, and Walter Scott in North Carolina and Freddie Gray in Baltimore, both in April.  Earlier Monday, a coalition of civil rights activists called for an independent investigation.  “This is not a race war. This is a war on black lives,” said the Rev. Hannah Bonner, pastor of justice ministries at St. John’s United Methodist Church in Houston, a white minister who has been holding a vigil outside the sheriff’s office since Bland’s death. The group of about two dozen clergy and other supporters called for the Justice Department to investigate the death.  Activists questioned the validity of the video, saying it could be altered and time stamps changed. (Because of its length, The Times has yet to watch the full video.)   “This was not a suicide. This behind me was murder. All of America knows something is rotten,” the Rev. Jamal Bryant said at a news conference in front of the Waller County Sheriff’s Department and jail.  Bland was a frequent activist on social media. She prepared and posted more than two dozen Facebook videos, many dealing with the deaths of blacks at the hands of police.  “We’re doing as much as we can,” she said in April. “And we can’t help but get pissed off when we see situations where it’s clear that the black life doesn’t matter. Show me in American history where all lives have mattered. Show me liberty and justice for all like that -- Pledge of Allegiance we love to say.”  Bland was stopped for a traffic violation in Waller County, about an hour from Houston. Bland, of Naperville, Ill., was in the area to interview for a job at Prairie View A&M University, a historically black college that she graduated from in 2009.   According to the Texas Department of Public Safety, Bland failed to signal that she was changing lanes so a trooper pulled her over. The trooper was going to give her a written warning but Bland became argumentative and uncooperative, officials say.  Officials have said Bland kicked the officer. A video shot by a passerby purports to show the arrest and the trooper restraining Bland on the ground.  Bland was taken into custody for assault on a public servant, officials said. An emergency medical services unit responded, but Bland refused treatment and was taken to the county jail, according to the Department of Public Safety.  “Her manner of death is classified as suicide,” Tricia Bentley, spokeswoman for Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, which handled the autopsy, told the Los Angeles Times on Monday. “The cause of death is hanging.”  The trooper, who has not been publicly identified, has been placed on administrative duty pending an investigation, officials said.  “In the preliminary review of the traffic stop that occurred in Prairie View on July 10, 2015, involving Sandra Bland, we have identified violations of the department’s procedures regarding traffic stops and the department’s courtesy policy,” the department said last week in a statement.  Family members and friends insist Bland was looking forward to a new job at her former school and that she gave no indication she would kill herself.  In a widely reported video posted to her Facebook page, Bland said she was suffering from “a little bit of depression, as well as PTSD,” or post-traumatic stress disorder. Friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley of Prairie View has told reporters that he believes Bland was just venting after a bad day.  Bryant, the pastor, called on U.S. Atty. Gen. Loretta Lynch to start an independent investigation and “take this out of the hands of the police.”  Bland’s body was expected to be released Monday and the family plans to have an independent expert perform a second autopsy, according to the Rev. David Madison of Greater Ward AME Church in Houston and president of the AME Ministers Alliance.  Madison said Bland’s body would be taken back to Illinois for a funeral, which had yet to be scheduled. A memorial is planned at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Prairie View A&M University.  Bland's supporters toted signs outside the jail Monday that featured quotes from her videos, pictures of Bland and lingering questions, including: “What happened to Sandra Bland?” and “They stopped her for what?”  Residents not far from College Station, the even larger town that’s home to Texas A&M, complained of police profiling.  “As far as I’m concerned, we have a murderer in there with a badge,” said Joy Harris, 62, a registered nurse from College Station carrying a sign and wearing a neon orange shirt that said, “Sandra Bland was murdered.”  “Police officers should know what the law is and abide by that. People shouldn’t lose their lives over this,” said Harris, who is African American.  But that opinion was not universal in Hempstead, a small town with a cluster of beauty salons and restaurants, a Wal-Mart, feed store, farmers market, and a Brookshire Brothers grocery store.  “There’s no racial tension here,” said Luther Jones as he played dominoes with three other African American residents at Bragg’s Hollywood Palace barbecue on the city’s main street.  Jones, 47, is self-employed, grew up here and said his main question is not how Bland died at the jail but why the trooper stopped her.  “We don’t really hear much about abuse at the jail. If something was going on over there, we would know,” Jones said, adding, “The district attorney, I believe he’ll find out what’s going on.”  Jimmy Economou, 50, also grew up in Hempstead and was less trusting of local authorities. “We might be a small town, Hempstead, but we're on the map – there have been problems before” at the jail, Economou, who is unemployed, said as he stood outside the courthouse before a briefing by local authorities. lRelated Just how black is Bernie Sanders?  He was glad to hear that the FBI and Texas Rangers are investigating.  “If anybody did anything, they’re going to find it. They’ll get to the bottom of it. Local authorities won’t,” Economou said.  Hennessy-Fiske reported from Texas and Muskal from Los Angeles. Staff writer Dexter Thomas in Los Angeles contributed to this report."

If the conversation is that our police forces are corrupted by racism, that is important to talk about, it seems.

Did not have an I-Pass cause we thought $35 in change should be sufficient to get around for 3 days (was not enough).  Passed one of these tolls with no place to pay and not knowing that there was an online option a month later back in Toronto the Rental company deducts $90 from my credit card citing that we missed a toll booth. The break down was some ludacris administrative and other random fees the actual cost of the toll was $12.00. Just a warning for any travelers who plan on driving near cities with a rental. It felt like you could not go 5 miles without seeing another toll booth. Personally would never drive down again if the toll system doesn't change.

I'll try to break it down for you:   There is a story about a police officer doing a bad thing. The department releases a statement that the officer has been put on administrative leave pending an investigation. The investigation inevitably concludes there was no wrongdoing and the officer is placed back on duty.   The only thing that actually changes in the officers life and job is that he ends up on administrative leave for a little while. This is what people are making - the fact that that is the only consequence, the only change the officer sees, and it is not a punishment of any sort.  It is mocking the fact that there are no actual consequences for officers doing bad things, because the only thing that ever happens is that they are put on leave for a while, and as you so astutely pointed out administrative leave is not a punishment."

These same editors chose to protect the anonymity of a blackmailing escort and not that of the person who -- let's be honest here -- was the victim in this scenario.  If you were able to read the story, Geithner was upfront and communicative throughout, and even ended up paying the guy for the costs of service even though they never met up. Plus, who knows what his wife was/was not aware of? Meanwhile, the escort was clearly putting Geithner in an uncomfortable place by asking him (a private executive) to help out with a small-time landlord-tenant dispute.  Utterly ridiculous.  These guys should have been fired before they even resigned, because the decision to press publish on that story represents a gross lack of editorial judgment.

Just look at the initial reaction to the UVA rape story and think of how long it took for an almost unanimous media to admit that it was all a  hoax.  I wouldn't call it a conspiracy, but I think that the journalists were anxious not to go too far outside of 'accepted' opinion.  Having said that.  I think that GG's beginnings were a DISASTER and it doesn't surprise me that they got hammered by the media for instigating a witch-hunt against some dev who was accused of sleeping with journalists.  (Dunno if that's the exact story - I haven't followed it that closely.)  And I think that GG have continued making errors when it comes to the difference between valid criticism and personal attacks.  But, crucially, I really don't think they're hateful people and I think that they're slowly learning from their past mistakes.  (I understand that's little consolation for people on the butt of their past campaigns.)  Also - I think you have to realize just how much of a two-way street this is.  I've witnessed horrendously malicious attacks from the other side.  (The 'SJW' side if you will.)  That doesn't excuse everything GG has done, but I think that it's absolutely wrong to see this as a one sided problem."

I think physical evidence (broken window, bruising on the guard) would tell us which version was correct, and would be in the police report which the NYT doesn't appear to have read.   I wish the NYT would investigate the stories they report on before publishing them.   Update: from the Tulsa World article on the shooting:   Police said it appears Bird backed up the car, striking Stone, who crashed into the back window, breaking it. Stone then fired three shots at the car, according to police, including two shots as Bird drove away from Stone.   So that's attempted murder with physical evidence according to the police, and it sounds like one of the three shots was fired while Bird was attempting to ram the guard I.E. in clear self-defence.

If the car had a rear deck-lid, the guard had to be a pretty good athlete to jump up on it (aside from being a highly unusual reaction instead of jumping out of the way).   he approached the car because he had been instructed to look out for couples having sex in the parking lot.

news,3dxy02,GenericUsername802,6,Tue Jul 21 14:48:43 2015 UTC,"As a correctional officer, I have some insight into prison systems. First off, the Prison Rape Elimination Act was put in place in 2001, if my memory serves correctly, we will call it PREA from now on. PREA sets a national standard for the process of investigating sexual assaults within prisons. PREA can be inmate on inmate, inmate on staff, or staff on inmate. Staff on staff is just considered sexual assault/rape, in case you were wondering. A PREA complaint kicks off an investigation that is conducted by federal officials. It is a very time consuming process and can take quite some time to complete and prosecute.  Secondly, the camera system may not have view inside the cells. The compound I work at has 400+ cameras installed and I have only ever been able to view inside of three-four cells on the entire compound, which houses a maximum capacity of 2000 inmates. If her cellmate is the alleged offender, there is not much evidence to prove either case. They are both assigned to the cell, they both have the right to enter. If another inmate were to go in the cell, there is much more ground to place charges due to the inmate being in an unauthorized area.   Lastly, moving an inmate has much more to it than just ""hey, pack your things and go here."" Classification first has to find a cell that would place the inmate in a relatively safe dorm. In this case, I would assume that means no violent or sexual offenses to satisfy the inmates fear of sexual assault. The issue with that is nonviolent offenders have low housing classification normally, if she has a classification level that cannot permit housing with nonviolent inmates then the state DOC can't approve the transfer. The escape charge on her record, in my state at least, dictates housing in a more secure compound...a compound in which violent inmates are housed.  I hope this answered some of your questions."

Escape is not the proper way to handle the trauma experienced. You still are a convicted felon and you still have a sentence to be carried out.

Ask any parent.   but the crimes committed by one person under the custody of DOC do not mean that the state breached it's obligation to care, custody, and control of the victim.    That is precisely what it means. If the state is unwilling to meet these obligations, then they shouldn't incarcerate in the first place.  There's no excusing this.

Rape is never justified and is the most disturbing violation of someone's self, the state is not condoning it or sweeping it under the rug. Because a crime happened while in the custody of the state, does not directly conclude that the state is at fault or is responsible for the crime committed. The men incarcerated in state prisons are criminals. Devoid of respect for other human life and incapable of empathy. I see it day in and day out, the cat and mouse game they play trying to break the policies set forth by DOC. Ranging from minor disrespect to officers to lewd and lascivious acts that border sexual assault. These men need to be held responsible for their actions, as they are the party committing the crime. Are schools held responsible for shootings? No. Why are prisons different? Schools are charged with care for a time period and when a crime happens, is it not the same scenario taking place?

'nothing else they can do' is simply untrue, and I don't know why you think it is. They are literally in control of all facets of this, from the design of the facility to the times inmates are allowed to interact with eachother, to the laws that put these people in prison in the first place. If they can't solve this simple problem through some kind of active behavior and not just passivity like 'investigations' then they are unqualified to incarcerate. Hell, I can think of a solution: Don't put more than one person in a cell. Not enough space? Build better facilities. Too expensive? You're incarcerating too many people and there's a good chance your laws are unecessarily restrictive, or your social policy is creating criminals.   Because a crime happened while in the custody of the state, does not directly conclude that the state is at fault or is responsible for the crime committed.   And yet a parent is held responsibile for their children's actions.

Devoid of respect for other human life and incapable of empathy. I see it day in and day out, the cat and mouse game they play trying to break the policies set forth by DOC.   So you're de-humanizing them. Lovely. And you work for the state. No wonder you can't be objective about this. You have a vested interest in defending this behavior. I think this tendency to de-humanize inmates is exactly why the conversation went from why the person isn't wrong for trying to escape to why the state should be held blameless for this. And OF COURSE they're trying to get around the policies. They're incarcerated. The solution is not to do nothing and absolve the state of it's responsibility. The state must 'build a better mousetrap', as it were.   These men need to be held responsible for their actions, as they are the party committing the crime.   They need to be prevented from doing it in the first place! It happened twice. If protocol doesn't say to separate the two people on the first incident then the protocol is wrong. If the policy does say to separate and they didn't, then they are again unqualified to incarcerate.   Are schools held responsible for shootings? No.   YES! What do you think the idea was behind making schools a gun-free zone? It may have been a bad idea but the very fact that it was on them to try solving the problem shows that YES, schools do have some degree of responsibility for the people in their custody. Schools have been expected to introduce metal detectors, surveillance footage, counseling, training, and all sorts of other anti-violence countermeasures.

In fact its shown once Transgender people start Transitioning mental health improves quite a bit.   And finally, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. Here are a few studies, although far from all that exist on the subject:  Heylans et al., 2014: ""A difference in SCL-90 [a test of distress, anxiety, and hostility] overall psychoneurotic distress was observed at the different points of assessments (P = 0.003), with the most prominent decrease occurring after the initiation of hormone therapy (P < 0.001)...Furthermore, the SCL-90 scores resembled those of a general population after hormone therapy was initiated.""  Dhejne, et al. is much-cited by those who like to say that we have elevated mortality post-transition, and it does in fact say this...for the cohort who transitioned before 1989, in a far more hostile world and with less effective treatments. However, there was not a significant elevation of suicide or of other mortality in the post-1989 cohort.  Colizzi et al., 2013: ""At enrollment, transsexuals reported elevated CAR ['cortisol awakening response', a physiological measure of stress]; their values were out of normal. They expressed higher perceived stress and more attachment insecurity, with respect to normative sample data. When treated with hormone therapy [at followup, 1 year after beginning HRT], transsexuals reported significantly lower CAR (P < 0.001), falling within the normal range for cortisol levels. Treated transsexuals showed also lower perceived stress (P < 0.001), with levels similar to normative samples.""  Gomez-Gil et al., 2012: ""SADS, HAD-A, and HAD-Depression (HAD-D) mean scores [these are tests of depression and anxiety] were significantly higher among patients who had not begun cross-sex hormonal treatment compared with patients in hormonal treatment (F=4.362, p=.038; F=14.589, p=.001; F=9.523, p=.002 respectively). Similarly, current symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in a significantly higher percentage of untreated patients than in treated patients (61% vs. 33% and 31% vs. 8% respectively).""  Here is a broad survey conducted in the UK. Unlike the previous links, it's not peer-reviewed, but the large sample size provides some corroboration of the above results. In particular, we have: (Page 15): ""Stage of transition had a substantial impact upon life satisfaction within the sample. 70% of the participants stated that they were more satisfied with their lives since transition, compared to 2% who were less satisfied (N=671)"" (Page 50): "" Most participants who had transitioned felt that their mental health was better after doing so (74%), compared to only 5% who felt it was worse (N=353)."" (Page 55): ""For participants who had transitioned, this had led to changes in their self-harming. 63% felt that they harmed themselves more before they transitioned, with only 3% harming themselves more after transition (N=206)."" (Page 59): ""Suicidal ideation and actual attempts reduced after transition, with 63% thinking about or attempting suicide more before they transitioned and only 3% thinking about or attempting suicide more post-transition. 7% found that this increased during transition, which has implications for the support provided to those undergoing these processes (N=316).""  de Vries, et al., 2014 studied 55 trans teens from the onset of treatment in their early teenage years through a follow-up an average of 7 years later. They found no negative outcomes, no regrets, and in fact their group was slightly mentally healthier than controls.  Lawrence, 2003 surveyed post-op trans folk: ""Participants reported overwhelmingly that they were happy with their SRS results and that SRS had greatly improved the quality of their lives.

news,3dz7uk,beerpuke,47,Tue Jul 21 02:54:04 2015 UTC,"Because naive sjw's think that enforcing immigration policy is racist, unless it's being enforced against people with white skin, like Canadians. They are uneducated and unaware that every nation on Earth has immigration control, and that the immigration policy in Mexico is much harsher toward immigrants than the U.S. system, they actually do deport non-citizens. Sjw's are usually privileged naive white college kids who have no real-world basis for the strong opinions they parrot to each other. They are not living in the working class communities effected by illegal immigration."
news,3dz7uk,Strongblackfemale,8,Mon Jul 20 19:55:20 2015 UTC,"You are probably right about the SJW types opposing harsh enforcement of immigration policy, but there are also a lot of folks like me that work in agriculture and have perhaps a more nuanced perspective.  I don't normally agree with any kind of extremist, but my dad has a good saying ""A broken clock is still right twice per day.""  In this case the broken clock is a metaphor for SJW's who generally irritate me, but when they are right, they are right.    First of all the work, more specifically the part where people born in the US won't do it.  In 15 years of growing fruit trees, I had 1 non-hispanic who lasted 3 days and then quit.  The only reason I work in ag is because its a family business and I didn't have to do much field work before I was given management positions and at some point I will be the owner unless retarded immigration laws put us out of business first.  Second of all is the pay, which is low because that's what consumers demand.  To get US citizens to do the work I'd guess you'd have to pay about $20 an hour which is just over double what most hispanic workers get paid.  I can't speak for all food producers but for fruit trees, wages account for 60% of expenses.  So if you more than double our already largest expense then your price at the grocery store will be so high that people won't be able to afford it.  We will either have malnutrition with people eating much less fruits and vegetables because they can't afford them, or we will start importing much more food from other countries which has national security implications.  Compared to what we enjoy today, imported food on this scale would be more expensive, less fresh, and much less safe in terms of food pathogens and chemicals.  Third is social security, which immigrants help keep solvent because they pay in to it but they don't get benefits because they have fake social security numbers.  The degree to which social security relies on these payments to stay solvent is hard to determine because of how politically charged everything is when it comes to social security.  Regardless, social security needs all the help it can get.  Fourth is demographics: there is a massive age bulge of hispanic workers just about to hit retirement.  They have expertise and skills which are not going to be easy to replace, and for reasons both economic and political, there are not enough young replacements coming in despite what much of the conservative media says.  Even if we don't crack down on immigration, we are probably fucked.  Finding enough labor is an industry wide struggle TODAY.  So its pretty infuriating when people who don't know shit about food production want to make it even more difficult to replace this wave of hispanic immigrants who are retiring / dying.  And before you get all worked up about the use of the word ""retirement"" I can assure you this is not a glorious existence that awaits these retiring workers.  I'd guess over 90% have no savings at all and are going to burden their children with care.  They would keep working but their bodies are just breaking down and half have diabetes.  So as somebody who sees this issue from the ground, I'd like to think my perspective has value.  When we talk to fruit growers from other states where harsh anti-immigrant laws put them out of business, it is terrifying and almost surreal in a way, like this can't really be happening.  I always keep telling myself that before any really terrible laws are passed in my state or nation wide, somebody will step in and save us right?  Unfortunately no.  Nobody can save our own ignorant population from its own idiotic notions of how food ends up on its plate.  With only 1% of the population being involved in farming, there just isn't the same nation wide understanding of these issues that we had say 100 years ago.  And this causes the policies being passed in washington dc or in state capitals to be really out of touch with reality, not just on the immigration issue but on environmental regulations, taxation, trade policies, workplace safety etc..  Its almost like we need mandated yearly field trips for every child in public school to go to farms just to get a sense for what the nation's food system really looks like, because at this point unless a person belongs to the 1% that works in ag, they don't have a fucking clue."

Actually better explains how our country has a horrible policy with foreigners overall.   Take European borders. Easy to cross, lower crime rates, less intense discrimination, more unified culture, etc. Compare that to the U.S. and Mexico where you've got one country that takes a huge chunk of land from the other and follows by expelling natives from their homes and putting up a giant fence. Then makes a large selection of drugs illegal to the dismay of many of it's citizens causing them to look for them elsewhere. US then decides to blame Mexico for supplying the high demand instead of it's own citizens for demanding them, or itself for restricting supply without alternative. THEN the US gives cartel easy access to military grade weaponry and ignores all requests from Mexican govt to help with problem the US creates making Mexico one of the more dangerous countries to visit (let alone live in).   So yes, the search for better opportunities is our problem. Because until Mexico returns to a place with opportunities and safety, immigrants will always try to come over no matter how big the fence and no matter how big the guns.

We are mostly all patriotic and believe that the United States is special only because it believes all men were created equal, with ""unalienable"" rights, meaning rights that are not to be removed by a government worth keeping.  To even form the Union in the first place, the constitutional convention had to include a ""Bill Of Rights"" that the government is never allowed to infringe upon.    Do any of you know what i'm talking about?  Read the ninth amendment before you read the second amendment, and if you don't agree that these documents are current, legally binding and valid, then move along, we have nothing to agree about.    Every citizen, officer, or soldier in America was given rights to protect ourselves, our families and property.  This means we are not just permitted, but that any governments in American territory are prohibited from restricting those rights in any way.  Only through criminal action can your rights be restricted, and only in a way decided by a jury of your peers.    You guys in the big cities live different lifestyles, have different cultures, and eat different media than we do.  I don't blame you for hearing ""gun"" and thinking ""violence."" Just realize that down here, we use guns for ""anti-violence.""    Also, realize that the feds here aren't disarmed like in Chattanooga.  The establishment of Homeland security bases throughout the region happened the same time that the DHS bought over 1.6 Billion Rounds of Ammo.  The Jade Helm project also brought troops, weapons, heavy materiel, and even train cars fitted for mass prisoner transport.  Earlier this month I saw a tank in the parking lot of our local Toys R Us. Every American soldier is tasked with defending our homeland and upholding the constitution, and they must swear to it.  Our president has sworn to it also.  However, every veteran/active-duty soldier I've asked says only one thing matters to them: Following Orders.  I stand behind our Gov. Abbott because he is instructing the rangers to exercise their right (and duty) to protect the Texas homeland.  I stand behind our Federal government, military, and president to the extent that they keep their sworn oaths literally and without question.  Only the constitution can keep us all on the same side."

Even keeping the punishment punitive on the belief that if it wasn't people would do it more doesn't make sense for truly petty theft. At the end of the day, it really doesn't matter.  Except that this guy had also committed more than a dozen other thefts, meaning that, in this specific case, it's indicative of him relapsing into criminal behavior which might become worse as time progresses.

If you are better able to gather energy or defend yourself then you stand a better chance of surviving and passing these traits down. Accumulating energy allows functioning. This is physics, specifically thermodynamics. Things wear out and need maintenance. Also physics. It's not something evolution ""filters out"" because evolution is a secondary effect. It's us noting how things work and assigning a name to the phenomenon. There is no goal to it any more than there is an inherent deep meaning to a grouping of 5 objects.

The civil war is interesting in how we remember and honor it.  The south lost.  They have a right to remember their dead but sometimes it feels like southern states want to be honored as if they actually won the war.  I think the backlash against the flag that you see now is the result of people tolerating the southern states' delusional attitude towards the civil war for decades.

That is not meant as disrespect; however, you cannot deny their are cultural differences between the north and south.  That said, I think the vast majority of southerns take great pride in also being Americans. But that does not offset the honor that we feel towards our ancestors. When I see memorials that are meant to honor their sacrifices being vandalized you can see how infuriating that can become.  The recent events started with hate and have only escalated with more hate. The people who vandalize memorials will not create shame for southern heritage...they'll only cause hate and potentially violent backlash. There is no positive result for this type of action."

This part loses more material every time I move it, and I will keep my eye on it and try to keep it in one peace for my entire life, but its not in good condition.  A space suit has materials much closer to that gas mask than the uniform itself, which while they are very tough and durable, time, oxygen, humidity and temperature will take their toll on that material.
