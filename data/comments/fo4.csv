Did I miss any?  They're all sandwiches made on a long role. They have different names in different places. I was raised in Northeast Pennsylvania so I'm most familiar with Hoagies.  I'm pretty sure that Hero comes from Gyro, a Greek sandwich that's pronounced the same.  I wonder if Speedies and Philly Cheese Steaks count as Hoagies?"

fo4,3dqxrl,tyme,3,Sat Jul 18 17:17:50 2015 UTC,Facial capture is confirmed. The male protagonist talks about it a bit here. https://youtu.be/1KC5rttlnC8
fo4,3dqxrl,Th3oriesMan,2,Sat Jul 18 20:30:11 2015 UTC,"Idk the exacts lol; but I'm sure Bethesda uses some form of mocap for parts (at least) of their games; as it is an industry standard for animation. They might rely more on CG, but at some point they need mocap (just like everyone else dose) to simulate movements that they can input into their CG system in order to create CG animations."
fo4,3dqxrl,tyme,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:47:31 2015 UTC,Motion capture is becoming more of a standard now-a-days and then animators clean up the animations (mo-cap normally produces rough and ugly cycles) because it's better to start with something rough then to build it from scratch. It also allows for different types of movements to be made quicker. Super mutants move differently than a normal person so mo-cap can be used to rough out the way those characters carry themselves based off actors' movements.
fo4,3dqxrl,Me-as-I,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:37:53 2015 UTC,You don't need motion capture to make animations. It can be helpful but it isn't necessary.
fo4,3dqxrl,tyme,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:47:37 2015 UTC,"Well yes; you can spend hours programming and pulling from code libraries, the information you need to set up animation software in order to correctly (or as close to) simulate movement for animation. My point is that it is much much MUCH easier to do some form of preliminary mocap and get that data for the system and build your simulations off from there lol."
fo4,3dqxrl,Me-as-I,-1,Sat Jul 18 22:31:22 2015 UTC,"Why is there an ""lol"" at the end of your comment?"

fo4,3dqxrl,bowtiesarcool,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:40:23 2015 UTC,"If a game has somewhat complex, realistic animations, and the devs want to make the best use of their time, it is necessary. Animating something like a person by hand without mo-cap would be an unnecessary waste of time, since there is a much faster method."

For example, when Ranger Milo in New Vegas tells you about ""The Legion Snakes"", your low int character can respond saying ""Snakes are small, why not just shoot them?""

fo4,3dq9wv,IoWnUrSol,5,Sat Jul 18 22:55:01 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, one of the mass effect games (not certain which one) had about 40,000, TOTAL. With FO4, each playable character has 13,000, and that's not even accounting for npc dialogue  Edit: ME3 had 40,000 lines of dialogue total"

fo4,3dq9wv,realpieceofwork,6,Sun Jul 19 06:42:00 2015 UTC,I am the narrator. That's the main draw for me with these games. I'm not a fan of a voiced protagonist and the new smaller chat system.   If there's not a tempo changer for the voice then multiple playthroughs with different characters is going to suck.
fo4,3dq9wv,Someguy029,-1,Sat Jul 18 18:21:10 2015 UTC,"I'm in agreement. I don't want every one of my characters to sound like the voice subset GenericWhiteMale_01. Here's hoping a mod eventually comes out that eliminates the voice or maybe we'll get lucky and we'll be able to disable it.   cringe  ""Let's go fuck shit up.""   Like, can we not? Don't ever say that again, protagonist."

Not to mention that unless we'll get some dialogue options whenever the character is making an observation, this is just dialogue we have no control over."
fo4,3dq9wv,Th3oriesMan,5,Sat Jul 18 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"Well they did make a d20 fallout if you want to RP :)  But jokes aside; after you play the game, just remember that character's story the way YOU remember it lol; don't worry so much about the voice acting. Besides; in earlier fallouts, you did not have control over what was said anyways.  You had a set number of choices that were essentially a 'good'; 'neutral'; 'bad'; 'annyoed' and 'pissed off' choices. Most likey; with higher INT/CHA/PER and perks; you will have those choices again, with a selection button allowing you to 'turn the page' of conversational choices.  Yeah; we don't get to read them all out this time around, but that's not a bad thing. The whole point is to experience the voice acting and the animation that goes along with it, in order to enhance the experience of the game. And if you go down the 'wrong path' of a conversation, then just remember to quicksave before talking with a specific person and reload.  Hell; I'm gonna be reloading a lot just because I WANT to hear and see what happens with each choice, just like I did in Mass Effect lmao."
fo4,3dq9wv,MarlaSingersJeans,3,Sat Jul 18 19:58:53 2015 UTC,you can see in the gameplay footage that when you interact with objects the character makes an observation...so doesn't seem you would have much choice over that but who knows?   not a big deal for me personally.
fo4,3dq9wv,FiveFinger_Discount,5,Sat Jul 18 16:59:15 2015 UTC,"Would it be a big deal if you're trying to be stealthy and there your character is chuntering about his surroundings, possibly giving your position away?"
fo4,3dq9wv,MarlaSingersJeans,6,Sat Jul 18 17:34:38 2015 UTC,They will probably make it to where when you talk near an enemy they will not detect you. Many stealth games do similar things like this. Thief for example is a stealth game in which the main character constantly talks to himself about what he should do (more as a tutorial for the player) and nobody ever hears him. Its a quite simple mechanic to implement really.

I'm just dying to get my hands on the game, with the push to monetize Skyrim mods, I think it's reasonable to assume they considered it for FO4 during development and put more effort than any other development cycle so far towards expanding the modding tools. I'm hoping at least!"
fo4,3dqypa,Artraxia,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:56:55 2015 UTC,It eas Valve's idea for monetization and some Bethesda Softworks (publisher) big-wig went along with it. I don't see Todd Howard going along with that willingly.  It will take few months to release the mod kit according to the dev. Odds are they don't have much of anything of one right now and will basically be making the whole thing after launch.
fo4,3dqypa,MSG1000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:23:36 2015 UTC,"What Todd does or doesn't want is irrelevant here, if paid content from users is being considered seriously (it is, and has likely been in the works long enough to influence FO4's development cycle) it's likely they'll invest into the tools these mod authors will be using. There have been more than a few mod authors who have asked Bethesda if they can monetize their mod making hobby in some way to continue modding full time and Bethesda legally didn't have the leeway to allow it. They will keep trying, though with the proposed 25% cut for authors they'd have to charge quite a bit to be able to do it full time, so it obviously needs to be re-worked. Of course it's also plausible that no one budges on their cuts and the whole thing never materializes.  Also, Bethesda uses the Creation Kit in some capacity to build their game, otherwise the original content wouldn't be something you could mess with in the Creation Kit without the game being patched after launch. I'm not talking overwrites either.  Lastly, when I talk about them building up the modding tools, they have to make everything within the engine and then make it available for users to call on without having to hack the game in some capacity. Though we'll likely see a script extender doing just that to add more functionality anyways, it's basically tradition at this point."

As far as I know Fanta has been invented by the german branch of Coca Cola(Coca Cola GmbH), when the trade embargos hit WW2-germany and the syrup for Coke couldn't be importet anymore. Once the war was over, Fanta became an international brand of the Coca Cola Company.   I think it would be funny to find a Nuka-brand that has been derived from a canadian variant. Something like the Pluton Cola Frost, a cyan version, sweetened with maple sirup and flavoured with cranberries or some other winter-resistant fruit.

I'm glad they're wearing armor and proper gear covering most of their body in Fallout 4, as opposed to being almost bare chested, which doesn't make a lot of sense even in a wasteland world.

I mean, i get that resources and such are scarce, but why do they always have random things strapped to them?  I understand that its for the whole setting and whatnot, but its like the second the bombs drop, everybody rushes to strap every kitchen appliance they can find to their head.   Did they not get a chance to at least raid a clothes store or two when shit went south?"
fo4,3dp4aa,so_dericious,32,Sat Jul 18 06:47:59 2015 UTC,"Well, this does take place 200 years AFTER the apocalypse... so I'd assume clothes weren't all THAT common, but then again, there's plenty of people who have them.  Most raiders are batshit crazy, and don't have much decency, so I imagine the more psychotic look is done to fit with their theme a bit. The straps and such? I assume that's for utility. Able to clip a bunch of shit onto those."

There are gangs of raiders, like the gangs we have now, rough and tough, punkish, rebellious, violent and territorial.  There are tribal raiders, more post-primitive than anything, and very protective of their areas and people but as often peaceful and mercantile as they are savage and cannibalistic.  There are groups of refugees from abandoned cities, or outcasts from junk towns, survivors from ruined Vaults, and other modern citizens in violent, grizzled bands of survivors, often more pragmatic but just as deadly.  You can't just quantify a whole group of people into one mindset, as they could be scavengers, rapists, thugs, survivors, or just misguided feral people."

fo4,3doz4s,Zenth93,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:09:07 2015 UTC,"While I don't think this proves anything, I'm cool with the map being Skyrim sized. We have to factor in the subterranean, interior, and vertical space as well. I do enjoy the feeling of having to trek long distances, but I think I would rather have a well developed, focused map than a bunch of nothing dotted with locations."
fo4,3doz4s,Miss_Darko,2,Sat Jul 18 02:11:31 2015 UTC,Hope its bigger the FO3. It felt small compared to skyrim. Not sure if it is. but it did.
fo4,3doz4s,Jag19d,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:42:14 2015 UTC,"I'm almost positive that FO3 is smaller (by a good amount) than Skyrim. But part of that feeling might be because of how open and free Skyrim feels, whereas in FO3 movement felt kind of restricted, with the narrow streets and extremely long subway tunnels."
fo4,3doz4s,BlueEyedRage,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:28:34 2015 UTC,"Fallout 3 is actually one of the larger worlds while Skyrim is one of the smaller ones. Skyrim's hills, mountains, and lack of straight paths make it seem like there is much more to it. Render distance too. If you jack up the render distance outside of the general settings you can see how close the towns actually are together. It's pretty funny when you increase the render distance and toggle off collision just outside Whiterun and see how close Rorikstead actually is, and on paper that's supposed to be a pretty far distance while it looks like it's barely a 1/10th of a mile.  The scaling is a lot worse too whenever there is a mountain between two locations. The distance is usually 5 times or more shorter than what you travel."
fo4,3doz4s,Jag19d,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:43:37 2015 UTC,"Source on that?  I've just always felt that if I move in a straight line and check my map every now and then, my icon moves a lot farther in Fallout 3 than it does in Skyrim. I mean, shit, there's a reason why if you don't like fast travel (like me) you can buy a horse. It takes too damn long to walk from one side of the map to the other in Skyrim. Hell, it takes a long time even with a horse. But in Fallout 3 I can make it from Rivet City to The Pitt entrance in a few in-game days. And there's no shortage of mountains in Fallout, either."
fo4,3doz4s,DieterEmmerling,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:05:56 2015 UTC,http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1264541-skyrimoblivionmorrowind-heightmap-comparison/  There are not nearly as many mountains in the CW than there are in Skyrim and none of Skyrim's magnitude. Skyrim was purposely designed to have you run zigzagged so it would seem like you've traveled further.  Of course it's easy to traverse the map in Fallout 3 compared to Skyrim because relatively speaking travel routes in Fallout 3 are much more efficient than in Skyrim.

fo4,3dn722,gnothi_seauton,3,Fri Jul 17 23:42:19 2015 UTC,"I am sure that this has already been discussed but watching this video it finally clicked.  Do you think perhaps the laser musket does not take any ammo and just needs a crank?  Edit:  I was wrong.  The ammo is in the lower, right-hand corner."
fo4,3dn722,gnothi_seauton,7,Fri Jul 17 18:55:59 2015 UTC,"If you notice on the bottom right hand of the screen, you can see the ammo count. Now here is the speculation part; does he crank once per charge? At the beginning as he picks it up he cranks it twice and you can clearly see two charges. Other times he has 1 charge that he shoots out. Sometimes he cranks once and has two charges. My opinion is this; you can have multiple charges (stronger hitting shot). The times it does show two charges for one crank is simply the footage being broken up.  Thoughts?  Edit: words"
fo4,3dn722,thebubz,2,Fri Jul 17 19:02:19 2015 UTC,"I see the ammo count now.  There was a window overlay which was blocking it, so I missed that.  He starts with 520 total, cranks once, and then cranks again.  Each crank loads a charge (2/518).  Then, it cuts to another scene where he is cranking to load a second charge (2/501).  When he fires, both are discharged. He double cranks (2/499). Again, both are discharged.  After the next cut, you have picked up a bunch of ammo (2/985). You fire, discharging both but you only crank once (1/984).  Next, cut you have (2/496), fire, double crank, then crit. When the animation stops, you have (1/514).  Clearly, you can only have one charge loaded but we never see him fire with only one charge.  It only shows shots after you double crank.  I hope that you are right that multiple charges equal more damage.  Although, I could also imagine a game balancing mechanic for an early weapon to require loading two charges before it would fire.   I can't wait."
fo4,3dn722,HiroProtagonist1,2,Fri Jul 17 19:22:35 2015 UTC,At the 3:00 minute mark he charges once and looks as though he is getting ready to fire it before the screen is jumped to a different instance. Truly difficult to discern exactly how it works due to the time frame constantly jumping around.

fo4,3dn722,munchybot,4,Fri Jul 17 20:55:46 2015 UTC,"Because his name was literally ""Phil Spencer"". If it was only ""Phil"" Codsworth would probably have said it. Remember that Todd Howard only put in ""Howard"" as his name on the E3 Conference presentation."

Based on Codsworth calling you ""Mr. (or Mrs. presumably) so-and-so"" I'd be inclined to think they recorded common last names. It would make sense if that's the case, because Phil isn't much of a last name but if they did record first names I don't see why it wouldn't be included.  I just really wanna hear him call me Mr. Evans but I'm not holding by breath."

fo4,3dre9s,stonedspacemonkey,9,Sat Jul 18 18:53:38 2015 UTC,"There are 20 slots, they were counted a while back. They was also a screenshot of a Barter Bobblehead.  Due note that in the Pipboy tabs are faded depending on how far away they are from the current tab.   see this video: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3dn722/video_uploaded_by_bethesda_not_new_footage_still/  Look at the part where he looks at the Pipboy at the start of the video; the Perks tab was almost invisible. Also considering the existence of the Perk Chart; it maybe that skills and perks are combined.  Until we get more detail on how SPECIAL and PERKS work we can only be sure that they changed how they work, not that skills are completely absent.  EDIT: Here is the picture of the Bobblehead stand: https://i.imgur.com/QM1ZHQ3.jpg  Notice that if you count the spots for all 3 levels the total comes to 20 and that there is the Charisma, Agility and Barter Bobbleheads in his inventory.  In addition see this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/3a2i3r/new_skillperk_system_explained_using_the_only/  In his imgur link and his text post he shows that perks now have multiple ranks associated with him such as Science! and Gun Nut and are requirements for various weapon modding and crafting.   If skills are not in the game then they are simply combined with Perks, which honestly perks are what your character so powerful in the first place in my experience."
fo4,3dre9s,MSG1000,2,Sat Jul 18 20:00:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty sure skills have been rolled into perks, they only mattered at 25% intervals anyway. I'd imagine the bobbles do S.P.E.C.I.A.L. and certain general ranked perks."
fo4,3dre9s,aukir,2,Sat Jul 18 22:39:10 2015 UTC,I think weapon skills added a little bit for every point but in general everything needed an increase of 10 in order for you to notice the difference in combat or in unlocking crafting recipes at the Workbench or Reloading Bench.
fo4,3dre9s,MSG1000,4,Sun Jul 19 00:48:49 2015 UTC,"Tons of evidence points to skills being out of the game. For those who don't know, this includes the fact that intelligence now increases experience gained, instead of skill points, and many things require a certain perk, eg making certain parts to a laser weapon requires a certain rank of the ""Science!"" perk, and many bullet-oriented weapons require the ""Gun Nut"" perk, also in varying ranks. However, when the player places the bobblehead stand, we can see a Barter Bobblehead in the player inventory. This doesn't necessarily mean thats skills are in fact in the game, but it could. Alternatively, certain bobbleheads could augment other player stats. Its all speculation at this point, and nothing is confirmed, but its interesting to talk about"
fo4,3dre9s,internet_user999,3,Sat Jul 18 19:18:42 2015 UTC,"There are bobblehead mods that change the skill increase to a perk centered around that particular skill. It could very well be something like that.  That, or it's just a collectible, and that's it."
fo4,3dre9s,Zathas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:58:15 2015 UTC,I didn't know about the barter bobblehead; I guess this means there is still a possibility for skills of some sort. Interesting.

fo4,3doz4s,Eissa_Cozorav,-9,Sat Jul 18 10:43:16 2015 UTC,There's real world scale and game map size. This is just a thought piece. If the FO4 game world is about the same size as Skyrim this isn't an unreasonable amount of the Boston area to have in the game.

fo4,3doz4s,StevenCrux,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:42:14 2015 UTC,"Fallout 3 is actually one of the larger worlds while Skyrim is one of the smaller ones. Skyrim's hills, mountains, and lack of straight paths make it seem like there is much more to it. Render distance too. If you jack up the render distance outside of the general settings you can see how close the towns actually are together. It's pretty funny when you increase the render distance and toggle off collision just outside Whiterun and see how close Rorikstead actually is, and on paper that's supposed to be a pretty far distance while it looks like it's barely a 1/10th of a mile.  The scaling is a lot worse too whenever there is a mountain between two locations. The distance is usually 5 times or more shorter than what you travel."
fo4,3doz4s,Eissa_Cozorav,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:28:34 2015 UTC,"Source on that?  I've just always felt that if I move in a straight line and check my map every now and then, my icon moves a lot farther in Fallout 3 than it does in Skyrim. I mean, shit, there's a reason why if you don't like fast travel (like me) you can buy a horse. It takes too damn long to walk from one side of the map to the other in Skyrim. Hell, it takes a long time even with a horse. But in Fallout 3 I can make it from Rivet City to The Pitt entrance in a few in-game days. And there's no shortage of mountains in Fallout, either."

Skyrim was purposely designed to have you run zigzagged so it would seem like you've traveled further.  Of course it's easy to traverse the map in Fallout 3 compared to Skyrim because relatively speaking travel routes in Fallout 3 are much more efficient than in Skyrim.

fo4,3doz4s,Jag19d,2,Sun Jul 19 21:00:31 2015 UTC,"Guys, OP isn't using the maps as ""proof"" that it's about the same size as Skyrim. That info came from a recent interview, where Todd Howard said FO4 and Skyrim could be said to be about the same size. He mentioned things like how mountains take up space in Skyrim and make routes more complex, so while he did not say this directly I think what he's getting at is that FO4's map size is roughly the same as Skyrim's, but without the mountains in the way, and without the barriers of towns as seen in previous Fallout games, making the playable area larger. OP should have been clearer about this, but oh well.  Given what's been suggested about some of the extent of the map (how far from downtown Boston some revealed locations may be), I think that information is just being used in conjunction with the size of Skyrim to get a rough idea of the scale we can expect given the information we have."
fo4,3doz4s,BlueEyedRage,2,Sat Jul 18 10:31:31 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the fact that Bethesda will combine other areas (Salem, Concord, for example) into the overall ""Boston"" area. They did this kind of thing in Fallout 3 as well."

If you look at our previous stuff, it's kind of like that. We don't actually measure it like that. Because Skyrim is one size, but the mountains take up a lot of space. That's not really a game place, it's in your way, you have to go around it, so we're not really doing that. In the city, it's very dense, but there is no load - like in Fallout 3, there's a load - for areas of the city, we don't do that. So it's very dense, the buildings are tall, and a lot of them are open, so you can just walk in and around, so... it's big. I wouldn't say, you know, if you played Skyrim, I couldn't tell you it's X bigger, so we're just saying it's about the same size.""

I'm still of the opinion that the whole 'baby Shaun' thing is Bethesda's way of introducing a new mechanic to the Fallout games where you can have community members shack up together and have babies, a-la Fallout Shelter (yes, I strongly suspect they're teasing us with some Fallout 4 details in that game), and with that I do reckon that both the PCs partner and the bubs are Dead Jim Dead.

Fallout 3 forced you to take specific background information.  Your mom had to die in childbirth.  Your dad had to leave the vault.  You had to follow him to progress the story.  You had to save him from Tranquility Lane to progress the story.  You had to address the Enclave as enemies.  Fallout New Vegas forced you to play a Courier who got shot in the head and left for dead, saved by a local doctor, etc. etc.  People keep acting like your character being forced to be certain things by the plot is some big betrayal of character RP, but it's always been this way.  You just have to ignore the parts you don't like.  People do so easily for FO3 and FNV, and you'll learn to do it easily for FO4."

fo4,3dt588,Halitrad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:52:56 2015 UTC,"It's no more problematic than someone wanting to roleplay the Courier as a coward who would have thrown the Platinum Chip at Benny and his thugs and run while screaming like a young child, having to deal with the fact that the game forces you to be shot over the Chip.  It's no more problematic than someone wanting to play the Lone Wanderer as a selfish misanthropist who'd never in a million years do anything to help the assholes in the Capital Wasteland who just wants the LW to do their dirty work and get killed for them accomplish ANYTHING, having to deal with the fact that you HAVE to choose to help /someone/ during the course of the plot.  People are familiar with these plot elements.  They know which ones they want to ignore and which ones they want to make part of their character.  People complaining about how the introduction to FO4 saddles your character with so much that they can't roleplay their character like they want to anymore, are just forgetting all the plot elements they have to add or ignore in previous titles to roleplay their characters like they want to."
fo4,3dt588,Halitrad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:03 2015 UTC,yeah i get you on that. but like they haven't rly ever made decisions for you. the guy in fo4 seems to have settled down and has a kid. and tbh i don't want to play someone like that. in fo3 sure to complete the story you had to do things but they never rly told you what you where
fo4,3dt588,Halitrad,8,Sun Jul 19 05:24:23 2015 UTC,They made decisions for you all the time.  In FNV you had to be a Courier.  You had a VERY deep canon background explored by the addons and through Ulysses.  We're not talking a few facts.  Your character had an entire established series of lifetime achievements pre-intro.  In FO3 you had to be the kid of the vault doctor.  You had to leave the vault.  There were all kinds of decisions made for you in order to make the plot work.  There is literally no difference between what FO3 and FNV did and what FO4 is doing.  It just seems massively different because you haven't seen it 30 times already and figured out which bits you like and which you don't.
fo4,3dt588,Halitrad,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:43:13 2015 UTC,nv is different bc you are givin the job of courier. but in fo3 they are things that happen to you not things you chose to do like you never get to chose your mum and dad .but in fall out 4 it seems like you not given the option or weather or not you want to get marred and have a baby witch is just a bit irritating
fo4,3dt588,qsts,6,Sun Jul 19 05:54:19 2015 UTC,"In FNV you aren't given the option of whether or not you want to take the job that gets you executed.  In FO3 you aren't given the option of whether or not you would go to a birthday party filled with your bullies.  In FNV you aren't given the option of whether or not you want to be a Courier.  In FO3 you aren't given the option of whether or not you want to leave the Vault.  There is no difference, man.  The difference is only in your own mind."
fo4,3dt588,Thrive-Storm,-5,Sun Jul 19 06:15:33 2015 UTC,ok sure but there things that happen to you. its a lil bit diffrent being given a dude or girl that is marryed and with kids.
fo4,3dt588,OldWorldNomad,8,Sun Jul 19 06:25:44 2015 UTC,"It's not different at all.  That's what I'm trying to get you to understand.  There is no difference between 'You are a Courier.  You stride the Mojave Wasteland with only one mission: Deliver your package.' and 'You are a veteran.  Though you've left the battlefield behind, married, had a child, some things can never be forgotten.'  They're only different because you've experienced the former, and are anxious about the details of the latter."
fo4,3dt588,SlySychoGamer,-1,Sun Jul 19 06:38:52 2015 UTC,yeah im use to playing more of a blank slate that i can protect something on to and im worried that i wont be able to as much with this guy
fo4,3dt588,_Rosseau_,4,Sun Jul 19 07:49:45 2015 UTC,"Role playing will be easier because the protagonist is voiced. You're given context for your actions. The world reflects the choices you make instead of just mentioned by NPCs that are frozen in time whenever you speak to them.  Your background in F4 gives a tangible explanation for your skills, as opposed to F3 where killing 500 feral ghouls can make you a master locksmith (which is why I'm glad the skills system is being removed).  Your background provides context for the things you do. If you want the story to actually make sense, if you want to do side quests and ignore the main quest, if you want to role play without suspending your disbelief, exposition for your character is necessary. Yes, we can always create it ourselves, but I'd rather have a professional writer do it for me."
fo4,3dt588,SlySychoGamer,-4,Sun Jul 19 09:04:56 2015 UTC,all im saying is i hope there will be a mod to make role playing easier
fo4,3dt588,_Rosseau_,3,Sun Jul 19 09:49:22 2015 UTC,"how about after the cryo sleep, all memories of your past seem very distant, almost like another person going through the motions. After you wake up, your real life begins... something like that, if that line of thinking would help you roleplay better"
fo4,3dt588,Chuckanacka,5,Sun Jul 19 06:12:12 2015 UTC,"There will most certainly be an alternate start mod, and a mod that removes the characters voice entirely, just like the previous games. I imagine for the 'no voice' mod, when your character replies to people, their lines will be skipped."
fo4,3dt588,giulianosse,2,Sun Jul 19 06:39:18 2015 UTC,"I get what OP is saying, with the more scripted narrative, I hope we get mods that can customize said narrative."
fo4,3dt588,Vorpal_Kitten,3,Sun Jul 19 06:15:54 2015 UTC,"Skyrim had a great alternative start mod.  Seeing they use a similar engine, I don't see why this can't be done by hard working modders."
fo4,3dt588,SlySychoGamer,4,Sun Jul 19 07:33:41 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure the family man type stuff will pop back into the main story, I don't doubt that for a second."
fo4,3dt588,SlySychoGamer,3,Sun Jul 19 07:38:02 2015 UTC,"Well in the Skyrim mod, basically the main questline has to trigger for any other event of being called ""Dovahkin"" takes place.  So basically in the skyrim mod, you can choose never to trigger the main storyline and skip it entirely for whatever you want to do. You also spawn in all sorts of weird places depending on what background you chose.   It seems modding an alternative start can be quite extensive, as far as I can tell."
fo4,3dt588,DrakonLitshed,5,Sun Jul 19 08:11:27 2015 UTC,That mod was awesome. I think I started as a shipwreck victim and nearly froze to death with hardcore needs on before getting to a town and starting my life of crime. Awesome sauce.

Personally I don't make up my own characters beyond good-guy/bad-guy so it doesn't bother me. But I get the other side of the arguement that it kind of forces you into a niche character."

If they switch it back we're then locked in place again and have to sit through all their shit until we get a Go Away text option just like all previous bethesda games."

What if due to the new format I cant just politely shut someone up without using ammo?"
fo4,3dtl1x,Darkseedx,2,Sun Jul 19 22:33:44 2015 UTC,"Let me re-watch the footage but so far i think one of the dialogue options is always a goodbye one unless your deep in the middle of a conversation, but it would still amount to the same. If u had the option (maybe it was just press B/O in FO3&NV but i remember having trouble finding an exit to some dialogue and pressing cancel button didn't work to exit just skiped their lines to reach my next option) you ended their dialogue there and walked away, with the new system u don't even have to press that just walk away and the npc will just shut up once their done what they were in the middle of saying or maybe it'll be like dark souls and they might interrupt their own dialogue with like ""Hey! Where are you going!?"" and then shut up regardless lol. it all feels more fluid, less restrictive and less like npc are information dispenser machines."
fo4,3dtl1x,DrakonLitshed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:42:16 2015 UTC,I don't get why this keeps being brought up. It's a simple fix for any system. Have one analog move up and down the dialogue box and the other turn yourself away to exit text for console. For PC you would just move the mouse to the corner of the screen.
fo4,3dtl1x,Zathas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:47:41 2015 UTC,"That's an issue because your not locked in place with bethesda's version, at any time while a character is talking you can freely look and move around which requires both joysticks, the dialogue options only appear contextually as you look right at the npc."
fo4,3dtl1x,DrakonLitshed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:31 2015 UTC,"Then I don't know, move the dialogue select to the D-Pad. My solution still allows the user to leave the conversation while using a dialogue window. There is no issue."
fo4,3dtl1x,Zathas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:07:56 2015 UTC,"they'll probably use segway dialogue that leads to other choices something like ""Ask about ..."" that will give you more options."

fo4,3dtl1x,KreepingLizard,2,Sun Jul 19 10:54:26 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe. Depends on how their programming is organized. It could be as simple as disabling the voice, or as difficult as disabling the voice on every dialogue option throughout the whole game."

fo4,3dtl1x,KreepingLizard,3,Sun Jul 19 23:46:04 2015 UTC,The voiced protagonist has pretty much been discussed to death.   My advice would be to reserve judgement until we've seen more. QuakeCon is less than a week away and I'm sure we'll see or hear more about the dialogue there.

fo4,3dq2xm,glomevace,6,Sat Jul 18 12:48:59 2015 UTC,"I think the synths we saw in the gameplay, given their dilapidated state, are likely the androids who escaped the institute. There will likely be more androids inside the Institute, but they're meant to be visually indistinguishable from a human, and the ones we saw at E3 are have clearly fallen apart. From the lore we have, it's unlikely the androids will have any power, as they're mainly treated as slaves."
fo4,3dq2xm,internet_user999,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:00:09 2015 UTC,"I think there's two types of synths, there's the new ones we're seeing which are very robotic and probably mass produced for the manual labor/security use, then the realistic synths (like Harnkins) are rare and used primarily for espionage/contact with other humans. Can u imagine how people would have flipped to see a basic synth in Rivet City?"

fo4,3dq2xm,DrakonLitshed,4,Mon Jul 20 00:42:06 2015 UTC,"I think it would be risky (from the Institutes perspective) to give them too much independence, especially if they are designed for combat or espionage.  They would have to have some method of maintaining control over their creations.  Some androids are designed to hunt down escaped androids, so clearly there is a limited heirarchy, where some androids have a greater degree of freedom."
fo4,3dq2xm,lutes23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:20:39 2015 UTC,The synth quest in Fo3 i believe (it's been a while since i did it) has a part where if u side with zimmerman he tells you the pass/code word to say that will reset Harnkins wiping his memory and returning him to an obedient synth.
fo4,3dq2xm,DrakonLitshed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:47:53 2015 UTC,I think there could be a potential quest line within the Institute in which the player could choose to help an aspiring android rise to power in a violent overthrow to lead the Institute and it's synth forces - this is assuming it starts out being controlled by humans.

fo4,3dn722,gnothi_seauton,3,Fri Jul 17 23:42:19 2015 UTC,"I am sure that this has already been discussed but watching this video it finally clicked.  Do you think perhaps the laser musket does not take any ammo and just needs a crank?  Edit:  I was wrong.  The ammo is in the lower, right-hand corner."
fo4,3dn722,gnothi_seauton,7,Fri Jul 17 18:55:59 2015 UTC,"If you notice on the bottom right hand of the screen, you can see the ammo count. Now here is the speculation part; does he crank once per charge? At the beginning as he picks it up he cranks it twice and you can clearly see two charges. Other times he has 1 charge that he shoots out. Sometimes he cranks once and has two charges. My opinion is this; you can have multiple charges (stronger hitting shot). The times it does show two charges for one crank is simply the footage being broken up.  Thoughts?  Edit: words"
fo4,3dn722,thebubz,2,Fri Jul 17 19:02:19 2015 UTC,"I see the ammo count now.  There was a window overlay which was blocking it, so I missed that.  He starts with 520 total, cranks once, and then cranks again.  Each crank loads a charge (2/518).  Then, it cuts to another scene where he is cranking to load a second charge (2/501).  When he fires, both are discharged. He double cranks (2/499). Again, both are discharged.  After the next cut, you have picked up a bunch of ammo (2/985). You fire, discharging both but you only crank once (1/984).  Next, cut you have (2/496), fire, double crank, then crit. When the animation stops, you have (1/514).  Clearly, you can only have one charge loaded but we never see him fire with only one charge.  It only shows shots after you double crank.  I hope that you are right that multiple charges equal more damage.  Although, I could also imagine a game balancing mechanic for an early weapon to require loading two charges before it would fire.   I can't wait."
fo4,3dn722,HiroProtagonist1,2,Fri Jul 17 19:22:35 2015 UTC,At the 3:00 minute mark he charges once and looks as though he is getting ready to fire it before the screen is jumped to a different instance. Truly difficult to discern exactly how it works due to the time frame constantly jumping around.

Based on Codsworth calling you ""Mr. (or Mrs. presumably) so-and-so"" I'd be inclined to think they recorded common last names. It would make sense if that's the case, because Phil isn't much of a last name but if they did record first names I don't see why it wouldn't be included.

fo4,3dnv52,Tedoro,8,Fri Jul 17 20:26:44 2015 UTC,He is probably crying because he knows that his parents spell his name wrong.
fo4,3dnv52,Ds0990,10,Sat Jul 18 08:45:23 2015 UTC,"I do agree with what someone said in the Discussion that the baby is crying because the robot was changing the diapers. I would cry too if I was a baby and I saw that scary robot near me, let alone touching me. Must be a terrifying experience for a baby."
fo4,3dnv52,DerekMan,16,Fri Jul 17 20:37:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah if you've never seen one before, but if it's been in your house performing these types of tasks since you were born, in sure a baby would get pretty used to it. My little brother was terrified of a dog the first time he met one, but after a short time he got used to it."

fo4,3dnv52,3dEnt,5,Fri Jul 17 20:22:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think the baby is going to play any part in the game what so ever. The baby generated from the parents is something that's super easy to do technically, but they wanted to say something impressive.   All the game has to do is take the average of the two values the player set for the female and male character. Super easy."
fo4,3dnv52,Honeycone,2,Fri Jul 17 21:33:55 2015 UTC,"To an extent they've already done that before as well, Jame's appearance in Fo3 is based on your own character and I recall a similar system for children in Skyrim (although that may have been from a mod, now that I think of it). While he's a baby there's literally no reason to make him look like the parents, and besides maybe skin and eye color there won't be any discernible difference between babies for different players anyway.  Also I agree that he most likely won't be part of the game, if you're the lone survivor of the vault then obviously the baby either died or never got into the vault at all. Plus he would be long dead by the time of the game anyway. However, I have a spurious feeling that his/your descendants will make an appearance in the game, that way there can still be an NPC loosely based on your character that isn't a baby."
fo4,3dnv52,SnippyTheDeliveryFox,5,Sat Jul 18 12:43:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm more interested in the mods for the pre-war era than about what the baby is doing.

It would be awesome if we could explore outside, and the mobile is the point of no return, like the ones in other Fallout games. Another point towards this is that I think the game starts 2 years before the war. (Info from YouTube video, seemed to be credible. Correct me if I'm wrong). This raises the question of what we do before the war, which probably won't be restricted to the house. Hype level increased, once again! Thoughts?"

fo4,3dnv52,Kiyoko504,-2,Fri Jul 17 23:13:57 2015 UTC,Some of the discussion there does seem perhaps too overly detailed with small details that are not that relevant to gameplay.  I think they do have a point there with the question as to why the husband lets the wife run with the baby rather than carry the baby himself.
fo4,3dnv52,DerekMan,8,Fri Jul 17 20:17:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe the wife wants to hold the baby. Maybe because he doesn't automatically assume she's not capable of doing it. I'm sure you didn't mean to be sexist, but that's how this comment comes across as."
fo4,3dnv52,Xelian86,9,Fri Jul 17 20:42:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed, though the real reason is probably gameplay. You are about to run to the vault, and it wouldve been quite a turn-off having to start the game running first person with a screaming baby in front of your face.  I am guessing that if you play as the wife, the husband will carry the baby."
fo4,3dnv52,tiranama,3,Fri Jul 17 20:52:35 2015 UTC,Agreed. This is likely the gameplay reason for this.
fo4,3dnv52,Xelian86,2,Fri Jul 17 21:16:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Plus, the husband will be carrying the baby if you play as a female. Probably.  Edit: Oops. I just realized I just repeated the last sentence in the comment I replyed to. Sorry..."

What was the last time IRL that a group of people dedicated to a cause actually took to naming themselves after another group of people hundreds of years in the past who had just a kinda vaguely similar goal as themselves.   for 2 factions fighting for freedom.   The Civil War would be a much more appropriate example here, especially if it involves the synths fighting for freedom (fighting against slavery and oppression by individual people as well as a government that doesn't care instead of fighting over being treated worse as provinces by an overseas power is one example of why it fits better).  It is hardly as if people rebelling against those in charge though is unique enough to focus so heavily on the American Revolution."

Mods - do we suddenly go from fully talking to mute all of a sudden? Modders can have voice-actors for quest-givers, but now they have to get voice-acting for players as well, which is gonna sound off as hell.  b.) Multiple characters - Oh hey, this voice is pretty cool, it suits my hard-ass marine character. Oh, he sounds the exact same as my nerd character and my cowboy character and my raider character and my assassin character... These are all different people, but they all sound the same, great.

I suspect, given the sheer amount of recorded dialogue we're being told is in the game (both PC actors have been recording for the last two years), that modders will just do what they already do.  For example, we already have lots of mods that turn NPCs into followers.  Generally, they do so by repurposing their existing dialogue.  They pull snippets from that NPCs one quest or bits and bobs from other characters the same actor voiced.  Here, we're going to likely have thousands of lines catering to a vast range of situations and emotional tones.  Aside from referencing your custom Quest NPC -- Jimbo van Doogan the Third of Fuckington Abbey -- directly by name, I suspect most situations will be covered.  Modders are a resourceful bunch; I think they'll make it work."

fo4,3dlzih,KreepingLizard,7,Fri Jul 17 11:00:59 2015 UTC,"Bitching isn't going to change it, but people should be allowed to have differing opinions. It's a bit sad if we get to a point that you aren't allowed to voice your honest opinion if you dislike something here. For me, the dialogue is a key part of what makes Fallout Fallout and if that gets stunted in any way, the game will have much less appeal to me. It's also saddening to me that they are going down a route that so many other games are going these days with this wheel, essentially making AAA games even more homogeneous.  Of course, I might still enjoy it when it comes out, but I'm sceptical and I think this subreddit should be open to discussions like that."

Sure, people who are excited for or more neutral towards the dialogue wheel, get your voices out there, but I don't like the suggestion from any side of this that the opposing side shouldn't get to voice their opinion.   I can understand getting tired of it, though. Sadly, Reddit's voting system promotes homogeneousness since you'll often be downvoted for dissenting, so it's about finding the right ""room"", I guess. Maybe creating two different threads for criticism and excitement would be a good idea so you can choose to avoid one if you're tired of it."
fo4,3dlzih,Nemokles,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:53:20 2015 UTC,"No one's saying anyone can't voice their opinion.

I don't mind people having in-depth opinions about the nuances of voiced vs. silent."
fo4,3dlzih,KreepingLizard,2,Fri Jul 17 23:12:45 2015 UTC,"Well, no one is explicitly saying it, but saying things like ""no amount of bitching is going to make it not happen"" and the post we're commenting on are making it sort hostile for people who are sceptical of it. My experience is that Reddit works sort of like Hegelian dialectics, you get a thesis (the original critique of a voiced protagonist), then the anti-thesis (people disagreeing with the critique) and time will synthesis will be. But both the thesis and synthesis have a polemical nature where the two sides grow increasingly hateful towards each other. So that's what I'm reacting to here, the sense of hostility I'm getting from posts like these."

In an ideal world people would read through a few comments, realize their perspective has already been added and simply upvote, but we don't live in an ideal world and I really don't think it's realistic for large groups of people to act that way."

Thankfully, I didn't complain on the Internet but it upset me as a longtime fan of Fallout. Why? Because I love to replay the game multiple times as different characters. My audio broke on my desktop? No problem, I will play as an NCR vet that retired after heavy injuries that crippled him and left him deaf. Yes, people with helmets that obscured his lips meant we couldn't converse with.  Now then, I have calmed down since then. I'm still not pleased but I see potential. My biggest problem is the dialogue wheel. I don't like having to hope my character says what I want them to say. Another concern is that dialogue responses have been limited. Something that is likely true (I would be very surprise of them having low intellect dialogue which is a shame), and Bethesda's bad habit of having less than stellar writing.  All that said I chose to reserve any real opinions on the matter until the game comes out. For the irritation with guessing dialogue, they could go deus ex hr where hovering over the icon told you what your character would say, the dialogue might be limited but perhaps some button to show other dialogue responses, and it has been years since their last game. Who knows? Maybe they leveled up and got a perk in writing :P  Still, I honestly can't wait to play this game."

Redesign interaction ui to be in line with fallout 3/NV, delete PC's audio, restrict the viewpoint to first person, and use the contents of the subtitles over their corresponding dialogue choice. That's if there isn't an already custom-built option for it made by Bethesda. Out of the 3 possible ways it'll turn out, 2 of those are good, so I have faith in a brighter future for Fallout."

Super mutants in the west were created by the Master in military base in the california/nevada area somewhere. Supermutant in the east had a similar origin (as far as a big pool of nuclear FEV goo) but came from a vault. Are these DC mutants that migrated north or are they indeginous to Boston they seem smaller than previous mutant and so far all the familier creatures area smaller than they have been before (except deathclaws cause they all came from the west and migrated) so is it possible we have yet another source of mutants and why is everything so small in boston!?

Worth noting, though it doesn't directly tie in to anything right now, is that it appears there's no forced Level Up menu and that, as with Skyrim, once you earn a Perk point(and, if the most prevalent speculation is wrong, skill points) you're free to spend it when ever you feel like getting around to it, instead of ""whenever combat/dialog ends"".

They have a quest associated with them to improve their still.  They can then make whiskey, flamer fuel and molotov cocktails for the character.  *Mutant dog:  Hyper-intelligent and telepathic, but apparently it can only communicate with the player.  Also, kind of a dick.  Tries to encourage the player to murder and eat everyone.  The catch is that it might just be a normal dog and the player is experiencing psychotic delusions.  *Ghoul:  Someone you meet in the prologue before the bombs drop.  They survive and transform.  Maybe they were someone the protagonist went to high school with, maybe a neighbour or an aquaintance from work.  They used to be cheerful and now they are apathetic and curmudgeonly.

Everyone is using the baby generation to justify the family surviving, i'm not saying it's wrong but when the follow up comment is always ""they wouldn't make this if they die at the beginning"" keep in mind its not like bethesda went out of their way to make that program they already used it in FO3 for the father."

But by New Vegas Bounties II, he had clearly gotten a better grasp of the tools and how to use them so he created a much larger, more dynamic experience.

Personally basing a post apocalyptic map on new york i would probably use ""central park"" as a sort of hub area where some town has sprung up and then have ur quests lead off through ""corridor-ed"" paths through the collapsed and rubbled buildings above and the trashed but mostly intact tunnels below, new york has a vast network of subway tunnels and even older tunnels below those so there's option and choice on where to go but not a massive open world. Feral ghouls would definitely be very rampant through an area that had such a high population, if the game doesn't include it itself maybe your main quest (or a side quest) can involve helping a none feral glowing one (similar to NV) and the final quest reward being  a perk that increases/gives companions health regen the more irradiated you are?"

Flame has long been in fallout and electricity i think was added later and it's definitely in 4, so far 4 adds cryo as well so need a little time with the game to see what else can be added, monsters seem to inflict direct Rad damage when they attack and i had a discussion in another thread with someone about rad grenades so if 4 doesn't weaponize that i think that would be a mod feature to give your expansion a bit of it's own unique flair and fits with the heavy radiation theme, you can bet NY was nuked to bloody hell being one of America's biggest most influential cities."

Given we have a very limited amount of information to work on- but it appears that power armor may work essentially like additional HP to specific sections of the body. So possibly with precise targeting (i.e. vats) one could knock a section of the power armor off and hit the person underneath and kill them.   This is shown in the combat montage with the player shooting a brotherhood member in a suit of power armor with a missile, the HP bar of him doesn't go down but a chunk of armor flies off.   Similarly, when the raider in what has been dubbed ""raider power armor"" is charging at him with a sledgehammer, he shoots him straight in the chest with a shotgun- and the chest piece flies off, but no apparent damage to the enemy."

fo4,3dk7au,MaddestOfHatters,18,Thu Jul 16 22:55:10 2015 UTC,IIRC there is a raider during the e3 gameplay with power armor on and no helmet. It's when the main character shoots a mini nuke.
fo4,3dk7au,Feenecks,4,Thu Jul 16 23:31:55 2015 UTC,Yeah. I saw that. Hopefully that means we can do the same thing.

fo4,3dk7au,tfaddy,2,Fri Jul 17 12:34:21 2015 UTC,"Actually, in the showcase, there's a part where the player shoots a raider psycho with a rifle, this destroy a chest piece which reveals an exoskeleton suit which looks exactly like the one used for the actual power armor seen in the garage, so I'm certain that raider armor was indeed makeshift/scavenged PA, or will work exactly like it."

fo4,3dk7au,CheshireHyena,9,Fri Jul 17 00:23:48 2015 UTC,"Idk, the way that the power armor seems to be set up in FO4, it looks like all one big piece. While it would be cool to be able to omit a part like the helmet, I think we're going to have to wear the entire thing."

fo4,3dk7au,ZigzagPX4,3,Fri Jul 17 18:09:41 2015 UTC,"Fallout 3's BoS already made power armor helmet removal ability canon, especially visible on Sarah Lyons.  I'm guessing when we enter the suit, opening the Pip-Boy in it (how are we even going to use the Pip-Boy in the suit now?) shows us with power armor and power armor helmet equipped.  Selecting the helmet unequips it independently, and selecting the armor unequips it, which immediately plays an exit power armor animation. Taking the armor off while the helmet is off puts it back on before you leave the suit.  Sounds plausible."
fo4,3dk7au,Laxian,4,Fri Jul 17 02:13:30 2015 UTC,"Well, the Pip-Boy can probably interface with the suit (I imagine that an armor as complicated as PA has its own internal computer to regulate and control it, so why not)  As for not wearing the helmet - while cool when you are in a secured area or having a conversation, I think that's too risky (as in I wouldn't do it in RL, so I won't do it in the game!) in combat (or even while exploring as a damned lucky headshot (even with a crappy worn out bolt-action-rifle) would kill you instantly, while the bullet would be deflected by the helmet in that case!)"

He's new and doesn't have that many videos yet (and some of them are pokemon, but the rest are fallout) but I would subscribe to him as I'm sure he will be making more Fallout 4 videos in the future.  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDZkdJNJMtU2J8tKmQrXv2Q  There have been many youtubers doing well reasoned discussion videos on Fallout 4, but I cannot remember any of their channels, since I only watched that one video and moved on. You could try the potluck of searching, wading through the crap is sometimes well worth it.  You know it's quite funny. Without wanting to turn this into a negative thread or derailing it, I originally enjoyed and watched a few of one of the aforementioned well-known but not well respected youtubers. It's clear that they have passion for Fallout, but for some people it seems to be so easy to stray. I know it can be easy at times to be absent-minded but it's like these people don't listen to themselves talk. When they are pulled up on their behaviour, they whine and cry that they are being picked on instead of realising and apologising for their behaviour. I'd say I'm quite forgiving, and I realise pretty much anyone can stray. The issue is doing it consistently and then not acknowledging it nor apologising for it (Yes, the person I am mentioning did apologise for not checking their facts for one of their videos, but that does not excuse the fact they have been pulling this bullshit with almost every single video they've churned out over the past month), which to me is inexcusable. It's obvious to anyone that your views will skyrocket if you use clickbait titles to a popular medium. This in turn gets you more money. Everyone likes to earn money, sure, but I would think most people would rather have integrity. I guess not though, I've seen the state of youtube and twitch. Even my favourite streamers sell their souls by using their pets to get views, follows, subs and donations. Or play into childrens egos by giving them on screen recognition for their donation or sub. You could make an argument that this is how youtube and twitch work, but I'd rather say fuck that, and fuck the rules. I'd almost certainly never make it as a youtuber or twitcher but I'd be happy in the knowledge I stood up for my beliefs.  Sorry about the wall. I don't think these people are bad people.

I mean, if you've seen the info already and Matty is posting it as new; maybe it's new to him and it may be new to some of his viewers. I mean if ABC gets the scoop on breaking news; then CBS is gonna want to get in on that news asap. They may even say the exact same dialogue that the ABC reporter did. That dose not make CBS a shit reporting network; that just makes them slow on the draw this time around.  As for times when his information is wrong/bad; we all make mistakes, we are; after all, human. This being said; Matty dose admit to not being a loremaster when it comes to the fallout universe. so if he calls Goris a supermutant, yes he's wrong; but that dose not make him satan lmao...

Combat Zone: a glimps into the seedy history in boston. It would be really neat to see thatplace featured as the den of sin much like the strip casinos Gomorrah and the Ultraluxe were in new vegas. the name would still fit if you had a bunch of off duty minute men there in uniform on their day off.

Those were NOT cities, those were like... small towns. This Boston looks like an actual City - a small City, yeah, but that's what Boston is - a small, densely packed city.

Boston has about 50 sqmi of land, and that's not considering all the other cities that form greater boston (Cambridge for example, where MIT is).  Given how they have design maps before, they'll probably go very far into the surrounding areas(maybe up to new Hampshire or rhode island) or maybe save those for dlc.  I guess the wuestion is how much are they going to balance city areas and country side.  And if they are going to make a bigger map.  Its pretty much a given they're going out to at least Lexington and Concord, which is about 16 miles.  Hopefully the world map will grow by a few square miles"

I'm a Fallout fan, sure (why else would I be here) and I hate to be a naysayer, but no matter how hard Bethesda tries, their signature game engine guarantees the game will release with a slew of bugs, every time. No matter how hard they try.  The game is set in a persistent world (literally, unlike the buzzwords DayZ wannabes and modern MMOs use), and from what I learned modding Fallout 3 you're never going to be able to optimise something like that to perfection.  For things like these, just my opinion here, better to push aside a day after release for playing so that the day one patch has time to settle into place?

Although what we saw at E3 is cut together, we know that it isn't separated by two years on account of the fact that they wear the same clothes the whole time and that the baby doesn't grow up. Also, a vault tec van outside the house doesn't move and the calendar reads October 23rd, 2077, which will be a Saturday, as Howard also said.

Till we get a direct confirmation, I would treat this info as unconfirmed.  At best, I would assume the date is right, but wouldn't expect to see but so much of little glimps of pre-war America.

fo4,3dhl7y,AngelhunterUK,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:43:28 2015 UTC,"You do only XP towards your skills, kills will just grant XP towards whatever skill was used to kill them. Also, iirc, the character level up was based on not how many times a skill was leveled but by the magnitude of how much the skill was leveled up. For example; reaching destruction magic skill of 25 didn't contribute as much character level XP as much as say leveling Lockpick to 50 but I could be remembering wrong."

fo4,3dhl7y,thm7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:53:51 2015 UTC,"I haven't played Skyrim in a while, but you don't get XP at all in that game, do you? You level when enough of your skills increase in level, and then you get to choose a perk in one skill tree depending on your skill level.   I'm guessing that FO4 will use a system similar to what 1-3 and NV have all used. Bethesda knows not to fuck around with some of the base mechanics so as not to piss off the fan base. They're probably going to tweak it a bit, but I think overall it's going to stay the same.   From what I'm gathering from the trailer, though, it looks like there will be skill checks to do a lot of things. I remember seeing something during the trailer while modding weapons, and it required a skill (or maybe several skills, like Guns and Repair) to be high enough to mod a certain weapon. Of course, that was used in NV, as well. Looks like they may have just changed the interface, but are keeping the skill system generally the same."

It makes a lot of sense to me and gets rid of the idea that my 100 science guy can make all the chems, Hack anything, and do quantum physics.  it makes more sense that the perks boost particular things letting you make actual experts that are not ludicrously over skilled in everything. Example: i played NV with like a cowboy with a revolver but for some reason i am just as good with that 6 shooter as i am with a mini-gun or a assault rifle"
fo4,3dhl7y,MSG1000,3,Thu Jul 16 15:46:17 2015 UTC,"The theory i put in another thread is similar to your first one but i don't think the skills will level up as u use them like in Elder Scrolls, Todd said in an interview long time ago (i think it was when skyrim was first announced and people were wondering if they were making skyrim more like fallout) they didn't want to to merge elder scrolls and fallouts leveling systems completely. So if they have gotten rid of skills and skill points I think (like u said) the skills will serve as tree's the perks are organized into and with each perk you pick it will raise that Skill by 1 rank (idea based on seeing energy weapon mods require Ranks in Science which is normally a skill) the other alternative is some of the skills have been made into perks (based on regular gun mods requiring Ranks in Gun Nut instead of just Gun). Hopefully they'll talk more about skills and perks at Quakecon this seem's to be one of the more interesting topics atm."
fo4,3dhl7y,gniknosmirceht,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:35:28 2015 UTC,"That's also my theory too. I think it makes the most sense with all the evidence we've seen.   There's a perk page but no skill page, there are skill requirements, but they're all very low numbers, and skill bobbleheads are still definitely in the game. It definitely seems like skills have been merged with perks somehow but not completely removed."

All options are appealing. Optional is always nice for player freedom. Required forces you to think about your building which is fun. Placed automatically is ok, because you don't have to worry about structural integrity. Pre-existing means you will have to scout for an area you want, which feels like an accomplishment.  It will most likely be optional but you never know."

If you're going to Boston in September, having not played the game and based on how little we know about it, the Duck Tour will probably be better as far as actually getting a sense of how the city is laid out. As you can see here the duck tours actually hit the same locations as those that are found on the FT, just from a distance in an amphibious WWII vehicle.

fo4,3dgtua,SuicidalNapkin09,2,Fri Jul 17 01:01:54 2015 UTC,"While most mods will be dependent upon the GECK's release, Bethesda's ESP/ESM file structure is reasonably understood, there are several non-GECK editors which will, at launch, have at least some degree of compatibility with the new versions of their files, and similar mods were available well within a week of Skyrim's launch(and yes, some of them were day 0 mods).  Now it is entirely possible I'll have to wait a week or more for this kind of mod to drop, but if you think no GECK=No mods, well that wasn't true for Fallout 3, with it's GECK launching some two months after the game, it wasn't true for Skyrim, with it's creation kit launching almost four months after the game, and the modding comunity has only gotten larger and more experienced since then.  No argument that for most mods FO4's GECK will be the best tool for the job, but it isn't the only tool modders have, and for simple changes, like altering how far a nose can be stretched or even shoved back into the skill, it isn't always necessary."

fo4,3dlcun,Kramer88,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:40:38 2015 UTC,"But grey vs grey could be described as white vs white in grand scale, a slight misstep of a faction doesnt mean that group is gray enough. like in real world also, not everyone is able of free from mistake.  To me, grey faction is completety neutral group that could described as acquiring profit as possible, but not necessary evil. kinda like a mercenary or capitalist nation that seek only profit. they never have an intention to bring good or bad to wasteland.  unlike grey vs gray, in White vs White You need to choose between greater Good and be ready to feel guilty if its clear that the faction you didn't  choose are just  misunderstanded, their intention is benelovent at all. in short word, white vs white is a situation where both side are unambiguously benelovent  oh, since  the fallout 4 setting will be more lighter and softer compared to Fallout 3, i really want this to be happen since i want to run into situation like ""can we just get Along?

fo4,3dlcun,Eissa_Cozorav,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:07:15 2015 UTC,"True, but personally I've always preferred making a really difficult choice. If it's white/white, they're both good choices at the end of the day.  Also, as for grey, I always felt like (in games) its less ""I'm doing good, and if I make some $ along the way, even better."" Rather, I've always thought of that like I'm trying to make some money, I'm looking out for myself, but hey if it helps other people out by just a bonus.  Tl;Dr: I'm a fairly cynical, and think happy endings belong in disney movies  Although, I guess I'm pretty cynical. I don't think I would ever have an issue helping either of the two sides with white / white because at the end of the day, if the ultimate purpose is to do good, they're not going to be making a whole lot of bad choices. With grey / grey you might be doing half the fucking planet... To ensure that the other half lives a very nice life. Or maybe, the other people want to help everyone, but no one's going to have that great of a life. And then you're not only getting to talk to you in the people involved, you also and factoring in their children. Their kids will have that killed a future generation has that.

fo4,3dlcun,Kramer88,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:29:47 2015 UTC,"Depends on perspective; NCR could be ""bad guy"", because the instablility they created with over expansionist policy and weak law when dealing with criminal. the same goes with legion.  In fallout 3, IMO contrary to popular view, the lyon's BoS is not actually complete white. to me, their mutant-hating views is inferior if they wanted to be sort of wasteland protector. they just like another enclave that seek eradicate mutated individual, only less extreme. this is contrast with NCR, who allow ghoul to be incorporated in their nation, with no discrimination abuse.  lastly, this is new world, where bad things doesn't seems to be like in the old world"
fo4,3dlcun,Eissa_Cozorav,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:56:36 2015 UTC,"Tl;Dr: it was still painfully clear who where the intended ""good guys"" in NV, amd fo3 (although im replaying NV atm, so more referencing that)   Yeah,  it in FO3 the majority of mutes /where/ bad. There was no jacobstown (albiet, NCR clearly didn't enjoy the fact that NV had jacobstown) but it's still just a little too clear who the ""good guy"" is. I wouldn't imagine it'd be easy to make a case that the legion is morally superior to NCR. NCR isn't actively hurting people, even if they're spreading themselves too thin, this isn't necessarily bad. They only /need/ to be able to somewhat fortify a given town, after all, as the citizens will still put up a fight with NCR (so basically free guns) plus it allows people to accept NCR having them spread all over, this increasing recruitment. It's a necessary first step at any attempt to bring law and order back in.. Then you have the legion, who want to bring order to it's knees, and do.. Yeah,I never was too clear on what their goals where honestly.. But they clearly had no quarrels with slavery/murder, soo.."

Would be really great if there were some smaller vents/crawlspaces you could only get through by crawling, leaving more ways to effectively sneak past various NPCs.

Instead of being blocked my a chest or head high crate you can grab the edge and pull yourself up to go over it, or maybe work your way from there over to a window for a quieter entry. It would also mean having the base animations for grabbing an edge if you don't quite make a particular jump, which means more viable paths for the player to take in completing various objectives and, assuming the AI is properly made aware of them, more ways for unique NPCs to surprise the player."
fo4,3dgw51,Sehvekah,5,Thu Jul 16 23:33:39 2015 UTC,"While I wouldn't mind this being in the game, I do doubt it will be. Crouching as a feature in Fo3 was more for sneaking than a utility to aid in accurate shooting. While going prone would certainly also aid in sneaking of course, having a tiered system for sneaking, as I would expect going prone to provide more to your sneak ability than crouching, it would probably just complicate things overall. But I do agree it would add to the immersion and fun for a sniper character."

If not, I'd say New Vegas for the reasons you mentioned above. Though it wasn't made by Bethesda and stays a bit more true to the original Fallout games than Fo3 and presumably Fo4, it does have the mechanics. Weapon mods, perks like Jury Rigging, etc etc. Plus it's easier to create a roleplay scenario, since the game takes place four years after the events of Fo3/presumably Fo4 and you could justify how the Sole Survivor got from Boston to the Mojave in that amount of time."

But it's disheartening, BC despite FO being just... Fucking amazing, and having female players for.. Idk, how long. (Haven't played but 3/NV)  it's still something that, in the industry, merits being mentioned. And that honestly makes me a little.. Sad? Not really.. But annoyed, I guess.

If it's a choice based on their demographics or that they create the footage from someone who plays the game and that person chose to be a guy. I'm curious about if there is a decision at all. I'm secretly hoping that TES VI uses a woman because that would be a nice change.
fo4,3dk4fy,Palatyibeast,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:58:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly I've never felt like the gender of the protagonist of a game affected my interest in playing it? But I know I can't speak for everyone, and obviously it might be different for games where you can craft your player character, since some people will try and style it after themselves. But at the same time, people know there will be male and female options going into a game like Fallout, so it's not like the audience needs to be informed in promotional material that yes, we have scruffy white men. Expanding the representation can only do good and at no cost.  Also honestly I think a female character for the Atom Bomb Baby montage would have been much more apropos but that's whatever."
fo4,3dk4fy,maxedouttoby,5,Thu Jul 16 23:53:03 2015 UTC,"To me its about immersion really. A lot of the time I put myself in the characters shoes and pretend I am actually living in these worlds, so being forced to play a woman can completely put me off a game. Its not a sexist thing, I just like to be able to imagine the character as me, which is impossible to do if the character is a woman (hell, even black characters are a little off puting to me if its a 3rd person game).  I've definitely skipped out on a few games due to a female protagonist (tomb raider, infamous first light and I have no intention of picking up horizon: zero dawn either)."
fo4,3dk4fy,Kramer88,4,Fri Jul 17 00:19:44 2015 UTC,You are 100% allowed to feel that way.  But does that make it easier to realise why people who aren't white males might feel the same? That the white-male default might be putting off people and shaping the demographics of gamers?
fo4,3dk4fy,Accrudant,4,Fri Jul 17 11:36:10 2015 UTC,"Oh I wasn't saying that white males should be the standard! I was just explaining why some people might not enjoy games when the character you play as doesn't look like or represent how you look in real life.  I'm not angry at games that have female lead roles, I'm happy theres more diversity actually. It just means that, I, personally, won't be picking up the game. Thats my problem, not the game's."

fo4,3dk4fy,Kramer88,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:24:20 2015 UTC,I really really hate saying this but male seems to be the default because its safe. By leading off female you're walking into a field of landmines. the second you start trying to show off character customization you have to fear being accused of objectifying a pixel of a woman (what so you think women with unibrows are unattractive why are you adjusting her body type or bust size you perv!)  which clearly means you're some sort of manbearpig with unclean thoughts. next thing you know the Politically correct nazis are calling for boy... I mean personcotts  as protesters with pitchforks and torches are calling for resignations. It sucks I would have loved to have seen that done with the female protagonist but I can't fault them for playing it safe. If there is anything to be learned from this it's that the war of the sexes still rages on over stupid things and war... war never changes.
fo4,3dk4fy,TheHeroicOnion,4,Fri Jul 17 04:17:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly the fact that female protagonists could be seen as even remotely risky is even more reason to push for more of them. Women need to be normalized as main characters in the industry. And games like Fallout where the player can choose their PC's gender are good candidates for stressing that representation.  I don't quite understand how merely showing a woman in character customization could be interpreted as objectifying unless the demo pilot did something blatant that they wouldn't have done with a man. For those who advocate increased representation of women and other minority groups in games, inclusion can only be lauded. Exactly how a character is used once they're being included is what can and should be scrutinized, but that's true about any character regardless of gender."
fo4,3dk4fy,Kramer88,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:33:27 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with you the problem is the people ""leading the charge"" as it were are the same people profiting by drawing the us and them lines that keep everyone divided. people just need to wake up and realize when some of these people start ranting about nothing they should be told to piss off.

Also interviews do not translate well into text. You either just provide a transcript which is not really doing your job as a writer, or you try to translate the responses into something you can print.  You can also sometimes just end up with an interviewer who isn't good, I've heard of multiple people sometimes getting half way through an interview and just telling the interviewer ""You know what, I'm going to hang up the phone and write some questions and answers and just send them to you."""

And despite me using it mainly on deathclaws i also used it on other things as well (even relearned why you don't poison machines and animals with there own venom). I do believe it should return but tone it down a bit. Maybe make it do DOT type damage like the nightstalkers n radscorpions in FNV. Or maybe cripple one limb after a direct hit (or multiple hits) to the limb. I say limb because i will agree its kinda BS that you cripple legs despite the fact that u shot them in the torso or head or even the arm. Plus if we were to go for real poison i don't think there is one that causes immediate paralyze in the legs. Still for those saying that it was way OP and that it should not come back remember you had to build it and no one sold it nor carried it. So meaning that you didn't have to use it.

Bloodbug venom would be a stacking DoT, as the anti-coagulant leaves the victim bleeding faster with each hit. Mirelurk venom/Ghoul Blood adds RADs with each hit, and a stacking Rads over Time debuff. Bloatfly sludge would create a slow/disorientation with DoT.

fo4,3de0lm,molestro,3,Wed Jul 15 15:44:34 2015 UTC,"Tldr: the nomad life's for me. Tiny compounds with all the essentials when I'm not out wandering.  I'll probably just do what I always do, smallest place possible with as much of the essentials for crafting/storage/commerce as possible and as close to the places I need that can't be part of my home. Like the home in Whiterun, Megaton, and the hotel room in Novac. Drop in, dump the important shit, sell the other shit, repair what's left, and then move out. I always try to be a nomad essentially. I don't care what my house looks like I just need enough separate storage units to OCD sort out all my junk so I know which dresser/locker/safe to go to when I need to get something for a specific task. I always try to keep under 50-60 pounds of gear when traveling in a Bethesda game so I can clear out every map marker as I work grid by grid across the map and soak in the world and characters and all the handy loot. With the Honest Hearts dlc, Joshua Graham was a great character but he had the best gear I could ever want with my nomad style of play. His armor, his pistol, a silent sniper rifle, Love and Hate, and a small compliment of meds/chems/food and I could stay under 40 pounds of gear with a little over 300 pounds of carrying capacity. I'd go weeks of real life without needing to go home because I only take the loot that's got an efficient price to weight ratio and sell off stuff as I make my way to the next town. With the settlement system in 4 I'll mess around with it a little bit but unless there's things I can only get from it I probably won't dive too deep into it. If I can make a tiny compound with all the stuff I need I'll just blanket the outskirts with traps and turrets and hope everything hasn't gone pear-shaped by the time I come back around."
fo4,3de0lm,aukalender,0,Wed Jul 15 19:31:17 2015 UTC,dont think many people pick up empty sunset sarsaparilla bottles and sit at home for days so everyone plays the same I guess
fo4,3de0lm,molestro,2,Wed Jul 15 22:42:39 2015 UTC,"In Fallout 3, early on I kept to a habit of my grid by grid fast travel unlocking and general area clearing of all enemies and loot. I also stuck to fast traveling back to home base, ferreting away my loot like the filthy hoarder I was then, and sleeping to get that well rested bonus. I would call it a day once I had the well rested bonus expire so I'd finish what I was doing and head back home to sleep again. By the time I finished up 3 and moved on to New Vegas I had developed a style of only taking things that were worth taking to hoard or sell. Nuka Colas and ammo were my best friends when it came to getting quick caps. I used to pick up every thing that in my head would have made sense to be useful even though I knew it said the item weighed as much as it was worth only to find it the things couldn't be used or were used for something I didn't need with that character. Once I learned what was and wasn't of value my entire habits of play started to change and slowly my home began to serve an even smaller role in my wasteland lifestyle. In 4 we'll be getting a settlement system. I just assume since it's been announced there will be raider attacks on your settlement that there will most likely be different factors that influence the likelihood of being raided. Size of settlement, number of inhabitants, value of settlement assets, etc. In my mind, if I'm the raiding hordes I'd go for the smallest settlements with the shiniest shit. Lower risk, higher reward... Makes sense right? If in this situation I can still make the smallest and easiest to access stronghold with all the bells and whistles of the big boys I will. I just hope that I don't have to keep running back all the time to manage it and fight off invaders like trying to control the city blocks in Saints Row. Still, the empty bottles plan does sound like a lovely plan. I mean it's worked out so well for old No-Bark Noonan so well."

I find that screen odd though, since I was fairly certain that when an NPC equipped a certain type of armor, they adopted the DT.  Anyway, it should definitely be accurate, in my opinion.

fo4,3debaa,kaptiansimian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:02:58 2015 UTC,with both vast and a layered armor system now would be the perfect time to implement this. You could start picking your shots based on perceived weak points instead of just aiming to disable legs will slow them down if I cripple them there but they have a higher armor value there could shoot the left arm for pure damage(unarmored) but won't inhibit the enemy who's slinging a pistol in the right hand.

I can't even explain it very well, but it's one of those distinct rifle sounds that you might hear on a 50 cal turret, but it's not a 50 cal...  Here, it's like this sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLJQKFi6kG0  Point is, this is probably one of THE most ideal firing rates for low ammo situations, as it allows for quick response without having to spam the trigger, but it doesn't let you waste your clip in a second.  Here's another version of it... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7BPrWqJKuY Still can't find the actual rifle I'm looking for though."

fo4,3dcx1h,StanDough,2,Wed Jul 15 10:00:43 2015 UTC,"Simply put, it just makes sense to finally have different fire rate options because that's just how guns are.    In game, I think this could really diversify the pace of different combat scenarios.    For example, you could be on a roof trying to steadily pick a guy off when all of the sudden, a bunch of raiders run up the stairs behind you, so you need to switch to an automatic mode to quickly tear them down from close range."
fo4,3dcx1h,The_Radscorpion,2,Wed Jul 15 14:42:10 2015 UTC,"It's confirmed that, at least in the case of some guns, the firing mode is determined by the receiver. The assault rifle apparently has the Automatic Receiver mod which renders it fully automatic. Side note, this probably means its semiautomatic standard. Take that as you will, but I want to believe it's because automatic fire is a more potent option this time around."

fo4,3d8z88,Byepolerbare,4,Wed Jul 15 04:00:49 2015 UTC,"If the game didn't have a first person or third person shooter mechanic attached to it, I'd agree with you. Fallout is not a pure RPG. It's an amalgam that incorporates RPG elements with some FPS elements as well (albeit not as well as other ""FPSRPGs"" a la Borderlands).  Besides, guns skill will probably factor in scope sway and things like that to compensate for the lack of skill points."

In a normal first person shooter, holding breath is one of my favorite actions, but in a RPG like Fallout it seems to make Gun/EW skills less relevant (only increased damage + QoL?)  In the other hand, the apparent lack of skills in the game suggests that they remade the whole system, so maybe it won't be that bad.  One thing is for sure, the fans of isometric classic Fallout will hate this."

fo4,3d8z88,tveli,-7,Tue Jul 14 17:14:24 2015 UTC,well thats just poor shooting.
fo4,3d8z88,Mister-Sinister,6,Tue Jul 14 14:56:27 2015 UTC,"well thats just poor shooting.   No.  You hold your breath right before you fire so that you may greatly reduce trembling, breathing sways, movement...  Now you understand."
fo4,3d8z88,PoCult7,-4,Tue Jul 14 16:40:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah thats not true... you fire between breaths right after an exhale, you never hold your breath to fire."
fo4,3d8z88,Mister-Sinister,7,Tue Jul 14 16:55:11 2015 UTC,"A five second google search says this:   Breath control is of the utmost importance for the sniper. The movement made by the expansion and contraction of the chest cavity during a shot could easily throw a snipers aim off. In order for a sniper to make his shot, he is required to stop breathing for during the natural pause between inhalation and exhalation and make his shot. The natural pause between breaths is usually two or three seconds long. By extending this pause to ten seconds, a sniper has the window he needs to make his shot. Firing should always occur during this forced pause, when the diaphragm and breathing muscles are relaxed. If the sniper does not settle enough to make his shot, the relaxation process is repeated.  This respiratory pause should not be forced or too long. Holding your breath too long results in involuntary movement of the body. Ten seconds is the assumed time limit to make a good shot while holding your breath during the natural pause between breaths. Even after the shot is made, breathing is still important during the follow through. Snipers are trained to keep their muscles relaxed and their breathing regular and steady after the shot.   http://www.ghilliesuitsonline.com/brteforsn.html"
fo4,3d8z88,PoCult7,-5,Tue Jul 14 17:00:31 2015 UTC,"in the military when they teach you to shoot you are taught to keep slow calm breathing.  The line you're ignoring is ""This respiratory pause should not be forced or too long.""  holding your breath deprives your muscles of oxygen and causes you to start shaking.  Yes you can have a long pause between the exhale and the inhale by being calm you take less breaths and your heart isn't racing, holding your breath is just bad fundamentals, go shooting for real and try some different techniques. i'm sure it might work for one or two people but generally speaking its bad form, but hey for a video game i'm sure its fine."
fo4,3d8z88,Mister-Sinister,2,Tue Jul 14 17:24:17 2015 UTC,"You take steady measured breaths. The weapon should rise and fall slightly in front of you, changing the sight picture slightly. As the sights align on the target, you pause your breathing for a second or two, so that everything is perfectly still, and you take the shot. That's how you 'hold your breath' when shooting."
fo4,3d8z88,Mr_Evil_MSc,-6,Tue Jul 14 18:11:10 2015 UTC,I have used this technique while shooting.  I've also tried your method.  Guess which technique allowed me to hit more?
fo4,3d8z88,PoCult7,-2,Tue Jul 14 17:32:23 2015 UTC,"then congrats on being a special snowflake, like I said it can work for some people but not the general masses, especially if you're shooting any large amount.

fo4,3d8z88,Mister-Sinister,2,Tue Jul 14 17:11:41 2015 UTC,"If you aren't breathing (inhaling or exhaling), then you're holding your breath. Or you're dead."

fo4,3d8z88,PoCult7,-2,Tue Jul 14 19:17:47 2015 UTC,"You've clearly never fired a gun in your life (at least accurately).  In sniping, the shooter will find a comfortable position to lay prone and rest the weapon. They'll remain in that position for a few minutes, gradually slowing their breathing (NOT holding their breath. Large inhales/exhales). Once their breathing slows down, so to does their heart rate, they then rest their trigger finger on the trigger (if not already rested there) and wait for the blood to rush to it, that way they can feel their heartbeat against the trigger. They'd fire as they exhale and between heartbeats to minimize any possible movement.  (Source: This is how USMC Scout Snipers are instructed. I am not one myself but have seen enough information, both on weaponry and tactics, to know it's either done how I just explained of very similarly)  Edit: Downvoted for pointing out facts. 10/10 f04 sub-reddit is best sub-reddit."

Flick up VATs and choose to whack, cool animation plays. Not really an indication of fun to play combat."

They seem to react to where it hits in a relatively realistic way. They didn't have that, in the NV or FO3 VATS animations. Using VATS with a melee weapon usually just meant that you'd hit the person and they'd slide backwards."
fo4,3dbi74,CheshireHyena,3,Wed Jul 15 01:58:43 2015 UTC,"My point wasn't against the animation. It's kinda like the Deus Ex Human Revolution takedowns. Press button, cutscene like thing happens.   Cool visuals and all but it makes for jarring gameplay. Sure it's nice looking but does it make for fun play?   I'd be more impressed with a proper combo you have to execute which stunlocks your opponent before culminating in a cool head smashing execution attack. Then I can be sure, yeah I can personally perform cool melee stuff by myself."
fo4,3dbi74,Donnie-G,2,Wed Jul 15 02:47:41 2015 UTC,"I think that those shots were probably taken from VATS, for a more cinematic effect. I don't think that it's locked only to VATS though.

At one point, the PC was shooting a ghoul and with every shot, it was flinching with the bullet. Also, at another point, the PC was shooting an android in the face with a gun that was full-auto. The head was bobbing back with every shot and pieces of the face were being ripped off."

Just wish you could get a critical without it unless something really cool happens (hate my game stopping to show that, yes, a shotgun to the face blew said face off..)"
fo4,3dbi74,Kramer88,0,Wed Jul 15 04:59:04 2015 UTC,"The thing is, it looks like dynamic physics-based animation, maybe the bats was a critical or kill cam like in skyrim, but the female ghoul reacts to the shots where they hit, not with a predetermined knockback animation, and the pistol whip definitely looks like havok at play. Rewatching it, I don't think any of that stuff happens in vats or a slowmotion kill cam."

fo4,3dbi74,AstralVoidShaper,2,Wed Jul 15 00:08:21 2015 UTC,I think a great feature would be assassination animations when you sneak up on a person for a sneak attack critical. Skurim would do it every so often but i think it would be a great feature to have all the time for stealth play

It's easy to edit together a trailer and make it look like animations have smoothed out while still having shitty animations.   Really, I wouldn't mind either way. If it's slightly improved over FO3 I will be happy. Personally I'm not a guy that plays these games for the combat, but I can see why other people would want the animations and everything to be as smooth and crisp as possible."
fo4,3dbi74,PoCult7,6,Wed Jul 15 00:21:36 2015 UTC,Just look at the shot of the dog biting a guy and ripping out his flesh. Pretty convincing animation I'd say.

It's far from perfect, but good enough that I noticed how much they had improved it. Now I won't constantly be thinking about how crap everything looks, and instead only be distracted every once in a while by some character sliding a bit too much. All in all, it looks pretty good."
fo4,3dbi74,LoneWolfe2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:35:34 2015 UTC,"Not sure, I'm torn between Skyrim and FO3. Neither is exactly great, but both certainly have some extremely satisfying parts to them.  I still recall the first time I ever exploded a head in VATS and it being goddamn glorious... but once you get to the point where VATS kills become routine then the combat is really just functional with a bit of satisfying crunch.  Skyrim's combat on the other hand, well it is certainly the best of the Elder Scrolls games in that arena but again it is simply functional as opposed to enjoyable."

fo4,3dbi74,manofsea,2,Wed Jul 15 19:13:43 2015 UTC,"FO3's guns and things used a combination of basic sounds, which give it a kind of multi-layer sound. I think FO4 may have more advanced sounds. Same audio guy however."

And you had colourful shopkeepers such as Renesco. And you could arm wrestle a mutant and wake up with a ball gag.   Fallout 3 was very very dry in comparison. It just didn't know how to take the piss.
fo4,3dchun,meditations-,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:38:38 2015 UTC,"And you could arm wrestle a mutant and wake up with a ball gag.   Man, I miss the old Fallout games.  But yes, this is my #1 complaint with FO3. Bethesda does tend to take itself too seriously."
fo4,3dchun,aisforargon,3,Thu Jul 16 07:53:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean by 'classic perks' and 'variety of companions'. Would you like to elaborate?

fo4,3dchun,aisforargon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:58:54 2015 UTC,"In Fallout 2 you could have a companion for pretty much everything sentient you encounter. Dog, Ghoul, Super Mutant, Robot, robotic dog, slave, Deathclaw, and average human.  In total, there are about 10 different companions not counting the permanent ""joke"" companions. (like the ones from the shotgun wedding and the pariah dog)  I'd also like to see the return of some older enemies like the wanamingos if possible."
fo4,3dchun,A_Talking_Tree,9,Wed Jul 15 05:14:04 2015 UTC,"To be fair, 3 and Vegas covers all of those except for the Deathclaw. Dog is Dogmeat, a ghoul in 3 and NV, Super Mutant in 3 and NV, Robot in 3 and NV (an Eyebot and a Mr Gutsy, both with personalities), robotic dog in NV, slave in 3, an 'average human' for both.   I hope they keep some of the 'classic' enemies but I also don't mind room for innovation. I like the idea of different breeds being prevalent in different areas of thhe country."
fo4,3dchun,Aronboli,5,Wed Jul 15 05:35:54 2015 UTC,And there are mods that add a deathclaw follower atleast in new vegas and im guessing fo3 too
fo4,3dchun,Aronboli,4,Wed Jul 15 15:42:52 2015 UTC,"Well, the deathclaw wasn't a permanent companion. Also Bethesda hasn't messed around with intelligent Deathclaws, so we can't assume they'll be in the game."

I get the feeling it's a nod to the idea that Deathclaws are not entirely feral. If there's a place like that in FO3 I haven't found it, so maybe BethS hasn't weighed in officially."

fo4,3dchun,GeneralBonobo,3,Thu Jul 16 07:54:43 2015 UTC,"The only things I've really seen so far that reflect the style of the original games are that power armor really makes you nearly invulnerable to small arms fire, and the style of the vault suit. We really just haven't seen enough yet. There'll be more to pick apart after QuakeCon, and we might even see some footage, somehow.  We have seen that you can get a super mutant companion, though. Possibly only temporary, but we'll see."
fo4,3dchun,GeneralBonobo,3,Wed Jul 15 05:15:02 2015 UTC,Hopefully it won't be as goofy. Realistically it will be the most similar to Fallout 3. Same team and everything. Which is fine with me although New Vegas is my favorite in the series.
fo4,3dchun,VNIVIXV,2,Thu Jul 16 02:24:13 2015 UTC,"From what we've seen so far, it probably wont be really any similar to Fallout 2. First you have completely different core mechanics, FO1/2 were top down turn based RPGs, FO4 places emphasis on being more of an action rpg shooter. There's also the fact that skill points are gone and integrated into the SPECIAL stats and Perk System instead. You have a layered armor system like earlier Elder Scrolls games rather than just a one item armor like past FO games. You've got a voiced protagonist and a dialogue wheel rather than a list of things you can select to talk about. There's also the fact that the setting is on the east coast rather than the west coast, so you wont be in a familiar setting like in NV. Bethesda probably wont touch upon the mature themes of FO2 either.  All in all, FO2 and FO4 are two entirely different games within the same universe. If you like action RPGs and shooters, and love the Fallout universe, then this ought not bother you too much. But if you're looking for a game like FO2 then FO4 wont be anything like it. I personally like both styles so it doesn't really bother me."
fo4,3dchun,sp0tless,0,Wed Jul 15 18:24:01 2015 UTC,That doesn't sound like what I wanted at all... Dang. I hope we can see Fallout return to its roots sometime in the future.
fo4,3dchun,CheshireHyena,2,Wed Jul 15 19:29:34 2015 UTC,"As long as Bethesda owns the Fallout IP it's very unlikely. I mean I'm fine with it, like I said, I like both versions."

fo4,3dchun,Kiyoko504,2,Thu Jul 16 00:40:19 2015 UTC,"It won't be similar at all. Since FO3, fallout games become something else. I don't treat FO3 and NV same as FO1/2. They are completly diffrent games. For me FO3 and NV were post-nuclear-open world-roam around simulator while FO1/2 where true, deep cRPG. All through I like all of fallout games."
fo4,3dchun,MSG1000,2,Wed Jul 15 11:47:45 2015 UTC,"To me, FO2 (never played 1, due to it not wanting to work on my pc) was a lot more mature than FO3 or NV. NV came closer to 2's level of maturity, but didn't quite hit it. I'd like to see that aspect back in 4."

fo4,3dgrkw,qsts,2,Thu Jul 16 05:42:47 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to remind people not to take the flow of events in the demo as set in stone, all we have to do is look at Skyrim as an example of how Bethesda twists events and areas in demos to show off what they want at that time regardless of how the finished product will be. For all we know the event with Garvey doesn't feature Power Armor at all but the dialogue is there because its used later as part of another quest, I have no basis to prove this either way right now (Just cautious skeptisim based on skyrims demo lol) so only time will tell once we have the actual game."
fo4,3dgrkw,DrakonLitshed,0,Thu Jul 16 13:10:18 2015 UTC,"If this reveal happened in 2014, I would agree with you. But this occurred less than 5 months before the release. It's very unlikely for any have company to show a completely different experience than what customers will see come release this close to the date. Content and Story for a game like this was most assuredly locked down months ago if not probably last year. Development time spent making a fake game intro to a game 4 months away is both a waste of time and a terrible thing to do to the customer if you want to sell a game. I have no doubt that when we boot up the game in November, it'll look and play almost identical to this. Obviously there will be more, as the footage is clearly edited, but that's most likely for time and efficiency to show the major points of the game off as quickly as possible."
fo4,3dgrkw,DrakonLitshed,2,Thu Jul 16 14:53:05 2015 UTC,"Again, Skyrim, gameplay revealed at E3 2011, game released Nov 2011. A lot of differences between the two, hell as close as about just 2 months before launch Vampires we're hinted at being very different being more agile and having a more supernatural feel, smooth seductive taunts, pristine beautiful apperances, playfull and cat like movements, game came out and they're exactly how they were in oblivion. And this is the same team that made skyrim and its gameplay demos, they've had plenty of time to piece these demos together as they tested gameplay through the many versions to show what they want and we're not talking massive changes yet, the footage was definitely edited and was most likely taken from a previous builds of the game that have been changed since, they chose that footage because it ran smoothly and showed what they wanted."
fo4,3dgrkw,aisforargon,0,Thu Jul 16 15:12:32 2015 UTC,"But that gameplay reveal was just some gameplay from the early part of the game. They made no claim that it was the start of the game. They didn't show off the character creation with a complete story and character introduction. It makes no sense to make this E3 showcase different than how the game will start, especially since Todd explicitly stated that this was the start of the game. What is the benefit of lying about that 4 months before the game comes out. Skyrim had no such claim and all you're arguing is that you disagree with how they hinted at their version of vampires?  Watch the E3 showcase, and tell me he isn't telling the audience that this the how the game starts, he is. Then think about everything he talks about as if he's misdirecting everyone. It makes no sense. Just actually think about it. Don't let your cynicism take over. Don't act like it's a conspiracy. Watch it and think about it."
fo4,3dgrkw,kwertyuiop,4,Thu Jul 16 15:59:55 2015 UTC,"Because the Power Armor is one of the classic pieces of the franchise, it's regarded as the most powerful (though, ehhhh), and it was one of the most badass pieces in the E3 presentation.  Not to mention in the previous games it's sort of been a mixture of vague 'EH, SOMEONE'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO USE IT SONNY' and now that we've got a really good idea that you'll probably be military-related somehow, it's cool to think that there might be some sort of flashback. There's a lot of lore surrounding Power Armor. It's basically the reason why America won the war.  Not to mention that, eh, we don't have a lot of things that are confirmed to talk about at this point.

Perhaps they might be handling it correctly like in Fallout where there were only 2 suits of power armour you could obtain, unlike Fallout 3 where there was so much power armour littering the place you could barely move without hitting one and you would would have been able to scavenge a set within the first 5 hours and made the game balance completely broken (Fallout 3 in a nutshell)."
fo4,3dgrkw,SWJS1,17,Thu Jul 16 05:16:11 2015 UTC,"We need to stop saying 100% when it's not 100% and it's not confirmed by Bethesda. The only thing 100% is something confirmed by Todd Howard or Pete Hines. That's about it.   I don't think it's going to be 2075, either, but I don't have definitive proof, and I am not 100%. My least favorite thing about this subreddit is the horrible hyperbole."
fo4,3dgrkw,SWJS1,-6,Thu Jul 16 04:06:42 2015 UTC,Except we do have proof it's not starting in 2075 as Todd stated the game starts on this day and the calender clearly reads October 2077.
fo4,3dgrkw,SWJS1,8,Thu Jul 16 04:16:15 2015 UTC,"Implying that developers never lie to keep something a secret/surprise. Not to mention that the demo obviously skips various parts of the intro, you can see that the footage was cut in several places. Nora mentions the Veteran's Hall, and going by the Kotaku leak which has been verified as reliable the player character delivers a speech about war, which likely happens at the Veteran's Hall. The character creation up until that point could easily take place before Shaun is even born. Todd Howard also stated they weren't spoiling any story stuff, and given the fact the E3 footage was pre recorded and heavily edited it's audacious to assume the E3 demo shows the pre-war section in its entirety. We likely only got to see a fraction of what is actually playable."

fo4,3dgrkw,MisterFunktastic,0,Thu Jul 16 06:12:15 2015 UTC,"Also, you see the October 2077 calender, before you see the Vault-Tec employee and Shaun. And he asks the employee if they'll have room for his entire family. That wording strongly implies the baby is there. You wouldn't say ""entire family"" if you were only talking about your wife."
fo4,3dgrkw,SWJS1,2,Thu Jul 16 16:28:24 2015 UTC,"The 2077 Calendar could just be the only art asset for calendars that they have since that calendar would be all over the wasteland for the bulk of the game. Though I'm not sure what your point here is, since it's pretty obvious that section of the game does take place when Shaun is born. That still doesn't mean there aren't entire sections of the prologue edited out to not only save time but avoid spoiling the entire thing."
fo4,3dgrkw,BwillsAlwight,0,Thu Jul 16 18:02:07 2015 UTC,"Sure, but that doesn't mean there will be random time jumps from 2075 to the October 2077. Also, I work in QA at a game developer. Stuff like this calendar would have been caught and bugged and any developer worth their stuff would try to be accurate, especially since your character is walking around interacting with these items."
fo4,3dgrkw,mrhobo1012,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:37:58 2015 UTC,"So what you think is you'll create your character in the bathroom, and then there will be a two year jump between then and when he walks into the kitchen. The most likely reason for the cuts is reading for time and perfection of the scene. They most likely edited together multiple attempts to get a good flow and time down. Todd said they would not be spoiling the story after they showed this section. My interpretation is that he's talking about all the vault stuff, which makes sense.  Everyone here is making up a lot more in order to justify something invented by the community based on a typo."
fo4,3dgrkw,internet_user999,2,Thu Jul 16 14:11:24 2015 UTC,"Todd also stated that they wanted to have enough game time set in the pre-war section to give a sense of loss when exiting the vault. The entire sense of loss angle has been stated by him verbatim more than one, and he's been very adamant in driving it home that they want it to have a large impact. Ten minutes of wake up, eat breakfast, check on dynamic baby and then having the bombs fall wouldn't be adequate to convey that sense of loss, logically we'd need to experience a significat portion of pre-war life. The prologue for Fallout 3 spanned 19 years before the game begins proper, it's not hard to believe we'd spend two years in the pre-war era before the game begins proper.  You're grasping at straws and relying on hyperbole to try and write-off what you believe is a typo, but you don't know anymore than anybody else does. There's evidence stacked for this theory as much as there is against it. 'Todd said this' isn't much of a confirmation either since Todd says a lot of things, not many of them true and some on purpose. One constant he's said is they want the player to experience the feeling of loss when exiting the vault. To do that, we need ample time to be aquainted with the pre-war era, and looking back at Fallout 3 it doesn't make sense that Bethesda would try and convey such in a day when the Fallout 3 prologue spanned 19 years. 2 years is hardly a stretch.  The pre-war era would also serve as a perfect tutorial for speech, barter and interactions. Playing as Nora? Go to the grocery store to buy groceries, haggle with a cashier. There's way too much potential there to just assume they drop us into the section of the game everyone's excited for only to have it last no longer than ten minutes."
fo4,3dgrkw,vraleigh,-1,Thu Jul 16 17:58:20 2015 UTC,"Wow, you are delusional. You have no evidence, and you can't see how illogical any of your argument is and you're trying to claim that I'm grasping at straws? It is hard to believe we'll spend two years fucking around in the pre-war area, because that's awful design. Nobody wants to meander in a pre-war world for an hour. You want to get to the game, and staging some random flashback for some sprinkling of combat makes no sense. if that happens at all, it would happen in the vault, before you emerge and embark on your grand adventure.  Why on earth would this random article from the UK have the scoop that the game starts in 2075. They don't state anything about it beyond one sentence. They just wrote the year wrong.  It's so obvious that it's a typo I'm flabbergasted as to why anyone would believe it. Except to invent their own reasons and explanations and then wish they were true.  Everything I've stated comes from direct information you can see and still you hypocritically say to me that I'm grasping at straws?  Wow. Everything you have claimed is a complete invention and you only believe it because it came from your own expectations and not from anything that came from what we know.  I guarantee the game starts exactly where Todd said it does, although probably with an intro video to showcase the theme and tone and to set the stage as is the norm with Bethesda and Fallout games. Foggy mirror, create character, wander the house, vault-tec, shaun, maybe check a couple of other things around the house some more, news cast, vault run and then the rest of the prologue involving the vault will occur, go to cry-sleep, wake-up, wander vault, emerge. That last half is of course speculation, but it's not unreasonable to think it will play out that way."
fo4,3dgrkw,vraleigh,2,Thu Jul 16 18:33:53 2015 UTC,"Wow, you are delusional.   Very classy.   It is hard to believe we'll spend two years fucking around in the pre-war area, because that's awful design.   Time skip. Ever heard of them? Obviously you would have, since, again, Fallout 3 spans 19 years and uses them heavily.   Nobody wants to meander in a pre-war world for an hour.   Speak for yourself. Though who said it had to be an hour? Fallout 3's prologue was about 30 minutes. Again, spanned 19 years. 2 years for pre-war would not be implausible.   Why on earth would this random article from the UK have the scoop that the game starts in 2075. They don't state anything about it beyond one sentence. They just wrote the year wrong. It's so obvious that it's a typo I'm flabbergasted as to why anyone would believe it. Except to invent their own reasons and explanations and then wish they were true.   Different news sources can contain different details depending on what questions they ask and how. Todd could have purposely stated 2075 to telegraph because he didn't think anyone would read it, or accidentally let it slip. There are many reasons.   Everything I've stated comes from direct information   Everything you've stated is an edjucated guess based off heavily edited pre-recorded footage at best. Injerjected with a lot of 'Todd said.' Todd says ""What's great about fallout is the world that existed before the Bombs fell and thats Where our game starts. On a beautiful Saturday Morning with the threat of Nuclear War looming."" No specific date. There were logically many beautiful saturday mornings with the threat of nuclear war looming, since nations don't just randomly decide ""Y'know what? A chinese man looked at me funny this morning, let's nuke the whole goddamn planet.""  Again, there's plenty of evidence stacked for this theory. If you turn out to be right I'll happily admit I'm wrong, but until then I'm going to continue playing devil's advocate."
fo4,3dgrkw,Murranji,0,Thu Jul 16 19:04:16 2015 UTC,"First off, you're the one claiming I'm grasping at straws when you can't even give any evidence or admit you're basing your assumptions off of further speculation.  FO3 having Time Skips doesn't = Fallout 4 having them. Fallout 3's character creation was only 10 minutes fallowed by a 20 minute dungeon quest. Create Face and name, choose SPECIAL, Combat tutorial with Dad, G.O.A.T, begin dungeon. What we saw at E3 was the entire Character Creation process(minus G.O.A.T) lasting about 5-10 minutes as well. The Vault after will be the remaining tutorials and quest dungeon.  We've seen an edited down 5 minute demo of the character creation process. All the Bethesda games have started with Character Creation, no reason to assume that will change. And all of what was shown occurs in one day as there's no reason to jump around based on what we saw. Which is what the current facts show. Occam's Razor. It's very reasonable to believe it's one day as the content seen supports that theory with the least amount of extra speculation and assumptions. Everything I've said supports it's one day, unless you absolutely believe this entire E3 showcase was a lie or was pulled together incompetently.  Also, October 23rd 2077 was a Saturday, which would be a great coincidence if it wasn't all on one day."
fo4,3dgrkw,-_Nova,2,Thu Jul 16 19:35:37 2015 UTC,"I was wondering about this before. Some people brought up good points that there might be gameplay before the character creation where your face is concealed and you don't speak, like they did in Saints Row 4.  Would seem to make perfect sense if the game started with a dream/flashback to one of the pre-war battles the Veteran was engaged in where (s)he is wearing full power armor so you can't make out any features. All just speculation at this point though, can't wait 'till release! xD"
fo4,3dgrkw,-_Nova,2,Thu Jul 16 06:17:18 2015 UTC,"I have no clue why people would think the game would take place before October 23rd, 2077.    The Great War started and ended on Saturday, October 23, 2077 when nuclear weapons were launched by all the nuclear-capable nations of the Fallout world (mainly from the United States, China and the USSR)   This was taken from the Nukapedia page about The Great War."

The conflicting theme of optimism and fear of atomic annihilation that followed World War II has persisted into the 21st century. It is a fascinating aesthetic, based on visions of the future from the 50s. “In any decade you can ask: what were their designs going to be?” says game director, Todd Howard."
fo4,3dgrkw,-_Nova,2,Thu Jul 16 18:08:05 2015 UTC,"October 23rd 2077 will be a saturday, i think the game actually starts on the day the bombs fell. If so i really hope the intro won't feel too rushed."
fo4,3dgrkw,Morally_Obscene,2,Thu Jul 16 08:59:51 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking more along the lines that Fallout 4 100% does not start in 2075. I think if there is be a portion where you play as a soldier when Canada gets bent annexed, the player will get to experience it after the bomb drops in DC. The PC does get lowered into the vault, per the E3 showcase info, and some how comes out 200 years later. If the player character is in a coma, then it could be possible that he/she remembers the time spent serving in the annexation of Canada. That way, Bethesda would have a clever way of creating a combat tutorial in the game, and the pre-Great War...uhm...war would be showcased. This is all based on if the article from The Telegraph is correct, of course."
fo4,3dgrkw,kwertyuiop,2,Thu Jul 16 11:25:39 2015 UTC,"I agree, especially considering Howard said the game starts with the character creation, which takes place on a Saturday and October 23rd, 2077 is a Saturday. It's possible we'll end up with a combat tutorial taking place while the character is in cryogenic stasis, so it isn't just a fade to black and then suddenly it's 200 years later."
fo4,3dgrkw,Arphee,4,Thu Jul 16 13:56:42 2015 UTC,You're assuming that the moment we enter the bathroom is the first we see of the game. Perhaps we fight in Anchorage in 2075 all covered up so we wouldn't have a sex/face?
fo4,3dgrkw,DrakonLitshed,4,Thu Jul 16 03:42:36 2015 UTC,"Except Todd directly states that the game starts here.

fo4,3dgrkw,DrakonLitshed,0,Thu Jul 16 03:54:08 2015 UTC,"All Todd said is that it takes place in that home, before the war.

fo4,3dgrkw,cactar54,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:05:02 2015 UTC,"This is completely inaccurate.

It all comes from 1 sentence in the telegraph article with no explanation. It's a typo. And everyone jumped on it and invented a bunch stuff that will not happen."
fo4,3dgrkw,DrakonLitshed,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:04:32 2015 UTC,"You've also mentioned that it doesn't make sense for them to spend precious development time (although the game is practically done) preparing a special E3 scenario (which most games already do, with less easy to edit worlds than Fallout). Do you really think they would create this huge pre war area for just 5-10 minutes of picking your name and special stats?  The game will be out relatively soon. More info will be coming very soon. We're all guilty of over-speculating, but it is pointless and wrong to claim that anything is ""100%"" when it hasn't been stated, especially if there is more logic and points why the opposite would be correct."
fo4,3dgrkw,ReasonedTwo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:29:22 2015 UTC,"This close to release, they already have the intro to the game from Character Creation to Vault Emergence complete and locked down. Based on how game development generally works(my source: I work at a game dev), content like this would have probably already been completely locked down at least a few months before E3 if not some time last year. That means no major changes to the game's design, it should be feature and story complete. So if they have all that complete, there's no reason to create a fake scenario to show off the game, especially when the game games out 4 months later. If they have the intro complete, it's a 1000 times easier to just record bits of that intro so that everyone who is going to play it will see exactly what it's like. Inventing a new beginning would be a terrible marketing decision, why show off something that doesn't end up the final game this close to the final release. If this was coming out next November, all this would be temp and special for sure, but at this point in it's development timeline, it's illogical to do any of that. Also, the fact that Todd deliberately skips past the vault stuff and says they don't want to spoil that, lends more credence to this being the final version of these events. Why claim to not want to spoil something if you've already been making up everything so far?  Watch the E3 showcase and just listen to everything Todd is saying. Remove your cynicism and paranoia, and try to pull away from your invented expectations and just listen. Does he sound like he's making all this up and this is just temp or he's hiding a bunch of stuff from us in this section of the game? I really don't think there will suddenly be a big complicated two-year runaround jammed into this anywhere.  The E3 demo takes place in one day. All evidence points to that. A hidden two-year time skipping romp through pre-war life has no evidence to support it other than a typo in a random article and the hopes and dreams of people who don't want to actually think about it and just make excuses and assumptions that have no merit.  Also, it's not really good design to make the pre-war section very long anyway. I get the notion that we, the player, need to feel the loss of the pre-war world, but that's not very likely if you want people to actually enjoy the game. Some people will really like to spend some time in 2077, but a majority will not. They'll want to get to the free-roaming adventure as soon as possible. Skyrim and Fallout 3 didn't start until the world opened up to you, they're not going to force-feed all this pre-war flim-flam into your face for a half an hour. 10-15 minutes of home-living and then however long the vault process is(which I assume will probably be the majority of tutorials(although it may be fairly quick since it doesn't seem like you get the Pip Boy until you are about to emerge, but who knows)."
fo4,3dgrkw,xslater583,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:44:26 2015 UTC,"Nobody is implying a change to the story.  It is actually quite likely they would create a ""fake"" (in actuality, condensed/edited) intro for E3 considering they want to leave some surprise and not spoil anything for the players. And to shorten it. If the pre-war segment is, for example, roughly an hour long (I'm not claiming it will be) they wouldn't have the time to show that, and wouldn't benefit from doing so.  Again, nobody is claiming that the entire intro is fake or from a different period. It would just make sense for them to condense it, rather than showing the entire 2 years or whatever it ends up being. Rather than cutting to different worldspaces with different calendar dates, they would just have it smooth and without sloppy transition in a slightly edited demonstration, for the video. They don't want to show the exact intro; they want us to enjoy it for ourselves.  Trust me I've seen the E3 showcase an embarrassing amount of times. I'm not being cynical or paranoid in any way (you should stick to using word that you understand). I don't have any ""invented expectations"" and I've been listening, which is why I've been responding. Yet again, nobody is claiming that Todd is making shit up, but it is realistic to assume they won't show everything so that you actually have surprises in the game.  I'm not sure which comments you're reading. Nobody is implying a ""Two year time skipping romp"", just that there is a small amount of info pointing towards a 2075 start and you shouldn't claim it's 100% false. Going back to FO3, Bethesda had you live through 19 (I think?) years in a vault, and it was relatively well done. If they gave us two years pre-war it would not be surprising, and definitely not some half-assed romp through america. Starting in 2075 does not mean an insane amount of time will actually be spent in the pre-war era. People don't have ""hopes and dreams"" of a long pre-war gameplay, and if anything it isn't a lack of thought that leads us to assume a decent amount of pre-war; it's overthinking and overanalyzing because of the hype. We aren't making excuses or exemptions, we're just discussing the information released. Just to repeat, as your last paragraph seems to demonstrate that you either didn't play FO3 or don't remember the beginning:   FO3 began with you living through 19 years in a vault. It isn't crazy to guess that you might spend 2 years before the war.  If you respond again, I would sincerely appreciate you thinking about what you say so that there isn't more repetition and bullshit. This is getting silly, and it's hard to take what you're saying seriously.  Edit: Accidentally wrote 2015, rather than 2075"
fo4,3dgrkw,DrakonLitshed,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:42:45 2015 UTC,"Thinking it might have a two year playable pre-war section is the same as thinking the game will start 1901, 3233 or 4,000,000 B.C. There's equal support for those as there is for 2075. The only mention of 2075 comes from 1 article with no other information to support why they wrote 2075. They don't saying anything about the 2075 date in relation to why. They just wrote 2075 instead of 2077. If they accidentally wrote 1977 people would somehow think the game starts with a 100 year time skip. Maybe we play as the protagonist grandparents first. No, it's ridiculous, but it's just as likely as the drivel people have been inventing.  There is no evidence or any kind of actual information of a 2075 start other than this instance of a random UK online article saying ""The game starts in 2075."" Tell me why they know this? Who told them that and to what end?  It's a typo. It's not even a quote from Todd or anybody. It's just an info dump in the article. In fact, you just typed 2075 as 2015. It's so easy to make a typo.  And yes, several people have claimed this isn't final or that it was only made for the E3 show, and I've stated why that's unlikely and illogical. It's obviously an edited for time walk-through of the pre-war home life intro, which is a just a fun way to experience the character creation. That's all the FO3 intro was a 19 year character creation frame, and we've seen the character creation here. I'm sure you can walk around and interact with more things, maybe even go outside and meet a neighbor, but for the most part this is probably just going be what we generally get. there's no reason to cram in some time skips in what we saw and there's no reason to create a new intro for E3 when all of that is complete for the final game and can be easily recorded and edited for efficiency to show off to a big audience.  If you respond again, tell me why the 2075 isn't a typo or where there's any confirmation other that. You claimed to have it, but you've dropped it immediately. I think probably because you were mistaken. But please let me know if there is."
fo4,3dgrkw,DrakonLitshed,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:13:40 2015 UTC,"I honestly cannot tell if you're being serious or not. What you say is completely silly, but you're more persistent than a ""troll"" and I'm not showing anger to fuel it. Idk.  It feels wrong even addressing this, but it is not the same to assume the dates you mentioned. 2075 is still just before the bombs, where tensions are high and fights are taking place. Todd emphasized that pre-war is a very interesting era, during the E3 video; a couple of days in that time would't allow for much exploration etc. if that's what they're going for.  Yet again, I am not claiming that article is a perfect confirmation. I am simply telling you that you can't claim with 100% certainty that it is wrong. That is just as inventive and information lacking as all of these other ""confirmation"" posts going around.  I apologize then for claiming that nobody said the game wasn't done; forgot how silly some can be. However that's not what most of your opposition is claiming; all that most of us are saying is that your claim of 100% certainty is just as bad as the false articles of completely made up information. We don't know how it will start, and an article happened to mention 2075.  The article was not confirmed as either true or false; some people may be siding with it, as Todd seemed to emphasize that we'll be able to somewhat explore the pre-war world (which would take more than a few days, probably). However, if it was a typo, the website (as I did) would have likely corrected it or added a disclaimer that they made a mistake; until such happened, we don't know it as true or false.  Even without the article, it would be realistic to have a longer pre-war period, and it is unproductive to claim 100% certainty in anything until Todd or Bethesda says/shows it.  Also, Todd (as I mentioned) emphasized the importance of pre-war time. If anything would be ""inefficient"" it would be creating an entire pre-war area just for character creation. Similar to FO3 (which was't just a fun intro but actually introduced the entire plot) FO4 will likely include relevant details in the pre-war era to the plot, or the world at least, which they would't give away in the video. I am not claiming that they created an entirely different intro for E3, but likely just selected the home at a specific time (if there are multiple ""time-jumps"", which I'm not saying will happen) and slightly edited the intro quest for the E3 thing so it was smooth rather than video cuts of different playthroughs.  I'm not mistaken, it was just the article that you mentioned. For some reason I had thought it a more credible source, and was wrong in that, but in any case that does not support your claim at all. Currently, there is no information whatsoever to confirm that it doesn't start in 2075; however there is a small, barely significant but still existent piece of info that it does. I am not claiming certainty, you are, and there is nothing certain for either point. Which is all I am suggesting; there is no reason to claim it 100% is not in 2075. Just keep an open mind to the game, and wait until we have more info before claiming anything ""100%"".  Edit: I was wrong when I said the telegraph isn't a credible article; read it again. It's an interview with Todd Howard. While they don't have a quote of Todd saying it's 2075, that's part of what they're claiming Todd had told them. Again, if it were a typo they'd edit it."
fo4,3dgrkw,stonermoment,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:05:27 2015 UTC,"The only claim I made that something is 100% is my own certainty that the game does not start in 2075. And, unfortunately, you and anyone else can't claim that I'm not certain of that. I am. I don't have any doubt on that.  What I'm asking now is think about the 2075 date as a typo and then evaluate the speculation that comes from it. It all falls apart immediately, it's the only leg they've got and it doesn't exist.   If it's not a mistake, it conflicts directly with the game we've seen. And there's no reason to speculate beyond what we've seen, but people like you and others are clinging onto speculation and making excuses as to why it could be different, when I'm actually going off of what we've actually seen in the actual engine of the actual game being presented by the actual developer. I don't think it will have changed based on many things I've already stated and nothing supports that it will. And when I listen to Todd describe the game and the story and how everything is happening on screen, I don't doubt a word he's saying. It makes no sense for him to be pulling the wool over our eyes on this. He even deliberately tells us he's not showing the vault side of the intro, which would be superfluous if this has been altered or has a bunch of hidden stuff in it as well. He walked out on stage and stated, outright stated, that this is where our game starts. He runs us through it and everything on the screen here is direct evidence that this is all occurring on one day. There's no room for it.   Currently, there is no information whatsoever to confirm that it doesn't start in 2075   There's also not evidence of a million others things, but the lack of evidence to negate something is not actual evidence for something. But everything I've stated is evidence. We've seen it on screen and Todd made no indication that this wasn't what we'd be getting. Why can't what you've seen with your own eyes and heard from the mouth of the man who holds this information be evidence over one sentence in a random article that is completely unsubstantiated.  It's a typo, I'm sorry, but it is. The guy who wrote the article wrote the wrong date, he's not a lore master and doesn't know what's significant and what's not. I doubt Todd would have given him the scoop two weeks after he told the entire world at E3 that it starts here.  Everyone here is trying to bend the truth around, making it out that one thing might mean this or that, or that one thing is just hyperbole or that he's hiding something with this bit or whatever, but that's all baseless speculation that everyone has been feeding themselves with. They are just layers of assumptions built on excuses and speculation based solely on one 4-digit year written in a random interview without any further detail.  As for my certainly, who cares? Do you need my doubt? Are you afraid of what I'm saying? Of course you aren't. I am certain of all of this or I wouldn't be arguing it."

These suits are less suits and more human shaped tanks, so you can use things like fluid inserts between head and helmet,  hell even just the right helmet geometry can make a huge difference. If you shunt or distribute an impact correctly it should, theoretically, be no more force on the brain than simple movement."

fo4,3dcs74,shadamedafas,5,Wed Jul 15 13:04:00 2015 UTC,"Well in Fallout 4 at least, the helmet is not a ""helmet."" It's the head covering component of a robot suit. So unlike a normal helmet, it's not something that sits on and covers the head and face, but part of a larger structure. Now I frankly don't know shit about the physics, but I imagine a setup like this would distribute incoming energy somewhere other than the head. Not so much having protection over a head as having a head with a box around it."

Hell, you could drop a 1 ton steel ball from orbit(low earth orbital velocity is ~8000m/s) and even that wouldn't leave a crater: Atmospheric braking will reduce the velocity to ~100m/s easily before it reaches sea level.  A bullet striking the helmet would transfer a portion of it's kinetic energy to the helmet. That kinetic energy can easily be absorbed over a large area without damaging the contents of said helmet."
fo4,3dcs74,supershutze,3,Wed Jul 15 11:58:25 2015 UTC,"Well, the head being a vulnerable spot has always been represented by a higher crit rate by attacks to that location.   It would be interesting if they took things further though, like having the helmet have it's own independent DT that does not stack with body armour. And helmets would provide a lot less DT than the corresponding armour resulting in much more damage.   Characters with crippled heads should just plain die. What the hell's a crippled head?"

In the lore the armor as a whole can shrug off Tank shells so a headshot would be like being flicked with a pebble."

fo4,3dcs74,deftPirate,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:12:30 2015 UTC,"I see. In that case, I'm strongly inclined to think that the weight of the armor mitigates that danger. The bullet actually has to rattle the armor before it can rattle your head, and the armor we've seen doesn't look like it would budge under anything short of a grenade blast or anti tank round. To use another physics analogy, it's like the fly hitting the truck speeding down the highway; maybe they both had a lot of inertia (I'm not a physics guy, so I may start butchering terms here), but one is a whole lot more solid."

It makes sense that the more you do something the better you should get at it which works great with Elder Scrolls but Fallout is a whole different game. Never in Fallout did they require you to use a skill in order to level it up. All different types of skill checks along with killing enemies and discovering locations grants the player experience and from there you allocate the skill points to where you see fit. It might seem strange but it's been like this since the beginning. It just works.

fo4,3df7gf,Kramer88,0,Wed Jul 15 20:26:35 2015 UTC,"That being said, It'd be cool if it did that with weapons, but seems idiotic to split the way skills work into  combat and non-combat."

Which means that you could, from level 1, max your skills because you have a list of locations for free points to turn you from noob to god.  Turning fallout from an RPG to a game meant for meta gaming and wiki checking otherwise you are fucked.  Practically cheating.

fo4,3df7gf,Murder-Mountain,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:00:57 2015 UTC,"Well FO3 did have 20 something books for each skill, usually 25 if I remember, and with the relevant perk you could get almost half of every skill out of the books.   And looking to the wiki for directions is your choice. If you do that you are choosing to ruin the game for yourself. The same thing could be said about published strategy guides and any game ever.   We might as well put a box of skill books outside the vault and do away with skills entirely.   If you look at the wiki then yes, you may as well. If you choose not to cheat the alternative is to comb the entire wasteland looking for knowledge, which I think is fucking awesome and it's one of my favorite parts of the games that already exist.  So tell me, why can't we do it more or less the same way in FO4?"
fo4,3df7gf,vth0mas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:53:38 2015 UTC,"He was talking about having skill books being the stop gap solution to the fact hacking can't be done everywhere. He wanted skill books to be the gate keepers to higher level hacking.  Skyrim's system with skill books littered around to fix the problem of rarely used skills would require them to be not rare since an easter egg hunt gating the end game is insane. You'd have to use a wiki anyway in that case to save you a whole lot of time searching every nook and cranny for a hidden book if they are rare.  At that rate, might as well just do away with level ups providing any points because skill books would be common enough to render any sort of questing irrelevant."
fo4,3df7gf,Murder-Mountain,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:04:08 2015 UTC,"Again I see this shit. ""It would be hard, I'd have to use the wiki"".  You guys don't even sound interested in playing the game. You just want to complete the game. Sorry I couldn't help you find a way to instantly reach the level cap while still preserving some sense of entertainment for everyone else.  Skyrim had both skill books and trainers. You could easily use them to get past the issue of having a low level skill in a high level world, especially if you invested any time at all into a crafting skill. Personally I used a greenhouse to produce a powerful multipurpose potion out of scaly pholiota, creep cluster and mora tapinella. Once distilled and perfected with a high alchemy skill and barely any speech I could sell a 0.25 weight potion for over 1000 septims.  Point is that I'm not a fucking moron, whining about not having everything made easy for me, and I figured out how to afford trainers. I explored the world, found out what I could do, and made choices that ensured my goals. It wasn't difficult, it didn't take forever, and I enjoyed it.  Sorry, not sorry."
fo4,3df7gf,vth0mas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:47:03 2015 UTC,"Would you rather spend hours scouring the wasteland for books to level a skill that isnt even used all that much to begin with? Thats the entire point. Why should skill books be mandatory for a skill that rarely gets used in the base games especially the higher you go?  This isn't whining, this is a game design flaw. Its like having to do 10 hours of playtime to get a gun that is worse than the one you start with.  In the Elder Scrolls, every skill can be grinded. In Fallout, there are very few hackable things to begin with to grind the level up. It also doesn't help that with the multiple paths system Fallout has that makes it easier to just use a key which is often behind a locked desk or just use lockpicks which are WAY more common.  See what I mean? Why would Bethesda nerf a skill that badly?   Unlike Skyrim, Fallout skills are all in competition with one another. Having hacking REQUIRE a skill book or caps puts it at a huge disadvantage to other skills that level up for free and do the same shit.  Why should I do a scavenger hunt to level my hacking when lock picking does that shit already from the get go?"
fo4,3df7gf,Murder-Mountain,0,Fri Jul 17 01:02:11 2015 UTC,"The books and trainers in Skyrim weren't necessary, they helped it along if you wanted to do that.  Why would you scavenge when you have lockpicking which is already a scavenging skill?  Dude, I'm done here haha"

Not skyrim itself. When you interject in a conversation, try to keep up.  Since hacking was a rare separate skill in this scenario, he (the guy I originally responded to) wanted skill books to be the other half of hacking. A mandatory part instead of grinding.  Why would anyone spend any time for an easter egg hunt to level a skill that does the same damn thing as lock picking which levels way faster and easier?  You would need to keep hacking and lockpicking to level. There are not enough computers to hack to grind the skills.  And at that point whats the point of RPGs if you're forced to go one path?"
fo4,3df7gf,Murder-Mountain,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:41:10 2015 UTC,"Dude, you're replying to MY comment thread, and yeah, I'm totally aware of what we're talking about.  And I don't give a shit what the other guy said, I'm saying this: hacking should give you hacking skill, reading skill books and mags should give you hacking skill, trainers should give you hacking skill. Same with lockpicking. With all of these combined you can level hacking in a realistic way.  Your argument is that you don't want to be required to look for things in the game world, or you don't want to talk to people to get training. Well bro, don't know how to respond to that one. The whole fucking game is about talking to people, looking for loot and having adventures."
fo4,3df7gf,vth0mas,5,Fri Jul 17 01:54:49 2015 UTC,"""Don't fix what isn't broken yukyukyukdrrrr""  With the F03 & NV skill system:   You can have an intelligence of 1 and still be a genius hacker, master marksman and shrewd businessman. You can become the best swordsman in the world without ever picking one up. The benefits in the science and lockpick skills were unlocked every 25 skill points but you don't earn that many per level. Your ability to aim and shoot a lever action rifle somehow makes you a crack shot with a pistol, but not with a laser rifle. Your ability to convince someone to settle on a different price is completely separate from your ability to convince someone of literally anything else. If you increase your Survival, eating dog meat can close your bullet wounds... even better than before! So forget the medicine skill if you're playing hardcore mode I guess.   I'm just going to let everyone know what's what here: Those systems were broken piles of shit that somehow managed to not get in the way of an amazing game experience.  Skyrim's leveling system didn't have any real problems that I could see, and I've had this discussion plenty of times. Most of the complaints have to do with exploits (don't use exploits then), having to use the skill to get good at it (sorry that you're a bitch?), not liking ranked perks (as if going from novice to apprentice in destruction or going from rank 1 bow damage to rank 2 bow damage is any different than going from 25 lockpicking/science to 50 lockpicking science).  The only real problem was that the world would level up and leave your untrained skills in the dust. This won't apply to FO4 if 1) there are encounter zones where enemy level is static, which I believe (may be mistaken here) has already been confirmed and 2) if your SPECIAL governs everything then it would make sense why your character with strength 2 isn't the best brawler in the world, and you have to deal with the consequences of your actions because IT... IS... AN... RPG.  Skyrim is a chart topping masterpiece, and most everyone who agrees with me isn't online combating the vocal minority who disagree because they are too busy still playing the game.  So yes, I hope that the skill system is heavily influenced (but of course improved where it could be) by the Skyrim leveling system. I think that most people would agree. Unfortunately, sometimes ""redditors"" isn't an accurate representation of ""people in general""."
fo4,3df7gf,vth0mas,4,Thu Jul 16 02:01:57 2015 UTC,"Counter-argument:  With Skyrim's leveling system, your options became more limited the longer you played; it encouraged you to ""keep doing what you're good at"" and discouraged you from branching out into new trees. This problem became especially apparent at higher difficulties, where switching from melee to ranged (for example) would mean getting yourself killed because you've never leveled Marksmanship.  From a roleplaying/immersion standpoint, this is ""logical"". But from a gameplay standpoint, this makes the game less fun.  Most of your complaints with the old Fo3/nv system focus on how unrealistic it is. At some point, however, you need to make a tradeoff between immersion and fun gameplay.   I absolutely hated how I had to slowly level my magic skills from the ground up just to do the Winterhold College quests. Is it realistic? Certainly. Is it fun? No, I'd rather put some points into magic at level-up and be done with it.   EDIT: Not to mention that this system is, quite literally, how 99% of all RPGs handle level-ups. Mass Effect, Baldur's Gate, Planescape, Witcher, etc. Nobody seems quite so concerned with the lack of immersion in those games."
fo4,3df7gf,meditations-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:24:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I agree that the Skyrim system didn't encourage branching out, simply because the rate at which you leveled up was significantly higher the lower level a skill. It was extremely easy to pick up a new weapon or school of magic and raise it in relatively little time.  The system only really demanded commitment to reach the highest levels, at which skill leveling slowed to a crawl. I would agree that this became a bit of a grind towards the end, but that's not so much a problem with the system itself so much as how progress was scaled. But it makes sense that in order to be good at something, it requires commitment. In Fallout 3 and NV, by contrast, if you wanted to not only become proficient but excel at a skill you merely needed to dump all your points for a few levels at the expense of everything else (that's actually another advantage to the Skyrim system, that several skills could be leveled at once without neglecting any other)."
fo4,3df7gf,Accrudant,3,Thu Jul 16 09:11:09 2015 UTC,"The Skyrim leveling system wasn't bad, but it did come with its own set of problems.  Having to use a skill to get better at it wasn't the problem.  Having to grind the skill repeatedly to get better at it was the problem.  A good game should have you do something harder, break through to a new level, give you a new challenge, repeat.  That's how you do encounter design, scaling from the basic ""kill this bear with your sword"" to ""slay this dragon with any number of abilities you've grown and mastered.""  Skyrim absolutely falls apart when it comes to things like smithing.  Alchemy is close -- you have to explore and experiment to unlock new abilities.  Ok cool.  Each new item is a new ""ha ha"" moment.  Enchantment is also close, each time you find a new magic item you can destroy it to learn how it works.... but then they add in the need to grind those skills to 100 anyway, so I hope you enjoy making enchanted rings you're just going to sell.  And smithing, well, smithing is basically churning out iron daggers over and over and over again.  Slightly fixed in the patch, slightly, but the basic problem is the same.  The game forces you to ""realistically"" craft crappy weapons before you can get to the good stuff, but when ""realism"" causes boredom, you've failed at being a good game.  Now that's not to say I'm not all for a system of leveling through usage.  Lockpicking in Skyrim was fairly decent at this -- you could attempt anything, but the higher your skill, the easier it was made for you, the player.  Stealth felt fairly natural too -- you could sneak around until you were caught, falling back on weapons when you needed to, and the next time, well, you'd sneak a little further.  However, chart topping masterpiece or no, the Skyrim system very often slapped the player in the face with an annoying realization that they would have to repeat a tedious task to ""get to the good stuff.""  Fallout's system, meanwhile, popped up with a ""what do you want to suck less at?"" and then got the hell out of the way.  In some ways immersion breaking that you could suddenly be good at lasers despite having never used one, in others it was significantly less tedious than realizing you -- the player -- would have to spend time doing a fairly boring type of leveling."
fo4,3df7gf,wayoverpaid,2,Thu Jul 16 08:24:50 2015 UTC,I am in total agreement when it comes to the crafting skills. They need to fix that shit.
fo4,3df7gf,vth0mas,0,Thu Jul 16 09:56:58 2015 UTC,"Well said, brother."
fo4,3df7gf,Kramer88,2,Thu Jul 16 02:07:26 2015 UTC,"i wish that bethesda would stop simplyfying the mechanics. Lock picking was made much better in fallout 1 and 2, you had different kind of lockpicks and even electronic lockpics. And you could allways try to pick a lock no matter your skill level, and if the ""dice"" rolled good you had a chance to pick even a hard lock or get it stuck. Also if you didint want to pick a lock you could explode or burn or even kick in some of the doors."
fo4,3df7gf,VNIVIXV,2,Thu Jul 16 00:31:06 2015 UTC,"More complex =/= better. It also doesn't equal worse. It depends what the complexity adds to the game play or overall experience.  Example 1: FO2 Lockpicks. The lockpick's only ability was to add a bonus. The difference between the two levels of lockpick were the size of the bonus. One was clearly better then the other. There was no choice to be made, it was just an expensive resource sync to collect. In fact, the better lockpicks were a late game item whose bonus only mattered in a couple of game locations. Electronic lockpicks were worse. Even the basic set was a late game item and it served as mechanic to limit player access to higher level areas of the game. Electronic lockpicks added complexity, and took away from the game at the same time. Which locks were mechanical and which ones were electronic was also arbitrary. The automated sliding doorways in the Vaults and the Sierra Army Depot were mechanically locked (except for the retinal scanners in the SAD which couldn't be hacked).  Example 2: FO4 weapon mods. The entire FO4 crafting system is more complex then anything we've seen in previous games. It certainly has people excited. If it adds to the overall gaming experience as much as people think it will be a good thing. If the mods are balanced against each other forcing the player to make actual choices about how they kit out their weapons it will be epic. On the other hand, if mods just add stacking bonuses pushing towards maximum OPness it will just be a fiddly bit that doesn't add anything mechanically to the game. It'll still be cool, but it will add only minimally to the game while greatly increasing complexity for complexity's sake."
fo4,3df7gf,R_Bakunin,2,Thu Jul 16 02:56:01 2015 UTC,I will cry an ocean of tears if they use the Skyrim leveling system. I personally don't like RPGs where your character can be good at everything.

Like if you were to put on a bulletproof vest, you wouldn't take off your shirt, you'd just put it on on top of your shirt. That is to say that it looks like there's a clothing slot(s) and armor goes over top of it. That's not to say that there's no DT/DR or functional benefit to things that occupy the clothing slot, but it looks like there's cumulatively a lot more being derived from the over-layer of armor slots than isn't."

fo4,3dcz1s,Kiyoko504,2,Wed Jul 15 13:02:29 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, there are three types of ""armor"" per say in the game. 1. Is clothing, such as the vault suit, the business suit, the dress, and so on. 2. Is the Layered Armor, such as the leather, the raider gear, and so on. 3. Is the Power Armor, which seems to be more of a driveable mech suit of sorts. The way it works is that clothing is the base ""armor"" that you wear, but will most likely not provide you with any DT or Armor points, but might give you stats like charisma and such. With the clothing slot filled, you have layered armor, which are the actual armor pieces that you wear over the clothing you've put on. These pieces of armor unlike clothing will be providing you with your DT or armor points. This works very much like it did in Morrowind and Daggerfall, if you've played those games, where you put on cloths, and then can wear armor on top of your clothes. Power armor seems to go even over that, as it seems more like a vehicle you go into with all of your clothing and layered armor on, effectively being the third stage of ""layered armor"".  Now if there are armor sets in the game that are just one item like in past Fallout games, we don't know. Maybe unique armors will all be one suit and go past this new system. Maybe unique armor will just be certain pieces, or a set that gives you a bonus when you have them all. But to answer you question as to whether or not it's essential or best for your playthrough. Considering that this is the new mechanic for armor in general, I would say yes, as it's just how armor works now. It's not as though you'll find armor sets that are just one item like in the old games, you'll find the pieces, which are the Layered Armor."

I had a second or so of thinking my graphics card was shitting it's self and dying when it started to recede to about a quarter of the sky. Then I figured out what I was seeing. Somehow an Albino Radscoripon was glitch-spazzing its way across the sky(and presumably to freedom). It was such a moment of transcendent beauty for me that, just that once, I genuinely wished my computer had the extra power and drive space to run FRAPS(or something like it) just to record that one, single glitch.

First time I played DLCs (the Pitt and Broken Steel especially) it put me off because it kept getting in my face, sure it's funny the first time, maybe even terrifying, but when it happens several times it does become a problem.

So we did what any sane parents would do, and as we set out for our next objective, we faked injuries. I took a knife to the arm, he took a bullet to the leg. And we were discharged.   I left the war and had the baby with my new husband. Life was good. Though every time I looked down at Shaun, I saw all the things I left behind. Every time I heard war stories on the news, I felt selfish. The day the bombs fell, I lost my home. I lost my husband. I lost the world I lived in.

I must say I'm pretty proud of myself for comming up with all of that on my own, I don't think anybody else will have a similar backstory to mine in Fallout-4.

fo4,3dan79,CheshireHyena,2,Tue Jul 14 21:29:51 2015 UTC,"For my first playthrough, I'm going to put absolutely nothing into intelligence and everything that I can into endurance and strength. A little in agility as well. I realize that this will limit the amount of xp I get and how fast I level, but leveling too quickly isn't fun anyway. I'm going to play a mentally-deficient individual, who solves absolutely every problem imaginable, with a club. I'm probably going to end up with full metal armour (PA is too advanced for him. He wouldn't know how to use it) and a tricked-out baseball bat. Something like Lucille, Negan's bat from The Walking Dead comics. I'm going to name him Shapey and make him look as close to a neanderthal as possible. Gigantic brow, beady little eyes, huge mouth, jacked as fuck. And a terrible haircut. His wife, I'm going to make into the most attractive woman imaginable. She fell for his muscles. Flexes Obviously, he won't have a goddamn clue about what happened or even how long 200 years is, so he's just going to be a bit sad about not being able to find his hot-AF wife or baby. And then he'll find a doggy and forget allll about them.  As for what small amount of personality he has, he'll be completely terrified of technology. He'll kill Codsworth on sight and destroy any other robot he comes across. He won't be inherently evil, but he also doesn't understand the significance of life and will thus have absolutely no regard for it. Someone talks to him in a mean/condescending/anxious tone? Say goodbye to your face. Imagine the kind of damage a baseball bat covered in razor wire could do, to a person's complexion. I don't actually know if I'll even be able to finish the story, with him... It really doesn't seem like it would be in his personality to do anything that isn't based on whim, impulse and instinct. So, I'll probably spend a lot of time doing side missions and killing people who don't deserve to die. Oh and I'll definitely be playing with hardcore mode turned on (if they include it) or a hardcore mode mod. Not sure if I could truly roleplay it, though.   Edit - Thought of a better name."

Smart, perceptive and charismatic, with little focus on combat. His true strength lies in his ability to lie to people; he sees life as a game and the only way to get ahead is by cheating every step of the way. He manipulates entire factions with ease, becoming useful and trustworthy in the eyes of the rich and powerful, only to stab them in the back whenever he sees the opportunity. He creates chaos across the wastes, because chaos is a ladder, and he won't stop til he gets to the top.  I did this in NV and had a fucking blast. Hopefully the faction mechanics and such are deep enough for me to play through as the penny-pinching, politicking pimp that is Littlefinger."

As time progresses the dog will start talking to him and become very judgmental. if it wasn't for the fact the dog that belittles him is the only permanent source of companionship he has he'd likely have ate it a long time ago. eventually madness will take over and all the plot will be ruined as he finally agrees with his dog that the world deserves to burn and goes on a killing spree through the wastelands with only whispered stories of horror passed around campfires as his legacy.

His job was simple enough: Cook up the C4's and other explosive contraptions, and making sure whatever gear the privates managed to destroy got repaired before they were thrown out into the field again. However, when those artillery guns from FO3 DLC (those giant things you had to blow up) were taken by the commies, his position was blown to pieces. He survived however, but only because some idiot managed to destroy his waste disposal system in his T-51b while out on a patrol, and couldn't move.  In need of more soldiers (since one of their positions was blown up by the artillery), he was put out into the field to help with disarming mines, get them past locked doors and terminals (horrible at lockpicking and hacking, but blowing up stuff with C4 works surprisingly well).  When Anchorage finally was liberated, he was hurt from a stray bullet during the fight. In the medical tent, he met Nora (Sole Survivor, female), and, like always in war, they fell in love (because who doesn't love the typical hurt soldier/medic love scenario?).  You know the rest from here. Survive Anchorage, get's married, lives together in Boston, Great War, stuff.  It will be a hard time for him. Not only seeing the land he once served to protect from this very threat reduced to ruins... but also knowing, that maybe just one thing... if one thing back in Anchorage had changed... this might never have happened (bullshit, I know, but bear with me for the sake of RP).  And that will be my character. Overall good times. Super fun stuff. Also, explosions."

You may want to do a little reading on T-Force and No. 30 Commando. Their main goals were capturing Nazi tech/information before it was destroyed in the war. Ian Fleming based a lot of the character James Bond on men from these 2 units.

I have a made-up universe that I've been writing stories in for some time. Because of that, I often throw a character from my universe into games I enjoy. So, my character is an extraterrestrial sent to watch the planet but not interfere too much. She just has to act as if she's from the planet. Her people even built a relationship with a family and convinced them to replace their own daughter with my character, ensuring she could infiltrate the planet without suspicion. She falls in love with and marries a human (or possibly another extraterrestrial agent) and has a child with that person (if they're human, I explain the ability to have a child as them having a similar biology.) She joined the military at some point for her studying of the planet as well. It's a little crazy but I feel it works well."

True, but it's been 200 and it's quite possible the tech to make them is rare/hard to use due to resources.

fo4,3d7agu,Attacker732,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:24:24 2015 UTC,"Stopping and starting nuclear reactions may not be feasible (speculation based on my limited knowledge of real nuclear plants) as the reactions are self perpetuating if done right and significant amounts of energy would have to be expended to restart them if not stop them as well which would negate the advantages of saving fuel in the first place.   Since the power sources are all based on Plutonium or Iradium of specific  radioactive isotopes, they materials would continue to decay regardless of whether power was being drawn.   This is all speculation but based on how powerful Power Armor is from what we've seen I'd be terribly surprised if Bethesda didn't balace it by having a limited power source and having to repair the armor. In some scenes it showed enemy armor (including Brotherhood) being at least partially destroyed and I swore I saw a ""Repair"" option in the garage menu for armor but don't count on that."
fo4,3d7agu,Lizardsoul,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:41:04 2015 UTC,"I thought the power armors, aside from the T-45 models, used cold fusion.  As such, controlling it would be as simple as shutting off the fuel.  The fuel, likely hydrogen/helium isotopes, wouldn't decay notably.  If the Jetpack can only be used with the Power Armor, then yes, it is incredibly powerful by giving both mobility & protection.  If there are other armors, such as LR's Riot Armor, that can use it, it's not much better off than NV's power armor IMO."

fo4,3d8c0d,Halitrad,4,Tue Jul 14 16:14:41 2015 UTC,We have generators. We can make an indoor farm with hydroponics and artificial light sources. Whole building is now a farm.
fo4,3d8c0d,jpfarre,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"Good luck finding all that in the wasteland, man.  Even modern-day, hydroponics and indoor farming are easily messed up.  Also, is your whole building now a farm, or is your building now a defensive barrier against invasion?  You can't have both, otherwise if your defenses fail you lose food, water, valuable farming equipment that will be very difficult to replace.  The idea is the definition of 'Awesome but impractical'.  There's no way to make such a thing practical in a hostile area.  In a town, even a wasteland town like Megaton?  It could work.  But you'd have to have a town built around the base of the skyscraper and rely on that to keep it safe - and if you have a town built around the base of the skyscraper, why do you need the skyscraper to build a town in?"
fo4,3d8c0d,Halitrad,4,Tue Jul 14 19:31:20 2015 UTC,We can build turrets and computers. I don't think a pump will be difficult.
fo4,3d8c0d,jpfarre,0,Tue Jul 14 19:32:51 2015 UTC,"You need a lot more than a pump.  Hydroponics is growing food without any soil; this requires you have ready access to massive amounts of water, the proper nutrients to enrich the water with, the knowledge to add the nutrients properly and keep the plants healthy, the proper lights (You can't use just any old light bulb,) and in a continuous flow system, you also have to account for a wide range of other problems that could appear.  There's a reason hydroponics isn't a common farming method today.  It's great for growing plants in small spaces with limited resources, but it requires a lot of micromanagement, requires specialized equipment with its own upkeep, and in systems that aren't carefully monitored, the whole system quickly dies out as any of a wide range of things goes out of balance and causes a cascade of further imbalances.  Plants evolved to grow in soil.  The more soil you take away, the more complicated the process of growing them becomes.  What you're talking about isn't 'building a computer.'  It's the same technical know-how you would need to mine rock, smelt metal out of it, extract the elements, and create a computer from scratch, starting with nothing but what you find naturally occurring in the ground.  That's how much of an in-depth knowledge you would need to keep an indoor hydroponics field to fill a skyscraper's floors growing healthy and strong and fruitful."

fo4,3d8c0d,Pathox,0,Wed Jul 15 02:07:05 2015 UTC,"Sure.  You'd probably need a couple vaults-worth of them to rig up a skyscraper hydroponics garden on each floor.  Also, considering the potential side effects on humans, there's no telling what they might do to plants.  Remember, NOTHING in the Vaults was actually made to work as advertised."

fo4,3d8c0d,Laxian,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:48:12 2015 UTC,"Actually, if someone can take over the ground floor, they can light a fire, or just drill out support beams until the tower collapses. Not a lot you can do if they get past the lowest defenses."

fo4,3d8c0d,Laxian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:02:39 2015 UTC,"They wouldn't even really have to get inside, if you've got a good supply of explosives there are a lot of things you could do. Mine the sewers perhaps, get into the foundations from below, throw molotovs and bigger fuel bombs through windows, with more fuel bombs surrounding the building so no one gets out. Skyscrapers and even just regular high-rises are also generally very close together, if you can get into the building next door, you can cut through the wall above the ground defenses, then set explosives around the central columns, or light a fire. Or, if you have your heart set on taking the lobby, get a load of rc cars, put C4 and fuel bombs on them, and drive them into the lobby from every direction. If just a few get in, then your forces can take the lobby, and do as they please to the inhabitants higher up."
fo4,3d8c0d,LordKebise,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:10:51 2015 UTC,"Well, the same strategy would work against any kind of ground settlement (except if it's in a vault with a door that withstands standard weapons...but then you can be either starved out - or buried alive if they barricade your ""nice"" sturdy vault door!), too so it's not an advantage to be somewhere else...hell, we have one example of a settlement like that and it seems to work: Tennpenny Tower in FO3 (!)...still, it's just something that strikes my fancy and if someone really wants to attack you and has the men power and weapons to blow you sky high they will, no matter your defenses (that's why the best defense is still a very very good offense - hit them hard before they hit you and stomp on them while they are down...or (frowned upon in polite society): put a bullet in their heads when they are down!)"
fo4,3d8c0d,Laxian,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:07:05 2015 UTC,"Tenpenny Tower doesn't really have any major enemies, the only people attacking it would likely be raiders, who would just try and rush the walls.

fo4,3d8c0d,DrakonLitshed,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:40:30 2015 UTC,I like the idea of having my very own cloud city the only problem I see with it for me from a game standpoint was something I learned in New Vegas. The lucky 38 was a highrise base that could store all your minions but it was a pain in the ass to zone into just to swap minions let alone if you chose to set the place up as your main base of hording. the only way that place will work for me is if I can quick travel to and from it easily otherwise I'm likely to abandon the location until everyone in Boston is dead and I have no where else to go (including my other settlements).
fo4,3d8c0d,kaptiansimian,2,Tue Jul 14 14:01:40 2015 UTC,"It was a pain in the ass because of Fallout New Vegas, though.  It wasn't a pain because it was a tower.  They could've easily given you a fast travel icon for the tower, instead of dropping you off in freeside at the gate and forcing you to go into The Strip, then into the casino, then into the suite.  It was annoying and it's probably why I'm always carrying a few hundred pounds of junk, instead of storing crafting supplies until I can build something."
fo4,3d8c0d,SugarBombs-mininukes,2,Tue Jul 14 14:12:27 2015 UTC,and that's the fear if it's easily fast travel able I'm naming the mayor Lando Calrissian and I'll be there all the time. If by being in a remote location like that where I have to fast travel to the area then muddle through the lower levels to get to the rooftop to work through the maze of defenses without blowing myself up to get into the city and then sprint through the marketplace full of psycho dealers to get to my crafting benches and item caches it becomes the new lucky 38.  Like I said if they didn't learn this lesson from new vegas boo if they did and made it easy access then hells yea I'm all over this.
fo4,3d8c0d,kaptiansimian,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:26:26 2015 UTC,"It would be a bit difficult to set up a custom travel point in something that could dynamically change constantly. I'm willing to bet that in vanilla your fast travel point for the settlement will put u either at the Entrance (more or less where the raiders will assault u) or at the red rocket station that so far all the settlements we saw are based around. Modders could probably add a settlement item that sets a custom waypoint to travel to at the top/core of ur floating city, if we can build that high lol."

Instead, it could be a place that's for tower defense. Like there could be a machine that could produce something valuable; like bottle caps, ammo, or a crafting material. And it could take time for it to produce so that if your not there when its finished, a raider could have stole it. And if you were there you could have fought off raiders that came to steal what you made. And it's a tower, there could be raiders on lower floors that you could fight as a sort of gauntlet challenge just so you can get up and down the tower (this could also mean that their could be shortcuts to unlock to make it easier to traverse the tower)."

After that he decided to just go on a murderous rampage and kill every one of the never-ending stream of guards.  Eventually he had killed so many, that my xbox360 was no longer loading the guard's AI properly; they would just run up to him and then stand there and do nothing.

Nothing was marked as stolen/owned so you could just take whatever you wanted from anyone and it really made the world feel shallow and less immersive. Having item's marked as being owned by someone creates a sense of... connection i wanna say, it very clearly points out that this belongs to someone else, if you take it you have to face consequences, letting players get away without consequence is what GTA does and the game feels really shallow for it. yeah sure cops come after you but once ur arrested or ""killed"" it all goes away and ur just another random joe like nothing happened. It's far from a perfect system (bethesda karma in general) and needs a little work still. RRunner316 has a good idea of just one massive negative karma and then their property becomes yours, especially in an apocalyptic setting where ownership is determine solely by who has the force/might to claim something. And as far as karma goes in general haven't you ever walked up to someone and just got an immediate feeling that there was something shady or trustworthy about them without knowing them, that's what karma represents in game."

Consider this scenario - something I've done a few numerous times in Megaton for shits and giggles: You murder Confessor Cromwell with a sniper rifle. The entire town readies their sidearms and starts taking shots at you from every angle. You run into Lucy West's house. You kill her. Then every Megaton Settler and their cousin starts walking through the door. You kill them. In between breaks you rest a few hours in your newly owned formerly-Lucy-West's bed. Now you're fully healed. You head out of the room and pick off stragglers. Rinse and repeat until everyone is dead. You now own all of Megaton, you can take all their stuff.  Admittedly the murders on their own would net you enough bad karma to make you evil, but being able to claim a bed upon killing the owner would allow for quick heals and additional murders too easily."

If the game was about the struggle to be good despite all the easy and convenient options being evil, tracking if you are good or bad makes sense.     In Fallout it would make more sense to track reputation with factions, and if there are witnesses (surviving) your atrocities then you get a reputation hit and a fat nice bounty on your head.

fo4,3d9ij5,Howard_Alan_Treesong,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:02:42 2015 UTC,"Here is my theory; Some people may know what Gamestop did with their highly acclaimed Wii exclusives Metroid Prime Trilogy and Xenoblade Chronicles. These games were in a limited stock upon release and since they were very good products, supply and demand took place and quickly the games were up to the $100+ range on eBay once Gamestop 'sold out'. Well, about 2 years down the line, Gamestop just so happened to get a huge influx of 'used' copies of both of those games and charged like $80 for them when their original release price was $50. Essentially Gamestop withheld half of their stock on both games because they knew they anticipated this demand and were then able to release new copies as used and jack up the price and bypass the actual new price of the game and make more profit.  Now I feel like this hasn't just been for this Pip Boy edition, but it seems like a lot of retailers have let's just figuratively say have 10,000 stock of this product and are only going to release maybe 8,000 prior to release. Then once Nov. 10th hits you'll slowly start to see this leak into Gamestop, Best Buy, etc. as used, but completely intact and new and selling for $400+.  The errors these orders are making are they are actually selling copies they have, but have to cancel some based on them trying to hold some back until after the actual release and spike the prices up"

Although it isn't much of problem for me, I feel if you're crafting your own stuff you could at least refurbish it. Maybe they do have that in the game, and it just costs extra supplies or a perk or something. That'd be neat. It's not like the apocalypse just started or anything; it never made any sense to me why people wouldn't tidy up or refurbish anything."
fo4,3d8vp0,Nicky_Nuka,7,Tue Jul 14 12:48:38 2015 UTC,"I think it mostly comes down to a lack of knowledge, when society completely collapses you no longer have a basic education system so we go back to the old days of kids being taught solely by their parents so if the parents don't know something it doesn't get passed on and the average intelligence level of an area begins to drop with each generation as things are forgotten in the face of focusing on more immediate survival needs. Who need's to know how to put up drywall or run an indoor piping system when u can barely find food and water to survive. Between the institute and our PC being from the old world so far it looks like there is more of a focus on finally rebuilding the ruined world where previous Fallouts were just all about surviving and power struggles over what was left."
fo4,3d8vp0,DrakonLitshed,3,Tue Jul 14 13:31:24 2015 UTC,"It's a nitpick, but it wouldn't be the intelligence level that would drop. Rather, it would be the knowledge level. ""Intelligence"" implies that brain capacity would decrease, which wouldn't happen, certainly not over 200 years. (Well, other than possible effects from radiation)"
fo4,3d8vp0,Coniuratos,4,Tue Jul 14 16:01:51 2015 UTC,"yes my apologies, I meant average Knowledge level not direct intelligence lost. They wouldn't even be able to make something like megaton happen if they all got physically stupider lol."

A post-apocalyptic wasteland like Fallout generally feels like the scraps of the old world, as you said, but NV gives the impression that things are coming together again."
fo4,3d8vp0,StovardBule,2,Tue Jul 14 20:15:17 2015 UTC,"Definately, that was the catch 22 for me with NV, it did good with that feeling of civilization bouncing back and reforming, but at the same time Fallout 3 felt more apocalyptic and dismal lol."
fo4,3d8vp0,DrakonLitshed,3,Tue Jul 14 20:52:06 2015 UTC,"The big difference is that the Mojave was a wasteland before the bombs fell. There wasn't all that much radiation in NV, and it had a completely different kind of atmosphere.

fo4,3d8vp0,DrakonLitshed,-1,Wed Jul 15 00:42:03 2015 UTC,"Very true, but if you actually follow the lore that they are presenting, your character woke up after a 200 year sleep, so it was like he went to sleep in his normal time, where they may have actually been taught about carpentry and other things by his parents, friends and others, who technically, were possibly alive right before he went to sleep 200 years earlier. So the argument that now 200 years later those values are gone is kind of irrelevant, because the person you are playing as is technically still from 200 years before when the world was normal. It wouldn't be too farfetched that you character still knows ALL of those old world ways."
fo4,3d8vp0,Jude-Baldonado,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:15:00 2015 UTC,"That was my point, now that we have a character from the old world pre-nukes he has the knowledge and skills that have been lost during those 200 years so it makes more sense that he can start building settlements, he's military it's somewhat basic knowledge to be able to build and maintain an outpost/base, he has what the wasteland has lacked someone with the knowledge and will to lead people back into a proper civilization, unlike the NCR and Legion who are trying to rebuild based on fragmented half assed knowledge and failing miserably."

We'll probably get a favourites menu and be able to swap between anything that we've favourited in there, grenades included. Then the grenades might use a hotkey that nothing else touches, much like the shout button in Skyrim. Makes things a lot more open-ended than the ammo swap button in FONV. I remember swapping through the ammo too quickly, while in the middle of firefights and needing to cycle back through it to get what I wanted."

fo4,3dbebp,CheshireHyena,2,Tue Jul 14 23:51:34 2015 UTC,"If they use the favourites system like in Skyrim, they'll probably pause time as well. It would suck if you had to flick through a huge list of items, while getting shot in the face by a super mutant."

fo4,3dbebp,CheshireHyena,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:01:54 2015 UTC,"It was the same for PS3, I had both for both systems, but I do like that it pauses time in skyrim. The thing is, I used a wide variety of spells, shouts and swords/sheilds at a time. So after I got about 20 hours in, I had to scroll through a book to swap to the shout I wanted or to pull out my bow to soul trap insted of using one to kill. It's a great  system that needs to be organized IMO, either by weapon type or properties about the weapon"

When the major version goes from 11 to 12 it won't just be adding new features, but there will (as I understand it) be significant 'under the hood' improvements.  Not least, the ability to communicate from multiple CPU cores to multiple GPU cores at the same time, something that was previously not possible.    I don't think a game would have to be specifically written for DX12 to benefit from some of these optimisations..."

fo4,3daxjb,vraleigh,3,Tue Jul 14 21:26:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely this, however, to build individual houses are there only specific spots or will there be a specified perimeter for the settlement and you can place and move on whatever way you want? I saw in the demo they were very clearly building on a concrete spot already placed there but I wonder if that was just convenient…"
fo4,3daxjb,IoWnUrSol,3,Tue Jul 14 22:10:33 2015 UTC,"Well the concrete slab doesn't contain the whole building by the end of the montage, there was a section that was built out of it that passed outside of this perimeter.

fo4,3daxjb,vraleigh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:30:13 2015 UTC,"The place would need to have scrap around you can break down to actually build. It would sucj if you needed to walk half way to Boston from the far end of the map because your dream house is without breakable scrap. There was a lot of examples in the gameplay, with what looked like an old harbor used for fishing, a tree house (ME WANT), and of course Sanctuary Hills. I believe there will be some specific places, since it probably would need a crafting bench at first to break down the stuff as we saw in the gameplay. Maybe modders can add them in at other places to give us more options later."
fo4,3daxjb,jona690h,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:59:35 2015 UTC,"All we've seen so far is every settlement was built around a red rocket station (except maybe Sanctuary Hills) so that might be the only location u can find the settlement workstation, as for materials they don't seem very different from the materials we use in weapon modding so you can probably ransack a lot of junk then break it down. Can also set up Caravans so down the road you could probably transport a lot of materials you couldn't normally carry that way between settlements."
fo4,3d8r3d,valvoja,13,Tue Jul 14 11:35:50 2015 UTC,"One thing I would live to see in the new settlements is a rich narrative around which raiders are attacking you and what they can do to your stuff in your settlements.   They're raiders, they're raiding you for everything you have, including your virginity.   A few days later you come back home to find all your loot taken and the only clue to the culprits is a spray painted tag on your wall.   They're raiders not naughty teenagers, how many cans of paint are in the wasteland anyways? Unless they smear shit, then... Maybe.   make players fear looters and protective of their stuff by giving raider attacks real consequences   Yeah, like spray painting your settlement and taking your virginity."
fo4,3d8r3d,FlyinBananasCantTalk,4,Tue Jul 14 11:59:05 2015 UTC,fallout raiders aren't much smarter then drunk and high teenagers. look all the Great Khan tags everywhere and all the death to the NCR tags on camp McCarren or the tags in Vault 3 I don't know where they keep finding all the spray paint but there is a very rich history of raider graffiti

fo4,3d8r3d,Laxian,6,Tue Jul 14 11:55:44 2015 UTC,"I think the undefended premise stems more from the idea of early game issues. for example you're lvl 4 you don't have the skill/perk/stats yet to build adequate defenses. you toss your spare gear in a chest in your settlement and set out to complete your next quest. while your away raider band attacks throws Timmy down the well and steals your stolen goods from the cache you left in that settlement. They found it because with timmy down the well there was no one to defend the town so they had time to scavenge through your drawers and abscond with your sexy sleepwear, handcuffs, and teddy bear collection. when you get back to town either the raiders moved in and you need to mow them down to reclaim your town or they ran back to their vault 3 equivalent with your stuff and now you have a reason to go find where that is and get your things back before they do terrible things to them."
fo4,3d8r3d,kaptiansimian,4,Tue Jul 14 14:13:03 2015 UTC,Fucking Timmy. Ruining everything.
fo4,3d8r3d,CheshireHyena,2,Tue Jul 14 19:11:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly this.  It would be neat to know that the raiders don't just spawn out of mid air randomly.  There are all kinds of scavengers out there, so maybe you would sometimes find random people trying their luck looting your stuff and you have to make the moral choice of what to do with them when they get caught.  And then revenge. Let's say someone came over to a badly defended, lower level settlement and killed all your people or even worse, stole a bobblehead. It would be great to know someone did it and then go on a rampage in their base once you are a bit stronger."
fo4,3d8r3d,CheshireHyena,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:37:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but once you found and killed off all of the raider groups within a few miles? I mean, you'd be guaranteed security if there were no random spawns, but it would probably get a bit boring if you didn't have to defend your turf. Even if you had metal walls and a gate that only opened from the inside; if there were random spawns, you could stand on an elevated platform or something and have fun picking them off as they swarm around, trying to find a way in."
fo4,3d8r3d,kaptiansimian,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:15:53 2015 UTC,"theoretically even if you ""cleared"" the area they were using as a base they could just respawn there and patrol outward to provide a constant evolving threat. you would set the spawn point at that camp within pathing range of the settlement plot and as the base gets stronger so do the raiders spawning out of x location. games like Lunar used a reactive creep equalizing system where the enemies got tougher as you leveled. for example fighting x boss at level 7 was tough but doable sitting back and grinding to lvl14 didn't make X boss easier as it's level and ability scaled with you. things like this could give raiders some teeth to provide a constant threat to settlements because if war never changes then the wasteland in and should be never safe."
fo4,3d8r3d,CheshireHyena,2,Wed Jul 15 13:23:17 2015 UTC,"While I agree that this would be a cool way of doing it, I doubt it'll happen. I think that the raider attacks are probably going to be a lot more shallow, with them spawning at a random distance away and then immediately attacking the settlement. But hey, maybe I'm just a pessimist. Either way, it'll be a great game I think."
fo4,3d8r3d,kaptiansimian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:31:30 2015 UTC,You're likely right on that one but I'm ok with shallow raider attacks if it means they put more time into story lines and building mechanics. Its not like the modding community can't improve on short comings like that on their own.
fo4,3d8r3d,CheshireHyena,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:40:15 2015 UTC,"The team/person who made the RTS mod for FO3 and NV will probably make a FO4 version, to improve on certain aspects of the settlement-building."

fo4,3d8r3d,kaptiansimian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:00:55 2015 UTC,"the downside is it will frustrate you at time the plus side is you become more invested in your hatred of raiders. we saw this as a big thing in Games like WoW where people got brutalized by swarms of murlocks early on in thier progression and later those players would routinely go back to the low level murlock spawns for no reason other then merlock genocide. By adding consequences like relocating your stuff without destroying it the game designers can provide minor setbacks to extend game time as well as evoke emotional responses like ""F*****G raiders stole my bike again!"" Hate can be a galvanizing point and aid in game immersion.  As for my choice in items stolen it just sounded more interesting then , scrap metal , 9mm pistol , and sugar bombs. plus is fun to typecast based on possessions like an anthropological study.    Sexy Sleepwear , handcuffs , Teddybears : you think Librarian from Tomcats sugar bombs , toy car , That Gun : sci-fi enthusiast  Baseball bat , grimy prewar business suit , prewar money : mafioso?  give it a shot you might have some fun ;)"

I know - I butchered my share of Murlocs, though mostly I was helping friends out with their (early game) characters ;)  Still, I don't want my gear taken - period!

fo4,3d8r3d,kaptiansimian,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:54:58 2015 UTC,It is an interesting twist I'm sure they won't be raiding npc locations at all and since player settlements are completely optional there is nothing stopping you from sweeping an area to use as a base/supply depot. regardless we're just spitballing ideas here and come November we could and probably will be way off as far as this goes. likely for something like this we will have to fall back on the modding community to create addons for random encounters like this. which would likely work better since it would be optional.

fo4,3d8r3d,DrakonLitshed,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:48:36 2015 UTC,"My assumptions based on what we've seen and what i feel is logical, when you have a single house raiders aren't really going to know your place even exists let alone anything worth stealing. As you grow your settlement attracting people to live and work there, set up supply caravans and such is when your settlement draws the attention of raiders, u have supplies and people they want. At that point failing to have enough defenses to repel the raiders will most likely result in ur settlers being killed/kidnaped, ur buildings damaged and a lot of loot placed in storage should disappear as it was stolen. If this doesn't happen then bethesda fails and deserves a kick in the nutsack for half-assing it!"

Perhaps, if they took my stuff, and there was a defining hint at who took it, and each raider faction had a single safe with only my stuff in it, then it would be ok.   This idea really intrigues me though. I trust they'll implement something suitable."

What is a ""high and tight douchebag""?   I'm not worried at all about whether I look ""smart or cool"" on Reddit, I'm speaking my mind like anybody else is. Whether a dozen dorks downvote me or not is irrelevant, because I'm more interested in the discussion and debates for information.  Moving on - I've been a gamer since I was very young, as my father worked at IBM and HP before he died when I was 12. I've been a die-hard Fallout fan since the first two were released. I'm also completely fine with never seeing another trailer or presentation for it until I get my own hands on it, so personally, I simply don't understand why people come across so assertive and entitled in gaming forums/communities about whether they get another hype-filled trailer or not. Yes, I understand and agree that it's fun to have new material to explore and discuss, and yes I enjoy the hype for my franchise like everybody else does.  ...I just don't get why people choose to express some kind of arrogant entitlement about it, because the bottom line is that if you're a fan, you're going to play it anyway. The company itself doesn't even have to market it hard to build hype. We're not talking about a product that nobody is familiar with, which wpuld make hype and news key marketing in involving the public's attention. We're talking about one of the top 10 biggest and most popular gaming franchises of the last two decades, set in a popular environment. Everybody loves post-apoc, it's the new black. Bethesda's marketing team would barely have to intentionally hype Fallout 4, because the entire gaming world printed or posted will be jizzing all over themselves leading up to and after November anyway.   Especially after Bethesda dropped the mic at E3 this year. Everyone that matters in the community knows about Fallout 4."

I played it, but then I beat the main story and was. ok. I didn't buy any of the DLC. I legendary on PC, but I still haven't bothered replaying it.  I hope fallout4 has stuff to DO, sort of like radiant questing 2.0. I just really feel like the map isn't going to be that big. Bethesda used to have a monopoly on open world adventure games. But open world is now a main stream gimmick. I mean if you noticed, they didn't do the ""see that mountain, you can walk there"" routine.  Which means they know its a dried up line. Just look at their other polished features like voice acting and gun play, that mixed with the minecraft mode, seems like it is trying to say:   ""hey, isn't this awesome, don't be freaked out if the map seems small""  They seem to be going quality of quantity.

We'll play it, like it, not love it, and Bethesda will widen its player base. Those who loved the old games will play them automatically and they will finish wrapping in the new gamers and fans of character rather than world-based RPGs (Bioware). They will never fundamentally change the game and thus will not have to take a step back to the roots (unlike say, 343 who are trying to step back to the arena combat roots of Halo and retreat from the failed experiment of Halo 4 to the small innovations of Reach).

No you don't, because they're not there filling up space to make the map bigger."" They've confirmed since E3 that there's no space-filler mountain areas and there's a lot more in these would-be empty spaces, which makes the map seem a lot bigger this time as a result.  Actually they've told us there's a LOT more to do in the game compared to the others, while keeping a Skyrim-sized map.   In summary, think Skyrim without the mountains and towns etc. in place of them. They have focused on quality AND quantity"
fo4,3d9dng,Kingofderp69,5,Tue Jul 14 15:01:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly I LOOOOOOVED the karma system in New Vegas, I understand why FO3 would have it black and white because you're supposed to be the ""legend"" trecking across the wasteland and everybody hears about you. but having certain groups of people hate you white certain cities love you made SO much more sense to me."
fo4,3d9dng,OpticRocky,14,Tue Jul 14 17:58:42 2015 UTC,I really hope they don't ditch it. It's one of the best parts of fallout and how you interact with characters.
fo4,3d9dng,x5060,7,Tue Jul 14 15:22:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but there's a difference between committing a crime against an individual and having them react, and committing a crime against an individual and suddenly, an unrelated character treats you differently. It's a primitive karma system that was necessary in older games due to hardware limitations, but I think Bethesda should make it a bit more specific this time around."
fo4,3d9dng,DrakonLitshed,4,Tue Jul 14 15:33:12 2015 UTC,"So u've never met someone and had an instant feeling weather there was something shady about them u want to avoid or felt u could trust that person? Also keep in mind the psychology of someone who commits primarily charitable acts and someone who constantly lies, steals and kills are going to have very different mindsets that will reflect in their body language, how they walk, their stance, how they talk, the tones they use. Since our characters have been silent protagonist it's easy to assume NPC's are gleaming these clues to react to us.  On that note the faction system in NV was executed much better than the karma system, since Todd said their focus has been making the game account for every possible fail state it makes me think it's possible to ally/hate any faction and choose who you side with and who survives. So i hope both are still in but touched up and improved."
fo4,3d9dng,DrakonLitshed,6,Tue Jul 14 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"People can be creepy without being serial killers. Similarly, people can be serial killers without being creepy. But wouldn't it be cool to play through a series of missions, making one faction think you're helping them, when you're actually destroying them? I would like the option of tricking the NPCs, rather than all of them instantly knowing when I've committed a good or bad deed."
fo4,3d9dng,DrakonLitshed,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:00:46 2015 UTC,"You can do that sometimes, help someone along the way of a quest then at the end turn on them and kill them. Just because u hid your intent doesn't make the deed any less evil. And that's all karma is, spiritual ideals aside, its just a measure of the good and bad (decided by the basic measuring stick of unprovoked violence and taking items belonging to another versus giving them something without reward) deeds to align u with various factions. Are the talon Company going to want someone who constantly helps people for free on their payroll? Are the Regulators going to hire a psychopath that kills anyone he meets? its a way of keeping the players actions in sync with how the world should react to them. Look at Skyrim, it didn't have a karma system so you could be a paragon of justice, a Thane of every city which means helping people, top commander of the empire troops but still join the Dark brotherhood, murder people just because u get payed to do so and even assassinate the emperor of the empire you are a heroic champion of. It creates a very confused and in-concise character/game."
fo4,3d9dng,DrakonLitshed,3,Tue Jul 14 16:15:00 2015 UTC,So you're arguing that it would be too much for current gen hardware to program different groups of NPCs to perform different functions based on the players decision? I truly do not see how it would be too much.
fo4,3d9dng,tajjet,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:17:03 2015 UTC,"Not at all i said in my original post NV faction system (which does that same thing) was better than bethesda's Karma. The karma system was even still in NV but was over shadowed. What im saying is instead of completely removing them which would make things similar to the Skyrim example they need to merge and improve the two systems. it's not unfeasable for a faction to have standards as far as how they expect their members/allies to behave and would distance themselves from anyone who doesn't meet those. A prime example is the Lyon's Brotherhood in FO3, now in that game we worked with Lyon's no matter what because that's how bethesda wanted it, if they had giving more player freedom and story flexibility do you think a guy like Lyon's would have worked with a PC who was a psychotic murderer no different from any raider? This is an example of how to better balance the system, mostly use the karma system so each faction first considers how you've interacted with them, but once u get pass a certain level of reputation they also look at your karma to decide if your the kind of person they want to be associated with."
fo4,3d9dng,KroegKind,3,Tue Jul 14 16:33:04 2015 UTC,"But your examples could seriously all be fixed with a refined faction system. It doesn't matter how evil or good your action is, not everybody in a 50 mile radius will know about it, especially if it's something as worthless as stealing a fork from a legionary hut.  And they should be observing the perspectives of other factions and settlements. They shouldn't just look at an arbitrary checklist of ""is he good or evil,"" because that is, as I've said, subjective."
fo4,3d9dng,Eissa_Cozorav,0,Tue Jul 14 16:36:25 2015 UTC,"There still should be a way for the game and people to long term track your overall deeds so people who aren't affiliated with a faction. Steal an item in a shack with no one around to witness it, absolutely doesn't count, Kill some hermit that doesn't know anyone outside his hut in the middle of know where that affects no one else doesn't matter. The game should still track observed actions since no matter what our character is someone who becomes very notable in the world and people should treat you based on how you've acted in that world. Factions treat you based on ur rep with them which is based on weather you help them or attack and steal from them, the people of Novac don't form a faction so each member reacts to you based on karma determined by observed actions that could get spread around by word of mouth. This is the kind of improvements i'm suggesting. It would be far better than just completely removing it and leaving a void in how the world reacts to the player."
fo4,3d9dng,Eissa_Cozorav,3,Tue Jul 14 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with a karma system working in the background as a random stat tracker, but it shouldn't affect how the world as a whole treats me."
fo4,3d9dng,Zeful,3,Tue Jul 14 16:56:53 2015 UTC,"I like both. Karma systems in games like inFAMOUS and Fable are fun, but the faction system in New Vegas fit the game's theme better. I'd like a hybrid like New Vegas' system but with maybe a bit more importance to karma."
fo4,3d9dng,NeuroticNyx,3,Tue Jul 14 16:00:21 2015 UTC,Skyrim fixed this by adding relationships.People have their own personal opinions of you and wil interact accordingly.

fo4,3d9dng,Evil_phd,8,Tue Jul 14 15:29:44 2015 UTC,"yes, it doesn't effect much beside some ending epilogue and your relation with Cass"
fo4,3d9dng,Evil_phd,2,Tue Jul 14 15:32:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly there's a lot of baggage with the term Karma, as it implies the idea of an objective morality everyone is tuned into. And a way of clearing up the baggage of the term would be to replace it with ""attitude"" and have it adjust or expand your dialog options.  The problem with ""attitude"" is that it needs to be a lot more three-dimensional and contextual, as someone insulting authority figures in public doesn't automatically mean that you shit-talk a lover in private.  All in all a reputation is a lot better in terms of providing punishments and rewards for a player's actions, but it needs a lot more steps than the 4 by 4 of New Vegas reputation."
fo4,3d9dng,SugarBombs-mininukes,2,Tue Jul 14 20:36:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd rather have just a faction reputation system like New Vegas had.
fo4,3d9dng,Evil_phd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"Personally, I really liked having a good/evil system.  Little acts of good and evil didn't really affect it. Imagine you steal a bunch of stuff, but don't get caught, it makes sense for your reputation to stay as it was. Blow up a city?  Evil reputation.  Everyone knows you're evil."

Hell if you watched the damn reveal trailer you would know that the graphics have been heavily improved (compared to FO3 and FO:NV), and you can see that physics has also been improved from the ghoul scene.

I'm not sure you made that clear when you responded to virtually every comment in this thread with that, verbatim.  I watched every second of the E3 video, and they did not address half of what I talked about.  I also stated several times throughout the video that I was confident they were going to resolve several of these issues based on what they had shown at E3.  So you clearly didn't watch any of it, and are just trolling cuz you're a troll.  /golfclap  However, by this point even a fool or a troll should realize that E3 showcases don't always tell the full story (Watchdogs), so I'm entitled to say ""yeah, I like where you're headed with that, but I'm gonna keep an eye on X and Y mechanics to see if you're following through"".  I'd like to take the time to thank you for being an ethug troll and instead contributing literally 0 to this discussion.  U da real mvp."
fo4,3d9cg1,killjucker5000,2,Wed Jul 15 13:53:08 2015 UTC,"You know when you say things like, ""I really liked this and that from FO3, and FO:NV, but it should really be improved in the next installment."" That sounds a lot like criticism. Also in response to your response of me, I did sit through the video, granted I did not give it my full attention so I might have missed the small amount of original substance that your video provides; but how can you blame me? You have 14 things on your list that you spend around 5 mins each talking about the same thing because you are  stuttering over your own words. Maybe you should have tried to pit your words down on paper or just in notepad you could clearly voice your opinion on something without saying ""um"" half of the time. Also it would be nice if you actually listed some of the things that wasn't just pure criticisms of the previous games, instead of ""you clearly didn't watch the video"", cause you know what? I'm probably one of the only people in this thread that actually at least sat through listening to your video."

How could anyone possibly critique a game that isn't out yet?  You don't even know, because you're too busy trying your troll straw man argument about some tangential point that no one was trying to make.  And you're failing miserably at even that.    Yes I've watched the E3 video.  All of it.  Several times.  A great deal of what I covered in my video (sorry it was too long for you.  Thanks for the remedial public speaking tips, I hope 8th grade is going well for you.  Third times a charm little buddy) wasn't touched on in the E3 video.  Particularly the top few points, in which I also relate them to what's already been covered.  But you didn't hear any of that because you were too busy making failtroll snap judgments on shit you can't even comprehend.  I can't possibly critique Fo4.  It isn't out yet.  We have a couple footage videos, and Fo3/Fonv to go on.  If you think a marketing pitch like an E3 showcase video is all you need to know about a game, then you're as deluded as you are ignorant.  What would you like me to list other than criticisms of the previous games?  There's nothing else to go on.  Whatever omnipotent speculation you think you're capable of regarding a game that hasn't been released yet is moot.  Worthless. Valueless. Meaningless.  Do you get it yet?  I have to keep repeating myself because you seem to have trouble with words.  Maybe that's why you keep insisting on saying the same words over and over again even after they've been pointed out to have no meaning.  14 things times 5 minutes?  Are you honestly insisting, even with your boundless depth of ignorance, that there couldn't possibly be an hour's worth of discussion about a 20+ year old franchise, the last installment of which I have spent over 500 hours?  Either that or you're just supplementing your full trolltard with ad hominem because you've literally run out of things to say.  Either way, you still have nothing."

fo4,3d5xil,Ranma_chan,3,Mon Jul 13 23:14:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Maybe they could sort of base the map off FO:NV's map, where you have one big, giant map with a city part in the middle where the player is trying to get to the city.

Europe just wouldn't work in my opinion, the whole magic of fallout is in it's environment, the retro-futuristic nuclear powered xenophobic ultra patriotic america really sets the tone, and without that it wouldn't fit. As far as a mad max scenario, well, why would they be in canada in the first place? also there are zero fossil fuels left on the planet thanks to the player character in the first fallout who destroyed the last oil rig on earth that was owned by the enclave, so the cars would be a no go. ""what-if"" scenarios are just lame fan service that's not even canon, and as far as new york city though, even as a person who doesn't like NYC personally, I think the idea is completely fantastic, I'd like to see the destroyed city and the works. also codsworth armor>horse armor>dogmeat armor"

A moon base sounds about right, given the independence and complete control the heads of such a place would have. There's building a research complex under a mountain, and then there's building one on a separate celestial body."

Just as a side note if i would call this DLC Fallen Angels."

It might mess with Bethesda's lore a bit, but would be an insanely compelling DLC."

And since it has the most billionaires in the world there, super high tech weapons and armor. Also it's pretty off the grid for war so not much would be destroyed."
fo4,3d5xil,DarkKitarist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:05:53 2015 UTC,"Not sure if an area like that would exist without the computer boom.  The computer boom never happened in Fallout's timeline.  In that timeline, the transistor was never invented.  (Or if it was, it never really went public.)  That means the PCB as we know it never existed.  The game's timeline focuses on making everything nuclear-powered, rather than making everything smaller, faster, & more efficient.  Really a weird timeline when you think about it, considering that energy weapons have DISPOSABLE nuclear energy cells.  Besides, an area with that much wealth concentrated there would certainly be a target to one side or another.  Wealth relies on commerce, and that much wealth relies on commerce with almost everyone.  Say they had been buying oil from the US, that makes them a target to the Chinese.  Or they were selling manpower to China, that makes them a target to the US.  Or say they were selling to both sides, that makes them a target to both, in an effort to cut logistics to the other."

The DLCs that Bethesda makes for FO4 need to be original, yet also tied in with the lore; anything that makes the game more interesting and also plays to the theme of the series."

fo4,3d5xil,rom211,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:25:31 2015 UTC,The problem with doing New York is that the developers can tell the difference between current day New York and post-apocalyptic New York so they decided to ignore the city.

fo4,3d5xil,Caradogpup,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:25:25 2015 UTC,"Canada Abandoned ski resort in New Hampshire or Maine, maybe some legend about ""abominable snowmen"" or something like that Continuation of the game like a Broken Steel kinda thing Atlantic City, sorta like a ""Little New Vegas"" New York, basically where it's a small section of the city and some surrounding area. The city has been completely reduced to rubble according to the lore, and the mission would involve having to go into there (which is pretty much a warzone) to retrieve something extremely valuable that nobody has been brave enough to go after."
fo4,3d5xil,aisforargon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:13:07 2015 UTC,NY is much more than a footnote.  I don't think NY would be a DLC subject since it would be smaller than the rest of the game.  NYC would be a good concept for FO 5 if they want to do a totally urban wasteland.

I think the suggestion for an entire Fallout game to be somewhere other than America is a little silly. We don't know about most of the other world besides 'pretty fucked up', but surely there's people outside of America. Even going to Canada and maybe seeing some Canadian-American rivalries about being annexed would be cool."

How awesome would it be to land a slow motion head shot from a vehicle going at full speed.  Grant it there will be a tremendous amount of work needed to model the vehicles and make driving AI. But we can dream can't we?
fo4,3d5xil,LordKebise,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:53:32 2015 UTC,"A DLC about an Invasion from Ronto (Canadians striking back after being annexed). You have to go there to either defeat or diffuse the situation.   Being sent as an envoy to the mid-western chapter of the brotherhood for diplomatic reasons. I also really love the lovecraftian horror mod mister-sinister thought of.  In all honesty meeting characters from other games is basically impossible as they have neither a designated appearance nor personality so they couldn't really be NPCs, as well as non american locations, due to fallout being based on AMERICA, LAND OF THE FREE™. Canada and Mexico being the exceptions, due to existing factions expanding into them, their close relation IRL and the fact that america invaded them pre-war so they are technically America now too."

Possibly some expanding here? I wouldn't think it too far fetched to have Pine Gap be another Enclave base, there are a lot of conspiracy theories that it's already the US's superbunker in the area. Maybe the US annexed Straya too? Maybe a bit of bias, seeing as how great Straya is, but I'd like to see it in Fallout."

fo4,3d5y76,The_Profit_,8,Mon Jul 13 22:51:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reasoned explaination.  Personally, I find it very frustrating when I go looking for accurate information on something and get suckered into clicking on a link that offers nothing but speculation, or is simply a repackage of information that someone else put together.  I don't like being mislead by people that are generating advertising revenue from my curiosity.  It also makes it difficult to sort out the 'wheat from the chaff' when I go looking for news.  I don't have a problem with speculation.  I have actually listened to a couple of speculation webcasts on a couple of occasions.  However, I actually went into those webcasts knowing that speculation was being offered, so I did not feel mislead or exploited by the people that put up the webcast."
fo4,3d5y76,lutes23,5,Mon Jul 13 21:00:01 2015 UTC,"Well said, and that's how I feel. I love speculation, just let it be known up front that it's speculation. Don't try to make everything leading up to it be 'confirmed facts' then try to defend yourself later by saying 'guys I said speculation 3 minutes into the video after you already wasted your time'."

fo4,3d5y76,BudongHerder,4,Tue Jul 14 17:34:51 2015 UTC,"What is so incredibly frustrating is how people like the one that had to come back later and ""apologize"" for his information (and then hid behind the fact he used the word ""speculation"" at some point, then tried to pawn it off on his outside lore sources, etc) perpetuate the cycle of speculation being taken as fact.   Youtubers such as that one get some online news site focus because those sites are nuts about finding even vague information they can use for their own clickbait bull. But they ignore the fact that mrmatt... I mean, the anonymous youtuber claimed it was all ""just speculation"" and mark it down as fact.   And after some stages of telephone where this site cites this site, who stole the info from this youtuber, who took it from a random speculation on reddit... it then makes it back to the actual community with a new coat of paint and a label of fact.   I sincerely hope Bethesda decides to release the information from Quakecon, because it will be easy as hell for youtubers, and random clickbait sites to claim they were there, and make up their random speculation as fact."
