All the republican just sat on their hands, thinking fuck the middle class we are about making the wealthiest Americans wealthier. Then Obama was like the rich need to pay an equal amount of taxes as the poor, the income divide is to great, and the republicans sat on their hands. Then I go to work thinking man all the middles class people I work with that I hear complain about Obama have to have had a change of heart.... NOPE all these poor motherfucking republicans I work with start with the.... He ain't from America bullshit and calling him a socialist and a Muslim. At that point I was sad for Obama because I knew he wanted to do some good, but how the fuck could you spend your day trying to save ignorant fucking people like this."
ThanksObama,2vo4ou,conspiracy_thug,81,Sun Feb 15 23:59:47 2015 UTC,If you really think about it -just for a second - you're posting a political rant on a thread dedicated to a video where the president can't fit his cookie into his milk cup.
ThanksObama,2vo4ou,umopapsidn,16,Wed Feb 25 21:49:34 2015 UTC,You are right. This is not really the right place for this. Maybe in the loose sense that this video was made to attract millennials to politics and within that I found an avenue to vent and rant my feelings at the moment. I feel sometimes that is the only reason I post is just to get stuff off my chest. I will be more careful next time.  Thank you
ThanksObama,2vo4ou,Crazyhyperway,3,Fri Feb 13 02:23:48 2015 UTC,"But isn't that the point? That Obama failing to fit a cookie into his milk cup is light humor to us, but somehow a rabid republican watching this is going to see just more definitive truth of how evil and horrible Obama is. Thanks Obama by people like that is a sarcastic put-down, to us it's double sarcasm for how ridiculous this blame Obama first crap is."

There is literally an entire book that doesn't feature Sansa, Arya, or Bran for the entire thing except for like, one chapter of Arya.

On the serious note: In case you're stuck in a boot loop — so if your laptop, after ""reverting changes"", reboots and starts reverting changes again (in an infinite loop, like me): I hope you have a) a Windows install DVD/USB (probably optional) and b) some restore points (hopefully Windows does them automatically every time an update comes along).

They need Tim Horton's to make a larger footprint in the breakfast market, and it's possible that the Canadian government wouldn't approve the sale if BK wasn't headquartered in Canada. If this was just about tax inversion, why bother with buying Tim Horton's first?  2) Tax inversion is in fact a political issue."

ThanksObama,2ayzk8,lolplatypus,4,Fri Jul 18 17:48:50 2014 UTC,"As a fan boy, I'm fine with this. Captain America is a great character, and having different people fill the suit over the years has produced some amazing stories. I also think it's a great way to address continuity, thinking that these hero's will be around for ever, but maybe different people will be wearing the suit in the years to come is very cool imo.    The only thing I can think of that really rustled my jimmies, was having Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury. For those who don't know where this came from, Marvel made a second entirely separate universe called the Ultimate universe. Which contained the ultimate avengers, ultimate spiderman, ultimate... living different stories in a different continuity. The Nick Fury in this universe was based directly on Samuel L Jackson. The Nick Fury in the original universe was different and entirely more badass. SLJ version rests entirely on being cool and badass by virtue of being SLJ, where as the Nick Fury in the original book was easily the most kick ass character in the entire universe. He is the greatest secret agent character ever written imo. He always knew what was around the corner, knew when to go on the run, knew when to not trust people, and could work for years, completely clandestine, to get the job done that he knew had to be done.  If you want to get to know this character, I'd suggest you start at Secret War and read the main tie in stories of Avengers Disassembled through to the culmination of Secret Invasion."

ThanksObama,2ayzk8,TinySamurai,3,Fri Jul 18 03:40:10 2014 UTC,"Captain America is the best example. He hasn't consistently been played by Steve Rogers since Issue 25, and I don't expect he will do so very much in the future. Another temporary example I can think of is when War Machine became Iron Man, and the fact that there has been multiple Sorcerer Supremes. It's not something that is really done much, but I think it should be done a lot more.  Edit: Also there have theoretically been lots of different people as Iron Fist, however Daniel Rand is the only one that has ever featured in the comics."

The relevant bit is this:  (b) His biological mother or biological father was born on the   territory of the relevant Association; (c) His grandmother or grandfather was born on the territory   of the relevant Association;   So, you could be French, hold French nationality, but if your grandmother was born in England then you can play for the English national football team.  So, in this instance it would be correct to describe you as an ""English Football Player"", because you play for the English team, but you would not be British, you would be French (in the same way you could describe Barack Obama as an ""English Writer"" - he has written books in English, they could be discussed in an Eng.

ThanksObama,27qjg4,SalParadise,10,Mon Jun 9 23:07:36 2014 UTC,The sign was probably being worked on/installed. New gas station was being built in my town and when they had the sign installed it read 1.23 on the sign for a day. The amount of cars going into the gas station only to leave infuriated/disappointed was fucking hilarious.
ThanksObama,27qjg4,riggsinator,22,Tue Jun 10 15:48:53 2014 UTC,In Chicago. It's not real gas prices though. The pic seems to have been taking while the sign was being calibrated.  Here's the original thread.

ThanksObama,27qjg4,besaolli,20,Thu Jun 19 22:58:33 2014 UTC,"I know the sign is broken, but you have different gas prices for cash and credit in the states?"
ThanksObama,27qjg4,eSALTS,10,Tue Jun 10 02:20:44 2014 UTC,A lot of gas stations do this. It'll be anywhere from a ten cent difference to a dollar difference (from what I've seen) mostly because credit card companies started charging for the swipe through the machine so the gas stations passed on the charge to customers. Quite a few businesses charge an 'atm or credit' fee. Edit: I live in California
ThanksObama,27qjg4,InkStainLV,11,Tue Jun 10 02:33:13 2014 UTC,"The credit card companies always have taken a small percentage of the sale as a processing fee, that is nothing new. What happened was that these days, gasoline is sold at a loss (all profits are made in the shop), so some gas stations charge more for credit cards to offset the additional losses from the processing fee.  Personally I don't buy gas from a station that charges more for credit, regardless if I am paying cash or not. What is even scummier is that using that gas stations rewards card usually counts as a credit card so you pay the higher price."
ThanksObama,27qjg4,Froggypwns,2,Tue Jun 10 04:40:28 2014 UTC,"Well, there ya go. That's a better answer. Personally I have a costco membership so I don't have to deal with the issue. I just always thought it was pretty scummy."
ThanksObama,27qjg4,InkStainLV,2,Tue Jun 10 04:47:10 2014 UTC,"I don't buy gas from a station that charges more for credit, regardless if I am paying cash or not   You've just said they sold gad at a loss. If you want to punish(?) them, shouldn't you buy more gas at the stations you deem ""scummy""?"
ThanksObama,27qjg4,Gracksploitation,1 point,Wed Jun 11 07:26:06 2014 UTC,"I understand what you are getting at, but I rather support the no extra charge guys by buying gas from them and then buying stuff in their shops. That way they still make money off me and I'm not doing business with the scum.    Also the price increase on credit is often greater than the processing charge, so the gas station can possibly make a profit on credit while luring people in with a low and unprofitable cash price."
ThanksObama,27qjg4,Froggypwns,3,Wed Jun 11 13:04:29 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I get that... but a $3/gal price difference in favor of credit?"
ThanksObama,27qjg4,kinyutaka,3,Tue Jun 10 05:31:12 2014 UTC,The machine is broken or this is fake. Why would mid be cheaper than regular?
ThanksObama,27qjg4,BeffyLove,1 point,Tue Jun 10 14:38:52 2014 UTC,Others are speculating that the board was being reset.
ThanksObama,27qjg4,kinyutaka,2,Tue Jun 10 16:23:50 2014 UTC,"Regardless, your comment made no sense because there is no three dollar difference."
ThanksObama,27qjg4,BeffyLove,1 point,Tue Jun 10 16:42:53 2014 UTC,"Actually, no. The previous comment was talking about the price difference between cash and credit in a normal sense, and I was commenting that even that wouldn't lead to this level of a price difference.  My whole point was that this seeming $3 price difference makes no sense"
ThanksObama,27qjg4,kinyutaka,1 point,Tue Jun 10 17:06:19 2014 UTC,"Okay, but are you referring to the $3 on the image that was posted? Like the image that started this thread? That is what people are confused about, because if it was being calibrated or reset then the numbers are completely arbitrary and meaningless so pointing out a $3 difference just doesn't make sense, because they are random numbers."
ThanksObama,27qjg4,phoenixink,0,Tue Jun 10 20:41:12 2014 UTC,"Of course, I'm referring to the image posted.   Do I have to spell everything out?   We all agree that this doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Someone questioned why any gas station would have different prices for cash and credit, which was answered, correctly, that some stations do charge less for cash because of credit card fees.  I then brought the image back into the conversation, reminding that such practice does not explain what is going on here. A $3 difference is extreme, and the cash price would never be higher than the credit.  But i will point out that the numbers are not random, though they are meaningless."
ThanksObama,27qjg4,kinyutaka,1 point,Tue Jun 10 20:52:23 2014 UTC,"Sorry, I just still have no idea what you're talking about. If the numbers are false and meaningless, and not representative whatsoever of actual gas prices, on their own or related to other prices, then why are you pointing out the $3 difference between the glitched prices? There wasn't a $3 difference before, in the original prices which were correct.  I agree that the pratice doesn;t explain what's going on here, because it's a glitch, an error, the prices don't mean anything. There is no $3 difference, just random (or at least meaningless) numbers that don't correlate to anything. It could have just as easily been a $.50 difference or a $9 difference."
ThanksObama,27qjg4,phoenixink,2,Tue Jun 10 21:27:57 2014 UTC,The 3$ diff was a glitch in the display(hence the joke)but usually they lower gas prices with credit because you pay the fee added to it.
ThanksObama,27qjg4,InkStainLV,1 point,Tue Jun 10 16:54:41 2014 UTC,"No.  They normally lower the Cash price, because they have to pay a credit card fee. Normally that difference is about 10 cents per gallon."
ThanksObama,27qjg4,kinyutaka,1 point,Tue Jun 10 17:20:16 2014 UTC,It's like 5-10 cents cheaper per gallon when I see it.  The primary people who this targets is truckers who buy a LOT of gas which isn't on their dime.  For a normal person it's not worth going to the ATM for the extra 80 cents.

They usually say, ""We need to do more to _____ this issue with _____. (Ramble about how this positively/negatively affects people)"". Once that speech is done to see what our president's opinion is on the subject, they then go back to the office and completely ignore the problem.   Now, if enough people decide to mention that they have done nothing about the problem, they make a bill and then take it to congress. At congress, the different sides make sure to disagree with the opposing force to ensure that the bill gets twiddled down to something that is absolutely useless and then pass it. Then both sides get to still argue about how the bill isn't exactly how they wanted it, which the people agree with them that it is still bad, and then they get re-elected.   I completely agree with everyone getting angry that he interrupted a show that, to us, is more important then our useless government.

Presidential = National disaster, terrorist threat, communist invasion, Bad Things With Capital Letters. In short, not the kinda thing you'd wanna turn off.

ThanksObama,24p66w,imsomlgprolike4reel,3,Mon May 5 03:23:28 2014 UTC,"Ok, but this is a means to send messages OUT, it has nothing to do with tracking communications between people."
ThanksObama,24p66w,Aperture_Scientist4,0,Mon May 5 11:30:04 2014 UTC,"How would you know? You really think that the NSA would make it known to general public on how they retrieve, and monitor the communications of the general public? Have you viewed the source code and examined what exactly said feature does entirely?  Fact: NSA monitors practically every communication medium when they should only being targeting mediums or sources where data would assist in the protection against terrorism, and other national threats. Tracking the data of every single American is illegal, and fundamentally against the constitutional rights of Americans.  I have to repeat that because it seems like you're ignoring the underlying fact that the NSA is using massive, broad surveillance. Who's to say that the NSA isn't utilizing one of the best selling Android smartphones on the market?  So if you add two plus two, you will realize why there is a concern over such a feature. It's not about politics of right or left.  Being concerned about the privacy of one's data or own personal lives, and information relating to them is a basic right."
ThanksObama,24p66w,imsomlgprolike4reel,2,Tue May 6 01:39:02 2014 UTC,"I understand that. Really, I do. But all this is is a means of sending a mass text message.   It is IMPOSSIBLE to attach code or other secret programs to a text message service--the text message encoding mechanism can only encode very small data packets, hence the character limit on texts. If a program tried to be sent over the text service the cell tower would reject it and force you to download it via internet or something. As you cannot write a wire tapping program in 160 characters, the government is not spying on you by SENDING you texts.   More importantly, the government has no reason to wiretap this service as they SENT the message--they already know what it says.   Yes the NSA is in your computer, stealin' your internets, but they are not doing through this service, which is only used to send out emergency alerts.   Claiming they are spying on you through this is akin to claiming that the State of Union is secretly a ploy to catch terrorists."
ThanksObama,24p66w,Aperture_Scientist4,1 point,Tue May 6 03:29:05 2014 UTC,"Perception:  Members of Congress and media figures have questioned the motivations behind the Justice Department's actions, and if they were even warranted: ""For five days, reporters at the Associated Press had been sitting on a big scoop about a foiled Al-Qaeda plot at the request of CIA officials. Then, in a hastily scheduled Monday morning meeting, the journalists were asked by agency officials to hold off on publishing the story for just one more day. The CIA officials, who had initially cited national security concerns in an attempt to delay publication, no longer had those worries, according to individuals familiar with the exchange. Instead, the Obama administration was planning to announce the successful counterterrorism operation that Tuesday. AP balked and proceeded to publish that Monday afternoon.""[27]  On June 19, 2013, while giving a speech at the National Press Club, President and CEO of the Associated Press Gary Pruitt said: “Some longtime trusted sources have become nervous and anxious about talking with us — even on stories unrelated to national security. In some cases, government employees we once checked in with regularly will no longer speak to us by phone. Others are reluctant to meet in person... And I can tell you, that this chilling effect on newsgathering is not just limited to AP. Journalists from other news organizations have personally told me, that it has intimidated both official and nonofficial sources from speaking to them as well.”[28]  That is just one blatant, obvious mess of corruption the list would be exhaustive when it comes to data intrusion alone, NSA, etc.  The Associated Press essentially had a pre-made story that they were ""going to publish"", AP's intentions to publish a story on a CIA operation which prevented the Yemeni terrorist Fahd al-Quso's plot to detonate an explosive device on a commercial flight. The AP basically made a trip wire to see if the CIA was going to fall for it. There should have been no possible way to for the CIA to have known what AP was going write, or what stories they had placed away.   ""The AP claimed these acts were a ""massive and unprecedented intrusion"" into news-gathering operations.[3][4] Gary Pruitt, CEO of the Associated Press stated: ""These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering operations and disclose information about AP's activities and operations *that the government has no conceivable right to know*.""  Oh but because I have concern over the massive, intrusion of my privacy I'm labeled a tin foiling hat wearing conspiracy nut.  ""If you give up your freedom for safety, you don't deserve either one."""
ThanksObama,24p66w,imsomlgprolike4reel,1 point,Tue May 6 05:34:18 2014 UTC,"Why are concerned about THIS invasion of your privacy?  Again, all it does is send a message out.   Yes it's mandatory, but that has nothing to do with the NSA, it's Presidential action that made it mandatory. And really this is the kind of thing Id want mandatory, so everyone in this US would know immediately if say Russia declared war on Alaska."
ThanksObama,24p66w,Aperture_Scientist4,0,Tue May 6 11:28:15 2014 UTC,"Why are concerned about THIS invasion of your privacy?   This is why... Fact: NSA monitors practically every communication medium when they should only being targeting mediums or sources where data would assist in the protection against terrorism, and other national threats. Tracking the data of every single American is illegal, and fundamentally against the constitutional rights of Americans  Having a sense of privacy is a human right, well within the U.S. it is. Or else the / any government can, and will push the boundaries to monitor what anyone says, or does. A good read is 1984 by George Orwell. If the above AP story alone, and the previous fact I mentioned above don't raise even a small amount of questions on the intrusion of government in your life... it's hard to really help. I can give more examples of this but it is exhaustive."
ThanksObama,24p66w,imsomlgprolike4reel,0,Tue May 6 20:55:20 2014 UTC,"I understand that. Really, I do. But all this is is a means of sending a mass text message.   I never directly made my reply in context to the actual function of the mass text message service itself.   It is IMPOSSIBLE to attach code or other secret programs to a text message service--the text message encoding mechanism can only encode very small data packets, hence the character limit on texts. If a program tried to be sent over the text service the cell tower would reject it and force you to download it via internet or something.   I never said anything about the mass texting messaging service itself. My question is what is there intent for this? Why does it have to be mandatory? Why can I not opt out? We have a hundreds of news organizations that can easily, and more efficiently report a terrorist, nuclear, or whatever the heck disaster just as much as a federal alert could possibly do. It's not impossible to side-load or make carriers have a baked background into Android itself. Especially when that feature of Presidential alerts got implemented like last year or so over the air into Android 4.2.x / 4.3, etc.   As you cannot write a wire tapping program in 160 characters, the government is not spying on you by SENDING you texts.   Specifically speaking that doesn't make any sense because I wasn't implying that the government would use a text message character slot to write active code. One would need to compile it, and have it already implemented entirely. It's like saying one can execute active code in the YouTube comment's section; from my infinitely unprofessional, and limited understanding of programming -- that's not how it works in any way.    More importantly, the government has no reason to wiretap this service as they SENT the message--they already know what it says.   Again, my concern of what they're sending out was not what I was implying. Your notion is on the text messaging communications itself, which is old, antiquated, and beyond limited. My concern is what need is it to make it mandatory, and... is it just for mockery? A tease that hey, 'we the government are getting more involved in your lives whether you like it or not?'   Yes the NSA is in your computer, stealin' your internets, but they are not doing through this service, which is only used to send out emergency alerts.   Stealing my internets? That doesn't make sense. Like I said before, which redditers / redditors love to ignore, and close their ears too; Fact: NSA monitors practically every communication medium when they should only being targeting mediums or sources where data would assist in the protection against terrorism, and other national threats. Tracking the data of every single American is illegal, and fundamentally against the constitutional rights of Americans.   Claiming they are spying on you through this is akin to claiming that the State of Union is secretly a ploy to catch terrorists.   Well we're not too far from the reality of that. It's not about ""claiming"", or getting all hyped up over things that are not fully known. It's a fact the government is collecting massive amounts of data that's more than personally identifiable, and much of that data is unneeded, and irrelevant for any possible specific reason they could ever come up with.  It's hard to explain my concern over the issue of that feature without one realizing that A. the NSA is (copy n' pasted for you) Fact: NSA monitors practically every communication medium when they should only being targeting mediums or sources where data would assist in the protection against terrorism, and other national threats. Tracking the data of every single American is illegal, and fundamentally against the constitutional rights of Americans.  and B. the current administration is breaking so many laws, and is so corrupt it's hard to even begin to summarize everything all in one small tiny package. I hate to bring politics into this but if that's what's needed to help explain to others who cannot possibly see the concern I'm more than glad to. Lets take a look at the Associated Press...  Straight from Wiki: On May 13, 2013, the Associated Press announced telephone records for 20 of their reporters during a two-month period in 2012 had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. AP reported the Justice Department would not say why it sought the records, but news sources noted the US Attorney's office for the District of Columbia was conducting a criminal investigation into a May 7, 2012, AP story about a CIA operation which prevented the Yemeni terrorist Fahd al-Quso's plot to detonate an explosive device on a commercial flight.[1] The DOJ did not direct subpoenas to the Associated Press; instead, the subpoenas were issued to their telephone providers, including Verizon Wireless.[2]  The AP claimed these acts were a ""massive and unprecedented intrusion"" into news-gathering operations.[3][4] Gary Pruitt, CEO of the Associated Press stated: ""These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering operations and disclose information about AP's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know.""[5][6]  The US Attorney's office in Washington responded that federal investigators seek records from news outlets only after making ""every reasonable effort to obtain information through alternative means.""[5] Verizon neither challenged the subpoena nor did it try to alert the journalists whose records were being requested. Debra Lewis, Verizon Wireless spokeswoman, said the company ""complies with legal processes for requests for information by law enforcement.""[7]  and...  Prosecutions during the Obama Administration's tenure:  To date, seven Americans working for the U.S. Government or government contractors with security clearances have faced criminal charges under the Espionage Act of 1917 because of alleged leaks to members of the press or online outlets during the Obama Administration's tenure:[11]  Shamai Leibowitz, a contract linguist for the FBI, was convicted of leaking information to a blogger from embassy wiretaps in 2010.[19] Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA employee, was indicted for allegedly revealing classified information to journalist James Risen in 2011.[20] John Kiriakou, a former CIA analyst, pleaded guilty to passing classified information to a reporter in 2013.[21] Bradley Manning, an US Army intelligence analyst, pleaded guilty to passing classified information to the Wikileaks organization in 2013.[22] Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, a senior analyst at the Office of National Security at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, was charged with disclosing national defense information to reporter James Rosen in 2010.[23] Thomas Drake, a former National Security Agency senior executive, was charged with willful retention of national defense information. The charges were dismissed on the eve of his trial in 2010.[24] Edward Snowden, a technical contractor for the NSA and former employee of the CIA, in Russian exile as of 2014, has been charged with theft and the unauthorized disclosure of classified information to columnist Glenn Greenwald and other media outlets in 2013.[25] Justice Department officials have made the distinction, that they do not target whistle-blowers, instead, those who knowingly disclose classified information to others without security clearance: ""An individual in authorized possession of classified information has no authority or right to unilaterally determine, that it should be made public or otherwise disclose it.”[26]  and...  cont."

I still get what you are saying about the NSA--the ""stealin your internets"" was a joke referencing an old meme for when someone was spying on you.   I also agree that there may be hidden programs on the Android that help spy.   I don't understand why you are concerned over this. Can you explain to me why you think this feature is dangerous--not why the NSA as a whole is dangerous, but this specific feature.   I apologize if you've already explained this, I've got two finals today so my brains not in top gear atm."

Can you explain to me why you think this feature is dangerous--not why the NSA as a whole is dangerous, but this specific feature.   Personally I don't believe this specific feature is doing anything that what it says itself. But I question why they put in out of nowhere. Is it to fly in the face of those that do know that the government uses broad surveillance? Almost as an inside joke. That's the only thing. I don't think it specifically does anything nefarious.   I also agree that there may be hidden programs on the Android that help spy.   I can't find it but there was a YouTube video showing how one person was able to find out how some rogue service was able to log all your key-presses and send it out. This was concerning specifically Verizon. I never followed up on that one though."

ThanksObama,23a8t5,detecting_nuttiness,2,Fri Apr 18 04:36:36 2014 UTC,"Yeap! You know how people call facial tissues ""Kleenex"", we call it a Bubbler instead of a drinking/water fountain.  Here's a quick wiki on it:  In the United States, drinking fountains were built from 1889 by the then-small Kohler Water Works (now Kohler Company) in Kohler, Wisconsin, a company already established as a faucet producer.The original 'Bubbler' shot water one inch straight into the air, creating a bubbling texture, and the excess water ran back down over the sides of the nozzle...  ...A survey of US dialects undertaken between 2002 and 2004 found the word bubbler commonly used in southern and eastern Wisconsin and in Rhode Island and eastern Massachusetts.   I don't know why not many other people use bubbler, it's a great word."

Most of the time in school lunches, it's a tiny carton on milk, and they get one. I'm pretty sure that having one chocolate milk a day at lunch isn't going to give them the beetus."
ThanksObama,23a8t5,WastedPanda,2,Thu Apr 17 22:18:02 2014 UTC,"As a person that both drank chocolate milk at lunch exclusively, I'm very confused...  I wrestled and dieted a lot...so blaming food on gaining weigh is ridiculous. I was never fat or even close and my school served french fries everyday with everything. What you eat is much less of a problem than how much is eaten. By removing choices and telling children those choices make them fat, we set the children up for failure with lies; the fact is those choices do not make them fat, but they should better regulate the amount taken in and to be more active, but no, it's easier to just not allow them to make an informed choice."
ThanksObama,23a8t5,7x5x3x2x2,7,Thu Apr 17 23:59:03 2014 UTC,"Neither is one burger, one pizza, or one doughnut for breakfast.

ThanksObama,23a8t5,TheSystem_IsDown,6,Fri Apr 18 12:22:42 2014 UTC,"It's not ONLY because of fatty school lunches though. It's because their lifestyles are shit. They get out of school, go home, and either watch shit tv, play video games, or use the internet.  A little carton of chocolate milk isn't really hurting, and taking that away is just going to lead kids to either sneak in, or bring in their own soda, which is considerably worse."

It's more, "" You know it's not the chocolate milk, I know it's not the chocolate milk, the kids schooldays already fucking sucks, let them have the chocolate milk and address REAL reasons for obesity "" is what I was trying to get at, you know? rather than making their shitty schoolday even shittier, and make them likely to learn even less from being miserable, why not start pointing blame at parents that let their kid come home and sit on their ass 5 - 10 hours straight on videogames/internet/while texting."

Instead of a quick and painless death by god-fearing, gun-toting honest hardworking Americans, you'll be forced to listen to an endless loop of charismatic speeches until you're driven insane (which by then Obamacare will cover as an 'induced-terminal' condition, meaning you then get the chair).  Pretty soon appreciation will be required between every word, then every syllable. Eventually they'll just replace every word in every language (Remember Obama's plan to overrun America with literally every immigrant in the world) with different patterns of ""Thanks"" and ""Obama"" so no utterance goes without paying tribute to the man who made it all happen.

ThanksObama,21bogp,NathanAlexMcCarty,6,Wed Mar 26 04:53:22 2014 UTC,"This is because IE no longer calls itself IE anymore.  The user agent string, the string browsers send to the servers to identify themselves, that IE has underwent changes in its structure starting with IE 11.   IE 11 has the following user agent string:  Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) like Gecko   Where as IE 10 had the following:  Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/6.0)   Microsoft has decided that IE11 has advanced so much, and can do more, that they decided to remove the MSIE (MicroSoft Internet Explorer) token from the user agent string, which means that applications that were relying on the user agent string to tell when you were using IE no longer recognize it.   User agent strings are a giant fucking mess in the first place, and in the end every browser is pretending to be Netscape, just in a different way than all the others. (Note: Mozilla, the mosaic killer, was renamed netscape for part of its life, because the guys who made mosaic were mad) And yes, the reason browsers pretend to be Netscape involves internet explorer."

ThanksObama,21bogp,not_a_Dr,2,Wed Mar 26 06:44:22 2014 UTC,".mil is your main problem. These are the same people who want you to use IE 8 or older and run some unexplained script as an administrator to install their root certificates systemwide. I always had a feeling, in my conspiratarded mind, that they do this do be able to perform a man in the middle on any serviceman they suspect of something nefarious.   Think about it, mypay.dfas.mil, a site frequented by DoD civilians, uses a cert from VeriSign. Why should the other military sites use their own CA? The only reasons I can think of are costs and the ability to spy on their own. We can throw costs out the window because the military loves spending money. That leaves us with man in the middle. This kind of makes sense. They insist you use an old browser and then they provide an ""InstallRoot"" script to install their certificates system-wide. Something is pretty damn fishy, no?"
ThanksObama,21bogp,noobit,3,Tue Mar 25 17:53:52 2014 UTC,"Wow, put your tinfoil hat away. They're just shitty sites. The contracting companies that the government spends money on like making money too so they keep costs low by doing bare minimum work to increase profits. Also most contracts are for sustainment, meaning, they aren't legally allowed to improve the site, only bug fixes to keep it running. Any major changes to the code would be considered 'new work' and there isn't any money in the budget for it."
ThanksObama,21bogp,Manadox,1 point,Wed Mar 26 00:18:36 2014 UTC,"I agree they're shitty sites, but they were created at a time when IE was known to be shit, and they still require you to trust the Army's root cert.

ThanksObama,21bogp,AnotherClosetAtheist,2,Wed Mar 26 01:53:44 2014 UTC,"I'm fairly open to conspiracy theories (more and more as time goes on, it seems) but having said that: You'd need deeper proof of this than just the feeling that something's fishy.  Having worked with companies with archaic 'workflows' that break at even the tiniest of updates (not critically... just enough to justify sticking to the older version rather than refactoring your code to suit the new version), I can assure you that there is nothing inherently strange/suspicious to be stuck to obsolete browsers even as the actual release is 2-4 versions ahead."
ThanksObama,21bogp,AnotherClosetAtheist,2,Sun Mar 30 13:39:17 2014 UTC,"I understand that, but I think the important thing to note is that these policies--especially installing a government CA systemwide--are dangerous, and they make attacks trivial."

ThanksObama,20t57c,aquasharp,15,Wed Mar 19 14:42:35 2014 UTC,"Pretty sure it's the exact opposite of that, IE he wants to finish the penny forevermore."
ThanksObama,20t57c,Bucklar,5,Wed Mar 19 16:11:09 2014 UTC,It's a dumb currency. Unless you can buy things for a penny there's no reason to have it. I think the nickel and dimes are dumb too.
ThanksObama,20t57c,aquasharp,9,Wed Mar 19 16:59:01 2014 UTC,"Dimes are a necessity. Nobody's gonna go for rounding to the nearest quarter-dollar, but rounding to the nearest tenth is reasonable."
ThanksObama,20t57c,Litotes,1 point,Wed Mar 19 17:57:22 2014 UTC,Why round? Making something 2.99 is just a marketing scheme anyway. Just make it an even price and move on. Tax is what makes it way* more dumb.
ThanksObama,20t57c,aquasharp,4,Wed Mar 19 18:21:05 2014 UTC,"I was referring to rounding after taxes, not the display price."
ThanksObama,20t57c,Litotes,11,Wed Mar 19 18:23:09 2014 UTC,They should display the price after tax like all the other countries do. Just make the price $3 period instead of labeling it 2.66 and adding the tax during the pos.
ThanksObama,20t57c,aquasharp,3,Wed Mar 19 18:48:29 2014 UTC,It's because not all states have sales taxes
ThanksObama,20t57c,a_demon_ninja,6,Wed Mar 19 18:59:09 2014 UTC,Then make it 2.75.

ThanksObama,20t57c,OrpheusDaCreator,0,Thu Mar 20 06:15:02 2014 UTC,Well then just still keep it at $3.
ThanksObama,20t57c,Teelo888,3,Thu Mar 20 01:58:42 2014 UTC,"I don't disagree that it's a pointless unit of currency in the 21st century. My country got rid of them last year, we're better off for it.  Can't say the same for nickles and dimes, but I'm poor enough that I actually have some use for nickles and dimes..."
ThanksObama,20t57c,Bucklar,5,Wed Mar 19 17:53:42 2014 UTC,"But if we get rid of those, how will corporations nickel-and-dime us?  Couldn't resist the dad joke lol"
ThanksObama,20t57c,HiTechObsessed,0,Wed Mar 19 22:14:17 2014 UTC,"Okay, so you want to abolish the dime, nickle, and penny.  So what if you want to buy just one piece of Bazooka bubblegum? Typically 5 cents.  Or if you get or give a 10% discount for merchandise? Would you expect credit card companies and banks' debit cards and accounts to display in quarter-dollars, as well?  The lower currency can also serve as an emergency replacement for the higher, just as 5 pennies can replace a nickel if you run out of nickels, what happens if you have no quarters and you can not use dimes and nickels to replace it?"
ThanksObama,20t57c,kinyutaka,3,Wed Mar 19 18:58:59 2014 UTC,They took away the penny in Canada about a year ago. At first I thought it was stupid but now I think its awesome.  I never used pennies anways.

I think it was human error. Night flights cause disorientation and theres a chance they may have fallen into a graveyard spiral. That may explain why it looked to turn back a bit. Either that or simply something mechanical going wrong to cause it to basically fall out of the sky. Time will tell though, purely speculation."

I had to cut it hard when turning because I drive a van and I didn't want to hit the car in the outer lane.  SECOND time I was in a turn lane, turning right. I was actually driving in the turn lane, as there was a red light and we have long turn lanes. Some dude went from a dead standstill and made an illegal right turn into the turn lane without checking his mirrors, turning right into me and running me off the road. The motherfucker gets out, asked me why I hit him, and starts getting all pissed when he had a fucking eye patch on his right eye.  Police came, this sweet old lady stopped and acted as a witness, and the eye patch dude was found to be at fault. But the shitty part was that my front passenger tired was shredded because his SUV forced me over to the right, and subsequently into another fucked up storm drain."

The new Cherokee looks like a Kia or something and one would never guess that it's a Jeep.  The Wrangler is another good example of an instantly identifiable vehicle that looks nearly identical to its older versions."
ThanksObama,1z04z5,chjode,11,Fri Feb 28 00:44:02 2014 UTC,"Ever seen the newest Wrangler? How about a 60's Jeep CJ (basically the vehicle that became the Wrangler)?

ThanksObama,1z04z5,Broduski,3,Thu Feb 27 01:36:57 2014 UTC,"I know that, but like the Wrangler, it's possible to update the Cherokee and keep similar styling. I think most people hate that it looks more like a RAV-4 than the classic Cherokee, and it's front wheel drive based, which  makes it much less desirable for anyone who wants an off-road vehicle. The classic Cherokee is desirable for off-road use because it is rugged, easy to work on, and modify. The new Cherokee is the opposite."
ThanksObama,1z04z5,JMS1991,-6,Thu Feb 27 02:07:01 2014 UTC,"Yeah, And what's the point of a new (Old style) Cherokee when the 4 door hardtop JK exists?"

The Jeep full size Wagoneer was in production from the mid sixties until 1992, and it had no major redesigns throughout its production.  Different grilles, taillights, interiors, and drivetrain options, but otherwise the same body and frame.   Wouldn't be easy to do these days, since safety and emissions standards have changed so much more quickly since then."

ThanksObama,1xmkua,Spineless_John,1 point,Tue Feb 11 21:44:42 2014 UTC,"Kal Penn:      Kal Penn (born Kalpen Suresh Modi; April 23, 1977) is an American actor, producer, and civil servant.  As an actor, he is known for his role portraying Dr. Lawrence Kutner on the television program House, as well as the character Kumar Patel in the Harold & Kumar film series. He is also recognized for his performance in the critically acclaimed film, The Namesake. Additionally, Penn has taught at the University of Pennsylvania in the Cinema Studies Program as a visiting lecturer.  On April 8, 2009, it was announced that Penn would join the Obama administration as an Associate Director in the White House Office of Public Engagement. This necessitated that his character, Lawrence Kutner, be written out of the TV series House. Penn resigned his post as Barack Obama's Associate Director of Public Engagement on June 1, 2010, for a brief return to his acting career. He filmed the third installment of the Harold & Kumar series, A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas, and subsequently returned to the White House Office of Public Engagement as an Associate Director. In July 2011, he again left the White House to accept a role in the hit television series How I Met Your Mother. He has since returned to his role with the White House.

ThanksObama,1xd48n,Gil_V,28,Sat Feb 8 17:15:17 2014 UTC,They're not supposed to occur at all if you've properly tossed the dough.   Source: former dough tosser.
ThanksObama,1xd48n,Belleex,5,Sat Feb 8 19:35:04 2014 UTC,"Tell me more, please. I may learn something today - in spite of myself!"
ThanksObama,1xd48n,Gil_V,19,Sat Feb 8 19:37:58 2014 UTC,"Sure! I worked at two pizza places. The first one was pretty lazy about how they prevented the problem, and used pre-sized dough that we just stretched a bit and ran a spiked rolling pin thing over a bunch of times. I feel like that left the pizza crust a little stale compared to where I worked the second time, which tossed their pizza dough like most Italian pizzerias would. (And we'd still have holes form in between the holes that we'd ran into the dough)   When you form the dough, work on a clean, floured surface, and pinch one side of the dough to roll it, and pound the dough on the floured surface to make a tight, dense, round ball with the pinched side on the bottom. Let it rise for about 30-60 minutes. Then you have to roll it out to a decent enough size to fit your hands in the center and be able to pull it out. Feel free to work it down with your hands if you don't have a rolling pin, just be prepared to do a little extra stretching.   That's the key to breaking up the bubbles, you pull from the center of the dough with your hands, breaking up the bubbles that have formed in the dough by the yeast. As you go, the process is made easier if you rely on the momentum of spinning the dough in the air…if you feel confident in your ability to catch it, or are sufficiently lax (either it's immaculate or you don't care) about the state of your kitchen floor… go ahead and give it a toss: I start by crossing my wrists under the dough, using my fingers to prop up the inside of the dough, like a tent, and…if you remember Dragon Flyz™ or Sky Dancers™, give it that sort of momentum when you release the dough in the air (although, I recall even jumping a little to get my Sky Dancer in the air higher…). DO NOT catch the dough by sticking your hands straight in the air to reach it. Let it fall back on your fingers, letting your hands help to break the momentum slowly. It's pretty easy to make holes in your dough if you meet it with rigid fingers. Repeat, until dough is of necessary size for your pizza pan."
ThanksObama,1xd48n,Belleex,2,Sat Feb 8 20:07:15 2014 UTC,Alternately you can roll the dough out and use a docker or knife to poke tiny holes in the dough.  I prefer a less dense dough so tossing is out of the question.

ThanksObama,1wyghv,lvii22,8,Tue Feb 4 17:51:01 2014 UTC,I had the exact same bottle opener and it snapped after a 6 pack. That thing is completely useless.  My bottle openers worked fine under Bush
ThanksObama,1wyghv,J37hr0,2,Tue Feb 4 15:26:16 2014 UTC,You could have just used the counter. But opening a bottle with a lighter is the most useful skill I learned at a Grateful Dead parking lot.
ThanksObama,1wyghv,Anaphase,4,Tue Feb 4 05:03:09 2014 UTC,Opening it on the counter is likely to fuck up your counter.

ThanksObama,1wyghv,skeletorcares,3,Tue Feb 4 05:23:11 2014 UTC,Ever had the opposite happen? The opener breaks off the top of the bottle? That's even worse because the beer has glass in it. When will it stop Obama?

ThanksObama,1wuqmq,sysadminwannabe,56,Mon Feb 3 02:53:04 2014 UTC,Pleasantly
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,th3byrdm4n,5,Mon Feb 3 03:51:24 2014 UTC,... uhh . . .
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,jjspaceman,-1,Mon Feb 3 03:17:25 2014 UTC,RHCP couldn't play more than the one song because just the one song highlighted the NFL's mistake in not picking them over Mars.
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,th3byrdm4n,5,Mon Feb 3 05:50:45 2014 UTC,"No way.  Bruno Mars = the relevant choice. The show was great.  The energy was palpable...   RHCP is, of course, great; but putting up the old guys w/ old material gets... old."
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,jjspaceman,0,Mon Feb 3 21:01:06 2014 UTC,"As I said in another comment, I love RHCP and don't care for Bruno Mars at all. As for old material, RHCP has plenty of new material they could have played, but oh well. To each their own."
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,jjspaceman,-2,Mon Feb 3 22:27:00 2014 UTC,"Oh please, both are amazing artists/groups and it wouldn't if mattered who was who either way."
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,PeterCorbin,0,Mon Feb 3 18:21:33 2014 UTC,"Big RHCP fan here and not a Mars fan at all, so obviously I would have to disagree with your assessment, but to each their own."

ThanksObama,1wuqmq,KittenStapler,-1,Tue Feb 4 20:06:30 2014 UTC,"Since John Frusciante lieft they really can't play a lot of the By the Way or Stadium Arcadium stuff because that dude was just insane, like hard drug fueled guitar insane.   Nothing against the new guitarist but he just can't play the great stuff.  That's why they were relegated to playing something like Give it Away, which is very vocals drums and bass oriented.  Gotta hide that guitar weakness."
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,th3byrdm4n,7,Mon Feb 3 16:24:21 2014 UTC,John was actually sober during the By the Way and Stadium Arcadium era. Blood Sugar Sex Magik was when his addiction was at its worst.  Josh is a phenomenal guitarist despite all the flak he gets. And the only reason they played Give it Away is because everyone recognizes it and it gets people off their feet.
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,TheBullshitPatrol,2,Mon Feb 3 18:48:55 2014 UTC,"I hadn't kept up with RHCP, but this affirms my initial theory on the song choice... John Frusciante is a nutso great talent.. /shrug"
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,FarrokhDoesntApprove,5,Mon Feb 3 20:53:40 2014 UTC,"I hate the new guitarist, his style just doesn't fit with the rest of the band."
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,borumlive,1 point,Mon Feb 3 18:23:24 2014 UTC,"Josh has been touring with them for years now, so I'm not quite sure what you're getting at.  I'm a huge John Frusciante dickrider, and I can still comfortably say that he emulates him very well.  If anything, the main thing we've lost is John's background vocals from Stadium Arcadium.  I'm only half kidding.  I've listened to John play this fucking song a million times; Josh does it just as well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q288L0j3eOs&t=38m28s"

ThanksObama,1wuqmq,thyrst,31,Mon Feb 3 04:54:46 2014 UTC,I think Bruno Mars did a good job. But I wanted to see RHCP. Honestly I think it should have been one or the other. It would have been cool either way.
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,rcavin1118,6,Mon Feb 3 03:34:37 2014 UTC,"I wish there was at least two songs. I was glad to have them perform during, regardless."

ThanksObama,1wuqmq,headless_bourgeoisie,18,Mon Feb 3 10:25:31 2014 UTC,"I agree, the whole time up to the halftime show I was thinking ""fuckin Bruno Mars, what a terrible choice"" but that dude fuckin kills it live. Completely changed my opinion of him."

ThanksObama,1wuqmq,trollinwithdagnomies,2,Mon Feb 3 04:32:12 2014 UTC,What song
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,Elementium,7,Mon Feb 3 19:03:11 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I thought that was pretty fucking bullshit.  I was excited to see them play.  Would have been cool to see a lineup of a BSSM song, a Californication song, and a Stadium Arcadium song."
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,b0r3d1,4,Mon Feb 3 22:13:25 2014 UTC,Exactly. I was so disappointed when the only did one song.
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,hatedatbirth,1 point,Mon Feb 3 03:12:31 2014 UTC,No By the Way?
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,Assburgers_And_Coke,2,Mon Feb 3 03:17:58 2014 UTC,"By the Way didn't do it for me.  It was more commercially successful than SA, but I just didn't like the content.  I'm a HUGE RHCP fan, listened to everything they have, and I wouldn't be able to list anything off the top of my head that I REALLY like off By the Way except maybe Can't Stop.  We'll see what the future has in store for them, but for now, Stadium Arcadium is my favorite album, both of theirs, and in general.  I could listen through it track for track over and over again."
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,hatedatbirth,2,Mon Feb 3 05:54:00 2014 UTC,They've been going downhill since Californication.  I loved One Hot Minute.  I feel like I'm the only person that wasn't happy when Frusciante came back.
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,c0ldsh0w3r,2,Mon Feb 3 06:03:35 2014 UTC,"If some one who listens to them a lot compiles a guide to listen to RHCP and post it to /r/music, I bet they'll get a lot of karma for that."
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,long_live_king_melon,2,Mon Feb 3 10:45:26 2014 UTC,"The Half-Time show was great. I thought Bruno Mars did a great job, and thankfully the RHCPs played an older, actually good song instead of anything they have written in the last 15 years."
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,RadioActyve,2,Mon Feb 3 09:29:19 2014 UTC,Its better than LMFAO and Madonna. I actually thought bruno didn't do too bad.
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,Peterod,1 point,Mon Feb 3 15:23:20 2014 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of either, but I did think they were odd picks for the halftime show, especially together. I had heard Bruno was great live, and he thoroughly entertained me (or maybe that was just in comparison to the game). I just don't think the Bruno RHCH duet fit together. I was surprised when they went back to just Bruno, but glad..."
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,jesh_wa415,1 point,Mon Feb 3 18:33:56 2014 UTC,They probably cut the half time show short so they could all get the game over with.
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,Peterod,0,Mon Feb 3 20:38:52 2014 UTC,"One was more than enough, sure they tune halftime to the 40 somethings, but damn.  They've done fuck all since under the bridge, and they're fucking pointless."
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,DammitDan,2,Mon Feb 3 22:06:34 2014 UTC,Peppers can't play half their best stuff because John F. is no longer around.
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,Peterod,2,Mon Feb 3 09:48:34 2014 UTC,You're underestimating Josh's skills as a guitarist. If they wanted to play another song they would have.
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,irishguy42,0,Mon Feb 3 06:20:28 2014 UTC,"Maybe a little, but John Frusciante plugs his guitar directly into his heart. No other mechanized sound pulls my soul around like a rag doll like his."
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,Peterod,-5,Mon Feb 3 09:55:50 2014 UTC,Red Hot Chili Peppers are still a thing? Wish they'd stay in the 90's where they belong...
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,DammitDan,4,Mon Feb 3 21:37:49 2014 UTC,"Well besides the fact that they started in 83' yes they're still around, and producing good music."
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,Peterod,1 point,Mon Feb 3 10:04:50 2014 UTC,no
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,WheresTheSauce,-18,Mon Feb 3 15:51:05 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I think Bruno Mars did an awful job. He sounded like shit live. But you know what they say about opinions and assholes..."
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,Peterod,29,Mon Feb 3 14:36:49 2014 UTC,Awful is a hell of a strong word. Black Eyed Peas were awful.
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,RadioActyve,3,Mon Feb 3 04:59:54 2014 UTC,That I can agree with 100%.
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,Peterod,13,Mon Feb 3 05:33:27 2014 UTC,"Then your TV speakers must be pieces of shit.  His vocals were about as perfect as you can get without prerecording.  He was singing in an outdoor stadium in the dead of winter in a northern state, and his intonation was impeccable. If you don't like the guy or his music, then that's your opinion.  But there's no denying that his performance was executed pretty much perfectly."
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,jawknee21,-5,Mon Feb 3 13:58:34 2014 UTC,He didn't sound anything like he does in his songs. Maybe I'm just a little mad still that Bruno Mars of all people was chosen to do the halftime show. But there's no denying that everyone in the room watching the game said he was awful and loved the Chilli Peppers performance.
ThanksObama,1wuqmq,Hillside_Strangler,5,Mon Feb 3 10:53:42 2014 UTC,I think he was chosen because he is an excellent stage performer and he is very talented.  He's essentially the Prince/MJ of his time.

[...]  The Administration’s uncertain responses to foreign policy challenges in Libya, Egypt, Syria, and Iran, among others, have reduced U.S. influence [...] Implementation of the health care law passed in 2010 has hit major snags and appears to be significantly hurting job creation and full-time employment.

ThanksObama,1tc81b,Scuttlebuttz93,16,Fri Dec 20 22:30:50 2013 UTC,Six months? Only if you're smoking 81 blunts a day. When I was getting high once or twice a day not factoring in sharing I'd only go through a quarter ounce every month.
ThanksObama,1tc81b,Jake0024,5,Fri Dec 20 22:47:24 2013 UTC,When I'm smoking I'll go through a quarter ounce a week. And I don't feel like I'm being excessive about it.

ThanksObama,1t6fz2,InvalidZod,116,Thu Dec 19 08:59:01 2013 UTC,Not sure why you got downvoted. A direct link to the C&H Page gives them ad revenue and website hits.   That being said; http://www.explosm.net/comics/3059/
ThanksObama,1t6fz2,knockaroundglass,5,Thu Dec 19 11:35:49 2013 UTC,I know of at least one web comic creator who requests their content not be direct linked because the Reddit DDoS destroys their bandwidth allowance.

Swords are just dramaticized because they are ""sexy"", when in reality a soldier's fest weapon of choice would have rarely been that."
ThanksObama,1t6fz2,e4excellence,1 point,Thu Dec 19 02:56:12 2013 UTC,"Dyancat hi the nail on the head. Swords in the majority of cases were backup weapons. They are sidearms,  not main battle rifles.  Moreover, some swords are well made and some are poorly made, but quality of build would only be very evident in the reliability of the weapon rather than the ability. An ulfberht-made sword may have been able to hold an edge somewhat longer or be less likely to bend, but that wouldn't be dramatically reflected in the killing ability of the weapon."

ThanksObama,1st9q2,mborgel1,6,Sat Dec 14 08:08:26 2013 UTC,"No, we can't blame a specific event on climate change. What you have to look at is the overall data worldwide and see if there has been an increase in events like that. There is concern that increases in global mean temperature (and the resulting variety of changes in climate systems) will lead to an increase in climate variability and therefore an increase in extreme weather events.  Here's the relevant section of the 2007 IPCC report, which synthesizes and summarizes data on climate change. I'm going to be honest and say I didn't read the whole section, as it's pretty dense."

ThanksObama,1st9q2,FAP-FOR-BRAINS,-1,Thu Dec 19 05:52:23 2013 UTC,It is because he has appointed himself Grandmaster and Big Kahuna of the fraudulent 'global warming' fad that earns him millions.

You claim you have ""an opposing view"", but that is arrogance on your part.   You have an opinion based on ignorance that is disagreed with my 97% of the people in the world that disagree with you.   It's not your opinion, your interpretation of the facts we (liberals) find abhorrent, it's the complete lack of reasoning behind it.   It's the arrogant stupidity that convinces you that your opinion is somehow valid when it's not.   It's embarrassing to see.   Like a Down syndrome kid screaming for more cake at a children's party.   That's what you you look like.

That school led to others which were taught the same signs although, there are still some signs in each state and sometimes each city that are different.

ThanksObama,1sk74x,TrolleyPower,8,Tue Dec 10 18:45:05 2013 UTC,"Ok, very edgy. Good for you.  I get that UK Redditors hate Cameron, but this is not even a remotely fair comparison.  Cameron's government has just legalised gay marriage. Ted Cruz thinks gays deserve to burn in hell. One is a centre right realist, the other a religious fantasist.   Ahh, but what am I saying - this is Reddit! So fuck it - David Cameron uses the poor as kindling for his massive posh fire!! Spread the good word!!"
ThanksObama,1sk74x,tramperp,3,Wed Dec 11 00:27:11 2013 UTC,"No, I agree with you, it's absolutely unfair to Cameron.  Some of his ideas are very puzzling to me but I don't think of him in the same breath as Cruz."

I would not put them in the same league, but that does not make Cameron exempt from criticism.

ThanksObama,1shtv3,Aurigarion,3,Tue Dec 10 01:55:05 2013 UTC,"The ""runtime"" it's talking about the is the Visual C++ Runtime, which contains a bunch of stuff that a lot of program need to run.  In this case, it looks like one program has a bug which causes it to crash, and the C++ Runtime closes the program forcefully.  If you have a program that never seems to work right, or something of questionable software quality (e.g. programmed by some 14 year old on his mom's computer), that would be a likely culprit; good software shouldn't run into problems like that.  If it's not causing any problems that you're noticing, you can just ignore it; at worst it just means that one program isn't running right.  If it's showing up a lot, or keeps coming back after you click OK, then you should spend some time looking for the program that's causing it."

ThanksObama,1r5p2y,etherghost,2,Fri Nov 22 11:30:49 2013 UTC,"what is Jesse so angry about? let's check the score at that point of the series:   Money: Walt has made Jesse rich beyond his wildest dreams People: Angela and Brock? safe and sound. Sure, there was the poison thing, but it didn't really hurt Brock. Safety: he has made it much safer now that they run the whole thing, their lives not hanging anymore on the whims of Gus   if anything, Jesse just keeps ruining EVERYTHING in the series OVER AND OVER with his constant rebelling against Walt's guidance, despite Walt REPEATEDLY saving Jesse's life at the risk of his own. And Jane would be alive if, again, Jesse had listened to Walt."
ThanksObama,1r5p2y,the_demon_hunter,1 point,Mon Nov 25 00:24:15 2013 UTC,"THIS COMMENT CONTAINS MAJOR BREAKING BAD SPOILERS DON'T READ IT IF YOU HAVEN'T COMPLETELY FINISHED THE SHOW.  Hmm. Interesting perspective, but I think I disagree. Walt is a bad person. He kills with no remorse like it's nothing, and is willing to go to extremes to manipulate anyone, even those closest to him. I'll review the points you made.   Money: Jesse doesn't seem to care as much about money as Walt does. In the beginning of the series, he was filled with childlike giddiness when he made his first hundred thousand, but by the end it meant so little to him that he was just throwing it on the street and giving it to people he didn't know. Now, you might dismiss this by saying ""Well Walt tried to burn all his money on the grill that obviously didn't mean that he didn't care about money."" You're right, but the difference between the two is that Walt quickly realized his mistake and tried to recover the cash. Jesse, on the other hand just laid on the playground apathetically, and made no attempt to get his money back. Another example is when his money got stolen out of his bedroom drawer, and when Mike returned it, he didn't even seem to care. People: Angela and Brock were in no way safe and sound. I mean, christ, Walt poisoned Brock potentially lethally just to get Jesse to do what he wanted. Also, Angela's death was ultimately due to a situation that Jesse would not be it if not for Walt.  Safety: When Gus died, sure it made them safer for a little bit, but Gus was ultimately replaced by a new, but similar tyrant: Walt. It's evident in the last season when Walt essentially threatens to kill Jesse if he doesn't leave town. But the greater threat came with Heisenberg's rise to infamy: Jesse became much more vulnerable, as there were more and more people looking to take him and Walt down.   Walt's guidance is not real guidance. It is manipulation to get him what he wants and make him more money. Jesse and Walt want different things for themselves, so Jesse defying Walt's iron rule is natural. After all, look where Walt's guidance ultimately brought him. Mike said it best to Walt, ""You are a time bomb... Tick tick ticking... And I have no intention to be around for the boom."" Jesse trying to get out from under Walt's thumb was the smartest thing to do, and had he been able to, he probably would have ended up not being imprisoned for several months. Overall, Walt is a manipulative asshole with no sense of morality and Jesse is just a scared kid trying to make it out alive. Had he just followed Walt's guidance without question, there is no doubt in my mind he would've ended up dead."

ThanksObama,1q6b59,motez23,21,Fri Nov 8 16:03:21 2013 UTC,So what happened? How much they get?
ThanksObama,1q6b59,haccubus,45,Fri Nov 8 16:22:44 2013 UTC,"Honestly I'm not sure whatever came up of it.  I was no longer working there when the original lawsuit started.  I got a letter asking if I wanted to get involved.  I responded with yes.  They responded with ""Send us any documents you have which state the hours you worked vs the hours you were clocked in for"".  I had absolutely no documents to send them, so I did nothing.  Never heard anything back.  That was like 2 years ago.  This is the attorney it went through: http://www.girardgibbs.com/family-video-unpaid-overtime-lawsuit/  And it's absolutely true that they were very shitty about their clocking-in/out system.  1) They were on 15-minute increments..  Which meant if you clocked in at say 5:55pm for your 6:00pm shift, you wouldn't start getting paid until 6:00 (5 minute discrepancy)  And they INSISTED you ALWAYS clock in 5 minutes early.  2) And then they made you clock out no more than 7 minutes after your shift schedule.  Which meant your time would get adjusted backwards to the nearest 15-minutes (7 minute discrepancy).    3) So now you clocked out at lets say 12:37am.  You only got paid until 12:30.  And if you still had cleaning to do they would suggest you finish it up as fast as possible.    4) Bank Drops: Worst of all, you had to drop the deposit off at the bank at the end of the night.  The bank we used was probably 4 miles away (in the wrong direction of my house).  And at least 2 employees had to go to verify the drop was made.  This meant you wasted probably another 30 minutes to drop the deposit, and roughly 8 miles of driving which was never paid for.  On any given day I'd say you could easily have worked 40 minutes of time which went unpaid for + mileage.  Luckily I got fired for complaining about this stuff."

My manager encourages us to try to clock in at the exact time our shift starts, but we get paid if we clock in a little early. If we have to run the deposit after our shift, we have to clock out a certain way and we get paid for 15 minutes after our shift. So I guess that lawsuit made some changes for the better."

I didn't like that, so I just stayed clocked in until the manager finished.  They didn't like this, but couldn't do anything about it because I would tell on them, and they just had a 10 thousand dollar fine for making underage kids work past midnight, while clocked out.  At first, the managers were like, ""You know, I can still make you do stuff."" and I went, ""Okay, I'm on the clock, find something for me to do."" They never did."

I'm not against Obamacare, but saying this is as bad as saying that Obamacare is the reason that people have to pay higher premiums."
ThanksObama,1q6b59,Xsunshinex1986,10,Fri Nov 8 20:24:04 2013 UTC,Yeah saying its exactly like Romneycare completely ignores the new insuree rights and the medicaid expansion and exchanges. Pretty much the entire law.
ThanksObama,1q6b59,XanII,1 point,Fri Nov 8 22:06:08 2013 UTC,"It doesn't surprise me much that Taxachussetts would support such a thing, or that Romney would put it into action. The most surprising fact was that he was elected in the first place, since he officially has an R in front if his name. Honestly before he went completely right wing in the last election I think he could've garnered a good amount of votes from the left. He was by far the most levelheaded in the 2008 election IMO."

ThanksObama,1q6b59,CardboardHeatshield,7,Fri Nov 8 16:45:57 2013 UTC,"I know you may have been joking, and this is not the sub for it, but i've been wanting to write this for a few days now. So, fuck it.   It creates a mandated purchase of insurance for all citizens. This can really affect the poorer class who couldn't afford insurance, because now they're required to buy it, but may not be able to pay for it. And even if they get the cheapest plans, their deductibles may be so high that their insurance never kicks in. The poorer you are, the more fucked you are. (EDIT: in fairness, there's a subsidy for people beneath the poverty line, but that doesn't address deductibles) It means that the current insurance companies will be unassailable from here on out. New insurance companies will never be able to compete in the market, and the current ones have a stranglehold on every American.  Due to the repeal of the Glass-Steagall act, monolithic financial corporations can exist again. This means that insurance companies and investment banks can once again be the same entity (see: citigroup). What this means is that all Americans are now legally required to be customers of the largest banking organizations in the world (including major players in the recession, and the LIBOR scandal). It's not just a convenience, now it's a requirement. Because of the above changes, the government is obliged to enter the market in order to provide a lowest common denominator of service, so that insurance companies don't get greedy. Except this means that the government has now made its own market, and required everyone to buy into it.  None of it addresses the problems with the healthcare system. Hospitals still cut different deals with different insurers, medication costs are still high, a single accident can still bankrupt a person, and nothing is cheaper.   tl;dr it is not a healthcare law, it does nothing to repair the healthcare system in the U.S., it doesn't make anything affordable, and it needlessly gives money and power to the banking system"

ThanksObama,1q6b59,timetorevolt,2,Fri Nov 8 17:49:41 2013 UTC,"Sure... There's a lot of people out there who are just awful.  I don't know if that is the norm.  I think that attitude stems from seeing  entitlement programs abused.  For example, I have stood in line longer than normal because the guy in front of me was trying to convince the cashier to give him a cash payout from his ebt card.  This went on for at least 5 minutes.  Things like that probably aren't the norm either (just like conservatives hating poor people probable isn't the norm) however they do instill a disdain for entitlement programs.  Since it's the poor people on these programs, it would appear that conservatives have a general contempt for poor people.    I have more thoughts on the issue but I don't want to waste anyone's time if they're not interested."

ThanksObama,1pww7q,Duhya,-5,Tue Nov 5 15:21:18 2013 UTC,Your right. Other pop musicians have good producers so she is a good musician. Thanks for providing view changing insight that invalidates previous points made.
ThanksObama,1pww7q,ChiefBromden,1 point,Tue Nov 5 16:39:28 2013 UTC,"You were trying to make a contrary point that she didn't have talent, and that everything she has should be credited to her producers. At least, that's what I read out of that, otherwise you'd have elaborated more.     I was trying to make a point that talent as a pop star shouldn't be measured by certain other musical talent (songwriting, vocals, instrument proficiency). That's not what makes a pop-star a good pop-star. For instance, you don't say 'Well, Bob Dylan can't dance for shit so he doesn't have talent'. So, likewise, you can't expect Miley Cyrus to be some visionary songwriter and lyricist. And you don't say ""Well, Elvis never wrote his own music so he sucks!!""      Subjectivity aside (since no one wins that argument), Miley is one of the best pop-musicians in history."
ThanksObama,1pww7q,WeAppreciateYou,2,Tue Nov 5 16:57:57 2013 UTC,"Lets not throw around words like 'best', but she definitely is popular with how much people talk about her online."
ThanksObama,1pww7q,SomethingCleverNC,1 point,Tue Nov 5 17:00:36 2013 UTC,"Like I said. If we take away subjectivity/musical tastes, and agree that pop-stardom is quantifiable via popularity (""pop""), she's one of the best, according to record sales numbers, chart hits, and overall popularity. I'd say one of the most popular pop stars currently and historically. Her 'machine' is certainly one of the best at that."

ThanksObama,1on15p,TallT66,145,Thu Oct 17 12:26:15 2013 UTC,"For those of you who don't know what it is.. over the weekend in Louisiana there was a problem with the EBT system that took the limits off the cards. Normally when you have an EBT card you have a set limit of food and cash a month. You run out you don't eat. So somehow a person found out that the food limits were not on the card and this went viral. Next thing you know Walmart is inundated with people on food stamps because the more rural you get in the south the poorer it is, and the only grocery store is usually the Super Walmart. So people are buying a FUCK TON of stuff and they couldn't do anything about it (which one store did and closed, which is what the others should have done or just not accept EBT). Not just like enough for the week or month, no they bought like 5 fucking cart fulls of shit that you can buy on EBT (which is pretty much every food item but cooked food and alcohol). Someone said it was worse than Black Friday. Once it was sorted out they made an announcement and once people realized they couldn't get all this food for free they just left it."
ThanksObama,1on15p,HSChronic,27,Thu Oct 17 13:50:31 2013 UTC,Illinois too. I work at a Wal Mart here. It was chaos.

ThanksObama,1on15p,Temiller,40,Thu Oct 17 23:00:28 2013 UTC,"Well, a majority of them probably didn't work for the food, so why would they work to put It away?  Before the circle jerk erupts, this is intended for the people who abuse the system and tried to get more food for free. This was not intended towards the people who are just down on their luck, or truly needy and rely on the EBT system."

How can you possibly buy multiple carts full of unhealthy crap and not at any point stop and think to yourself that the money has to come from somewhere. This is the very essence of taking advantage of the system. The people who did this should have their EBT cut off until the money they spent evens out with what they were supposed to get. This is just fucked up.
ThanksObama,1on15p,lolplatypus,2,Fri Oct 18 04:09:07 2013 UTC,"The people who did this should have their EBT cut off until the money they spent evens out with what they were supposed to get.   No, they should be removed from the EBT system and penalized, which is what they usually do in cases of EBT fraud.

ThanksObama,1on15p,ostentatiousox,28,Thu Oct 17 16:55:16 2013 UTC,"http://www.ksla.com/story/23679489/walmart-shelves-in-springhill-mansfield-cleared-in-ebt-glitch  What happened was that there was an outage at one of the Xerox Data Centers that handled the servers for the Electronic Benefit Transfer system that manages the food stamps system in 17 states.  In a Walmart in Louisiana, the glitch made it so the balance of the food cards no longer showed in the cash register. When the Walmart employees called corporate, they were advised to continue processing people. This created a run on foods, with people trying to cram all the things into cards and getting it all for free.   Lynd explained the cards weren't showing limits and they called corporate Walmart, whose spokesman  said to let the people use the cards anyway. From 7 to 9 p.m., people were loading up their carts, but when the cards began showing limits again around 9, one woman was detained because she rang up a bill of $700.00 and only had .49 on her card. She was held by police until corporate Walmart said they wouldn't press charges if she left the food."
ThanksObama,1on15p,Joegotbored,8,Thu Oct 17 13:52:23 2013 UTC,"Maybe you don't know but I am curious. Aren't EBT cards pretty well tracked as far as who owns and uses them?  In cases like this, greedy customers who did manage to take home vast quantities of food, will they be tracked and penalized?"
ThanksObama,1on15p,Teeklin,-3,Thu Oct 17 17:19:21 2013 UTC,"No, they really aren't tracked that well. People often use them to buy things they aren't supposed to and many people don't even need to verify their income to qualify, so you get cases where college students are on food stamps even though they're fully provided for by their parents."
ThanksObama,1on15p,Teeklin,10,Thu Oct 17 17:33:24 2013 UTC,"The cards have a pre-set amount and as long as what they buy qualifies and they stay within that amount, noone is going to bother to track them.  What I mean though is that each card is associated with the SSN of a specific person. If that card was used to buy $700 worth of groceries and only had a balance of $10 then someone is going to notice and the govt should not have a hard time tracking and penalizing the onwer of the card."
ThanksObama,1on15p,geek180,2,Thu Oct 17 17:43:04 2013 UTC,"I'm guessing that because the servers were down there wouldn't be any information about usage during that time to be able to track down the purchases. But then again the store's systems would probably keep track of EBT card numbers as a part of transaction information. So, I guess if Wal-Mart or the government wanted to press charges against the people who took advantage of the error then Wal-Mart could use their financial information to collaborate with the authorities."
ThanksObama,1on15p,Teeklin,3,Thu Oct 17 18:47:20 2013 UTC,Penalizing them how?  What the fuck are you going to do to someone who doesn't have a dollar to their name?
ThanksObama,1on15p,Joegotbored,5,Thu Oct 17 18:46:31 2013 UTC,"Probably make it so they aren't in the black on thier card until the debt has been paid off. For instance, if someone got $700 in groceries and only had five bucks, then they would owe $695. If they got $200 a month usually, that means it would be three months and some change before they would have a positive balance on thier card again."
ThanksObama,1on15p,perspextive,-1,Thu Oct 17 19:22:22 2013 UTC,And all we would have to do is force them and their children to starve for 3 months to get that money back!
ThanksObama,1on15p,lolobean13,12,Thu Oct 17 19:24:24 2013 UTC,Uh well ideally they would eat the $700 in groceries they bought....You're gonna be hard pressed to get me to feel sorry for these people who are exploiting the system. Especially when they have the food.
ThanksObama,1on15p,cranberrykitten,3,Thu Oct 17 19:26:30 2013 UTC,"I agree they should remain indebted to the government for what they did, but realistically I doubt the people that took $700 worth of groceries would be able to store that much food all at once (at least the refrigerated/frozen food, so I'm sure quite a bit of it was left to spoil."
ThanksObama,1on15p,ostentatiousox,10,Thu Oct 17 19:37:18 2013 UTC,"Right, which means they were being selfish and greedy. None of these reasons is making me feel empathy."

I worked 18 hours a week, had 18 credit hours in school, and no kids. I couldn't afford food. I was denied."
ThanksObama,1on15p,stephen89,4,Fri Oct 18 06:09:55 2013 UTC,It's hard to buy things they're not supposed to because you can only buy certain things with it. Every bar code is recognized. Anything they can buy with it is something they're allowed to buy with EBT.

And then it was even nicer to not press charges against someone who was obviously trying to game the system and take advantage of their good will.

ThanksObama,1on15p,GilTheARM,11,Thu Oct 17 13:50:11 2013 UTC,I work at a convenience store in PA and our system was down period so we just told people we couldn't accept EBT which kinda sucked and I felt bad but if I would have had to clean something like that up I would have been PISSED.  That being said I'm tired of people like this giving ALL people on benefits a bad name. I live with my grandparents. They are on EBT. I eat the food but I also try to provide for myself. They don't take advantage of the system like this.

ThanksObama,1on15p,watchout5,29,Thu Oct 17 15:04:02 2013 UTC,"Actually, what most likely will happen, and as someone who uses EBT this is what I hope happens, they will lose their benefits and be billed for the food.  Part of signing up for EBT you are told that if you commit fraud (which this was) you will be subject to paying back everything and lose your benefits."

ThanksObama,1on15p,I_am_Norwegian,14,Thu Oct 17 15:14:51 2013 UTC,"Yes.  100% yes.  Because, if you sum up all the facts - if they took extra, they should then have extra.  So make them pay for it over time!  If they then realize that perishables don't last ten months - they will realize, when they are hungry and have no EBT balance, they probably should NOT have taken that ""accidental advance"" some months back...  It's like saying that if you rob a bank, and get arrested, convicted, and then from your job, fired - you shouldn't go to jail because you need that job to pay your bills.  Screw that.  Start thinking with the front of your brain and realize effects have causes, for a reason."
ThanksObama,1on15p,watchout5,2,Thu Oct 17 17:22:58 2013 UTC,Charged from their ebt.
ThanksObama,1on15p,I_am_Norwegian,-7,Thu Oct 17 15:18:28 2013 UTC,Should their punishment be starvation?    For most of /r/libertarian this wouldn't even be enough. Off with their heads! The peon's think they have a right to eat food!
ThanksObama,1on15p,Warllamaa,6,Thu Oct 17 15:32:58 2013 UTC,Libertarianism is based on the Non-Aggression principle. Do you really think most of them is completely happy with people starving? That's just a strawman what you just wrote. There would be no execution in a libertarian society.
ThanksObama,1on15p,GilTheARM,-3,Thu Oct 17 16:05:39 2013 UTC,"If in that society you force people to work for food and someone comes up short and doesn't work enough for food and as a society you say to them if they ""steal"" said food to survive that there should be punishment you may as well execute said theoretical person because that's what starving them means. Of course it's a strawman, I linked a subreddit ffs."
ThanksObama,1on15p,Lonelan,7,Thu Oct 17 16:09:34 2013 UTC,you force people to work for food    The horror.

ThanksObama,1on15p,tonyvila,6,Thu Oct 17 17:39:30 2013 UTC,"You still get punished for stealing in this society though. What you're assuming is that a libertarian society wouldn't have charities or poor houses or whatever they're called in English, which most societies have had forever."
ThanksObama,1on15p,GilTheARM,1 point,Thu Oct 17 16:36:04 2013 UTC,"Do you mean ""Scrooge: Are there no prisons?  And the union workhouses - are they still in operation?"""
ThanksObama,1on15p,wildtabeast,-1,Thu Oct 17 17:35:46 2013 UTC,"What you're assuming is that a libertarian society wouldn't have charities or poor houses   No no no, my assumption is that charity alone will never meet the needs of people. If the charity was something like, ""Bob gave Bill his old TV"" then we're talking about sustainable charity in a kind of gift economy way. Bob has something he doesn't want anymore, bill gets something he wants. Everyone's happier. With food it's not even close to the story. If someone doesn't get food they might even need medical attention. Do you let them fall ill from not having food or do you find a way beyond begging to get them that food? What if all the charity was gone? I think that's really the crux between many political persuasions. This very issue here. People need food to survive. Wat do? If the answer doesn't involve ""give the people what they need to survive"" then I see no reason to pick on one group or another, that person's just an asshole."
ThanksObama,1on15p,ThoseTwoRobots,3,Thu Oct 17 17:26:17 2013 UTC,"The way I see it, it really comes down to if people care about poor people. Democracy is supposed to be the will of the majority right? And the majority seems pretty bent on forcing people to pay for poor people. Don't you think the same majority would give money to charities? Or do we need to point a gun at someone and force their money into the hands of the government? I have no problems with feeding poor people, I have a problem with the fact that despite the government throwing billion upon billion at the poor people in America, their situation hasn't really improved. It's a shitty system, and they're treating the symptom, not the cause."
ThanksObama,1on15p,Stalked_Like_Corn,0,Thu Oct 17 17:55:15 2013 UTC,"Don't you think the same majority would give money to charities? Or do we need to point a gun at someone and force their money into the hands of the government?   I think robots are infinitely more efficient in both growing and distributing food to people who need it, you also don't have to fight them over ownership and you certainly don't have to use force at least by default, hell they don't even take breaks, you can work them until they can no longer work or they run out of a power source. The idea that any one single person or group would ""own"" enough food in the world to make it such that it's prohibitively expensive to get enough of it to survive is exactly the problem we have with the current system. The idea that you have to ""convince"" a ""majority"" before food can be distributed to the people who need it is exactly everything that's wrong with the market today. We have to ask permission to get access to things that keep us alive? I don't have to ask permission from Joe Bob down the road if it's ok for me to eat today but if I did have to go down to Joe Bob and ask permission just to eat food in my society I would call myself a slave to that society because if you have to ask permission to meet human needs there's no way you're even close to a free human.   It's a shitty system, and they're treating the symptom, not the cause.   It's not a system based on respect. It's a system based on greed. It rewards hording of money, which is the only product in our known universe that can grow, infinitely and forever, for no particular reason at all. The more we reward people with more 0's at the end of their bank account than the people who would make robots that would free humanity from menial tasks like harvesting produce the less freedom our society would have. There's no justifiable reason to give someone a billion dollars if that means someone who doesn't have a billion dollars starves for no other reason than they don't have a single dollar. What is that person with a billion dollars even doing with that cash? Hording it for later. No other system in nature rewards something infinitely without any decay forever. There's nothing about this system that will ever be moral so long as the rules stay the same."

ThanksObama,1on15p,LuigiFebrozzi,2,Thu Oct 17 17:34:18 2013 UTC,"True.  Better analogy, I will give you that.  Ignoring the reasons why the OT records were not looked at, the action of taking extra OT, I think, can be understood to be wrong.  What is the resolution to this then?     A) Fire employee? B) Ask them to pay it back? C) Tell them that they will be placed into an arrears on OT and that future OT will pull from that arrears bucket? D) Do nothing, an punish the boss for not looking at the log?   I would pick C.  With possibly a little bit of D in there; in that maybe the arrears bucket of OT (from choice C) is padded such that only half of all OT submitted for the future is pulled from the arrears so that the employee may still continue to gather OT they may need to live off of.  (Depending on industry.)  Disclosure:  I write software on a team that helps keep running the payroll/finance systems for a large employer.  Sometimes a deduction file may not be picked up from an ancillary system and the employee may not get the deduction in one check.  Making it larger.  The next check contains the missed ded PLUS the deduction for the period itself.  It is understood that this happens, and is rare, but also nothing as large as what the EBT thing was."

ThanksObama,1on15p,ostentatiousox,-8,Thu Oct 17 17:44:25 2013 UTC,"Like I said before, other than the elderly or incapacitated, I don't believe in the government being used for assistance. There are so many charities who do nothing but run food banks and offer personal accounting classes, etc.  For the third time, if you need charity, go to a charity. Don't wreck our walmarts and teach your children that they don't need a father, Uncle Sam's always there.  Speaking of lack of father-figures in poverty stricken areas, any male can be a father, but it takes a Man to be a Dad. If you knock someone up, provide for your damn children, don't make the people who actually work and pay taxes support them."
ThanksObama,1on15p,wildtabeast,6,Thu Oct 17 22:45:51 2013 UTC,"I completely agree that anyone who took advantage of the temporary problems with the EBT cards should face consequences. I think that these people do all of the others who are on assistance a great injustice.  But the fact remains that the majority of people aren't taking advantage of the system. Charities are not nearly enough to provide for everyone who needs help, and it's rarely as simple as ""pulling yourself up by your bootstraps."" I think the government could do more within their social programs to help people eventually transition off of them when possible (like providing resources to help people find decent employment), but eliminating the programs completely would only make a bad problem worse.  As far as men sticking around to care for the children... hell yes! As someone who grew up with a mostly absent father who didn't always pay child support, I couldn't agree more!"
ThanksObama,1on15p,wildtabeast,3,Thu Oct 17 16:49:47 2013 UTC,It's not like the system didn't record which EBT card # was swiped.... it will catch up to them. ;)
ThanksObama,1on15p,oss10,-6,Thu Oct 17 16:51:23 2013 UTC,"We could eliminate & replace the system with something that would work. It probably won't happen, though. If the government really wants to help, they could put people to work like FDR did during the depression & WWII.   But if we tried that now, it's socialism, and socialism is bad.  But the lack of men raising their children, I believe, is one of the main roots of this problem. Numerous children go to live with grandma, who can't work, and she raises the children to believe that food stamp day is like christmas."

ThanksObama,1oia2k,titanium_penis,1 point,Wed Oct 16 03:14:10 2013 UTC,"I will address your comment piece by piece, so I can savor it.   he flat out blamed the Republicans.   That's usually what you do when it's their fault. I would expect congress to point out when something is the president's fault, so we can accurately assess exactly what the real problem is.   It doesn't matter who is at fault   Yes it really does. If someone keeps fucking up and someone else taking the blame, we could blame/ eliminate someone who is trying to help and end up eliminating him instead of attacking the real problem. Taking blame that isn't yours retards a solution from being reached.   he is the PRESIDENT and should take responsibility for things like these and not just blame it on others.   A CEO of a company takes responsibility for shit that goes wrong because he isn't elected. He just wants to appease the public, make them feel at ease because ""the problem will be solved"" and whether or not he apologizes he's still employed. He just might get a little more business out of it. The president taking blame for someone else's actions would have far more severe consequences, and none of the potential benefits.  I can't take you seriously. You just told us that both sides blaming each other makes you upset, but you talk like it's all Obama's fault. Like a group full of grown men and country leaders can't take responsibility for their own actions, so one of those men should step up and take all of the blame so we can't identify anyone who is a problem! Perfect logic Watson, that will keep all the right people in government for sure!"

ThanksObama,1oia2k,Imma_Knight,6,Tue Oct 15 22:41:21 2013 UTC,"it's not ""the republicans"".    the ACA became law, and a relatively small group of people within the legislative branch (yes, with R next to their names) are the ones who decided that we couldn't have a budget agreement without de-funding obamacare, and they set up a showdown, with a time limit of Oct. 1st.    there's a good reason the whole GOP isn't to blame, and that's because most legislators, regardless of party, wouldn't even think to attempt to stop a law that is already law, in a situation that feels really hostage-y.    regardless of what compromises are or aren't being made, the simple fact is that if you want to de-fund obamacare, there are processes in place to make stuff like that happen. the ACA, for example, went through that entire process already.    (some people think that if they make obamacare look horrifying enough, people will agree that the normal process isn't sufficient. based on what i've heard from the truckers in DC, that strategy is already working.)"

ThanksObama,1oia2k,color_of_infinity,1 point,Tue Oct 15 17:19:44 2013 UTC,"curve in recent years makes it more difficult then when JW tested?  I'm skeptical, as for decades, it was clear that SATs were getting easier and  easier (e.g. compare 1960s content to 90s and beyond)"

ThanksObama,1oia2k,bolaxao,15,Wed Oct 16 08:51:50 2013 UTC,"Generally through tests. Though I hate IQs. Theres simply no way to measure all of someones intelligence through an amount of questions, or how someone can apply their minds to new things.  Basically, if you see one of your buddies bragging about their 130 IQ headbutt them in the jaw."
ThanksObama,1oia2k,mfizzled,4,Wed Oct 16 15:02:34 2013 UTC,"Storytime:  I was somewhat disruptive according to one of my first grade teachers (too many poop and fart jokes), and she and the principal decided they wanted me held back a year, despite otherwise doing well. My parents were utterly opposed to this. A psychologist administered an IQ test. Before the test started, he and the principal told me urgently and repeatedly to do each problem three times - to triple-check all my answers and make sure I got everything right before answering.  They didn't tell me there was a time limit factored into the score. I didn't figure out until many years later that they were doing their best to ensure I had a low score. They stopped me after perhaps 20 or 30 minutes. They were not pleased with the results. I scored a 139 and went on to second grade, and my parents had the smug satisfaction of victory over the principal. And he, the psychologist, and my first-grade teacher, Mrs. Solly, can all kiss my little white ass."
ThanksObama,1oia2k,javoss88,7,Wed Oct 16 10:40:33 2013 UTC,"Yeah. Its those kinds of things. I've taken some IQ tests that gave me an 80, which Im pretty sure is like barely above mentally retarded, and some that gave me 145 which im fairly sure is genius level. (Im no genius, but im sure not retarded)"

ThanksObama,1oia2k,Mr_Stillian,3,Wed Oct 16 00:20:11 2013 UTC,"There are several tests with different scales. Throwing around numbers without scale doesn't tell us much. They're all standardized for 100 to be the average, but the scale beyond the overlap matters. A 117 on one scale might be 128 on another. Both are equivalent to each other, but one is inflated and so people like to throw around the inflated number.  That said, if you want an accurate test you'd have to get it professionally administered."

ThanksObama,1nx9fe,Bigpappapunk,1 point,Tue Oct 8 14:40:15 2013 UTC,We adopted gmail at my school during my freshman year in December. We started in September and the old inbox we used filled up twice before we got gmail. Shit was ridiculous.

ThanksObama,1n714w,Holla-back-at-cha,3,Fri Sep 27 16:55:56 2013 UTC,"MINOR SPOILERS BELOW ABOUT GTA 5  Stock Markets and the assassination missions. Save all the assassination missions until after you beat the game.  1st Mission (Hotel one): Buy Betta at 304 BEFORE mission start. After you beat it, Sleep three times, sell at 371.82. 81.5% increase. This mission is required to continue the storyline so chances are that you already did it. So don't worry if you did this one already.  2nd Mission (3 judges one):Buy Debonair beforehand. Sell after it peaks. Buy Redwood immediately after you sell and wait till it peaks at 300%, then sell it  3rd Mission (Bus one): Buy iFruit before the mission and sell at 495.2. Buy Facade and sell when it increases by 50%  4th mission (Prostitute one): Buy Vapid after the mission and sell when it peaks.  5th (I haven't gotten to this one yet so I don't know what you do but it's the one right after the prostitute one): Buy Gold Coast LCN before the mission and sell when it peaks.  Buy Tinkle and go meet the hitchiker on the West Coast Pacific Highway. It's a random event. Sell after you drop him off at the airport.   You should make the maximum $2.147 billion easily.

And you have to press the button when you are playing. Considering how this is a Pinball/Strategy game where you require both hands, it can get awkward very fast."

ThanksObama,1n1thl,phoenixink,3,Wed Sep 25 01:02:18 2013 UTC,"Damn, that sucks! I'm really sorry. Did they compensate you? I've heard that USPS is better than UPS etc. for sending packages because of liability or something..and also the fact that they aren't allowed to go around opening boxes like a private company. hopefully it was completely accidental, but you can't control for the behavior of each employee. The extent of my knowledge is that they use machines to sort envelopes..   sorry about your monitors!"
ThanksObama,1n1thl,Tspyder90,1 point,Wed Sep 25 01:06:18 2013 UTC,"No, the woman on the phone just laughed when I told her about the sword thing. Nothing they can do will ever appease my hatred, but that's life, huh"

ThanksObama,1n1thl,TotallyKyleTotally,6,Tue Sep 24 23:59:42 2013 UTC,I've had this happen to a few of my letters (my friend too) and apparently it goes through an extremely fast sorting system where statistically some of the letters in there will get caught and rip/damage it.

ThanksObama,1n1thl,Yunlokzi,2,Tue Sep 24 23:20:24 2013 UTC,"The local post office is a nightmare where I'm at. Just moved here two weeks ago, there's no mail delivery so every household gets one free PO box. The last tenant never cancelled his, so my very, very chill and kind landlord decided to let me and my boyfriend use his paid PO box (we rent out a part of his vacation home and he only comes up here a couple times a year, so he doesn't really get mail in the first place). We all go in to the post office, show our licenses to the clerk and do our part to make sure it's done properly. So, fast forward about a week and my landlord's gone back to Chicago. We go in to pick up a couple packages and the clerk (different one from the first) goes off on how our names aren't on the PO box and how we must not have done things correctly until we adamantly confirmed that we did in fact do everything we were supposed to. Come to find out, the clerk that ""helped"" us before has done shit like this before; he didn't fill out the necessary paperwork appropriately (he just jotted our information down on some paper somewhere to deal with later) and so our names never got put on the PO box officially. It's a small enough place that the clerks there so far recognize us (there's one I haven't met yet that I've been told numerous times is a complete hag) and so we haven't had too many problem since the first, but I'm always afraid my bills or other important information isn't getting delivered like it should. My parcel pickup papers occasionally have my name written down with a question mark, so I know the problem was never fixed. My mom's been sending me things I couldn't fit in my car for the move, so this PO box fiasco totally pissed me off."

ThanksObama,1m6t4v,therealabefrohman,6,Wed Sep 11 18:39:01 2013 UTC,"Alright so true story: when I was at my high school graduation we were waiting for it to begin in a big room. That part of the building was kind of old brick and some friends and I were sitting on a party of the wall that was inset. When I stood up, though, they noticed I had sat on some white gum, which contrasted nicely with our black gowns. We went to the bathroom and tried to scrub it off to no avail. I figured it was a lost cause and I was being punished for my career of academic negligence one final time. Right before we were about to go out to our seats, I noticed some black electrical tape on the floor. It was dirty, and people had been stepping on it...but it was black. So I peeled it off and stuck it over the gum, which actually worked pretty well to cover it up.   On that day...On that day, nobody had to know my plight."

ThanksObama,1m5gtj,phuzzz,16,Wed Sep 11 04:25:58 2013 UTC,I initially thought these girls were being satirical because they didn't like the actual show. Then I realized they're just incorrectly using the word literally.
ThanksObama,1m5gtj,dudeitsmason,13,Wed Sep 11 05:48:27 2013 UTC,"Nope, Oxford has added ""figuratively"" as a second definition for literally so they are correctly using it. The English language doesn't mean shit anymore..."

ThanksObama,1m5gtj,bouchard,0,Wed Sep 11 13:09:51 2013 UTC,"Yes, but adding the antonym as an additional definition of a word is a ridiculous way for it to evolve. It's like if we said 'up"" could also mean ""down"" now.  Or that that's wrong but wrong means right now so that's actually right.  We didn't change the definition of ""bad"" to ""good"" when it became slang, I don't see why we should make literally mean literally whatever we want."

Do they threaten to shoot anyone looking out an open window?  What if your window has no curtains?  They can't possibly shoot you just because you opened it.  Or is it so you can't see / photograph the snipers?  Like maybe this window looks out over a roof where they are stationed?

Edit: While we're at it check out a girl who DID make the team she didn't get to do anything but vault iirc, but without exaggerating, she was the best vaulter in the world hands down. Nobody else can do what she does in this video. Unfortunately she fell down during the vault competition and got silver, and you may remember her snarky pissed at herself face going viral that summer."

Mistakes happen, things go wrong with the grips, and so on.  McKayla Maroney, who did what is arguably a PERFECT vault, has a habit of butchering one of the passes on her floor routine, because it's long and she runs out of room.  Shit happens man.

ThanksObama,1lhu4i,well_here_I_am,3,Sun Sep 1 09:56:20 2013 UTC,Apparently Obama phones are actually Reagan phones.
ThanksObama,1lhu4i,bouchard,2,Sun Sep 1 02:52:40 2013 UTC,"Program started under Reagan, true, but really abused recently.  I heard something on the radio the other day about an investigative author that decided to see what it would take to get an Obamaphone.  Apparently nothing. She was totally honest about how much money she made and they just gave her one.  And then another....and another."
ThanksObama,1lhu4i,jakielim,2,Sun Sep 1 14:58:38 2013 UTC,"I don't know what radio program that was, but the ""investigative author"" was lying or duped.   The Lifeline program only covers monthly discounts on landline or wireless telephone service for eligible consumers.  It does not pay  cellular companies to provide free cell phones to consumers, although some cellular service providers choose to offer that benefit to their Lifeline customers.   So the program doesn't even include a phone unless the service provider opts to provide one as an additional benefit.   Lifeline discounts are not available only to ""welfare recipients"" —  these programs are implemented at both the state and federal levels, so qualification criteria can vary from state to state, but in general participants must have an income that is at or below 135% of the federal Poverty Guidelines, or take part in at least one of the following federal assistance programs:...   So she easily could have gone to multiple companies and/or through multiple programs. Depending on her situation, she could very easily be below the poverty line.  Most importantly:   A number of web sites touting Lifeline benefits and imitating the look of government web sites have sprung up on the Internet, but those sites are privately operated ones created to promote the sales of cellular services and have no official connection to the federal government or the current presidential administration:   By 2010, Virgin Mobile, Verizon, Sprint, i-Wireless, Head Start, Consumer Cellular, Midwestern Telecom, Allied Wireless, and others had free phone plans. That's why you can find all these ""free cell phone"" websites that look kind of shady, like Obamaphone.net or FreeGovernmentCellPhones.net. In 2011, the FCC said that these carriers were ""fiercely competing for the business of low-income consumers by marketing ‘free’ phones."" TracFone spokesman Jose Fuentes [said], ""We’ve had a lot of fly-by-night companies come in."" Fuentes estimated that more than 1,700 wireless companies were part of Lifeline. Between 2008 and 2012, the number of people with Lifeline phones grew from 7.1 million to 12.5 million. These companies may be fly-by-night at providing cell phone service, but they are pretty good at marketing, and as the rush of merchandise tied to his inauguration showed, Obama's name seems to move product.    So it's possible that she wasn't even getting these phones through a government program.  Also note that these service subsidies aren't even paid for by taxpayer dollars.  You really should start being more credulous of what you hear from Alex Jones."

They pay no income taxes, they get access to all sort of Government programs. Don't be shocked when  you see a panhandler in a good location, walk over to a parked sports car and get in and drive off. Also don't be shocked to see two people fighting over a spot as they can be worth A LOT of money.  If you really want to help some one down on their luck, and still trying to do the right thing and work and honest job then tip the people whom preform services for you. Despite what you might think those people that make your food, change your oil, ring up your groceries make totaly shit pay! Those are the some of the people that deserve some help and a hand up.

ThanksObama,1kqlyq,borbit,1 point,Fri Sep 6 11:41:33 2013 UTC,"I'll try to describe the ones I've had as well as I can. I haven't played much recently so you may have already fixed them.  The first involved numbers not corresponding correctly. For example, a square on the grid could say there's four mines near it, when there isn't. I have no idea how to recreate the bug, but it seems to happen occasionally when hitting the edge of an area someone else cleared previously. It's as if there is a disjoint between two sections of the grid where the data saved differently (or maybe corrupted somehow).  The second one I had, back when I played it a lot more, involved the website freezing when I moved from the daily second place position to the daily first place. When this bug occurred, clicking the next square on the grid would cause it to load forever but never reveal the square. To fix it, I had to reload the webpage. This bug only occurred when the score pane on the bottom of the page was on the daily score (the yellow one), and did NOT occur if I switched it to lifetime scores (the green one).  If it helps any, I use Google Chrome, and I did not test either of these bugs in any other browsers. I also haven't played much recently so you may know about these bugs. Both errors I had were rare, for the most part Minefield runs great. Thanks for asking, it's cool that you check when people have any issues with the game."

So your 6 months becomes 18 months, and the idea is most people generally misplace or damage their reusable bags before they've gotten that much use out of them.  And I completely agree on the waste issue--the study was only on the energy cost to make them in the first place.  EDIT:  sources  According to this and this it's 171 times to offset the greenhouse gas emission of the reusable bag.  Guess I forgot a digit...

I'm not saying that what happened on 9/11 wasn't serious, but the National EAS is most likely reserved for things like imminent nuclear threat, imminent threat of invasion, a natural super-disaster, etc. Here is a quote from the wikipedia page:   Richard Rudman, then chairman of the EAS National Advisory Committee explained that near immediate coverage in the national media meant that the media itself provided the warning or alert of what had happened and what might happen as quickly as the information could be distributed. ""Some events really do serve as their own alerts and warnings. With the immediate live media coverage, the need for an EAS warning was lessened."" 34 PEP stations were kept on high alert for use if the President had decided to order an Emergency Action Notification. ""PEP is really a last-ditch effort to get a message out if the president cannot get to the media."

ThanksObama,1k4fzr,chewp911,5,Sun Aug 11 15:21:40 2013 UTC,"Which is stupid for two reasons. 1. While America doesn't currently have its own manned rocket program, it still has a pretty sizable astronaut corps that simply hitches rides on Russian spacecraft. 2. Obama doesn't set NASA's budget, congress does, so even if Obama wanted nothing more in the universe than to start sending astronauts into space in our own rockets, it wouldn't mean anything unless congress can be convinced to allocate the massive amounts of funding to NASA that would be required."

ThanksObama,1k4fzr,KingQuagaar,4,Sun Aug 11 19:24:49 2013 UTC,The idea of this subreddit is that it's supposed to be a place that's free from anything actually pertaining to politics. This is why almost all of the posts are things like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup with chocolate stuck to the wrapper. Rule 2 exists to prevent this sub from quickly degrading into an anti-Obama circlejerk like much of the rest or reddit has after the PRISM scandal.

ThanksObama,1jols5,TimmyWithaG,7,Sun Aug 4 17:23:26 2013 UTC,"After moving a pile of yard debris to the curb using our hard-earned blue tarp, there was a bit of a wager.  There were two possibilities:   The tarp will be left behind, because it is obviously a container for trash and the ""garbage can precedent"" applies. The tarp will be removed, like anything on the curb that isn't a garbage can.   The tarp was indeed gone (and I won the bet), but the possibility that the tarp blew away or was stolen meant that we needed additional verification.  Suffice to say, nobody expected such violent precision.  (Why is there a camera?  It's the DogShitCam; city dwellers with front yards will understand my motivation.  Why was ""Thanks, Obama"" the first thing that came to mind?  Because TARP, that's why.)"

ThanksObama,1jjmrg,WiWiWiWiWiWi,6,Fri Aug 2 06:59:32 2013 UTC,Why not file and pay electronically?  It seems silly to complain when other options are available.
ThanksObama,1jjmrg,hahagato,1 point,Fri Aug 2 16:07:33 2013 UTC,It's like $20 or $30 extra to file state taxes. I'm not gonna pay that on top of paying them when I can just print it and mail it instead.

ThanksObama,1jjmrg,joebacca121,24,Fri Aug 2 07:19:58 2013 UTC,It's actually better to not get a large tax refund. That is money you could have been using to invest that the government gets to use interest free.
ThanksObama,1jjmrg,Dial_M_for_Monkey,17,Fri Aug 2 07:14:03 2013 UTC,Exactly.  You technically win.  Big tax returns = the interest free loans you give the government.  Getting this is actually a win.

ThanksObama,1jjmrg,hoopycat,1 point,Fri Aug 2 19:20:45 2013 UTC,Very interesting... I'll have to look into that.  The way I currently have my withholding is that I'll owe federal taxes that are nearly equal to what I always get refunded by the state.
ThanksObama,1jjmrg,Alaenvy,1 point,Fri Aug 2 21:20:34 2013 UTC,"Grab a W4 and fix both problems.  :-)  I tend to be picky about this, in part, because I live in a state where refunds are normally quite slow.

If you want, you can get a huge return every year.  It's not the returns you should be comparing, but the total amount paid.  Odd are, you and your coworkers are paying the same amount, they are just withholding too much.  Either that or they have deductions you don't have, such as kids or a house -- things the government can't change for you."

If you have any evidence to suggest otherwise, I'd be happy to listen, but until then, simply saying, condescendingly, that ""You can't be daft enough to possibly believe that"", really isn't much of an argument."
ThanksObama,1isso1,hail_termite_queen,-3,Tue Jul 23 04:09:44 2013 UTC,"The war in Afghanistan was about Osama. Billions of dollars were spent on it. That fact, coupled with they hadnt actually caught him was why Bush began to play down the need to get him. An election was coming up and they were trying to deflect criticism about the subject. The might of America had been stymied by cave dwellers. It had become quite embarassing for the administration. They may well have dialed back the troop force and money, but there is zero chance the CIA And other intelligence groups completely stopped the search."
