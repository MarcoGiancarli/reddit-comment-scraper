Atheros cards have open-source drivers (unlike a lot of Broadcom) and (up through 802.11n) don't require binary firmware (unlike Intel).

LinuxActionShow,3e14or,kyoei,8,Wed Jul 22 01:27:56 2015 UTC,"Firstly, per-game optimizations and shader replacement have been done for years now. This is done under windows and also done by nvidia. This isn't some kind of shady business that you suggest. I noticed how you Linux evangelists didn't even mention the current state of AMD FOSS drivers vs a virtually non-existent Nvidia counterpart. The FOSS driver is very stable, works on newer kernels, has video decode and power management support. Noah maybe you should try that instead of the catalyst driver.  Not directly related to linux but amd has designed the apus inside all current game consoles. As for the pc market, they have been in decline and are slowly being pushed out due to intel's contra revenue and aggressive pricing on their baytrail based atoms, celerons and pentiums in notebooks, tablets and sff desktops.  Don't go into such a topic with a lack of knowledge and pretend to know what you guys are talking about. Maybe do some cursory research.  TL:DR AMD APUs are great for linux and it helps if you actually know what you are talking about. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL0aAmYuSa8"
LinuxActionShow,3e14or,APUsilicon,8,Tue Jul 21 12:16:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I was actually surprised at this.  AMD don't deserve to get this crap all the time. They are actually funding open source drivers, which Nvidia do not. If you want performance AND completely open drivers, AMD is the only choice.  Also, these game specific driver optimisations are not even done in secret. Catalyst probably has optimisations for Half-Life 2 that obviously works well for CS:GO too, since they run on the same engine. Pure coincidence, that maybe AMD have simply missed.  AMD don't want to do these dirty optimisations in the drivers, they cost money and time. Nvidia love doing them, so they are always on top of game devs helping them getting them in. AMD instead want to develop new APIs that allow the game devs to make their games run without the driver doing most of the work. That's why they made Mantle (that then turned into Vulkan. Yes, Vulkan/""OpenGL-Next"" is purely thanks to AMD)  Graphics drivers are more like virtual environments these days than actual drivers. Mantle/Vulkan/DirectX12 will make the drivers dumb, and give developers the powers to do optimisations directly in the game engines instead of the drivers. This model is clearly superior. This is the model that AMD is trying to make a reality, but sure Nvidia is ""the best for Linux gaming"".  EDIT: Disclaimer, I do use an Nvidia GTX 670 right now, because yes, AMD Catalyst did not work well for me, since they focus on Ubuntu, and Arch's rolling model doesn't mix well with it. But I will buy an AMD card to support them as soon as the new AMDGPU driver (will land in Linux 4.2) arrives."

A couple of points that were inaccurate in the show too:   Per game optimizations are basically the industry standard ever since I can remember and it is super common on windows that updating drivers gives similar performance boosts for new games. They are not called ATI. ATI was bought out by AMD years ago.   As for why I prefer AMD for both CPU and GPU...  Intel is a terrible company. Their illegal business practices in the 2000s are why the CPU industry is in the place it is and they price gouge as much as they can get away with. They also still intentionally gimp AMD processors for programs that are compiled with the Intel compiler which still affects numerous popular Windows programs and games. I hope ARM succeeds solely so that Intel is no longer relevant.  Nvidia isn't as bad, but they are still terrible about open source. Their whole strategy is to make exclusive APIs and features so that people are locked into their tech. See Cuda, PhysX etc. They also have intentionally gimped GTX 9xx gpus under the open source driver after promising they would give nouveau firmware blobs(which they never did).   Meanwhile AMD has dedicated themselves to open source and even though they are the underdog, they are still inventing new tech and open sourcing it, no strings attached. Vulkan can be directly attributed to AMD being a good open source vendor.  P.S. sorry for any typos, formatting and terseness. Posting from my phone."

LinuxActionShow,3e1ea3,Tireseas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:43:51 2015 UTC,"The title does not mention the only applicable scenario involves distribution. You can distribute container files pulling in the image, and allow for local image copies. No harm done.  Then. All non-public distribution or personal use is out of scope, as is GPL'ed software that Ubuntu builds upon. So even if you alter the Ubuntu binary image, and distribute the result within a company for all users, you're fine.  Tree. ""Ubuntu-based"" is very dubious. If I recompile and rebrand all stuff to be compliant to the license because I don't want to ask permission to Canonical, my container is still Ubuntu based.   These small glitches are just FUD making it sound as if you cannot use Ubuntu at all due to it's licensing, which is simply untrue.  Other than that (but moving away from this post), I really don't get the problem. You're fine if you recompile without the trademarks, and what is the issue with that? Especially taking into account the small footprint of a container image, even smaller taking into account only the non-GPL stuff (if any) this is not an unacceptable requirement. FOSS has always been about open source, but now all of a sudden compiling is a big issue.  Now some real world scenarios.  Intel ships the 2GB/32GB compute stick with Windows. The wireless driver for Linux is unreliable or proprietary. This policy prevents Intel from taking Ubuntu, include the crappy driver, and say ""we ship Ubuntu"". Therefore, users that would buy it will not get the reaction ""Ubuntu sucks, even the wireless does not work"" when using this device.  Equally, some smart entrepreneur cannot kickstart-fund a tablet, putting some random stuff together, and call it an ""Ubuntu tablet"". He can however take the code, remove Ubuntu branding, rebrand and recompile it.   This stuff is real world, and protects the average consumer. What is the issue? Remember, a license has to cover all ground.  Kubuntu on the other hand, benefits a lot from the Ubuntu branding. So Canonical wants to know what is being shipped is actually what got compiled on their build servers. If not, Kubuntu can go Elementary or Mint and rebuild the distro. This is not unreasonable at all imho. Again, a lot of noise about what? Perhaps Elementary or Mint don't comply 100% today, but I honestly think they can be asked to do so.  The same goes for containers. Netflix can build a docker container image to connect to their services, but unless they make an agreement with Canonical, they have to rebrand it. The day that suspicious government X start distributing fishy containers Y for mass espionage on you, you might actually be happy about this. Again, not that far fetched at all.  How hard is it to understand that enabling any party in the world to ship binary software using somebody else's name, is a very, very bad idea?  On a personal note: let's stop the hypocrisy. Try and ask a Manjaro question in an Arch forum, or an Ubuntu one in a Debian forum, and see for yourself how open minded the community really is about shipping someone else's stuff. Let's not be all shocked now that someone actually wants to prevent these kind of ""misunderstandings"" from happening. The FOSS world does not end by this and the stuff that really matters (the code) is still out there for us to use.   BTW: I would not be surprised that other distributions have either the same stuff in their policies, or will start doing so now that they realize the potential danger.  BTW 2: Can you repackage RHEL freely? Or Suse? Take a bet?"

Well, maybe you should indeed actually ask Valve before using this argument for any license related claim you want to make. Furthermore, the Gabe comment was before the new license version was released.  Facts is, Valve uses Ubuntu trademarking on their website, stipulates it to be their favorite Linux version, and the only Linux client they ship themselves is for Ubuntu. Especially the 2nd element does not add up.   They're using copyright law, not trademark law so they don't just impose trademark rights. After all trademark rights have nothing to do with the GPL, which would be unrelated, and them requiring to rebuild every non-copyleft package. So it's not a matter of branding...   If a project thinks it is important to have copyleft, they should license stipulating copyleft. That's the whole point of it.   Yeah, the problem with government spy agencies is that they violate marketing trademarks....   If this gives them mass adoption, it sure is part of it."

X2Go does not use regular X11 over SSH forwarding, it uses nx-libs over SSH. nx-libs greatly improves X11 performance over WANs (by compressing and caching the X11 traffic, and eliminating the X11 round-trips.) It also makes it possible to suspend (disconnect) and resume sessions (which Noah did at 50:18). We are developing nx-libs btw."

LinuxActionShow,3dwa6j,ChrisLAS,2,Mon Jul 20 14:00:32 2015 UTC,Cool.. I am wondering though when Wayland final lands will it make it easier and more secure way of running remote desktops or will it just be a nightmare to port the existing code to the new methods. I know there is some moves to getting a RDP compositor back in 2013  but will that be any help at all?
LinuxActionShow,3dwa6j,veritanuda,2,Mon Jul 20 14:47:03 2015 UTC,"The fact  that in Wayland the window manager / compositor is also the display server (by linking to libwayland) opens up possibilities for remote desktop solutions in general on Linux. For example, locking the local screen when the user connects remotely to an existing local session, similar to how Microsoft RDC works.  However, nx-libs (and thus X2Go) will not be part of Wayland. nx-libs basically works with the existing X11 protocol rather than replacing it. Standard X11 clients (like your window manager and your X11 apps) run on the X2Go server, and a standard X Server runs on the X2Go Client (we even bundle the VcXsrv X Server for Windows clients.) nx-libs is the middleman with its own protocol going over the SSH connection.  However, even once Wayland becomes common, many desktop environments will continue to support X11. So they will continue to work with X2Go, and other remote desktop solutions based on nx-libs.  EDIT: Also, AFAIK, we are still waiting for David Fort (Hardening Consulting) to publish his RDP Wayland Compositor and his new 2014-2015 version of FreeRDS (X11 RDP Server) as open source."

LinuxActionShow,3dwa6j,veritanuda,2,Tue Jul 21 08:11:23 2015 UTC,"For a long long long time I've been using X11 over SSH from home to work and vice versa. Before enabling compression in SSH it was excruciating to use.  There's an option, for those that don't know, that allows (via the ~/.ssh/config file) to turn compression on and to set the compression level and tech.  I remember experiencing excruciatingly slow performance turn acceptable [with that turned on]. I'd never investigated x2go until this episode.  I tested it yesterday after the show.  I found that I am very pleased with the performance when setting it to launch, say, an individual application such as the browser.  This gave me extremely good performance (though playing a Youtube video just doesn't cut it).  Maybe there's an option for improving that performance.  My experience wasn't all great.  When I first started it I left it at defaults where it was set to run KDE remotely.  That resulted in a black screen and no desktop.  I still haven't overcome that issue.  In the run box I did attempt tell it to run via startkde, however, I don't believe that is valid any longer for plasma 5.  Does anyone know the proper command to run the plasma 5 desktop or whether it works?  On the topic of flash.  I don't see how Flash will be discontinued any time soon.  It is a product that is still heavily used.  Hell, even Jupiterbroadcasting.com uses it everywhere.  The end of life will come when it is no longer used.  Whatever happens there will always be a vector for attack in technologies that are used everywhere.  If it isn't in flash then they'll target the Google Chrome or Firefox browser itself, or something else.  What we'll be given is an unknown to replace a known.  This isn't to say that that isn't happening already.  I'm sure it is, but the attacks will be bigger and more often.  As for the show on Sunday where Chris stated he had noticed a marked drop off in the chat room.  I don't go into the chat room any longer though I watch the live show, unless the antics get too unprofessional.  In that case, I just wait to download the episode.  There are factors that have to be considered.  The show, as of late, has been starting later and later (yes, this week it was on time).  Chris has been expressing his disdain for things more and more frequently, and I don't agree with most of what he says when he goes off on them.  Both hosts have shown a bit of bias (yeah, I know Noah believes that it is part of life, however, it can be controlled -- you can keep your bias in check for the episodes and let it out for your friends).  And, it is summer, computer and Internet use drops off while people enjoy the fun outdoors.  Finally, I think, it's that you guys have done a few shows where you record them the week before so people are beginning to think that this will be a habit.  Yes, you have announced them.  I came in one Sunday to watch only to wait for quite a while before exiting and only later found that you had recorded the show at a different time earlier in the week. Why the recorded episode wasn't run at its' normal time sort of made me wonder."
LinuxActionShow,3dwa6j,jdblaich,3,Mon Jul 20 18:56:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, SSH supports lossless zlib compression. But X2Go supports lossy JPEG compression and other compression methods too. It's in the Client Session settings. The caching + eliminating the X11 round trips are also important for performance. KDE4 is compatible, but KDE5 is not. We intend to make KDE5 compatible with the release of nx-libs 3.7.0. There are some general performance improvements we are considering for nx-libs 3.6 & 3.7 that will improve video playback performance. You can also lower the JPEG quality settings in X2Go Client. The Arctica Project is a spin-off of X2Go, and has a prototype for extremely smooth video playback by forwarding the video without re-compression. It's called Telekinesis."
LinuxActionShow,3dwa6j,mikedep333,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:40:28 2015 UTC,"I know this isn't a place to post bug reports.  Here goes anyway.    When you create a session icon on the desktop you create one  without a space between the executable and the --session.  e.g., /usr/bin/x2goclient --sessionid=1234567890123  It creates it without the space before the --sessionid= This makes launching the session generate an error from the desktop manager saying that it can't find program.  KDEInit could not launch '/usr/bin/x2goclient--sessionid=1234567890123'  Btw, I put the /usr/bin in front of the executable."
LinuxActionShow,3dwa6j,jdblaich,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:43:33 2015 UTC,I settled on ssh forwarding and a vncserver session for most things. Works ok. But not seamless and clipboard often fails to work as intended.  I like x2go and if I ever need  to run a full desktop remotely I use it.
LinuxActionShow,3dwa6j,veritanuda,2,Mon Jul 20 22:44:44 2015 UTC,"You can run an app without running the desktop.  I'd tried X11 through SSH with Firefox only to have it fail.  I successfully got it to work with Google Chrome.  It was slow.  With compression on it ran much better.  Just letting x2go run my Internet browser, which it seems to have associated with Firefox, Firefox ran like a champ only slightly lagging albeit with poor video playback.  From the reply above, the dev said they are working on that.  From his video demo it seems to run exceptionally well."
LinuxActionShow,3dwa6j,jdblaich,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:22:41 2015 UTC,"Lots of apps nowadays require various environment variables to be set, processes (like d-bus) to be running, etc. Therefore, some apps like virt-manager work under a desktop session (like MATE) but not under a single app (or published apps) session. Firefox works great with X2Go though in single app mode. See this link for a production use case of Firefox on Debian Wheezy. We are working to address the remaining application compatiblity issues in single application mode (as well as published applications mode), but we really want to engage FreeDesktop.org about updating their autostart standard for single applications. Perhaps the ""desktop environment"" string ""SingleApp"" should be defined in the update. Firefox was detected according to the simple logic for the ""WWWBROWSER"" session in the bash script /usr/bin/x2goruncommand. We are thinking of making session overrides configurable via files under /etc/. For example, if /etc/x2go/overrides.d/WWWBROWSER exists and is an executable file, then we would execute it instead of following the browser detection logic in x2goruncommand. (And presumably you would make the file a bash script that calls your favorite browser.) The actual path/syntax may change by the time someone implements this feature and gets it merged."
LinuxActionShow,3dwa6j,mikedep333,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:54:51 2015 UTC,"Oh I did not say it would not work on that way, like I say x2go is very good and I would recommend it for people who want full desktop experience. But  for server admin I mostly use vncserver and ssh forwarding so on the server:  vncserver -geometry <widthxheight>  then you can login remotely with:  ssh -p<port> -L<lport<:localhost:<vncport> user@host  and then use vncclient to connect to it:  xvnc4viewer localhost:<lport>  For things like control panels and web configurations without opening up ports to the internet  it is fine with the added advantage of it being persistent.   Again I am not streaming video and audio though the connection but it also works on some very low bandwidths. Very handy for me when I am doing maintenance on the move with a phone or a tablet."

I have found that if I look hard enough, all the software I need is there and can be brought up to date, but running tumbleweed, each zypper dup  will change the repo depending on the most recent package, ultimately landing in dependency hell.  Tl;dr  tumbleweed is great if you stick to vanilla packages and repos, otherwise arch + aur  (or maybe Debian sid) is better."
LinuxActionShow,3dr0pz,rbrownsuse,4,Sat Jul 18 18:19:57 2015 UTC,"zypper dup with lots of additional repos is bad, yes, which is why the advice is do not do zypper dup if you have additional repos  zypper dup is designed to do distribution upgrades (one regular release version to another). In order to do this a number of key safety features are disabled, like ensuring it only upgrades packages from the repo/vendor you already installed them from.  zypper up is the safer option for upgrading your Tumbleweed machine when you have other repos present  Alternatively, the latest version of zypper that just landed in Tumbleweed had some new parameters to let you control zypper dup's removal of safety features so you can use zypper dup without it being quite so much like Russian roulette  --[no-]allow-downgrade  --[no-]allow-name-change  --[no-]allow-arch-change  --[no-]allow-vendor-change"

LinuxActionShow,3dr0pz,deathtoferenginar,2,Mon Jul 20 09:06:07 2015 UTC,"My sole complaint with Tumbleweed - as far as I'm aware, you can't run TW and retain your KDE4 installation.    Damned annoying, since I'd love to have things a little more up-to-date, and I'm happy as a clam sticking with KDE, but the newest version of it just doesn't work for my needs yet at its present stage of development.  Also, the SOB had a crash problem upon clean install that forkbombed my system with crash dialogs to the point of hanging it up, last time I dived in.  Bad enough that I couldn't effectively try to diagnose and fix it.  Aside from KDE not liking me, my machine, or stuff I do - everything else was seamless, rapid, and worked just as comfortably as 13.2 does right now."
LinuxActionShow,3dr0pz,deathtoferenginar,3,Sat Jul 18 23:51:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's true you can't use KDE4 with it, but I think that's true of most rolling releases out there. Personally I like Plasma 5 so much better than KDE4 that I never really thought about it."

I wish, however irrationally, that they'd mirrored the KDE4 stuff and/or left an option to upgrade everything else.  There's probably some way to do it but I can't imagine it's easy for your armchair enthusiast.  Just sucks that unless you jump ship to another DE like Gnome, you can expect to have a degraded experience, even if the older version will run fine under later snapshots than 13.2.    Killed any chance of TW enthusiasm and adoption for me for that one, stupid reason."
LinuxActionShow,3dr0pz,deathtoferenginar,4,Sun Jul 19 02:35:49 2015 UTC,"The team took a very long, hard, but ultimately pragmatic approach to the upgrade from KDE 4 to Plasma 5  To sum up months of discussions in a nutshell it boiled down to 3 things   Packaging both KDE4 and Plasma 5 alongside each other so they can both work on the same Distribution is painfully hard Having unsupported/unmaintained software in Tumbleweed is considered antithetical with the concept of a rolling release, and KDE 4 Applications's last bugfix release was 14.12.3 in March, KDE SC 4's last release was 4.14.3 in November 2014 the openSUSE KDE team only wanted to move to Plasma 5 when they thought it was ready for daily use, which they had been conservative over, given they had all been using it for their own daily use for some months before pushing Tumbleweed over   Considering the first point, the extra work required seemed especially egregious when you factor in the second point. Ultimately, the openSUSE KDE team had to make a judgement call based on the realities set by KDE upstream, and I think they made the right choice on balance."
LinuxActionShow,3dr0pz,rbrownsuse,2,Sun Jul 19 16:42:09 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, Glorious Lizard Overlord.    To your first point - I agree, if what you mean is trying to install them both simultaneously.  No way that can happen.  Your second - looks like all the KDE4 packages are in the TW repo.  So does that mean I'm right in that, somehow, I can switch over to TW and just run KDE4 if I can get it to hold back the KDE5 upgrades in YaST?  Or did I fail to put all of my brain back in my head when it fell out researching this yesterday? :)  Yeah, I see the reasoning and in large part I agree with it - I'd have held off until more things were ported and polished for Maximum Rice Factor, but it doesn't mean the thing's broken.  It was a rough cowpath at first release, though - both in packaging snafus and the resultant DE.  Appreciate ya chiming in, Richard.  :)"

LinuxActionShow,3dr0pz,Tireseas,2,Sun Jul 19 11:19:25 2015 UTC,"First impression is a fair title.   After months on Tumbleweed I tried again Arch (I ditched it for oS) and I found it unfamiliar, all the basics things needing me to set them up, the AUR with multiple versions of the same things and no automatic updates.  IMO Tumbleweed differs from Arch because it brings an out of the box system and GUI administration tools - these are perks or defects depending on one's use case. TBH on Tumbleweed there are some rough edges, however I got used to work around them.   IMHO about show hosts usage everything capable to run a browser, a media player and an editor (markdown or whatever) is good for the job, if there's a VM app it is a plus. For the production ""appliances"" it is another story: stabilty and specific updates of a limited number of packages are mandatory, then neither Arch nor Tumbleweed."

So I just quit my job working for a small TV station where I was responsible for – among many other things – translating/subtitling two monthly TV programs. When I started working there, there was nothing set up for this type of work. Up until my arrival they were outsourcing the subtitles and an additional translator was proofing and manually entering each subtitle at the exact location the subtitle-company indicated. This puts “small” in “small TV station” on a whole other level ;)  Anyways, so when I started working there, things needed to change. During my first two weeks, I was researching solutions and when I found some time to properly test aegisub, I found the type of software that helped me and my work colleagues to reduce our work time considerably (bare in mind, at the beginning of this Job I had no prior experience working for TV etc.). So once I figured out how to work with the software, I set up the rest of the work flow for what became a new kind of job, trained my colleagues to work with aegisub, and it was smooth sailing from then on. The best thing, this software is really powerful (we didn't need most of the features it has to offer), opensource and cross-platform (which meant my colleagues could use their Windows machines whereas I stayed most of the time on Linux)."

I'm also on Arch, and because I don't need Hal for anything else this lightweight extension is a better option for me than installing either the full Hal package, or even just the stub. All the extension does is allow easy switching of the user-agent string - which is all that's required. That allows access to the DRM-free stream, so no Hal required.  Netflix doesn't use Flash (but annoyingly is only supported in Chrome / Chromium, not Firefox), and I stream BBC iPlayer through MPV without any issues. I've only just got Prime (enjoying the new Extant!), so that was the only one I needed to sort.

RHEL ate into their market a lot which is pushing them out of the midrange and into people with higher performance requirements.

That's wrong, totally wrong. Our contributor numbers have been ascending at a pretty comfortable rate in both the project as a whole and in key technical areas - for example our contributor numbers for Tumbleweed (and its precursor, Factory) have quadrupled over the last 4 years at a pretty much constant smooth rate.  The 'problem' (I don't actually think of it as a problem, just more of a fact of life) is that the openSUSE Project  is more than just that one distro we ship every 12 months  Tumbleweed, Evergreen, OBS, openQA, snapper, kiwi, etc etc we're a project with many 'products', with the openSUSE regular release being just one of them.  And when one of those products is arguably the best rolling distro available (Tumbleweed doesn't just roll, it rocks), and many of those others are tools which help you build and make the most out of that best rolling distro available, its kind of understandable that developer interest in the 'traditional' openSUSE distro has waned.  Why work on something you already have had running for 6 months? Marketing and such for the regular distro is also a bit of a challenge with the old model ""Hey everyone, come use our new openSUSE release, which is just like the Tumbleweed releases we do every week, just you know, without anything cool in it for 12 months""  Leap is a chance to tackle all that while giving something awesome to our users. By using SLE sources, we have less work to do because all the 'base system' stuff is already built, tested and maintained by SUSEs SLE engineers who are doing that work anyway. Our contributors can then focus on just the bits that excite them, Plasma 5, new GNOME, the 'userspace stuff' that excites them and our users. We're hoping to also attract new contributors who are excited by this new model of an enterprisy-community hybrid. And then we end up with something exciting, different to bring to the world with each release, different from what everyone else is doing, and distinct from Tumbleweed and with a more refined use case than the old openSUSE"

No, Arch could be dead easy to use, if they weren't sticking to keeping it close to vanilla, and not assume what people are going to do with different software, and how they want to use it. But since they want to keep it simple there is more of a configuration job for the user, in turn you get a system that is custom tailored to you (And in your own words this makes arch linux impossible to review on a show like LAS, but well they did it.)   OpenSUSE does not promote tumbleweed as the first solution   I'm aware of this, but it doesn't make the burden of a bleeding edge system any less, either the package base is small, and the team is lightning fast with configuring it for the users, and testing it on the different systems and configurations that people may use, or the user has to watch out, which means he hast to be in control of what is on his computer, and how stuff is configured, which doesn't work if the distro is patching and writing configuration files for you.   so if you are looking for it then you know what it is most likely.

LinuxActionShow,3dcnt9,sotolf2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:58:59 2015 UTC,"Tumbleweed is well tested, AND bleeding edge   So you have a small base of packages then?   We have openQA, which is (not arguably this time, it is) the most capable open source functionality testing tool, which we use for system-wide distribution testing ( http://os-autoinst.github.io/openQA )   Well, yeah, automatic testing, and actual use are two different pairs of shoes, you can test as much as you want automatically, with fuzzing, unittest, behaviour tests and so on and so on, and still when it comes to it, things are still being found by people, the thing about tests is that you mostly have to come up with wrong ways of doing things to be able to test them, and no matter how creative you are, people are going to find some other way to use it to make it break.  We have seen it ourself in our company, you build something, test it well and good, then you bring it out, and in 10 minutes someone managed to break it in some way you didn't think about.   We've built a test suite that's comprehensive enough that we know Tumbleweed is always in a usable state before we ship it, and that way we're able to get the bleeding edge stuff out fast   contrast very much with   Tumbleweed is well tested, AND bleeding edge   Testing takes time, so either it well tested, or it comes out fast.   (sometimes faster than Arch.. we did it with GNOME, and now we're fully built on GCC5 which I also believe is before Arch)   Arch is not always the fastest, and it's not meant to be either, it got steam after ubuntu for example. It needs to get through the testing tree, which you can work on if your crazy enough, so that people can test it out on hundreds of different hardware platforms, and then it gets into regular arch.   So no, I don't think 'forcing a learning curve' is required for a rolling distro   Eh, you haven't talked anything about a learning curve at all until now, so why this out of the blue.   It's required for Arch, and I really respect ""The Arch Way"" and all it stands for.   It's requiered for arch mostly out of their philosophy of keeping everything close to vanilla, with only security, or patches that makes it able to work on arch, which means you'll have to set up postgresql for yourself if you want it for example, this makes the learning curve greater, but then again, you have configured it yourself, instead of just getting something someone else configured for you, so you have more of a clue if you want to fix it, change it, and you're able to get help in a very different way, because you were the one setting it up. How does OpenSUSE deal with this, if a user breaks some software or a (well tested) package breaks on some specific hardware, how does the user know what to do?   But I think it's possible to take a rolling distro and give people the tools they need to make it easy to run it without so steep a curve.   It's very possible to make it easy to use, and rolling is no problem whatsoever, bleeding edge is the problem, it by definition is software that isn't necessarily so mature, it may break, or change configuration, and that's the reason I respect arch for saying that you need to take some responsibility yourself, I just don't see how bleeding else is, or should be newbie friendly."

It's primarily a System-wide Functionality Testing tool. It has programmatic 'eyes' that are actually able to read the screen and interpret it's output in addition to traditional 'reading the text output' of other testing tools. It provides input to the system under testing by actually typing the same commands a user will, or moving around the mouse and clicking  So when we say that we know Tumbleweed is in a good state before releasing anything, it's because openQA has quite literally done over 70 different installations with different scenarios, actually used the features we want to test, actually installed the packages we test, started up the services we test, actually logged into the desktops we support and loaded up the applications to make sure they work.  Even when we're doing our 'staging' tests (the closest thing to a Unit test, where we take an incoming Package submission to openSUSE and use OBS to build a new disk image that basically is the 'What-If-We-Accepted-This?' version) test the whole operating system plus the new code, not just the parts of the operating system that relate to the new code.  We don't test everything, but when something does slip past the net that matters to people, we write new tests - and as our tests are all open source also, anyone can contribute new tests for thier software to make sure it remains working in Tumbleweed ( http://os-autoinst.github.io/openQA for Documentation, https://github.com/os-autoinst/os-autoinst-distri-opensuse for Pull Requests for new tests please)  In short, openQA is an open source software testing robot. We've realised if we spent a bit of time on it we could probably now teach it how to play Solitaire on it's own, but once we do that we're probably not that far away from causing a world wide nuclear apocalypse with purple lasers and Terminators.  And as an example of what openQA can do - last night we pushed the first experimental build of Leap 42.1 to http://openqa.opensuse.org  https://openqa.opensuse.org/tests/overview?groupid=7&distri=opensuse&version=42  As it's very early days, there's lots of red there, but to be honest, a lot less than I was expecting out of the first build. Anyone can click on the green or red buttons to see what the build looks like. The 'Logs & Assets' tab in each test also includes a Video recording of the test and a link to the ISO used to the test, so people can get their hands on this very early, not-really-ready-for-human-beings build if they want to test and tinker."

Privacy is in the very fabric of American life, that is why we have security clearances, and confidential information, etc. Privacy is written into our laws for a reason. Why don’t you give every person you meet your social, bank account, or the keys to your house, tell a stranger where your kids goes to school, their name, age etc. Why don’t you tell them? because you don’t trust them and more importantly it isn’t non of their damn business that information is PRIVATE. Everyone has something to hide and rightly so. So whether it is the police or the guy/gal next door you shouldn’t want your personal business out there period. Today it is cool to go get drunk at a party and post it up on Facebook until that very Picture is being scrutinized by an employer, or by the police, or by family, or friends. Is that anyone’s business maybe/maybe not, but that fact is you just made it their business because privacy isn’t important to you. The lack of privacy erodes freedom and democracy, it forces people to think the same, it outcasts decent, and make all of us a targets and sheep to the people that “own” this data. I get it the argument but if we don’t give this information up then how are we going to get these super awesome applications and things that made our life to much easier. But that argument is superficial and shallow. The reason why all of these apps and such are getting better is because we are getting better at giving our information up, allowing people to create profile of our entire life and comparing that with people we know and love and our communities in the end these companies know more about you, your habits, your family, friends, likes, dislikes, etc than you do and for what so that your life can be more convenient? Frankly that line of thinking is irresponsible and just makes everything I and the millions of service member that have died and/or still alive since the inception of our nation meaningless. Privacy is the corner stone of freedom and being free isn’t easy, it takes sacrifice, it is fought for, and it isn’t convenient. Ask the Egyptians that fought for their freedom through social media if they are not targets of their own government now. I will leave you with this. I will leave you with 2 quotes from Gen.

The biggest danger, IMO, is that by banning good encryption we're making the criminal fraternity's life easier and weakening security overall.

When comercial companies collect mass data on us it's to sell us junk we probably don't need. When government does it it's to profile us and the danger of that is that someone or some algorithm makes a judgement on you and your future behavior. We could easily slip into the territories of 'pre-crime' and 'guilty until proven innocent'.  Since technology can't be uninvented, our protection as citizens against potential misuse of our data has to be in law.

This causes people to be more willing to make this transaction, and organizations who realize the potential value of data to collect as much as they can.   Something I have not heard talked about is why the government is trying to collect all of this data. If their stated reason of preventing terrorism is a lie to convince the general public to allow it, then what is their actual motive. I believe it is for the same reason we are spending military resources in the middle east rather than any other place in the world. Valuable resources. $45-$200 per person is not a small amount, and this price is just going to keep going up as we are able to do more things with this data. People usually think of advertising or traffic analysis when considering what data is used for, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. As computers get faster and we start collecting more, data is going to become a very powerful asset in the future."

Most people can adapt to a new workflow. Look at Gnome or Windows 8. Sure people hate it a lot to begin with but they adapt quickly enough. Look at the majority of windows users, they don't change anything.

But look at something like my workflow, I'm mostly working with keyboard only in a tiling wm, to do something like working without a mouse in osx is kind of a major pita.  One big problem that linux has historically been having is a lack of software, but that is just getting better as time goes on.  Of course you will get different service from a company than for linux that isn't having any shops, or technicians to help them out, but I dare say that having someone knowledgeable by you is even better, I've been changing over my whole family, and my wife, and she has a lot less problems with her pc now than she ever had before, I'm not really getting what you're trying to compare here, user friendliness for me would be how easy it is to make the computer work for you, not to change the user so that he/she will work in the way that the computer works, seriously, who is the slave and who is the master? I'd say that a computer should, as much as possible work in the way that the user finds the most comfortable, and it's the reason why I don't install i3 on a computer that my wife uses for example, but she's okay with working with openbox, and it works the way she feels a computer should work.

KDE/Plasma check a couple of high value (to me) boxes for things I look for in a DE.  But there is always this or that which I just can't quite get to my preference, and eventually I find myself back at Gnome, and I can be happy there without a lot of effort.

KDE Plasma 5 removed one of my favorite things about KDE Plasma, the Icons-only Task Manager. So I had to take refuge on GNOME Shell + Dash to Dock extension. They later brought it back but there are still some annoying issues that will only be addressed with 5.4. For example:   https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=345810  https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=340165  https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=346055  Once those are fixed I may look back.

I've always felt like KDE is perpetually almost there, but can never quite get rid of the rough edges.  Where KDE applications tend to win is when you need that one obscure non-standard feature.

Gnome, on the other hand, feels to me like an impeccably polished, unified, cohesive project with a single-minded goal of producing a desktop paradigm which, for my needs, makes me less productive and feels highly unnatural.

Once he shared the tip about really leveraging the virtual desktops for opening new applications and switching between them (vs doing a lot of switching between windows on a single desktop) and turning that into a habit, the whole thing really just fell into place for me.  The reality is probably that I never really used virtual desktops effectively before (even under Compiz or kwin) and doing so puts a nicer spin on the entire Gnome experience.  I still use a bunch of extensions though, and I agree with you in that I wish the Gnome team would act like promoting and not breaking them were as important as they are, but overall I have many less complaints than I used to."

When I use KDE I really like the quality of applications that you find compared to the Gnome equivalents.   You almost feel this is because of QT and the quality and features that this gives to applications compared to the GTK equivalents.   I have tried both Gnome and KDE and always end up going back to KDE.   In general the quality of the applications and the overall feel of a desktop designed to be used as a desktop, not something is trying to be minimalist and appeal to those using a touch screen tablet."

The author is also using a crap implementation of KDE from Fedora comparing it to their flagship Gnome (and the main drivers behind Gnome) is pretty lame as well.  Fedora borked their spin and barely care about KDE.  Gnome feels crippled needing crippled extensions to make it usable, not to mention hideous looking Windows...yuck  Even though 5 is much newer than Gnome 3.x I find it a thousand times better.  5.4 is going to be a great release from kde.  After using KDE apps too, Kdenlive, k3b, ktorrent, konsole, kate, dolphin etc. Gnome apps just pale in comparison   Gnome wants it their way, KDE lets you have it your way."

Nothing ever seems to be where it makes sense to be, the example of the volume slider not being in audio settings being a prime example. Sure it doesn't need to be there, but it makes sense it would be."
LinuxActionShow,3d5ivx,lakerssuperman,0,Wed Jul 15 05:28:25 2015 UTC,"See, I've had largely the opposite experience. I've used Gnome since 3.6, and Enlightenment E17 before that (and further back XFCE/Gnome2/KDE3) I do think that Qt is better, and typically makes better applications than gtk, but the whole desktop experience never feels quite right. Even something like making a panel as a ""dock"" with the icon only task manager never quite works right, it grows to fit new icons but then fails to shrink back when I close them. This kinda thing ends up setting off a nagging sensation in my brain, forcing me to fix it to get back to whatever else I may have been doing. It eventually becomes such an issue I kill the panel entirely and run something like Plank, but then I get the nagging feeling that if it would just effing work I wouldn't need this, and try to make it work again. Repeat ad nauseum for every little thing that ends up bugging me.  As for Gnome 3 being a touch screen/non-desktop thing.... honestly I don't understand this argument whenever it comes up. Gnome does have some design elements that aren't horribly different from what someone would expect on a tablet, but honestly after using it I wonder why people are so attached to the ""old"" way of doing things. I admit that it took some effort on my part, but once my flow adapted to the Gnome I find it rather difficult to go back. E17 taught me to love my Virtual Desktops, I had a 3x3 grid and everything had a specific place it needed to go. Gnome 3 at first drove me crazy, since I couldn't tell a window to just ""go on desktop 5"" and instead had to keep making new ones. Being an experimenter though, I wanted to see how to make it work. I came to the conclusion that for Gnome virtual desktops were made less to contain applications where I put them, and more to contain everything I'd want for a specific task. I start with a desktop that contains my basic needs and create new ones as the things I'm working on demand. Other than some basic window management, I don't actually do much. <Super> left/right tiles things for me, anything that may be used less gets placed under other windows. <Super> alone pops up the overview, and from there alt-tab covers things only open on that desktop. If anything, I feel like Gnome allows me to get more done with just the keyboard than I've ever had possible before, and it does so while looking amazing and functioning stellarly.  After a brief adjustment period, Gnome 3 has become my standard for what every DE needs at a minimum. KDE's approach makes me feel more like I'm dealing with a WM rather than a DE, it has all the parts there for amazing things... if I can put all the pieces together. Gnome comes together without any fuss (now, it admittedly didn't early in 3), where KDE seems an endless sea of tweaking."

For me a few Gnome extensions and turning on the rest of the window controls (min and max) and it functions like a standard desktop.  Gnome Classic is also an option for those that want a little more normal (two panels) without having to worry about getting crazy with installing extensions.

One of SUSE's main selling point with SLE 12 is ""Accelerate Innovation"", and that's not just a pile of management buzzwords, SLE 12 has 'modules' which move faster than the traditional enterprise model, stuff like Developer stacks, Web scripting, DevOps Management tools which SUSE's customers need to move faster than the old fashioned Enterprise-distro that doesn't move much for 10 years. This kind of work greatly benefits from both openSUSE Tumbleweed and Leap to help keep the new versions coming ontop of a stable base.  This manifested itself pretty well during the SLE 12 development - while SLE 12 has a lot in common with openSUSE 13.2, there's actually bits and pieces which were developed and integrated directly from Tumbleweed because the old openSUSE 13.2 release had been 'too conservative'. The current plan for SLE 13 is currently to use a Tumbleweed snapshot as a starting point which'll go through some extra stability period and polishing before becoming the base for SLE 13 and Leap 43.0  So, yes, we're looking to define a new model, where openSUSE Leap is effectively a hybrid, the 'best-of-both-worlds', with a stable Enterprise core and moderately faster moving community parts integrated ontop. Should give openSUSE users something nice, stable, and capable as a more-stable alternative to Tumbleweed, and gives SUSE an 'integration incubator' which should help keep innovations and contributions running both in and out of Tumbleweed and SLE  So far, it's looking pretty exciting, lots of things we haven't worked out yet, but things are coming together nicely."

Also, most ssh keys ""problems"" are easily solved with ssh-keys, they can be backed up, shared, used-reused, etc.  Not bashing, somebody somewhere will find this useful.

How another authentication layer controlled by only one entity with a restrictive license over the product (hey! it uses BSD for some bits!)  is even considered for servers with security in mind?  Again, not trying to win an internet argument. This might be useful for a consultant-amateurish environment were not so many servers or audit policies are involved.

I think part of the problem is the locked down nature of the devices. Most of Android is open and/or free (hence CM and others can take it, modify it and release their own version) however the next step is to bundle drivers etc. Then you are 'supposed' to get verified by Google to have the Play Store etc included. To do this for every Android phone is hard since even just looking at Samsung, there are so many CPU/GPU combos, not to mention other hardware. Multiply this by HTC and others, then throw in x86 platform with even more combos and then pick up the pieces as your head explodes just from thinking about it.  Remember, Android is based on Linux it is not complete GNU+Linux. The Linux kernel has most of these problems solved and rolled in, however Android is stripped down to save space so it cannot have all the extras thrown in to accommodate.

You need the code author's permission (by software licence, which is libre for the codec) to copy and use the code. You need a patent licence (which canonical pays for) to use the patented technology. The patented technology is the file format, that the codec implements. Not the codec itself. These are two completely different things. You have a lot of libre code that cannot be legally used without a patent licence in some countries."

LinuxActionShow,3czc33,yellomango,2,Sun Jul 12 14:53:11 2015 UTC,"I would recommend eclipse and RCP. It can get you started really fast with java. You build applications based on the eclipse platform which can save you time in my experience and with the SWT framework you basically have an application that looks native on each platform. Java is pretty easy to learn if you have worked with any previous OOP language. e4 (RCP) from eclipse introduces a bit of a learning curve with contexts and dependency injection but saves you a lot of time on the long run. If you prefer not to have a dependency on eclipse, you can probably just use SWT and Jface. Then you can use any framework you want and not be bound to the e4 way of doing things. (You can use Guice for di for example which is awesome) For designing the UI, eclipse provides pretty good starting points with the forms designer. Just chose a form from the wizard. If you have models, and would like to go with something similar to a MVC approach, you can create your models with EMF (Eclipse modeling framework) and then use the EMF Forms to do your applications. I have no experience with EMF Forms yet as I only found out about it last week. Alternatively you can also just use jface for databinding."

Anyway I would still recommend it anytime :D What OOP language would you recommend on linux? I don't quite think Python does same job as java, performance wise. Compiled python maybe?

LinuxActionShow,3cvxa3,devillex,4,Sat Jul 11 05:40:35 2015 UTC,I also own a Jolla Phone and had a Ubuntu Phone briefly in hand.  In the terms of stability app performance and apps (native ones) SailfishOS outperformed the Aquaris E 4.5 Ubuntu Phone Edition by far.   One thing you have to keep in mind when it comes to SailfishOS on a non Jolla device is that you won't get the Android Compatibility Layer as this is a license thing that was only licensed for Jolla Phone and no third party images.  I personally would say wait until the next year to buy a SailfishOS phone if its possible as SailfishOS 2.0 will come licensed on other hardware manufactors and probably also on hardware with a little bit better specs.   If you need a new phone as the old one is falling apart. The Jolla might be a good alternative device to try out even despite the mid class specs the device will get updates (and also Sailfish OS 2.0) and performs good enough for everyday tasks.   When it comes to Ubuntu Phone its a matter of taste and the UI Design is good and a little bit more oriented towards Android or iOS switchers but the User Experience is cumbersome.  The swipe guestures there are a little bit frustrating. Especially when it comes to switching apps quickly (a short swipe from the right) or seeing the app list (a long swipe from the right).  Also as the SailfishOS is out longer it has a lot more native apps and almost every app I need I can get as native app already. On the Ubuntu site of things you have to rely more on mobile websites instead on apps.   Ah one thing. If you are living in the US I don't think you can get LTE or 3G with the Jolla Phone. So keep that in mind. If you are living in Europe or India it should work. (Basically everywhere where Jolla officially sells their phone)  And if you want a good device to try them both (yes this is possible) you can buy a cheap nexus 5 somewhere and test both Ubuntu Phone and SailfishOS. Though both images available for it are in a beta kind of state right now.

I have the jolla phone and I am very happy with it. The swiping is a god send (really once you are used to it you miss it when on android).  Android support is great. I use it for my banking apps, but do keep in mind that it is a full android runtime and does not integrate much with sailfishos. Eg you can't use android keyboards on sailfish. So lastpass will loose the ability to simply paste for you. (it will work for android apps but not for sailfish apps).  The community for saiflishos is great. Just have a look at together.jolla.com. Jolla's support is pretty quick and if needed they even let you write to the dev's directly. But hey you can also reach the dev's on together.jolla.com or on IRC.

It's fixed for LO 5.1 and will probably be cherry picked and backported to 4.x and 5.0.x  But, it's not just LO. Google drive and SoftMaker Office 2016 also choke on it.

LinuxActionShow,3cn4cw,kyoei,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:54:15 2015 UTC,"I agree that so far Ubuntu phone disappoints though for completely different reasons than the author.  I really like the UI and interface. I don't find it confusing, and think it's very clean and easy to use. I can't comment on the hardware, because being in the US I only have it on a nexus 4.   Both of my issues unfortunately relate to Canonical being a niche player.   First of course is apps. While Dekko is ok, I think an email client should be a core app of a smartphone. Then a bunch of other apps I use everyday are not available (password manager, owncloud client, vpn client are the most obvious ones that should be easily portable since they are FOSS)  Second, the app life cycle still has issues, and to consistently get notifications the server has to support Ubunut notification service, which of course is very unlikely for any commercial email servers, or anything that doesn't have an open API to write their own client (a la telegram).   These two things severely limit the utility of the device for my use case. I don't need a desktop adapted to a small form factor, I need a smartphone.  Completely aside, I haven't had an update to the core on the N4 since late May on the dev channel. I can only assume that development on the N4 has slowed down to focus on the commercial devices, which of course makes sense from a project planning perspective. I can only hope that they will change the supported hardware to something newer soon.  I know they've said they will have a convergent device with US availability this year, but I think it would be very helpful for adoption if that device were also capable of being flashed to something like Cyanogenmod, so people could dual boot. I think that would make people more willing to buy the device."
LinuxActionShow,3cn4cw,sam_vde,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:13:13 2015 UTC,"If this criticism ultimately touches on the things that would prevent mass adoption, I would embrace it and not shoot the messenger.  I think the hardware element is relative, and I don't get how/why Ubuntu Touch would ever connect to the Google Play Store (???). So okay, that I would take with a grain of salt.  Nevertheless when you buy for example the 300€ phone to use as a daily driver, the interface should be ""there"". Not half-baked, not promising, but functional. I have seen some very different reviews, although it seems most of the people do seem to like it and find it usable.  Then there is the other elephant in the room, and that is apps. I know at least some Canonical people disagree, but I will state again that any credible platform today needs native apps, and that unless Canonical has a budget to get some of the bigger ones ported, this will remain a very big issue.  Let's be honest: if even Jono Bacon wants to think on the idea to base Ubuntu Touch on Android for sake of the apps, we do have a gap. And it seems a significant one for at least a good amount of potential customers."
LinuxActionShow,3cn4cw,GermanyChris,3,Thu Jul 9 08:59:24 2015 UTC,And Jono is wrong. To take Ubuntu Touch and drop it on Android you end up with skinned Android with GMS.

Pretty similar, they share the same base: package manager, packaging, some security policies, SELinux, and more. We often say that Fedora is the testing field of RedHat, this is true on many packages and technologies used on Fedora that will en on a more stable environment RedHat.   If I run Fedora on my laptop, is it going to help me understand RHEL and the specifics of the distro?   Yes, more or less. There area some areas that Fedora will help you to understand on RedHat, like systemd, package management, a few options of SELinux (if you don't disable it entirely), but there are some server specifics that you will see on a RHEL/CentOS server (PAM, LVM and snapshots, advanced networking, security patching, etc). You can always test on a CentOS (because licensing) virtual machine.   I've been running Arch on my laptop for about two years and really enjoy it so I am a little hesitant to give Fedora a go   Well it depends, if you're really happy with your current setup there's no need to switch, as I said: you can learn more about RHEL administration from a CentOS VM than a Fedora desktop setup."
LinuxActionShow,3cjui5,JRRS,4,Wed Jul 8 14:52:27 2015 UTC,Fedora is in a way the test bed for future RHEL releases. Fedora is close to a rolling release distribution with how quickly packages get updated. There are only a few things that remain stable between the releases.  If you want to learn RHEL then I would suggest you give CentOS a spin and generally experiment with it. CentOS is basically a free RHEL with branding stripped out and no support.

Going with both would probably be by far best and most informative choice  Also, at least for me Fedora works much better for development since by the time I finish something, that something shows up in CentOS/RHEL due to coding larger projects being time consuming. If I tried to achieve the same effect on CentOS/RHEL, I would either be stuck with a lot of manual upgrading or simple fact that I would always rely on out of date things when project is finished.

Adding things like screen sharing, Hello, Pocket, etc that would better be handled by extensions.   Early on, Mozilla started Firefox with the idea that Netscape and by extension Seamonkey (the Mozilla Suite) was too bloated. They wanted to have a really good, slim browser that could be expanded as the user saw fit. Not everyone needs everything, so why bog things down for those who don't want something? Well, this worked great, and Firefox really started kicking ass and shaking up the browser market. Eventually along the way, this idea was lost, especially after Mozilla started making changes to mimic what Chrome was doing.  I've been using Firefox since it was known as Phoenix, and things were much different performance wise. If I run an old version of Firefox, I can do things like open a folder of 50 bookmarks with no real issues, but if I were to do the same on a newer version, the system would come to a screeching halt as all resources get consumed.   If Firefox stripped things off, and made them as extensions instead of included features, they could start getting back to the performance they used to have."

Install an LTS kernel and not-cutting-edge Xorg graphics stack by default so that it remains compatible with the lastest proprietary Nvida and AMD drivers?   Highly unlikely. The current newest LTS kernel is 3.18 released in December 2014. That's 'ancient' in Tumbleweed terms, and the significant kernel ABI changes between 3.18 and the latest 4.x are so great we'd probably have to basically build an entire second Tumbleweed distribution in order to pull this off. I'd rather tackle that problem by having people sponsor some hardware so we can test NVIDIA and AMD in openQA. It won't fix things any faster, but it would at least let us know when NVIDIA and AMD are broken before shipping a Tumbleweed release, which might lead us to delaying slightly or at least raising a red flag so NVIDIA and AMD can jump on fixing things."

If you want to leverage your schooling then set up an environment that potential employers can see showing off what you know."

I'm in Japan and when going to jobs interview they always say that my ""credentials"" along with my experience are more than ok. If you just graduated I would recommend just to get a job that you like and get more experience. LPIC-1 and RHCSA they are quite easy to pass if you have some experience in Linux. And by experience I mean to be able to move around the operating system as your own house. You know what's in each drawer, recognize each noise, etc. LPIC is more generic whether RHCSA is only Red Hat.

Actually Arch will break quite easily if you don't put effort into maintaining it.  Run an arch box and do the pacman update once a day, and don't go in and fix any of the minor things you need to tweak, and you'll end up with broken stuff in a few months."

In order for arch to not break you have to put effort into it.  So saying 'what did you do to break it'is not necessarly correct.  You can break it by doing nothing at all, if something needs constant care to keep it from having issues... its wrong to say that it only breaks when you do something.    It's kinda comical because if it were any other product people would say that there is a problem with it. Would you drive a car that every few days you'd have to reset the brakes and check the valve timing, etc?  Nope.  That's be insane, and anyone who went out and bought a car like that would be wrong to say 'this car wont break at all, unless I mess it up'... because in fact the car will only run with constant effort to keep it on the road.  Arch will break on its own.  It's only with user effort that it doesnt break.  So dont act like Arch will only break through user effort/error.  It's only through user effort that Arch remains stable."
LinuxActionShow,3c9hn4,q5sys,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:21:55 2015 UTC,"My point is that you dont have to do anything to have arch break itself.   I really doubt it that an arch system breaks itself if no one installed a single package or started an update... That's kind of a windows thing to do.   In order for arch to not break you have to put effort into it.   Depends on what you call effort, reading the news before updating is mostly enough.   So saying 'what did you do to break it'is not necessarly correct   A linux system doesn't just break unless someone does something to it. An update is also an action, so I'm curious as to what made it break.   You can break it by doing nothing at all,   Nope, it's a machine, no animal, it has no will, and if you don't tell it to do something it won't do anything, that includes breaking.   if something needs constant care to keep it from having issues   Reading the news before updating is not something I'd call taking constant care, what else are you implying has to be done? I don't know, because I'm mostly reading the news and updating, and there's nothing breaking for me really, unless I've done something stupid.   It's kinda comical because if it were any other product people would say that there is a problem with it   Aha how come? Windows systems break themself pretty often, and I see many people using it, and defending it day in and day out.   Would you drive a car that every few days you'd have to reset the brakes and check the valve timing, etc?   That analogy doesn't work unless you're changing something about your breaks before they stop working. Setting up arch is more work, but it's mostly a one time thing.   Nope. That's be insane, and anyone who went out and bought a car like that would be wrong to say 'this car wont break at all, unless I mess it up'   What you're talking about is not something that won't break without you messing up, but something just breaking out of thin air, which are two opposite things, so I don't really get what you're trying to do here, apart from confusing me, which I do admit you are doing right now.   ... because in fact the car will only run with constant effort to keep it on the road.   If you want your linux distro to be like a car that just runs, don't update it, and don't use AUR, you don't send your car in for modification every second day, then get some neighbour to install extra breaks and stuff, and then you complain that the car is a piece of shit because it breaks, it was you going out to the dubious people in the first place making it break.   Arch will break on its own   On what do you base this? Evidence please. This is not something I've seen in 6 years using it. But I guess I don't count since I'm using it.   It's only with user effort that it doesnt break   Again, what is this effort you keep on talking about?   So dont act like Arch will only break through user effort/error.    Arch only breaks if you're doing something to it, do you have a single example of something else? Extraordinary claims requires extraordinary evidence you know.   It's only through user effort that Arch remains stable.   AGAIN, what is this effort you keep talking about?"

Last week I started with a fresh Arch install and Plasma 5...I love it, but it doesn't seem to work for me...plasmashell always froze after a moment (basically it drove the cpu up to 100% and the panel became unusable - everything else was still working though!). Anyway, I tried it on my desktop and laptop (both from Linux vendors) but without any luck. In dire need of a working computer I quickly set up Linux Mint 17 KDE and while I really like it, it's not Arch...  In the meantime, I tried Arch+Gnome on my laptop, but somehow it doesn't feel right...guess I became too attached to KDE over the years. So, long story short...can't live without Arch but I also need a stable KDE environment for work. This means I'll be running Mint on the Desktop and Arch on my laptop...at least for a while. Then again, if I had the time, I'll probably try to get things done in Gnome and play with a couple of potential distro backup-alternatives..."
LinuxActionShow,3c9hn4,rinoka,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:41:01 2015 UTC,"I've only been a dedicated Linux user for about 3-3.5 years now. Most of this time I've been hopping around between Debian, Ubuntu and Ubuntu derivs. I personally keep finding myself desiring XFCE or MATE  over newer desktops. I've found that while I like GNOME 3 and Unity, I end up desiring a more traditional environment, usually XFCE or MATE with a single panel at the bottom (very Windows '95 through Vista style). The simplicity of having everything I could possibly need to know about what my computer's doing in a 24-pixel high row at the bottom of my screen is just so convenient even if a bit ""old"". Mint Maya was the first distro I really attached myself to and on a whim yesterday I checked out the 17.2 release notes and saw that they now support nvidia-prime! I'd been back and forth between Xubuntu and UbuntuMATE for the last year or so primarily because of the Optimus support, but now that prime is supported in MDM, I've made the switch back.  I've always had a stigma of Mint being a beginner's distro (which I'm not arguing against) but after hearing Noah's interview with (the guy whose name or company I can't remember) at SELF, I was surprised to hear someone with such a higher-level Linux knowledge say they ran it as their primary. For me, getting past the stigma of certain distros and the ""bragging rights"" that may come with others, I've come to terms with how I really want to use my computer. Coincidentally, Mint installs the packages I prefer to use and it saves me time in configuring my system. With 8 and 6 year-old sons at home and being out of the house for 12 hours a day for work, that time savings is kind of a big deal for me.  But, to each his own. You're the only person who will ultimately be able to convince yourself what you need to run. Don't be surprised to find yourself bouncing around, distro-hopping every few months.

LinuxActionShow,3c8bhk,Robsteady,2,Sun Jul 5 21:16:08 2015 UTC,"Robsteady,  Thank you so much for your feedback. That's very interesting. Actually, for over a year (up until a few months ago) I was doing something very similar.  I was using BTSync as my Sync client of choice, together with ownCloud...because in my experience no native Sync client on earth...compared to BTSync.  Then when Sync 2.0 came out, they screwed all of us over.  Most of us BTSync refugees have moved over to Syncthing. It's not entirely ready for primetime, but it's getting there.  Right now I have both, an ownCloud and a Pydio Server. I'm trying to setup Pydio (v6.+) to function the way I have ownCloud (v.8.04) working.  With ownCloud, I have users that belong to certain 'Groups'. Members of these groups can easily share files/folders 'internally' with other members of these groups.  So you can very easily setup an ACME Group folder, shared by one of the ownCloud Group members or the ACME Group's Admin and whatever is uploaded to/moved to/copied to that shared directory instantly becomes available to the rest of the members of that group.  I was trying to do the same thing with Pydio, but I'm having trouble grasping the way that Pydio handles Workspaces/Groups and Roles.  I think I may have got it, but if I did...I don't see the point of 'Groups' in Pydio.  I was able to do it by creating a custom Workspace then assigning a unique 'Role' to it. Then, applying that 'Role' to specific users.  Still, the Administrative Management of Pydio is something I'm not used to.  Now I need to figure out how to enable/set storage quotas, why my share link isn't working (or do I need to configure that as well) and how to setup email notifications and glue in my FTPS external storage. Which ironically, seems broken in ownCloud for whatever reason.  DJ"

And no, commercial Android isn't open source (unless you can provide a link to the source code of the Google Play store and the programs that are installed with it?)  I understand that Jolla's main business will be (if they are successful) selling OS licenses, customization and/or support to OEMs. Google's main business is providing a tailored search and advertisement. So this far they would seem to have less of a motive for ""being evil"" than Google. One thing I worry is that at the moment, Jolla is a bit too tied on Android - for example, the native Jolla ""store"" doesn't exactly support paying for the apps.

Thats a risk. linux has support in the server world, there is also companies like canonical etc... Kind of disappointed, Dell sells the xps with linux, but then argues against open source.

It might happen that a small project stops because the key developer leaves. That's unlikely for big projects which are widely used. Those projects have not just 2 developers also companies do a big part of the development.  There are many companies providing support around opensource. With opensource it's even possible to change the company you have a support contract with while keeping the platform.   Why have the users to patch vulnerabilities them self? If the project is still alive the developers will provide a patch. If not, everyone else can patch it. When there is a serious vulnerability patches are out within days sometime hours. With closed source software that is unlikely.  If you are a big enterprise you could stick to a OS software even after the project is dead. You need to hire someone who is maintaining the code.  Compare that with closed-source. If a closed-source project is dead you need to buy a new product.

And most grandma's and grandpa's already have their basic apps and don't go installing their own for the most part anyways. They just want to do their basic stuff. And if linux can't supply that. Then nobody should be putting them on linux in the first place. The one's that do get linux are usually someone in the know and sets it up for them and their needs. And read plenty of success stories of family members that have been using linux successfully without issues. But they generally have Linux geek in the family to hold their hand and occasionally fix issues for them. Just like families in the windows world.

It's only exciting to Chris because he knows one of the main devs personally. I'm deploying Linux Mint on a family member's machine because Cinnamon is getting stable and is actually a modern desktop they can easily understand.  On the other hand Chris is right about Linux Mint never getting broad adoption, but that would be the case even if they were cutting edge. Only a distro with a large corporation behind it will ever get large scale OEM deployment.  EDIT: I also thought it was a little bit ironic that the host of the Linux Action Show announced on Linux Unplugged that the Linux brand is unusable.

Distros like Mint want to capture a consumer market, which requires one set of compromises, but they have to do so by way of the enthusiast, which requires another set of compromises.  Distros that are popular maintain a balance of keeping enthusiasts interested, while providing a stable option for the consumer.  Doing only one or the other doesn't work long-term."

Since then I truly considered to try an LTS or even Debian stable because I was so tired of all that bugs.  Now I'm on Ubuntu GNOME 15.04 and I can stress it without issues. I don't trust Canonical and that decision doesn't feel very well but at least I can get some work done."

The Mumble Room guys reallymake the LUP show. Without them, you would be talking to yourself. Stop interjecting.

But it's unfair to say that Linux Mint is boring... That is hurting the pride of its devs for no reason.  Linux Mint is Community based, and like all community based distros, they care first about their community's needs (e.g fixing/bringing multi monitor support). There is no need and no purpose for them to create a new packaging format (although that's pretty exiting) and so they'll just work on like this as long as they like...  They don't need commercial success, so they don't need hype and excitement as much as Canonical, but they have a brilliant eco system and are not at all boring."

I miss my Steam games man and I really don't want to go to a system where suddenly those are, once again, not available to me.  There were other issues that probably had to do more with KDE than anything else, but I did not enjoy my time with PC-BSD and wound up appreciating my Ubuntu install even more.  Ofc, it may be a totally different experience for you.

I'm pretty sure I've been up to my elbows in Linux longer than Chris has known what it was. I've been living solely with Linux (and FreeBSD) since 2005. I love software pushing the envelope, but I don't want that on my workstation. I don't want bleeding edge (read buggy) software on the machine I use to make my living and play my games on. I can't tolerate sitting down to work and finding my DE has entirely changed out from under me, or an update crashed the machine, or some critical software version was swapped out which breaks my workflow, etc. I have machines where I can tolerate that. Those are my toy machines and I run all kinds of distros on those. But, on my machines where I work and game, I run Linux Mint. ""It Just Works"".. In those environments I don't want my versions and DE changing out from under me. I'm a big fan of JB, but man I kinda felt like Chris completely dismissed me as a Linux user, and likening me to some Windows noob or a Apple handcuff wearing fan boy because I use a reasonably stable Linux distro somewhat pisses me off."

Did computer decides  what to install on not so stable OSes? OK, on a rolling release ""train"" you can miss this important update. But on fixed release you can get new UI version only by next release. And if you don't want any unexpected UI change ever - manually customized WM is your best bet.     I don't want bleeding edge (read buggy) software     So you want old software with old bugs not yet fixed?

LinuxActionShow,3bppdf,oj0,2,Wed Jul 1 17:19:59 2015 UTC,"I'm one of the first people of this community that points out a Chris rant when it happens, mostly because of his strong opinions about the linux journalism ecosystem, that (actually) he belongs to.  But over his bad choice of words, putting his feelings over the facts on a topic, and the constant contradictions of ideas and actions: dude's right.  Stable is not generally boring, of course not. But for a show (and a whole network) that main theme is the ""newest and the greatest of the linux desktop"" of course it is boring, is not news. 95% of the content of LUP & LAS is about new, often untested or unstable, software and hardware for the installation junkies. This subreddit goes around the circlejerk of backups and reinstalls.  So look at it on his perspective: stable is boring for the business, is not a general rule, is not written on stone, and Chris doesn't state that.  Now, for the rest of the rant: is a piece of crap. Almost all of it can be replied with a structured answer based on facts and sustained arguments (nost of the comments here already done that). So Chris (and community) turn in down a couple of notches, you're not discussing global economy here, just Linux desktop, take it easy."
LinuxActionShow,3bppdf,hyphone,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:44:40 2015 UTC,"There is a nugget of truth in his rant, but I feel Chris was blowing that nugget way out of proportion and using extremely poor wording for everything. I think everyone is focusing too much on Chris saying distros need to be exciting (and reading into it that he means everyone should be rolling (and everyone assuming that rolling can't be stable and usable by the uninitiated or those trying to get work done)) and are ignoring the fact that Linux itself is currently doing very exciting things.  I'm being pretty liberal with what he said, but I didn't personally think he was saying that we can't/shouldn't have something stable that doesn't change much, it felt more like he was saying not that Mint would die, but that nobody will care about Mint 17.2 in even as small a time as a few months. The pace Linux is currently evolving at may wholly change the landscape by their next release, and a ""boring"" release from a community like Mint can potentially kill interest in the project while developers are looking at the near future possibilities.  Taking a re-listen to the rant thinking he's just wording everything poorly makes far more sense. Under any other interpretation his responses to the guests seem rather preposterous and weird. Once I started assuming Chris was not an idiot, just talking like one, I started seeing the above pattern. I think this is what he was on about, but it is admittedly very much a guess."
LinuxActionShow,3bppdf,oj0,0,Wed Jul 1 17:52:47 2015 UTC,"Agree with you, people just don't listen carefully enough and start to get angry (or too exited?). Anyway Chris hasn't baked enough his thoughts to clearly express them on this matter. Linux Mint landed with a bang: pretty, user friendly, with extra stuff, etc. Very appealing... for a new ""Linux"" user. As for more experienced ""Linux"" user you find defaults lacking. So You start tinkering with it adding PPA for newer stuff, etc. But adding that extra stuff takes more effort then in other less stable Linux OSes, and it can also introduce stability issues. While Linux Mint is user friendly for new L users, for experienced L users - it won't stand out like it compared to other distros."
LinuxActionShow,3bppdf,onelostuser,2,Wed Jul 1 20:38:39 2015 UTC,I understand but as an experienced user someone might have a tiny travel laptop that's just lying around for let's say six months. Doing now an Arch update after that time would be a funny experience.

There is no scope-creep associated with generic platforms, and the project aims to provide a modern and focused desktop-centric solution, that is designed to keep out of the way of the user, working intuitively with virtually no configuration required. As such there is a stronger emphasis on multimedia and “home-computing” enabling, as well as enabling desktop users to go about their daily professional lives with ease.  It is available as an installable LiveCD, and is only available for x86_64 computers (64-bit). UEFI support now exists as of Solus Operating System Beta 2.

We concentrate on keeping it close to the metal, optimising specifically towards a desktop experience, vs a generic run-anything distro (You won't be using Solus as a server distro in a hurry, or a VM guest)  Way more vanilla than most. We'll patch security issues in a timely fashion, and ofc we patch build failures (upstreaming where relevant). Other patches are simply cosmetics, such as default GTK theme in GSettings.  No conflicts of interest in project management. It is my baby, and not the product of corporate interest. Solus will in time become a company, but self-owned and self-controlled.   It's also the only new ""from scratch"" distro to actually come round in a while that's deliberately pegged for mainstream usage on the desktop, i.e. at home (we'll go the OEM route) and for work.  I have similar project aims to some others out there, that cater for say, multimedia usage.

Right when you need it is when you'll discover that laptop's disk is dying a horrible death and/or has been silently corrupting data. Run ZFS in some variety of a redundant config (if you don't want to take the FreeBSD plunge then use ZFS on Linux http://zfsonlinux.org ).  My server is FreeBSD running on ZFS for both root and my datastore. For my backups I incrementally ZFS send the filesystems and snapshots to an external USB ZFS drive on my Linux workstation (see ZFS on Linux above), then for offsite I incrementally ZFS send a monthly snapshot via SSH to a raspberry pi running FreeBSD connected to an external USB ZFS drive located at my parent's house.

LinuxActionShow,3bikxh,Corky98,3,Mon Jun 29 16:39:00 2015 UTC,"No mailbox is 100% confidential. To get even remotely close, BOTH parties of an email (your and the person to which you are sending an email) must accept encrypted messages, with secure connection protocols, and servers on both sides must be in-house, under the control of you, or a trusted party. Even if you are 100% in-house and secure on your end, if you send an email to someone at gmail who doesn't encrypt, all the security goes out the window.   Remember: email is a postcard. Even if you put it in an envelope, it can still be opened by an unscrupulous mail carrier. And if you put it in a locked, secure device, the other person you send it to still has to have a key, and you still have to trust that no one is going to break the lock in transport. You either have to hire a trustworthy courier, or deliver it yourself.   Plus, if you try to run an email server from a residential ISP account, you're going to have a bad time. Residential IP address blocks are blacklisted by pretty much all mail services. So, in order to run an email server from home, you either need some sort of VPN service that will make it appear that you are coming from a business class service with a static IP, or you need to purchase a business class account from your ISP with a static IP address.   Anyone who promises 100% security on anything is lying to you."

The GetOnSIP service Noah mentioned is actually a freebie service by OnSIP who provide a hosted PBX service (so you can have you@yourdomain.com as your SIP address).  OnSIP have a simple Pay As You Go tariff which i've been using for free for the past 5 years with a hardware Yealink phone.  The GetOnSIP and hosted OnSIP services are linked so i can log into the GetOnSIP site with my OnSIP credentials and one of the nice things that GetOnSIP provide is a WebRTC bridge.  So there's a URL that anyone can go to and call me, for free, directly through their browser.  Since my hardware phone supports multiple lines i use (Get)OnSIP only for a personalised SIP URI and for the WebRTC stuff.  My main phone line is provided by Localphone (my affiliate link).  The calling rates are quite low and the quality of calls is adequate.  Android actually has a SIP client built-in, but it's quite well hidden (on Lollipop 5.1 open dialler app, press hamburger menu, Settings, Calls, Calling Accounts, Internet calling (SIP) accounts) and some manufacturers may have removed it from their own builds.  I use this built-in client for outbound calls using my Localphone account and have been able to switch to a mobile tariff that has no minutes or texts, just 2GB data (£5.11/month).  It integrates completely with the dialler and when dialling can be set to pop up a little window asking what account you want to call from or you can set a default account (mine's set to always call via SIP).  I have been meaning to setup my own SIP server for years now to consolidate this stuff in house, but i just keep getting distracted by other new shiny projects. :D  Maybe i'll get around to it sometime soon.  I'd prefer to use FreeSWITCH since i think it's a better project than Asterisk, but it will require more work which is one of the reasons i keep putting it off.  The VoIP Users Conference has a weekly conference all about current and developing VoIP technologies.    On a non-SIP note one of the features of Localphone is that you can buy DIDs (phone numbers) and forward them to other numbers.  This has come in handy for my mother who lives in Portugal but gets free calls to UK landlines, and my sister who lives in Greece but only has a mobile phone.  Instead of my mother calling her mobile directly and paying a lot for calls, she rents a UK DID from Localphone for £1/month and has it forward to my sister's Greek mobile.  She can call the UK number for free and only pay Localphone's £0.057/minute rate for forwarding the call to Greece (about 1/5 the cost of calling my sister's mobile directly from Portugal)."

Created by the guys who develop Asterisk the Digium handsets have to be the simplest devices to deploy with more features tailored to this specific PBX platform.  I have been breaking and fixing Asterisk since 2005 and have used most hardware, software combinations with various circuit providers and SIP breakout companies. I have now settled with Digium handsets and AsteriskNow for my Asterisk distro, mainly because it is ready to go with the digium modules required for their handsets.  The handsets feature a custom app api so that you can develop your own apps and also bundle with some apps such as managing the Asterisk queues, parked calls, status or visual voicemail. You can also upload a company logo to your devices from the Asterisk web gui which I find seems to impress customers ;-)  Deployment is a dream. Plug in the handset. upon bootup it finds your asterisk server and lists the user extensions that have not yet been assigned to a handset. Select your new user and it will reboot and come up with their configuration. The only criticism I have about the handsets is that they are a little lacking in high frequencies - or is it just a heavy bottom end? Either way we don't get any complaints from our staff.  Back in 2010 I deployed Asterisk to our company - 1000+ seats in 20+ offices and due to the relationship we built up with our SIP breakout provider we ended up becoming a platinum partner and now resell our systems to external customers with their white label billing platform.

The phone looks for its configuration via at every boot.  So if you need to make some adjustments, you don't have to go into the phone's slow website and adjust some fields.  Just tell the user to unplug and plug in their phone or press ""*-6-Settings"" for a soft reboot.    After the phone checks for the latest firmware, it then looks for the default file and then registration file.  So between the default and registration file you can fine tune each phone.  Once you have a working registration file,  keep things simple and copy it as a template.  So roll out for new installations can happen in a far fewer amount time that fooling with the SPAs.  Boot phone, configure tftp address, unplug phone, look for the serial number on the back of the phone, copy and rename a template file based on the serial number and repeat the process for the next phone.  Once all the phones are done.  Edit each created registration file and assign login credentials. Finally, add the extensions to asterisk.  Sure there will be some fixing of wrongly entered information, but all that is at the script level and all you tell the client is to reboot the phone."

We used some Polycom 430s in places that didn't get much use, but audio and display quality seem to be reduced on them. Have also used a few Cisco SPA5xx series phone with little issues...In fact I have one department with all SPA508Gs now, and little complaints. Would say they are a bit better than the Polycom 430, but no where close to the Polycom 650. The Grandstream phones we've tried have been a little flaky, but they are very inexpensive. Going with the solid phone like the Polycom 650 really made the conversion to SIP a success, especially looking at the alternatives available at the time in 2006/7. Had we gone cheap and used flaky phones, user revolt would have had us putting in a dozen KSUs again pretty quickly."

When I first got into voip, I purchased a couple used linxsys spa942 since that's what my old job had. If I would start now, I'd get the polycom vvx410, although evidently polycom can be weird sometimes. I do have the vvx410 and really like it. yealinks aren't bad, better than the spa942s.  At work we were on a hosted platform but it was very, very expensive. I tried to talk my boss into onsip but he didn't want hosted so I talked him into purchasing a cudatel, a freeswitch based server with a web based gui. We didn't have to replace any of the existing phones and we can do plenty of the cudatel vs. a shortel or something. We're using a PRI from level 3 with 21 channels.   I wish my company would have gone with flowroute as the provider. Since we're in las vegas, along with flowroute's connection, I have a 1.9ms ping average to sip.flowroute.com from our office:  --- sip.flowroute.com ping statistics --- 5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0.0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 1.783/1.888/1.977/0.086 ms"

LinuxActionShow,3bgtwj,jdblaich,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:24:28 2015 UTC,"I've been using Asterisk with Google Voice since nearly the beginning of Google Voice.  I started on an old computer, but later switched to a Raspberry Pi due to its low power use.  The implementation of Asterisk with Google voice integration is quite nice now.  I'm no where near as sophisticated as the others here.  I have a simple install on the raspberry pi that serves my small business with 2 numbers and my home where it handles 4 numbers (I just keep the 4 alive for when I might potentially use them).  Both of these use a simple PAP2 adapter, a cordless phone, and a model b raspberry pi.  Much of my major concern behind switching (about 5+ years ago) was switching my number.  I had a POTS line for my main number and then got the Google Voice number that I use now.  I was able to grab the POTS line phone number by transferring it to a cheap Tracfone, then from there to Google Voice.  My phone service costs went down to $0 and all is good.  I've tried to get people to switch over the years, but have encountered resistance due to the instability of using Google Voice with Asterisk.  The Asterisk implementation with Google Voice support is much much better now, however Google Voice isn't offering any new numbers.  Noah's implementation is through a third party which is all and good because he can connect into his system from anywhere, wherever he plugs in his Sip phone. I like it.  I like his passion.  I've refrained from paying anything for my phone service over the years.  I've found that hangouts works well for making and receiving calls through Google Voice.  There's a setting in there that tells Google Voice to ring that number, so technically I don't need a Sip app other than hangouts.  EDIT:  Anyone know the difference between the CISCO spa303-g1, the spa303-g, and the spa303?"
LinuxActionShow,3bgtwj,jimmymarbles,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:13:34 2015 UTC,I believe they are different generations.  I've been using the spa525g2 and the difference from the g1 was the addition of bluetooth.  So I assume the 303 generations would include added functionality.

Download the Asterisk ISO, install it on a machine, from the Applications menu when you login to the web UI click on Extensions, create two extensions. BOOM you're done, you have a working Asterisk box.   For outgoing calls Create a Trunk and an Outgoing Route, fill in the authid and password your SIP provider (like RingCentral or OnSip) gives you, For matching Numbers in the outgoing route put an X. and you'll be able to make outgoing calls. I bet it takes you no more than 10 minutes once you have Asterisks installed.

The keys themselves are very thin plastic and the scissor switches feel like they could give out at any moment just by breathing on them. I replaced its keyboard twice. I just resigned myself to knowing that my backspace will pop off at least a few times a day.   On the T440, the keyboard is great. But the trackpad is awful.

But I resist making that assumption considering the behavior we've seen up until now. This could just as well be them uncomfortably sweeping the issue under the rug as opposed to meeting in the middle. So, while I'm glad that things have calmed down, I don't know if I should trust the spirit of the joint memo and believe this behavior won't happen again in the future.

It should put focus on the folder you just left, instead it does the win95 thing and jumps to the first item in the folder.  It's that little annoyance that pokes me every single day.

LinuxActionShow,3b8den,pierre4l,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:27:05 2015 UTC,"I use the back button regularly for what it is intended to do, but the back button is very, very different from the up button. Let's say I have been doing something in a few folders repeatedly jumping back and forth (without using back/forward buttons). If at some point I decide to use the back button I will replay my jumping back and forth.  Let's imagine one of the folders are positioned midway down a parent folder with 500+ subfolders. Now, after having been jumping back and forth between these folders A, B, C, and D, I want to proceed (from folder D) to folder E which is the folder (alphabetically) next to folder D, do I ""back-button"" until I reach a position close to E or do I up-button from D and navigate my way down to folder E? In windows, Gnome/Nautilus, and Mac the up-button is a no-brainer, it lands me in the parent folder with focus on D, I'd just arrow down a folder and continue my work, don't even have to think - all pure muscle memory. In KDE OTH I'd have to move down looking closely for the folder in question, making sure I remember which one. Often I'd have to check several folders to make sure I'm in the right one.  Or: if I jumped directly to folder D and want to proceed to folder E then there is no history and hence no back-button action.  Unfortunately this is a scenario I'm facing at least once a week and sometimes this is the nature of a project which means I'm faced with the issue repeatedly 8-12 hours a day. It's not the end of the world, I use the ""show files/sub-folders"" (I think it's called) and it works. It is an issue that's a daily annoyance for me, and I don't understand why it hasn't been fixed years ago. I don't see any advantage to current behavior, getting to the top is not hard (push ""home""), getting the to the next subfolder in a folder with hundreds of subfolders is hard and the system should help you.  I've made it a habit noting on paper the folder I'm going to, which is obviously totally ridiculous - but necessary."
LinuxActionShow,3b8den,Synes_Godt_Om,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:34:54 2015 UTC,"If you're using the breadcrumb directory view in Dolphin, rather than clicking 'Up' you can click the deepest '>' whereupon the current folder should be highlighted (in my case it's in bold, but that may be theme dependent). Admittedly, if it's a huge directory the current folder may not be in the first vertical list and you have to navigate via 'More', which is annoying. But it at least avoids needing to write down on paper which folder you were in.  I haven't ever encountered a situation personally where the behaviour you desire would be useful to me, but I can see where it might throw me a bit. If I have more than one tab or instance of Dolphin open and I navigate to a folder above one that is open elsewhere, that could result in the focus being not at the top but at some other point in the tree. I guess you would want this behaviour isolated only to the active tab or instance.  There are possibly other ways to work around the issue by using a different approach. For instance, if you go to Control > Panels, and enable 'Folders', when you navigate in the main panel, the open folder remains expanded in the Folders panel, so you can see where you were before, even if that still requires some scrolling. Another caveat here is that all expanded folders remain that way, even if I close a tab and open a new one to the same folder."
LinuxActionShow,3b8den,pierre4l,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:06:50 2015 UTC,"you can click   No, that would need me to use the mouse, it would be cumbersome.   If I have more than one tab or instance of Dolphin   Two different instances should not interfere with each other. But that may be the reason. Perhaps dolphin works in a way where different tabs and instances do interfere. That would explain why it hasn't been fixed. If by design dolphin can't do this, I think I'll explore other possible file managers then. I think I saw something about a new file manager in the works recently.  Other file managers do it without issue: nautilus does it, windows file manager does it. Mac's file manager does it. Other types of object browser generally do it too - to me that's the natural way to browse a hierarchy. The only time I've encountered dolphin's behavior is with PCmanFm (lubuntu), dolphin and win95/98/2k file explorer. Even the old win3 fileman did it and it was one of the complaints about the new file manager in win95/98/2k.  My ideal file manager would have dolpin's folder option you mentioned combined with nautilus' up navigation and the way it handles handles typing parts of a file/folder name."

It's curious that the hate between Kubuntu and Ubuntu is to some extend mirrored by the hate from non-*buntu KDE'ers towards Kubuntu. I mean I regularly see very derogatory comments against Kubuntu whenever there is a bug or an issue it will be attributed to ""the total shit that is Kubuntu"".  I followed this conflict brewing since last year. There are real issues and they don't seem to be solved yet. OTH what Canonical is trying to achieve is not trivial and shouldn't just be dismissed. Putting out a high end phone with actual support from big manufacturers and carriers when you are a small company is something that carries a tremendous risk - just think of the billion dollar law suits flying around. If some mega troll thinks there's money to be had from Canonical they'll crush them. I'm sure the CLA is part of this - even if Mark has been too sloppy about it (I don't know he has but it sometimes feels that way).

LinuxActionShow,3b68pl,rbrownsuse,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:27:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation. I think that maintaining Tumbleweed and an enterprisey LTS release would make a lot of sense.

So, yes, I'd recommend it  For your mother's computer, I'd also recommend it, but I'd ask you to consider GNOME because I think the patching model we have there (using PackageKit with systemd) is more 'mother-friendly'"
LinuxActionShow,3b68pl,rbrownsuse,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:46:24 2015 UTC,"which does go some way to undermine the 'point' of the traditional  openSUSE release model.   Tumbleweed is bleeding-edge, which can break things. OpenSUSE is cutting-edge, with an 8 month release cycle but with repositories that let you selectively run newer versions of the kernel, desktop, LibreOffice, etc.  No one's going to use a rolling distro on desktops that need to work 8+ hours a day, 5 days a week.   Killing off OpenSUSE may cause an exodus to Fedora as the remaining non-rolling cutting-edge desktop release."
LinuxActionShow,3b68pl,alcalde,2,Mon Jun 29 00:36:24 2015 UTC,"but with repositories that let you selectively run newer versions of the kernel, desktop, LibreOffice, etc.   Those extra repositories have never been an official part of the openSUSE distribution. They're available to be used 'at your own risk', but we give no promise regarding reliability (will it work?) or maintainability (when will it be patched?). In fact, most of those repositories are intended to be BROKEN as they're the place where new versions are prepared before they are good enough to be part of Tumbleweed.  If you're the kind of person who likes openSUSE because of those extra repositories, you should REALLY consider using Tumbleweed instead - we test everything in Tumbleweed, as a whole, including the applications to make sure they work. That's a huge step forward compared to the openSUSE+Devel Repos approach you're advocating here.   No one's going to use a rolling distro on desktops that need to work 8+ hours a day, 5 days a week.   I do, and I recommend others try using Tumbleweed before dismissing the concept"

LinuxActionShow,3axq6u,Rajat_Pandita,6,Wed Jun 24 10:03:20 2015 UTC,"Yes I work at IBM (not in India though), it is RHEL 6.5 (good old Gnome 2.3x) with OpenClient as the default OS on every desktop, laptop and workstation provided by the company (Thinkpad ftw!). The only areas ""allowed"" to run Windows natively are financial and account areas and also project managers and so. There are internal repositories with Windows KVM machines images but you need special permissions to run those.  The default GUI haves something like the old OpenSuSe gnome menu, but you can switch to traditional two panel gnome. Repositories and access to software are highly controlled and restricted. All must come from ""in house""."
LinuxActionShow,3axq6u,JRRS,2,Wed Jun 24 17:53:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for confirming.. It was good to hear IBM Switching to Linux on the Desktop!! I missed the bus I guess I left just a month before the switch to RHEL in India!!
LinuxActionShow,3axq6u,ju2wheels,4,Wed Jun 24 20:00:32 2015 UTC,"Yes this is true and its not new. I worked for IBM for 6 years (just left a month ago) and we had always had access to Ubuntu and RHEL with company addons (mostly internal software and hardening configurations) for use on our laptops.  The releases are called IBM Open Client internally.  Over the last few years, remaining Windows users were forced into RHEL 6  (although most admins or technical people were probably already using it for quite longer).  Using Windows was mostly restricted to being used in KVM especially the more you dealt with sensitive customer information. I used Ubuntu with VBox but plenty of my colleagues use RHEL/KVM as it had more automation so as not expect end users to know how to use KVM (it autodownloaded and setup an internal Windows KVM image, really ugly imaging process TBH but it was most likely to prevent us from taking the actual image).  The RHEL 6.5 is stock Gnome 2 (Ive never seen any customizations in the GUI, although you are free to customize it however, they arent overly strict on what you can customize. I used Gnome 3 on my Ubuntu) with IBM Open Client logos (its a circle with tux in the middle and different distro logos around it in circular fashion like suse, ubuntu, rhel etc indented into slots like the slots in the ubuntu logo for the small circles).  The Windows KVM image is Windows 7 and again has all the similar security customizations and software as Open Client (Lotus Notes, Lotus Symphony, ATT VPN, OS hardening).  For the most part, if you were an admin, the recommended setup was Linux with a VM to access and do any work within the datacenters you managed (be it Windows or another Linux instance).  In the datacenters (I managed about 4 worldwide with almost 1k machines each) they were mostly RHEL, with a splattering of Windows 2008. Some of IBMs newer acquisitions were using Debian/Ubuntu but they were the exception and more probably than not were doing so because they were using modern software stacks and it made it easier.  [Edit] Overall RHEL 6 is the official standard image everyone is supposed to use (company wide, not just India) and Ubuntu was available for ""early adopters"" which basically meant you better know your Linux sh*t because its not officially supported (but even so we had a large community inside IBM using it and supporting each other). I do think they must have been working hand in hand with Canonical behind the scenes to do a lot of that as I recall they had once gotten special images.  [Edit 2] Based on the above post it seems they may have changed the newer RHEL images, I had the same RHEL image for years and just upgraded on through so I may not have gotten the new Gnome menu customizations (or maybe I removed them, dont recall)."

LinuxActionShow,3awvvs,AngelaTHEFisher,17,Wed Jun 24 03:48:05 2015 UTC,"I love JB, and I know LUP is meant to be an opinion show, but I really feel like it's started to jump out to me how much the journalistic integrity of JB has started to slip.  I have an example in this episode.  Let's be frank, Chris is dealing with pretty profound cognitive dissonance between convenience and freedom.  The perfect example was the Mac in his video production pipeline...he fought for years criticizing the options under Linux, until Noah forced the issue, then he found out that it worked ok.  Now we're seeing the same thing with Google's services.  Chris thinks Google is going evil, and really hates what they're doing a lot of the time, but it's still too cool and convenient to switch off.    That's a fine position, and you can say that, and rail against them, and even switch off, etc etc.  Hell, tell everyone that they're evil and really reach out to the audience for real alternatives, and use your influence to encourage the libre-free alternatives to improve.  All of that is great.    But go to 1:12:50 in this episode, and listen to what you ask Wimpy:   :: Plays ""And the value of this is negative"" RMS drop :: Is this once again RMS being right, or are we overreacting? Is this what we get for using a proprietary browser by an advertising company that wants to make life more convenient?   That's a Blonde-Fox-News-Anchor level leading question right there.  How many ""evil"" buzz words can you slip into a question?  More and more I've seen this in JB shows, Chris asking either the audience or just asking rhetorical questions with obvious ""correct"" answers under the guise of ""the jury is still out.""  There's even been some fake ""Hmm, I don't know, I guess we'll have to see"" as if a conclusion hasn't already been drawn...it happens a lot in TTT.  It's disingenuous.  If you're gonna have an opinion, say it, don't play this game of trying to lead the audience to the ""right"" answer.  It's almost insulting.  If you think it's bad, say it.  If your mind is made up, say it.  If someone says something to change your mind, say that when it happens.  You've done it in the past, say ""Someone tell me why I'm wrong"" and debate it.  But presenting news and asking questions like that is really just setting up an echo chamber of confirmation...the JB audience is good at not being swayed and standing their ground (heck, Wimpy replied back with to that question above with ""Chromium isn't proprietary"") but it really should be incumbent on Chris to avoid that, especially when rallying against other poor journalism in the industry.  Again, I mean for this to be constructive and I listen to everything JB, it's just really starting to jump out at me.  I just don't want to get to the point where I have to think ""well that's what JB says the truth is, but what's the real unbiased unfiltered story?"""
LinuxActionShow,3awvvs,surfrock66,-1,Wed Jun 24 17:02:19 2015 UTC,"I'm generally OK with that on a show like LUP, since Chris's job is to lead and facilitate the discussion.  But there is no ""correct answer"" for the Google is evil thing because it is incumbent upon each user to decide if they want to consume Google services or not.   I personally find his fluctuation between dropping it and living in it fascinating, even though I'm firmly on the ""drop it"" side of things. I think many more will struggle with this choice as time presses on. The one question I would seriously ask /u/ChrisLAS is, do you think it is ethical to put your kid's lives into the machine? Shouldn't they have a choice of whether or not to submit that information to those companies (when they're at an age to reasonably make that decision)?"

My (perhaps incorrect) perception is that the pace has picked up on btrfs development recently. That's good because it gives us hope that some long-standing issues might eventually be addressed, but a little unnerving for the wider userbase who just want to plug & play/set-and-forget.  I've been meaning to get around to studying if I can contribute to the btrfs test-cases. I'm expecting to find room for improvement on testing device failure modes especially in multi-disk setups, some of the trauma on btrfs ML recently has left me thinking ""this seems testable"". I'm certainly cautious about deploying bleeding edge kernels, or any alternate kernels at all for that matter - I'm not sure I'd put btrfs on any business-critical task without having your own testing/validation in place: I don't think that btrfs is that mature yet."

LinuxActionShow,3at6tg,jmabbz,2,Tue Jun 23 13:46:18 2015 UTC,"Attempts to block piracy websites work only in as far as they may help to prevent ""casual piracy"" by those who can't tell Windows from Ubuntu.  It will do nothing to prevent anyone with an ounce of tech savvy from accessing those ""blocked"" sites. I guess this kind of gesture legislation appeases the lobbying organisations and ""appears"" to justify the resources they continually waste playing the futile game of 'whack a mole'. But, it sets a bad precedent in terms of internet censorship and can lead to many unforeseen consequences.   The foolishness of the belief that blocking such sites will prevent piracy is almost as fallacious as claiming the archaic and antiquated territorial media rights system is still fit for purpose in the globalised digital world.  If media companies sold people what they wanted, when they wanted it, at a reasonable price, then I'd suspect that the annual revenue ""lost"" though piracy (arguable - some studies suggest piracy actually increases total income, all told) may be less than they're currently spending on all these futile attempts to identify and close down ""infringing sites"", lobby governments to censor the internet, force ISPs to police their customers, and so on. The ""anti priacy"" lobbies of various countries appear to have evolved into industries of their own. Meanwhile, lawyers are making money ...  Instead of wasting time and resources chasing file-sharers around the planet, the content providers would, I'd argue, do far better to focus their energies on building fair and transparent global media rights and distribution systems that're fit for the 21st century."

You can see a similar story playing out as the grey-beards whine that ""Linux is this"", or ""Linux is that"", or ""systemd isnt Linux"".  Saying that Linux is more than Linus is uncontroversial. But you lot are acting as if Linus stepping away from Linux is tantamount to him going back in time to shoot his grandfather. That Linux would very slowly but persistently become more and more transparent in the polaroid picture Linus had in his pocket.  Its going to happen eventually, and I dont think there is any doubt that when it does, the way will be open for the talent currently wilting in the shade to grow sure and strong.

I'm not trying to gush over him, but he was the best man for the job, when the industry really needed someone to shake it up.

There is no reason to be ashamed if you use a derivative distro or does it really mean so much to people to say ""I run Arch.""?

Actually you'll find a great many of the more technical communities to be a little more aggressive about enforcing community standards as far as how the support forums can be (ab)used. The Arch community is downright cuddly compared to some... go ask a silly question that should've been answered by either reading docs or common sense on the OpenBSD mailing lists and see what sort of reception you get. And that's perfectly fine. The etiquette there is to not waste your fellow users time asking things you should've googled first.  Actually a lot of these communities will have clearly labelled posts laying out the ground rules and/or expectations up front. And a lot of the accusations of hostility come from people who flagrantly didn't bother to read such posts before diving in. And then they encounter people who've dealt with countless others who didn't bother to read the posted standards either and whose reserves of patience have been understandably strained... and then, well the predictable happens.

LinuxActionShow,3ar7uy,MichaelTunnell,3,Tue Jun 23 06:15:07 2015 UTC,"So I have two things to address about this post . . .    Arch Community is NOT as bad as people say.    There are assholes but that is true in every community. You would get annoyed too if you were supporting a project and users of a forked version of the project kept asking you for help. The frustration is reasonable and should be partially expected, yet they will still try to help even if there is hostility.  The main approach is to point out to them that Antergos is 100% compatible with Arch so it isn't a weird forked mess like all the rest so you are effectively using Arch with Antergos. Many people in the Arch community know this but just as many don't and just assume it is another garbage fork like Manjaro.     Why did you not ask for help from the Antergos community?   I just checked my logs, you entered the Antergos IRC once that I could see and waited only 30 minutes to get answers and at no point did you read the help wiki article that explains using the ""!help"" tag to get people's attention.  I am an OP in the Antergos IRC so I am always there but I am not always paying attention.  I am also a Mod for the Antergos Forum which you didn't seem to make a single post on.  If I was one of the people helping in Arch community and find out that you barely attempted to get help from the distro you are actually using I would immediately ignore you.    So in conclusion, your actions are exactly what frustrates the hell out of the Arch community by completely bypassing your own distro's support channels. I actually stopped supporting in #archlinux because I got sick of all the Manjaro people refusing to use their own support channels.    With all that said, Arch community is a lot more abrasive than most, except for maybe Gentoo and similar distros. I can completely understand your perception of the Arch community because it is kind of common but you have to also acknowledge that you aren't an innocent bystander in this, your actions resulted in the typical frustrated Arch fork mess.    Antergos' new approach of ""for Everyone"" actually frustrates me a LOT. As a long time Arch user and an Antergos user for over a year, I really like both but when someone comes to Antergos IRC and asks ""how do I install software with Antergos"" it gets REALLY frustrating."

Many people in the Arch community know this but just as many don't and just assume it is another garbage fork like Manjaro.     The Arch Linux community can't try to constantly keep track of all derivative distros and what they do, what their installer does and if that makes them close enough to Arch that they should get help from the parent distro community and if that is still true in the future. The only way to not let the forums turn in to a mess is to only provide support for Arch Linux, because then people know what to expect when someone asks for help."
LinuxActionShow,3ar7uy,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:57:39 2015 UTC,"My point was to explain that to attempt to avoid or minimize the hostility, not at all attempting to justify ignoring the official primary distro support channels.

LinuxActionShow,3ar7uy,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:30:33 2015 UTC,"Right let's get things straight. I am not not talking about people being asshole to ME about this issue, as I never asked for help on this, but while I have been on the irc I have witnessed backlash at OTHERS who come to ask help. The issues they ask about are not antergos issues and I notice no one is talking about the AUR helper debate which is what really annoyed me. To be told that AUR is shite and should not be used is a very elitist view is it not? Why can't we use tools to make life easier? ChrisLAS also pointed this out in his arch switch. I personally read all posts and bugs before using AUR packages and I know the perils. If it was really that bad why is it linked on the arch homepage?"
LinuxActionShow,3ar7uy,palasso,3,Tue Jun 23 06:55:20 2015 UTC,"Arch recognizes AUR as a good thing. I am not sure of the issue you are talking about. If there are people in the Arch community that have a problem with it then that doesn't mean that the Arch project has a problem with it. Why would they even create it in the first place if the project has a problem with it.  AUR is ""at own risk"". If someone is ok with accepting that responsibility then I say ""who cares"".  Auto-access to the AUR is dangerous because some people will not realize the potential issues created by it, that is why I hate Manjaro. This is also why I like Antergos because it warns you multiple times if you select the AUR."
LinuxActionShow,3ar7uy,sam_vde,5,Tue Jun 23 08:19:15 2015 UTC,"I am on #archlinux and I can say that arch users there are very welcome and help a lot, provided the person who's asking the question has done his homework.  Arch is not only software run in your computer, it's also a community with a mentality. Part of that mentality is to Read The Fine Wiki. It is expected for arch users to study and try things out themselves before asking for help. When you ask for help you're asking from someone else to devote time to your problem for free. In return he asks that you firstly devoted time for your own problem before asking for help.  You say that you want to learn but at the same time you don't have the time to do it. Maybe arch isn't for you then, until you find the required time to learn it.  Also since you're using Antergos and never used or installed arch and probably didn't delve into the documentation enough, you're expected to go to the Antergos support channels, not because Antergos software is very far away from Arch, but because Antergos mentality is very far away from Arch."

Sometimes I do have a lot of juniors coming to my desk (not for Linux problems) so much so that I can't focus on my own work....then I write a document while explaining stuff to someone. Next time someone else comes to me for same problem, I expect them to read the document I finished. If that doesn't solve issue, then I might be available. I feel it saves a lot of time for me. In that sense I can see both sides of argument.  I am not sure of the hostility angle though. Perhaps sometimes techie people do not have social touch.

LinuxActionShow,3ar7uy,blackout24,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:30:56 2015 UTC,"Hullo!  In my experience, the #archlinux IRC channel tends to run a bit lower level / terse in its responses.  Not that people are mean or elitist as I've still gotten great help on that channel, just be prepared to go into more depth with questions other than ""how do I do x"".  I usually do ""I'm trying to do X, I've already tried A, B, and C and got these results and I've ready about topics Y and Z on the wiki already.  Anyone have recommendation for me to try next?"" and it usually gives the people there an idea on how best to help my specific problem.  Seems to get a lot better reception when people know you are putting in effort yourself and are not just a help vampire.    For a more newbie friendly place to go for Arch-related help, in both topics and general interfacing w/ the people, try #archlinux-newbie.  Also, as mentioned by theredbaron1834, the Arch Linux subreddit is also a generally good place to go for help.  I pitch in there a once or twice a week to try and help answer questions as I come across ones that I can answer and I don't recall much elitism there.  Stop by and give us a post some time.  :)  As far as Arch stability and having to fix broken system, I ran Manjaro for about 8 months before moving to straight Arch, which I've been using for the past 6 months or so and I have not had my system broken by updates not once.  I usually update by desktop daily and my laptop 1-2 a week.  I use MATE for my DE.  I use aarchup to give me pop up notifications when updates are available (also works w/ AUR packages).  If there are no kernel/GPU driver/DE updates in the list, I run the updates right there.  If there are, I'll drop by the Arch subreddit and the Arch homepage to check for any news of stuff breaking before running the updates.  YMMV, but this is what I do and it's worked very well for me.  If you are worried about having to re-install (HDD dried, system too mucked up, etc), I would recommend either using an installer (Antergos or maybe EvoLution) in conjunction with good backups (should have those regardless of OS) or using a custom install script.  I wrote my own install wrapper that automates 95% of my install.  For an install, I boot up arch live iso, wget the scripts from my gitlab server, run the installer, reboot, run the firstboot script, make sure applicable GPU driver is installed, and reboot.  I get a system that has my DE setup, mostly pre-configured with my preferred theme, colors, etc and with all the packages I want to use.  Then I just restore from a backup and that takes care of the vast majority of my needs.  I recently had to do a re-install of my system due to a failed HDD and it was very painless using the above method and the longest part of the process was just copying my files to the new hard drive.    Not saying you have to make your install wrapper by any means (though the option to make a super personalized flavor of Arch for yourself with just a couple bash scripts is fun and satisfying!) but the option exists and is great piece of mind when doing re-installs that the end result with be the same.  You could also easily pair a post install script with Antergos for the same effect.  Just some ideas and thoughts to hopefully speed you on your way when things come up!  One of the things I love about Arch is the vast amount of customization available, both in using the system as well as meta in that you can leave a lot of stuff to automation (like using Antergos for install and Pamac for installing/browsing software) or if you have the time/inclination you can get your hands into the guts of the system.  Both are perfectly valid and I hate that a vocal minority in the Arch community put of an elitist air.  There are a ton of nice and helpful people in the community, sometimes you just gotta wade through the butts to find them (same with practically all communities of humans lol)."
LinuxActionShow,3ar7uy,palasso,0,Tue Jun 23 08:29:15 2015 UTC,Now I am a big Arch Fan Boy its the main reason I can actually stick with Linux in my daily life.  My only problem with your rant is its not just the Arch Community that is like this its the whole linux echo system.  Their are a lot of views that see things that simplify the linux experience to be scary.  Cough Cough systemd... even if its for the better of the whole community even if they wont agree with it.   You really just need to find the right community of people to talk to.  PS when ever I had antergeros problem and I needed to talk to the arch community I never admit I am an antergeros because a majority of antergeros problems are all of arch's problems ;)

But it bugged me that Chris said more than once that Red Hat's stock recently hit an all-time high.  That is simply not true. The stock recently hit a 15-year high, but it is still quite a bit below its all-time high.    How quickly we forget the tech bubble.  Red Hat reached an all-time intraday high of of $151 on December 8, 1999. Its highest closing value was $143.50 on the previous day.  The current price is about $80.  All prices are split-adjusted, so they can be compared directly. If the stock doubles from here, as some expect, it will reach an all-time high.  But that hasn't happened yet."

LinuxActionShow,3amatc,jan_someknot,0,Sun Jun 21 22:33:25 2015 UTC,"I posted that review, because that is my expierience with Fedora, too. Why did i not write it in my own words? Well, Igor Ljubuncic (dedoimedo.com) is just a stable.  But i can refine my posts, i guess: Fedora feels to me like unfinished und not made for people. Just like a testbed to get REL going. So many little bugs in my install, even getting the box ""ready"" for multimedia is ""work"". Why would i go though that, if there are so many ""good"" painfree Distros out there.  I do belive Rad Hat is a great company, but i also belive Fedora is not a good Distro ""for everyone""."
LinuxActionShow,3amatc,jb_19,2,Sun Jun 21 20:43:36 2015 UTC,"Fedora feels to me like unfinished und not made for people.    Were you using fedora or the kde spin?  Fedora, the gnome-shell version, is about as seamless a system, and experience, as you're going to get out of the box with gnome-shell.      So many little bugs in my install,    I'm sorry but I don't recall many 'little' bugs from that review.  He wasn't interested in the slides, and he had an issue with uefi which was resolved by a reboot.  Also, there was an issue with his graphic driver I think... that's a far cry from many.  If anything it's 1 minor annoyance, and 1 issue that should be looked into if it continues to be a problem.  Did that mirror your experiences?  What else went wrong?  You can let the devs know if something is broken so they can fix it (they can't fix it if they don't know it's broken!).  This is a vital part of making a distribution easy to use... people have to let the team know when something's broken and not just complain on a random blog.   getting the box ""ready"" for multimedia is ""work"".   There are legal reasons for this, but I'd  hardly call following steps 1-3 here work.   Why would i go though that, if there are so many ""good"" painfree Distros out there.   Then don't?  I think it's pretty well known who fedora is aimed at and if you want a distribution that just does everything for you then go ahead and stick with one that does that.  I'm not going to complain that Arch took too much effort to install (I'd be rightfully laughed at) or any criticism ignoring the distribution landscape.    Are you any of the below:    a developer? a sysadmin working with RHEL or CentOS? working on the gnome project or systemd? working on the kernel? interested in experiencing the latest refined gnome-shell experience? interested in what RHEL is going to look like down the road? looking for an alternative to Arch or Suse? experienced with Linux to the point you are comfortable on the command line and troubleshooting issues? interested in learning more about SELinux?   If none of those describe you then you may want to reconsider using fedora as your main distribution.  This is the beauty of Linux... if this doesn't suit your needs then it's very likely that somewhere another one will!  You want everything installed by default?  Use Sabayon; I used it for a while and it's a great distribution!  The downside was that updates took a long long time that first time you used it... and you should probably be a little comfortable with the underpinnings of the system if something should break.    Just like a testbed to get REL going.    This is not at all the case.  The Fedora team does their own thing and this is a bit insulting to all the hardworking developers with Fedora, and I'm not one of them, trying to make a great distribution.   If you don't want to use fedora then I'm not going to begrudge you for it.  That's the beauty of Linux.  Find a distribution that works for you and use it.  I've gone through many before finally settling with fedora and that includes Ubuntu, debian, spins of Ubuntu and debian, Arch, spins of Arch, Gentoo, spins of Gentoo, etc... and now I'm here.  I'm not saying that it's perfect.  I'm not saying it's better than any of the others, just better for me.  The part of that review, and your comment, that really bothered me is the claim that it's just a testbed and it's not suited for use by people.  This is very very far from the truth.  It's not meant for all people, but that's not the intent.

And i was refering to my install, when i said ""many little errors"" ~ i fixed almost all of them, like i said, i used it. Then went ahead and used rpmfusion. All useable, but far from good. I ran into the same ""hassle"" with nvidia (nvs 300) as Igor Ljubuncic for example. But, i responded to address another thing you said ~   Fedora for: a developer? ==> Developer on Fedora? No other distro will suit? a sysadmin working with RHEL or CentOS? ==> Good point!  working on the gnome project or systemd? ==> Almost 80-85% of all major distros got systemD now; gnome is common, too.. working on the kernel? ==> Sry, what?

Why? interested in experiencing the latest refined gnome-shell experience? ==> That would be Arch, sry. interested in what RHEL is going to look like down the road? ==> Then Fedora is a good choice! looking for an alternative to Arch or Suse? ==> Fedora is not alternative to Arch. Strange comparision. But Suse is a good one. experienced with Linux to the point you are comfortable on the command line and troubleshooting issues? ==> Haha, yes, then you should use Fedora - i give you that. interested in learning more about SELinux? ==> Fair enough.  I'd like to end with some words from the https://getfedora.org/ HP: ""Less setup, more innovation."" - Yeah, sure, Fedora.

I understand how that can be frustrating but this is a complaint you should be leveraging at NVidia, not fedora.  Fedora used open source and free software by default.  I don't use the closed source nvidia drivers and my experience differs from yours.  Is it perfect? No, but it's far from being unusable - in fact for me it's fine.    Fedora for: .....   I think you missed what I was saying.  I'm not saying that you have to use fedora if you want to do any of those things.  I'm saying that it's more than adequate to fulfill your needs if you are doing those things (or better put it's well suited for those tasks).  You can do pretty much everything there from whatever distribution you choose.  That's sort of the point of open-source.   ""Less setup, more innovation.""    See: docker integration/project atomic/cockpit, systemd, dnf, wayland, etc... My point here is that it's arguable that fedora and Red Hat are sort of leading the charge with innovation and simplifying many tasks, though those tasks just may not be something that you see or are directly impacted by.  I'm not here to convince you to use fedora.  I'm not here to convince you to do anything other than keep an open mind.  Like I said, if you want to use another distribution I'm the last person who will fault you for it.  I fully recognize that not every distribution is ideally suited for every user.  Some distributions are better suited for different purposes.  Fedora is best suited as a workstation (it's even in the description).  You can use it as your everyday machine if you want but it would likely be easier to use something else if your end goal isn't work/productivity."
LinuxActionShow,3amatc,abhurtel,0,Sun Jun 21 22:29:42 2015 UTC,"Good job explaining jb_19. I totally agree with your point. Fedora 22 is a great distribution and it is my  OS of choice. I just arch on my second laptop(don't want to start new distro war on reddit ). Arch is rolling and some people don't like that rolling (even though something hardly breaks on Arch Linux and breaks are fixed promptly by awesome community). I use fedora since it is easy for installation and I can get what is coming in red hat. Fedora is great since it can be used to follow some awesome projects such as wayland, systemd and so on. I don't use Ubuntu since it is at first going to use MIR display server and kernel is not updated frequently. Some packages such as eclipse are not updated when I was on school and decided to use Arch and then Fedora on my laptop. I can obviously updated kernel and eclipse on Ubuntu. But that is not my point  The article is biased and we should not make a big deal out of this (“Linux folks like to change things for the sake of change”). We like to change because the newer version in this case is better(talking about dnf).  Whoever wrote that article has no idea what is he saying. Look the jupiterbroadcasting.com latest review (more like overview of Redhat) and listen the kind of open source energy they have. Also in Linux action show, some guy from red hat encourage people to use any distribution they like such as  Arch, Ubuntu, OpenSuse or fedora. We should listen and follow advice from people who have some experience (such as ChrisLAS, KernelLinux..few people I can think right now) but not from some random guy who uses Microsoft Window and have no idea what he is talking.  Being a Linux user (Arch Linux, Fedora or OpenSuse) means we are ready to explore and report any bugs and encourage people towards open source and Libre software. This does not mean we are fighting for some silly thing. If you really want rock solid distro, you can still buy RHEL and install on your laptop(wait you are cheap, you don't want to buy and want only free thing). These things are free (Libre) and developed by awesome community and still we quarrel. If we have any problem, we should open a bug report and discuss on mailing list. Sometimes it is easier if you think this based on developer perspective rather than what works for you. Plus we can always tweak if know how (not like old old guy from that article who is using Linux since her granddaughter told her).   I really praise GNU and all Linux distro,developers testers and users. Some people use mac and window and they install Linux for writing review. They will never understand Linux unless you use it. Things breaks, you fix them and then you will understand its power(actually you feel good). I have changed some window users to Linux. At first they are not very happy. Help them for few weeks and explain how some stuff works in Linux (show some command line tricks). Once they get the feel of Linux and its power, they will then totally understand the power of Linux.   I don’t mean to offend anyone (just the way I think).

Use a good set of firewall rules (close all unused ports and don't let unsolicited traffic enter in)  For the paranoids who might object to the claim that antivirus is not necessary --- the line of thinking is that there is nothing on earth that will stop from any virus anyways."

LinuxActionShow,3ahh5d,livestradamus,2,Sun Jun 21 08:52:06 2015 UTC,"You don't have to update every release. Each release is supported for 13 months after the newest release.  We say maintained for approximately 13 months because the supported period for releases is dependent on the date the release under development goes final. As a result, Release X is supported until one month after the release of Release X+2.  This translates into:  Fedora 21 will be maintained until 1 month after the release of Fedora 23. Fedora 22 will be maintained until 1 month after the release of Fedora 24.    Maintenance Schedule Rationale  Fedora is focused on free and open source software innovations and moves quickly. If you want a distribution that moves slower but has a longer lifecycle, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which is derivative of Fedora or free rebuilds of that such as CentOS might be more suitable for you. Refer to the RHEL page for more details.  Historically, the Fedora Project has found supporting two releases plus Rawhide and the pre-release Branched code to be a manageable work load."

Rawhide is what you want if you want the newest of the new but as we all know, there will be bugs and problems.  I'm just waiting to see what they replace Fedup with. It is sort of ok now, as it stands. I used it to go from F21 to F22 and there are no problems.

LinuxActionShow,3ahh5d,livestradamus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:25:50 2015 UTC,"I think if Arch didn't exist, I would probably run Fedora on all my machines.  What keeps me from using Fedora is primarily that be it 6 months or 2 years or whatever, I eventually have to do an upgrade to prevent from using outdated software.  When I was new to Linux, it was exciting doing an upgrade/re-install when new versions of a Fedora or Ubuntu or Debian came out.  The hassle of doing that quickly wore off.  These days, I don't want to have to re-install or perform a big upgrade to get the latest version of Chrome that can play Netflix natively or the latest update of the best DE ever, MATE (may be subjective xD) and so on.  With Arch, I get to upgrade bits and pieces of my software here and there and if something breaks (have yet to have that happen in over a year), I have a small list of packages to look at and not an entire system's worth of packages to troubleshoot.  Yes, this is not a common thing to deal with since one only would need to do a big upgrade every 6 months to 1-2 years, but it's still a thing.   I really, really want Fedora to work for me.  It was my first Linux install ever, it's what I first learned Linux on, and will always hold a special place in my geek heart.  But over the last 10+ releases, it has never felt quite finished baking.  It always feels sooooo close to being done, like a cake taken out of the oven a couple minutes too early.

Unity forks lots of mainstream libraries thanks to Canonical's Not-Invented-Here syndrome. These are often changed in undocumented ways. Attempting to get Unity running on another desktop can involve a significant effort to find all of these other libraries and try to get them running without breaking existing software (again, because Canonical tends not to make clear what they're changed). OpenSUSE finally gave up.  That's the point: other distros work for the betterment of all of Linux. Canonical works for the betterment of Canonical. When OpenSUSE got Google Summer of Code credits, they used some of them to take a library they had that could produce interfaces for GTK, Qt and NCurses and strip out the OpenSUSE-specific dependencies so others could use the library too. That's called being a good neighbor. See the difference between them and Canonical? Canonical didn't lift a finger to help OpenSUSE get Unity running, because you know that's the way they wanted it.  When Canonical got Ubuntu running on ARM they... got Ubuntu running on ARM. No help to anyone else. When other distros began trying, OpenSUSE patched QEMU to improve ARM emulation; Arch used the OpenSUSE patches to get work done on some major libraries; OpenSUSE used those Arch-patched libraries, etc. The other distros worked together, Canonical did not.  OpenSUSE made the theme of one of their summits ""collaboration across borders"" and invited other distros (including Ubuntu) to come and discuss how they could work together. Canonical made the Ubuntu software center. Part of this collaboration meeting talked about a universal format so that all software stores could interoperate and make it easier for developers to submit their software to all of them in one step.   OpenSUSE took its ""OpenSUSE Build Service"" and turned it into ""Open Build Service"" and invited other distros to use it. Their ""snapper"" program for Btrfs snapshots runs on other distros. Canonical is legendary for not submitting patches upstream. I remember when I first started using desktop linux KDE didn't have an option to disconnect from a WiFi network - you could turn off the WiFi or switch to a new network, but not just disconnect. I searched Google and found a discussion at the Ubuntu forum. Someone had filed a bug and Canonical had developed a patch and... patched their own repository's file. I remember thinking, ""That's great for Ubuntu users, but what about the rest of us?"" It was only later that I learned that that's not how open source is supposed to work but it's how Canonical works too often.  So don't pin anything on me. Canonical does not work in the interests of advancing the Linux community, only its own. If Fedora/Red Hat disappeared tomorrow, we'd lose a massive amount of contributions both on server and desktop Linux. If IBM disappeared we'd lose a significant amount of kernel contributions. If SUSE disappeared we'd lose a significant amount of contributions to LibreOffice. If Canonical disappeared - think about it. Nothing would happen. The *buntu clones would rebase off of Debian and the Linux world would go on as if nothing had happened. Now imagine if we lost Debian!   Please don't try to tell me that when Ubuntu makes advancements we all win. When Ubuntu makes advancements the advancements either stay in the Ubuntu repos or they're intentionally based on obscure, undocumented Canonical forks of mainstream libraries so that it's hard to impossible to port the code to another distro."
LinuxActionShow,3adwyd,alcalde,2,Sat Jun 20 06:03:05 2015 UTC,"When Ubuntu makes advancements, we call win. It's FOSS. They don't have to try extra hard to make it easier for people to use their code. The license defines FOSS, not some sort of special relationship between distros.   I'm fine with what Canonical does, I don't really give a rat's ass if people don't like how they conduct their own business. They spend their own money, their own time and write software which is free to use or modify. It's FOSS, everybody wins. If the documentation isn't up to snuff, if they don't contribute upstream, boo fucking hoo. That's not in the license."
LinuxActionShow,3adwyd,sudo-intellectual,0,Thu Jun 25 03:50:52 2015 UTC,"When Ubuntu makes advancements, we call win.   Who's ""we""? Canonical?    It's FOSS.   When it's obfuscated such that others can't easily build on your work, it's not FOSS.   They don't have to try extra hard to make it easier for people to use their  code.    Yes, yes they do. That's the whole idea behind it... sharing. Standing on the shoulders of giants. Not lifting a finger to help anyone else or worse, intentionally obfuscating your software, violates the principle if not the letter of the open source license.  They might not legally have to, but then they get the hate that OP complained about. You can't have it both ways. You can't mistreat the community and then object when others call you out on it.   The license defines FOSS, not some sort of special relationship between  distros.   Well, so much for the notion of ""community"" then.... It seems other distros do indeed have a sort of special relationship in that they realize we're all in this together and help each other. Trying to go it alone while simultaneously basing your business on the back of Debian (and other) contributors is inherently unfair.  Embarcadero (current owners of the Delphi proprietary language/IDE) released a new mobile framework a few years ago. A very compatible open source product, FreePascal, had already added ARM support years earlier. Apparently not having their own new compiler ready in time for release, they actually bundled FreePascal's compiler with their software. They had had nothing to do with the FreePascal project at any time. They never notified the FPC people, asked, or contributed one line of code back or one dollar in donations (Delphi is VERY expensive). When people complained about this, they defended it in terms of complying with the license, as if that was all that mattered.  Meanwhile, not too long afterwards, when they had their own ARM compiler, they purchased a company that produced a database library for both Delphi and FreePascal. They promptly cancelled FreePascal support. The first words by the product manager when folks complained was (in regards to FreePascal) ""They're a competitor...."" They're a competitor, but they had no problems using their compiler for free because the license let them. Is this a company that truly understands the nature of open source? And if not, is Canonical?   I'm fine with what Canonical does, I don't really give a rat's ass if people  don't like how they conduct their own business. They spend their own  money, their own time and write software which is free to use or modify.   It's not free to modify if they make it hard to impossible for others to modify. And if you don't care about that, you don't care about the whole point of open source. If I made changes to open source code and then put the changes on a 1 bit/s server or only provided it in printed form and said I was technically complying with the license, would that be fine too?   It's FOSS, everybody wins.    They don't win by default, which is the argument you repeatedly ignore. VMWare is using a stub to circumvent the GPL (currently the subject of a lawsuit). Is everyone winning there?   If the documentation isn't up to snuff, if they don't contribute upstream, boo  fucking hoo. That's not in the license.   You don't get the first thing about open source, and apparently do you not get the first thing about what a community is or how to be a good player in it. You'd make a good Embarcadero PR person though. :-("

The only reason he'd be emigrating there would be as a tax dodge in the first place:   The Isle of Man is a low-tax economy with no capital gains tax, wealth tax,  stamp duty, or inheritance tax and a top rate of income tax of 20%. A tax  cap is in force; the maximum amount of tax payable by an individual is  £115,000 or £230,000 for couples if they choose to have their incomes  jointly assessed. The £115,000 tax cap equates to an assessable income  of £589,550. Personal income is assessed and taxed on a total worldwide  income basis rather than a remittance basis. This means that all income  earned throughout the world is assessable for Manx tax rather than only  income earned in or brought into the Island.  The rate of corporation tax is 0% for almost all types of income; the only  exceptions are that the profits of banks are taxed at 10%, as is rental (or  other) income from land and buildings situated on the Isle of Man.   In this case, I don't feel sorry for him and it makes the intent of the South African law a bit more clear.   I can't find out where Canonical is actually incorporated, but one of the places it does have offices is on the Isle Of Man."

The Librem 13 claims 6-8 hours, I'll gladly believe 6 hours as that seems to be pretty standard for a lot in this size range.  Now, even if we bump the cpu model from the 1.6Ghz to 2.2Ghz option that's only $150 and puts it at $1,149.00. Still $350 cheaper, and being so while containing containing a 128GB SSD.

Macbook Pro Retina 13: Starting at $1,299.00 ( Stock )  2.7GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 Turbo Boost up to 3.1GHz 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 memory 128GB PCIe-based flash storage1 Intel Iris Graphics 6100 Built-in battery (10 hours)2 Force Touch trackpad   Now, to start we still have a better battery.

The Carbon comes with a hefty tax that blows both the Apple and the Librem away. The XPS13 is slightly better priced but has an awkward camera placement ( don't know what they were thinking with that ).  And if this thing is $1,500 USD...

Some big company controls 75% of the world consumer credit market (stupid), and destroying it will mean that people who borrowed money wouldnt have to pay it back (stupid). No consideration for all those people who loaned the big company the money and who would lose everything. Those pension funds that would be crippled. Lets forget about the fact that it would destroy the consumer credit market meaning that people who wanted to buy something but didnt have the cash would just have to give up on the purchase or go to a local lender and pay much higher interest. Lets ignore all that.  For as much as the show credits the viewer with intelligence by being somewhat technically honest (hackers using terminals instead of videogame UI), it treats the viewers as complete retards by building such a clownish villain.

My two test cases in DDG for this issue are now much improved:   obnam mount   (Used to return a bunch of totally wrong results about ""Mount Obama"", but now is correctly giving me results about how to mount Obnam (OSS backup software) repos.   vultr review   Used to return a bunch of junk results about ""vulture"", and even ""vault"", instead of the VPS provider ""Vultr"". Now they're all mostly relevant.  What have your experiences been with DDG's indexing speed? For me this is still the major shortcoming. For example, today I searched for information about the new Librem 13 laptop, and it only returned results about the Librem 15. (Admittedly, Google's results weren't very good for this query either, but at least the 3rd results was for puri.sm/librem-13).  Another minor annoyance is when searching for bugs by their number. DDG still doesn't find bugs by their number, whereas Google does. Compare:   https://duckduckgo.com/?q=kde+bug+320059 https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=kde%20bug%20321060"

Weld some cross braces along the back for rigidity and then hook your back pads on to that. Build arms out of more tubing and mount pads on baseboards with adjustable clamps. For customisation you can drill holes in the frame at equal length and fix the arms with a through bold that can be moved to change the height of the arms.  Aside from finding some nice cushion pads which for my money should not be leather as I find leather skins capture moisture and heat very easily causing it to stretch and sag over time.

Longer version: Have you ever read something and get the feeling that the author is just very biased one way or the other?  That's exactly how I felt reading this piece.  It's not informative in the least and it's almost like he's whining throughout the experience.  Sure he suffered some setbacks, some of which are misattributed, but when you opt to go for a desktop version that's not the main one you can't really judge the whole project on one underwhelming experience that isn't actually the focus.  What kind of complaints are    I didn't like the slideshow [during installation]    and    I had to enter my wireless password again [after installing]?     Also, complaining about notifications in KDE seems to be missing the point.  Then there was this gem, which irked me a little more than it should have:    Then, to make things worse, yum is no longer your package management of choice, because Linux folks like to change things for the sake of change.   Finally he decides to download easylife and places the blame on fedora for not updating all the packages he got via easylife?  Something seems off with this review.  This conclusion is just terrible:   And so, without any application testing, any customization, desktop effects, resource usage testing, and some other bits and pieces, we must bring the Fedora Twenty-Two KDE review to a halt. Because the distro is dead, and it can't cope with some simple updates and installs. Really a shame. It reminds me that Fedora is a testbed.   Don't waste your time reading it..."
LinuxActionShow,3a1wdm,jb_19,3,Wed Jun 17 00:21:38 2015 UTC,"While I agree that the review is biased, but then again, most reviews are. You may not know this, but dedoimedo is a kernel developer and debugger for a major tech company, plus a red hat enthusiast, but his reviews focus on a casual user. That is, he performs tasks and tests mimicking what would do or think a non-advanced linux user. hence his trange and unusual approach to testing (slideshow, visual glitches, easylife etc)  As for Your points: * he did not write he didnt like the slideshow, only that it was not impressive. If You use block quotes its better to actually quote the article rather than put Your own words. * If you connected to wireless once during installation, it should be obvious that you dont need to do it again after install. its obvious to ubuntu users, hence his comment. * regardless whether gnome is the main focus or not. KDE is an official spin available at fedora website. Does that mean that only fedora gnome is a working distribution and we should stay away from spins? does fedora = gnome?"
LinuxActionShow,3a1wdm,Tireseas,2,Wed Jun 17 07:58:27 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, Especially with that last point. If it's going to be included as an official spin, or hell even in the main repositories, it reflects on the distro itself and should be expected to work."
LinuxActionShow,3a1wdm,sb56637,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:38:26 2015 UTC,"In addition, he actually used to have Fedora in his best distros of the year category. He's actually quite unbiased as far as reviewers go, he just doesn't tolerate bugs and really docks points when a distro requires a lot of manual configuration to get important functions working.   his reviews focus on a casual user. That is, he performs tasks and tests mimicking what would do or think a non-advanced linux user.   I think that more Linux/OSS devs should try to do this. I think they often forget how much more extremely advanced they are than the vast majority of their target audience. In my case, I am capable of Googling around to get my graphics working, or mucking around in a terminal to troubleshoot, but I sure do prefer distros that don't require me to do so."
LinuxActionShow,3a1wdm,jb_19,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:43:43 2015 UTC,"You are right, I should have had exact quotes for the first two or three complaints.  My issue is that his complaints were rather inconsequential, when they were the fault of fedora at least.  Not liking, or finding interesting, the slides during install might be one of the dumbest complaints I've ever heard. Find me an installer that has interesting slides which actually significantly impact the install process.    Sure, having to enter your password twice is mildly inconvenient but let's not make it a bigger deal than it actually is.  It's not like it never ever remembers after install.  It's literally a one time issue.  Honestly, my issue isn't the problems he had with KDE, because they seemed relatively minor, but considering they are switching to gnome software center I think it's probably wise to consider the gnome variant as the standard, not the spins.  Does that mean never use them? Not at all, but be prepared for things to not always work perfectly.  When I spun up gnomebuntu did I declare that Ubuntu was just a testing ground because I ran into a few minor issues?    My issue with his review is that it is half baked.  At no point did he mention that the fault of the failed updates was probably the fault of the other thing he added nor did he mention the other issues to be KDE specific.  If his review if geared towards casual users then they will most likely use the gnome, default, variant.  Why not do that review instead?  Why not put in a little effort to show that codecs are actually easy to install?  With all of this done poor person is going to read this post and think he's actually right... That fedora is somehow a second class distribution.  It's certainly not for everyone but it's not nearly as bad as he makes it out to be.  If he made a different conclusion then my attitude towards the article would be completely different.  As it stands it comes across as some new user quickly looked a couple things up on the internet that he heard about and wrote a review of his experience and failure of trying to implement it.  If he wants lazy stick with Ubuntu or Sabayon.  Don't review fedora, which is targeted at developers and other computer literate users, add though it's going to be a lazy person's distribution."
LinuxActionShow,3a1wdm,jb_19,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:54:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of Your points and disagree with others - I will not address them, let's not argue further over this. There are better things to do :). Also, I hold no grudge against fedora or red hat. I never used fedora myself, I had a brief romance with centos and I thinks its a powerful but difficult piece of a distro.   So my parting thought is this - wireless, easylife, slideshow are all minor things and we both agree with this. It is clear to me however, that the main reasons as to why The author scored fedora so low, were inability to boot from a newer uefi supported hardware, screen tearing and glitches, firefox sluggishness with hardware acceleration, and finally, unbootable system after an update and nvidia drivers installation."
LinuxActionShow,3a1wdm,commandline1984,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:33:33 2015 UTC,"I think we agree on the major points but I guess I just viewed it as lazy reporting.  Yeah the screen tearing and other assorted issues are problems that should be fixed.  I think the one thing that stood out for me was your last one: the system not booting after the updates.  In the interest of clarity, and I'm not debating or flaming or anything here, the reason I don't blame fedora for that is it's not in the fedora repositories.  The tool he added is most likely to blame there so my thought is that it's akin to something like Steam breaking your system - you blame Steam not your OS.    CentOS is a great distribution for getting work done but it's not great for your average desktop.  If you are a sys admin or developer or otherwise require stability above all else then this, in my opinion, is the best distribution for you.  If you have a system with Intel graphics and your hardware is compatible with open source drivers then I suggest you at least try out the live CD.  It's actually become a pretty great distribution and I've switched most all of my machines over to either fedora or centos, with 2 exceptions required by my wife which are running Ubuntu and gnomebuntu.  Don't let this piece scare you off from trying it.  DNF is actually kind of awesome in that it downloads updates in parallel and the gnome implementation is pretty slick. One other neat thing with dnf is that if you try to run something from the command line and its not installed it will ask if you want to install it. I made the switch when 20 came out and it just keeps getting better, though that's mostly because gnome shell is getting better by leaps and bounds.  If you hate gnome shell, need proprietary stuff, or aren't comfortable with learning a couple new tools and methods then stay away.  Fedora is just far enough back from bleeding edge that there are seldom any issues that break the system but it's far enough upstream that you get to enjoy all the newest freshness."

I'm happy with it so far - very nice distro - thank you Antergos team!  I did however experience an issue when installing onto a new Samsung 840 EVO SSD that I'd put in a Lenovo Z50, where the install would constantly fail.   The solution was to update cnchi when booted into the live CD (pacman -Syu cnchi).  The live CD (put on a USB stick) was a freshly downloaded, and reported that it was the newest version when booted. But a version query showed it was actually a few updates behind the latest release (I don't remember exactly how many).   So it seems that there is/was an issue with the live CD not correctly querying the cnchi version (and not coming with the latest version to begin with - it was an ISO downloaded directly from antergos.com).  Once cnchi had been updated, it installed without any further issues. So if anyone else has any problems during installation, it might be worth giving that a try, just to be sure it is actually running the latest version of the installer."

LinuxActionShow,39va74,ChrisLAS,2,Mon Jun 15 15:54:24 2015 UTC,So why this effort over something like the RSS feed and a podcatcher?
LinuxActionShow,39va74,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:01:03 2015 UTC,"I have it for more than just podcasts. I use it for almost all youtube videos that I watch.  There are many reasons for using this setup:   No dependence on Flash, whether I have it installed or not does not affect me. Native Video Player so the performance is unmatched Sane Media Navigation, Youtube's navigation shortcuts are awful but with MPV I can use all of the features of MPV to easily navigate the media. No Bullshit Buffering - watching it in MPV via youtube-dl allows me to bypass Google/Youtube's stupid buffering garbage. MPV allows for multiple videos to play simultaneously if I want. (I actually did this a few days ago because two youtube channels did a ""sync'd video"") I can pause the video and never lose my place or what I've already buffered. Youtube forces rebuffers after an arbitrary amount of time paused. VLC is just absolute trash when it comes to pausing streams. Only download when I want it, no wasted storage. Bonus Feature - pretty much no ads at all. I don't mind ads actually but the prerolls can't play when doing this.   I do actually have RSS Feeds of the podcasts I consume (via Tiny Tiny RSS) but I do not want a podcatcher because automatically downloading content is not useful as I do not listen to every episode of every podcast I am subscribed to. I would have to delete the episodes I don't want.  I also like to listen to some podcasts on my phone while I do chores, errands, or something while others I prefer to watch them on my laptop or desktop.   why this effort   It isn't that much effort actually. I install 2 applications, mpv and youtube-dl, then I install 1 Firefox addon, FlashGot. Finally, I create an entry for MPV in FlashGot and I'm done.  MPV has default input for youtube-dl now so there is no need to use extra CLI options thus I really only have to create one thing myself to make this work."
LinuxActionShow,39va74,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:36:15 2015 UTC,I should probably make a tutorial for this since I have been doing it for years and have not told many people about it lol. Selfish a bit maybe.

Everyone doing it means countermeasures and/or The Google trying like hell to make you use Chrome   That is probably true.   Usually, I just throw the YouTube link at VLC...as of late I'm experiencing a bug with it, sound, and seeking though.   I actually can't stand VLC...I am one of the few people on the planet that will not use VLC unless absolutely necessary.  VLC's media navigation shortcuts are stupid and require adjustments for me. VLC also has the worst streaming support I have seen on linux video players. MPV is great but even Totem destroys VLC in this aspect.  Media Navigation: Skipping forward in video should be different amounts of time as skipping back. MPV and Totem do this correctly by like Forward 5 Minutes then Back 2 Minutes. (not default, just an example)   VLC makes forward and backward the same amount of time which means skipping via shortcuts is impractical and pointless. VLC ALWAYS introduces artifacts when you skip through streamed videos. VLC will constantly crash for me when trying to stream video, whether that be via Youtube, Direct URLs, or RSTP/RTMP streams of JBLive.tv   MPV gets it right in all of those aspects. MPV is not perfect but for powerusers it is by far the best."

LinuxActionShow,39vczp,Ironicbadger,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:08:20 2015 UTC,"Generating a GPG keypair  Alright, first we are going to create a gpg key. Fire up a terminal and run   gpg --full-gen-key   You'll be asked to select a type of key. Go ahead and stick with the default RSA and RSA  Next, it will ask you what size of key. Normally I'd tell you to go for the strongest available (4096 bit) but the YubiKey only supports up to 2048 so stick with the default here too.   Then, it will ask toy to select an expiry date. It is tempting to set your key to never exprie or set it to expire in like 10 years but I'd recommend keeping the time short. If you lose access to your private key, you don't want something that represents your identity floating around on the internet, inaccessible. I usually set it for one year. When my year is almost up, i just set the key to expire in another year.  The rest of the prompt is pretty straight forward. Just follow the instructions. Set a strong password for the key.  Generating the required subkeys  Now that it's generated, we have to edit it and generate the subkeys that we are going to put on the YubiKey.   Run gpg --expert --edit-key NAME where name can either be the name or email you supplied when you generated the key  Now the Yubikey is capable of holding three subkeys. A signing key (one that you can use to sign emails/files so that others can ensure that they actually came from you), an encryption key (a key that is capable of encrypting files) and an authentication key (the one we will be using to show that you are who you say you are to your servers).  NOTE: Subkeys can have any or all of the aforementioned abilities. E.g. you could have a subkey capable of encryption, signing and authentication but I wouldn't recommend it.  By default a subkey capable of encryption is generated when you generated the key. We are going to create another that is only capable of authentication:  After you ran the gpg --expert --edit-key NAME command you should be rpesented with a gpg shell. Go ahead ant type addkey to generate a subkey. We want to be able to customize what this key can do so we're going to select number 8 RSA (set your own capabilities). This is why we needed to edit the key in expert mode.  By default, the key has the capability to sign and encrypt but not to authenticate. This is the exact opposite of what we want. Type S <Enter> E <Enter> A <Enter> Q <Enter> where <Enter> is the Enter key on your keyboard. This will generate a subkey capaable of authentication. Leave the default keysize and set it to expire in a year (again, you can always update this later. It's like a dead man's switch if you will). Set a strong password  Adding the subkeys to the yubikey  Now we are going to move the subkeys to the card.   Select the authentication key by typing key 2. Ensure that an asterisk appears next to ""sub"" of your auth key.  Plug in your YubiKey and type keytocard. Follow the prompts  Congrats! we're done with the gpg shell. Type save to exit it but before you do make note of the 8 character hexidecimal string following the rsa2048/ of your authentication subkey. Copy it to your clipboard. We will need it later.  Configuring gpg-agent to work with ssh  The hard part is over, now we have to configure gpg-agent. Fire up a text editor and put the following lines into ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf  enable-ssh-support write-env-file ~/.gpg-agent-info use-standard-socket  default-cache-ttl 600  max-cache-ttl 7200   Then open up your shell config file (if you don't know what this is, use ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc) and add the following lines  if [ ""${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info"" ]; then     . ""${HOME}/.gpg-agent-info""     export GPG_AGENT_INFO     export SSH_AUTH_SOCK fi   Adding the keygrip to ~/.gnupg/sshcontrol  Now we need to tell gpg which key it should use as an ssh key  Run the following command:  echo ""$(gpg -K --with-keygrip NAME | grep -A 1 AUTHKEYID | tail -n1 | awk -F'= ' '{print $2}') 0"" >> ~/.gnupg/sshcontrol   Where NAME is the name you supplied when generating the subkey and  AUTHKEYID is the 8 digit hexidecimal string you copied earlier.  Making sure GNOME doesn't F it all up  GNOME is great, I love GNOME but the GNOME key agent likes to but in on GPG agent which gives you some errors when using your yubikey. Just execute the following to fix this  cp /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop ~/.config/autostart/ echo 'Hidden=true' >> ~/.config/autostart/gnome-keyring-gpg.desktop cp /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop ~/.config/autostart/ echo 'Hidden=true' >> ~/.config/autostart/gnome-keyring-ssh.desktop    Finally run gpgkey2ssh AUTHKEYID where AUTHKEYID is the same as above and copy the output to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on your servers as you would a normal ssh public key.   Logging out and logging back in should suffice to make all the above changes work but I'd go ahead and restart to be safe.  FIN"

A developer cares more about excellence than about cost-benefit.  When a company is driven top-down, like Canonical, cost-benefit is the primary driver. Developers probably do want to address all those issues, but they are simply overruled and instructed not to ""waste time"". Their cost-benefit is being managed.

EVERY THING ABOUT UBUNTU IS HALF ASSED! Look at the LTS's Linux Kernal, 3.13 an unsported outmoded mess that most distros did not pick, because it sucks. PPA's are better then Ubuntu's own repos, how can that happen! Then their is the fact that they hardly ever update new software. How offten do the QT web browsers get an update, NEVER! DOOBLE IS STILL THE SAME VERSION AS IT WAS IN 12.04! How about wine huh, their's is still on 1.6 when the latest is 1.7.44. Half of thier packages are maintained by the community and not them, that just tells you they are not doing their job of maintaing their dam distro, you don't see Debain or FreeBSD pulling that shit! Canonicle should not be focusing on ""convergence"" if they can't keep their own fucking dam Linux distro up to date. GOD!

LinuxActionShow,39hx26,halherta,2,Fri Jun 12 17:50:14 2015 UTC,"Digital Ocean and other VPS services like Linode and Vultr are great at what they do well, and have revolutionised the industry in terms of offering relatively cheap services which are easy and fast to provision.  That said, it is slightly concerning that so many people appear to be using these service to store private and sensitive data. These VPS services may be more inherently secure than shared hosting, but for any back-end that is storing private data, I'd argue dedicated hosting is the minimum that would satisfy a basic requirement of most PCI audits.  If you're storing your OwnCloud data up in a droplet then that's one thing - your data, your risk assessment, your call. But it makes me uneasy when I see ""web designers"" building e-commerce platforms for their clients where the databases which contain private customer data - including card details in some cases - are hosted up on VPS's.  So, whilst the success of DO is good to see, and their highly competitive pricing, range of services and technical innovation has undoubtedly allowed the development of some great apps that perhaps would never have seen the light of day back in the ""old times"", I do feel that they are being over-used by some due to their strengths (ease of set-up and use, low pricing, etc), for roles to which they're just not well suited from a data security standpoint (the recent KVM floppy disk controller exploit goes to demonstrate how VM ""isolation"" cannot guarantee that your virtual server will actually remain isolated in the real world)."

Most of the Ubuntu's repos are binnary only pacKAGES. Even Debian needs stupid .debs. It is worse for NetBSD and DragonflyBSD.

Discontinued around 2003 because of their big egos. Source code does not exist any more or is impossible to find. PureDarwin:The only project left and it only works on some Intel Macs in a VM and does not even support real hardware. The christmas release is the only one that got x.org to work with a varry old version of XFCE and I mean it is old. xfce looked like a clone of CDE back then, that is how old it is. So far the project seems verry stagment; if not stalled or dorment. I don't know why because if a BSD distro dies some one else comes along and reboots it again just like what happened to DesktopBSD, so why not Darwin? I mean Even with the APL 2 kernal we also have GNUStep for coca, and Darling for the under the hood stuff, and afterstep and window maker for the UI. So in theory we have every thing needed to make an FOSS compable clone of OSX. Reactos is the same thing and even Reactos is starting to get reconion; espically in Russia where a few towns made it their defacto OS. So why not a version for OSX. We have Haiku for Be OS, AROS for Amiga OS 3, Reactos for Windows, Freedos for Windows 9x, OSfree for OS/2 (little devopement), Openindiana for solaris, Linux minux, BSD, and coherent, and yet not OSX!

Like it or not if it is not in Debian it is not considered open. Even ZFS is apparently more open even though it is under the CDDL, witch was created to spite the GPL (history of Open Indiana). It is not like there is much software that apple makes that would even matter, other then their chess game and debian makeing a debian/kdarwin spin, there realy is not much that Debian does not have, so there realy is no point.

In 2013, the GIMP-Win author discontinued use of SourceForge for  download delivery. ...In cases where a project is no longer actively being maintained,  SourceForge has in some cases established a mirror of releases that are  hosted elsewhere.  This was done for GIMP-Win.  When we establish a mirror, we change the status on the project to clearly  delineate it as a mirror, and change administrative control of the project to  clearly delineate that it is editorially curated by SourceForge. Mirrored projects help enable end-users to stay current with the latest  releases, particularly where SourceForge continues to house historical  releases for community benefit. Mirrored projects are sometimes used to deliver easy-to-decline third-party  offers, and the original downloads are always available. Since our change to mirror GIMP-Win, we have received no requests by  the original author to resume use of this project.... Since yesterday, SourceForge Gimp-Win mirror downloads only the  original software without any offers. We also invite the Gimp-Win developer  to take back control of the project if that is his desire, while respectfully  asking that he maintain any project updates or allow us to do so.   https://sourceforge.net/blog/gimp-win-project-wasnt-hijacked-just-abandoned/  So there is no ""bad behavior"", there is no ""hijacking"", there are no ""d-bags"" other than those who continue to repeat claims that simply aren't true but fit their ideology so they accept them uncritically."
LinuxActionShow,398lb4,alcalde,2,Wed Jun 10 20:43:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think people are pissed off about sourceforge ""hijacking"" or from the sourceforge view picking up an abandoned project and looking after it. I think that is commendable. However what people are ticked off with is the fact sourceforge was adding adware/malware into the installer of the opensource product. That is horrible it devalues the purpose of opensource and everything it stands for."
LinuxActionShow,398lb4,kiwilinux,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:23:14 2015 UTC,"It's completely allowed within the terms the project is licensed under. It's the same as charging $5 for a CD with the software on it, except in this case it's software the user can opt out of installing. It might be annoying but it's not an affront to open source. Sourceforge did a lot of good via hosting open source projects and they've got to keep the servers running somehow."
LinuxActionShow,398lb4,alcalde,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:48:51 2015 UTC,charging $5 for a CD is different than bundling adware and malware especially when there is no easy way to avoid installing it. The reason opensource software became popular is because you weren't bundling  such destructive software with your application. And code was available to be viewed. Plus these so-called installers are  wrapped around the original installer and are closed proprietary software and not what the original created wanted. Having ads is on the web page is ok but then again they shouldn't be d-bags about tricking the visitor into click the wrong thing

LinuxActionShow,398smv,p4p3r,2,Thu Jun 11 16:45:43 2015 UTC,I just switched form Arch to Fedora and I really like it :D
LinuxActionShow,398smv,andreicristianpetcu,2,Wed Jun 10 14:49:05 2015 UTC,Mind if I ask what prompted you to make the switch? And what rly stands out for you?
LinuxActionShow,398smv,010101a,3,Wed Jun 10 17:06:31 2015 UTC,"Let me start off with ""Arch GNU/Linux is awesome!!!"". It really is, I love how the community manages to make all the pieces fit together even if they are brand new, but Arch is a puzzle. You need to fit all the peaces together by yourself and that is fun. But sometimes I want to do my job and focus on my app not on the entire OS. Arch puts a lot of power in the package maintainer's hands. If Arch pushes the latest foo-lib to everybody then the developers of awesome-bin that uses foo-lib need to update. This type of situation is really common with broken AUR packages that once worked and now they do not. Package maintainers have more control that app developers and OS users.  Fedora on the other hand is a cohesive whole. From the boot loader, plymouth to Gnome Shell they all fit together. If I want to use Gnome Shell only after it hist 3.18.1 and not 3.18.0 since the .0 one might have unported extensions I can with Fedora but I cannot with Arch."
LinuxActionShow,398smv,andreicristianpetcu,2,Wed Jun 10 19:17:36 2015 UTC,Interesting. Thanks for elaborating. I think I might try running 22 on a VM and see if it lives up to all the hype it's been getting.
LinuxActionShow,398smv,010101a,2,Wed Jun 10 20:05:53 2015 UTC,"Before I switched I used Fedora 21 in VirtualBox, installed a lot of stuff and updated to 22 when it came up.  I also like Fedora because it has offline updates (but you can manually update with no restart if you wish), FedUp which is quite nice, dnf package manager (which will land on servers that host my apps in a few years). I had a problem with a package and did a offline update and it tried to update, failed and rolled back the package transaction. After reboot I checked the logs, and did a manual online update and fixed my issue.  I will get a good headsup about what will land in RHEL and I will be familiar with that. There is also a philosophical reason why I switched: I really like Fedora's attitude about Free Software. If I ever become a package maintainer I wish to maintain either Fedora or Debian packages since I really like the values of these distros. So my switch was not 100% pragmatica :D  If you start using Fedora, be sure to check out Fedy. It helps you install all the proprietary malware that others force on you like Flash Player or Skype :)"

Day after that I installed it on my HDD alongside Windows 7.  Today I'm still using arch on my windows free PC. Yesturday I even installed arch on my company office PC. I have good IT guys there.

Microsoft's cleartype font rendering (do they still use this?) - is optimized for extremely clear and crisp text. This becomes apparent especially at smaller font sizes even on low res displays.  Ubuntu's font rendering is relatively blurry - and does not work well on smaller font sizes.  That said, I prefer ubuntu's as well."

I don't want to argue about which is allegedly best in a subjective sense.  I want to know, specifically, what accounts for the differences?  For example:  Fedora/OpenSuse avoid use of certain font rendering techniques because they fear legal entanglement in patent issues.  Common sense says Microsoft would use those techniques.  Do they?  Canonical and others use the encumbered techniques because they are in a different legal situation.  Does, then, Microsoft also use the same techniques as Ubuntu? If so, what accounts for the differences in the text display?  I'm asking questions like this:  Is Microsoft not using the patent-encumbered techniques that Fedora/OpenSuse avoid, and Canonical does not?  If so, why?  (I don't vote down or up.  It's a silly game.)"

I don't know the specific patents in question, but as someone with a software patent I can say that they cover very specific implementation details followed by a ton of lawyer speak. I almost did not recognize the paper after my lawyer had a go with it. ;)  Font rendering is a complex domain and they probably have patents on specific parts of it.  Even more likely you might be right in that they have patents that they are no longer using.  Or something else. Others may have a better answer."

Some years ago i had that same question, the answer i was given is that by default Windows renders your fonts assuming you're using a CRT monitor which makes them not look good on ""modern"" screens. This could be changed by modifying the registry. This might not be a proper explanation but the truth is that changing the registry improved the font rendering."

So they headed to her house and drove her computer back to the Pixar offices (Susman and Jacob later recalled the amusing procession, with her computer wrapped in blankets and strapped into a seat belt in the back seat with Jacob nervously watching it as Susman drove). The computer was plugged in and booted up. It had been updated two weeks ago. So they had the original back-up from a few months ago, her current updated version plus whatever other files they could cobble together from the various worker’s individual work stations. That gave them roughly 70 percent of the film’s files (as of the update two weeks earlier) as being verified as working fine. They had to then hand-check all of the directories for the remaining 30 percent to make sure it was correct. That took the entire staff working the whole weekend with very little sleep making sure the other 30 percent of the files were accurate.

Edit: When the machine is booting you might notice that the console is being spammed with ""r"". That is a side-effect of the minimaid.

I've heard of people snagging them for less than $500 but generally I'd say they're still in the region of $1500-2500. I paid a bit more than that for my machine but the previous owner had replaced all of the pad sensors, the sensor brackets, arrow panels, and put a new Tri-sync monitor in the machine. This breakdown below is just kind of a rough estimate especially since the Minimaid is not available for purchase anymore (unless you find one second-hand)   DDR Machine $2000 Minimaid $300 Optiplex $150   > Where do you get your tracks?

LinuxActionShow,38z6qc,pirate59,3,Tue Jun 16 09:11:04 2015 UTC,"I just finished listening to LAS and when it came to near the end someone asked the question about running Linux on a thumb drive.  I listened to Chris and Noah's opinion.  My experience is contrary to theirs.  For the past year I have been running a full install of Linux on a thumb drive.  In my business I use Linux to troubleshoot and fix Windows machines.  To accommodate working on a number of machines at once I have several thumb drives that have a full install of Linux on them with all the necessary diagnostic tools.    I do regular updates and when a new version of the distro is out I upgrade (granted this part does take a long time).    I have three thumb drives for booting into my customer's computers.  Those are mirror images of each other as I use ""dd"" to copy the master.  I keep an ongoing .img file so I can easily make more if needed. I have a 4th that I use to boot into my main desktop.  I also have a 32gb USB 3.0 stick that runs my main desktop.  I've been doing this for over a year now.  I do though have a separate 3tb as my home folder (mounted via the fstab file).  This provides me with adequate storage and fast access to config files.  As I said, I have excellent performance and there have been little to no issues.  When I first started out I had some difficulty getting Linux to boot from the USB 3.0 stick when plugged into a USB 3.0 port on the computer.  After working that out I've been impressed and have not had any motivation to switch back even though I have 2 spare SSDs sitting on my desk in front of me.  EDIT:  And remember, everyone that uses a full distro of Linux on a raspberry pi is doing exactly the same thing."

I understand it was never meant for a production system,  but the way is been referred to over the last month as a toy before an education device gave me the impression that JB believes it doesn't belong in the linux community.   For me the model b device got me started on Linux. Sure it was slow.  But it got me started on Debian and python. I hope I'm not the only one that listens that got into linux this way.  Anecdotally me and my brother in-law managed to get two pi's sending simple data to each other with nothing but leds and ldrs. If people are interested I'm more than willing to share the how's etc. But my point here is without the raspberry pi, i would have never stated into linux.

LinuxActionShow,38x76h,MaTachi,6,Sun Jun 7 17:43:04 2015 UTC,"I find this post to be interesting because I develop technical content for a living. I strive for technical accuracy, but let me tell you, it is pretty difficult. I imagine the RHCSE is a really long and technical course.   From a technical writing/development point of view, if the course says ""cp will not preserve ACLs"" I would consider that statement to be true. They could've done a parenthetical, as in, (the -a, or archive option, will preserve ACLs) but it really depends on the scope of the section. While developing technical content, you're always trying to balance how much information to give. In the case of programs, if you need something really specific, you should just read the man page. In developing content like this, I wouldn't want to write too much, because the amount that the reader retains goes down dramatically. If you understand the nature of command line programs, I'd think you'd look at the man page. Maybe that's just me. I'd be impossible to writing something ""complete"" about GNU/Linux, it just keeps going deeper. Even further, when it comes to the program itself, I don't find a recreate the man page to be helpful. There are little tutorials everywhere, but it is the fundamental, conceptual information that isn't written about.   Note also that LVM has nothing to do with shrinking an XFS partition. LVM would be happy to resize the XFS partition, but XFS would not be happy about that. Also they probably recommend XFS because Red Hat does.   Their response isn't great, but this is the problem with video instructions. I've just started to develop video content at work... it is expensive, slow, and more expensive. If the instructions were written, then it'd be a 5 minute fix. Now they need to re-record, edit, render and upload the video, PITA. Not that the work excuses it, I'm just sayin', I sympathize."

LinuxActionShow,38x76h,fixles,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:50:02 2015 UTC,It's doing a lot well. Their material is outstanding for those who are new to the Linux ecosystem. Their material is great for those who want to try technology they hear about. The fact you get access to four VPS to try different server ISO spins for 50 bucks every quarter is pretty awesome. You can run them all at the same time if you wanted. I find it hilarious that this guy who started this thread offers no other solution. The material presented is more than enough to whet your appetite and spark imagination. I refer everyone I know who is converting to Linux to play with Linux Academy ---the LPIC courses are very good. F*** the haters! Lol

To be honest, that reply you got from them is incredibly embarrassing for everyone involved, but that could have also been from someone who has worked non-stop for three weeks. I sympathize, but still that is NOT pretty. I do appreciate that they help out the JB crew, as running a network is far from cheap.

On the other hand, system76 has a perfect pitch. it lasts 1-2 min, Chris is recommending them naturally and reasonably.    I feel that only with ting and linux academy its blown out of proportions.    Ive been watching LAS and JB for a long time now. and I also watch other podcast networks which I wont name.

LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,greendragon2010,6,Sun Jun 7 18:49:48 2015 UTC,"Video for LAS is essential IMHO. You guys are trying to reach out to not only established Linux users, but new switchers as well. A lot of times you guys are talking about visual things like GUI interfaces, responsiveness of a DE, icons and themes etc and audio is simply not enough to get that content across to users. I think you guys will lose a lot of viewers (both current and potential) if you go audio only for the big show. If the video conferencing is the big issue, please just take a Sunday off to sort it out but keep the show video."
LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,autodidactos,6,Mon Jun 8 01:12:38 2015 UTC,"I humbly submit the issue is not video but video conferencing.  Until recently, the big show was two guys in the same room.  Now one of them is hundreds of miles away.  As someone who remembers the old audio-only show, it's hard for me to express how big a step up it's been watching the migration to video.  The ability for me to 'engage' in the program, often in real time set this network apart from every other program I regularly listened to.  I remember watching Jeremy help Chris assemble the hackintosh over several hours.  That was a gas. EB"
LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,beyere5398,10,Sun Jun 7 23:44:28 2015 UTC,"I am going to be entirely honest here. If it wasn't for video, I wouldn't watch. If it is just audio, the ADHD in me makes me have to do something else. If I do something else, I won't really be paying attention to the show as much, and will miss alot. This is why I don't really listen to Unfilter or Unpluged. They are great shows, and I do sometimes listen, but without video I can't get into it and really ""watch"". Thus I watch maybe 1 in 10 eps of those shows.  Don't get me wrong, if I had a menial job, an audio podcast is nice. If you have to do something over and over again, with your brain free, then yeah, audio only could be focused on. But this isn't doable for me. Except maybe when mowing the lawn, but that doesn't take enough time."
LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,theredbaron1834,6,Sun Jun 7 19:45:47 2015 UTC,"It's interesting. I'm actually completely the opposite. If the shows were video only and had no option to at least get an audio feed, I would never watch them. I'm in the car often for hours a day, so an audio show is perfect for the long commute. As well as for listening during workouts or chores around the house or yard work. I almost never watch the video versions of the show. Occasionally I'll grab the video of Faux Show, but that's only because that show doesn't lend itself to audio at all. But it's rare that I watch.   I do understand the different use cases though."
LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,irrationalNumber,2,Sun Jun 7 19:55:14 2015 UTC,"Back when I worked with my dad, I was the same way. Water Softener installer, who worked all over Indiana, so I had hours at a time driving, and I did a lot of audio listening back then. Now, not so much.  Here is the thing though, you can easily go from video to audio, but not from audio to video.  At least, as long as as said video goes into it knowing people are going to listen to it as well. Thus, I think keeping video is better :)."
LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,theredbaron1834,5,Sun Jun 7 21:35:05 2015 UTC,Pretty poorly formulated. Is the question whether we (the audience) want LAS to move to audio only? Why does that imply higher quality?
LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,MaTachi,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:02:09 2015 UTC,"Why does that imply higher quality?   I guess the problem is that video is just a pain in the butt atm and delays the show, stresses Chris out potentially leading to a lower quality show."
LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,blackout24,2,Sun Jun 7 21:06:32 2015 UTC,"Plus it takes much less time to set up and edit, leaving more time for actually producing the show and more advanced editing.  They could then more easily do the entire workflow of the show in Linux.  I however, fall into that camp where if there was no video, I probably wouldn't follow the show."

LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,kaipee,3,Sun Jun 7 23:51:44 2015 UTC,"I can't say I wouldn't tune in the network were audio only. I spend most of my time doing the audio-only route in the car (TTT, LUP, WTR) and my Monday nights are usually spent watching the previous day's LAS. I'd love to keep the video of LAS around but I'm sure that's where most of the issues are coming from. If it makes it easier and saves Chris extra frustration and elevated blood pressure so he's able to carry on, I'd deal."
LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,Robsteady,2,Mon Jun 8 00:53:43 2015 UTC,"I have to say, I rarely get to watch live or see video so this doesn't much apply to me. I do question if this wouldn't be taken as a step back, and used to point at a ""weakness"" in Linux.   Personally, I would not even notice the change, but I must admit I'd prefer it to be a temporary measure. If it's only a month or two while things get figured out it should be fine, and it's infinitely a better solution than being off air."
LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,Beefki,2,Sun Jun 7 22:06:45 2015 UTC,Chris have you considered audio with streaming. Like unfiltered I think that will help those of us who like the visuals. I would like to encourage those who can to support JB to do so.
LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,linuxuser706,2,Sun Jun 7 23:20:39 2015 UTC,"I like the video on occasion, but  the audio is what's most important. I can only make the live broadcast every once in a while anyway, and if not live, I only listen."
LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,kyoei,2,Mon Jun 8 00:52:06 2015 UTC,KEEP VIDEO PLEASE  Hi long time viewer of Jupiter Broadcasting content and if anything I would like to see more video I wish all the shows did video instead of just showing a chat room that I dont really care about.  You could put chat room and video side by side would be ok with that.
LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,thermalzombie,2,Mon Jun 8 03:16:17 2015 UTC,"So lately I've been tuning in to ""the big show"" live, and so have witnessed how distracting (demoralizing?) video issues have been for Chris and Noah (I've learned a lot about the tech just by experiencing their troubleshooting efforts). Ironically I almost never get to see the whole thing through because, well, at least one member of my family has other plans. That usually means seeing the first 15 minutes, struggling to listen for the next 30, and finally having to give up after that. For the most part the only way I actually get to experience a whole program is by downloading the .ogg file and listening to it  while taking a long walk (my one activity that's free from interruptions -- funny how they let me alone for that!). So while I think the video is valuable, especially for events like fests, for me it wouldn't be a ""show-stopper"" if most episodes were audio only (with links to supplemental videos in the show notes). There's also something to be said for the value of being able to produce the show solely with Linux, not to mention the preservation of the producers' sanity. Note: I'm a big fan of Coder Radio, an explicitly audio-only show (well, it does have ""radio"" in the title!), and can't say that video would make it any better."
LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,philnc,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:36:52 2015 UTC,Everything gets messy before it improves.  They need to be patient.  The excuses that I'm hearing are the same reasons people are giving for not switching to Linux from Windows.
LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,jdblaich,2,Mon Jun 8 23:00:25 2015 UTC,"This is my personal preference, and not ""the direction I think the show should go in,"" but it's just too confusing to temper my preferences with the success of the show (or how much it will cost to cater to my preferences), so I'm only going to do the former, so with that caveat stated:  A large part of what attracts me to the show is the app reviews. In fact, if you had a separate show with just the app picks, ""Runs Linux"", and the software reviews, I might not even watch anything else. That's not to say the rest isn't valuable, but for me the rest isn't compulsive watching.  For those app picks and reviews, I think having video is invaluable. However, seeing your faces isn't essential, so if that makes it better / easier, it might be OK just seeing a computer screen the entire time. The rest would probably be better in an audio format, and even though I just said ""I might not even watch the rest"", in an audio-only format, it might fit into my life in other ways -- instead of watching a one-hour video on my TV, I could passively listen to it at work.  The other comment I'd make about quality / quantity is length. These shows (not just LAS but also Unplugged, Tech Talk and the rest) are just too long to fit into my life. If they were cut down to 20-odd minutes that would be ""a meal"" length. If they were cut down even further into 5 minute chunks that would be ""snack-sized"", and I could fit a lot more of them into my day compared with the solid one-hour required for consumption currently. As an example, I would hear the shit out of a TTT in the morning if it was 5 minutes audio-only.  Sometimes it's about carefully dividing up the information already in the videos, but other times it's really about editing a conversation down to its core. I know that's probably more work, but if you're listening to a podcast and ""multitasking"", then the conversational style makes it really hard to keep track of what's going on. Having said that the conversational style is what makes this show entertaining.  On a related note, there's a ""lag"" between Chris and Noah when they are not co-located, and this is maddening. It breaks the flow of the conversation and it can often take extra seconds to bring the show back into line. I think a large part of this is the video feed. If you move Noah to pure audio and choose codecs carefully, you'll probably get better results. Alternatively, have Noah record a video feed with high quality audio, but actually converse via audio-only, then re-splice the video (somehow) in post production.  I should say the big show as it stands is excellent, and valuable to the Linux community. I'm trying to be honest and critical, but not put anyone down here. Hopefully this comment is useful and productive for JB."
LinuxActionShow,38xnwn,thesunnyk,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:29:31 2015 UTC,"I think this is an interesting question.  If you look at it, there are more JB shows that are basically audio only than there are video-based shows. Sure, there's the enhanced feed with the chat room, but that doesn't really change that the shows are audio in nature.   I totally understand that video is a massive expense, in software, hardware, infrastructure; something that needs constant attention, updates, upgrades, and work. Plus, it's not something that can be done totally under Linux.   I think the video is great, but if sacrificing the video for higher quality audio productions, as well as ones that can be produced totally under Linux, I would be fine with that. The current group of audio-based shows are fantastic and lack nothing for being audio-ony. Plus I'm sure it would be a massive load of stress and worry off the shoulders of the JB crew. Additionally, with Apple drastically changing their software line up (such as killing iPhoto and a professional application like Aperature), as well as doing away with customizable machines, the future of basing a professional production setup on Apple systems is extremely in doubt. And if there were 1:1 replacements under Linux for the proprietary options, I'm sure we wouldn't even be having this conversation.   TL;DR: If it helps the JB crew, and makes for richer shows, I'm all for it."

Maybe another solution would be to have a less strict time window or a slightly shorter show."

Unless you're willing to wait on new SSLs expiring in a year or 18 months.   If I were to run this on a production server that I manage I would want to see the source code.   Also you could set up a conky or even a calendar event to remind you once you get the SSL. If this were to re-apply for the SSL who's to say that company or person will still be using the same card to pay for them?   It also concerns me that you don't have your end set up so that you aren't blacklisted as spam. Who is hosting your back end?   I'm not trying to troll you these are just questions that should be answered in alpha before you release to the public at large.   Good luck on your project!

No word on if they'll ever make one for Linux. Doubtful, I'd say. Maybe when (if) there are more Linux based Steam Machines deployed than XBox. One hapless Wii user on the forum asked if Skype for Web would be available for that platform and got this polite response:   Thanks for your interest. Currently the Nintendo Wii U browser is not in focus as the team is concentrating on a great experience on desktop browsers with a keyboard and mouse set up.

Most likely e-mails would not use an open protocol and providers would try to lock users in their service. So, an Yahoo mail user would not be able to send e-mails to a Gmail user.  Even if I wouldn’t care about freedom and privacy, it's still annoying that I have to use a lot of different applications (such as Skype, Facebook, Tweeter, Telegram, WhatsApp, Google Hangouts or Yahoo Messanger) to be able to keep in touch will all my friends who use different apps and services. In an ideal world I would be able to chose an app and communicate with friends using other apps through an open chat protocol. Sure there are apps like Pidgin that allow me to connect to multiple services, but they often do not provide the full functionality or are buggy (for instance, Pidgin does not notify me of messages I received on Facebook while offline).  I am glad to see initiatives that promote distributed services and open protocols. Supporting projects like this is the only way of showing that we do not agree with the current situation. We care about privacy, we care about freedom and we do not want to be locked in a service or another, nor to be forced to use multiple services and apps for the same task."

I've used arch and ubuntu for several years now and have only recently decided to go for some certifications to see if I can turn my love of Linux into a career. Even with only home server experience (and some digital ocean droplets), I've found some errors as well. Mostly I notice spelling/grammar errors, but I've ran into a few things which are either just wrong or a bit more difficult than they need to be.   That being said, there's really no where else I know of to have a comprehensive set of videos explaining all of these concepts. Plus, the lab servers are awesome. As long as you don't rely solely on their videos and quizzes to study you should be fine. And the instructors are always telling you to check the man pages... Which is exactly how I noticed the few errors I was able to find."

It lacks the polish to match the marketing, and compares poorly to the completeness & attention to detail of the other sponsors.  I started with the Introduction, then the Essentials and, as already more advanced user, I'm flying through the vids. Shame I can't make it run at 1.3x like I do for podcasts.  I'm sticking with it though. Just adjust your expectations by comparing A$3,500 for a 4day RHEL RHCSA vs US$200/yr for a wider selection of self paced courses.  I gave up sending bug tickets for inaccuracies, repetition, poor grammar etc after only doing half if the intro course.. There were just too many.  Ultimately, kudos to the dudes for putting in that amount of work. Thanks for doing it for such an affordable price. Fingers crossed then their marketing will get the dollars rolling in and get them to a point where they can attract some professional trainers with better attention to detail, or give them enough breathing room to make the improvements themselves.  I give them a 6.5/10 for quality, 7 for content and 9 for fitting my needs. Using their coursework I'm confident I can pass any exam I attempt."

If you say ""I can do Windows too"", you will end up doing that more than anything else.  Worse than that, they'll some how come to the conclusion that your Windows time doesn't take away from your Linux time at all.  Eventually they'll come to the conclusion that you're just not productive.  (There's some exaggeration here about how bad it is but you get the point.)   There's this temptation to be the ""jack of all trades"" at a job interview.  It's a trap.  Employers who want that don't know what they want.  They only know that when they hire someone who can't do everything they didn't know they needed to do... they're unhappy.  It's never ""gee I'm stupid for trying to hire this way.""  It's always ""so hard to find good help these days.""  You are ""good help."" You're just not the infinite source of it that employers are looking for.  It's best not to entertain that notion at an interview.  Resist that temptation.  Don't feed the bears it almost never works out well in the end.  If you're in a bind put some Windows on your resume and take the job.  But don't stop looking.  I don't know anyone who landed their dream Linux job on their first cast of the net.  While we're talking about after you're hired...  Sometimes getting a new job necessitates a move.  This is your chance. Don't let your new neighbors even have the opportunity to entertain the notion that they have their own IT department next door.  I try to not lie but sometimes admitting to your neighbors that you work in a IT or programming field is the absolute worst thing you can do.  The only way to fix it is to move out and tell your new neighbors that you're a back room manager for a department store (check to make sure there's one in your area first).  Seriously, they don't know where to go with that and will never ask you for anything.  You don't necessarily have to LIE lie.  Well, if you consider a lie of omission a white lie.  For example one job I had was working IT support for a call center.  Tell them you work for a call center and let them assume the rest.  (I say this mostly in jest.

The way I see it, it's no worse than them coming over to my house later under the false pretense of caring about me and then asking for a favor.

You will need to install:   libimobiledevice usbmuxd gvfs with the gvfs afc backend   It looks from your flair you're on Ubuntu: you should have all the above stuff installed as default on every *buntu but Kubuntu. On Kubuntu you will need to install them plus a file manager supporting the AFC protocol - Nautilus does not - I suggest the qt version of PcManFM, from Lxde project.  You will need to disable the pin on your iDevice and after that if you plug it in, it will be mounted and you will see it as two volumes in your file manager.  There are 2 ""volumes"": the first is the internal space of the iDevice, basically you will be able to browse your photos as it was a camera because the remaining folders  are encrypted.  The second volume, named Documents something is the area where the apps have their folders: these are not encrypted and you will be able to move files from and to them as they were folders on an external drive. This means, as an example, that you will files in VLC app - of course if you have installed VLC on your iDevice - directory but you will not able to browse the iOS original Video app folders.  Check what happens on your favorite music player - the iDevice support may vary.  Last but not least: I never found my way to iTunes  on Linux - I mean by Wine and its derivatives - , then for for iOS updates if you do not want to use the on the air updating, full backup and so on you will need a VM with a proprietary OS iTunes compatible.  Finally there's a more geeky way to mount an iDevice by CLI: it is ifuse, it works fine and let you mount folders on the iDevice as they were volumes - however I guess it's not a good way to encourage people moving to Linux."

I agree that experience changes your understanding and use of Linux, but I don't think it's a good idea to think of distro-hopping as a ""newb sport"", if you will.

Most of the time it is X.org and being a Ubuntu end user I have no clue how to fix it and I don't have the time or the want to mess with it. I have tried Antergros, how ever it ussaly breaks after a day or two and for me that is not acceptiable. So, I then went to LMDE 2 as  Chris recomened it. He said that Debian Sid was more stable and rolling like Arch and like an idiot I tired it. The issue is that Debian relys to much on .deb files and .deb files get removed after and dist upgrade so I use them as less as possible. That is why I use LM Cinnamon, it has the mint tools and the best Ubuntu based repos. How ever Canonicle is a lazy son of a bitch. They hardly add new packages and in 14.04 they removed ffmpeg, WHAT THE FUCK WHERE THOSE PEOPLE THINKING. i HAD TO ADD THREE PPA'S TO GET FFMPEG TO WORK MARK SHUTTLEWOTH AND YOU THINK YOU CAN GO PUBLIC WITH THIS SHIT! AHHHHHHHH. By the time I am done Mint is whell not really mint. I have over 60 PPA's and two other repos (debgames, and debpackages, and a office repo server thing) (see ISO9660 for some of the ppa's I have more now). The issue is I want up to date software that works, and I want the open source software I use in the repos and not have to add so dam ppa, even fucking Lutris does not have a ppa, just a dam .deb file ah! Ubuntu is to old, Debian lacks packages, and arch is a no go. I though about using Play Linux, but they lack the mint repos and mint tools like their update manager (ubuntu copy that you worthless ass hats!)and they are now working on a fork of Cinnamon. Then there are the one distro desktops like Bungie, Patheion, DDE 2, and while they can be installed on Mint they are verry ficial. I can't get DDE 2 to install as it is not in the noobslab ppa, but the tools are like thier media player, and Deepin Games, but not the desktop. Bungie does not install and nether does Patheon, and Enlighenment is outmoded, and their are no binnary backages for CDE, how ever they do have motif, but loging into in just gives a black screen and you nave to do a ctrl + alt + backspace to get out and we still don't have any stable builds of Elotie, EDE, or Trinity on Mint and Black Lab Linux removed their CDE respin and now Bondi is forking enlighenment."

Many 10GBe cards also have active cooling, and demand 4-8 pcie lanes.    Clearly OEM's aren't jumping to integrate a costly feature that most consumer's won't use, so it remains expensive for the time being."

While I don't generally play games that require great frame rate (I like Civilization, Cities: Skylines, 0 A.D, etc., probably the closest I come to a current shooter game is with L4D2), I haven't really had a problem playing them a 4k. I honestly wouldn't bother with the 4k monitor at this point if your plan is to watch TV and movies at 4k, since the content isn't really there yet. You're better off getting the video card then.  The reason I got my 4k monitor (and why I probably wouldn't give it up) is for coding. I have so much screen real estate with my 4k monitor (especially with my two order monitors next to it) that I have no excuses not to have top productivity. If you need to see a lot of text on screen at once, I highly recommend a 4k monitor.  As for hi-dpi support, I wouldn't really know. I use KDE and I force it to render as if it's drawing for a 120 DPI monitor (my 1080p ones). Things on my 4k monitor are small, but that's fine for me since I have good vision and if I really need to see a ""real"" size, I can just move a window to another monitor."

Even with the $50 drop in price the 980 is about to receive the price/performance of the 980ti makes the 980 and Titan X both not worth considering.  Deciding on monitor or graphics card for first upgrade, there are advantages to both.  The 4k will be a huge upgrade for screen real-estate for coding, but will be rough on gaming with the 760.  Getting the graphics card first will give you access to 1080p gaming rendered at 4k, which eliminates the need for anti-aliasing in most games while you wait for the monitor funds to show up.  However...  AMD is releasing specs on the new Fiji architecture in the next two weeks.  These new graphics cards will have an open source driver called AMDGPU.  The configuration tool Catalyst will still be closed source, but AMDGPU is open and in the kernel which should give access to KMS and other things you can't get with Nvidia closed drivers.  Personally I'd 'suck it up' on the 760 / 1080p for a little longer and see how it plays out for another month or two.  (I'm waiting on my 560ti / 1080p to see how AMD handles the open sourcing of their driver before I spend any cash on upgrades)."

LinuxActionShow,38639z,2bluesc,3,Tue Jun 2 02:54:08 2015 UTC,Just watched this week's LAS and enjoyed the Yubikey section.  A while back I added Yubikey support to KeePassX using challenge response feature of Yubikey.  For those not familiar challenge response is way more secure then a static password as it protects against the vast majority of replay attacks while still working completely offline.  Unfortunately the maintainer of KeePassX isn't interested in merging or even commenting... so I've been forced to fork it.  ... and it's on AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/keepassx2-yubikey-git/

I think it is very elegant in a lot of ways and is one of the most polished desktops out there.  That doesn't diminish that previous iterations of Gnome 3.x were lacking.  Even with extensions it wasn't all the way there.  For example, the Dash to Dock extension is worlds better at this point than it was even a few months ago.  There are things that still absolutely drive me up the wall like the extension compatibility between releases and the wallpaper selection settings dialog.  I can still not understand why they won't let me select a different folder or wallpaper size via the standard wallpaper settings page and I am forced to go to the Tweak Tool to do wallpaper.  Wallpaper just doesn't seem like a tweak tool level thing and for an average user should just be there.  I think Gnome is going to continue to improve in a lot of ways and I look forward to it."

And for the biggest issue is for me that the community that preaches Open Source Philosophy doesn't feel it necessary to apply that to their council process with all debates and discussions being completely transparent. Including behind the scenes finances and decisions. Then the Riddell fiasco wouldn't have manifested. Hmmm checked the show links no links about it.   As to the extreme Gnome fanboism statements hope he would emphasize more of a personal take for his use then blanket statement covering All of Linux feeling.  Glad to hear Noah stand up and try to point out some of Gnome's negatives side. Really getting tired of all the Gnome Trumpeting Fanfare. I feel that LAS is doing other DE's and WM's a disservice with so much constant Gnome talk which may comprise only about 30% of total Linux users?    Slowly losing my desire to tune in. Just seems like a constant Gnome,Cloud,Droplet,Servers occasionally Mate talk and less about regular desktop use and apps. Makes me wonder if Fedora 22 was chosen because the default is Gnome? And would it have been reviewed on the show if the default was Cinnamon,Xfce or KDE? Which I believe each of those separately has just as many users against Gnome's numbers."
LinuxActionShow,385h7b,p4p3r,2,Tue Jun 2 15:53:42 2015 UTC,"I think fedora was chosen because they've made a lot of changes recently and because Noah uses it.

Gnome is a tiny bit ahead of KDE now, but when plasma 5 starts to get some real polish, as gnome is now, I expect to hear more about it, as we did when the KDE team was talking about all the features.  Gnome, cloud, droplet, servers... Yes we hear about that because that is what's happening.   People love to complain but never make suggestions that are actionable."

I use i3 wm and roll my own DE like features on most of my boxes, and i3 rarely gets mentioned.

A colleague, who is a developer that came over to the sysadmin side several years ago, and I were discussing this yesterday. Both of us are hardcore graduates of the ""security first, we'll talk about the rest later"" school. The problem is exactly as Chris describes. Devs (and some sysadmins) who put expedience before security need someone to push back. Although  they argue (and may believe) that a no update world is more stable, it almost always falls apart the first time a major exploit comes along. After news of the latest zero day threat to WordPress broke we mobilized the affected devs and got the updates done in record time. Afterwards I had at least one note that things went much more smoothly because we'd been diligent about keeping everything (mostly) current up to that point (that, and his getting everyone to start using child themes so updates to Core didn't break anything). Honestly, I'd be wary of relying on stock containers up on the Hub. If my devs found one they really wanted I'd lobby for our own fork that could be regularly updated by one of our system management tools (for example, Chef or Salt)."

Regain your energy so you can continue to fight the good fight. However, when you are in such a position, it's sometimes hard to see how far you've gone.  The UCC made a bad move. However, making a bad move is better than making no move at all. I think the fallout would've been a lot worse if the UCC let this escalate.  You can discuss whether or not there was a better move available, but in the end, that's not going to change much of the current situation. I think we should focus now on how to move forward. I think the UCC and the KC should communicate and resolve this, and we as a community have little to say about this.

LinuxActionShow,38316p,palasso,12,Mon Jun 1 14:19:39 2015 UTC,"The issues the Kubuntu Council raised to the Ubuntu Community Council  The 2 issues that Jonathan Riddell, a representative of the Kubuntu Council, raised to the Ubuntu Community Council were about the IP policy and the donations.  a) The IP policy as-is currently states that an ubuntu derivative has to either obtain a license by Canonical (probably with some payment) or recompile the entire Ubuntu archive. Since it's FLOSS there are some uncertainties to the legality of this, since FLOSS is freely redistributable (even if modified) by a user without restriction to its use (freedoms 0,2,3).  b) There have been some hundreds of thousands of dollars being raised as donations by users (some of which for the Ubuntu Community) and there is no precise report to the Ubuntu Community of where the money went other than this.  What is the Ubuntu Community Council  The CC consists of 8 people. One of them is Mark Shuttleworth and the other 7 are nominated by Mark Shuttleworth and elected by the Community for a term of 2 years.  Currently there are 2 Canonical employees (Michael Hall, Daniel Holbach), one Canonical ex-employee (Laura Czajkowski), the Canonical owner (Mark Shuttleworth) and another 4 from the community.  One of the roles of the CC is to resolve issues of violation of the CoC and community disputes with the participation of involved members.  The decision being made  The CC says that Jonathan violated the CoC not because of the context of the issues he raised but due to the tone he used in them and that they have no issue with KC itself raising those important issues (as Jonathan acted as a representative for the KC). They say they don't recognise him anymore as a ""leader"" of the project.  Later on IRC Michael Hall (Canonical employee, Ubuntu Community Manager and CC member) of the CC talked to the KC that the CC was open to discuss of the potential usefulness of Jonathan Riddell for potentially being reincluded in the future in proceedings with the CC.  The reaction to the decision  The KC says that the decision of the CC was without the participation of the KC in the CC proceedings as required and there has not been put forward any evidence by the CC of any violation of the CoC thus they don't recognise the decision of the CC.  They also do not wish to discuss the matter further as long as the CC doesn't retract from their position.  Mark Shuttleworth has said that the CC can choose who to talk with and that the decision is final.  The aftermath  The CC some days later announced they will disclose proof to the KC but their decision is final to not recognize Jonathan Riddell as a representative for the KC for all the matters that the KC needs to communicate with the CC.  There is no change in Jonathan's permissions on Launchpad or his access to the Ubuntu community repo or his status as an Ubuntu member but their decision affected the motivation of community members (there have been posts by members some of whom are on the brink of leaving the Ubuntu Community).  Closing thoughts  Personally I believe that CC, the highest ranking decision body in the Ubuntu community and a vehicle for Canonical (most members are either Canonical affiliates or nominees by Mark Shuttleworth), tries to exercise control over the community. Unfortunately for them they can't control if Jonathan is perceived as a leader by the Kubuntu Community. The Kubuntu Community can continue to work as usual with appointing a different Canonical liason.  In my opinion there is an ongoing and lasting friction between Canonical and Kubuntu for some time for many reasons for which I've written more here.  P.S.: CC stands for (Ubuntu) Community Council, KC for Kubuntu Council and CoC for Code of Conduct. Also although not specifically mentioned the Leadership CoC is also implied whenever CoC is used."

LinuxActionShow,38316p,palasso,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:37:29 2015 UTC,"It applies to the binaries being produced by Canonical, not provided by Canonical servers. This means that theoretically if I rsynced the binaries to my own server to provide them to the users of my distro I would have to comply with their requirements. It's a debatable issue if they can actually have intellectual property of the binaries that were produced by their build farms just because they were produced by their build farms and if this is compatible with the GPL."
LinuxActionShow,38316p,tarniak,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:52:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Does the GPL, et al, then, afford someone like Canonical the leeway to control who has access to binaries on its servers?

LinuxActionShow,38316p,p4p3r,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:21:18 2015 UTC,Theoretically Canonical could even install a paywall for the whole Ubuntu archive (practically it would demotivate the Ubuntu Community that much that it would disappear) as this is permissible by the GPL but even a single customer could mirror the whole archive to their own server and provide the binaries to everyone else for free. Canonical tries to add additional Intellectual Property rights on the binaries it builts. That makes it against the spirit of free software and potentially even against the letter as well for the reason I explained earlier on (a) on my initial post.
LinuxActionShow,38316p,extradudeguy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:41:27 2015 UTC,"Again, thanks.  I'm uncomfortable with the notion that Canonical, or anyone else, is prevented from exercising some control over use of its servers.

I had nothing against Matt although his personality was not enough to tame Chris. Noah presents real critical thinking on FOSS topics (which is even better given that Chris is prone to be too enthusiastic about stuff). Maybe not RMS-level of critical thinking, but a fair percent. edora 22 discussion is a great example. Fedy vs. non-fedy installation of proprietary software, Elementary OS funding ""methods"" to bring just two topics from recent shows. I believe that LAS has a great balance now.

I did so simply because he's a friend and I think he's doing a great job.   Normally I wouldn't bother commenting any more (busy). But this was a good comment that deserved a response.  Matt"

LinuxActionShow,38316p,SwarmPilot,2,Mon Jun 1 20:40:05 2015 UTC,Youtube commenters suck at life.
LinuxActionShow,38316p,IcyEyeG,2,Mon Jun 1 17:59:49 2015 UTC,"Meh Youtube comments. Worse than 4chan used to be.  Noah is good. An aggressive advocate of Linux and a business man it is good to get his perspective on things from a practical point of view. Not sure what his beef was against embedded Linux though but I get his point about the Pi being a general purpose computer and not an embedded device. But the hardware is not the only thing that needs to be solid when building control systems but it is a mistake to think that Linux cannot fill that role too as I know for a fact it is used in some very critical systems you would not even think about.  But I like Noah as a host as his puts his money where his mouth is and that money is on Linux. Without him I don't feel JB would ever have been able to move to an all Linux broadcasting setup which is where we are definitely moving towards now. Yay!  Besides, he has GoogleGlasses so is cool! ;)"

LinuxActionShow,38316p,totte71,2,Mon Jun 1 14:28:14 2015 UTC,"My impression is that JB didn't want to delve into this very much due to the depressing nature of all the politics and drama around it, so they were short in covering all these aspects which means not talk about the details.  In my post in this thread, which I tried for it to be as short as possible, I do contain a tl;dr of the reasons that CC states which is basically ""the tone/phrasing was against CoC, not the issues themselves which are important, but we can't say why because we have to protect personal sensitive information"".  Personally I'm interested to see the outcome of all this conflict but I'm even more interested about the outcome of the 2 issues that Jonathan rose in the CC. Especially the 1st one (that I mention) is a deal breaker for me to ever contribute packages through PPA, snappy packages etc."

LinuxActionShow,38316p,steryd_net,2,Mon Jun 1 21:43:51 2015 UTC,"A TL;DR story that inspired me to wright this after watching the latest LAS. As a normal consumer I started using DOS and then I migrating to Windows 3.11 then to 95 and so on, all the time I slowly started hearing about linux. My curiosity and some marketing finally lead me in 99 to purchase Red Hat and SUSE linux in Staples (The packaging was awesome but not important). After a couple of months I gave it up due to USB issues and a minor thing with the spreadsheets in the office suite (I think it was star office or open office I cant remember.) so I went back to Windows. Then in 2009 on a whim I installed Fedora 11 and loved it and then after having some problems with codecs turned to the internet and got some solutions, so I tried Mint and I loved it even more and then found out its based on Debian, so I installed Debian and was slightly disappointed so went back to the internet for advise and then came to Ubuntu and I stayed in this pattern ever-since with the occasional diversion to SUSE or the time consuming unfruitful bleeding edge ARCH. Then came Gnome 3, which I adored from the start but unfortunately UnbuntuGnome always lagged behind the latest Gnome release. I am not in anyway down on Ubuntu but because I want to use Gnome 3.16 now I think its time to go back.  I think its time to go back where I started I'm going to to Fedora with there 22nd release. I hope copper is good."

LinuxActionShow,38316p,Ippytraxx,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:15:21 2015 UTC,"I currently run openSUSE, but I first started on Linux on the Fedora Core stuff from way back when.  I'm running the latest Gnome and I find it compelling to use Fedora because of how well they implement Gnome, but a few things would prevent me from switching.  1) I use openSUSE Tumbleweed because I like the rolling factor.  It has been rock solid for me and I appreciate being able to get a quality version of the latest and greatest.  I've grown to like this so much that I find it difficult to go back to a 6-8 month distro.  The 6-8 month way just seems so backwards now that I have used rolling for a fairly long time.  2) The management tools that are included with Yast, specifically how to manage software sources.  Between being able to select different versions of packages and sources etc and finding software on the openSUSE software portal, it would also, for me, seem like a step back to go messing around having to find all the software I'm looking for from a million different places.  3) The upgrade path.  I know Fedup is there, but just like when upgrading an Ubuntu install can be a pain in the ass.  Also, if I'm using third party stuff, I have to wait for all of those things to track to the new release and update everything.  It gets there eventually, but I still have to wait and hope everything gets there.  Unlike openSUSE, I setup the Packman repo and I'm pretty much done setting up repos for the duration of the time I have it installed on my machine.  4) Even though Tumbleweed is rolling, I've found it to be rock solid.  Fedora has gotten a bad rap at times for stability, but it is at the end of the day somewhat of a testing ground for RHEL and I get a little gun shy about committing to a 6-8 month distro that could have some ups and downs depending on what they deploy for that release.  5) Having Gnome Software as the only frontend for DNF.  Gnome Software is fine to install a program, but if I want to use a GUI to manage my software Fedora doesn't have anything like Synaptic, Yast Software, or the various frontends for Arch.  I don't want this to seem like I'm bashing Fedora, or judging it for something that it isn't.  I'm merely pointing out that after being on a rolling distro like openSUSE with great support tools like the openSUSE Portal, it's tough for someone like myself to move to Fedora.  Now, like Chris, I find Fedora VERY compelling because of the corporate of backing from Red Hat, the great implementation of Gnome and latest and greatest features.  I'm probably going to install Fedora 22 on a machine and really live with it for awhile to see how it fairs on a day to day basis.  It certainly is very compelling and for those installs that I want to do for people that I wouldn't use rolling for, Fedora is becoming an ever more compelling option."

Since I haven't used Fedora in a bit, I only knew of the old Yumex which looked woefully out of date compared to the screenshots I just saw of Yumex-dnf.  I guess my overall point was that the pieces are there in Fedora, but I feel that openSUSE puts them together in a bit better way for me right now.  I certainly want to try out Yumex-dnf and see how it works.  I wouldn't mind moving over to Fedora as I like what they do and how their stuff works.  Thanks for the reply."

The Vita, 3DS, yeah, cool features, but ugh. I used the Vita, well, bye bye youtube, barely anything works if Sonys server is down, so many issues. The 3DS, well, the brower/video player/music player sucks arse. I would rather the PSP with the links browser then anything in the new systems. Pass.

LinuxActionShow,382zcv,theredbaron1834,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:22:09 2015 UTC,That's because Vulkan makes different assumptions than OpenGL. It pushes all the work and complexity of the driver into the application. Devs have to make sure the app does the right thing instead of the driver having to assume what the app wants. LunarG who wrote the Vulkan Intel driver for Linux for Valve said that the Vulkan driver is just 25% the codebase of the OpenGL driver.

He is not saying ""Lets make git decentralized""  he is saying ""lets make a decentralized GitHub"" and explains the distinction very well.   Isn’t Git already decentralized?  You might be thinking that while GitHub is centralized, the Git protocol is decentralized — when you clone a repository, your copy is as good as anyone else’s. Isn’t that enough?  I don’t think so, and to explain why I’d like you to imagine someone arguing that we can do without BitTorrent because we have FTP. We would not advocate replacing BitTorrent with FTP, and the suggestion doesn’t even make sense! First — there’s no index of which hosts have which files in FTP, so we wouldn’t know where to look for anything. And second — even if we knew who owned copies of the file we wanted, those computers aren’t going to be running an anonymous FTP server.  Just like Git, FTP doesn’t turn clients into servers in the way that a peer-to-peer protocol does. So that’s why Git isn’t already the decentralized GitHub — you don’t know where anything’s stored, and even if you did, those machines aren’t running Git servers that you’re allowed to talk to. I think we can fix that."

To access it through the web, I use the ownCloud mail app (not roundcube-- I used to use that, but now I don't). One issue you may run into with the Pi and Mail is MailScanner (a program/suite of apps to scan incoming mail for viruses and spam). I tried running it on that netbook that I had, but it slowed it down a lot (it uses a LOT of RAM-- like multiple GBs). It works fine with the 16GB in the Mac Pro, though :)  As for torrenting, I actually do have a torrent web interface for Transmission, and it works great.

Sounds rather half-assed and I call BS on that. As long as large chunks of Jolla are closed source, it offers little what you could not have better with Android. It is also not exactly reassuring when the reason given for the half-assed roadmap is ""to work better with developers and our partners"". The point should be that it is less opaque that way and you could actually start trusting your phone."
LinuxActionShow,37nq7g,philipp22,8,Fri May 29 01:00:50 2015 UTC,"As long as large chunks of Jolla are closed source   You're starting your opinion from a false belief.  There are not 'large' chunks of Sailfish that are Closed Source.  The Closed source parts are the UI layer, which they have stated they will open up... and the AlienDalvik which they do not own.  They cannot open source code that they dont own.    Sailfish largely is open source code, its full linux running Wayland.  The number of closed source 'chunks' is less than what you'd get on Android these days since google has been locking that down.  I've talked with Juhani over the past year and a half, the plan has always been to open source everything they can.  The reason they wanted to have certain parts closed initially, was so they could build the experience so it was polished before open sourcing it all. If you think about it, it makes sense. They want Sailfish OS to be attractive 'as a whole' to people and developers.  If they implemented things open source it one piece at a time,  projects like Cyanogen, would have just copied each piece as they released it and evolved their own products, making Sailfish itself less attractive since it doesnt have any special capabilities.  It's easy to implement one feature at a time into another OS.  It's a lot more difficult to take multiple pieces and implement them.  Yes Cyanogen can implement everything now, but there's less motivation to do so because of the amount of work that it would be, where as if it was done a little piece at a time its easy.  For users, why would you switch to another OS for one feature?  However if there are a large number of benefits, its more attractive.  Jolla has to pay the bills though, that's why got a product to market, and have been continuing to update ALL of their phones as time goes by.  Yes every Jolla phone gets system updates over the air, which makes sense considering its real linux underneath and not a Java VM."
LinuxActionShow,37nq7g,q5sys,2,Fri May 29 14:04:24 2015 UTC,"Well then let me put it this way: A ""substantial"" part is closed source. If the UI is closed source, that is not some immaterial part in the depths of the system but an opaque layer sitting between you and any of your interactions with the device. I too think the developers are great guys and all, but trust in your phone should not be based in benevolent assumptions of present and future (!) motives, but in the thing being open and licensed accordingly. If I remember correctly, Google also claimed the best of intentions before they managed to grab a larger chunk of the market and could afford to do away with it.  And the argument ""they were only polishing it up before releasing it"" is pretty long in the teeth nowadays. Today we know that developing behind closed doors and later throwing the thing over the wall is not good practice. It may still used by Google and the likes, but any serious community knows today that the efficient way to propel a project forward is release early and release often, thereby giving people the opportunity to help, instead of sitting on it.  Lastly, you are still overlooking that until now there are just words. I am perfectly fine to change my mind once there are actions."
LinuxActionShow,37nq7g,philipp22,2,Sat May 30 11:46:54 2015 UTC,I agree.  We have to wait and see if they will add a proper open source license to the code.  Every Jolla ownder or anyone who tinkered around with the system or even only the SDK will know that the basic Silica code is accessible and viewable (at least over 95% is). So if you don't trust the company take a look at the code and see for yourself.  The main problem I see currently is the development behind closed doors.  There are only a hand of user applications like the webbrowser that are developed in the open and people can contribute to.  But when it comes to the mail client for example or the jolla store or even the home screen (lipstick) it isn't. Thats something they need to improve. Improvements there will lead to more useful contributions and faster development cycles.  I hope that we will see that coming with the release of SailfishOS 2.0

People will read something that someone said and then go around preaching it as truth without trying to verify it themselves.

You can't pick what school you go to, you only have a choice if you move which is obviously not a reasonable choice.    This biggest factor here is not that he wasn't aware and screwed up but that the Terms of Use at the school is incredibly over-reaching and even crosses the line into breaking the rights of the student.  The terms of use specifically states that ""Students must not use or possess, on or off school property, a computer program capable of modifying or destroying other school programs or school data."" It then goes on to state ""Prohibited programs include but are not limited to 'Virus', 'Trojan Horse', and the like.""   They are trying to control what a student is allowed to use/possess in their own home. If this was limited to just on school property they wouldn't be over-reaching but they extend it to be in general restrictions thus violating his rights. They have defined the kind of program they are referring to when they use the term ""the like"" because those programs are intended for malicious purposes.

I realize this isnt in the US, but there have been cases in the US where schools have confiscated students phones and found evidence of illegal activity on them... and the charges have been held up in the courts, when challanged on the ground of 'the school had no right to take the phone'  Minors do not have the same legal rights as adults.  And in schools... minor have very few rights actually.  You can thank their parents for that.  Parents have allowed schools to build up legal rights against students under the same BS of ""we're trying to keep them safe"".  Call installing another OS as 'tampering'. 'tampering' = 'vandalism'.  And we all know 'vandalism' is a crime.  All the braindead parents out there are stupid enough to believe that Little Johnny wont get into Yale because some kid was vandalizing school property... and it had nothing to do with the fact that little johnny is skipping class to smoke pot under the bleachers instead of going to class to learn things."

Steam OS gets users started, and then they can eventually move to Linux on their desktops if they desire.  With the Steam Machines launching in Nov for preorders, and out on shelves October. It's just in time for the holiday season. The $450 price point on the entry level Alienware box, is actually pretty decent for the specs. I don't know that I could build an identical PC at that price point. Especially since you have to knock of $50 just because of the included controller. $400 PC with those specs?

Examples of article  Texas sharpshooter fallacy:        A Swedish study in 1992 tried to determine whether or not power lines caused some kind of poor health effects. The researchers surveyed everyone living within 300 meters of high-voltage power lines over a 25-year period and looked for statistically significant increases in rates of over 800 ailments. The study found that the incidence of childhood leukemia was four times higher among those that lived closest to the power lines, and it spurred calls to action by the Swedish government. The problem with the conclusion, however, was that the number of potential ailments, i.e. over 800, was so large that it created a high probability that at least one ailment would exhibit the appearance of a statistically significant difference by chance alone. Subsequent studies failed to show any links between power lines and childhood leukemia, neither in causation nor even in correlation.  This fallacy is often found in modern-day interpretations of the quatrains of Nostradamus. Nostradamus' quatrains are often liberally translated from the original (archaic) French, stripped of their historical context, and then applied to support the conclusion that Nostradamus predicted a given modern-day event, after the event actually occurred.

These are usually packages like themes or extensions to rendering engines or some such, but honestly, what better place to hide malicious code?  In contrast, it's certainly possible that a FOSS-loving employee at some proprietary software firm would care a lot to have their coworkers look at their code and make sure it's secure.

LinuxActionShow,37ddcz,lykwydchykyn,8,Wed May 27 20:15:40 2015 UTC,"Continued Kubuntu drama  Many people might be using Kubuntu without knowing the history of it, the people behind it and the ongoing drama that's been going for years since it became less important for Canonical's plans.  2005: Kubuntu 05.04  Back in 2004 was when Canonical, a new company founded by Mark Shuttleworth, started developing Ubuntu, a GNOME-centric community inspired distribution targeting home users with the motto ""linux for human beings"". It was at around the same time when a young KDE and Debian developer, Jonathan Riddell, having an eye at the prospects of the new player in linux distros, would kickstart the Kubuntu flavor with its first release in April 2005. Afterwards Canonical hired Jonathan Riddell to work on Kubuntu.  2012: Kubuntu loses Canonical funding, finds outside sponsors  It's well known that Canonical shifted its priorities for the desktop when it unveiled its Unity desktop shell. This also affected Kubuntu, which lost its funding when Jonathan Riddell stopped being a Canonical employee. Despite that fact the Kubuntu project managed to find outside sponsors, one of them being Blue Systems.  2013: Kubuntu accepts donations independently also aligns with Wayland  In 1 August 2013 Kubuntu announces its own independent system of donations making the choice to not rely on Canonical's method of raising donations. A large part of that was due to miscommunications and delays into forming a process and delivery of the donations to the community projects. I wrote in a previous post more details on the events.  Of course the Mir debate didn't pass unnoticed with Kubuntu deciding to go with Wayland. From a post on his blog, Mark Shuttleworth seemed to believe that somehow Kubuntu would go with Mir.  2015: Ubuntu Community Council removes Jonathan Riddell as ""Kubuntu Leader"" (with Mark Shuttleworth's approval)  Since 2013 there were online discussions about the possible requirement of a license for the usage of the binary packages from the Canonical archive. Jonathan Riddell had a response to that. It seems that recently there were some enquiries by the Kubuntu Council (with Jonathan as the appointee for representing the KC) to the Ubuntu Community Council about this issue. There were also some discussions regarding the funding of the community projects by the donations.  The CC decided that Jonathan was not doing well his role as ""Kubuntu Leader"" and in an unprecedent move announced to him that he's to step down effective immediately from that role.  The KC mentioned that CC can only make decisions if Jonathan violated the Code of Conduct and asked for the disclosure of proof of such allegements and for the proceedings to be taken transparently.  Mark Shuttleworth replied that the CC can choose which people it will recognize as appointees of representing the sub-communities.  Jonathan Riddell replied that he denies that he violated in any way the CoC and that he does not have a role of ""Kubuntu Leader"". He also replied to Mark Shuttleworth that what he's doing is building the community he was hired 10 years ago by him to build.  Currently the KC is considering the fact that its been stated to them by Mark Shuttleworth that they aren't the ones that choose their representative while they dispute the validity of the proceedings being held in secret without showing any proofs for the allegations while according to the CoC that type of decision should be made with KC as a concerning party.  A CC member and Canonical employee stated that his work in CC was being stressfull and demotivating due to Jonathan Riddell and his pressure towards the issue of the licensing of binaries and that he's not the only one feeling that way.  A long-time contributing member of the Kubuntu team and Council has stated that his motivation for involvement in the project has hit its bottom in a blog post titled ""I think I may be done"". He also posted publicly the emails that took place explaining that the 'firing' of community members in positions cannot happen in closed doors and the rules of the Ubuntu governance require transparency.  Jonathan Riddell also did a short blog post.  There has been a blog post by another member of the Kubuntu team and Council which states quite clearly the position of the KC.  UPDATE: There's been another post by Scarlett Clark. Scarlett Clark was recently interviewed in Women's Coder Radio (part of the Jupiter Broadcasting network) episode: Living The Linux Life  P.S.: CC stands for (Ubuntu) Community Council, KC for Kubuntu Council and CoC for Code of Conduct. Also although not specifically mentioned the Leadership CoC is also implied whenever CoC is used."

It's not like you can just use one or the other as drop in replacement without doing a ton of coding and decide what you want as default for your distro.

One can see the youtube video here as uploaded by the then Ubuntu Community Manager, Jono Bacon.

LinuxActionShow,37ddcz,sam_vde,2,Wed May 27 22:43:01 2015 UTC,"Again with Kubuntu and Canonical, the biggest laugh about all this is the IRC logs that show Mr Riddell being quite argumentative (links it the comments on the Phoronix article) over taking a ""stand"" as he puts it without canonical legal.   Taking a stance without a legal recourse is potential business suicide. I'm not a lawyer (but I have ran my own business in the past and understand some of the legal redtape/bullshit around trademarks) and neither is Mr Riddell (from what I have seen). All Canonical/Ubuntu software is released under the GPL so it is ""free"" software. The argument arises around the ""Ubuntu"" trademark being used in ""modified"" binaries (which is and always will be a much debated total shit-storm, the CLA is a shining example of this). I agree the way the CC asked for Mr Riddell to stand down is imo underhanded, totally unacceptable and raises questions about the CC that I would rather not get into a discussion over. But for Mr Riddell and the KC to totally dismiss the argumentative comments made, belittling of the CCs attempts to correct the issue with a legal recourse and wanting to ""make a stand"" without legal standing in the trademark use areas because of the time taken are also uncalled for and unjustified.  The whole thing will take a turn for the worse no matter the outcome, it will be sad to see all this, especially with the headway Ubuntu and Kubuntu are making as projects in general. I appreciate the fact that Scott K made this very undesirable situation public with the postings he made and it does raise issues (for me at least)with the CC. But I would like to add I do not believe either party to be without blame in this matter."
LinuxActionShow,37ddcz,Switches_wow,3,Wed May 27 12:19:55 2015 UTC,"The argument arises around the ""Ubuntu"" trademark being used in ""modified"" binaries   You misunderstood the legal issue. The legal issue they're facing has nothing to do with the Ubuntu trademark. It's an issue that is with each and every binary package, modified or not, in the Ubuntu archive (which includes packages made by the Kubuntu team, having no trademarks) and it's an issue that Riddell was asking for answers for almost 3 years! The same is true for the other issue (the delivery of the donations that are part of the ubuntu sub-communities)."
LinuxActionShow,37ddcz,palasso,2,Wed May 27 14:39:08 2015 UTC,"It has everything to do with the Ubuntu/Canonical trademark, Canonical got it contact with Linux Mint about paying a ""Licence fee"" (which is where all this with the licencing started) as they use the Ubuntu binaries (many of them being GPL) the problem rises in this part of the IP Rights Policy  ""Any redistribution of modified versions of Ubuntu must be approved, certified or provided by Canonical if you are going to associate it with the Trademarks. Otherwise you must remove and replace the Trademarks and will need to recompile the source code to create your own binaries. This does not affect your rights under any open source licence applicable to any of the components of Ubuntu. If you need us to approve, certify or provide modified versions for redistribution you will require a licence agreement from Canonical, for which you may be required to pay.""  Mint does not recompile them, they also mask the original repos i.e http://packages.linuxmint.com/pool/upstream/v/virtualbox/ those are all ""ubuntu"" compiles. same as here http://packages.linuxmint.com/pool/import/k/kde-baseapps/.   Now the issue there is a legal one, agreeing to base your product on Ubuntu basically means you have to strip the naming or licence the product. Now again this raises another issue in the IP rights statement above, It's way to vague and it seems Bluesystems the Kubuntu sponsors had some real problems with this (understandable from a business perspective when also tied into the CLA).  This post http://www.networkworld.com/article/2226367/opensource-subnet/making-sense-of-the-ubuntu-licensing-fiasco.html kinda sums it up. Both parties are right, the terms are so damn vague though that it borders insanity."

I like anaconda. Once you wrap your head around the idea behind it, it is really simple to use. The partition tool is different but works well enough. Maybe I'm just getting used to it :-)  I have added rpmfusion repos and installed bumblebee as detailed at http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bumblebee . Bumblebee is kinda bugged for this laptop model and I don't get the whole powersaving benefits. This is not fedora specific, but a firmware/driver problem. Using the nvidia card with primus works.  wayland is working fine here. GDM just works, even the gnome-wayland session starts up and looks fine. Copy and paste needs to be fixed before I consider it seriously though.  Firefox finally uses gtk3 now. Some things are a little glitchy (dialog buttons look strange) and the flash player is not working everywhere. I hope this will be fixed in later firefox updates.  Eclipse (SWT) also uses gtk3, which also introduced some more annoying bugs. Scrolling is sometimes strange, fonts in overlays are sometimes broken and the background of the overlays are sometimes black (they are supposed to be light colored).  Eclipse in this state is really annoying to use and almost a show-stopper. This can be fixed in /etc/eclipse.ini to force it to use gtk2, but still annoying.  dnf is a pleasure to use. Love it and don't miss yum a single bit. Muscle memory is strong though and some of the new commands aren't that familiar yet (e.g dnf repoquery).   libinput is nice. my touchpad always was kind of finicky with synaptics, these things are more or less resolved now.  Somthing for the more adventurous among us: I started using the new dhcp system from NetworkManager by adding dhcp=internal in /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf. works fine so far and connecting seems to be faster.  My conclusion: This release is one of transitions. Many default or important applications are finally switching over to gtk3 (libreoffice will follow next release, I guess). Wayland sees some more testing, but still isn't fully there (As I said: fix c&p and I'm more or less sold).  All the integration stuff done by the Workstation crew is really appreciated. I didn't do any benchmarks, but it feels snappy and reactive.  I will definitely stay with Fedora, as it strikes the best balance between being up to date and integration to form a coherent whole.  Thanks to all, working on Fedora for making such a great distro.  P.S.: Not a native speaker, so apologies for any mistakes."

LinuxActionShow,37f90k,t_hunger,1 point,Wed May 27 18:08:47 2015 UTC,I think one official IDE which ships with SDK and other requirements should be the first priority because developer resources and time is limited.

LinuxActionShow,37f90k,t_hunger,0,Wed May 27 19:03:05 2015 UTC,Linux/Unix is an IDE. Vim or emacs is just one part of the IDE.
LinuxActionShow,37f90k,t_hunger,2,Wed May 27 12:58:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry, that is ignorant nonsense.  A proper IDE has a code model so that it understands your code just as a compiler does and integrates that data into all kinds of tools. That enables refactoring and whatnot that make a developer so much more productive.  Unix is an OS, vim and emacs are text editors, that can have all kinds of stuff bolted on. Yes, you can add a code model, yes you can add all kinds of tools. But you do not get code model and tools integrated with each other. That is not even half as useful.  Give a proper IDE a try for a while."
LinuxActionShow,37f90k,t_hunger,0,Wed May 27 16:22:14 2015 UTC,"Rather funny to call me ignorant. My job involves developing an admin interface for managing Linux SOEs in prisons. What do I use? Vim, sed, grep, find, etc.  Developing is my job.  I also contribute to a few open source projects. Take Xiphos as an example. It has quite a few lines of code. It uses GTK+ and WebKit. What do I use when working on it? Vim, sed, grep, gcc, etc.  I'm not ignorant. This is my work.  Yes I have used Xcode quite a bit. Yes it would be nice if there was something as good on Linux. But people miss the point.  Unix is an IDE.  People don't like that saying because they are not willing to learn how to use this great IDE.  Vim does not need any plugins. Just enable syntax highlighting; and remember: Vim is not an IDE, Unix is. People just need to learn the wonderful tools Unix has."
LinuxActionShow,37f90k,_AACO,3,Wed May 27 23:40:30 2015 UTC,"Just because something is your job does not guarantee that you can't be ignorant about certain aspects of that job. I am not saying that you are a bad programmer, just that you have no idea what an IDE is.  Many people in the FLOSS community are ignorant about IDEs, you are not alone in that:-) Brandishing that ignorance about is fashionable in our scene (""I am leet, I use vim, I am so much more productive that way because I can beat anyone in artificial benchmarks like deleting 76 consecutive lines"").  Plus there are very few free IDEs that actually are proper IDEs. Basically we have Eclipse (which I personally don't like to use), KDevelop and Qt Creator. All the others don't have a code model and thus are out. Maybe that explains why that particular ignorance is more widespread in the gnome world than in KDE -- at least in my experience: There is just no good gtk based IDE out there. Maybe Gnome Builder will change that at some point, but that is still far away."
LinuxActionShow,37f90k,_AACO,2,Thu May 28 05:38:59 2015 UTC,"Good answer.  I still hold to Unix being an IDE though.  However I think that some good IDEs are needed on Linux, I have played with Qt Creator and it seems good, but when you are used to vim, it is hard to use something else. I'm hoping GNOME Builder will be just as good too.  I do see the problem of people who are accustomed to using an IDE finding it hard when coming to Linux. But if we have good IDEs then perhaps it will bring some good software. That has certainly worked for OS X."

What they mean is that Android is not the same thing as ""GNU/Linux"".

Now there are some good eggs out there that realize and appreciate open source and give money to open source and Linux. But they are the minority along the line of the numbers of Linux Steam users 1%. That's 1% of total Linux or Open Source users that actually gives monies back to support the projects. Ohhh they can afford to buy that 3rd or 4th $5 Latte but can't be bothered to donate the cash of one of those to Open Source or Linux.  Wish I could give more cash. But being on very limited monthly income. Can't afford Cable TV or even a Cell phone. And don't go to coffee shops or even $5 for fast food order for me. And bugs the hell out of me that I can't give out $10 bucks here or $20 there on a regular basis. As been awhile since donating to projects for me.  .
LinuxActionShow,377mt4,H3g3m0n,2,Mon May 25 16:23:19 2015 UTC,"Are they cheap or is Mozilla just using the wrong strategy to get donations?  It's not likely that people will randomly go ""gee I should give this free browser some money"". And even if they consider it that have to find out how to go about doing that. And if they do that that will probably do it once and forget about it. Generally the effort required to give a donation is more of an issue for people than the donation itself.  Maybe if they put a single Mozilla sponsored tile that links to Patreon on the new tab page instead of a whole bunch of advertisements, it would have more financial effect than the advertisement revenue without and of the negativity. And it's a subscription model so its a continuous income stream. Maybe it could even unlock some badge or something that shows up in the browser.  I haven't really used Firefox for years now so I don't know if they have tried anything like that. From memory you just got a new tab on a major update that might have donations buried somewhere in there."
LinuxActionShow,377mt4,Orbmiser,1 point,Tue May 26 03:12:05 2015 UTC,Well wasn't talking Firefox specifically. Just the state of entitlement I see with many that use Open Source or Linux.

Compared to many I see willing to stand in line for 5 or 10 mins. for that Latte or VooDoo doughnut or Quarter Pounder with Cheese. But complain sitting at their computer when they may have to spend a minute or two extra digging to give a donation. Just doesn't add up to making sense to me.
LinuxActionShow,377mt4,H3g3m0n,1 point,Tue May 26 03:45:15 2015 UTC,People don't make sense. It doesn't make sense to assume they will. We are emotional beings. Basic psychology says that people formulate opinions and beliefs on things before they have the logic and reason to back that up. Sometimes people can have their opinions changed with reason but it has also been shown that people will actually dig in further. Strategies you formulate for should take reality into account.  The fact of the matter is even if I can ethically justify the advertisements to myself with logic and reason (really I'm on the fence). It doesn't change the fact that I hate advertising.  Of course I'm quite happily using Chrome despite it being produced by Google which claims to be an advertising company. Because logic and reason don't dictate my every action.

LinuxActionShow,377mt4,H3g3m0n,2,Tue May 26 01:39:09 2015 UTC,"I think the big issue with the Mozilla ads that the ethics, morals and whether or not something is justified won't really change the end result.  Humans don't make decisions by rational logic and reason. They formulate an option/belief on something then retroactively come up with reasons to support their position later without even realising they are doing so (as shown by studies on split-brain patients).  I have an aversion to advertising. I suspect many other people do too.  There are some reasons I have for backing that such as viewing most advertising as a form of mind control. After all the entire reason for it to exist is to get you to buy something you wouldn't have previously. Otherwise the advertising business model wouldn't work.  Its gotten to the point that they have neuromarketing where they put people in FMRI machines to find what triggers the regions of the brain to get they to buy stuff.  Some advertisements are not so bad when it is making you aware of something you wouldn't have known about previously and it is actually beneficial to have (as opposed to advertising something like a freemium mobile game that uses addiction strategies). Just about all ad companies claim they are ""providing a service to consumers by making them aware of goods and services"", a vast majority of the time that is just a bunch of spin.  You can also have an economy of ethics. Maybe advertisements are unethical, but if what is supported by the revenue is ethically positive to a than negative, then there is a positive net gain. The problem is that can run into a slippery slope issue where the advertising becomes more and more depended on and start to cause more ethical problems.  There is also a corrupting influence with money in anything.  Hopefully Mozilla will genuinely be trying to ensure ethically good advertisements. But we have been shown images of Microsoft and Apple. So an OpenSource project will be advertising closed proprietary software and companies that have a vested interest against a free and open web. What happens if they depend on the advertisements and Apple/Microsoft want Mozilla to support the patent encumbered HVEC instead of VP9?  As another example of the influence, could Jupiter Broadcasting really be considered unbiased while themselves being sponsored by advertising. Could I see a host taking a stance against Mozilla's decision.  I don't really view JB's advertising as unethical since they do seem to be decent products they themselves seem to use and things I could imagine them recommending to friend/family even without the sponsorship deals. And unlike Firefox, they are not a community OpenSource project. But I still dislike the advertisements and fast forward them (although if I ever have need of the products I would use the codes).  Or consider what has happened with MySQL (forked with MariaDB), Java (OpenJDK, Google lawsuits and a court ruling saying API's can be copyrighted), OpenOffice (now under Apache's wing, but not before it was forked into LibreOffice under the incompatible GPL).  It's also weird to see a not-for-profit foundation acting more like a company. It's not just the browser but also the smartphones, app store and so on.  As I said at the start, the reasons/justifications won't really matter, only how people view and react to the situation. If they hate it then people will start abandoning the browser and we will see some fork."

Unfortunately for Archs (I count also Antergos or Manjaro) users almost all are ubuntu based and there still isn't a Manjaro spin that would be great if KX Studio would make one, as you said at this episode, ffmpeg and other packages usually are better as newer in multimedia. So if you want an arch music production rig well configured you have to work it yourself step by step. Said that KX is migrating to debian RR but in a slow way.  Also Netrunner (not a studio one) is a very interesting distro because they have an Ubuntu based one, and a Manjaro based one (suggestion I made to them and they decided it was worthy to do so) and let the user decide if they want the ubuntu or the arch based version."

Even tough the system monitor might show they use about the same amount of resources, XFCE is much faster and responsive on old hardware.    I have no experience with iMacs so I don't know if the 2006 model has an Intel or PowerPC processor. If your iMac is equipped with an Intel chip then I would recommend Xubuntu 14.04. Unfortunately Xubuntu 14.04 does not have a build for the PowerPC architecture, so if it is the case that your iMac is equipped with such a chip Xubuntu is not an option. Maybe try Debian."
LinuxActionShow,379vwe,mspadaru,1 point,Tue May 26 15:30:16 2015 UTC,If you are looking for stability and light I would go with Debian Jessie with either XFCE or LXDE (if you like Ubuntu then you go with Xubuntu or Lubuntu). MATE is a bit heavier but I would definitely put it in the lightweight category. I am running Debian Testing(Strech) on an old iBook G4 PPC. It runs pretty well.

LinuxActionShow,379vwe,Mikerr89,1 point,Tue May 26 21:14:15 2015 UTC,"I guess any linux distro should work with old hardware. Ideally one chooses distro per utility and willingness to invest time in a distro with one's own apetite for customizations (desktops, fonts, themes, apps, configs etc).  From your choices: here are some thoughts 1. Bodhi vs Arch. Bodhi basically is enlightenment desktop (which you can install on Arch) plus Arch will give you newest kernel which Bodhi might give you Ubuntu 14.04 base (which may or may not be stable depending on what you do with it). You can always convert your Ubuntu installation to Bodhi (but then you are duplicating effort that Bodhi team already did). 2. Ubuntu MATE vs Arch. Again you are essentially comparing an Ubuntu base vs Arch (which can install freshest cinnamon without any issues). 3. Arch vs Manjaro vs Antergos - all have same underlying philosophy. As I personally observe Arch wiki a better source of info.... I would recommend Antergos for installation experience.  With your choice of Apps or tasks.. 1. All distros should be able to connect with wifi (regardless of desktop environment and/or choice of default wifi application). On Arch perhaps you can get longer list of apps to manage it systemd-network manager, gnome's network manager applet, netctl, wicd... Pick any one and stick with it. 2. Reliable boot -- GRUB should take care of this (as your hardware is not expected to have any UEFI) regardless of distro 3. Regular apps .. all distro should give you these apps... just that with Arch and its derivatives (Manjaro and Antergos) you stand to get latest versions easily in the core operating system and are not a hostage of ppas.  Mostly you are looking at Ubuntu base or Arch base. Systemd was there on Arch since ages. Ubuntu just started integrating this, and it could be an issue for you if you are searching for specific issues where you need systemd scripts but Ubuntu docs might or might not be upto date with that info. Ubuntu is a great distro, no doubt. It is just what you prefer to have... Arch bases claim to give you fresh software (and it is 100 times more stable than Chris claims on air) while under Ubuntu camp you essentially are with the most popular distro.  Please note.. your desktop manager (Englightenment, Gnome, KDE) can be changed (easily under Arch, not so easily under other distros depending on availability or lack of of quality ppas), and mostly that will make or break your first experience. As you get past look and feel, you might want to stick with a base that you are comfortable with.  Long story short - if you have used Ubuntu, stick to it. If you have used Arch and are comfortable with that, stick to it :)"
LinuxActionShow,379vwe,las_feedback,1 point,Tue May 26 07:20:33 2015 UTC,"In continuation of earlier train of thought  Current OpenSUSE... (basically Debian + KDE)...clever choice! Choices..  Bodhi... (Debian via Ubuntu + Enlightenment).. if you like KDE you might not like this.  Ubuntu MATE (basically Debian via Ubuntu + Cinnamon)... you are coming into old style Gnome desktop.. if you liked KDE, it is 50-50 you might like this.  Arch/Manjaro/Antergos (basically these are identical triplets). Antergos is only a new (easy and shining) installer on Arch plus Gnome 3 desktop. Manjaro is very similar to Arch (still it is not Arch).  As I said earlier desktop look and feel will be first acid test for you... you can try each one of Gnome3, KDE, Enlightenment, Cinnamon, Xfce, Lxde (why not) easily under Arch without need for reinstallation (same should be with Manjaro and Antergos). It might not be that easy under dedicated Ubuntu (or debian) derivatives.  If you can fix a hardware problem easily under openSUSE (which is really a debian base), you should be able to fix these problems under Ubuntu MATE, Bodhi theoretically (but not really due to distro specific nuances). Typically if you are on newest kernel, you will be in safer zone. Any version of software has bugs (and unfortunately it includes kernel). Under Arch, if it is that big an issue, you can see that issue will get resolved very quickly (ref forums).   Coming back to Desktops.. As of today, I notice, under Arch, KDE is under transition with the QT4 vs QT5 (I might be wrong here). As you are from KDE camp basically (openSUSE), you might not like the transition (or perhaps will be more accommodative to transition knowing which components are changing). But then you are willing to change openSUSE means perhaps you want to try something that is not KDE.  From polish perspective Gnome 3 will give you more appeal than enlightenment and/or Cinnamon. But the fact that you want to play some games, you can keep underlying system very light weight (despite choice of desktop) under Arch to spare resources to gaming, this may or may not be true with Ubuntu derivatives.  If I were you, I would try out various desktop environments first to be comfortable with look and feel. My observation is people from KDE camp tend to stick with KDE, and Gnome 3 camp tend to stick with Gnome 3 and so on."

Caused by their different name length.  I'm sure you've tried the other possibilities that I am thinking of and this may be the best solution.  Fine.   It is meant to be 3d folds, why reconsider?   It seemed like a flat design and the 3d doesn't seem to sit right to me.  At first I thought it was ribbon skeuomorph (the way they are cut at an angle).  Then I decided it was 3d and the front is meant to be sloping away (opposite angles on each side).  But the perspective is off (the inside angle of the orange pieces should be shallower).  So as they aren't tilted away (they cant be as the logo is circular and face-on), they are really not square.  That's fine, but I would drop the little dark orange triangles that hint at the 3d shape.  It would look simpler and I think more effective.  Then you could also make the cut angles suit the font on each side, perhaps.  Anyway, just my thoughts on seeing it.  Other than my OCPD nitpicks I really like it.

It is not meant to be ""flat design"", it has flat elements but it isn't just flat and honestly I can't stand designs that are ""flat only"".

I've dealt with this on Debian twice now where the upgrade killed the zfs install. Never takes more than 5 minutes to fix now that I know what breaks."

Both options remembered the current state of the now playing playlist, and added the song to the playlist.

That being said, the MediaMonkey feature you're describing sounds terrific! I immediately checked whether Clementine could do the same thing, unfortunately it only queues the track at the end of the now playing playlist and after the song you're listening to is over, it will immediately jump to the newly added song, but since it is at the end, the playlist will either end after the song's over or start at the beginning (if on repeat) instead of going back to the next track in the playlist.

It is, however, the one distribution best poised for mass acceptance. But for that to happen, the entire Linux and open source community needs to get behind the effort. That does not mean, in any way, that we all need to turn our backs on our distribution of choice; it only means joining the effort to get the one flavor of Linux with the best chance at mass acceptance in front of the masses. Once that goal is accomplished, maybe that distribution you love so much will enjoy its deserved moment in the spotlight.   You may not like Canonical or Ubuntu, but at least recognize that it is a very powerful force, that can bring us a lot of places. Instead of trying to stop the bull, guide it towards where you think it should go. Work with them to make sure other distro's aren't fucked, and enjoy the momentum they are able to create."

LinuxActionShow,36wchi,krnekhelesh,7,Sat May 23 16:20:48 2015 UTC,"I know you are just trying to explain the meaning behind Aaron Seigo's statement there, but let me take the time to explain that Ubuntu Touch development is in no way similar to Android's development. Android development is done behind closed doors and then they bring out a huge release which is then open-sourced. Contrary to that every OTA update that Canonical has released up to this point has done out in the open. If you hangout in freenode irc channels like #ubuntu-touch, #ubuntu-app-devel etc, you can follow the development live literally.  FYI, I am one of the many community core app developers (Clock App) and I have had the opportunity at various occasions to inject requests, code contributions to the Ubuntu SDK right from the start. So Aaron's statement that they developed their own QML API and mobile UX behind closed doors is absolute bullshit. The Canonical Community team has been open right from the start by hosting Community Q&A, Ubuntu Engineering Team Updates Google Live Hangout sessions where they try their best to keep the community involved on what's currently being worked on. This is all in addition to the standard form of communication which include the ubuntu touch mailing list.  Every piece of software that is shipped on the Ubuntu Touch Phone is open to community development and I have noticed several community members who work alongside Canonical developers on important things like ubuntu-sdk, browser app. May be to the outside community, it might seem like things are done behind closed doors, but that is certainly not the case.  You guys should check out this awesome talk by Michael Hall at Scale 13x https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi9OnotrDX4 where he shows how Canonical has learnt a lot from its mistakes in the past and has been engaging more and more with the community since then.  Note: Just to be clear, I am just a community developer involved in Ubuntu Touch with no official affiliation with Canonical.  Edit: Fixed some grammatical errors."

I would not do that, if I made something that I want to be kept free I won't give it over to someone else to use and licensese under a proprietary license, that would be a stupid thing to do...

They want the freedom to use the code that one's writing in some way that isn't compatible with the way that one has chosen to license the code, which means they want to use it in some way that I wouldn't approve of in the first place, why even give it a license then?  If I get paid that is something else, then the people can have the code and the license as much as they want to, since they pay for the code, but if I'm contributing something, I want to at least have a say in how my code is getting spread (or not). If I feel MIT is good, I'll license it under that, if I believe in GPL I'll license it under that, because I want the code to be spread, I don't get what's so hard to understand about that."

Ubuntu is a multi-millionaire geek's hobby. Financially is by far the most independent desktop distribution, which means that it can finance its own development.

I've been using linux since about Redhat Linux 7 (NOT the enterprise edition). I used Ubuntu for a very long time during my stay as a Linux user, and I gotta say the one thing Ubuntu likes to goof up are the updates and upgrades. There's a reason why the Linux Mint guys have just given up and told people to just nuke and pave. All that is well and good for private use for people who know what they are doing, but in production or for light users it's absolutely unacceptable. I'm not saying software should be perfect, because that's impossible, but we need some sort of predictability with updates if we are to be considered seriously for an option for these use cases.   This IS a problem. Let's not kid ourselves, this is a major problem for adoption and in my experience with deploying workstations, Arch definitely handles updates more gracefully. The trade off is I have to take more responsibility for the initial configuration and maintenance.  I do think these problems will sort themselves out, though. Snappy Core is on it's way and if the desktop developers for Ubuntu implement those features well in the desktop iterations of Ubuntu they might win me over again.    Chris has also been having issues with PulseAudio, which are incredibly frustrating if you're working in production. This is a problem that is frustrating in general, and I think we as a community could do well by figuring out creative ways to fund more development with PulseAudio to sort some of this out."

Given all the douche moves that Canonical does, for the sake of promoting their brand, the author thinks everyone should forget all this and elect Ubuntu as a champion for the whole community. e  IMHO, Canonical is only reaping what they sow.

LinuxActionShow,36wchi,phearus-reddit,8,Sat May 23 01:10:45 2015 UTC,"Respectfully, I disagree. Wallen is more clear-minded about the realities of the Linux landscape, and the importance of corporate backing. Money and marketing make a difference. @chrislas alluded to this in his rant on the most recent LUP where he argued that having money to fly developers in is a distinct advantage over smaller distributions. I'd love to see all open-source enthusiasts get behind one, or two, of the distributions with the best chance for success. Success starts with momentum; momentum that Canonical undeniably has."
LinuxActionShow,36wchi,galgalesh,1 point,Sat May 23 01:29:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing with you, just need to play the devils advocate here for a second... You talk about Canonical's momentum with Ubuntu. Was this before or after they put desktop Linux on the back burner for other things? I mean, you want to talk about squandering momentum - this is probably the best example of it. One more point - fix the software centre. The fact that this mess has been festering for how long now only proves how committed to the desktop Canonical really are. You can talk about how they are going to change this in the future - I will believe it when I see it.  I think this article is a little confused over why Canonical and Ubuntu get disrespect from the community at large.  I think Ubuntu is the best opportunity Linux has for mass desktop Linux adoption. It really riles me up to see how it has been delegated to maintenance mode in the last few years. Let's all hope this talk about desktop love actually comes into being."
LinuxActionShow,36wchi,TheGoodManJohnFarson,10,Sat May 23 01:27:29 2015 UTC,"tl;dr They are using their momentum to win the next round, instead of succeeding on a platform with decreasing relevancy  For two-three years, they didn't do major changes on the desktop side, because they were working on the convergent stuff (that work is paying off big now, btw, having a convergent platform *before** microsoft..)*. They got a lot of fud for stagnating. Now:   In those two years, their success has kept growing and they already launched the two first fully free GNU/Linux phones. Now they want to use the tools they have been developing in the past two years to unify Linux packages and stop the dependency mess. The software center will be replaced by the app store from the phone    You can talk about how they are going to change this in the future - I will believe it when I see it.   You see what you want to see. To have released two commercial phones. To be the leader in cloud. To be making the convergent story at the same time as their proprietary competitors. That is changing the future to me. At the very least, they have raised the bar a lot for the competition.   it has been delegated to maintenance mode   They had two options:   Make the desktop perfect and lose mobile (and the future desktop) Innovate to have a head start at winning the next round   We lost this round. Making a perfect desktop at a time when the desktop is becoming less relevant is a bad move. More yet: This is something other communities can do. GNOME and KDE are making perfect desktops, without Canonicals help. However, nobody is making a mobile/convergent platform."
LinuxActionShow,36wchi,mhall119,3,Sat May 23 03:40:09 2015 UTC,"Good points. And I agree with you. The software center is a mess.   When I say momentum, I'm speaking in terms of consumer mind-share. Stock Ubuntu is commonly the first distro recommended to beginners. And pretty much the only Linux distro marketed to consumers by the likes of Dell or HP. This is because Canonical can pay their Marketing/Advertising departments to interface with their counter-parts at these conglomerates.  Apple overtook Microsoft by following the same line of logic: mind-share begets market-share.  This is highly speculative, but I feel Canonical is putting desktop on the back-burner precisely for the right reasons: mobile users make up a growing percentage of online users. Especially in emerging markets. Get consumers hooked on your UX at the mobile level, and they'll be comfortable purchasing your desktop/laptop variants as well.   Again, Apple used this same strategy with the iPhone. Most hipster tech writers picked up a MacBook only AFTER they had their first or second iPhone.   I think Canonical plans to come back to the desktop in a big way. But as you stated, we'll just have to wait and see..."

I was not very interested in leaking all my DNS requests to them though.  The solution was really easy. I created a network namespace (those are used by containers/jails to have a different network stack inside of the guest) i have created a veth device inside of the network namespace and then bridged it with my hosts wlan0 device.  veth devices are always pairs. One inside of the namespace and one outside. Those two are connected with each other, that is how you can connect a guests ethernet device with the hosts device.  Then i created a new resolveconf in /etc/netns/$NSNAME/resolve.conf (where $NSNAME was netflix) and added the providers nameservers.

The first weekend after i set it up, things just ground to a halt as a dozen different computers, mobiles, tablets and games consoles had their http traffic forced through the proxy at the same time.  I've done it successfully in the past, but my connection speed was much lower and there were only a few devices on the network then.  Since i have an always-on FreeNAS box on the network i just created a jail and installed both Squid and Privoxy there.  Privoxy acts as a parent proxy for Squid.  So Privoxy strips out any ads before passing the content on to Squid, which does caching.  Unfortunately the FreeBSD Squid package isn't compiled with support for intercept so can't be used as a transparent proxy as is.  I might recompile it with support at some point, but for now i've just set my webserver up to serve a proxy auto config file which directs browsers through the proxy."

My problem stemmed from all the devices not needing to go through the proxy being forced through there.  The version of Privoxy in OpenWrt Barrier Breaker is also pretty old, and you have to add the oldpackages repo to get it.  In Chaos Calmer (and in the recently released RC1 for it) Privoxy has been updated and moved back to the officially supported packages repo.

LinuxActionShow,36sq3i,JRRS,1 point,Fri May 22 17:34:27 2015 UTC,"If Canonical were to go public it would be interesting as we would have more accurate reports on the financial status of the company. Right now the best we have is some statements here and there by Mark about the profitability of the cloud department and a few leaked documents on the web.  It seems the strategy Mark chose was to build this story of growth and potential for his company instead of a company with some stable yearly earnings, healthy returns on working capital and sustainable growth. Usually that type of IPOs happen in a period of a bull market (like the one we currently are in) where IPOs are hundreds times more frequent and investors are optimistic and tend to go where the hype is (towards some growth companies in 'cool' sectors), like in IoT, Cloud, smartphones etc..  Usually most of these companies don't deliver up to the high expectations that rise from the hype and the overconfidence. They tend to have an initial spike in market price after the IPO when they're hot but afterwards when time passes by and their underperformance becomes apparent in comparison to the expectations they freeze and their market price falls at the bottom. This high fluctuation in market prices occurs because most of the investors in that type of companies value growth and potential future earnings and the market changes its opinion frequently (and abruptly) about these things.  Now all that on my part is highly speculative because currently I don't have precise financial data about Canonical and of course I don't know at what price the IPO will happen or other details (e.g. which part of it will be new shares issued so that it would raise money for Canonical to use, or which part will be sold from  Mark's ownership) but that's how I currently perceive it based on the indications I currently have.  tl;dr: Personally I believe it's a good timing for Canonical to do this and raise capital in order to finance better its operations, I don't believe though it's a very good timing or type of investment for the investors themselves :D"

LinuxActionShow,36u4bi,Infinity040,1 point,Fri May 22 12:23:12 2015 UTC,Our system is more complex than that. We have multiple libraries and we use pfsense as a wifi gateway with a captive portal.

For several years now we have had inotify and it is a pretty elegant and efficient solution. I first used it in a script for a web based mp3 player. Basically I allowed random people to insert a usb stick, it would detect any mp3s on it, copy it to a music directory, scan rename and catoegorise them by artist and album name and then copy them to a playlist  directory where inotify immediately informed the web server / php to rescan the directory and get it listed on the webpage. For a stick with about 20 songs on it this wold take about 5 seconds. People were chuffed.  But these days surely no program than needs to sync stuff would ever need to scan a directory more than once. You scan it once, and wait for any notifications of file changes."

It replaces an earlier facility, dnotify, which had similar goals.  Inotify was created by John McCutchan,  and it was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 2.6.13, released on August 29, 2005;  later kernel versions included further improvements. The required library interfaces were added into the GNU C Library (glibc) in its version 2.4, released in March 2006, while the support for inotify was completed in glibc version 2.5, released in September 2006.   One major use is in desktop search utilities like Beagle, where its functionality permits reindexing of changed files without scanning the filesystem for changes every few minutes, which would be very inefficient. By being told directly by the kernel that a file has changed, indexing utilities can achieve change-to-reindexing times of only about a second.

I couldn't even get the server to complete a scan though so after about a week or two of letting it chug along I killed it and went back to a different solution. I would try to figure out if there was something in a folder causing it to continuously scan but the folders are matched on the server and my laptop and my laptop certainly stopped after a few hours.

LinuxActionShow,36onx9,ChrisLAS,2,Thu May 21 15:28:48 2015 UTC,"Well that does count Debian out then. You were pretty much right then the easiest things to do would be either Ubuntu with shittons of PPAs or Arch and we all saw how Ubuntu has been.   BTW, aliasing something like 'upp' to make an LVM snapshot before doing an upgrade would probably be a good way to lessen your anxiety of running Arch on a mission critical machine."
LinuxActionShow,36onx9,StannisIsMyKing,1 point,Thu May 21 02:49:57 2015 UTC,If it's about maybe losing audio or video or mounting issues on the machine you could also just install linux-lts and nvidia-lts next to the main packages. Copy & Paste your boot entry add -lts to the kernel image and initrd. Voilá. Since modules all have their own path in /usr/lib/modules there is no risk of running into any conflicts with this setup and you can just switch at boot if you get hit with something like the btrfs deadlock a few weeks ago. It will just fall back to the other kernel and initrd and pick up the -lts modules from their directory which are updated and curated in the main repos just like the main kernel is.
LinuxActionShow,36onx9,blackout24,2,Thu May 21 13:12:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Arch + LTS kernel is my current setup since Tuesday."
LinuxActionShow,36onx9,ChrisLAS,2,Thu May 21 15:29:26 2015 UTC,"But you're using ArchLinux, a distro that by its own definition uses bleeding edge packages.  With a higher risk because it haves a smaller testing team than Debian.  With many AUR packages installed (some of those key system components or production software) that the only testing you have is the good will of the packager.  So come again with that safe bet thing."
LinuxActionShow,36onx9,JRRS,1 point,Thu May 21 15:52:33 2015 UTC,"Run Debian stable, but grab the packages you need through backports.   Backports are testing packages, compiled for stable. Should work for you, if testing is new enough."

Chris replied elsewhere that the need for updated versions of several applications makes these distros non-options.  That's really the fundamental problem we have here:  If you need updated apps on Linux, you have to run a bleeding-edge operating system.  Wouldn't it be nice if we didn't have to make that choice?  At work I have a vm running a six-year-old version of Windows.  I can install the latest stable releases of almost any Windows application on it.  Can you imagine trying to run the latest version of anything on Ubuntu 9.04,  OpenSuse 11, or Fedora 12?  Wouldn't it be great if we could run something as solid as Debian Wheezy with current releases of our applications?"
LinuxActionShow,36onx9,lykwydchykyn,2,Thu May 21 05:00:15 2015 UTC,Which is why I'm really interested to see how the Ubuntu Snappy stuff in 15.10 plays out. Little bit of extra disk space is well worth this kind of flexibility. I'm not really a Ubuntu fan but if they pull it off it's going to be very compelling.
LinuxActionShow,36onx9,Qizmett,2,Thu May 21 07:31:00 2015 UTC,I agree. The only reason why people are pissed that they are making a distro that isn't put together like we used to put together distros for the past 15 years is because it's new. There is this stupid technofear and fear of change in the Linux community. They seem to think that only because something has been that way for 10 years means we found some kind of holy grail in the past. Same applies to the Sys V init vs. systemd debate.

My laptop isn't an embedded device and shoudn't be treated like one.  Sure, I like the idea of being able to rollback changes if things go awry. But this isn't the answer to that.

Having said that, Fedora has really matured into a first rate desktop distribution over the last few releases. A lot of work went into that, most of it paid for by Red Hat. Their more restrictive approach to ""non-free"" or IP-encumbered components in their own repos is apparently a show stopper for a lot of people, but that' why diversity in the market is a good thing."
LinuxActionShow,36n62i,Job_5_Verse_7,8,Wed May 20 16:38:34 2015 UTC,"I'll just add from my experience. Fedora doesn't have VirtualBox guest additions are part of OS updates the way Ubuntu and openSUSE do. Font rendering in Fedora is not as good as Ubuntu out of the box. A lot of 3rd party software and instructions are not geared toward Fedora. Chromium is not part of the official repos.  A lot of proprietary hardware drivers are more easily available in Ubuntu than in Fedora. I had a Broadcom WiFi card a few years ago and every time I updated the kernel I had to wait for RPMFusion to catch up to get it to work.  Fedora 22 is a great step forward in focus and execution. It's still missing a lot of things that make my life easier. So for now I'm sticking with Ubuntu, upgrading every release."

Can't do that in openSUSE 13.2 GNOME Shell because it's older.

Even just pulling in chromium. chromium stopped working for me when running the sid version last time I tryed it. honestly I don't like having to eggshell updates. testing is mostly fine with the rare inconvenient bug here or there which can be solved with apt pinning and pulling in from stable or sid when you run into issues. if software is getting a really cool feature and you want it now you can just pull it from experimental. Apt pinning is what really makes debian my go to distro. Freedom to choose between stability and bleeding edge is super nice. Some software is stable from upstream release.

But add in newer systems,proprietary drivers and then in Chris situation specific functions.   That are more unique as in production audio & video needs compared to the general user needs makes for a more problematic stable and fresh system. I ran into this situation when I added a Huion graphics tablet for digital drawing and art.  Now I was required to have the later kernels and latest applications versions that supported my tablet like Krita,Gimp,etc...   And had to move from Debian based SolydXK debian testing to Manjaro based Netrunner arch rolling based to get what I needed.  Well graphics tablet support in Linux is abysmal and problematic. Especially trying to use a graphics tablet on a dual display system.   I imagine in Chris's case is for unique setups he needs for production where his case isn't well tested for a more professional studio type setup.  Just guessing here and maybe something totally different. But my was my experiences.  As to Fedora my experiences was more negative about the installer and getting it installed. But that was back in 18? 19? Surprised me as listening to it right now. But no thread started in LAS announcing it so we can chime in there.

LinuxActionShow,36n62i,blackout24,2,Wed May 20 20:09:03 2015 UTC,True about unplugged not needing it's own sub-reddit. But been seeing a long 1 or 2 day delay posting the show here. Which leaves out discussions after watching the show.  Can't comment on Fedora as haven't done any real world use. But do notice and experienced the fine line between stability vs. need of bleeding edge. And the wide variance of different distro's failing or meeting those needs. Meeting the needs then something goes wrong on updates 3 or 6 months in makes for an uneasy alliance for serious work where stability needs to be rock solid. And not just for a month or three or six. Then goes off the rails kind of scenario.

I don't want my distros devoid of ideology (the politics is just a side-effect), but it's a matter of balance.  There are distros that say ""We dare not make it easy for users to install proprietary software, because then they might and we'd be bad people for seemingly encouraging that"".  There are others that say ""We'll just chuck all in the proprietary stuff that we assume people need, and not bother mentioning it.""  In between there are those who say ""We'll make it possible, and reasonably simple, to install proprietary software, but we won't do it by default and we will make sure the user understands on some level that this is not free software.""  I prefer something in the neighborhood of the last approach.  By all means tell me when I'm installing nonfree software; pop up a warning with flashing text and an animated PNG of RMS waggling his finger at me.

I doubt RedHat and Fedora are chasing the same users and customers as Canonical. Note that the primary Fedora release is called ""Workstation"".

LinuxActionShow,36n62i,xoo-,4,Wed May 20 18:14:07 2015 UTC,How many Unity users think they're running a workstation?   Probably quite a lot.
LinuxActionShow,36n62i,blackout24,2,Wed May 20 18:17:00 2015 UTC,"This is a really important point (about indemnification). It's much easier to persuade management to allow the use of open source when there's a vendor with substantial resources behind it promising to stand beside you (anyone who doesn't think there's still a lot of anti ""freeware"" sentiment in enterprise IT is fooling themselves -- Microsoft, Oracle, IBM and even Sun's early FUD campaigns are still having an impact two decades on, even if many of those companies have themselves turned the corner).  Red Hat is also particularly at risk in being headquartered in the US, where it is at least theoretically subject to much a much harsher intellectual property regime than its competitors (of course they all do business in the US, so it's unlikely any of them could escape the jurisdiction of a US court if push came to shove).  As a systems architect with a big US based multinational, I appreciate Red Hat's effort to keep its products free of encumbrances.  It makes my job a lot easier when the auditors come calling (and they DO come calling).   If I want to have any truly open source software Red Hat has chosen not to ship I can get it. Many projects make their software available via their own yum repos, or as downloadable rpms. The OpenSuSE's Build Service has also been a reliable resource.  But as you wrote, joncr, there's a sense that the audiences for Fedora and Ubuntu are different. Without disparaging anyone's personal preferences, over and over again my experience has been that a lot of the guys who run Fedora on their laptops and desktops at home are people who run RHEL in the data center at work. In my career that relationship has proven very practical. For example, being able to master systemd on Fedora before it was released as part of RHEL 7 was a huge advantage. So as I noted in another comment above, having to use a tarball to install the latest Blender, or copying the ffmpeg static binaries to my personal workstation at home, really isn't that big a deal. Heck, I sometimes even enjoy compiling stuff from source. Unless it's motion."

LinuxActionShow,36pne5,anthony_barker,7,Thu May 21 03:05:07 2015 UTC,"First some notes: Crippling Nautilus was a gnome decision that Ubuntu was not happy with at all... It is for that reason that they are still using an old Nautilus release, because the new one is even more crippled...  Second, Linux has been a lot of things, but not KISS. Even the newer unix's were not KISS anymore... The Gnome approach with cripling Nautilus is actually a lot more like KISS. They consider regular Linux programs to complex. That's also the reason behind removing the minimize button, they argue that minimizing is manual memory management, and isn't smth normal users should do.  To be clear, they are not moving off .deb files. If you want to keep using normal Ubuntu and install stuff using apt-get, you can. All the snappy work will be done on a seperate Ubuntu spin. It will be decided by the community if and when the default Ubuntu will switch to that. Even when they switch the default over, you will be able to just flick a switch to enable apt and .deb packages... The snappy way still uses apt and .deb packages internally, however it will not be exposed to the end user by default because they argue that apt and .deb packages break things to easily, which I agree on.  If you want to switch, go ahead. But please inform yourself better and don't throw around false accusations and buzzwords..."

An interface should show what a user wants to see and nothing more. An interface should allow the user to do what needs to be done and nothing more. We are in the 21th century. Computers can decide for their own whether or not an app needs to be closed or minimized. This should not be done by the user, but by the computer, hence: remove that button.

My solution to that problem is that I am a Debian user. I have to admit, though, I have recently switched the firewall on our campus from a linux-based distro (Smoothwall) to a FreeBSD-based one (pfsense) and have been pretty impressed with the results. Additionally, I moved all of our backups and file shares to FreeNAS from Debian servers and have had nothing but love for it. Despite, that, I do realize *BSD on the desktop has a long way to go, hence the jest.

LinuxActionShow,36m27a,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Wed May 20 16:27:42 2015 UTC,Fedora is the desktop version of RedHat so it will be very similar in many ways while still being a bit different. Arch is not really remotely similar to RedHat. ok then depending on experience you may be able to manage Arch without much hassle. If you are looking for a Workstation distro similar to RedHat then there is only one real option and that is Fedora. Arch is a rolling release distro as in that all packages are constantly updated as fast as possible. This means that even vital packages like the Linux kernel will be updated quite frequently compared to other distros that are months if not years behind the current stable releases. This is a good thing for people who are experienced with Linux because there is a lot of management involved and you have to keep up with the updates fairly frequently as in every couple days.
LinuxActionShow,36ld3d,pinkpooj,2,Wed May 20 06:11:43 2015 UTC,"I consider tmux to be an essential part of my workflow.  Session management is where tmux really shines; you can effortlessly set up and switch between sessions with a simple keybinding. I typically have one session open per ""project"" that I'm working on, each with its own set of windows and split panes, and it's a huge benefit to be able to reattach to those sessions from both work and home and seamlessly resume what I was doing (without doing any X11 forwarding or VNC shenanigans).  As I've been using tmux, I steadily find more and more features that it has that continue to reaffirm how awesome it is. The man page is very thorough and well worth a read to get familiar with all the useful features tmux has.  Of course, screen is also an option that I've used in the past, but screen cannot hold a candle to tmux in terms of features. The main problem that I have with screen is that screen can only remember the split pane layout while you're attached to the session. As soon as you detach and the reattach, bye bye split pane layout. This is just one of the many symptoms that screen is not a healthy code base. The only use case that I have for screen these days is if I need to connect to a serial console device on the local machine. Other than that one function, I can't think of a single reason to use screen over tmux.  Tmux ftw :D"

This bug affects Ubuntu proper and Ubuntu Mate, and probably other spinoffs too that I don't use. It's been present since at least 14.04, if not longer.  In summary: The ttf-mscorefonts-installer gets installed as a dependency of many super-common packages such as ubuntu-restricted-extras and Wine. Practically every Ubuntu user will run into this bug if they install anything from the Software Center.

LinuxActionShow,36byeo,wander_homer,17,Mon May 18 03:43:45 2015 UTC,"I really don't get the rant about John Carmacks talk. id Software has been one of the few companies which supported Linux years before Valve and others did and apparently that didn't pay well enough. He never said that ""Linux users won't pay for software"" but that there just wasn't enough people who did. And that's indeed what I as a free software developer am complaining about for years. Take a look at Ardour, probably the best free DAW out there and a really great piece of software, and still the developer is struggeling to make a living with it: https://community.ardour.org/node/8288  We are about to loose him to a company which pays him to develop proprietary software, only because we don't appreciate the hard work enough. This just sucks. And by looking at the Steam numbers, Windows for gaming isn't dying and Linux isn't growing. At best both have stable market share, at worst (looking at the current numbers) Windows is growing and Linux is ""dying"".  So instead of making John Carmack or Occulus look stupid by not seeing the great potential Linux offers, or predicting the death of Windows, we really should accept that criticism and find more ways how software developers can make a living with OSS and encourage more Linux users to pay for software. Furthermore we should be more critical with every aspect of Linux, only this way we know better about our shortcomings an can work on them, to make Linux a better experience."

DirectX vs. OpenGL.  PSP, PS2, Dreamcast, GameCube, Wii, PSX...Anything remotely modern is slow, ugly, and buggy on Linux compared to what is offered by DirectX 11 video libraries for these emulators. Many of the emulators ARE available on Linux, but they are basically unusable.   I am doing a Let's Play series of a PS2 game and use an emulator to upscale the game so it's nicer for my viewers to watch. As far as video capture goes I could absolutely use OBS to get the job done, but there is absolutely no way I could run the emulator on Linux. This is really frustrating but I know there's basically nothing that can be done until Vulcan comes out and HOPEFULLY is at least competitive with DX12. At that point maybe we'll see the emulator devs jump ship from DX and create great multi-platform plugins. For the moment Linux is second-class at best.  This is even more irritating because for those who want to make an emulator box, something like OpenELEC would be MUCH better than using Windows, which lacks customization options and basically is just a pain to use.  Sigh...Anyhow, you guys only seem to care about emulation of old systems so I guess you don't care about the cutting edge stuff and I guess it works for you, but here's a word of warning for those who do care about it."

It's worth fighting, sure, but let's not kid ourselves: Linux is FAR from being a good business decision yet. Personally, it's stupid of the Occulus folks to not deliver a product to EVERYONE that has backed them, regardless of OS. It sucks when a small indie game promises Linux support and doesn't deliver, but Occulus with more support and funding than ever 'pausing' their Linux support makes no sense."

Could you mention some of the benefits of squashfs for flash storage, eg vastly reduced inode usage.    SFS are good for reads, not for writes.  Due to the compression used, you effectively need to use SFS as a 'write once' but read often type of storage.  So its good for programs that the files arent going to change.  Any 'changes' can be saved in your personal save layer.  Now the save file being a special type of SFS that gets written ever [insert time period here], does extend flash life.  I have puppy on an old 4gb USB flash stick that's been daily used since 2008, and I still have no errors on the drive.  It's really not rocket science, if I have my save file set to write every hour, since there's 24 hours in a day, that's 24 writes per day.       Does Puppy Linux follow the ""one application per task"" philosophy, like a lot of minimalistic ""fit-on-a-cd"" distros, or not? Do the wiki pages and website recommend lightweight options for each category of software? I know the distro ships with 1 (lightweight) window manager and 1 file manager, but you talk about installing both firefox and chrome.    The release ISOs do indeed try to follow that philosophy, what someone else does with it once they have it is up to them.  The wiki is kind of a mess sadly, we dont really have many people willing to work on it.  Our community is rather small, so getting people to try to do more than they already are, is tough.   ""Puppy works off shell scripts... all you need to know is bash"". I think you would see a performance increase, at least during the system boot up, from using dash instead of bash. Is migrating to dash on the ""to do"" list?    To my knowledge that is on no  ones to-do list.   How much work is involved in getting woof to support another distro - weeks, months or years? I'm interested in building my own Puppy from binaries I've compiled on Gentoo Linux. Willing to contribute if it takes weeks or months, but I'd lose interest if it takes more than a year of work.    It depends on the skill level of the person doing the work.  We had someone who was responsible for making an ARM based Gentoo puppy, and I think he only spent a few weeks on it.  We dont usually get many Gentoo guys in our community though. What it would require is figuring out the list of packages needed for a minimal system, and then tweaking the shell scripts if the binaries or PATHs are different.  I'd say its not 'hard' work, but somewhat tedious."

That doesn't mean that I agree with his assessment...hell, I find that article to be incredibly boring. On the other hand, your attempt to insult someone at so many different levels and so definitively is irresponsible at best. If you actually showed any strong evidence to support your insults, I wouldn't have a problem...but as it stands, what you did there is just low.

What you just said is not a sufficient condition to being racist. You can certainly infer his position (of superiority) from what he writes, but to me it seems more productive to take his word when he says that he believes that looking at facts will help stop racism. He clearly presents himself as not racist, why not give him the benefit of the doubt? Even if what he says was inherently racist, his positioning himself on the non-racist category is worth something. Rather than attacking him after reading a blog entry, starting a discussion would be more productive. Hell, even not saying anything is more productive.  But I should note, the big deal is not just about calling him a racist, it is about all the negative attributes that you gave him...whether it is all warranted.  On the note on evidence, my problem is not that it is non-existent. It may very well be. But you make a very serious attack on a person and you don't even directly link to the articles in question (evidence), you just point to his blog...as if I have to scavenge to prove your point. Maybe they are easy to find on his blog, but I would say that if you are going to attack someone like that, it is your moral duty to show that you are not just being nasty, and that he truly deserves to be presented as such.  I don't mean to attack you personally. I mean to thoroughly attack your point of view, in the same way that I attack anyone's counter-productive views. I called what you did (i.e., "" insult someone at so many different levels and so definitively [without diligent proof]"") ""irresponsible"", ""low"" and ""[probably a] knee-jerk reaction"". It is understandable to take all that personally, but on the positive side, it is simple to avoid it in the future.  I will say that probably saying that you would also react by attacking me was immature, but not a far-fetched assessment based on the fact that this is the internet. Since you seem to be otherwise cordial, I am sorry.

I don't care, too many people are and there is nothing I can do about it.  Here is the thing. There is a substantial difference between the ""races"". It is not racism to simply point them out. There is the problem that some people will use this stuff in a raciest way, but it is really all about the ""tone"".  Granted, calling them different races is wrong, as we are all 1 race, but still. From a strictly medical view we are different, even if we throw actual color out the window. The one way I would bet most people, at least in America would know, black/african american/african/whatever people are MUCH more susceptible to sickle cell. According to CDC data, even taking the highest likely data, people in USA have a 1 in 3,209 chance of having it. Those of african decent have a 1 in 500, with 1 in 12 having the trait.  tldr: Pointing out that the ""races"" are different is not racism, just realism. It all depends on the tone, but the races are different. We may be all equal, but equal does not equal same. Racism is saying 1 ""race"" is better, or worse, then another, not simpling saying they are different, which they are.

I backed and  bought the DK1 specifically on the assurances that there would be committed open development with a full Linux SDK and initially it was like that. I was using the DK1 as a niche project for mapping visually impaired people's field of vision and although the DK1 was bulky and kinda slow but it did have enough open that it was pretty easy to make custom software to run on it.   I thought the DK2 or even DK3 would be just as easy but nada.. and the situation has just progressively gotten worse over the last year or so. I am sickened and disgusted at Palmer's weasley assurances that 'Facebook won't change our commitment to open source support'     So yeah..

I think I'm okay with 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it', to an extent (from a design perspective, certainly).

GTK3 never provided stable version (API/ABI) and that is why most languages don't even bother anymore with shipping bindings.  Hopefully GTK4 will be here soon and if I remember correctly that one has promised stability.
LinuxActionShow,366r4q,totallyblasted,1 point,Mon May 18 01:23:37 2015 UTC,GTK3 doesnt have a stable API?

It is damn awesome rework which could never be done in release or 3. And when I look at the results I'm glad I went on Qt and then back to Gtk. Qt simply isn't for my taste  Main problem lies in languages like C# where bindings can't be just automated and have to be modified manually.

Also, let's be real. I love GTK and GNOME 3, but GTK developers only have themselves to blame for the slow adoption among large applications. My understanding is that large applications with lots of custom widgets are going to depend a lot on internal drawing behavior that has not been stable in GTK 3. All of that has been to the betterment of GTK, but perhaps it's not surprising that people weren't using a toolkit that wasn't ready to be used."

LinuxActionShow,3636vn,thesunnyk,5,Fri May 15 22:15:03 2015 UTC,"We've learnt a lot about software engineering in the last 2-3 decades. C is a great language but at a certain level of abstraction, it struggles with expressiveness. It's also very old and stable, which means radical changes to the language are hard.  C++ on the other hand, is fully featured, but it comes with a huge number of sharp edges and hard learned lessons. It's also very old and the evolution of the language has made it too flexible and also hard to reason about.  Rust is starting from a clean slate. It's a fast and modern language, and probably more comparable to C in simplicity and elegance than to C++. It's also developed fully in the open, and attempts to be more amenable to modern programming design, with safety around all the sharp edges for the low level stuff. It is impossible to crash unless you use unsafe code, and comes built in with unit testing, package management, etc."

It also integrates fairly seamlessly with C.  In fashion, ""fad"" as a concept makes sense. In programming, languages fill a technical space, similarly to how materials play a role in architecture. You could call ""concrete"" or ""wood"" a ""fad"", but the fact is that those are materials which solve problems, and you'll always see stuff made out of concrete or wood in, say, a house, even though it may be celebrated or hidden depending on the type of architecture.  Do you have some examples of ""fad"" languages? I can't think of any."
LinuxActionShow,3636vn,Job_5_Verse_7,1 point,Sun May 17 06:19:59 2015 UTC,"""Fad"" was probably the wrong word there, I meant something more like ""esoteric"". Haskell is a good example of what I meant. It has a lot of very vocal users, but it's not really that popular of a language because it's honestly not that practical in a lot of cases."
LinuxActionShow,3636vn,thesunnyk,1 point,Tue May 19 01:01:52 2015 UTC,"Haskell is quickly growing in popularity, because as it turns out it's a remarkably practical language for the modern world of distributed computing. Calling Haskell ""esoteric"" is probably a thing you could've said reasonably in 2013, but right now big companies are using it to solve big problems.  Depending on the part of the computing industry you look at (SaaS), Haskell is actually less of a niche language than C++, and if you think about computing moving more and more into the internet and being distributed, C++ will continue to lose ground to languages like Haskell and Rust, because they are immensely easier to reason about.  But there are probably going to be entire sectors in software which basically never use them. It's an interesting point, because I never really thought about the gap between traditional computing and modern computing, but it's basically just becoming wider and wider, right down to the tooling."

LinuxActionShow,3637gg,philnc,1 point,Mon May 18 13:59:12 2015 UTC,"With 1,000's of servers to manage most Fortune 500 companies don't have the resources to mix and match distributions. Standardizing so you can automate most ops is the only way you get out alive. RHEL/CentOS and Ubuntu do many things in such different ways that it would be costly for most shops to accommodate both in the data center (it's truly the little stuff, like where libraries are located and what versions of different components are in the base distro). Further, Red Hat doesn't have the edge in deployed, paid, subscriptions, only because of momentum. RHEL as a distro has always been tailored for the data center and made great efforts to prove it, while Ubuntu made its reputation on the desktop. Developers using Ubuntu on their desktops is fine, but in my experience what often happens is that the server crew then gets burdened having to port those apps over into RHEL (note, some admins might actually welcome this as an opportunity to show their stuff). On a recent project I made the mistake of allowing our contract developers to use Ubuntu on their side and I wound up having to do a substantial amount of work then getting things to work on our RHEL systems -- to the point where I think it really reduced the value of whatever warranty we got, since I had to act as mediator in every diagnostic effort. As a senior architect I have to take the blame for that. I should have known better.  But the bigger picture is that developers should be able to work in whatever environment they're employed in. While we may be able to divide up the market into Windows/Apple/Linux, that's about as fine as you can cut it and still remain competitive. To do that you need meaningful training in Linux systems and FOSS apps/services. Personally I think that Red Hat's curricula, especially the RHSA/RHCE courses, are outstanding for the practical techniques they convey, but the Linux Foundation courses I've seen also seem to be well worth taking (especially in that they take care to point out the differences between distributions)."

Is this the continuation from the old official XBMC app?\  Please keep in mind there are two Kore apps (pun non-intended) on the store.  Official Kore app from the XBMC foundation Unofficial by Synced Synaps
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,Gadileth,11,Thu May 14 09:51:02 2015 UTC,To clarify something: Firefox doesn't ship proprietary code in its browser. I hope that is understood by everyone. But it includes the code to integrate such proprietary services.
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,linusbobcat,1 point,Thu May 14 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"From the article it feels more like Mozilla is trying to push more services to the ""Firefox Account"" rather than to bring in proprietary services to Firefox the browser. I'd expect the Firefox account to integrate to many, whether proprietary or open source, services in the future."
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,synapsos,10,Fri May 15 00:02:02 2015 UTC,First of all I love Pocket and I use it all the time. But why do we even have:   the Share button Integration for web apps and EXTENSIONS   when we can simply integrate it right into the browser? Anyone remember Flock?
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,linusbobcat,1 point,Thu May 14 16:14:17 2015 UTC,Agreed. Pocket for one already integrates really well on Chrome and Firefox.
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,thevladsoft,1 point,Thu May 14 23:59:24 2015 UTC,Pockets addon is not supported any more.
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,unsafeword,11,Fri May 15 01:17:09 2015 UTC,"For those who feel strongly about this, as I do:  Leave them feedback."
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,bbguimaraes,3,Thu May 14 16:19:07 2015 UTC,"It uses a proprietary service, it doesn't ""include"" it except in that it accesses it. But the same is true of every last entry in the search engine table.  Misleading title, IMHO."
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,groovechicken,5,Thu May 14 20:53:54 2015 UTC,That was a big WTF when I updated nightly yesterday.
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,jdblaich,7,Thu May 14 14:01:42 2015 UTC,And so it begins...
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,jimrandom,3,Thu May 14 13:43:37 2015 UTC,And all the ads that go with it.
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,_AACO,3,Thu May 14 14:01:36 2015 UTC,Too bad you can't just disable it and move on with your life.
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,jimrandom,1 point,Fri May 15 00:08:52 2015 UTC,Sarcasm?
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,_AACO,1 point,Fri May 15 11:54:55 2015 UTC,Yup.
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,kevinjqiu,1 point,Fri May 15 14:54:22 2015 UTC,I had to be sure
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,ShellBard,5,Fri May 15 22:22:32 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the sentiment here... Mozilla employs a lot of developers. You ""freedom warriors"" aren't paying for FF development... Someone has to pay the bill!  Besides they are not shipping proprietary code in FF.. They were merely integrating with a popular 3rd party service.  Give me a break!  I hope they did get a deal from pockets."
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,veritanuda,3,Thu May 14 17:20:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not happy with the change, but I do agree with you, this isn't a horrible way for Mozilla to keep things moving."
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,Tireseas,2,Thu May 14 17:31:36 2015 UTC,Am I so old and crusty that I have no idea what Pocket is or why I should use it?  Sounds to me like some sort of trendy teenage fad that will be dead in 2 years anyway.
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,NothingMuchHereToSay,2,Thu May 14 21:15:29 2015 UTC,"This is mostly a nonissue other than potentially being feature creep, which is kind of ironic considering the whole reason Firefox exists."
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,palasso,6,Thu May 14 23:27:23 2015 UTC,"They're competing with shitty companies that are currently killing Mozilla. They HAVE to make these changes, despite them being incredibly reluctant towards this type of shit. Honestly, as much as I want to support them, Firefox has gotten really really bad as far as hogging my RAM or just constantly slowing down, even after removing Canonical's defaults within Ubuntu's version of Firefox, it still lags really badly and HTML5 video just isn't possible on Youtube.  Yes, Mozilla HAS to make these choices, this world is run off of the mainstream, the people who will pay money for stupid shit or just use it and not care about getting tracked or whatever, so they use Google services for the sheer convenience. Convenience is all the mainstream give a damn about, which is why IE and Chrome are the two most used web browsers.  This makes Mozilla and Canonical the only 2 gateways to FOSS, we need more mainstream people using FOSS in order for privacy to survive."
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,sb56637,1 point,Thu May 14 16:11:25 2015 UTC,"IE is losing usage share much faster than firefox, they're closer than ever.  Also, speaking of RAM usage and way of playing of youtube videos could be interpreted by someone as requesting more ""convenience"".  This word has been used a lot for the purpose of showing that if someone prioritizes things differently from someone else he's doing it due to reasons of lazyness and ephemeral happiness  (e.g. don't use Skype for communicating, you're sacrificing freedom for convenience etc.)"
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Fri May 15 07:04:11 2015 UTC,"Well, Firefox has been including a big fat search box in its UI since the beginning of time, and that search box integrates...hold on everybody........ a proprietary search engine! :) And the potential for Google to do Bad Things™ with its proprietary service is astronomically higher than that of Pocket. So this doesn't seem like a big deal to me."
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,lykwydchykyn,1 point,Fri May 15 15:32:06 2015 UTC,"Yea this is disappointing and I know a lot of people are trying to fix this screw up. I mean there are Open Source alternatives to Pocket, why use this crap Mozilla?"
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,MichaelTunnell,3,Thu May 14 16:45:31 2015 UTC,I'm guessing there was money involved...
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,rogerology,-2,Thu May 14 16:57:17 2015 UTC,"I hope not, I hope someone just didnt think about it and it was an honest mistake."
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,MichaelTunnell,2,Thu May 14 17:09:37 2015 UTC,I would like to know about those alternatives.
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,_AACO,3,Thu May 14 21:50:08 2015 UTC,"Save to Read - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/save-to-read/  which is a Firefox extension to accomplish the same thing.    Maybe they wanted a hosted solution that could be used across multiple devices ? . . ?  If that were the case there is also ""wallabag"" which they could host themselves in Firefox Sync and provide the same functionality as Pocket. Wallabag is Open Source and is a self-hosted solution. - https://www.wallabag.org/"
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Thu May 14 22:51:45 2015 UTC,Because money is needed for further FF development
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,_AACO,0,Thu May 14 18:50:45 2015 UTC,there are many other ways to do that.
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Thu May 14 22:46:54 2015 UTC,"Go ahead and suggest them to Mozilla then, I'm quite sure they wont say no the other functional ways of funding."
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,_AACO,1 point,Fri May 15 11:53:16 2015 UTC,they already have many if you think you this is the only way they have to make money then you should try to explain how they have existed for more than 10 years without doing this.
LinuxActionShow,35xhn7,wiegraffolles,1 point,Fri May 15 23:47:07 2015 UTC,"Well, the ways they have apparently aren't enough so if you have any good suggestion they haven't tried or aren't using you really should propose it to them"
LinuxActionShow,360rm4,tiagoprn,1 point,Fri May 15 03:07:25 2015 UTC,You'd need a lot of ram. Probably wouldn't run very well.
LinuxActionShow,35zg12,Mikerr89,0,Thu May 14 20:24:03 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a ""port"" and not a port..."
LinuxActionShow,35yr24,gabriel_3,2,Thu May 14 17:09:50 2015 UTC,"from openSUSE News:   This WebRTC-based video conferencing system is still in its early stages of development and there are tweaks being made to move the project forward. Unlike Google Hangouts’ 10 person limitation, the project currently dubbed Jangouts exceeds that capacity limit. During the testing, 18 people attended the 25-person room limitation of 25. The latest test even worked on a mobile device. If anyone want to get involved with this project, join the #jangouts channel on Freenode. Jangouts is hosted on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), but donations of servers to the openSUSE project are always welcomed. Just email me at ddemaio@suse.de if you are interest is donating a server with 100 gb or more of RAM to the openSUSE project."
LinuxActionShow,35yr24,sb56637,2,Thu May 14 17:11:31 2015 UTC,Nice! And the GitHub page:  https://github.com/ancorgs/jangouts
