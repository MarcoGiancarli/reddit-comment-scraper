Alabama,3e32qn,Imaginary_girl,12,Tue Jul 21 16:09:34 2015 UTC,"My wife and I moved here to Huntsville almost fifteen years ago (having lived in northern states), here's some things we noticed as we acclimatized (some good, some less so):   By and large people are friendlier. Do some small talk first before getting down to business. Religion is everywhere. Pick a team, Alabama or Auburn. If you don't care, just be a nominal fan of one or the other. But pick one. You may be told ""Yes"" when the real answer is ""No"" so as to avoid face-to-face conflict. (Especially when dealing with contractors you've asked to come over to make, or provide, an estimate for something. They won't have it when they said they would, and when you call them about it will tell you they're working on it, but you still won't get it. If you don't get it after one reminder call, call someone else.) It helped a lot when we realized this. If there's a line of cars coming towards you, and people on the road are stopped ahead of you, you stop too. It's a funeral procession. If a car two ahead of you is signaling for a turn, the car immediately ahead of you may signal as well to let you know, although they're not going to make a turn (thankfully becoming rarer). It is illegal to wait in an intersection to complete the left turn you started when the light was green. You cannot enter the intersection until the route is clear. Yes, really--a friend got a ticket. It takes about ten years before you can say ""Y'all"" without being self-conscious about it. Don't rush, it'll feel right when the time has come."

I've done it to keep people from thinking that they could go on around the line and t-boning a car that they couldn't see had a left turn signal going.

Sure, not all of them are going to work and some have flaws, but that sure as hell beats sticking to the current status quo.

Also, Google hyperbole and take a long hard look at your lack of pragmatism.  Edit: The difference between a Hillary fan like myself and Bernie's supporters is pretty simple. If Hillary doesn't win the nomination, I'll vote for whoever the democratic nominee is because I know the damn difference between a republican president and a democratic president. You guys are all scorched earth in your support for Bernie. It's a damn fine way to elect another Bush.   Keep pretending there is no difference and get back to me 8 years after the election.

Again, get back to me when there's a national movement to elect progressives across the board.   Until then, I'll take a candidate that can win, make a difference, and give me 50% of what I want.

Alabama,3dkrbh,GamblinGambit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:03:59 2015 UTC,"Yea, as said by others, you don't need to do anything other than take a written test. Having MSF means you will get lower insurance here but it isn't required in this state.  I took MSF just because I wanted to make sure I knew as much as possible before riding on public streets, sadly most people here aren't that responsible.  In fact, one guy rode his motorcycle to the MSF training course every day before taking the class and I asked him if he rode before, ""nope that's my first bike"". At least, he took the course though.    Our state doesn't seem to care about licensing of people for vehicles almost at all.  For example, I have my vessel (boat) license in Alabama while I should not legally have it. I took the boat license test along with the motorcycle test because they asked if I wanted to. I said ""sure why not"". I missed only one question on the motorcycle test, they refused to tell me what it was, so I got that with ease. The boat license on the other hand, I missed 80% of it . . . complete and utter failure on that test. They gave me the license for it anyway.  It was lucky for them that I hate boats and will never attempt to use the license so it is a massive mistake that won't bite them in the ass but I doubt I was the only person to ever have that happen here."

Alabama,3d8vzx,Pincheded,3,Tue Jul 14 23:48:45 2015 UTC,"Not even a little. This means that Alabama will become a relay point for data transfer in the southeast and basically that is all it means. Of the current 6 cities that have Google Datacenters, Google Fiber is in none of them.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Alabama/comments/3d8vzx/google_building_600_million_data_center_in_alabama/ct3uu8x"
Alabama,3d8vzx,MichaelTunnell,4,Wed Jul 15 04:15:49 2015 UTC,"This benefits Google and no one else really other than ping response to Google servers.*  Google chose the city they did purely due to its location and cost to develop.  Location:    If you look at Stevenson, AL on a map you will notice that it is essentially in the center of the Southeast. Datacenters need to be in centralized locations to ensure optimum pings for the users in the area. Mayes County, OK was chosen previously, on a map you'll notice it is essentially in a centralized location for Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, and Missouri.   Cost:   I highly doubt Stevenson had any leverage in the negotiations, that had to be good for Google. Expenses in Alabama are much lower in general for most of the datacenters that Google has so that is also a factor of cost. I bet that they also likely were given subsidies of some kind to ""sweeten the deal"". That area actually has Fiber internet already thanks to the North Alabama Electric Co-op, so Google can benefit from Fiber speeds without having to spend any money to install it themselves.     To address the 100 Jobs, the people mocking this for the amount are actually missing the point of what should be mocked. The thing that should be mocked is not the amount of jobs but the type of job it is.  These datacenters are managed by highly-skilled professionals, access to these datacenters are so restrictive that the majority of Google employees do not have access to even walk into the buildings.  Stevenson, AL has ~1,700 people in the city. How many of those 1,700 do you think have those skills? I'd bet a total of about absolutely zero.  One could argue that people from Huntsville could have those skills and that would not be surprising considering there are rocket scientists there but I would then point out that Stevenson is 60 Miles from Huntsville, roughly about an hour drive both ways.  What is more likely?   Google tries to find people in Huntsville to drive the hour commute or willing to move closer to Stevenson. Google moves 100 of their 47,700+ employees to work in Stevenson, AL. Google finds people from various parts of the country and move them to Stevenson, AL.   I would estimate the order to be 2 then 3 then something I didn't think of and then maybe 1.    *Note #1 - Ping Response is how long it takes for the signal you send to a server to be received and the response signal received by you. The closer you are physically to said server the faster the response.  *Note #2 - I exaggerated when I said ""no one else . . . other than"" because technically Owners of the land, Power Companies, Janitorial, Groundskeeping, and other vendors that would be essential to have . . . those would probably also make money but  the average citizens almost none at all."

Alabama,3d5tg2,silentmunky,0,Thu Jul 16 18:33:37 2015 UTC,I oppose Bernie because he is an admitted socialist. I oppose socialism because it is inherently contradictory to liberty.
Alabama,3d5tg2,barrett51bmg,3,Thu Jul 16 19:00:12 2015 UTC,"Can you explain how any of his proposed ideas are contradictory to liberty? From what I have read and seen, he seems to be the only guy who wants to give us MORE liberty by addressing economic inequality, ending the war on drugs, and ensuring more working Americans are treated with respect (universal healthcare, more vac/sick leave, infrastructure upgrades, ect.) Do you have a preferred candidate, and why have you chosen them?  I'm not here to persuade you towards Bernie. Just trying to get into your mindset and try to understand why some people dislike him."
Alabama,3d5tg2,silentmunky,0,Thu Jul 16 19:09:04 2015 UTC,"universal healthcare, more vac/sick leave, infrastructure upgrades, ect.   This is in no way related to freedom. This is double speak for, ""If you vote for me, I will rob this group and give you a cut of the earnings.""  For example, repealing the patriot act is an increase in freedom. Repealing the NFA is an increase in freedom. These are increases in freedom, as they limit what the government can do to you. Everybody gets a net bonus.   Now then, what is not an increase in freedom? Universal healthcare. Why? Because you pick winners and losers. The winners, usually the people who vote for Sanders. The losers? Those who have to fund it.   You cannot claim it is freedom when A) you are talking about material items, and B) when it had to be funded through taxes of another group of citizens.   ""Oh but u/ILikeMyDogNotYours, these people get access too!""  That is irrelevant, as it has no moral grounds. For example, lets say you saved up your money to buy you a pedigreed black labrador. Well, the neighborhood kids didn't, and they want your dog. So, they gang up and take a vote, and surprise surprise you've been nominated to give up your dog so everyone can have a better quality of childhood, and they will beat you up if you refuse.   However, to make it more palatable, they tell you can see your dog on tuesdays.   That is universal healthcare. It isn't freedom, because you have to rob others to fund your existence."
Alabama,3d5tg2,ILikeMyDogNotYours,0,Sun Jul 19 15:42:09 2015 UTC,"Do you also consider roads/highways, emergency services (fire/LEO), power infrastructure, and disaster relief as robbing others? All of these things VASTLY improve civilized society. We all throw in a small amount and we all benefit. We literally wouldn't be here, or be a nation, without the notion of taxes paying for basic services that benefit the whole of society.  Our current healthcare is employer focused (although medicaid is a massive help to those who get it) and relies heavily on third party insurance companies. These companies are incentivized (since they are trying to make a profit) to make sure their service makes a return. We could simplify our healthcare by going to a single payer option, and cut out the middle man, which would result in net savings across the board for national healthcare. Societal healthcare is just as, if not more, important that the items I listed above.   Sure, some people will not work to pay into the system, but still receive care. That is not theft, that is society looking out for everyone. Having a healthy and debt free society is a net benefit for a country. Currently, medical debt is the leading cause for bankruptcy. People defer medical treatment because it could drain their banks. That is not how healthcare should be treated and will only cause MORE problems that we will have to address yet again, as a society (increased disease rates, poverty, increased crime rates, ect).  To continue this system is idiotic. To call it theft is ignorant. Healthcare workers will still get paid to work, we will likely see a reduced cost for healthcare services (no middle more middle men), and everyone would be able to live a healthier life without risk of financial ruin. Overall it is a massive improvement for everyone, aside from the private companies that handle healthcare insurance.  Is it not the American way to guarantee everyone has the same chances to get ahead in life? America was founded on equality for all, why should healthcare not be part of that guarantee? You are welcome to disagree, but please take the time to look further into this issue."
Alabama,3d5tg2,silentmunky,0,Mon Jul 20 15:44:38 2015 UTC,"What he calls ""addressing economic inequality"" is in reality using the police power of the government to take from some and give to others.   ""universal healthcare"" is akin to slavery. Because you are asserting that you have the right to another person's labor.    more vac/sick leave   This interferes with my right to govern myself and make whatever arrangements, within the free market, I see fit to make with any potential employer. Programs like he proposes hurt those who have the least to offer an employer. Those who because of a combination of low education, little experience, lack of natural talent, or natural drive, can be priced out of the market and the opportunity to improve themselves, because they simply cannot produce enough value to justify being hired at the government mandated minimum cost.    Do you have a preferred candidate, and why have you chosen them?   I stand with Rand."
Alabama,3d5tg2,barrett51bmg,3,Thu Jul 16 19:43:08 2015 UTC,"What he calls ""addressing economic inequality"" is in reality using the police power of the government to take from some and give to others.    This is false. He wants all to give fairly. The tax cuts in the last three-ish decades have given more to fewer... he just wants to go back to how it was during this country's most prosperous times.   ""universal healthcare"" is akin to slavery. Because you are asserting that you have the right to another person's labor.    No one is forcing you to work without the benefit of that work... that's slavery. Socialized medicine, for the US, would literally mean ""Hey, you know that money you're giving to the corporations to insure us? Since they need profits and we just want healthcare we could pay less to self-insure... and cover everyone.""    Socialized medicine would do what it's done in most every other country that's enacted it... reduce costs, while covering more.   This interferes with my right to govern myself and make whatever arrangements, within the free market, I see fit to make with any potential employer.    No, it only sets a lower bounds. If you can negotiate more vacation time, good on you... Bernie has no problem with that. He just wants a more healthy lower-bound.   Programs like he proposes hurt those who have the least to offer an employer. Those who because of a combination of low education, little experience, lack of natural talent, or natural drive, can be priced out of the market and the opportunity to improve themselves, because they simply cannot produce enough value to justify being hired at the government mandated minimum cost.   There are more than a few countries who have enacted the policies he's advocating and the evidence is entirely against you. They are healthier, happier, and more well-off.  Even the studies that have been done domestically run contrary to your beliefs. The difference in cost of a Combo Meal at Fast Food X would only have to increase something like 40-50¢ to increase the minimum wage form 8-something to 15-something. And, that's without the employers having to sacrifice a single cent of profit.  Economically, this is negligible.     I stand with Rand.    Got it... no taxes on anything except earned income. You work for a living? Here's your tax bill. You own some stock and got paid dividends? no tax for you!   (not kidding)  You're also support someone who is 100% against abortion (e.g. against personal liberty).  Rand's drug policies.... from what I've read I think I'm actually okay with them. They seem to amount to ""I don't condone you doing it, but I won't stop you either"". That's not bad at all (at least for the less-severe drugs like marijuana).  Gun rights... I have no opinion.  I like firing guns. I can see a use for owning guns. But someone like me owning a firearm to kill coyotes IS different from some gangbanger in Detroit owning one to kill people. There's also the defense argument.  I think I tend to side with freedom over non, but I can also understand that there are different circumstances in different areas. I guess, I actually think this should probably be a ""states rights"" issue (or, probably, a ""municipal rights"" issue).  The EPA:  he thinks anything the EPA does to reduce your profits should be paid back to you 2x. This is stupid and non-small government.  ISIS:  I agree with the dude... we effectively made them.  I'm not sure that we can solve the problem though.  War in general (especially in the Middle East):  I'm not 100% on his position, but I think he opposes it? I'm down with that, but I think his stated military spending budgets are still obscene.  Still over a half-trillion a year... not exactly ""small government"".  Vaccines:  they should be manditory  (where shown safe) as the person in question isn't able to make the decision and they've been proven effective. Most of us are alive due to vaccines and there is not an argument against them. This isn't a ""rights"" issue as people are trying to paint it. This is an ""are your parents unfit"" issue.    TLDR: I'm with you on Rand for around half of the stated issues, but I think that the reasons you're against Bernie for the other reasons are unfounded and cry of rhetoric, not critical thinking."

Alabama,3d1o03,MichaelTunnell,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:25:41 2015 UTC,"Well not exactly.  Legal means specifically stated as legal.  Illegal means specifically stated as not legal.  Decriminalized means specifically not illegal but once was illegal, though still not legal.  Essentially if there is nothing about it at all then it just isn't illegal. You can't be arrested or anything for it but that doesn't technically make it legal."
Alabama,3d1o03,ezfrag,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:06:51 2015 UTC,"No, that's not how laws are written. Anything is legal unless the law says it is illegal. If a law is written to make a broad subject legal, you could have a section that guarantees legality to an exception to keep a narrow subject legal.   For instance, it is illegal in this state to carry a gun in a school, unless you have a pistol permit which allows you to carry it in concealed.   Decriminalized means that it's not specifically legal, but under certain circumstances will not be prosecuted. Examples include marijuana possession in California and Oregon. In each of these states you must have a permit to legally purchase marijuana at a dispensery and possess certain amounts. If you have too much, it's still prosecuted under the old law.   Legal or illegal is a black and white matter, there is no gray area (regardless of what you see on TV). You either broke the law or didn't."

The same demands would apply to the person ""operating"" the self driving car as the person driving a normal car. The traffic codes refer to the person in control of any vehicle as ""driver or operator"" or ""person in charge of a motor vehicle."" So whether you're actually holding the steer wheel or not doesn't matter.   The entire traffic code is found in title 32 here you want to give it a look over.  The way the law works is you must find something that prohibits them not something that allows them. If there is no code that prevents self driving cars, they are legal. Good luck.

I posted a link to Facebook and Twitter and went to bed, and I woke up to it having spread like wildfire. Several people emailed me suggesting I contact al.com, and they were kind enough to run it pretty much unedited from what I posted.  It would be really nice if Roy would listen to sense, but I don't think that's going to happen. I know there are a lot of good people out there, and especially here on /r/Alabama, that are trying to create a new image for this state and, most importantly, a 21st century Alabama where everyone can be valued. But there are days when people like Roy Moore seem hellbent on tearing it all down and re-fighting the same 1960s battles that I just ask myself why I'm defending this place when it would be so easy to just walk away.  But I live here. It's home. And if we don't at least try to make it better it definitely won't ever change. It's enormously frustrating, but we just have to keep up the good fight."

It is such a horrid reputation that they immediately think the worst of me the moment they find out.  I have to preemptively explain my stance on things just so the stigma is not transferred to me.  Most of my clients are from out of state so I avoid telling them unless they ask. I have actually purposely changed my accent, not because of this but it helps so that they ask less.  That is how bad our state's reputation is."

Alabama,3bjf1c,barrett51bmg,18,Mon Jun 29 18:40:32 2015 UTC,So many states are begging to get sued for violating federal law. Shouldn't you go to jail when violate a court order? I know I'm paying the exwife's lawyer fees for bad legal advice that let me innocently violate a court order or spend 60 days in jail.

Alabama,3bjf1c,IdlyCurious,3,Mon Jun 29 20:16:57 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to reply because a lot of people didn't understand the MS/LA problem with issuing license.  Both states were wrapped in a federal court on same-sex that, by law, had to be cleared before the licenses could be issues. Neither state was trying to fight the federal law, they just literally couldn't issue the licenses.  Another thing about the above article. Probate courts really have no power past the county level. If they fail to comply, the state will most likely step in before the federal government does.  No state wants to be the lone fighter in what they know is a losing battle."
Alabama,3bjf1c,bsami,2,Tue Jun 30 13:40:39 2015 UTC,They generally are simply relieved of their position as Roy was once before.  He was not directly ordered by a higher court to do something.  It would be nice if he was removed again.

Alabama,3bioa5,Norieger,13,Mon Jun 29 15:24:57 2015 UTC,"I sympathize with the articles point but I disagree in that I think the problems are deeper than the political system itself:   This is a state where christians are very comfortable in using the government to further their religious ends- be it laws on alcohol, gambling, beer sales, gentleman's clubs, and various other blue laws down to some draconian rules that prevent liquor bottles being visible through an establishment's windows. Rampant cronyism going mostly unchallenged. It seems like the same good ol' boys are always putting politicians in their pocket regardless of whatever letter is next to their name. Many believe the inertia of Montgomery will prevent progress so much that they simply give up hope.  The state constitution is so wildly dysfunctional and inappropriate and a vestige of a political fight from over a century ago. It limits home-rule to a comical extent which hurts local investment and punishes well run local governments Education is not valued by many in this state and our incredible rate of spending on education is increasingly a failed tactic of throwing money at the problem. I don't want to social engineer people but really, our dedication to education in this state is between inadequate and piss-poor, despite spending more per pupil than many assume. Racial issues in this state aren't allowed to be forgiven and moved on from. Leaders from all angles try to manipulate these issues for their own benifit and the public's scab is constantly ripped off and salted. It has to stop from everyone. I wish we could pledge to be Alabamians first and start seeing those trying to manipulate racial issues be shamed. Our state gets the brunt of criticism it deserves and other places avoid it due to being fashonable, in style, etc. We made this bed ourselves with our political and social issues. We have to fix our house before we can really start attracting respect from the community. Obviously that is going to take a long time and it won't end up in a Utopia, but don't let perfect be the enemy of improvement. Oh and this may be unpopular, but I'd love to see and Interstate quality road from Mobile to Tuscaloosa, Livingston, or Meridian MS, as travel N/S from Mobile is too roundabout via Montgomery and investing in South Alabama is desperately needed."

I'm proud to be a Birminghamster but not an Alabamian.  Our city has its faults sure but it tries to be one of the few beacons for tolerance and acceptance in our state. I am glad of all the cities in Alabama that I live in this one.  At the same time, I'm frustrated and disheartened about being from Alabama as a whole especially when our political system is used as an oppressive machine to hurt anyone that the powers that be don't agree with.  So yea, I have given up on this state but not my city so I guess your comment has given me some hope that there could be a shimmer of hope for our state.  So thanks"

I understand the bad taste in people's mouths over that monster that was responsible for the charleston shooting taking tons of pictures of himself with it and also the way it was used in response to integration by racist bastards, but that doesn't change the fact that the majority of people who respect that flag do so out of southern pride and not hate for black people. I mean, hundreds of thousands of Muslims were killed in the name of Christianity, but there's not a backlash against the cross. I just wish people on both sides of this would realize that some things mean different things to different  people and  move on."

IMO, anyway."
Alabama,3bbe3p,IdlyCurious,-1,Mon Jun 29 19:19:08 2015 UTC,I think the issue is that the major reason for the Confederacy being created was racism - a belief in the superiority of whites and the the natural inferiority of blacks and the moral superiority of slavery.  It wasn't just one part of the government.  It was the cause that made it happen.
Alabama,3bbe3p,ragbagger,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:24:58 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you but it pisses me off how people conveniently forget that basically the entire country felt this way at inception, less than 100 years before the Civil War. And honestly the majority of the country  still did after the civil war with the possible exception of the slavery part. It's easy to take an absolute moral view in 2015 - and very fashionable to hate on the south apparently.   Another thought - Slavery has been an accepted part of ""modern"" civilization a whole lot longer than it hasn't. The idea that all men (and women) are created equal is a fairly new concept, historically speaking and still not accepted in all parts of the world.   Edit: typos and stuff"

Alabama,3b7fi7,danceswithronin,25,Sat Jun 27 14:07:58 2015 UTC,"The fact that this is still even an issue is appalling to me. I mean, what the hell, it's not like anyone is forcing anyone to get a gay marriage. All the redneck theocrats need to get the fuck over it. Don't agree with gay marriage? Don't marry someone who is the same gender as you. Problem solved.   And most gays aren't Christians (not because they don't want to join a church, but because many sects of Christian churches make them feel unwelcome and they end up following other spiritual paths as a result) so stop trying to use scripture to justify your position - you can't force your religious beliefs on someone who doesn't follow the same religion as you. You may as well be an Islamic radical if you feel you have the right to.   I'm gay, I'm a proud Southerner, and anyone who doesn't like it can start driving north 'til they hit the Mason-Dixon line and keep on goin' until you hit the Canadian border as far as I'm concerned, because if you don't believe in a free country with liberty and equality for all, you don't deserve to live in the United States in my opinion. Because individual freedoms are what this country is about.    Gay people deserve the right to live free and peaceful and easy just like anyone else. We're not hurting anybody. So if you don't like it, mind your own beeswax."

Alabama,3b579u,alagary,10,Fri Jun 26 01:48:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not really that conflicted about the flag anymore. The author frames the question in terms of removing the flag because it offends people, but that almost misses the point for me. To many people, even in the South, the flag doesn't symbolize Southern pride anymore. If I have the flag on my truck, or in my front yard, most will see ""He's not a big fan of black folks"", not ""He loves the South.""   And that's a real bummer, because I do love the South. But I don't want to associate myself with the many people who use the flag to mean something different nowadays. I remember the first time I went to a protest against neo-nazis in Germany, I was surprised to see them sporting the confederate flag and wearing American football jerseys. That's the way outsiders see it. I wish there were a nice, convenient symbol without too much baggage I could use to show my Southern pride without insinuating it's also white pride, but that doesn't exist. Or at least, it's not the confederate flag anymore, if it ever was. I understand where the author is coming from, but the trend seems to be going towards associating our flag more and more with flagrant racism, and less and less with simple regional pride."

Alabama,3b579u,MichaelTunnell,0,Fri Jun 26 06:51:21 2015 UTC,"While this guy writes fairly well his facts are all kinds of screwed up.  The most egregious screw up is him saying . . .    ""The ignorance of the disgruntled protestors is evident in their refusal to acknowledge that the flag widely recognized as the 'Confederate Flag' was never actually adopted as the flag of the Confederacy.""   Actually, it most certainly was adopted by the Confederacy to claim that it wasn't purely because of empty space is absurd. (proof that it was)  The Battle Flag as it was originally known as was created as a ""war flag"" to only be used during battle.  However in 1861, due to the confusion of the first flag looking very similar from a distance from the official U.S. flag they changed it. They adopted the battle flag as the only focus of the new flag which also added white space around it. The battle flag design was untouched when incorporated into the new flag.  They also made another flag to add a red vertical banner to signify bloodshed, the battle flag was kept unmodified in this design as well.  So yes, two of the three official flags of the Confederacy included the flag in question thus adopting it.    The issue with the flag is more than just racism though that is what annoys me.  The racism due to slavery is a factor in both the reason for the war and the reason for the distaste of the flag but there is more.  The flag is a symbol of hate and treason.  The hate part is obvious and declaring war on your own country is obviously an act of treason.  By flying that flag you are not only displaying your approval of slavery but also that of committing treason to your country.  To the people who claim that slavery wasn't a factor of the war, please explain to me why the declaration of war explicitly states slavery as an aspect of going to war? I would love to hear someone try to argue that.    Finally, removing it from government property is not banning it outright. They have simply realized that leaving it there serves no actual purpose other than promoting racism, slavery, and treason.  If someone wants to feel good when they see it then be my guest but our local and state government should absolutely not be promoting these ideas in any way."

Free daycare is a valuable and generous thing to provide to working parents who can't afford the high cost of commercial daycare, and giving kids a place to be with supervision is much better than leaving them to fend for themselves while parents try to earn a living."

I personally have no stake this issue (I'm in an opposite-sex relationship, and took the survey as such). I'm just pointing out what I think is a small issue here that may potentially lead to confusion on the part of a survey taker or bad data, both of which are bad.   Since you're looking for gendered data, you may just be able to correct it with a note in the question instructions as to how you want people in same-sex relationships where both partners shopped to respond."

Alabama,3aqnh1,peckrob,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:58:22 2015 UTC,"As a fellow survey administrator, do you have any suggestions for how to reach an older demographic of Alabama residents?"
Alabama,3aqnh1,fraglen,2,Tue Jun 23 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"What is your sample frame (the people you want taking the test)? Is it people in Alabama between x and y ages?   From a test design standpoint, this is what you would use a screener question for. At the beginning of the test, usually the first question, you might say something along the lines of:   Are you currently a resident of the state of Alabama between the ages of 18 and 40?  [] Yes  [] No   And then, you can either end the test or allow them to complete the test and then filter out the unwanted results once the test is complete and you're processing the data. You should also specifically state in the introduction that ""this suvey is intended for people between the ages of x and y."" You can ask several screener questions, but I would keep it under 5 and keep them simple (ideally, yes/no). Basically, framing in people you want and framing out people you don't.  Getting people to take surveys and controlling for potential variables that could affect your results is really, really difficult. But there's no such thing as a perfect survey (which is why results usually include a statistical margin of error).  Very generally speaking, reddit skews young, but that's a big generalization and you might get plenty of good data from here. Phone surveys tend to work best for the 40+ demographic but, as I understand that this is a school project and you probably don't have access to a call center or even volunteer labor to farm that out to, that probably won't work for you. So your best bet is to spread it as liberally as possible to try to get as many people as you can, and then use screener questions to aggressively weed out the responses you don't want."
Alabama,3aqnh1,peckrob,2,Tue Jun 23 01:42:41 2015 UTC,"I actually don't have an age range. I figure ""married or cohabating"" pretty much covers that. I'm currently just trying to figure out ways other than reddit to get the survey out, because you're absolutely correct that reddit skews young."

Alabama,3ae55l,IThoughtYoudBeBigger,13,Fri Jun 19 11:29:20 2015 UTC,"so, i'm a former journalist and have friends who work for al.com. here's the deal:  there are pretty much two types of content-producing employees: cannon fodder and the real reporters.  the cannon fodder are the people who quote press releases and report what other news orgs are reporting. they rarely generate any original copy on their own, and are often referred to as ""content curators"" by the company. outside the company, they're pretty much referred to as a waste of space.  the reason you see lots of typos or factual errors is 1) there is little to no oversight for most of these content curators (so no, there are no frontline editors who actually read a story prior to publication for most of those folks.); 2) the company's theory is to try to get stuff up on the Web first. then, if there are errors, to correct those later in updates. (the problem with this, of course, is that once people have seen a story, they are not likely to come back to it, so AL.com is pretty much stating that they're OK with giving people false or misleading information.)  the second level of content-producers are the real reporters. John Sharp in Mobile, Joseph Bryant in Birmingham, etc. those guys are actually good, experienced reporters. i'd throw Carla Jean Whitley in there, too. she's a very good, conscientious reporter, but she's also mainly a features writer, I think.  then there are columnists like John Archibald, who is sort of his own animal.  anyway, all of that to say that AL.com is not always the best news source. they've made a move to be Alabama's BuzzFeed, and it has cost them in terms of credibility and readership. they have hurt their communities where they had longterm daily newspaper readerships (with two of those papers being very good—Mobile and Huntsville—and Birmingham being OK at best.), and they don't seem to care. i do my best to not give them any clicks at all."

Alabama,3a4leh,MichaelTunnell,4,Wed Jun 17 13:51:52 2015 UTC,"For those who haven't been following Sanders here's a NYTimes article that highlights his voting record as Senator: Please Read  In general, he's TRULY fighting for the people. Where Hilary spoke to the banks to get her bribes before the populous he has renounced the bankers and refuses to take their bribe money. If I'm not mistaken, he's the only person running, besides Rand Paul (no chance), who wants to regulate the banks. Hilary just said a few days ago that she wants to give them ""incentives "" for not being corrupt; which is lawyer-speak for not punishing those who do or regulating so they can't.   Don't worry though... we in AL; one of the least progressive states in the country with the second dumbest population in the nation. We'll vote for whomever fights against progress to keep tradition alive. The vocal minority (bible thumpers) will see to it nothing changes because change scares them. God, I hate those people."

Old policies and ideas have been proven to be faulty, and I think it is time we make some changes. This state could be so much more than the butt of every redneck or down south joke."
Alabama,3a4leh,Repulzz,4,Wed Jun 17 19:10:05 2015 UTC,"Nice generalizing.. To be honest Alabama is swinging libertarian. Look at the polls ran Paul is actually a big positive here. Let America decide. Capitalism vs socialism.  Rand vs Bernie.   Do not like Bernie at all, he has good meanings but America can't feed everyone even if we tried."
Alabama,3a4leh,silentmunky,6,Wed Jun 17 14:48:59 2015 UTC,What about Bernie in particular do you not like? Just curious to hear the full argument you have against him.
Alabama,3a4leh,Repulzz,0,Wed Jun 17 16:09:04 2015 UTC,"I don't like the ""pay your fair share"" thing he has against the rich. It's discouraging businesses or people who built that cooperation from the ground up. I understand businesses getting taxed but not rich family's. Like it or not they stimulate our economy. We need a flat tax a low percentage. Also we need to cut social security and push it back into the private sector.   He wants to give everyone a free education, that won't work.. If we did that we (people who make 60k + a year) would be taxed so heavy it'd be useless.   Also how about building a pipeline from Canada to Houston and use our lands to get natural resources. Then we don't have to rely on foreign oil. Plus that will lower the amount of emissions by ships coming to the U.S."
Alabama,3a4leh,silentmunky,6,Wed Jun 17 16:31:05 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I gotcha. I won't start an argument about the specifics of all your ideas, but I very much disagree with you. I think you have been misled on some of these issues.   For example, a recent IMF study on wealth inequality (PDF warning), a massive issue right now globally, shows that the rich do not stimulate the economy. In fact, poor and middle class increase GDP growth to a higher degree.   First, we show why policymakers need to focus on the poor and the middle class. Earlier IMF work has shown that income inequality matters for growth and its sustainability. Our analysis suggests that the income distribution itself matters for growth as well. Specifically, if the income share of the top 20 percent (the rich) increases, then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term, suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent (the poor) is associated with higher GDP growth. The poor and the middle class matter the most for growth via a number of interrelated economic, social, and political channels.   Thanks for clarifying why you are against Sanders for me though."
Alabama,3a4leh,SandyBritches,7,Wed Jun 17 16:52:23 2015 UTC,"You're making A LOT of assumptions without looking at the facts. There are several other countries who have free education and it's worked without crippling the middle class.   Sanders has repeatedly said that he intends to tax the wealthiest 1% of people. You know, the ones who put their money overseas so they don't have to contribute to the economy and force the middle class to bear the burden so they can keep growing and hoard their personal wealth.   I can't believe you're actually arguing for the TPP, which is a Koch project, who are the wealthiest people in the world who don't want to pay minimum wage to their employees (actively trying to abolish the min wage now). Not to mention the environmental implications; see Duke energy crisis. This is what happens when people like the Koch bothers get their way and have a company capable of destroying the environment. Wow, dude... just wow. There are alternatives to using natural resources.   If you have any proof that what you're purposing will have a positive effect please cite your sources (without using Fox News)."
Alabama,3a4leh,silentmunky,5,Wed Jun 17 16:51:01 2015 UTC,"If anyone needs proof that the idea of tax cuts for business or the rich doesn't work, just look at Kansas right now. The Koch Bro's have ruined my home state. Their ideals were a massive failure that has now plunged Kansas into a budgetary black hole that they think can be alleviated by increasing the sales tax. Sales tax disproportionately affects the poor and middle class."
Alabama,3a4leh,SandyBritches,2,Wed Jun 17 19:12:25 2015 UTC,"Sales tax disproportionately affects the poor and middle class.   This is why the rich should be taxed at a much higher percentage. They don't really spend more than the average person on goods and services. Ceteris paribus, they eat and shit just as much as we do. Sure, they spend more lavishly, but the tax from that is de minimis. If we tax the higher brackets (5,000,000+) at 90%, as Sanders suggests we'll be able to invest more into small business through government grants and we'll be able to put more into the general fund (which pays teachers and cops). If we don't, the money is going to sit in their banks, only benefiting them and their rotten-ass children (Walton's, I'm looking at you), then they'll open a ""charity"" and funnel the money into that saying, ""see I give to the lesser folk."" (Clinton's, I'm looking at you.)  A personal thought: tax all US business on sales made anywhere in the world. Yes, I said it. They already get a foreign tax credit and that should be enough. We shouldn't wait for them to repatriate the money, because they're not going to do it.   Rant over."
Alabama,3a4leh,silentmunky,2,Wed Jun 17 22:18:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you. The rich need higher taxes than they pay now. They have gamed the system and are now paying politicians to push laws that benefit them. It's not hard to see that our economy suffers when all the money is concentrated at the top.   Time for change. Sanders is looking at the real issues and trying to tackle actual problems. If we don't address the wealth inequality and continue to reduce the economic mobility of the poor and middle class, we are in for a bad time."
Alabama,3a4leh,Repulzz,6,Thu Jun 18 00:54:58 2015 UTC,Well isn't it great that we all have options.

For food, Dream land BBQ is famous around Bham.   Edit: One really cool thing about driving 20 is you will pass both the Talladega Superspeedway (the fastest and longest track in NASCAR) and the Barber Motorsports Park (where Indy Car races as well as the Superbikes).

Alabama,38io8u,pjdonovan,2,Thu Jun 4 21:04:17 2015 UTC,"Bear with me. What I fear is that people will say that the reason that these juveniles were placed in our overcrowded jails to be sexually assaulted is because they were black in Alabama. The people of this state have tried for many years to eschew the sins of the past, but with so many recent events around law enforcement allegations of racism, I feel it is only a matter of time before it happens in Alabama.  I am in no way downplaying what happened to these kids, it is horrible and should definitely be investigated. I'd be willing to bet that the majority of these kids were imprisoned for offenses that in other states would be a fine and probation as well.   What I don't want is Al Sharpton marching on the same streets Dr. King marched slinging mud before the investigation has even begun.

A sign hanging from the top deck reads, ""63rd Anniversary Reunion of the Battle of Shiloh Survivors.""  Photo by G.W. Landrum - 1925  These are the Union veterans who planted the ""Peace Tree"" in Wilson Park. According to the Times on Tuesday, April 7, 1925, 32 elderly Union veterans, survivors of the Battle of Shiloh from Iowa and Nebraska, Illinois and Kansas, along with several others, arrived in Florence on the steamer Tennessee Bell and, after a grand tour of the area, planted a sycamore tree in Woodrow Wilson Park which they labeled the “Peace Tree.”"
Alabama,388fgq,sockdologer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:16:13 2015 UTC,That's pretty cool. Is there any information on how the locals reacted?
Alabama,388fgq,sockdologer,2,Tue Jun 2 20:24:28 2015 UTC,"The April 7, 1925 issue of the Florence Times had this to say.  ""Florence today has welcomed a group of soldiers of the Union armies of the Civil War, who came with hands outstretched in friendship and with the desire to make a permanent expression of that friendship in the planting of a memorial tree, a white limbed sycamore which will signify for the years to come the ""peace"" which exists in all sections of our land. The idea and the act was a most graceful one, and is one which is fully appreciated by the people of Florence, who will endeavor to see that the ""peace tree"" is properly cared for and grows successfully as a living memorial of the purpose for which it was planted. That one of these trees has been planted here at Florence at Muscle Shoals, along with the others which give their message at the gateways of our national cemeteries, is significant for the part which Muscle Shoals may play in our re-united nation as its wealth and strength is increased by the rightful use of this great project.""   one which is fully appreciated by the people of Florence   This leads me to believe that the local people were pleased to see such a gesture."

Alabama,385c2u,Halaku,14,Mon Jun 1 23:34:37 2015 UTC,Roy Moore is a hypocritical piece of shit. He's been forcibly removed from office for wilful disregard of the United States Constitution in the past and he's wilfully disregarding his superior's orders now (and forcing those below him to do the same).  We need to stop electing judges.
Alabama,385c2u,your_evil_coworker,3,Tue Jun 2 05:53:10 2015 UTC,"Further, does anyone with any sense actually believe that RBG is doing this against the will of the other Supreme Court judges? I kinda assume they talk to each other now and again and I kinda assume she has some idea on where they fall."
Alabama,385c2u,your_evil_coworker,5,Tue Jun 2 05:56:10 2015 UTC,"From the article:   ""“She’s basically thumbing her nose in front of the other justices that she’s going to say what she wants to say and do what she wants to do, and she’s going to ignore the rules of ethics,” Moore said, adding that judges are bound by those rules."" Said Roy Moore.   Which is funny coming from Mr Moore.  Consider, that he took it upon himself to move his Ten Commandments memorial into Alabama's Supreme Court building, in the middle of the night and without the knowledge of the other justices.  A suit was filed against his actions Glassroth v. Moore.  US District Court ruled against Moore as did the Court of Appeals.  Many would conclude that removing the memorial would be the proper course of action.  Except for Mr. Moore that is, he doubled down and said """"As Chief Justice of the State of Alabama, it is my duty to administer the justice system of our state, not to destroy it. I have no intention of removing the monument of the Ten Commandments and the moral foundation of our law. To do so would, in effect, result in the [be a] disestablishment of our system of Justice in this State. This I cannot and will not do!""

Nightlife?   If you have a choice between the two, Birmingham would be a much better bet in regards to ... well, just about everything. Traffic is probably not as bad in Montgomery, and it's 1.5 hours closer to the beach, but that's probably all it has going for it.  Birmingham is a real, good sized city (the metro is over 1 million in population) so you should have no problems finding things to do there."
Alabama,3838ee,disasteruss,10,Mon Jun 1 18:26:54 2015 UTC,"As for Alabama as a whole ... it has it's plusses and minuses.   Plusses: Cost of living is low. Taxes are reasonable. Plenty of things to do if you look in the right places. Lots of outdoor opportunities if being outside is your thing (we have great golf, for instance). Birmingham has a good music scene but it's hit or miss elsewhere in the state. The major cities are nice (Birmingham, Huntsville, Mobile). Beaches are great and are a day's drive from just about everywhere in the state. We don't have any real pro teams in the state, so Auburn and Alabama are our ""pro"" sports teams.   Minuses: the weather is kinda crazy (Birmingham and north is part of Dixie Alley which can be prone to violent tornadoes). It's hot and humid in the summer, but reasonable most of the year and it never gets really cold for long. You'll laugh the first time you see us get ""snow"" (a dusting) and it closes the town down.   We also have really incredibly fucking dumb politicians that just keep getting reelected thanks to straight-party voting. So if you're looking for any kind of ""progressive"" state policies, this ain't the place (on the whole the only state I've been to that was more conservative than Alabama was Utah)."

It's very rare I find a band I care to go see.  There might be two a year.  It's a decent enough place if you don't mind blatant racism from whites and blacks both.  The government is stagnant and our state politicians do little to further the economy or quality of living.  This article sums up a few of the problems nicely.  Local government (Birmingham's at least) seems willing to do more, at least as far as funding large projects such as stadiums and parks.  As far as being forward thinking, forget about it.  I'm not sure if it's the people or politicians, but the state seems doomed to remain stagnant and unchanging.  That being said, there are some really nice places out here, there is some fun to be had, some interesting people to meet (if you don't mind looking really hard), and a wide variety of wonderful cuisine.

It's not as if the majority of Police are out there taking legal money from honest hard working citizens for no reason. I'm sure there are a few bad apples but I've never personally met one. Only seemed to read about them here on Reddit.   This has been done for as long as I can remember from nearly every dept of every state I've lived in.

With this law, the police are legally, not constitutionally (the whole point of my argument), allowed to assume its dirty money if the owner chooses not to disclose how he/she came to earn it, which he/she doesn't have to disclose. Then, the police then keep it to use however they wish.  It's robbery. It is stealing money, without anyone holding any trial in court, and used to then directly fund themselves. If anybody else did that, they'd have their ass hauled into court and convicted of robbery."

Kiva Dunes - Also $99 a round and includes cart and range balls. Further down Fort Morgan Road. Another quality course. More compact then Peninsula which is why I enjoy Peninsula more.   Lost Key - $79 a round for cart and range balls. Have not played but heard it's kept in good shape and challenging. Just over the border in Florida. May be a bit closer since yall are staying in Orange Beach.  Craft Farms - $79 a round including cart and range balls. Also have not played but heard good things about. Located in Gulf Shores just off the island on highway 59.  Hopefully this helps. You can't really go wrong with any of the courses above.   *Prices are the morning rates.

Completely takes all of the emotions out of both sides of the debate and gives everyone, essentially, civil unions as far as the state is concerned. Any interested couple could have the union solemnized as a marriage by a religious authority if they so chose. Those who don't wish to still have all the legal/tax/etc benefits of it.  The only problem I can really see is just how deeply embedded marriage is, beyond the law. Things like insurance, doctors offices, etc, are all still predicated on ""marriage"" as a legal term, and a lot of things would need to be updated to take this into account. That, and how does this square with other states that don't have similar laws? What do those contracts mean if you move to a different state?  FWIW, I'm a supporter of marriage equality.

And I can't see how it wouldn't be assured of having that standing, because undermining the marriage standing of straight couples in this state would not fly at all."
Alabama,377dh2,pjdonovan,2,Mon May 25 18:55:57 2015 UTC,"What do those contracts mean if you move to a different state?   Lex loci contractus.

This is actually true to a point but also could easily be false.  Palcohol states that it is 58% Alcohol by Weight yet at the same time is sold by Volume not weight and is only 12% alcohol by volume. Wine is actually 12% alcohol by volume as well and is more practical to carry a single glass of wine than it is this powder.  There are people saying that it can be snorted to get drunk ""super fast"", actually no it can't. You would have to snort the same amount of volume that a glass of wine is and that much would only get you the same amount of alcohol as the glass of wine itself.  Is Palcohol as dangerous as alcohol once made into a liquid? No, it is actually very impractical and inefficient so if used as a liquid it wouldn't provide any more danger than Wine.  Is Palcohol dangerous at all? Yes, actually it could certainly be dangerous because it can be snorted. The snorting of it is not dangerous by itself but the amount of powder you would have to snort in order to get the same effects as Wine is absurd. Your respitory system is made for breathing, not for snorting and absording powders. If snorting is done to an excessive amount, which would be required to be effective, it could be quite dangerous in that situation.  I think it should be legal because making it illegal is what is giving it press, if it were legal no one would care.  The part that is hilarious to me is the fact that it still needs water to be mixed with in order to even drink it so it isn't saving any space because you still need the water. Carrying the alcohol in liquid form is actually much more practical.    To learn more, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c0QLaVLhTs"

Alabama,36pkfw,johnny_moronic,5,Thu May 21 20:10:35 2015 UTC,"When the Republicans finally took over the AL legislature I predicted that within a few years you'd see significantly fractured factions developing within the party that mirrored the division between Republicans and Democrats.  While the idea of one party dominance is ""we're one united party all wanting the same things, so since we're in control now it will all smoothly come to pass"", it rarely takes long for that train to run off the rails.  If you are a united party all wanting the same things, then there's little opportunity to distinguish yourself as a legislator, to move up the party ranks (other than by attrition). If you're just going to vote ""Yes"" on pre-ordained legislation (as we saw early on under Republican control), well, anyone can be elected to do that.  You need factions and disagreements so that you can be a deal broker, to swing and deliver votes, to make a name for yourself as one who gets things done. You're seeing this at the national level with Boehner vs the Tea Party, and the same thing is happening at the state level. Especially within a stressful environment like Alabama's fiscal situation that simply increases the pressure to fracture.  This actually provides an opportunity for the minority party, i.e. Democrats if they're willing to take it, to get some of what they want (albeit while holding their nose) by allying with a faction of the majority party. Such an alliance gives that faction a legislative success that its members can point to as a testament of their legislative prowess--and the minority party gets a bone thrown to it.  Please note: This applies to any single party (Republican or Democrat) dominated legislative body--it's political and human nature, and has little to with party affiliation. This is all more out in the open in parliamentary democracies, where the factions within the liberal and conservative blocs are overt, rather than it being pretended they don't exist."

Alabama,36dxax,G3NOM3,8,Mon May 18 18:59:10 2015 UTC,"Constitution of Alabama:       The Constitution of the State of Alabama is the basic governing document of the U.S. state of Alabama. It was adopted in 1901 and is the sixth constitution that the state has had.  At 340,136 words, the document is 12 times longer than the average state constitution, 40 times longer than the U.S. Constitution, and is the longest still-operative constitution anywhere in the world.  (The English version of the Constitution of India, the longest national constitution, is about 117,369 words long, a third of the length of Alabama's.)  The constitution gives the Alabama Legislature the power to administer most counties directly, with only a few counties having even limited home rule. This supported provisions that essentially disenfranchised most blacks and poor whites, and further limited local autonomy. As a result, about 90 percent of the document's length, as of 2012, comes from its 856 amendments. About 75 percent of the amendments cover only a single county or city, and some deal with salaries of specific officials (e.g. Amendment 480 and the Greene County probate judge). This gives Alabama a large number of constitutional officers. It also makes it very difficult for residents of counties to solve their own problems.

Alabama,364zzv,Crimson013,6,Sat May 16 09:39:49 2015 UTC,"I often go to Mobile for work, so if I can make a few recommendations:  Downtown is not as sketchy as it may appear, particularly Dauphin Street. That's where a lot of stuff is happening - live music and good food/beer at Loda Biergarten, occasional music and trivia at Serda's coffee shop, there's a wee used book store, and I'd also recommended the food at Mediterranean Sandwich Co - super tasty risotto. Also, my single must-try recommendation in town are the bengiets at Panini Pete's.  Carpet Diem coffee over on Old Shell Rd is quite good, Mellow mushroom on the same road is tasty, and out on the causeway is a haven for good seafood - others may have better recommendations for that.  Destination-wise, I like Huntsville and Birmingham pretty well, and the space center in Hville is really worthwhile if you're into that sort of thing. There's also wheeler wildlife refuge if you feel like birding or taking a stroll. Montgomery, IMO, is skippable - with the caveat that there are significant historic sites to the west along highway 80 that pertain to the American Civil rights movement.  Also, rural Alabama looks sketchy and sometimes is. People tend to be friendlier than you'd expect, though, particularly if you're polite.  ....and in a weird aside, mind the more dangerous creatures we have here - black widow and brown recluse spiders, cottonmouth, copperhead, and rattlesnakes, and, of course, alligators, which typically leave folks alone.  Also, it might be worthwhile to learn to identify poison ivy if your parents are the outdoorsy type.  *Edited a bit for grammar's sake."

Alabama,364zzv,Bobby_Orrs_Knees,2,Sat May 16 13:12:47 2015 UTC,"Old cloverdale is great. I love Derk's Filet and Vine as well.  As far as downtown goes: Depends on what you are looking for. If you are looking for a great dining experience, I'd suggest Central. If you're looking for entertainment: A Friday or Saturday night when the Biscuits are playing is pretty entertaining. After the game hit up one of the numerous places to grab a drink after the game.  There is no open container law in the entertainment district so feel free to grab a beer and wander about.  If you're willing to stay out late enough sou la terre piano and jazz bar is a really neat place. However the band doesn't start playing until around 1:00-1:30am."

Alabama,35nrl3,PzPicklez,7,Tue May 12 02:36:03 2015 UTC,"I heard from an attorney recently that about 70% of accidents are caused for no other reason than a lack of blinker usage. USE YOUR BLINKER, EVERY SINGLE TIME!!! Also, truckers cause more accidents in Alabama than in any other state. So, even though it's often unavoidable, stay away from them as much as possible. Always pass them on the left, quickly, and never ride beside them. If a car is stopping you from passing the truck completely, let it get well beyond the truck before you go to make your pass. Another thing, if a tractor trailer is signalling to get over, you can let them know they're clear to change lanes in front of you by flashing your lights at them two times. If you're on a motorcycle, flash your high beams twice."
Alabama,35nrl3,Bobarhino,4,Tue May 12 05:03:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Too many people seem to think blinker usage is optional. And hardly anyone does the light flash thing- I always do out of courtesy.

Alabama,35nrl3,zoso4evr,1 point,Tue May 12 11:52:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, people do not use their blinkers enough. But on the other side of the coin, cyclists also need to make sure they use the appropriate hand signals when turning or changing lanes. Basically everyone on the road needs to share their driving intentions with others on the road."
Alabama,35nrl3,syntiro,8,Wed May 13 04:02:35 2015 UTC,"Keyword: SHARE. Many drivers I personally encounter are much too aggressive on the road.    One thing that I think drivers should be more aware of is the option to call and complain about unsafe drivers on the road. You can call either 911 or the local police department and give them the license plate number, make, and model of the car of concern and describe the dangerous hazard (such as swerving lanes). This can aid in safety precaution and also can serve as useful information for any potential accident the driver may cause."

Alabama,35nrl3,PzPicklez,7,Sun May 17 07:41:09 2015 UTC,"The Mobilians on Bikes are a very active cycling group down here on the coast, you may want to interview some of them. There's a Facebook page if you want to get ahold of them.   Cycling down here is pretty rough. As somebody who moved here from the Pacific NW and used to commute exclusively by bike, I've had to give that up and now only ride for fun. There's only one bike lane in Mobile (on Hillcrest), and cars don't seem to understand that bikes legally belong on the road (not that there are sidewalks anyway). Beyond that, I've been introduced to the lovely activity called ""rolling coal"" where big diesel pickups purposefully blast me with black smoke as they pass me on the street. I'd love to see a legal crackdown on people treating cyclists in such a dangerous way."
Alabama,35nrl3,TMN8R,5,Tue May 12 12:55:52 2015 UTC,"It’s a culmination of many different issues, so there are no simple fixes.   Driver’s ed. in this state is a joke. If you want safe drivers, you need to focus on a quality education program before the issuance of licenses. Ensure that people know cyclists have the legal right to be on the road. Similarly, there needs to be bike education programs to ensure that people ride the right and safe way. Start young and encourage kids/schools to incorporate biking in some form. Law enforcement in general for driving offences seems to be nonexistent. On a daily basis, I see cars blowing through intersections right as the light changes, failure to stop at stop signs, distracted driving, etc. etc. Distracted driving is becoming worse and worse. We need hands free laws, and they need to be enforced. Our state is a joke when it comes to infrastructure. That fault lies with both state and city leaders. Not only are we not building the right infrastructure, the current projects take forever for completion."
Alabama,35nrl3,velophilia,8,Tue May 12 13:56:06 2015 UTC,"We should just make bike lanes that are actually big enough, but not on roads like 280, 78, 31, or any kind of interstate (because traffic).  Also not outside of the downtown area either because its too hilly."

Alabama,35nrl3,mathisawsome2213,3,Tue May 12 04:14:45 2015 UTC,"For the most part I actually find that drivers here (Tuscaloosa) are pretty safe and considerate.  For the most part.  There are a few drivers that think it's funny to buzz cyclists.  In addition to the safety factor related to possible collisions, it can scare the shit out of the cyclist especially when it's a pickup truck with a modified exhaust.  And when the driver or passenger yells some insult out the window at the same time.  The scare factor can make the cyclist temporarily lose control of the bike, which can be an indirect cause of an accident or injury."
Alabama,35nrl3,nicmos,4,Tue May 12 13:31:53 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue with bikers is they choose to bike in the middle of 5:00 o'clock traffic especially around Highway 78 in Leads, Irondale and Mountain Brook. They are on a 4 lane highway that doesn't have a bike lane. Give them a bike lane and it would be no problem. Instead they take up a whole lane and cannot move as fast as the speed limit. I will never understand why they bike on such busy roads with major on and off ramps near I-20. Give them a bike lane and it won't be an issue.   Another problem I witness is some of them don't obey traffic laws. Again, biking on a busy street during rush hour traffic and you blow through a stop sign or cutting around other cars waiting at the stop sign is a sure fire way to piss people off.   I understand you have the right to share the roads with cars. But just because you can doesn't mean you should in some areas. Avoid heavy traffic areas during rush hour times. You are expecting people who have very little attention span or spatial awareness to notice you on a bike. Seems like a no brainer to me.  Solution is simply to add bike lanes and bigger sidewalks in heavy traffic areas. Everyone wins. Cars win, bikers wins, walkers win! Think about how Orange Beach and Gulfshores has their lanes setup. Bike lane on each side! It works so well I have no idea why we don't have them here."
Alabama,35nrl3,purrgady,2,Tue May 12 16:39:42 2015 UTC,"About those spandex jokes. When I first got into the sport I was initially reluctant to wearing tight spandex. BUT, wind resistance increases with the square of the velocity. You don't really notice wind resistance at recreational speeds of 10-14 mph, but as you exceed 20 mph on flat or uphill terrain, the wind resistance becomes really apparent. For this reason, having clothes that don't flap or drag dramatically lessens the workload. Guys aren't wearing spandex to look cool; it just makes it easier to maintain higher speeds."
Alabama,35nrl3,frankshew,3,Fri May 15 14:14:17 2015 UTC,Cyclists must obey the same traffic laws.  Are cars allowed on sidewalks?  No.  Then that means bicycles fucking aren't allowed on sidewalks.  What in the fuck.
Alabama,35nrl3,WarriorHealer,2,Tue May 12 13:13:19 2015 UTC,"There is a difference when being aggressive on the road with another car and being aggressive with someone who will very possibly die if you hit them.  If you have a multi-thousand pound mass of metal, it's not very nice to speed by someone overly close.  If that person hits a pothole and swerves in front of your car (in the same lane), their death is on your hands because you could have easily prevented it by not being such a fucking asshole. (you will go to prison)  It's very simple, don't be an asshole."
Alabama,35nrl3,VCUBNFO,1 point,Tue May 12 18:22:09 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of talk about cyclists on here and I just wanted to add my 2 cents. I am a delivery driver, and during some of the busiest times for me I seem to be stuck behind a group of cyclists and in my job time is money, so if I'm stuck behind a group of you my money is effected. Not everyday but most times coming through Cahaba Heights and driving down Blue Lake or Sicard Hollow, there you are 4 or 5 wide going no where near the speed limit. State law says no more than 3 wide. It would also be courteous to people driving cars to lower that number so they can pass.  Now don't get me wrong, if you want to ride a bike and idolize one of the biggest assholes of this century then that's your right. If the state would throw down some bike lanes then I wouldn't have a problem, but on a busy road with no marked bike lane that's just not safe. Maybe go to Oak Mountain and ride the trails or make a few laps around the park. Would that not be enough? Or stick to residential streets when traffic is low, for your safety and mine of course."

Alabama,35itk4,SpartanAesthetic,10,Sun May 10 20:29:02 2015 UTC,"I'm an Enterprise native, and the people answering this question crack me up. Y'all should've been there 30 years ago, when there REALLY wasn't anything to do.  -Dakota Coffee Works is a decent (although not as good as it used to be) coffee shop to hang out in.  -Annie's Restaurant has a decent burger. They used to have pool tables/video games, too, but I hear they've moved those out.  -Boland Lanes offers bowling. Fun Factory behind it is (I think?) putt-putt golf and other entertainment possibilities.  -Johnny Henderson Park. Soccer and softball fields, walking/running trail. Playground and picnic area. Pond where you can fish.   -Southern Broadway Dinner Theater  -Tennis courts next to the National Guard Armory on Highway 167.  -Cutts Restaurant. Try the chili dogs. Seriously, they're the best in the world. (Says I, a noted chili dog expert.)  -Depot Museum. This place is interesting on a couple of levels: 1) History. 2) They have the boll weevil monument in the center of town, but the bust of the black guy who is actually the one who saved their asses? It's hidden in the Depot Museum. Says a lot about life in the deep South, even today.  -Fitness Trail at ESJC ... er. ... EOCC ... wait, ESCC? What the hell are they calling it these days?  -They have all of the shitty chain restaurants that you know and love. Panera, Chick-fil-A, Jimmy John's, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Mickey D's, Sonic, etc.  -Panama City Beach is within striking distance. 90 miles away, it can be a day trip or an overnighter.  -Vortex Spring in Ponce de Leon, Fla., (an hour or so away) is a pretty awesome place. Ice-cold, crystal-clear water. Scuba in the deep end. Diving platforms/boards and a swing in the shallow end. Paddle boats are also available for rent. Probably one of my favorite places on the planet when it's not crowded.  -Dothan, a city with a metro area over 100,000, has a great deal more entertainment and shopping possibilities.  -Golf ... Tartan Pines is a public course, there's the Country Club, Robert Trent Jones's course, Highland Oaks, is in Dothan, Dothan National Golf Course.  -Paintball, archery, shooting ranges are all over the place down there, frankly.  It's an OK town. The racism scale isn't really that bad compared to a lot of places in the South because of Fort Rucker, where you have tons of soldiers/pilots of all sorts of backgrounds coming through. I still get down there every couple of months, because my parents live there."

Alabama,35itk4,n0j0ke,5,Sun May 10 20:31:43 2015 UTC,"Man,  don't let these people scare you.   True Enterprise doesn't have whole lot going on. I visit it once a month on business.  It is a decent size town.  It is gaining more places.  It does have a Mellow Mushroom,  my favorite place to visit.  I am almost twice your age,  so I can't speak for what the kids do,  but I have met numerous people who grew up there while I was in undergrad at UAB.  They seem to be good people,  so obviously it's not that bad.  As I mentioned I'm not sure what the locals do or where they hang out at,  but I'm sure they will have some sort of summer league for some sport (baseball,  lacrosse, etc). You will have to ask around.    I know they do have a small theater (shows like 2 movies at a time).  Never tried it out so I can't speak for the quality.  No mall but a lot of strip malls that have stores.  Dothan,  the largest city in the area, is about 30mins away and it has more mall like areas and a whole lot more restaurants and shops.    But don't let these people make you think it is a backwoods country place with all dirt roads.  Good luck finding stuff and welcome to the South.  Oh and wear sunscreen."

Others have mentioned the aviation museum on post, but be warned that it will take you a while to get on post now, because you have to get a visitor's pass.  Unfortunately, there's not a huge amount for visitors to do, so there's a good chance you'll get a bit bored. Downtown has a nice area to wander around in, most of the shops are geared towards women, but it does make for good people watching. There's also a bowling alley and a sort of catch-all activities place, they have a roller blade rink, rock wall, and glow mini golf, last I knew. To my knowledge, the paint ball place is still there. There are also some gun ranges if you're that kind of family. There's more to do if your dad is in the military/you are considered a dependent. There's a couple pools on post, one has a rock wall that makes for a good afternoon.  What do you do? That could help with more specific suggestions."

Alabama,35itk4,Preston205,2,Sun May 10 23:31:32 2015 UTC,"My roommate in college was from down in that area, and we went to visit his family one Thanksgiving. What /u/barrett51bmg said is essentially correct: you are coming to rural, rural Alabama. Imagine the rural-est area you can think of. Farms. Two-lane roads. Cows. Chicken houses (which smell fucking awful, by the way, you can smell them for miles). That whole area is farms and a big military base, and that's pretty much it.   The towns may have some small shops or local mom and pop restaurants, and a Wal-Mart. Enterprise will probably have your usual selection of fast food places and maybe some chain restaurants. There might not even be a bar seeing as how Coffee County is a dry county (but Enterprise and some of the other towns may be wet, I honestly can't remember). But there just isn't a lot to do other than farm, go to church, or join the military.  The reality is, you are going to need to drive if you want to do ... well, really anything.  Unless you want to walk miles down two-lane roads.   Not sure what the kids do down there, honestly, but I would bet it's probably pretty similar to what the ones here in the city do: work, hang out with friends, etc. Here, many of the teens take their cars to the parking lot of one of the grocery stores and hang out on Friday nights after the football games (and again, this is suburbia of the state's second largest city)."
Alabama,35itk4,c5load,1 point,Mon May 11 01:04:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for the long answer! After reading the Goat-Man story I'm kind of freaked out. DO you think it will be easy to make friends?
Alabama,35itk4,imanasshole2,3,Mon May 11 01:32:47 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I live in Dothan (about 30 minutes east of Enterprise), but I can vouch for /u/peckrob when it comes to meeting people. Just as it was for him in Tennessee, kids and teens around here tend to stick with whatever clique they've already been in for some time, be it from school, church, or anything else really. This isn't to say that people are completely dismissive of newcomers, but at the same time it isn't always very easy to establish new friends that aren't are involved in their long term, day-to-day activities. With all that said, though, don't think that it'll be impossible to find people who would be willing to get to know you and show you around the area; just don't expect to be to always be their utmost priority either.   Also, while in Alabama, I cannot emphasize the importance of being able to drive enough. In Dothan and in Enterprise alike, there's a total lack of pedestrian infrastructure, as life tends to revolve around driving from place to place for most people. This is especially true in Enterprise since, as you're probably figured out, there's almost nothing to do otherwise that doesn't involve going to a chain restaurant or shopping center. Anything fun to do would probably have to be found by taking a bit of a drive to Dothan, Fort Rucker, or, if you're really up to it, either Montgomery or Panama City.   Anyway, if you have any other questions about the area, feel free to PM me. I'd be more than happy to help you out."
Alabama,35itk4,ragbagger,2,Mon May 11 02:51:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm not sure. I didn't grow up there, but I did grow up in a exurbish-type area in Tennessee (kinda that area where suburbs blend into rural areas).   Most of the kids I grew up around were cliquish, and tended to hang around the same people they went to church youth groups with, or people they did school activities with (football, theatre, etc). Being that it's summer and you're just visiting for a month, I don't want to say it's impossible, but without those groups you're cut off from a lot of socialization. So unless there's anyone in the immediate area of where your dad lives, it's probably gonna be tough.  FWIW, you didn't say how old you are (just teen) or where in NY you're from, just that you can't drive. Are you from NYC and just don't drive or are you too young to learn? Does your dad drive? Learning to drive might be something you could do to occupy yourself. You'd be learning a valuable skill in the process. There might be a summer teen driving school you could go to, or you could find someone to teach you. It's an idea, anyways."
Alabama,35itk4,LittleHelperRobot,2,Mon May 11 01:45:52 2015 UTC,"I""m from a town in NY that isn't a city but there are TONS of kids and events, it feels like it's not even rural. That's why I'm scared about Alabama, I don't want to be bored, I'm hoping there's a spot to meet kids, or that the people are nice. If I ride my bike into town what's the best way to get to know these kids, I don't know what there into down there."
Alabama,35itk4,autowikibot,5,Mon May 11 01:50:33 2015 UTC,"The people in Enterprise are usually pretty nice. I'm not sure you will be able to ride your bike ""into town"" as you seem to expect to.

Alabama,35itk4,c5load,3,Mon May 11 03:02:50 2015 UTC,If you're 16 could you not drive or at the least learn how to drive while you're there? Sounds like the best option honestly.

But yes, in the case of the public food supply, there does need to be somebody telling us that our food is safe, and that somebody should not be the company spokesperson.

Alabama,34z0c5,JohnnyCutler,1 point,Wed May 6 00:36:33 2015 UTC,"It isn't a business; hence the ""quotes"". Businesses tend to benefit the public or fail; government bureaucracy tends to persist whether they're benefiting the public or not. This doesn't add value to the argument that they should be immune from the economic realities affecting their bureaucracy, so I'm not sure why you're pointing it out.  They have more say than almost any other employees in the world. Government employee unions are very involved in politics, and even if they aren't affiliated with or disagree with their unions, they get a vote personally. I've never gotten to vote on my company's leadership; that's the norm for the real world.  If they keep a job, but lose a paid holiday (of which they have many more than most people working in the real world), isn't that acceptable? Would they prefer to keep all of their paid holidays but lose their job, or add on the duties of someone who has been cut?  Real world or bureaucracy, resources are finite. You can't get what you want by petulantly stomping your foot and pretending that reality should and can bend to your wishes.  Edit;   According to this, they already have 13 holidays, so they're not going to be losing any. They're just being assured that they're not going to gain any, and two of them will be unpaid. If we take a 5 day work week as typical, that means that they're losing 0.769% of their income. Based on this, it seems a bit reactionary and petulant to say that ""Any state employee who votes to re-elect anyone in favor of this bullshit deserves what they get."" What kind of fuss and bother would we see if they were actually asked to make REAL sacrifices?"

Although I'm sure Hoover has an economic incentive to have a stellar football program it doesn't mean we should allocate more resources for their extracurricular activities. It misappropriates the resources so that one school can have an opportunity to earn more money over other schools.  If a public school were to establish a finance course to take tax money and reinvested it in stocks to gain an economic advantage over other schools would you still be in favor? I mean, what's the consequence besides using the public facility for reasons other than its intended purpose if you're able to take revenue responsibility away from the state government. Hell, if all schools would do this the state wouldn't even have to fund public education anymore.   Also, if it's a business, then why isn't it being taxed as such?  Please don't vote or reproduce."

I'm on my phone right now, and can't be bothered to link it anyway (google, bitches), but its a mess of standard denialist bullshit couched in dense sciency lingo. It boils down to purposely conflating Alabama's lack of recorded warming (probably because we're still 60% forested) with world climatic conditions, and statistical analysis of carefully selected year sequences to highlight the times when global temp has not risen (generalizing from the statistical outliers rather than the trend). Christy appears to be bought and paid for. He's slick, personable, and shameless. Spann, on the other hand, is doing it because he's part of the god squad.  That's contemptible, and ultimately harmful, but on the other hand, it's undeniable that Spann has an incredible work ethic and a deep, sincere compassion for people in the path of severe weather.

In addition, it is likely that some potential further greenhouse gas warming has been offset by increased aerosols.

When I woke up, she told me it had hit the Best Buy, so I spent the next several hours looking for my friends who lived in a house right behind BB. I immediately made contact with one who was a first responder. Neither of us could reach his housemates. So gathered a group and drove as close to the site as we could. We ended up parked at Bama Lanes and walked the rest of the way. A tree had fallen on the second floor (I later learned this was just the attic portion of that floor. The girl had already gotten with her family and gotten out with the dog. The other guy was still MIA. We realized we couldn't get in the house to search so we went back to Palmer to drink and hope. When we showed up, people asked where we had been. We told them we had been looking for Evan. ""Oh man, Evan is on the front porch. He showed up an hour ago."" We found out he had walked on a different path from us but came to the dorm immediately looking for us.   Thankfully I lost no one I knew that day, though many had harrowing experiences."

Alabama,342rdl,ediblesprysky,2,Tue Apr 28 00:42:27 2015 UTC,"Four years ago today, I was in the middle of the spring quarter of my senior year of college at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music. Cincinnati was bright and full of flowers. I must have had a rehearsal or a class that day, although I don't remember. It was a normal, beautiful day.   But I got home in the late afternoon, checked Facebook, and found that my hometown was being ripped apart, at that very moment, by a monster storm. Tornadoes, straight line winds, the very force of nature, all across Alabama and most of the South. For the rest of the night, I sat glued to the ABC 33/40 live stream, watching James Spann​. I remembered all the time I'd spent as a child, huddled in school hallways with friends, or our tiny first floor half bath with my family, listening to that voice. I remembered watching the sky go from blue to grey-black to sickly green, and that people always said that a tornado would sound like a freight train, running over our heads. But one never came, anywhere I was. Tornadoes tended to hit south of town and leave us (mostly) unharmed; I never even saw one in real life, and only occasionally its aftermath, say, driving down the highway and finding a sudden swath of broken trees.   It was obvious that this one was different.  By the end of the night, 15th Street in Tuscaloosa was almost completely leveled, hundreds of people across the state had died, and thousands were left homeless. The tornado that hit Tuscaloosa would be officially categorized as an EF4. I would NOT want to see an EF5.  I have a complicated relationship with the South and its culture, and by that time, I only had a few people left in town that I even knew, mostly families of childhood friends. But watching my hometown get destroyed reminded me that, no matter where we disagree, we're all still human beings, and no one deserves the terror and destruction that natural disasters bring. What's more, it reminded me that I'm still one of them, an Alabama native, no matter what.   I wish I could have gone down to help in the ensuing weeks, but with it being the end of my senior year, I just couldn't get away. I obsessed over every post about cleanup, every story about the people affected. It drove me crazy not to be able to help. So it makes me happy to see that now, four years later, things are mostly back to normal and going so well.   Love you, Tuscaloosa, you silly place, whether I like it or not."
Alabama,342rdl,mdbmello,2,Tue Apr 28 01:46:39 2015 UTC,"I was huddled in the bathroom at work on 15th street. The sound was unreal. When we emerged from the building (the AC had been ripped off and the windows blown out) I didn't know which direction I was facing. The building on one side had its back room ripped off and the building on the other side was completely destroyed. I walked back to my boyfriend's apartment off of Helen Keller and sat outside his door until he made it back. That night we slept with the windows open. The lack of traffic noise was unsettling. You never really know what quiet is until everything you've learned to tune out is suddenly gone. We didn't sleep that night. We drove back to Birmingham at 3am. I stayed up the rest of the night watching Prince William and Kate Middleton get married. I remember feeling disgusted that I was watching such a trivial event on tv, but at the same time I was so empty after what I and the entire town just experienced that I needed to see someone else living life as if this tornado never happened. To this day, the sound of a tornado siren puts me into a complete state of panic."
Alabama,342rdl,squirrelwithhammer,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:48:14 2015 UTC,I remember having the same feeling. Everything was so creepily quiet that night. My friends and I were out on the porch of the apartment that night thinking about how ironic that was.

I had gotten word on the way down that a good friend from High School who was in Tuscaloosa had been killed and I was just lost.
