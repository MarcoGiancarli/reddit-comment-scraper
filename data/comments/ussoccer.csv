ussoccer,3e1s9j,RunCesarRun,7,Tue Jul 21 08:13:16 2015 UTC,"There's no way Klinsmann changes anything from the previous demolition of Cuba, save for maybe Brooks coming in for Gonzalez.  Guzan  Chandler-Brooks-Alvarado-Fabian  Beckerman-Bradley  Bedoya-Dempsey-Zardes  Johannsson  I would be very surprised if Beasley started at left back. www.onefootball.com/magazine/usa-at-the-2015-gold-cup/"
ussoccer,3e1s9j,CameranAlavi,5,Tue Jul 21 14:00:29 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind Beasley starting at all. Let's face it, he's a longtime veteran and it would be a token of respect to give him a send off game during the Gold Cup. He's better defensively than Chandler although probably worse offensively. Also, Chandler seemed hurt when he came off against Cuba and it might be an injury.  Other than that, I like your lineup very much."
ussoccer,3e1s9j,MrDerpsicle,3,Tue Jul 21 18:03:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Sure, Beasley's veteran leadership would be invaluable. But for me, the chemistry of our team against Cuba was fantastic, and it may be risky to break those XI up. I really do hope that Chandler is healthy, because if nothing else, his crosses into the box have been so dangerous."
ussoccer,3e1s9j,CameranAlavi,2,Tue Jul 21 18:13:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, I doubt that he will change anything from the last game. But I Believe that Beasley would be an upgrade at left back. Chandler has been dangerous when USA push forward but has been very unreliable covering any type of through ball that opponents play."
ussoccer,3e1s9j,CameranAlavi,2,Tue Jul 21 19:30:29 2015 UTC,"Very true, he still has a tendency to get turned inside-out by a good enough through ball. At least the US has the luxury of depth, which hasn't always been true!"

ussoccer,3e1s9j,royalewithnocheese,3,Tue Jul 21 14:21:47 2015 UTC,Here is what I expect Klins to have:  Guzman Chandler-Brooks-Alvarado-Beasley Bedoya-Beckerman-Johnson Bradley Dempsey-Johanson

ussoccer,3e1s9j,MrDerpsicle,2,Tue Jul 21 19:47:16 2015 UTC,"I think Fabi is way more effective as an attacking fullback than he is as a winger. Every time he plays as a winger, he tends to disappear. He also doesn't have the scoring ability or the final ball associated with modern wings. I also feel Bedoya should be used as a workhorse CAM like Raktic rather than a winger. Also, Zardes is starting. I would have cringed at that statement a few months ago, but he has really had a solid Gold Cup and has improved a lot as a player after having some really shaky games in the spring friendlies. He deserves to start."
ussoccer,3e1s9j,MyFaucetsIsMoenNigga,4,Tue Jul 21 17:59:37 2015 UTC,"First of all we don't play with wingers, we havent played with wingers since Joe Gyau started there. We play with midfielders in a diamond, the width is supposed to come from the fullbacks. The left and right side mids are supposed to be box to box. Fabain Johnson plays left mid for a champions league team. He can play that position for us. The last time he did, he had an assist before moving to left back."
ussoccer,3e1s9j,zexypupil,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:42 2015 UTC,Preach.
ussoccer,3e1s9j,MrDerpsicle,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:07 2015 UTC,"The ""diamond"" we've been playing during the Gold Cup is not a true diamond. In a true diamond, you'd have two center mid types as the wide members of the diamond, a dedicated CAM, and a dedicated CDM. That is not the case here. We've played Zardes, Bedoya, and Yedlin as our wide players, and they are winger types. Also, Braldey and Beckerman are overlapping center midfielders, it just happens so that Bradley has more of the attacking responsibilities while Beckerman has more of the defensive responsibilities.   Fabi fits into Monchengladbach's system well as a winger, but he needs to play as a fullback for us. Our wide attackers need to SCORE; they need to be guys like Donovan. The closest thing we have to that is Zardes, and maybe Bedoya.  Fabi can still cross and assist from the fullback position and did so against Cuba. He'd start ahead of Chandler, who might be injured."
ussoccer,3e1s9j,MyFaucetsIsMoenNigga,2,Tue Jul 21 19:58:45 2015 UTC,"What.. Our wide mid fielders do not need to score at all. They are there to be box to box.. Bedoya has been a box to box midfielder every time he has played for us, this is why him and JJ started there during the World Cup, because they are CM's. Also, I don't know how you see two overlapping mids in Bradley and beckerman. There might be .008 percent of the time beckerman was higher up than Bradley. Yes yedlin and Zardes have played wide but so has zusi, morarles and mix. The reason yedlin and Zardes are playing there is for experience and the fact they have enough speed to get back on the counter which is what most concacaff teams do."
ussoccer,3e1s9j,crimsontrinh,3,Tue Jul 21 20:40:39 2015 UTC,"I hope that he would put Brooks and Omar Together. Alvarado hasn't been doing well, and Ream was okay.

ussoccer,3e1s9j,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:19 2015 UTC,Mix should NOT be the holding midfielder. He's a box-to-box guy. I'd much rather have two true attacking fullbacks (Johnson/Yedlin? Johnson/Chandler? Johnson/Beasley?) and have Beckerman as a defensive anchor in midfield.
ussoccer,3e1s9j,kbm5088,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think we will need a anchor in the middle of the park, as much as defense on the wings, as Jamaica's counter will come down the flank."
ussoccer,3e1s9j,MrDerpsicle,2,Tue Jul 21 19:04:10 2015 UTC,"The fullbacks would track back accordingly to control the attacks on the flank.  Both Beasley and Johnson are more than capable of ths, so they should be the ones starting. Yedlin has some tactical issues playing as a fullback, but his speed more than makes up for it as he can recover quickly."
ussoccer,3e1s9j,kbm5088,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:27:42 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point, and in all honestly I had forgotten about Beasley as an option."
ussoccer,3e1s9j,DronePirate,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:47 2015 UTC,I think he'll still start Chandler.  I wouldn't.  Has he not put Gonzalez and Brooks together?
ussoccer,3e1s9j,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:09:32 2015 UTC,"I think Brooks-Gonzalez is our best CB pairing, at least until we have Cameron back on the team. IIRC Chandler might have been injured in the Cuba game, correct me if I'm wrong. I'd like to see Beasley in for him and FJ move to RB."
ussoccer,3e1s9j,MrDerpsicle,2,Tue Jul 21 18:10:13 2015 UTC,"I'd go for kind of a 4-2-3-1 where Bedoya plays as an Ivan Raktic type workhorse CAM, Zardes plays as a Eden Hazard type winger,Dempsey plays as an auxilary deep lying forward who would drift over to the wings when needed., Johannsson is a Chicharito type poacher who makes timely runs into the box. This way, the hold up play up front can be split and assigned to three people (Zardes, Dempsey, Johannsson) rather than just one like we normally have going on with Jozy.  The reason I'm am inverting Dempsey's and Bedoya's traditional roles is because we need a pass first player in the other team's hole between defense and midfield. Dempsey has always been a dribble-first guy rather than a pass-first guy. The 3 attacking midfielders would all overlap each other,crisscross, and combine with Johannsson when he drops deep, or with the fullbacks when they move high up the pitch.  Bradley has a deeper role as an Andrea Pirlo type regista but still gets forward and is the architect of most of the attacks. Beckerman is a midfield anchor and hovers in front of the backline and protects the hole between our defense and midfield, the closest comparison I can think of is Khedira.   Beasley and Johnson are attacking fullbacks who run up the field and provide crosses, but track back and defend.  Brooks and Gonzalez play very similar roles as CBs and are pretty much just mirror images of each other.  ---------------------Johannsson--------------------  Dempsey-------------Bedoya-------------Zardes  --------------Beckerman-----Bradley-------------  Beasley------Brooks------Gonzalez------Johnson  ------------------------Guzan------------------------  Free kicks: Johnson (his FK assist to Zardes was amazing). He also takes FKs with Borussia Monchengladbach and has notched a couple of assists with them.  Penalties: Johannsson  Left corner: Bradley (shoot for another straight corner kick goal)  Right corner: Bedoya (to someone in the box. Target Brooks, Gonzalez, Zardes, Johannsson, Dempsey, or Bradley). Beckerman, Johnson,and Beasley stay back and defend possible counters.  subs:   Yedlin (Beasley 60). Switch FJ to LB. I believe that we need to use Yedlin more as a fullback because using him as a winger is only a short term solution. He will play as a fullback for Spurs or wherever he's loaned, so it makes sense to play him there for the NT. He would obviously have to track back better, but I believe it's doable.   Mix (Dempsey 75). Bedoya would move to LW and we'd see the formation become more of a 4-3-3 with the other center mids continuing as normal and Mix as a box-to-box option kind of like Pogba.  Yarbrough (Guzan 90). Cap tie the mofo."
ussoccer,3e1s9j,MrDerpsicle,2,Tue Jul 21 17:47:38 2015 UTC,"I would love to see a 4-2-3-1 line up. This team will benefit from Bradley and Bekerman playing next to each other like they have for years. And Bedoya would be a dangerous CAM. The thing that worries me about having Dempsey on the outside is that although he has played on the outside before, I don't see him lasting 90 minutes since that position is very demanding. I would like to see him on top and being a mobile striker similar to how german strikers play."
ussoccer,3e1s9j,OHILIKETHATTT,3,Tue Jul 21 18:10:56 2015 UTC,"Like Muller or Gotze? Yeah, I was thinking back to them in the World  Cup and that's kind of how I imagined him playing; as a romaing forward, but deployed as a left winger. Dempsey wouldn't really be on the outside for most of the time, so he wouldn't really be a true winger in the formation. He would be a dribbling option in the box, and would poach goals like his last one against Cuba. You can think of it this way, it's more of a 4-2-2-2. Kind of how we played in the 2010 World Cup with Clark/Bradley, Dempsey/Donovan, and Findley/Altidore except now it's Beckerman/Bradley, Bedoya/Zardes, and Derpmsey/Johannsson. I took his age and his ability to go 90 min into consideration, and decided to edit my original comment. Mix is now coming on as a sub for Dempsey rather than Beckerman, and Becoya would move to LW. The formation would then become more of a 4-3-3 with Mix as a box-to-box option."

ussoccer,3e1s9j,DiscoDrive,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:57:53 2015 UTC,We can bring Yarbrough on as a late sub.

ussoccer,3e1s9j,whatsthefuturehold,2,Tue Jul 21 19:29:39 2015 UTC,"I'm disappointed by the lack of Mix love in this thread.   I think our side was sorely missing him against Panama. Yes, we looked good against Cuba-but c'mon it was a favored match from the whistle.   Sorry to disagree OP, but Corona looked poor to me in his time on the field. I haven't been terribly impressed with Zusi or Beckerman. Bedoya has been a mixed bag. He has great moments and then moments where you question him.   I'd personally love to see Mix play in midfield with Bedoya and see Bradley play CDM. Let's be honest, while he's been solid, Bradley has by no means been our best player creating the most chances. Some of his passes have been pretty poor and he's lost the ball a few times leading to counters.   I think Mix's vision and quick thinking on the ball will benefit us, and Bradley could still play some nice through balls from deep (a la old Lampard) and Mix could drop back if Michael makes a run since he's soccer smart.   (Yes, I am a huge Mix fan and just want to see him play!)   Any thoughts on this idea?"

Obviously if they still wanted Morgan featured more prominently her picture could be bigger and more centered. That way you get the player recognition as well as get other deserving players like Lloyd on there.
ussoccer,3dz09g,dart22,0,Mon Jul 20 19:23:19 2015 UTC,Seriously. If you score three goals in a world championship match you should get the cover.

ussoccer,3dz09g,j_andrew_h,7,Mon Jul 20 21:36:09 2015 UTC,For everyone saying it should have been Lloyd... I seriously doubt this was decided in the past couple of weeks.  They likely picked this months ago and they picked the most famous US player who has proven marketability (yes I know that is largely do to her looks) and is also one of our leading scorers over the past few years.     Lloyd on the cover would have been amazing and I'm all for it; but if you were making that choice 3 month ago would it have been so obvious?    Also keep in mind that Alex Morgan has 52 Goals in 91 games and Carli Lloyd has 69 Goals in 202; so she has been scoring a ton of goals for us.
ussoccer,3dz09g,SoccerFan36,5,Mon Jul 20 20:50:34 2015 UTC,"It's making me pretty mad that people are saying she's only on the cover because she's attractive. There's no doubt she's extremely attractive, but that is not the only reason why she is on it.   She's the most well known player on the team by far. Over 2 million twitter followers and 1.8 million on instagram. She's a forward. People want to see goals scored. IIRC, the last defender on a FIFA cover was Sol Cambell. She's one of our best players. This one isn't really up for debate at all. Over 40 goals with 2 extremely recognizable goals (2011 WC final and 2012 Olympic final) Alex is well on her way to be one of the greatest American soccer players of all time with over 50? odd goals at the age of 26. Side note- I'm excited that there's a female on the cover. Women's soccer is only going to grow in the future and this is only going to help it   I may be preaching to the choir because I haven't seen many negative comments in this thread, but in the /r/sports post, there were so many people being negative about it and my post would never have been seen there so I decided to post it here."

ussoccer,3dz09g,bigthagen87,3,Mon Jul 20 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"I knew they would do this! I was just hoping it would be Abby instead. Alex has plenty of time to be on a cover. Abby is close to retiring (maybe closer than we think) and she is the all time leading scorer. I don't know...maybe she'll be on next years. I am happy Alex is on it though.  Also, this cover looks kind of stupid. Why are they so close together and looking the same way? Could have been designed much better."

ussoccer,3dz09g,Taeshan,5,Tue Jul 21 06:58:28 2015 UTC,"I for one would have voted for Lloyd. Morgan is an obvious attempt to get a more attractive person on the cover, considering, she barely played in the world cup and such."
ussoccer,3dz09g,jsz,19,Mon Jul 20 18:21:54 2015 UTC,"Morgan played for 436 minutes. ~200 less than Lloyd sure but not insignificant. And regardless of Lloyd's amazing play in the knockout games, Morgan is still the most recognizable American player"

I don't wanna hear all that ""Well Cuba sucks"" nonsense, because it would have been so typical of our team to play down to their level and let them hang around in the game for far too long. The most pleasantly surprising thing our team has done all tournament has been absolutely demolishing Cuba just as we should. Normally questionable players like Timmy Chandler and Ale Bedoya have repaid Klinsmann's confidence in them by getting better and better with each passing game. If Chandler and Fabian can hold down the speedy Jamaican wingers, this game should be a breeze."

I can almost guarantee he will hit a screamer from outside the box that will be nowhere near the target. I like him because he's a hard nosed grinder."
ussoccer,3e0fzm,dnlhys,3,Tue Jul 21 00:22:53 2015 UTC,I don't think he should stay at Villa. Staying on a struggling EPL side when you've already been benched is not a smart move. He should move to a club that needs a new keeper. Maybe Espanyol in La Liga could work for him.

ussoccer,3dwez6,CodyWilson7,10,Mon Jul 20 02:35:29 2015 UTC,"Peralta lost his balance with hardly any contact in the air. He looks like he may have even been offside, but I can't completely tell."
ussoccer,3dwez6,ooter37,-18,Mon Jul 20 02:37:44 2015 UTC,"His shirt was VISIBLY pulled back by the Costa Rican player. You have to be blind or severely biased to not realize that was a penalty. If it was a US player fouled like that, everyone here would scream for a penalty."
ussoccer,3dwez6,CodyWilson7,3,Mon Jul 20 02:41:12 2015 UTC,He arm is on the guys torso tho...and if you watch the video he lands the same way that he jumped. Soccer is a contact sport. What is the guy supposed to do stand there and watch him and hope he doesn't score? This was nowhere near enough to justify a penalty.
ussoccer,3dwez6,ooter37,-20,Mon Jul 20 02:45:37 2015 UTC,"I have watched the video, multiple times. Have you? What site are you watching the replay on?"
ussoccer,3dwez6,CodyWilson7,9,Mon Jul 20 02:48:47 2015 UTC,LOL just saw the replay. He BARELY even gets contact with the guy. He barely gets a hand on the guys shorts. Literally no way any sane person can call that a penalty.
ussoccer,3dwez6,CodyWilson7,-15,Mon Jul 20 02:51:00 2015 UTC,"It's not just the amount of contact that matters. A tiny little bit of contact, in the right situation, can mean the difference between a clear goal scoring opportunity and no chance of getting to the ball. That's what happened there, that's why it was a penalty."
ussoccer,3dwez6,ooter37,4,Mon Jul 20 02:53:58 2015 UTC,He touches the guys shorts. That is NOT a penalty....

ussoccer,3dwez6,ooter37,-3,Mon Jul 20 03:57:32 2015 UTC,"Was a bit more than shirt pulling, first of all. Second, do you think a shootout is somehow better? They both suck equally."

I wanted Costa Rica to win, and I don't like ending on a penalty, but I can still fairly evaluate the play and see that it pretty clearly was a penalty. Maybe watch the video later when you're not emotional. It might be more clear for you."

ussoccer,3dwez6,ooter37,5,Mon Jul 20 03:30:55 2015 UTC,That wasn't a penalty. At all.
ussoccer,3dwez6,bostonboy08,5,Mon Jul 20 02:51:03 2015 UTC,If that's a penalty then every match would have 30 pk's.

For example, pulling on an opponent's jersey near midfield (when he isn't on a breakaway) isn't going to draw a foul. The same contact in the box against a player in the air who's trying to reach a ball for a scoring opportunity, however, is always a penalty if the refs catch it."

ussoccer,3dyheg,PiGaKiLa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:12 2015 UTC,"I went and looked and the highlights for the mex nigeria game in march 2014 looked to be turf not sod.  If it was sod they did a good job but I am pretty sure it is turf for that game.       https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hjacq2kOxA  Either way it is a mistake.  Sod over turf almost never works and it should not ever be played on turf.  There are so many stadiums in the USA that have real grass, can fit a soccer field on it, and seat over 40-45k there is not reason to every play on anything but real grass for official games."
ussoccer,3dyheg,tinybubbles1234,3,Mon Jul 20 21:14:04 2015 UTC,"Definitely sod.   Natural grass will be brought into the Dome and put down for the game, as it was for the previous soccer games there.   Like I said, the Georgia Dome does a very good job at laying their sod out for the games...good enough to fool you into thinking it was turf. Atlanta draws extremely well for soccer - especially for El Tri. This is also the first time the USMNT has been here in forever - why should Atlanta miss out?"
ussoccer,3dyheg,PiGaKiLa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:26:52 2015 UTC,If only all could lay the sod as well as atl seems to do I would be ok with it on a regular basis but the other games in the gold cup and other places in the usa in the recent past say not many have the system mastered.

ussoccer,3dyheg,rophel,2,Mon Jul 20 16:42:34 2015 UTC,Yeah.  Man U vs. Club America had temporary sod that was terrible.  It NEVER works here and we keep doing it.  It also doesn't help if you throw a goddamn One Direction concert and two soccer matches on it in three days on the hottest weekend we've ever had here.

ussoccer,3dyheg,ampsmith3,2,Mon Jul 20 17:25:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I'm fairly certain Seattle could move from FieldTurf for a hybrid field called Desso Grassmaster that both Green Bay and Arsenal use.  However, the Seahawks are really attached to the shitty turf for strategic reasons.  Also, it's three times more expensive to do hybrid, would require grow lights (Emirates has portable ones they roll out we could likely use), and it might not hold up to being used so much since I don't think anyone that has a Desso surface has two teams share it.  So 3x cost AND having to replace it more often may be the issue.    However, soccer is almost as important as NFL here...I think it's time to come up with a solution, because it IS out there.  It's just expensive as hell."
ussoccer,3dyheg,ampsmith3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:51 2015 UTC,"Plus I imagine the more people start to use it, the costs could come down some?"
ussoccer,3dyheg,ampsmith3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:40:36 2015 UTC,"http://www.dessosports.com/hybrid-grass/costs  Not sure how true any of that is.  Another issue I've been told is that the shadows from the field would cause issues with sunlight not reaching parts of the field.  From what I understand however, grow lights could at least partially resolve this.  I think it'd move us into some good places for international soccer and touring teams to visit and make a bunch of money for the stadium owners.  Currently, just about everyone hates our field, but LOVES our turnout and atmosphere."
ussoccer,3dyheg,kooknboo,2,Mon Jul 20 19:46:35 2015 UTC,Well football (US football) has created some great resources for growing grass in stadiums with low to no light exposure. Alabama's Bryant Denny stadium has issues with sunlight on the grass due to its upper decks on all sides. Growing lights can certainly be used to help out! Off seasons tend to make college football fans read anything... including grass discussions haha
ussoccer,3dyheg,ampsmith3,3,Mon Jul 20 19:50:24 2015 UTC,"The sod on top of the turf at BSU looked really slippery for the players. It was weird seeing it green, I'm so used to blue. Also the field was just too small. American football field are too narrow and too short. This guy who played for Club Tijuana was impressive as a sub in the second half. Paul Arriola. Turns out he's American and I'm looking forward to seeing him play for the national team in a few more years."
ussoccer,3dyheg,kooknboo,2,Mon Jul 20 16:37:02 2015 UTC,"It may be type used, I know the Rose Bowl has laid down sod right before the national championship in NCAA football before and there wasnt a big issue."
ussoccer,3dyheg,CameranAlavi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:44:57 2015 UTC,"I think the slipping was largely due to all of the water they firehosed onto the field. I'm not sure why it was necessary to saturate it right up until opening kickoff and during halftime. The sod itself was probably not the issue actually, more the process involved. Does anybody know why they would have needed to soak it? Weather was about 95F and sunny and super dry as usual but its sod over turf. They're not trying to make the roots grow or anything"

I feel he's at his best when he collects the ball from a deeper position and drives at the defense with powerful runs, either with or without the ball."

ussoccer,3dzli7,swalkerfour,3,Mon Jul 20 21:13:19 2015 UTC,Yedlin is a gimmicky player for me. Is he fast? Yes. Does he try hard? Yes. Beyond that I'd take the true midfielder vs him any day over 90.
ussoccer,3dzli7,FunkyMonkeyBanana,2,Mon Jul 20 22:46:53 2015 UTC,"I see him as a great sub. His speed coupled with the fresh legs of coming on later in the game is probably the best use for him for now, at least in my opinion."
ussoccer,3dzli7,gabeh007,0,Tue Jul 21 07:55:32 2015 UTC,"That's fair. I've got a soft spot for him, but as /u/swalkerfour said, he's a great sub at this point."
ussoccer,3dzli7,WimpyDeer,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:26 2015 UTC,I dig him as a sub as well. One of the announcers mentioned he's perfect for pressing a tiring defense.

Then there's the physical standpoint. Julie Johnston dominated in the air during the World Cup at 5 foot 7. Abby Wambach is 5 foot 11. The thought of her (or anyone else) marking a 6 foot 5 inch Omar Gonzalez on a corner is hilarious, and beyond that I don't think any USMNT defender or forward besides DMB is under 6 foot.  I however would love to watch a mixed friendly where Michael Bradley and Abby Wambach take turns drafting players from both sides."
ussoccer,3e179h,SeattleGunner,0,Tue Jul 21 05:26:51 2015 UTC,Fair enough the only reason I even would think the match could be fair is the fact that the Men's team has such a shaky back line right now and the skill and passing of the Women's team would be more than enough to get past that. That said yes defending corners would be nearly impossible for the Women.  I agree though that would be an awesome idea to have a mixed friendly. I would absolutely watch that!

ussoccer,3dwwuo,tinybubbles1234,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:32:29 2015 UTC,It sold out due to mexico fans buying tickets for the most part.   Mexico has played there a few times and sells large amounts of tickets everytime.  68k for game against nigeria on a weds night in 2014.  In comparison USA played just a bit down the road vs the same team 3 months later in the final wc send off game drew 52k on a sat night in jaxsonville.
ussoccer,3dwwuo,tinybubbles1234,4,Mon Jul 20 21:31:29 2015 UTC,"If this was a planned friendly, I'd probably agree with you, but tickets sold out before the matches were decided, which tells us a few things  1) People that purchased tickets took a risk on their team being in the semi-finals.  2) People that purchased tickets have the discretionary income to spend on tickets that might be worthless to them.  Broadly speaking, a lot of Mexican and American fans did probably buy tickets in advance assuming that their team would go through. But it doesn't take an economist to infer that there is a significant likelihood that more Americans that bought tickets than Mexicans because the predominantly white middle class Americans that support the USMNT have more discretionary income than the predominantly working class Mexicans that support El Tri.   Does this sound cruel? Probably, but it's silly to dismiss basic economic realities. It's also silly to compare the capacity to draw fans from two different venues that are 5+ hours away from each other and have a huge disparity in average income."
ussoccer,3dwwuo,wolfmalfoy,-1,Mon Jul 20 22:16:47 2015 UTC,"It is wrong.  The mexican team outsells the USA every time in the USA.  The mexican fans in the USA have the cash to spend, not all have a lot but what they got leftover a lot spend on soccer.  It unites them as a community,  It is something that reminds them of where they grew up, It is a stress release from a shitty job or whatever.   How can i compare?   Lets take alabama college football.  Alabama's median household income is ranked 46th at about 41k.  Yet the football teams of alabama and auburn rank in the top 11 of home attendance. Not combined.........each...That is two schools in one of the poorest states (using median household income as a measurment).  No other top 11 are in the same state,  next up fla, ( gator,noles, canes) after that south carolina  (cocks and tigers)  Point is,  People budget for things that are important to them.  The attendance figures show Mexico out drawing US on a reg basis.  It is getting better for USA but it not even close for now."

The theory that Mexican fans can not afford it as well as USA fans is absurd and TBH walks right up to if not over the rasicm line.  edit adding one more example.  Mex vs costa rica in orlando fl  on a sat at 6 pm  53k.  about a week later USA plays in nashville.  sat night, 6 pm,  44k.  Both were warm up games for world cup.   Team USA just does not sell as many tickets as Team Mexico.  It is fact.   Ticket prices were about the same.  stadium sizes about the same,  both on a saturday,  If anything orlando should have had lower attendance as it is hot as hell in orlando in july."
ussoccer,3dwwuo,tinybubbles1234,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:16:23 2015 UTC,"How is it absurd or anywhere near racist? It's fairly simple to find data that confirms the income disparity between non-hispanic whites and hispanics is huge. I'm sorry if it pisses you off, but it's a fact.  What's absurd is that you continue to make illogical comparisons with too many variable factors and think you're proving some sort of point. You're just twisting data to fit your own ends. If anything you've only shown that they do similarly in Florida. Mexico vs Costa Rica in Orlando, FL drew 53k, you've already cited that USMNT vs Nigeria in Jacksonville, FL drew 52k. Neither of these matches was sold out, and the data that you've cited just shows they have similar drawing power at the moment in Florida. That has little correlation with potential drawing power in Atlanta, and less to do with drawing power in Nashville. I don't know what you're trying to prove here, but maybe a basic statistics class would help? You can't just throw out pairs of unrelated data sets and claim a conclusion."
ussoccer,3dwwuo,wolfmalfoy,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:33:04 2015 UTC,"And to add,  It is not a risk purchase for either US or mexico fans.  A person long ago could be very safe in assuming no matter what at least one  (usa or Mex) was going to be in one of the games.  Odds were very good both.  So a USA fan if the US does not make it sells the ticket for profit or break even to a mexican fan.  a mexico fan can also sell his ticket if mexico does not make it to a us fan.  It was a safe purchase months ago for either fan."

ussoccer,3e0cjz,MrDerpsicle,7,Tue Jul 21 07:18:27 2015 UTC,"I got into US soccer about 6 years ago, following my country of birth, Ireland on the runup to the WC.  Then Henry handballed Ireland out and I was down for anyone but France.  Mexico sent them packing, and I worked with a bunch of Mexicans, so I was happy to see them do well.  Of course, this was 2010 and Algeria and all, which was what put me over on rooting for the home team, because before 2009, I thought USSoccer was a dud, and Americans would never ""get it"".  So I walked into this thing with no reason to hate Mexico, and plenty of reason to like them.  And what did I see?  Fans that yell ""puto"", throw trash, and point lasers at players.  Players that whine, insult the ref, flop, and could get cards for excessive celebration on own goals.  A team that doesn't know how to play together in the final third, everyone thinks they are going to go for the goal of the century as soon as they get the ball.  No class, no humility, no ability to commit to players/staff through rough times.  I want to see a USA-MEX final so we can put a nail in this thing, but it will never be understood that Mexico's team is level with ours, and ours is more than the sum of its parts(and only going to get better).  But I know deep down that instead of making any kind of point, we'll hear an endless string of excuses about Chicharito's inury, it's Piojo's fault, this tournament doesn't matter, etc from the country that doesn't seem to possess an ""A"" team.  I wish this could be a Liverpool-Everton thing where both teams are really good in their own ways, but the fan and player culture around El Tri is barely family-friendly, and not inspiring to watch.  //End rant from South Texas"

ussoccer,3drre4,cybin,5,Sat Jul 18 21:19:42 2015 UTC,He spent about 20 years in England so he's caught in the middle of an American and English accent
ussoccer,3drre4,VonTrapps,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:59:46 2015 UTC,This is the answer I was looking for.  It still sounds more Irish than English tho (and I know Ireland is part of the UK)
ussoccer,3drre4,cybin,4,Sat Jul 18 22:07:45 2015 UTC,Northern Ireland is a part of the UK.

ussoccer,3drre4,cybin,-1,Sat Jul 18 22:24:00 2015 UTC,"The problem is there is an accent that's between the US and the UK, that people can develop, and that's not it."

ussoccer,3dt5fr,David21538,5,Sun Jul 19 15:02:59 2015 UTC,"He is using younger players with veterans.  Nobody thought he would do different.  Mixing in some youth to see what they got and if they perform maybe letting keep getting playing time but it seems to me to be a pretty veteran lineup. Bradley has played every min,  I think dempsey also,  Beckerman has what two full games?   He mixed in some new blood and played around a little in games that on paper were easy or had no bearing on position.   If a guy was on our wc roster he is a veteran player no matter his age.  You want to see younger and new faces wait till this tourny is over.  You will see what he means then."

ussoccer,3dsz3b,MrDerpsicle,3,Sun Jul 19 04:00:44 2015 UTC,The result has got to be as 50-50 as any game could be in this tournament.  Mexico look as always completely random in the way they play. 6-0 over Cuba but then give up a 4-4 game to T&T.   Costa Rica lost their coach from the World Cup that got them almost all the way to the Semi finals if it weren't for a couple of insane penalty saves from the Dutch. He is now with Honduras (lol).  Costa Rica has some seriously quality players and Mexico is almost always at least in the Semi's for the Gold Cup but this match has the quality of a final or semi final. I expect a close game with Mexico edging out Costa Rica by a bit.   Who the hell really knows though? I'm basically flipping a coin and guessing.

Zardes has been in good form, so he gets the start.  Zardes has played mostly LW though, will be interesting to see him on the R. I agree that Yedlin's role will be supersub.

ussoccer,3drmef,REDeadREVOLUTION,7,Sat Jul 18 20:13:59 2015 UTC,"Timmy is such an odd player. You can count on him to make a couple good attacking play per game, and they have ended in goals several times.  You can also count on him to make at least the same, if not double, the amount of defensive mistakes per games. And those often end up as goals.  I can see why Jurgen wanted him to work out. If he cuts down on the mistakes, he could be huge for us. And I've heard he's good at his club. But at this point, he just seems like a constant liability for the national team.   What I've always wondered is how he'd do at a midfield role. He's got some good passes, and had that one fantastic shot. If we were ever up enough in a unimportant game, I'd like to see it."

ussoccer,3dohme,DougieFFC,9,Fri Jul 17 23:12:33 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, I think the pay-to-play model forfeits the youth clubs of any moral right towards a share of the spoils of a player they helped develop, because they did not contribute either a share of the investment or a share of the risk. They developed the player for an agreed fee.  If you want to turn American youth soccer on its head, disincentivise the utterly absurd, counter-productive financial cost-of-entry that is the pay-to-play model. USA will never win a world cup whilst only the financially comfortable aren't discouraged from picking up the game."

ussoccer,3dohme,DougieFFC,8,Fri Jul 17 23:27:45 2015 UTC,"I read the whole article. It's a fanciful supposition to think that youth clubs will abandon the guaranteed thousands of dollars a year per player model for the possibility they may stumble upon the 1 in 10,000 player that yields a $4m transfer fee somewhere down the line. The sums do not even remotely add up, by several orders of magnitude. This isn't a solution to the problem, it's an incremental, lottery-like bonus for existing systems on top of what they already make. And no, from a moral perspective they aren't owed a single cent."
ussoccer,3dohme,DougieFFC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:46:45 2015 UTC,"When a handful of non-elite clubs have some of their poor players end up on huge teams, your theory that they'd cling to the existing system instead of modifying the status quo is similar supposition."
ussoccer,3dohme,skunkboy72,5,Fri Jul 17 23:52:19 2015 UTC,"It's very simple business sense. There are thousands of youth clubs for every million-dollar american soccer player. If you're a youth club, do you abandon a guaranteed revenue of, what, a couple hundred thousand dollars a year from your pay-to-play students, to pursue 5% of a payday that will never arrive at 99% of those youth clubs at the very least?  Businesses seldom abandon stability for high-risk, high-stakes, and in this case the potential returns are so unlikely (and so unspectacular even if successful) that no sensible business would choose to pursue them."

ussoccer,3diysd,108241,7,Thu Jul 16 18:09:17 2015 UTC,"10) bert patenaude, 1930  9) Abby Wambach, 2011  8) benny feilhaber, 2007  7) Brian McBride, 2002  6) Brandi Chastain, 1999  5) Earnie Stewart, 1994  4) Michelle Akers, 1991  3) Joe Gaetjens, 1950  2) Landon Donovan, 2010  1) Paul Caligiuri, 1989"
ussoccer,3diysd,j3zuz00,4,Thu Jul 16 19:19:03 2015 UTC,"I saw everything till #1, then had to zoom out because they didn't allow scrolling. SI has good articles from time to time, but they have absolutely awful website design."
ussoccer,3diysd,Saffs15,9,Thu Jul 16 22:40:34 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm partial to Eric Wynalda against Switzerland in 94... Game 1 and nobody expected the US to get a point, they were struggling against the Swiss defense, and then Wynalda unleashed a monster free kick that completely changed the outlook of the US team."
ussoccer,3diysd,j3zuz00,4,Thu Jul 16 17:30:41 2015 UTC,Here is a great video about Caligiuri's goal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-JP0uay6Aw
ussoccer,3diysd,evanb_,2,Thu Jul 16 19:20:19 2015 UTC,"The top four were as I expected, but reading about Michelle Akers's goal and the 1991 Cup was really interesting."
ussoccer,3diysd,ooter37,5,Fri Jul 17 05:59:58 2015 UTC,"Damn, Wambach only #9. That's right up there with Donovan's goal for me."
ussoccer,3diysd,PiGaKiLa,9,Thu Jul 16 18:05:59 2015 UTC,Agreed. 123rd minute of a knockout round in the World Cup with a perfect pass and header. Should definitely be near the top.
ussoccer,3diysd,FHlogin,0,Thu Jul 16 19:59:43 2015 UTC,not to mention that cross was sent in with Rapinoes NON DOMINANT FOOT!!
ussoccer,3diysd,OHILIKETHATTT,3,Fri Jul 17 16:28:41 2015 UTC,"BTW, I thought the same thing, but I think there's a bit of a bias to goals that we've seen. For me, Donovan against Algeria is the one that got my heart beating faster than any other."

ussoccer,3diysd,race_kerfuffle,2,Fri Jul 17 06:00:29 2015 UTC,"Interesting that Chastain is only at #6. When we are talking about significance that should be at, or near, the top, in my opinion. It transcended gender, and really made an entire generation see soccer as a viable option to play in the U.S. It was on network TV during the most watched soccer broadcast ever (and would be for another decade). That goal, the subsequent media, is still an iconic part of U.S. Soccer's history."
ussoccer,3diysd,ACCBiggz,3,Fri Jul 17 00:44:51 2015 UTC,And it wasn't even that goal.
ussoccer,3diysd,jhoop7,3,Fri Jul 17 02:58:26 2015 UTC,"Ah, you're right. Even more curious. Maybe they DQ'd it from the conversation because it was a PK? I didn't read the entire thing, but are there any PKs on the list? Odd."
ussoccer,3diysd,race_kerfuffle,2,Fri Jul 17 03:01:08 2015 UTC,"In the article about the Chastain goal they said:   For a variety of reasons, when compiling this list, penalties taken in shootouts were ruled out."
ussoccer,3diysd,BurningNation,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:25:47 2015 UTC,The whole story was about how the not-that-one goal was more important. It was weird.

ussoccer,3dkrqf,skunkboy72,4,Fri Jul 17 02:56:54 2015 UTC,It's just like any other sporting event except the crowd is a bit more vocal.  I know you can get official Gold Cup gear and they have USA shirts.
ussoccer,3dkrqf,TheCatWrangler,5,Fri Jul 17 15:27:18 2015 UTC,"The merch table at the one in Frisco only had Gold cup gear and some non-jersey stuff like t-shirts and I think a scarf.  Looking back, I wish I got a gold cup shirt, but I don't think it was for that game in particular, so I can still buy one and it'd be the same. You should know heading in that Cuba sucks, the ref is an idiot, everyone else is being too quiet because they are shy, NOBODY CAN STOP YOU FROM SCREAMING, THE TEAM CERTAINLY CAN HEAR YOU, AND THE ONLY RIGHT THING TO DO IS GET HYPED, BECAUSE USA IS GOING ALL THE WAY BABY, WE GOT THIS!!

So any ""pay to play"" situations would have that already deducted.  If USSF could help mandate a way to spend that money, say so much for scholarship, so much for coaches and facilities it would only help raise the level of development all around it seems.   Right now those transfers from MLS only help put money back into those clubs youth systems since they can't spend most of the revenue on salary. If they did this both Crossfire and Akron should get some money from the Yedlin sale as they both played a role in his development."
ussoccer,3dir6w,Dylema,3,Thu Jul 16 23:19:20 2015 UTC,so amateur teams are trying to cash in on the development of players who turn pro? This is absurd.

ussoccer,3dir6w,Foxcloud86,2,Fri Jul 17 16:15:54 2015 UTC,Considering how much those development programs charge just to participate makes it even more absurd.

It had been at least 5 years since he played for the Texans.  Why should they be compensated?  If he had gone right from the Texans to NE or Fulham than fine, but he didn't."
ussoccer,3dir6w,Dontmakemechoose2,-1,Fri Jul 17 14:37:54 2015 UTC,I think this will become a much larger issue as soccer grows in the US. Clubs deserve to be compensated for training players that eventually become professionals.
ussoccer,3dir6w,royalewithnocheese,6,Thu Jul 16 16:35:02 2015 UTC,"But not if its ""pay to play"" since clubs were already compensated."
ussoccer,3dir6w,xspixels,6,Thu Jul 16 16:57:37 2015 UTC,"exactly, if dempsey had to pay to be on that team, no way in hell should that team collect money off his future transfers"
ussoccer,3dir6w,royalewithnocheese,7,Thu Jul 16 19:07:45 2015 UTC,I think the only people who are in favor of this extra compensation work for these programs and want to try and further exploit players for money. This is like if I tutor students for the MCAT for $100/hour and then once some of these students become successful businessmen/businesswomen I argue to be compensated further.
ussoccer,3dir6w,Dontmakemechoose2,0,Thu Jul 16 19:28:50 2015 UTC,Clubs should only be compensated for a players development if the player is signed to a professional contract directly from the club.

ussoccer,3dgkat,it_turned_inside_out,5,Thu Jul 16 06:16:33 2015 UTC,"Yea, it technically means ""hooker"", and ending in the ""o"" instead of the ""a"" inherently means it's a ""male hooker"". But it's taken on a slang meaning which is quite bigoted.  Regardless, it's more the physical interfering with the field and play that I'm immediately concerned about.

I'm sure I'll never again witness a live game this amazing.   There were many chants that the young Mexican woman seated next to me refused to repeat because of the language. Mexico's 3rd and 4th goals caused a wild beer and soda shower, and being a gringo rooting for the Soca Warriors, meant than much of it was directed at me. I'd say 90-95% of the Mexican fans acted decently, but the ones that didn't give them a much-deserved bad reputation.   After the last-second equalizer by T&T, the Trini, Guatemalan, and American fans were even pretty shocked. It was a strange silence.  I noticed only one person wearing a Cuba t-shirt. Their finish was pretty amazing, too. There was only about 7 or so players to come off of the Cuban bench to celebrate after the final whistle. Their joy was palpable."

I'm worried about fighting the rush hour traffic to get to the stadium by 6pm.   Which would be a better way to get to the stadium, down I-85 from Lawrenceville or up 402 from Conyers? Alternatively, could I park somewhere in the suburbs (read: Indian Creek or Doraville) and take MARTA in? How safe would it be to leave my car there?"

Really traffic is so fucked coming through downtown between 4-7, I would trade getting stabbed on the train (this won't happen, don't worry) over sitting in traffic. You'll have to change trains at 5 points if you are coming in from the north, it is very easy though. Parking is as safe as anywhere you'd leave your car by the Dome so don't worry about that."

ussoccer,3dgubi,mystrymaster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:20:50 2015 UTC,"Mix really isn't a holding midfielder, though. At least not from what I've seen."
ussoccer,3dgubi,sickgrof,4,Thu Jul 16 15:22:53 2015 UTC,I agree that he isn't but he has played back there a couple of times and his aggression has started to increase and I think he can play back there.  He is a guy who I think needs to be on the field for us and he is currently a man without a position on this roster as it exists.  Zardes is better out wide left Bradley is better up front Bedoya is better out wide right
ussoccer,3dgubi,mystrymaster,2,Thu Jul 16 15:51:42 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Bradley is most definitely not better up front, we saw that very clearly in the World Cup. Bradley plays much better as a playmaker that can sit deep, see the whole field, and control the game."
ussoccer,3dgubi,sickgrof,2,Thu Jul 16 15:57:08 2015 UTC,Bradley up front isn't better than Bradley in the back but Bradley up front is better than Mix up front.
ussoccer,3dgubi,mystrymaster,3,Thu Jul 16 16:23:57 2015 UTC,"Again, I seriously disagree. I don't know which two players you watch, but Bradley at the base and Mix at the 10 is much, much better than the reverse."

ussoccer,3dgubi,mystrymaster,2,Thu Jul 16 16:34:48 2015 UTC,"Diskerud has one of the best ""goals scored per minute played"" stat for midfielders and can connect on creative passes going forward.  Bradley tends to turn around and sprint/pass backwards when he gets the ball too often.  Both are capable of playing the CAM role, but I would like to see Diskerud in the middle of the field with Bradley both sharing CDM and CAM roles."

ussoccer,3dh12f,JonVisc,9,Thu Jul 16 05:14:19 2015 UTC,"Here is the article:   Gyasi Zardes | Age: 23 | Position: Forward | Grade: A  After a so-so performance on the left wing in the Americans' 2-1, tournament-opening victory last week against Honduras, the LA Galaxy forward emerged as a game-changer in the Yanks' next two matches. His energy and attacking instincts were a revelation off the bench versus Haiti --it was Zardes' clever cutback pass that set up Clint Dempsey's winner-- and he was also involved in the buildup to the lone U.S. goal on Monday, a match he started up top.  It might not be the last time we see Zardes at forward. The Californian's preferred position (and the one he plays in MLS) is striker. While he might not offer the back-to-goal hold-up play of target man Jozy Altidore -- who was released from the U.S. roster on Tuesday after failing to regain adequate fitness following a hamstring injury -- Zardes' ability to run at and stretch opposing defenses opens up space for Dempsey and other U.S. attackers.  Aron Johannsson | 24 | Position: Forward | Grade: B  Johannsson got a rare start against Haiti (just his sixth in 13 international games) and scored a well-taken goal that was nullified by an erroneous offside call. It was the Icelandic-American's only shot on target in the match, but he was involved throughout, missing on a spectacular bicycle-kick attempt off a Dempsey cross and showing intelligent movement in and around the box during his 83 minutes on the field.  ""Fitness-wise, I keep improving day by day,"" Johannsson, who hadn't played in a month, said afterward. With Altidore on the bench against Panama, it was somewhat surprising to see Chris Wondolowski in the lineup alongside Zardes. But Johannsson was dangerous in 20 minutes of action off the bench against the Canaleros. With his match fitness getting better, he could have a bigger role to play in the knockout stage.  DeAndre Yedlin | 22 | Position: Defender | Grade: B  It's been an interesting tournament for Yedlin, who was the breakout American player at last summer's World Cup. After starting in the first game of this Gold Cup, the Tottenham Hotspur prospect sat against Haiti and was again left out of Klinsmann's lineup for the first-round finale. But with the Americans trailing 1-0 to Panama 45 minutes into Monday's match, Yedlin was inserted, along with former Seattle Sounders' teammate Dempsey, to start the second half. The coach was immediately rewarded, with the fleet-footed Yedlin creating space by adding some badly needed width on the left.  This super-sub role isn't new for Yedlin -- all three of his appearances at Brazil 2014 came off the bench -- and given the emphatic return of veteran midfielder Alejandro Bedoya against Panama, it's a role he figures to deliver in Saturday's quarterfinal in Baltimore.  John Brooks | 22 | Position: Defender | Grade: B-  Brooks continues to show both immense promise and maddening inconsistency, which shouldn't be any shock given his age and the position he plays, center back, makes mistakes stand out.  Monday's tilt was more of the same. The towering German-American couldn't avoid picking up the second yellow that will rule him out of Saturday's win-or-go-home affair, and he lost Canaleros striker Blas Perez on the play that put Panama in front. But Brooks helped lock things down during the second half, and he was dominant at times like he was in the Americans' first match.  With Brooks unavailable in Baltimore, Tim Ream is expected to get the call. But even if Ream acquits himself well and helps the U.S. advance to the July 22 semifinal this Saturday, expect Brooks to return to the lineup with a final on the line in Atlanta.  Mix Diskerud | 24 | Midfielder | Grade: C+  It's somewhat surprising that Diskerud -- who had started nine of the 10 U.S. games he was available for heading into the Gold Cup -- has played just once so far. The New York City FC playmaker went the distance against the Haitians but didn't have his best night. He improved in the second half after a dismal first, firing a dangerous long-range shot on goal, drawing two fouls and completing 50 of 55 passes overall.  Still, it's hard to see where he fits into the lineup if Klinsmann is committed to playing Kyle Beckerman and Michael Bradley in the middle in the do-or-die games to come, which he probably is. Diskerud was spread out wide against Haiti. But Bedoya's return means there's now even more competition in a spot that Yedlin, Johannsson, Fabian Johnson and Graham Zusi could all be considered for.  Greg Garza | 23 | Defender | Grade: C+  Garza was added to the roster after Brad Davis (knee) withdrew, and he was one of three players switched out on Tuesday. (Altidore and Alfredo Morales were the others.) Like Diskerud, Garza played in just one of the three U.S. matches, starting and going 67 minutes on Friday in Foxborough.  The Mexican-based left back performed adequately going forward -- it was his smart, diagonal pass that sprung Zardes on the sequence that led to Dempsey's finish -- but he struggled at times at his own end. Still, Klinsmann made it clear Garza will be back. ""He's an emerging player-Greg Garza is there for the future,"" Klinsmann said after announcing the roster change. ""He's only getting better.""  Ventura Alvarado | 22 | Defender | Grade: C  Alvarado made blatant errors that led to two goals in the group stage: He got caught in no-man's land just before Carlos Discua fired in Honduras' first in the curtain-raiser, and he was undressed by Panama's Luis Tejada before Tejada found Perez on Monday.  Like Brooks, Alvarado improved after the break. ""I think both Ventura and also John, they grew with every minute,"" Kllinsmann said. ""There were some situations that were shaky in the first half and they cleaned it up. They were absolutely on top of things.""  That doesn't mean Alvarado will keep his place for the quarterfinal. With Brooks unavailable, Klinsmann may opt to put Omar Gonzalez next to the smooth-passing Ream. Not only did the pair pitch a shutout while partnered together against Haiti, but Gonzalez adds a physical, aerial presence that will be needed with Brooks out."

He's not going to play very many games with Muller, Gotze, Douglas Costa, Ribery, Robben, and Shian Kurt(19 year old prospect) there as attacking midfielders."
ussoccer,3dh4jw,jreese319,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:54:45 2015 UTC,"Saying that he will never be called up to the USMNT and never going to play for Bayern's first team is a very bold statement considering how young he is and how talented he is. And I don't think it is correct. He hasn't shown anything for the US because he hasn't gotten many opportunities. And when he did get an opportunity (against Belgium), he scored a goal with one of his first touches. And I don't believe that the fact he is coming up through Bayern has anything to do with his opportunities with the national team. Klinsmann is a good enough manager to recognize talent when he sees it. So if Jürgen feels as if he's talented enough to make an impact for us, then Julian will get his chance, regardless of what club team he plays for."
ussoccer,3dh4jw,MrDerpsicle,5,Thu Jul 16 14:54:32 2015 UTC,"He needs to go out on a couple of loans and prove that he can play with the Bayern first team when he's done.  I think his first step should be  a year long loan to the Eredivisie. It's a league where attackers tend to prosper. I think he should go to one of three clubs. PSV, AZ, or Utrecht. PSV because it's a high profile club, and if he really wants to showcase his talent to Bayern, that should be taken into consideration Plus, Memphis Depay is leaving, and Green is a very similar player to Depay.However, it's probably harder to play for their first team than for most other Dutch clubs. AZ would be a good choice because Earnie Stewart is their American technical director and he has overseen both Altidore's and Johannsson's stints  there, which have both been successes. Plus, they could use some support on the wings. Utrecht is another option and might be the safest one because his old Bayern youth coach(who he did exceptionally well under) is their new head coach, and he likely both has a soft spot for Green and would play a system similar to Bayern. Plus, he could develop chemistry with Rubio Rubin, another young American attacker.  After that, I think he should be loaned out for a year to a top three Portuguese side. Sporting CP, Benfica, or Porto. They are all but guaranteed places in the Champions League, and being on a CL side  where you can expect to start every game is especially invaluable for a youngster  These three Portuguese clubs can market themselves to Americans better with one of their own there and can sell jerseys. The Portuguese League is about midway between the EPL and the Eredivisie in terms of difficulty so it's a nice transition.  His last loan should be half a season long, to a decent EPL side like Everton or Spurs. By this time, he's already a proven commodity in Europe, assuming that he starts for the loaned teams and the loans are otherwise successful. However, Bayern is an elite club and he'll still have a little but of trouble breaking into the first team. By playing half a season in the toughest league in the world for a decent team, he'll really drive home his point and show that he's ready for whatever might come his way at Bayern.  He returns to Bayern in 2018. Franck Ribery will be 35, and Arjen Robben will be 34. They might even have moved on to MLS by now. Julian can finally claim a starting role in Bayern Munich's first team, at the age of 22,alongside Thomas Muller and Douglas Costa as an attacking midfielder.  This is how big clubs develop their prospects. This is what Arsenal did to Carlos Vela, for example."
ussoccer,3dh4jw,OverviewEffect,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:49:17 2015 UTC,"I like this, but ultimately I dont think he will be at Bayern.   I want to see him in Eredivsie, Belgian League, or Portuguese league. PSV might be good but I agree that Ultrecht would be great for him.   I think if he was loaned out to EPL teams and shined enough to be brought back to bayern he would also have shined enough to get attention from EPL/La Liga teams and would make the move. I believe this because I think 2018 is too late a time frame for Bayern to find their next two wingers. Also Pep probably wont be at Bayern in 2018, so the dependence on wingers may not be there. Either way I think his future is limited with Bayern unless he really has a break out couple of years on Loan. Most likely he will end up being a decent winger/ striker in a two man system for and midtier EPL/Serie A/Bundes team.   This would still be big for US and he could still have a massive impact for the US team as I can see him finding inspiration in the admiration the US fans can give him."
ussoccer,3dh4jw,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:46:27 2015 UTC,"So you think that after he completes his stint at Everton/Spurs, he could stay there? Or maybe get interest from Serie A teams like AC/Inter and move there? Obviously this woulnd't be as great for US Soccer as having a stating ayer on Bayern's first team, but I could d see it working out in the end."
ussoccer,3dh4jw,OverviewEffect,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:30:16 2015 UTC,"I dont see him at either of those teams. Maybe spurs but doubt it. Somewhere like Southampton, Crystal Palace, or Stoke. Maybe Bolasie's replacement after next year. If Bolasie plays well this year, hell move on, if Julian place well where he is loaned he could be picked up by them.   This is entirely speculation and I am mostly talking out my ass and where I would like to see him if Bayern is not realistically an option."
ussoccer,3dh4jw,Dylema,2,Fri Jul 17 20:06:14 2015 UTC,"I think he goes down to a second division side this year.  He needs games and I'd rather see him do really well down a division then not playing for a Bundesliga team.  I'm starting to wonder which American attacker will be the first to hold down a starting role in the Bundesliga; Green, Wood, Gyau, Flores, Boyd, or Pulisic."
ussoccer,3dh4jw,MrDerpsicle,2,Thu Jul 16 22:57:12 2015 UTC,"Wood, Union Berlin have a good chance of getting promoted next year (knock on wood)"
ussoccer,3dh4jw,Dylema,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:27:09 2015 UTC,RB Leipzig have a chance as well I'd say. So Boyd could make it and Gyau is hopefully back to full health next year.
ussoccer,3dh4jw,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:57:18 2015 UTC,I doubt that Gyau will play much at all next year even if he fully recovers.
ussoccer,3dh4jw,Dylema,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:17:35 2015 UTC,Probably just wishful thinking.  I'm also not sure if he'll ever get to the level he could have been if not for the injury.  Kind of a big time in a players career for growth usually.
ussoccer,3dh4jw,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:09:57 2015 UTC,Let's loan him out to AZ and see how he does....
ussoccer,3dh4jw,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:10:50 2015 UTC,"Also, technically, Fabian is an attacker since he plays on the wing for Gladbach."

ussoccer,3dfrtx,jesandma,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:16:04 2015 UTC,"As I said, if they make a special version for the US, it could happen. The issue, however, is that they're probably not gonna make a cover with the entire team. If anything it will have on or two of the players. Part of this campaign wants to get the entire team on the cover which is what I am saying won't happen, unless someone gets some serious cash"
ussoccer,3dfrtx,mockio77,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:32:28 2015 UTC,I don't know - I could see it happening. They make a unique cover per country anyways - why not capitalize on the recent world cup winners while they are already trying to capture a new market with women?
ussoccer,3dfrtx,jesandma,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:29:40 2015 UTC,"The only way it would happen is if they did a limited run alongside a copy with Messi or something. Messi has a contract with them meaning he'll have to appear on the cover. I'm all for throwing Morgan or Wambach up there with him but to suggest that the official, main cover for North America will be either the whole USWNT or a shot of one of them with nobody else simply doesn't take the business side of things into account. And as we all know, the business side is what really matters for people like EA or FIFA."
ussoccer,3dgtrk,Salina11,3,Thu Jul 16 04:00:47 2015 UTC,"I've been discussing this myself with my soccer friends.  This is how I'm interpreting this whole ""the men and women's team share the same jersey""...which by the way, I think is fantastic.  There are Men's jerseys (obviously with no stars) and women's jersey with 3 stars.  Nike has also made a Men and Female's fan version of either team.  So if you're seeing any male wearing the new jersey's with 3 stars, it's a USWNT supporting jersey...for a man.  I know that sounds very confusing but it's the only logical explanation."

ussoccer,3des7x,kaicyr21,12,Wed Jul 15 18:54:07 2015 UTC,"The reffing from this region gets in reputation for a reason. Perfect example is the ref that officiated the most recent US game against Panama. He made headlines not even a month ago at the Copa America when Messi complained that he was getting chewed up by the other team by responding:  ""We play a different game in the Americas, I will let it happen.""   The unfortunate thing is that if different regions are more in favor of physical play (Read: Dirty) then when those regions refs get in a game it's going to be disgusting to watch as penalties are ignored, hacks are allowed throughout the game, and players are allowed to be injured.  On top of everything else CONCACAF refs not only allow dirty play but are notorious for being some of the worst refs in the world missing blatant offside calls, calling back legitimate goals, calling fouls completely the wrong way, the list goes on.  The only reason I watch the Gold Cup is because it's a competitive tournament for the US to play in, the surrounding bits of it are mind numbingly awful.  TLDR - Fuck CONCACAF and it play/ref style"

Let's point out a few things, we often bring in more senior players after the group stage, as to some other top tier teams.  The level of play is about to improve dramatically.  Second, and this is important, this is an off year for the GC, which is a ""flaw"" in how the system works, but that itself is why you are seeing a whole slew of significantly less experienced players seeing some serious game time.   These two factors alone will have a drastic results on games. The Copa de America in the US will be treated at a WC level and be amazing."

ussoccer,3des7x,irishstevenj,4,Wed Jul 15 18:51:40 2015 UTC,"You are 100% right, these tournaments really are where the guys who aren't going to play at the higher levels use to try to ""prove"" that the big guys aren't so tough and the level of physicality is awful which causes some of the best players to even get jittery with their passes and first touches.  it's not good soccer.

Rewatching the play he does give up ball side, but it's not like him and the player were in a 1v1 battle and Alvarado lost.  Initially that player was being covered by Brooksy and when Brooks hightailed it to cover the ball carrier that left Alvarado's man open for a split second during the marking hand off.  Alvarado should've been a little quicker to react, but we're talking about a split second response.  It's easy to point it out when you have an instant replay looped for you to watch over and over again versus live.  And it being a goal against a better team, Brooks still took the ball away here, so that point is kind of moot.  Too many what if's."
ussoccer,3d9ccf,FunkyMonkeyBanana,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:59:01 2015 UTC,"It's not really moot though because at better team (like Portugal) ill exploit that lack of coverage every time. It's definitely easier to say it after seeing it on replay but as a professional international CB, you should know to cover the man rushing into the box and close down the lane."
ussoccer,3d9ccf,TonyzTone,13,Fri Jul 17 05:32:52 2015 UTC,"I said it last night, but as much as Brooks kind of sucked in the first half I was really happy with his play in the second half. Shame we won't be seeing him next game"
ussoccer,3d9ccf,Brobi_WanKenobi,3,Tue Jul 14 15:44:12 2015 UTC,I have said this in another thread but it always seems like he's worried about the right side of the defense because of how weak it is. I always see him looking over and tbh I would trust Chandler and Alvarado. I just hope we see Omar and Brooks soon.
ussoccer,3d9ccf,FrostyGrass,11,Wed Jul 15 03:26:07 2015 UTC,"Absolutely love this. He played it perfect, well done Brooks! This kids got a lot of potential"
ussoccer,3d9ccf,tomakazi3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:35:44 2015 UTC,Statistically one of the best defenders in the Bundesliga last season.

ussoccer,3d9ccf,beach-bum,7,Tue Jul 14 16:31:18 2015 UTC,I like how you can tell he was lining that tackle up 15 yards before. Similar to a good chase down block in the NBA always great to see the full run up to that
ussoccer,3d9ccf,IKetchBodies,4,Tue Jul 14 18:06:10 2015 UTC,Had to get that one perfect.  Highlight reel stuff
ussoccer,3d9ccf,3kindsofsalt,5,Tue Jul 14 15:36:28 2015 UTC,"That tackle was f'in legitimate, and on a very real scoring play by Panama.  I like our guys playing a real game even though we were already through, the second half was great to watch them grit that tie out."
ussoccer,3d9ccf,ThreeOneFive,2,Tue Jul 14 17:08:20 2015 UTC,"I screamed ""What a tackle!""  Wife looks up from computer at me ""There's no tackling in soccer.""  I rewind and replay the tackle, her reply was ""Ohh WOW that was amazing!"""
ussoccer,3d9ccf,Ryanh1985,2,Tue Jul 14 23:06:09 2015 UTC,I WAS THERE! I don't think I'd ever heard so many people cheer so loud for a slide tackle.
ussoccer,3d9ccf,neverfux92,2,Tue Jul 14 23:46:03 2015 UTC,I missed the game last night so correct me if I'm wrong but from here it looks like he tripped the guy up with his hands a bit?
ussoccer,3d9ccf,bterre108,4,Tue Jul 14 16:37:24 2015 UTC,"No, made contact with the ball first and then the guy fell on him.  So long as the initial contact is clean and you're carrying through with momentum from that tackle, it's not a foul."
ussoccer,3d9ccf,ThreeOneFive,2,Tue Jul 14 17:09:37 2015 UTC,And it's judged not to be dangerous.

The fact that Haiti finished higher than Panama and Honduras speaks to the over hype."
ussoccer,3d9yfz,AbsolutXero,25,Tue Jul 14 19:06:57 2015 UTC,Is Matt Besler dead or do we really think Alvarado is more useful than him?
ussoccer,3d9yfz,RoxorzBoxorz,11,Tue Jul 14 17:34:19 2015 UTC,"consensus seems to be that Klinsmann sees the LF dominant CB and RF dominant CB as two different roles. Brooks and Besler would be battling for LF dominant CB, and Klinsmann rates Brooks higher in that regard"
ussoccer,3d9yfz,paperclipscientist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:13:30 2015 UTC,That's fair enough. But at some point even a defender on the weaker side is better than the revolving door Alvarado has shown himself to be. Hope I'm wrong though.
ussoccer,3d9yfz,RoxorzBoxorz,6,Tue Jul 14 19:57:08 2015 UTC,revolving door   What do you mean?
ussoccer,3d9yfz,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:47:25 2015 UTC,He lets in goals like a revolving door.
ussoccer,3d9yfz,skunkboy72,2,Wed Jul 15 00:25:38 2015 UTC,"I'm going to guess Klinsmann is committed to playing the CBs in pairs. I'm expecting a Johnson Ream Gonzales Beasley back line in the next game. Unless they dominate that game, Brooks and Alvarado I would think would finish the tournament as the starters."
ussoccer,3d9yfz,simpleparadox,7,Tue Jul 14 19:15:14 2015 UTC,"I like the moves.  Jozy is not fit.  He wasn't confident and needs to get his timing back.  Gordon is a big forward who can play the final 10 min for set pieces. Zardes showed enough upfront (when Demsey was with him) that he can make an impact.  Garza didn't show he was better than the steadiness Beasley can provide.  Chandler stays since he's been able to create threats down the line (especially with Yedlin).  Same goes for Morales for Corona.  Good for Morales to get the experience in the group stage, but now the real tournament begins.  Hiccups aren't allowed anymore, and Corona will be steady from experience."
ussoccer,3d9yfz,toddozie,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:01:05 2015 UTC,"Gordon is a one trick pony which isn' t even that good at that one trick. Using him like Bob Bradley used Connor Casey just isn't going to work against good teams. I'd much rather have a multi-dimensional attacker like Agudelo on the team.  Also, I can't of a single reason Corona should be on the roster ahead of Morales."
ussoccer,3d9yfz,MrDerpsicle,6,Tue Jul 14 20:51:56 2015 UTC,Yeah guys I was way the fuck off this is a huge surprise. Why not just bring in Beasley in the beginning if you weren't gonna use garza?
ussoccer,3d9yfz,OHILIKETHATTT,19,Tue Jul 14 17:37:49 2015 UTC,Garza played 1 game and is now cap tied to the U.S.
ussoccer,3d9yfz,MyFaucetsIsMoenNigga,4,Tue Jul 14 17:52:03 2015 UTC,I didn't know he wasn't cap tied already. Suddenly that makes a lot of sense.
ussoccer,3d9yfz,boredinproperty,3,Tue Jul 14 19:08:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I didn't know that either. Was even considering anyone else?
ussoccer,3d9yfz,OHILIKETHATTT,2,Tue Jul 14 19:49:32 2015 UTC,He holds both an American and a Mexican passport (by way of his father who was born in Mexico) so he could have played for Mexico
ussoccer,3d9yfz,MyFaucetsIsMoenNigga,9,Tue Jul 14 19:56:00 2015 UTC,"To me, the 7 points justify Beasley not being included in the group stage.  Jurgen wanted to see how Garza and Chandler would react to being the only two LBs on the roster.  They struggled.  Beasley was a fallback plan for this exact case for when the games became do-or-die.  It was a great idea because it gave the two backs experience in a scenario with minimal risk."
ussoccer,3d9yfz,toddozie,5,Tue Jul 14 17:53:55 2015 UTC,"Eh, you're right about Chandler struggling, but Johnson was the first left back not Chandler. He was the first Right back. This move means we can move him to RB."
ussoccer,3d9yfz,Taeshan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:02:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, you're right!  Thanks for correcting"
ussoccer,3d9yfz,toddozie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:21:20 2015 UTC,Rested Beasley to. You made good points
ussoccer,3d9yfz,OHILIKETHATTT,11,Tue Jul 14 19:48:34 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that Beasley is coming out of retirement. We should start him at LB and Johnson at RB. That way we don't need Chandler anymore for this tournament.  That being said, Corona and Gordon are real head scratchers. I really wouldn't have taken out Morales in the first place; he showed last night to be a pretty competent bob-to-box mid. As for the Jozy replacement, why not just call up Agudello? Gordon doesn't even start in MLS, what the hell is he doing on our national team? I doubt that Corona start in Liga MX, might as well call up Perry Kitchen."
ussoccer,3d9yfz,MrDerpsicle,4,Tue Jul 14 17:49:34 2015 UTC,"Gordon has some of that nastiness that we've been lacking. Dempsey has it, but Johannsson and Zardes just aren't wired that way. Gordon is coming in if we need a brawler in the box to get on the end of crosses.  He isn't coming in to start. He isn't coming in to play 90. That's not what he does. He is there to do dirty work."
ussoccer,3d9yfz,DLev45,2,Tue Jul 14 19:16:10 2015 UTC,"Still. He barely even plays for the Galaxy. He's 33 and not getting any younger. If he was a bench warmer in, say,EPL or Bundesliga, I'd understand. But if someone doesn't start in MLS or an equivalent league (Championship, 2nd div bundesliga, Scandinavia) they have no business playing for our national team. I don't care how many minutes he plays, he's a waste of a roster spot which could go to someone infinitely more valuable.   Agudelo might be that tough guy striker you're looking for. He's bigger than Jozy(6'3 185 pounds vs 6'1 175 pounds) and holds up the ball well. If we need a blue collar attacker who does the dirty work, we have Bedoya and Zardes."
ussoccer,3d9yfz,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:43:43 2015 UTC,So he's coming to be Conor Casey?
ussoccer,3d9yfz,blackgallagher87,5,Tue Jul 14 23:26:08 2015 UTC,"Morales is now cap-tied to the US, so that was the reason for his inclusion (and why we don't need him for the rest of the tourney)"
ussoccer,3d9yfz,paperclipscientist,2,Tue Jul 14 19:14:50 2015 UTC,I see him being really valuable in the future. He was one of the best players on a team which made it's way to the Bundesliga. We should gear him up to be the future Jermaine Jones: a box to box CDM who pops up everywhere and causes trouble for the other team's attacking midfielders. I don't see how Corona is an improvement at all.
ussoccer,3d9yfz,MrDerpsicle,2,Tue Jul 14 20:46:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed, we need a Beckerman/Jones replacement. Maybe he is going out so that he can return to his team and start gearing up for the new Bundes season?"
ussoccer,3d9yfz,paperclipscientist,2,Tue Jul 14 21:01:35 2015 UTC,"Makes sense,  newly promoted teams often have an uphill struggle and if it means having all their players participate in some kind of preseason camp, then so be it."

ussoccer,3d92ie,MrDerpsicle,5,Tue Jul 14 13:54:06 2015 UTC,I think Agudelo has done well enough to get a call.   But right now I'd like to see Johannson get a start or two. He's impressed so far when he is on. He's very smart with his runs and seems to mesh well with Bradley and Dempsey.
ussoccer,3d92ie,chico_warren,5,Tue Jul 14 13:55:57 2015 UTC,I agree. This is ArJo's shot to make a strong impression and show what we have all been hoping to see from him.

ussoccer,3dcj5b,vb622,3,Wed Jul 15 05:06:31 2015 UTC,"Among the third place teams, Panama will face Jamaica in the quarters. El Salvador have already finished their group stage: they have no more games to play; they have 2 points, a -1 goal differential, and 1 goal scored. Guatemala has 1 point and a -2 goal differential, with 1 goal scored.  Mexico plays Trinidad and Tobago. and Guatermala plays Cuba. There is a slim chance we will play Mexico in the quarter final, and it goes like this; Mexico has a +6 goal difference. They will need to lose to T&T, and Guatermala will have to win against Cuba. But to overcome the 8 goal differential between itself and Mexico, Guatermala will either have to win really big against Cuba, or Mexico will have to lose really bad against T&T. 8-0 Guatermala-Cuba and 0-1 Mexico-T&T is an option. 0-8 Mexico-T&T is another option. 5-0 Guatermala-Cuba and 4-0 T&T-Mexico is an option. Obviously, this is a very unlikely scenario, but anything can happen. Now, if Cuba wins against Guatermala, we might play them in the quarters.  If Guatermala wins against Cuba but not something outlandish enough to relegate Mexico to third place, then we play them in the quarters.  If Guatermala draws Cuba, then we face El Salvador in the quarter finals.  Assuming we win against Cuba, El Salvador, or Guatermala (Mexico?), we play the winner of Haiti vs Jamaica in the semis. Assuming we win against them, we're in the GC final.  Now, who do we play in the final? In the quarters, the winner of Group C (T&T?Mexico?) will play Panama. Whoever loses between T&T and Mexico(Guatermala?) will play Costa Rica. So then, the winner of T&T/Mexico and Panama will play the winner of T&T/Mexico and Costa Rica.

ussoccer,3d7ysm,constantlyoff,32,Tue Jul 14 05:36:00 2015 UTC,i agreed with the telecast. foul outside the box and probably a red card for denying a goal scoring opportunity.
ussoccer,3d7ysm,badgramajama,-10,Tue Jul 14 06:41:46 2015 UTC,Not a red. To deny a goal scoring opportunity there are 4 d's  number of defenders distance to goal distance to ball direction of play  He had two defenders running along side him.  Yellow card and DFK at most.
ussoccer,3d7ysm,Cowkillah25,2,Tue Jul 14 16:04:59 2015 UTC,"Number of defenders: 3 behind Bedoya, only the goalie in front.  Distance to goal: 19 yards.  Distance to ball: at his feet.  Direction of play: right at goal.  How can you argue it's not a red?"
ussoccer,3d7ysm,DavDoubleu,2,Tue Jul 14 21:21:15 2015 UTC,"There are two defenders within a yard of him, catching up. The trail defender is about 10 yards away when the foul occurs.  I'm not denying the foul. But I don't believe it's a red. I don't think it meets the 4 D's and the contact isn't excessive.  It's a tactical foul and a yellow card DFK."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,Cowkillah25,-2,Tue Jul 14 22:29:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually don't think this was a clear case of a foul. Granted I didn't see the game so I'm not sure what came before this but just from this .gif, it was 50/50. I've seen plenty of games where this does get called and plenty where it doesn't.  I just hope that the USMNT doesn't become a cry baby team spurred on by the fans. We've been historically treated like shit which is why our players are awesome. But let's call it fair, shall we?"
ussoccer,3d7ysm,TonyzTone,-3,Wed Jul 15 03:34:42 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who thought this wasn't really a foul, or could at least see how this is a non-PK call? Bedoya kind of just cut in front of him and initiated the contact and the guy just kept running normally, which resulted in a knee to the back of Bedoyas knee and him falling.  Honestly Bedoya kind of pushed his arm and turned him when he felt him come up from behind.  All in all, seemed like more physical play than a PK/Foul to me, even as a US fan, though i'm not expecting to get a neutral point of view from /r/ussoccer"
ussoccer,3d7ysm,Duffman5755,3,Wed Jul 15 03:14:48 2015 UTC,"It might not be a pk but it is a foul for sure. If a player is in front of you, you can't just run into the back of him/run into his legs, that is a foul. He wasn't playing the ball at all."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,Duffman5755,-1,Wed Jul 15 03:52:33 2015 UTC,"The way I saw it wasn't the guy running into the back of him, but more Bedoya seeing the guy coming from the side and just stepping in front of him and cutting him off a little (mostly just putting his arm out).  Watch it again, Bedoya sees/feels his hand and then starts pushing his arm/shoulder and he kind of goes sideways, and that caused him to run into the back of his leg.  Just seems like mutual contact to me, but I've absolutely seen far less get called in games."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,FunkyMonkeyBanana,2,Wed Jul 15 04:05:49 2015 UTC,"All of that hand contact and shoulder bumping is a part of the game.  Technically the hand contact can be called, too, but it never is.  Bedoya is ahead of the players, which gives him the right of way to take that angle and the defender is being boxed out.  The onus is on the defender to make a play on the ball WITHOUT fouling at this point, which doesn't happen.  #3 is who actually takes Bedoya down not the defender who stays on his feet and he does it by directly making contact with the back of Bedoya's calf.  There's no embellishment or dive here, it's a clear cut foul."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,xspixels,15,Wed Jul 15 15:08:26 2015 UTC,how in the hell was there no call?
ussoccer,3d7ysm,3kindsofsalt,12,Tue Jul 14 12:16:03 2015 UTC,"Mexican ref, Mexcian second official"
ussoccer,3d7ysm,jackofalltrades723,13,Tue Jul 14 14:41:31 2015 UTC,More like it's a CONCACAF official. They've either given us an official with 2 games under his belt or a salty Mexican to officiate our games. The calls are terrible. They are either being paid to swing the calls or they are truly that inadequate. Both are terrifying tbh.
ussoccer,3d7ysm,emcb1230,8,Tue Jul 14 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"you know it's bad when the defender comes up with his ""i didn't do it"" hands."

ussoccer,3d7ysm,Brett858,3,Tue Jul 14 15:26:10 2015 UTC,"straight red.  he was behind the last defender when he got tripped.  the other guy was catching up, but only got alongside as bedoya was falling."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,E51838,2,Tue Jul 14 16:58:10 2015 UTC,"If you're not going to call this a foul as the ref (though not sure why you'd think it wasn't), you have to give a yellow for diving."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,kyldare,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:44:42 2015 UTC,Beautiful touch into space from Bedoya to deny two defenders any play on the ball. Perfect weight and placement.  Should have been a call though (obviously).
ussoccer,3d7ysm,ooter37,-4,Tue Jul 14 20:54:03 2015 UTC,"Definitely a trip, and should have been called. At the same time, Bedoya took a dive trying to get the call. If you watch closely, he maintains his balance just fine after taking his next step, but then decided to drag his right foot and fall down instead of continuing his run. In my perfect dream world, I'd throw them both out with reds because I hate fouls like that and I hate dives."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,E51838,2,Tue Jul 14 19:43:16 2015 UTC,He doesn't drag his right foot. He gets kicked in the back of the legs.
ussoccer,3d7ysm,ooter37,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:45:04 2015 UTC,"Watch in slow motion. Completely after the contact, he plants his right foot. He's fine at that point. No more contact is made. He then drags his toes on his right foot, initiating the dive. He also does it with his left foot after. I'm not saying it wasn't a foul, but he very likely could have stayed on his feet. Instead, he was more interested in trying to draw the call. If he knew 100% he wouldn't be receiving a call, he wouldn't have gone down like that.     EDIT: Here, I made a screenshot (though I still recommend watching in slow motion because it makes it really obvious). http://imgur.com/Hh1iVce You don't drag your toes in the ground like that when you're trying to stay up lol"
ussoccer,3d7ysm,E51838,2,Wed Jul 15 00:22:44 2015 UTC,"Just because someone doesn't immediately go down, it doesn't make it a dive. Sometimes when someone gets tripped they're able to take a step or two, but their balance is so thrown off, they're not going to be able to correct it. Like when they are running full speed and get kicked the back of the legs."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,ooter37,0,Wed Jul 15 00:30:11 2015 UTC,"Ya, sometimes that's what happens. It's not what happened here though. Watch it in slow motion, and then give me an explanation as to why someone would dig their toes into the ground if they weren't trying to fall down.    EDIT: Again, I'm not saying it wasn't a foul. I'm just saying, Bedoya was more concerned with making it clear that it was a foul than staying on his feet and trying to score the goal."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,E51838,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:37:35 2015 UTC,"As he's going to put his right foot down, he gets clipped, which is why he's not able to put it down flat and falls down. By calling it a dive, you are saying it wasn't a foul."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,ooter37,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:54:03 2015 UTC,"As he's going to put his right foot down, he gets clipped, which is why he's not able to put it down flat and falls down.       He does put it down flat though, right before he drags his toes.   By calling it a dive, you are saying it wasn't a foul.      No, I'm not. Not sure why you think there can't be a foul and a dive on the same play, but I assure you, there can, and very often is."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,E51838,2,Wed Jul 15 00:58:47 2015 UTC,If you really think this is a dive I really have no idea what to tell you. Both of his legs are kicked as he is running full speed. Every player is going down on this play. This is a clear foul that a competent or non-biased referee would call.
ussoccer,3d7ysm,ooter37,0,Wed Jul 15 01:02:51 2015 UTC,https://imgflip.com/gif/o7ptn Made a slow motion gif for you. Watch that and tell me he tries to stay on his feet.

ussoccer,3d7ysm,quacainia,-29,Tue Jul 14 06:47:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a US fan and I want us to win, and despite watching this like 20 times I don't see how it's a red card. They're shoving shoulders which is legal. The farthest Panamanian from the camera (5) nudges his teammate (3) to the right, which makes his hips turn and he is forced to step behind Bedoya, and legs collide. After a rewatch there was no contact from 3 and 5. The dude just got close, was trying to step forward while Bedoya was kicking back. It wasn't even a tackle, just a misplaced step. I could see an incidental contact foul, but hardly a red card since it was just that, incidental.  Not to mention, the ref was hardly calling anything the whole game. When people fell unless it was a rough tackle, then he would play on. That's his style, and judging by the lack of security of this collision, it goes along with all the other falls he wasn't calling the entire game.  What then am I missing that everyone else is screaming about?"
ussoccer,3d7ysm,burbod01,23,Tue Jul 14 07:38:12 2015 UTC,"He's the last man and he's tackling him from behind. They aren't shoving shoulders. Bedoya had him beat, and even if the ""tackle"" wasn't intentional, it was reckless to clip him from behind like that. I don't mind if he doesn't give a red, but he should have called a foul (though if he does call the foul he would be hard-pressed not to give a red)."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,quacainia,-24,Tue Jul 14 07:46:13 2015 UTC,"It's still not a tackle or even a professional foul. A tackle is an attempt to get the ball off someone and he was just trying to put his foot down while running. You're probably right that it should be a foul because he was unnecessarily close, but they still just get their legs tangled.  Maybe the ref didn't call a foul because that would mean giving a undeserved red? Could have still called it and given a yellow and waved off the bitch fits from the Americans though..."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,errordrivenlearning,13,Tue Jul 14 07:58:45 2015 UTC,"In the laws of the game, tripping is a foul."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,MrSantaClause,10,Tue Jul 14 12:38:45 2015 UTC,"Clearly you aren't a US fan if you think the bitch fits are unwarranted.  And also, you clearly don't know much about this sport."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,toddx318,9,Tue Jul 14 13:53:54 2015 UTC,"but they still just get their legs tangled.   If the leg tangling is initiated because one player is running upon another from behind...that is called tripping, and is a foul.  Intentional or not."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,burbod01,7,Tue Jul 14 15:01:43 2015 UTC,Warranted bitch fits. FTFY.
ussoccer,3d7ysm,SteelKeeper,4,Tue Jul 14 08:01:54 2015 UTC,"It was a tangle of feet, which is a foul. It doesn't matter whether it was intentional or not. Otherwise defenders could just run up the back of opponents and ""incidentally"" get their feet tangled. He tripped Bedoya, Bedoya was clear on goal. You're overthinking it."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,sickgrof,20,Tue Jul 14 15:12:15 2015 UTC,"What then am I missing that everyone else is screaming about?   Eyes, apparently."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,DirtD4er,-14,Tue Jul 14 11:56:05 2015 UTC,"I'm entirely with you, I got downvoted in the match thread for saying Bedoya should have just been stronger.  No way will that ever get called."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,MrSantaClause,11,Tue Jul 14 13:36:11 2015 UTC,What the fuck?  Should have been stronger?  Try running at full speed and then I'll clip you from behind and we'll see how well you stay on your feet. Stronger?  Have you ever actually played a match of soccer? Jesus christ use your brain.
ussoccer,3d7ysm,DirtD4er,-14,Tue Jul 14 13:52:29 2015 UTC,Lovely reddiquette you have for someone disagreeing with you.
ussoccer,3d7ysm,MrSantaClause,9,Tue Jul 14 14:21:17 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between disagreeing on opinion and being blatantly wrong, which is the case for you in this situation."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,DirtD4er,-12,Tue Jul 14 14:48:48 2015 UTC,"Nah.  He wasn't clipped so much as just muscled off the ball.  If he'd been stronger their legs never would have had any contact.  I don't care if it's an unpopular opinion, I played CB and I've done that exact thing to plenty of strikers and never got called for it.  Even if you try to define it as a foul - nobody is going to ever call it."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,SteelKeeper,5,Tue Jul 14 14:50:51 2015 UTC,That's blatantly incorrect. Watch the second shot of the trip. Bedoya's left leg makes heavy contact with Cummings right leg. There is no one on earth who could keep their feet after that.
ussoccer,3d7ysm,MrSantaClause,5,Tue Jul 14 15:14:48 2015 UTC,You're a pretty shitty defender then if you let a striker get behind you that often and have to trip them up from behind to stop them. Move along.
ussoccer,3d7ysm,durbin1898,5,Tue Jul 14 15:09:52 2015 UTC,There no sense of stronger here. The Panamanian player throws his knee in to the back of Bedoya's. This is at the very least a free kick. Even at a walking pace contact to that part of your knee will cause it to buckel. At a running pace you will crumble. This is a text book foul and the refs from this group stage have been terrible.  Edit: spelling
ussoccer,3d7ysm,DirtD4er,-4,Tue Jul 14 14:36:58 2015 UTC,This is a text book fowl    No it's not
ussoccer,3d7ysm,durbin1898,3,Tue Jul 14 14:38:29 2015 UTC,"""Direct free kick  A direct free kick is awarded to the opposing team if a player commits any of the following seven offences in a manner considered by the referee to be careless, reckless or using excessive force: • kicks or attempts to kick an opponent • trips or attempts to trip an opponent • jumps at an opponent • charges an opponent • strikes or attempts to strike an opponent • pushes an opponent • tackles an opponent""  This us taken directly  from the fifa rule it is literally  a text book foul. There is no other way around it he was tripped a free kick should have been awarded."
ussoccer,3d7ysm,DirtD4er,-3,Tue Jul 14 15:04:37 2015 UTC,so a foul not a fowl

ussoccer,3dc5yl,Dontmakemechoose2,0,Wed Jul 15 18:45:52 2015 UTC,"This isn't proof.  It's complete speculation.  I'm not standing up for Adu, but come on man.  All this article says is that Adu is listed as the same size now as he was when he was 14, and hasn't improved at all since then....Which is of course completely speculative. By what measure is Mr. Zeigler using to determine if Adu has improved or not?"
ussoccer,3dc5yl,boredinproperty,3,Wed Jul 15 19:20:12 2015 UTC,"It's speculation based on compelling circumstantial evidence. Adu hasn't grown. It's incredibly unlikely, if not bordering on medical impossibility that a 13 year old boy has stopped growing. It's arguable that he hasn't improved (which you're focused on, but isn't even the point that matters). He comes from a country and region that has a history of fudging ages and birth certificates. It's a fairly common suspicion and assumption with most African players, and has been shown to be the case with many other players that were up and coming stars that fizzled out. The only reason why Adu's name isn't forgotten with the rest of them is purely because he played in the US, was seen as the next great hope, and let down so many people's expectations.  Yes, it is speculation, but it's speculation that is widely accepted by many given the plausibility of the circumstances."

ussoccer,3d9twa,Mountainhawk98,9,Tue Jul 14 16:56:30 2015 UTC,"No, he won't get it back automatically.  Using LD as an example, Jurgen has shown that a spot must be earned after a sabbatical.

But last year and this year, with the USMNT and USWNT, something different has been seen. A kind of pride similar to what was around with the 1980 hockey team. A team that unites a nation in support, drawing in people who otherwise would not care into being passionate.  That's why their making it a big deal. Because, for a society where it is cool to be apathetic and negative, the USWNT made people happy and positive and passionate."

ussoccer,3dak3c,Lawsonianwonder,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:38:41 2015 UTC,"Among the third place teams, Panama will face Jamaica in the quarters. El Salvador have already finished their group stage: they have no more games to play; they have 2 points, a -1 goal differential, and 1 goal scored. Guatemala has 1 point and  a -2 goal differential, with 1 goal scored.   Mexico plays Trinidad and Tobago. and Guatermala plays Cuba. There is a slim chance we will play Mexico in the quarter final, and it goes like this; Mexico has a +6 goal difference. They will need to lose to T&T, and Guatermala will have to win against Cuba. But to overcome the 8 goal differential between itself and Mexico, Guatermala will either have to win really big against Cuba, or Mexico will have to lose really bad against T&T. 8-0 Guatermala-Cuba and 0-1 Mexico-T&T is an option. 0-8 Mexico-T&T is another option. 5-0 Guatermala-Cuba and 4-0 T&T-Mexico is an option. Obviously, this is a very unlikely scenario, but anything can happen.  Now, if Cuba wins against Guatermala, we might play them in the quarters.  If Guatermala wins against Cuba but not something outlandish enough to relegate Mexico to third place, then we play them in the quarters.  If Guatermala draws Cuba, then we face El Salvador in the quarter finals.  Assuming we win against Cuba, El Salvador, or Guatermala (Mexico?), we play the winner of Haiti vs Jamaica in the semis. Assuming we win against them, we're in the GC final.  Now, who do we play in the final? In the quarters, the winner of Group C (T&T?Mexico?) will play Panama. Whoever loses between T&T and Mexico(Guatermala?) will play Costa Rica.  So then, the winner of T&T/Mexico and Panama will play the winner of T&T/Mexico and Costa Rica. And we play that winner in the final."

ussoccer,3d6ycl,CsDucK,2,Tue Jul 14 02:29:36 2015 UTC,The whole back line needs to be subbed. Plus Morales and Bradley needs to be saved for future games. How many subs do we have? You think they'd notice if we just put out a whole new 11?

ussoccer,3d6ycl,Springer09,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:24:43 2015 UTC,It's almost funny how scared Beckerman is when he has possession
ussoccer,3d7ynd,ndodpgk16,12,Tue Jul 14 05:34:22 2015 UTC,"My exact thoughts as I watched tonight's match. IMO, the short answer is that he's a contrarian--whether it's directed from producers or his own will.   For example, he lauded Blas Perez for his ""theatrics"" when Alvarado fouled him. I can't think of many former players, or pundits with a heavy influence on the soccer conversation who would say that in today's technological age.   Friedel, Holden, Balboa (in Spanish) blow him out of the water as color commentators and have earned my respect. Alexi is becoming like my crazy uncle at family reunions, crotchety and naggy."
ussoccer,3d7ynd,el_principito,2,Tue Jul 14 08:13:52 2015 UTC,"I'm one of the (apparently rare few) people who actually really likes Alexi, but even I hated when he said that.  No, Alexi, that wasn't a smart play from ""wily and crafty veteran"" -- that was a dive, it was cheating, and it should be condemned."
ussoccer,3d7ynd,Skogrheim,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:26:33 2015 UTC,I'm curious.  What do you find appealing about his commentary?
ussoccer,3d7ynd,bonedoc59,7,Wed Jul 15 00:12:05 2015 UTC,He defended diving and theatrics last night.  He just says shit to get people fired up.  I doubt he even believes his shit.  He also sucks as a color man
ussoccer,3d7ynd,Thpike,3,Tue Jul 14 11:58:46 2015 UTC,"I've noticed this in the last few months... it does bother me so you're not alone. I did find myself thinking... ""Man... EPL is starting soon and those commentators are great."" I feel like Alexi is stuck in a time of american soccer and can't get out of it. When was the last time he played international soccer? 1998? US soccer has come light years ahead of that time."
ussoccer,3d7ynd,wizardofo,2,Tue Jul 14 13:26:17 2015 UTC,"that's another thing that bothers me.  He always references his USMNT days as if things today are similar to then.  Dude, it's been almost 20 years.  Reminds me of Uncle Rico in Napoleon Dynamite."

ussoccer,3d7ynd,rgvtim,5,Tue Jul 14 19:05:49 2015 UTC,"He praised Wondolowski for ""lurking"" on a throw in, without pointing out that Wondo completely fucked up and gave up an ideal change by being incompetent.  He spouts to spout, and is contradictory for the sake of being contradictory.  He makes himself look like an idiot, but people who don't have a refined view of soccer don't care enough to say ""GET THIS IDIOT OFF THE SCREEN."""

ussoccer,3d7ynd,narboots,3,Tue Jul 14 11:20:06 2015 UTC,I think he left ESPN last year and works for Fox.
ussoccer,3d7ynd,OHILIKETHATTT,2,Tue Jul 14 13:46:48 2015 UTC,That would explain everything
ussoccer,3d96zh,hit4cycle,6,Tue Jul 14 14:08:19 2015 UTC,Absolutely. He looked very calm and poised on the ball the few games he played. I have been following him for a while now and he has all the tools to be very successful for us. The only problem is he seems to be injury prone. But he is only 22 so I wouldn't give up on him at all. I see a big future for him coming up
ussoccer,3d96zh,MyFaucetsIsMoenNigga,3,Tue Jul 14 14:42:14 2015 UTC,He was (is?) a member of the Borussia Dortmund reserve team in the third-division of German football and saw some time with the first team. I think he actually started in the Ecuador game before tearing his meniscus
ussoccer,3d96zh,Kap2310,3,Tue Jul 14 14:11:40 2015 UTC,If he returns to where he was before the injury he could very well be a starter at the next world cup. Without the injury I think he would be a regular on the first team bench at least this year with BvB.  He's also been extended a year by the club so that shows some faith in him being able to make it back to that level of play.
ussoccer,3d9wgy,toprecipeslayer,2,Tue Jul 14 17:14:21 2015 UTC,Besler or orozco. Maybe agudelo.

I would probably go with Perry Kitchen, we need depth if Beckerman gets carded.  I'd say our Defense needs someone like Besler to help with the communication and decision making that is failing so badly, but that didn't seem to be a problem with the right 4 guys back there (Evans, Ream, Gonzalez, Johnson).  The truth is, we have everyone we need to win this thing.  I don't know why we look like we are underdogs clawing out victories.  We've been playing like CRAP and we're still in first place and still favorites to win."

ussoccer,3d7x2d,jasonketterer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:31:50 2015 UTC,It's our offense really we can't hold the ball longer than 2min without a turnover. Which is unfortunate because every single time we attack it's dangerous.
ussoccer,3d7x2d,drocdoc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:30:28 2015 UTC,"Generally, teams that rely on the counter attack appear more dangerous than they truly are, like ourselves That's unfortuntely the brand of football we've been playing for quite some time now, minimal possession and counter attacking. Offense has nothing to do with our defense in the grand scheme of things especially in this game since our defense line consisted of some of our worst defenders."
ussoccer,3d7x2d,Sir_Gunner,0,Tue Jul 14 11:05:59 2015 UTC,"Poor decision making.  You have 4 players out there who can be relied on to try and do things they can't do--Chandler, Brooks, Morales, and Alvarado.  Everyone likes a flashy goal, or a little fancy footwork.  What I prefer is a player who only does what he knows he can do right and not **** it up 15 yards from goal.  I cannot imagine what Gonzalez and Ream did to not deserve the start.  They kept a clean sheet against Haiti, which HON and PAN did not, and looked great supporting the team as the pressed up the field and picking out the right pass.  I mean, maybe they were being rested, but wouldn't you think they'd want play time together?"
ussoccer,3d7x2d,3kindsofsalt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:48:24 2015 UTC,"for some reason, i feel that JK has a sick bias towards Brooks and thats why he ""rants and raves"" bout him and starts him, when he's maybe a 3rd or 4th choice on this team"
ussoccer,3d7x2d,AYoungOldMan,2,Tue Jul 14 15:01:55 2015 UTC,JK has to balance between winning now and prepping for the future. Brooks is likely to be a stud and our future back and the only way he can get better is through games
ussoccer,3d7x2d,FrostyGrass,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:11:16 2015 UTC,"Well seeing how Brooks was one of the best defenders in the Bundesliga last season, also performs well for USA, is extremely dangerous on set pieces, has fantastic passing for a center half, it only makes sense that he starts, the issue is that Omar Gonzalez isn't starting next to him he has to constantly cover Alvarado."
ussoccer,3d7x2d,FrostyGrass,0,Wed Jul 15 04:02:46 2015 UTC,"please tell me you are not serious when you say that he was ""one of the best defenders in the Bundesliga last season.""  He was MAYBE mediocre at best, it got so bad that he was relegated to their reserve team. Given the fact they were 15th out of 18, and he was relegated, theres no fair argument you could remotely make in saying he was one of the best.  Boateng, Benatia, Hummels, Naldo, Jantschke, Toprak, Stranzl and Howedes to name a few were all better than him, so please dont claim he was one of the best, he was never close."
ussoccer,3d4qc0,nedjoyce,27,Mon Jul 13 14:42:57 2015 UTC,"I actually find that we aren't ""playing down"" to our opponents,  but we are developing a more technical game, based in movement off the ball, good passing, and skill/style. In the past we were just bigger, stronger, faster: all we needed to push around CONCACAF opponents,  but not good enough to beat the big dogs of the wold.   We have pushed more talent through Europe and back, progressed our domestic league better and gotten those in MLS better quality to play with and against. We have promoted younger stars to the forefront and pushed development along technical lines... this is what everyone wanted.   But the moment the USMNT looks sloppy against teams parking the bus and playing the bully game we get frustrated. This is probably the first time in our recent history where we have to figure out how to use skill to beat brawn and bus parkibg. We will figure it out, and turn back on ""grind it out"" mode when we have to.   I am happy to watch crappy games against parked busses and technically unsound opponents if it means I can watch skilled and technical football against the Giants of the world..   Just my opinion though"
ussoccer,3d4qc0,TheNickMartinez,3,Mon Jul 13 15:14:13 2015 UTC,I agree with this. I also noticed that we are putting a lot more players through the national team.
ussoccer,3d4qc0,Thpike,5,Mon Jul 13 16:25:09 2015 UTC,"Excellent analysis. I think there's a lot of truth to this, Jurgen clearly decided before the last WC that the US couldn't really compete with the top teams, so he'd give youth some experience. I'm not always thrilled with his decisions, but I do believe that he understands what it will take to compete on the big stage and will do his best to try to get us there."

ussoccer,3d3k8e,Twitch703,2,Mon Jul 13 22:21:48 2015 UTC,Yeah but we all get to set along an entire length of the field which is pretty awesome. Most stadiums stick supporters (mostly AO) behind one goal or the other. In this case we're going to have a better view and be the centerpiece of what tv viewers see.
ussoccer,3d2eve,robot-wolf-attack,4,Sun Jul 12 23:52:40 2015 UTC,"The AO section is 129, however in the event of the US not making the final my understanding is that 129 would be the supporter section of another team.  I attended a US-Mexico friendly at the same stadium and AO had the same section. Mexican fans pretty much had the whole opposite side for themselves (I ended up 1 section over from them in the corner). So stick to 128-129-130 to be near US fans as 109-110-111-112 will likely be swamped with opposing fans."

ussoccer,3d2eve,E51838,2,Mon Jul 13 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"Been to the last two finals: it's completely desegregated, unless you get a ticket in the Outlaws section. Rose Bowl in 2011 was Americans and Mexicans side by side (the latter outnumbering us maybe 3 or 4 to 1) and the 2013 finals would have been the same but Mexico lost in he semis, although lots of Mexican-Americans showed up to support the U.S., which was nice.  E: as an aside, your best chance of being in a US-dominated section if it's a U.S. v Mexico final is to buy one of the more expensive tickets. The cool thing about GC games is you can buy club-level seating for decent prices. I went to the QF in Baltimore in 2013 and although the stadium was 80% El Salvador, in club level it was exclusively American."

ussoccer,3d5d2n,jacicconi,4,Mon Jul 13 17:31:18 2015 UTC,"This is cherry picking some crappy stats though... the number of shots doesn't matter, as much as the quality and the shots on target.   When it comes to the Gold Cup alone, the US has faced 34 shots and has only had 13.. that's ridiculous you say.   However the effective percentage is much lower with only 7 of the 34 shots faced being on goal (20.5%). The US in turn put 8 of their 13 shots on goal (61.5%).   Furthermore, if we dug into the average distance from goal of each shot I am sure the stats would show that a majority of shots the US are facing are from way out, with little or no statistical chance of succeeding (if anyone can get me the detailed stats of each game like where shots were taken from etc, i will do the math).  I get that people want to break down the team, bag on Klinnsman, and say we are in trouble, but the facts are this: the USMNT hasn't lost since April (and beat the Netherlands, Germany, and Mexico in that time) and have a GoalDif of +9 (15GF/6GA).   Lastly, I ran the goal tallies for the same time from he mentioned and the US scored 39 goals on those 56 shots (69.6%), while their opponents scored only 32 goals on 131 shots (24.4%)... the real stat/story here should be that our defence is holding teams to only converting on less than 25% of their shots!   But that's just my opinion...  EDIT: I just looked at the shot totals again, and they don't seem to match up to the games played... I font think he factored in international friendlies, so I am going to try and get some clarity their... my percentages in the last para might be off (as the goal tally included IF's)."
ussoccer,3d5d2n,TheNickMartinez,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:32:50 2015 UTC,"He is only including games that could cap tie a player I assume. People seem to love him on /r/MLS for some reason. I get sometimes he's right but he's the same version as armchair quarterback. We also all know he works for MLS, and they don't mind taking hits at JK when they can. Some of the shots for Haiti were laughable but they count as shots (some even went out for throw ins). Stats are so deceiving in soccer, and when you just throw one up that makes the team look bad you aren't really doing your job as an 'analyst'."

The people on /r/MLS love him because he interacts with the community regularly, which is nice, and he has access to sources that no one else on reddit does. But they seem to be stuck in the anti-Jurgen camp with no sign of changing. We could beat Mexico 20-0 in the Gold Cup final and they would still call for him to be fired."
ussoccer,3d5d2n,pdschatz,3,Mon Jul 13 22:06:57 2015 UTC,I don't know if it's MLS pushing it or his own agenda. It's just when he gets beyond the MLS and onto the USMNT he goes into lunacy.   He posted on an article that the 2014 Group that the USMNT was in was weaker than the 2010 edition. Then got upvoted for it.
ussoccer,3d5d2n,skolvikings97,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:30:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I started relooking when i noticed that the Gold Cup already had 34 shots against us. I assume he was only counting competitive matches aka World Cup and Gold Cup.   I have no clue who the guy is, and that's the first I heard of/from him (I don't focus too much on MLS analysis) but that is just bad form.   Like you said there were some really poor shots, sky high ones from like 40+ yards out. The key isn't total shots, but on goal percentage and average distance of shots (closer shots are more likely to be better and go in more). Good teams in the 5 big leagues generally have the best goals/shot ratios, also while averaging in the top of the shots farthest away from goal metric too."
ussoccer,3d5d2n,TheNickMartinez,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:10:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly. I am sure this is something JK talks about in practices and meetings. Granted we've never been in one but that's what I assume.   Most of Honduras and Haiti's shots were really helpless. I like him for his MLS analysis only. When it comes to the men's team it becomes petty. I saw recently where he said the US's group in 2014 was weaker than the one in 2010. I, uh, don't even know where to begin with how wrong that is.

I'm thinking maybe since the US hasn't officially made the finals they can't sell them as GA, but once they make the final AO can try to have the section be changed to GA.   Most games people have bought they knew the US would be playing in so it was no big deal. My understanding is once the US clinched the QF game in Baltimore, AO went to M&T Bank Stadium and requested the section be changed (their Twitter has replies to other people's tweets asking about GA, and they have said they have requested the section be changed.) I'm expecting the same in Philly."

One of those players who, even when playing striker, will happily make the extra pass to get a better shot.

I'd glad to have been proven wrong. He has a great work ethic and does a lot of the offensive dirty work which advances our attack. I wish Zardes well. He'd be great as a super-sub for maybe Johannsson. And I'd like to see him transfer to Europe, maybe Hannover 96, so that he'd be  included alongside Green, Yedlin, Johannsson, Brooks, and Rubin in the European USMNT experience."
ussoccer,3cxkl6,iamMANCAT,5,Sat Jul 11 21:11:42 2015 UTC,"from every game that I've watched recently Zardes has absolutely earned a starting spot. His link up play is probably the best on the team other than maybe Bradley. He plays smart and works hard. Maybe he hasn't earned a permanent starting spot yet, but given his form and the fact that form is a huge factor in a tournament I'd say he should definitely be starting the gold cup games. I'd prefer him over Jozy."

I feel that using Zardes as a super-sub would be  better because his link up play and hustling would work wonder when everyone else is tired and he has fresh legs.  He'd play kind of like how Lukaku was used against us at the world cup,to unlock the defense at a large stage. Maybe a better comparison would be how Jermaine Defoe was used at Spurs."
ussoccer,3cxkl6,synthfreq,4,Sat Jul 11 22:03:22 2015 UTC,"He is miles different from Defoe. Zardes' physical strength, height, top end speed and aerial ability makes him much closer to a #9 than Defoe could ever be.  Defoe was a finisher with decent speed but a cracking shot. He was clever and found space well. You wanna know what player the National team has that reminds me of Defoe? Dempsey."
ussoccer,3cxkl6,iamMANCAT,2,Sat Jul 11 23:02:11 2015 UTC,"Whether or not he is better than jozy is debatable. However, RIGHT NOW he is better without a question. We need to start our best players we have on the roster RIGHT NOW."
ussoccer,3cxkl6,usmnturtles,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:15:21 2015 UTC,"not every good player has to start, I agree. I think yedlin is an excellent super sub. however, I think using Zardes' influence the whole game is best. We can't have our offense look absolutely clueless for 2/3 of the game like it has been. as much as altidore has done for the USMNT he's now the problem in the fact that he can barely place simple passes and makes poor decisions for a supposed veteran."
ussoccer,3cxkl6,iamMANCAT,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:07:11 2015 UTC,"supposed veteran    Just to keep Altidore's recent performances in perspective, he has a hamstring injury."
ussoccer,3cxkl6,usmnturtles,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:02:23 2015 UTC,that's just unto her reason he probably shouldn't be starting then. if Klinsman made his squad selections so that we had the team that would give us the best chance to win then I don't see how a 50-75% healthy Jozy gives us that chance.

ussoccer,3culgt,daddytorgo,8,Sat Jul 11 01:22:16 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or has Altidore completed far more passes to Haiti than to the USMNT? He just walks around when he doesn't have the ball and then when he gets it, he just passes it to the Haitians."

ussoccer,3culgt,Brobi_WanKenobi,2,Sat Jul 11 01:57:00 2015 UTC,Pretty sure you nailed it.

ussoccer,3culgt,ya_machinu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:29:34 2015 UTC,Bradley's too comfortable coming forward. Mix and him should switch. That's how they're playing right now anyway
ussoccer,3culgt,benboggs,2,Sat Jul 11 01:33:23 2015 UTC,and Garza keeps going forward and leaving a gaping hole when we inevitably turn it over
ussoccer,3culgt,ya_machinu,2,Sat Jul 11 01:37:21 2015 UTC,At least Yedlin and Johnson going forward you get their pace
ussoccer,3culgt,benboggs,2,Sat Jul 11 01:42:48 2015 UTC,I think Haiti are getting worn down a little.
ussoccer,3culgt,theslothwhoshaggedme,2,Sat Jul 11 01:20:27 2015 UTC,The team is playing like trash...mix...alti...please go away...cd please step up...defense you are killing me

ussoccer,3culgt,Brobi_WanKenobi,2,Sat Jul 11 01:41:15 2015 UTC,The other day I argued with my brother that Dempsey has no shot at Donovan's record and I swear he heard me
ussoccer,3culgt,LCD_Redditsystem,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:41:49 2015 UTC,Doesnt he need thirteen to tie? Depends if he'll still be playing with us after the gold cup I guess

ussoccer,3culgt,patrice789,2,Sat Jul 11 01:58:18 2015 UTC,Brooks and Omar should be the center defenders...they compliment each other well
ussoccer,3culgt,itsNotDA,2,Sat Jul 11 02:02:16 2015 UTC,If Dempsey had scored again right there I might have shat myself
ussoccer,3culgt,Brobi_WanKenobi,2,Sat Jul 11 02:02:29 2015 UTC,Oh boy ArJo!!
ussoccer,3culgt,daddytorgo,2,Sat Jul 11 02:10:23 2015 UTC,If Zardes is going to develop as a winger he needs to focus on his defense as much as his offense.  He's pretty poor defensively.
ussoccer,3culgt,BigUps55,2,Sat Jul 11 02:16:34 2015 UTC,"That is my biggest fear with the idea of a Shea LB/ Zardes LW combo like we saw against the Netherlands. It would be fantastic speed and attacking ability, but Shea needs help and Zardes just wasn't there."
ussoccer,3culgt,trumpetblast,2,Sat Jul 11 02:28:24 2015 UTC,Why did he dance around with that instead of just clearing it...
ussoccer,3culgt,theslothwhoshaggedme,2,Sat Jul 11 02:26:28 2015 UTC,"Is it just me, or does this new ball seem like it has less air and bounces less than a normal ball?"
ussoccer,3culgt,elank515,3,Sat Jul 11 02:27:08 2015 UTC,It's the surface they're playing on.
ussoccer,3culgt,theslothwhoshaggedme,2,Sat Jul 11 02:27:32 2015 UTC,In the Panama Haiti game they switched out the ball twice because the players were complaining about flatness of the ball.

ussoccer,3cxjjd,Hippo-Crates,3,Sat Jul 11 19:24:07 2015 UTC,Seriously.    I've also noticed that the writer (Leander Schaerlaeckens) never misses a change to take shots at Klinnsman.  E.g. All his stuff on americansoccernow.com  Wouldn't be surprised if there was some history between them.
ussoccer,3cxjjd,HerrMencus,2,Sat Jul 11 21:39:13 2015 UTC,ASN got quite a bit of pushback from users on his 'commentary'. I think they are starting to use him sparingly. He's always been one to make an argument without basing it in facts.
ussoccer,3cxjjd,skolvikings61,3,Sat Jul 11 23:40:29 2015 UTC,"This is a shit article, tl/dr: why is the US not playing well - because of fitness and the opposition's strategy, some of the crappy blogs that get posted on here aren't that lazy. We're not playing well because we can't get the ball in to the opposition's final third and when we do we try to hoof one into the box rather than pass it around to crack the defense. We should really be able to take the game to these teams and assert ourselves and I think that's why there's criticism."
ussoccer,3cxjjd,waging_futility,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:40:23 2015 UTC,Honestly against Haiti I thought we had a terrible first half but bounced back the second half I still have no idea why wondo or Altidore got into this team Where is wood or Morris ???

ussoccer,3cxjjd,Rubentraj,2,Sat Jul 11 20:05:18 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Buying his jersey as soon as he has a senior team number set in stone.
ussoccer,3cxjjd,GenAmbroseBurnside,3,Sun Jul 12 02:01:52 2015 UTC,"Wood just changed clubs and needs to be in preseason with his club to try to earn his way into the Starting XI. JK said this was  specifically the reason he wasn't chosen.   And Morris is injured, had surgery, and is at home recovering."
ussoccer,3cxjjd,DLev45,2,Sat Jul 11 21:38:42 2015 UTC,"Everyone keeps saying this, but I honestly think its just that Klinsmann didn't expect Wood to perform in those two friendlies. The 35-man roster was due 2 days after the Netherland friendly and a week before the Germany friendly, Klinsmann had likely already made his cuts before those two games.  If Wood had made the 35-man roster before Netherlands and Germany, this sub and /r/mls would have shit themselves in anger. The fanbase had nothing but contempt for Bobby Wood before he scored those two winners."
ussoccer,3cxjjd,pdschatz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:03:36 2015 UTC,I think it was always the plan to be honest. Wood got picked for the friendlies because Klinsi wanted to give him a chance to impress so that he would be able to find a new club. The hope was always that he'd manage to parlay good performances into nailing down a new club and that he wouldn't be available for the Gold Cup.
ussoccer,3cxjjd,boredinproperty,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:08:25 2015 UTC,"Against Honduras, we were overwhelmed by heir ultra physical game, and the referee was at fault for not whistling on several hard fouls. Against Haiti, we were vulnerable to their quick counterattacks, and the referee was again partially to blame after disallowing a perfectly legit Aron Johannsson goal.Both were ugly wins, but still wins. I hope that if we win against Panama, it's a beautiful win like our game against Holland."
ussoccer,3ctcuf,TheKevinShow,2,Fri Jul 10 16:46:58 2015 UTC,Was it unfair to expect England to have advanced into the top 3 based on their WWC performance?
ussoccer,3ctcuf,DrWCRupertKBE,5,Sat Jul 11 01:38:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Honestly, they were outplayed by Canada, and were lucky to win that one. Having said that, they surprised my by performing better in the next 2 games. Soccer's funny that way."
ussoccer,3ctcuf,billthomson,2,Sat Jul 11 03:33:02 2015 UTC,I will not dispute that Canada should have won that match but I felt like England rose to the occasion against Japan and Germany. England are better than Canada on neutral soil.

ussoccer,3cvnpn,simpleparadox,5,Sat Jul 11 03:57:45 2015 UTC,"When he's fit and in form, Jozy is a no brainer for the starting 11.   I'd use him off the bench at this point as he's looked slow and poor on the ball through 2 matches.   I wish Jurgen would use Yedlin at right back like you have it but of course he needs to play him out of position."
ussoccer,3cvnpn,sean_heffernan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:51:07 2015 UTC,"I've been wondering why Yedlin has been playing in midfield as opposed to RB. Is it possible he's trying to help him make Tottenham's starting XI or just experimentation? I'm pretty sure that RM/RW position was a weak spot for them.  As for Jozy, I'm thinking part of the issue is that his style of play may not fit what Jurgen is trying to do. There seems to be a greater emphasis on movement on and off the ball and less of a need for a player that can hold the ball and wait for the rest of the team to help attack. I still like him for his size and striking ability."
ussoccer,3cvnpn,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"Jurgen has used attacking fullbacks like Johnson and Yedlin as wingers countless times. I think it because of 1) their speed and crossing ability, and 2) the fact that we don't have any good true wingers. Dempsey is too damn old to start for us as a winger, Bedoya is better as a CAM, Zardes is better as a striker, Zusi honestly shouldn't even be on the Gold Cup roster.  I'd like to see a 4-4-2 narrow diamond or a 3-5-2. Two formations without wingers which allow for quick counterattacks. Yedlin and Johnson should start as attacking fullbacks who have the pitch all to themselves.  Also, I don't like how Reddit (an most US soccer fans) have a knee-jerk ""get jozy outta here"" attitude. He just came off a bad injury. He will eventually find his rhythm with the team and start doing what he does best: hold up the ball and score goals. I feel that Johannsson is the guy we can count on for off-the-ball movement."
ussoccer,3cvnpn,LiamHundley,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:21:10 2015 UTC,"I think Jurgen strictly sees Yedlin as a midfielder and it's pretty frustrating in my opinion. Not that I don't like him as a midfielder, I think he's potentially special at right back. While he may not be the greatest defender (and he will improve) he's definitely not far behind any other right back in the squad defending wise. But he'd be so terrifying bombing down the right side and he has the speed and the stamina to recover and get back to cover his defensive position. I think he's a great fit with Bedoya playing right mid because he's also very capable defensively"
ussoccer,3cvnpn,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:22:20 2015 UTC,"I agree. Jurgen has used hm as a RB before, he just uses him as a winger because we don't have any good wingers."
ussoccer,3cvnpn,MrDerpsicle,6,Sun Jul 12 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"Take a look at what Haiti did tonight. They didn't have much possession, but when they did, they came at us with swift counterattacks. They don't have the best finishers, so they didn't win. Now look at Holland on the other hand. They don't have much possession, but they make as much use of it as possible, and they have developed a reputation as one of the world's best counterattacking sides in football.  I believe that's the direction we should be heading. We need to rethink our roster so that we have room for quick counterattacks.  3-5-2.  CF: Jozy, might not be in the best form, but holds up the ball well, which is integral to the counterattacks. His hold up play was what would have led to Aron's goal if the referee wasn't a moron. He is also a prolific scorer when in form. If he finds his feet at the Gold Cup, he'll score.  SS: Aron. Hi off the ball movement is spectacular. He's always playing on the shoulders of the last defender. He's a speedy forward  who would be vital to our counterattacks  AM: Deuce. Like Bradley, he's not a true AM, but in a different way. When we get on these counterattacks, he's a valuable third attacker with great finishing ability. Still our best goalscorer  CM: Bradley. Two words: American Pirlo  CM: Beckerman. A rough tackling CDM who would be responsible for dismantling attack's in the opposing team's hole between midfield and offence. He would be the guy going up against Dos Santos and/or Ruiz in the knockout stages.  WB: Johnson. Speedy, can cross, can score, can defend, can track back, can take free kicks. A guy who we have to have on the field. He would be the guy orchestrating our breaks. Overall an ideal wingback  WB: Yedlin. Fast. Fucking fast. Can defend. Need I say more?   CB: Ream: I lost count of how many blocks this guy made today on the pitch. I'd like him to be the middle man in our 3 man back line, since he has played in a back three before at Bolton.  CB: Brooks. A younger, faster Vincent Kompany. I feel like he would have taken care of the Haitian attack very well if he had started this game.  CB: Gonzalez. Great for emergency defending.  GK: Guzan. Do I really need to say why?  Subs: Bedoya (Dempsey 60). An Ivan Raktic like workhorse in the #10 position, he is a good passer, is fast, and can cross well.He is to our offense what Kyle Beckerman is to our defense. He's a blue collar attacker.Just don't expect him to score too often.  Morales (Beckerman 60) Would play the role Jermaine Jones played in Brazil. An anywhere and everywhere kind of guy who pops up when the team needs him the most. His box to box role would be even more significant considering he has fesh legs.  Zardes (Johannsson 75) He's a real offensive asset. Bring him on late in the game and watch him light up the place."
ussoccer,3cvnpn,pointlessnostalgic,2,Sat Jul 11 04:25:00 2015 UTC,Really like your analysis of Ream.  People were killing him on twitter but that guy was a stud for most of the game.
ussoccer,3cvnpn,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:34:45 2015 UTC,I like the analysis. What would the back 3 look like? Gonzales or Brooks in the middle?   My only concern with this is that 3 in the back might not be enough bodies defensively. Would you have Beckerman and Bradley sit in front of the defense in more of a 3-2-3-2 or are Yedlin and Johnson dropping back to help wide?
ussoccer,3cvnpn,jiveturkey38,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:39:27 2015 UTC,"Brooks-Ream-Gonzalez is what I'm thinking  I'm guessing that Beckerman and Bradley would deal with the attacks when they are down the center, while Yedlin and Johnson would track back for attacks down the flank.The wingbacks would cover for the center mids, and vice versa."
ussoccer,3cvnpn,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:46:04 2015 UTC,"I'm personally done with Jozy for this gold cup. He's too frustrating. It's not ""out of form"" with him the way I see it. I can forgive the occasional bad touch but last night was more than that. His runs are half hearted, his touch was like an elephant, and he offered nothing going forward. He can be spectacular and then he can be the worst on the team. It's baffling and tiring as a fan. I want to see more zardes and johannson!"
ussoccer,3cvnpn,yarnaldo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:54:51 2015 UTC,"Let's give him one last chance. If his play isn't good against Panama, then he's out for the knockout stage. We have to consider that Jozy 1) just got off an injury 2) brings hold up play to the table which no other striker brings."
ussoccer,3cvnpn,sebadohjr,2,Sat Jul 11 17:13:35 2015 UTC,"Zardes - Johannsson - Deuce       Mix        -     Bradley             Beckerman    Johnson - Brooks/Gonzalez - Yedlin               Guzan   Zardes would play like a winger, tracking back on D, etc, don't want him straying too far from the touchline. Deuce gets the freedom to drop deeper on offense and find space in the middle, tucked behind Aron. I think Aron is smart enough to find the space that Jozy leaves on the right in that situation and pull out wide to keep good spacing.  Mix and Bradley play box to box playmaker roles, drop deep to collect the ball, advance play to the forwards, roles they thrive in. Beckerman plays CDM, which he thrives in.   Johnson is a rock at LB, the team needs that stability, along with contributing intelligently to the attack. Yedlin can also provide width on the right when Deuce pulls inside. CB and GK are self explanatory."
ussoccer,3cvnpn,yarnaldo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:53:47 2015 UTC,"I like the lineup, but with Zardes hugging the touch line wouldn't you limit Johnson's space? Maybe better to have him cut inside when Johnson comes forward, combine with Johansson and Dempsey?"
ussoccer,3cvnpn,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:07:39 2015 UTC,"eh, I don't see Zardes's game translating well to the middle of the crowded field. up top, sure. but if fabian is going to go forward, have him do it in situations where he overlaps zardes, and then zardes sort of hangs back in fabian's spot as a place for him to release the ball back to if he can't get a cross in to maintain possession.  other than that, I would rather use fabian as a defender first, because he is probably the best defender in that back 4, and let him use good judgement on going forward. Zardes and Mix can already provide good width on that side, so you don't need the LB support so much. on the right, Bradley doesn't like going wide, and neither does Deuce, really, which is why you need Yedlin's support more."
ussoccer,3cvnpn,yarnaldo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:23:46 2015 UTC,"The problem is that Johannsson's skillsets would be wasted by deploying him as a lone striker.  Aron is a scrawny Scandinavian dude who gets pushed off the ball way too easily. He's good at off-the-ball movement, finding spaces, taking chances, and poaching goals. Jozy, on the other hand, is a big, buff, physical striker. He's a poor man's Drogba. He holds up the ball, has a powerful shot, can can bully his way through a defense when he is in good form. When he scores, he scores big.  Neither of them are well suited to play as a lone striker, so it make much more sense to play them together, where their abilities would complement each other perfectly, and we'd have a world class striker force. Plus, they're really good friends in real life and have tons of chemistry together from their time at AZ."
ussoccer,3cvnpn,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:37:55 2015 UTC,"Jozy's form is so bad he shouldn't be near the pitch unless we're up 2 goals in the 75th minute.  We are also playing teams that we should be able to play out from the back and maintain possession against, negating the need for a hold up striker. Instead we need a guy who runs in behind the defense well and can control the ball in tight situations, which is Aron's skillset."
ussoccer,3cvnpn,yarnaldo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:18:35 2015 UTC,We need both types of strikers. CONCACAF teams are super physical in nature so it probably would help having someone who can hold up the ball.
ussoccer,3cvnpn,rushjohn11,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:50:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's true, but I think you're missing my point. Jozy is playing so poorly right now, he isn't holding the ball up effectively. His presence up top is negatively impacting the attack, so you can't play him, especially in a tournament."

ussoccer,3cxobo,mitokon,5,Sat Jul 11 18:29:30 2015 UTC,Im pretty sure that the women got a higher percentage of the revenue from their WC then the German men got. This is just a dumb debate.
ussoccer,3cxobo,rushjohn11,2,Sun Jul 12 16:16:01 2015 UTC,"People fail to realize that the actual teams don't get the money, the federation does. The German federation got 35 million to use as they see fit, which included 300k euro pay out to every member on the team (just over $408k) and the rest goes wherever they want to put it- youth development, the GerWNT, staff... literally whatever they want to use it for.  The US Soccer federation received 2 million but are paying the players $300k each (6.9 million), so there isn't really a lot of disparity there. The players agreed to a CBA and are getting paid according to it.   The USMNT made the federation 8 million at the world cup. That, again, will get used wherever the federation wants to use it, including costs for the womens team."
ussoccer,3cxobo,mel11ism,2,Mon Jul 13 15:35:54 2015 UTC,"On a different note-  FIFA is not a commercial business.   It's a massive ""non-profit"" with billions of dollars in reserves (that we know about), it's not an intake-to-payout situation. They just thought they could get away with not paying the women's teams any small amount of respect because they always have gotten away with it in the past.   Make no mistake FIFA not only turned a profit off of the lifetimes of dedication that these players put into their passion for the sport, they also would have had enough money to pay every participant nation a LOT more just from their disclosed reserve funds.   Just to illustrate the FIFA attitude about the women's game: during the Turf Lawsuit in the lead up to the World Cup Canada received offers from sod companies to put grass pitches down for free (as long as they got their name mentioned for it) and FIFA still refused. They just wanted to show that no group of females would be bossing them around - basically being the stubborn ass hats of the century."
ussoccer,3cxobo,kmacstl,5,Thu Jul 16 07:43:38 2015 UTC,"First comment has it right. The women's tournament just doesn't generate the same amount of revenue as the men's tournament does.  Look at the men's beach world cup. The winners of that tournament this year will get a smaller payout than the USA women got. Because the revenue is less. If you've ever budgeted for anything ever, this makes sense to you.  Sounds like more feminist silliness to me..."
ussoccer,3cxobo,TamlandBrick,2,Sat Jul 11 20:57:36 2015 UTC,"I didn't actually start this thread to rehash the same argument on the gofundme page's comments - wondering more what people think about the concept of a fan-sourced reward system for athletes' championships.  When my favorite team wins a title but I didn't get to go to any of the games even though I would have dropped hundreds on a ticket, is it a reasonable thing for me to want to spend some money on them as a reward for winning?"
ussoccer,3cxobo,mel11ism,2,Sun Jul 12 19:08:52 2015 UTC,"I think a better use of funds would be in purchasing WNT specific merch. While setting up a gofundme to support them is nice in theory, it is a drop in the bucket. It is much more important that everyone buys merch or game tickets for WNT matches.   Hell, the best way to go about it, in my opinion, is supporting the NWSL. The league is small and barely surviving. All the players on the WNT play in the league. They need more butts in the seats and more people supporting them. Even if you don't live close to a team, buy a ticket and donate it so the team can give it away for free."
ussoccer,3cxobo,boredinproperty,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:38:54 2015 UTC,This is spot on.  Supporting the women's leagues is crucial.  I wish more of their games were 1pm starts so that I could take my kids (7pm just doesn't work with bedtimes).
ussoccer,3cxobo,boredinproperty,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:42:13 2015 UTC,"If that's the argument you're trying to spur, then I would say no, the entire concept is ridiculous. It's just as silly as the people that tried to raise money to pay Tom Brady's fines in deflategate. I understand that this is a different situation, given how little the athletes here do actually make, but when it comes down to it this is something they chose to do and the idea of trying to tip athletes is just weird."
ussoccer,3cxobo,kmacstl,2,Sun Jul 12 20:31:15 2015 UTC,"This isn't really 'feminist silliness' (if anything it makes mockery of the real issue of pay inequality), I've seen a fairly diverse group of people post it on my facebook. This is being supported by people that don't watch soccer and literally don't comprehend how much bigger the men's sport is on a global scale. They genuinely believe the statistics being put out in certain articles, that the women's match received higher ratings than the men's, because to them the US that is all that matters.

Different nations care about Olympics differing amounts.  If a country has a lot of young players with skill and their program would be able to capitalize on a strong run for the win, they might prioritize it more.  Sometimes your best players are in their upper 20s and the Olympics is a back-burner issue, or a way to give experience to the next generation.  Anything to do with the World Cup trumps all.  The Gold Cup this year, for the US, is a lock for the confederations cup and that is basically a way to keep your squad performing at a WC level the year before the WC.  So the US is going for no less than winning it.  Mexico doesn't want to see that happen, so they are pushing hard as well.  Some nations, like Guatemala, know they aren't going to win the GC and would look terrible at the Confed Cup, so they just see it as a chance to play against bigger teams like USA, MEX, HON, etc.  The 'B-team' thing is a fan-created fiction.  It's not like high school where we have a varsity national team and a jv team.  It is a lot more complicated than ""A-Team, B-Team"", and usually the ""B-Team"" becomes the ""A-Team"" after they win some hardware, everyone forgets how much pre-excusing they did for a potential loss.  I wonder why everyone forgot that when Germany started the WC, they were almost nobody's favorite to win, and people criticized much of their choice of who started.  Well I guess we all forgot that now, and the idea that Brazil were runaway favorites, with Portugal in second and Spain on their heels looks pretty stupid.  The other thing to keep in mind is that clubs often benefit from having players with international caps.  For the biggest teams like Real Madrid and Chelsea, its about building the brand of the team in whatever country they represent.  For teams in big leagues, it's about having players famous players people come to see.  For smaller leagues, like MLS used to be, its about the player having a chance to play against a whole different type of player, and getting experience; which also can turn them into a star and create a fanbase at the club level.  So they can benefit from it.  But they hate to release a good player and watch him ride the bench.  The nitty-gritty is that if it isn't a FIFA sanctioned match, they aren't required to release them.  So if Klinsman calls up Tim Ream from Bolton for another friendly, he's been told that the manager is pissed for taking him away and not playing him.  Also, sometimes they just really need the player bad enough to make him stay.  If it is a FIFA sanctioned game, like a WC qualifier, or a regional tournament, and the national team doesn't bring their best to represent and win, its because they don't want to win.  There is no excuse for bringing a ""B-team"" to a tournament."
ussoccer,3cswme,3kindsofsalt,3,Fri Jul 10 15:04:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation! I do understand that it isn't as clear as A-team, B-team but I just threw that out there out of laziness not wanting to type ""a squad with relatively few players compared to what they would take to the World Cup right now"", though of course as you said the players being brought to something like the World Cup are constantly being changed based on what young talent steps up and performs in these exact circumstances.  I am a bit confused as to exactly what you were saying in your 3rd paragraph. Were you saying that big clubs like Chelsea, etc. like to have star players from other countries with international caps to bring in viewers, or that they like to have players from their own country who compete on the national team? Likewise for MLS, were you saying they like having potential USMNT players play in clubs overseas where they see a different level of play, or that they like having them play in these friendlies to expose them to that level of play? Sorry for my confusion!"
ussoccer,3cswme,3kindsofsalt,5,Fri Jul 10 15:16:28 2015 UTC,"I'm saying that the club's perspective on international friendlies(I.E. whether they will ALLOW the coach to call them up or not) is different for different levels of play.  Sometimes a coach will end up being forced to play a certain squad because he ""couldn't get"" his rockstar players for a friendly because they are finishing up the EPL season, or have an important CL game or something like that.  From the low level of play (NASL, FL1, etc), it is a huge opportunity to have a player transcend to a whole new level of play.  You will, over time, get a player who has developed playing games and training with players from his home country that are at a much higher level league.  This is a big boost for fans.  Miguel Ibarra got a few call ups and Minn U are very proud of him.  That's good for selling tickets and jerseys.  MLS, FLC, NTL, etc see it a little differently, because the level of play is already very high.  This is more of a way of taking advantage of national pride, especially for native players, or just bedazzling your team, ""COME SEE THE STARS PLAY"".  SKC has a roster chock full of nationally capped players from 3-4 different countries, and they don't let anyone forget it.  So its good for the club to let them go and play, but it's sometimes considered very inconvenient.  If everyone SKC had available for callups, got called up for the GC and accepted it, they'd currently be without 6 players of the starting XI.  For teams that are institutions, like perennial EPL teams, the top of the Bundesliga, Real and Barca, Champions League contender teams--these callups are peanuts compared to their normal level of play, they will be the big man on campus when they are called up.  They will often end up playing against their own club teammates, because these clubs buy the best in the world.  It is a bigger deal that Giroud starts for Arsenal than that he starts for Les Bleus.  So they look at this the way any billion dollar organization would, and see it as a chance to build their professional brand in other countries.  So if it means they can grow some lifelong Everton fans in the USA to let Howard play with the national team in warmup games before a tournament, they will do it.  But there are no down-times, and there are no throwaway games for teams at that level.  I hope that helps."

ussoccer,3cswme,RedRavens,2,Fri Jul 10 15:53:26 2015 UTC,"In my view, it gives the coaches the ability to play and evaluate your other players. It also helps build chemistry and play experience for your team. That way, when you do have a starter that goes down, your backup will have experience playing interenationally. Like USA's defense currently, we are playing younger guys due to injury and to build quality depth. It hurts to watch, but is really important for a future standpoint."
ussoccer,3cswme,usmnturtles,2,Fri Jul 10 14:47:14 2015 UTC,"For tournaments, I think it comes down to form, fitness, and any club concerns. You also have weird cap-tying at stake, where players are eligible for more than one country but playing them at a FIFA official event (Gold Cup, WC qualifier, confederations cup, world cup, etc) ties them to one country. Some people think Klinsmann brought Alvarado to the Gold Cup to cap tie him to the US (and I'm sure you have heard the rumors of Klinsmann doing the same for Julian Green at the World Cup).  For friendlies, it usually depends on if the friendly is being played in Europe or Stateside. Klinsmann tries not to uproot too many European based players for friendlies in the US and vice versa"

ussoccer,3cp5az,FHlogin,9,Thu Jul 9 17:25:22 2015 UTC,"Do people here really think Yedlin is a significantly better RB than Chandler? Yedlin makes plenty of bonehead mistakes, and Chandler had been playing great at RB up until this last game. I think he was just outmatched against Najar, who was probably the best player on the field that day. I don't think Yedlin would have fared much better."
ussoccer,3cp5az,klubsanwich,5,Thu Jul 9 20:38:35 2015 UTC,Bingo. Najar is really solid and would be tough for anyone to match up with.
ussoccer,3cp5az,constantlyoff,3,Thu Jul 9 20:54:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Not to mention that putting Yedlin into the midfield allows him more freedom to attack with his speed without completely opening us up defensively. He wasn't perfect but he was all over the field and hustling to make up for errors or win the ball, which he can't/shouldn't do as a RB."
ussoccer,3cp5az,YawningTurtles,5,Thu Jul 9 21:40:30 2015 UTC,Yedlin did a pretty good job of shutting down BPL Player of the Year Eden Hazard in the World Cup. Timmy Chandler once did a mediocre job of shutting down
ussoccer,3cp5az,GoljansBiceps,2,Thu Jul 9 21:51:42 2015 UTC,Yedlin played right mid in the World Cup. Fabian Johnson was the RB during that game.  Edit: I stand corrected
ussoccer,3cp5az,klubsanwich,4,Thu Jul 9 21:54:33 2015 UTC,"Not against Belgium. FJ came off in the 30th or so with an injury. Yedlin took over for him and shut down Hazard for the next 90 minutes. I believe it was Zusi at RM.  I will say though, I think Yedlin is better suited to RM."
ussoccer,3cp5az,GoljansBiceps,2,Thu Jul 9 22:07:52 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, you're right. Most of what I remember about Yedlin in that game was his attacks, so figured he was brought on as a mid."
ussoccer,3cp5az,klubsanwich,2,Thu Jul 9 22:22:31 2015 UTC,"Yedlin's positioning for a RB is not very good, he's not aware of his assignments at times.  He has good recovery speed but a mistake like that can be crucial."

ussoccer,3cp5az,LiamHundley,5,Thu Jul 9 19:19:19 2015 UTC,He was one of the best players on the field against Mexico in April and did pretty well against Guatemala. Any particular times you remember him being subpar?
ussoccer,3cp5az,GoljansBiceps,2,Thu Jul 9 19:58:18 2015 UTC,"He's incredibly strong in the air I'll give him that. But he isn't great at playing the ball out of the back compared to Alvarado and he gets beaten to balls consistently because he lacks pace. With Brooks being so strong in the air, Alvarado is a better pairing with him."
ussoccer,3cp5az,LiamHundley,2,Thu Jul 9 21:39:03 2015 UTC,"His positioning, marking, and general defending is one of the strongest on the team, and I'd much rather have that and suffer him being not as good at playing it out of the back."
ussoccer,3cp5az,DirtD4er,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:26:53 2015 UTC,"He's serviceable playing out of the back. I can't recall any particularly egregious moments for the USMNT. Perhaps with the Galaxy. Brooks is better than both out of the back and controls distribution for the most part anyway. I think OG's biggest problem is losing people on set pieces. Alvarado had some bad fundamentals, but with some experience will probably be better than OG in the near future. But until that time is here, I'd rather have someone with CONCACAF experience."

ussoccer,3cp5az,laddkemtonius,5,Thu Jul 9 19:18:59 2015 UTC,"Beckerman is an absolute warrior and every attacking player on the opposing team knows it. He plays dirty and knows how to get away with it and knows when to absolutely crush someone like he did against Meireles in the Portugal game. He is absolutely the one you want in defensive mid, Bedoya is more attack minded."
ussoccer,3cp5az,waging_futility,2,Fri Jul 10 04:12:28 2015 UTC,"3 years ago when I first started watching soccer, I kept going off about how awful Beckerman was and that it blew my mind that Klinsmann plays him. After learning to keep an eye on movement off the ball, I've discovered that Beckerman is absolutely the 2nd most important player on the field behind Michael Bradley - his vision enables him to prevent attacks from building after a turnover in the midfield, and his seemingly supernatural ability to find himself in the right place at the right time nets us at least one or two interceptions a game. When defending set pieces, it sometimes feels like he's the only one paying attention and checking runners.  After a few years of pointless contempt, I have realized that Kyle Beckerman is, for lack of a better term, clutch."
ussoccer,3cp5az,pdschatz,2,Fri Jul 10 15:07:00 2015 UTC,"Beckerman understands the game as well as anyone the U.S. can put on the field.  His positioning is usually spot on,  his head is always on a swivel and he plays simple.  As a defensive mid he doesn't need to be fast.  He needs to be smart.  Which he is.  Speed is not everything.  There's a pretty famous story about Pirlo not being able to out run his coach."
ussoccer,3cp5az,Dontmakemechoose2,2,Thu Jul 9 23:27:38 2015 UTC,"Chandler struggled with Najar's pace, and Alvarado was too often caught between figuring out whether he should help out or mark striker Anthony Lozano, creating spaces that both players exploited against him.   Key sentence, imo.  Sounds like Chandler is the weak link, and Alvarado (excepting when his ankles got broken) just didn't trust him enough to be able to deal with Najar alone.  if i were Klinnsy, i'd swap out Chandler and see how Alvarado does w/ a better RB. or at least, make sure there's some sort of mechanism to deal with Chandler's defensive liabilities. either the DM drops into the backline to cover for Alvarado, or the backline shifts over and the LM drops a bit deeper, etc."

ussoccer,3cp5az,MrDerpsicle,7,Thu Jul 9 18:12:47 2015 UTC,"We did counter attacking, compact football for years under Bob, it served us well, however, we are onto positive, proactive football.  If we can produce even mild, consistent, results like this we need to continue to push.  That said, I'd like to see us use an array of formations depending on a situation, so I'd be happy to see this tested in a friendly against someone like Brazil, who always seem to eat us alive, but blanket adoption? Nah."
ussoccer,3cp5az,Mekkah,3,Thu Jul 9 19:35:04 2015 UTC,"Scoring two goals off of set pieces while having trouble containing a counter attacking team's offense isn't quite proactive soccer. We did better playing the ball out of the back and that'll be huge for moving into a proactive soccer team, but might not work against a team that isn't focused on defense as much as Honduras is. I agree we need to move into this direction but when we play tougher opponents we turn into the team that stays compact on defense, pushes on counters, and is effective on set pieces."
ussoccer,3cp5az,waging_futility,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:31:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure where you're going with this, but okay, yeah we don't always play proactive, but that's why we keep pushing to do so.  You can't expect to play that way consistently if you abandon that philosophy against the likes of Honduras because the first twenty minutes didn't go your way."
ussoccer,3cp5az,Mekkah,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:31:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think we should work towards playing the attacking soccer and frankly it is disheartening to see it not work against Honduras. It wasn't only the first 20 minutes of the game, Honduras had an effective counter and took advantage of us losing the ball in midfield so much that whole game, they just didn't have anyone in the box to get the ball to so they took 30 yard shots all game until Alvarado's Boateng act. Honduras even had a chance to tie at the end of the game. I want the US to assert itself in the games we should win. I think this is a symptom of not having another player like Bradley who can set the tempo on offense because when he was pressured against Honduras he passed and whoever got it either turned it over or hoofed it long and there needs to be someone else who can calmly move the ball through mid field and it isn't Zardes, Yedlin or Beckerman, maybe take off Yedlin/Zardes for Bedoya as an option.  Anyway, where I'm going with this is that we aren't good enough to play attacking soccer all the time, but I think we should still set an attacking line up and formation and not change, if this is going to be our style we always need to try to play to it. We can always adjust tactics if it works badly, but if it starts working like it did in the Germany friendly at times it is way better to watch and be more American than just relying on counters and set pieces and I think will be more successful in the long run."
ussoccer,3cp5az,waging_futility,3,Fri Jul 10 23:16:41 2015 UTC,"The way the ref was calling the game, if Beckerman had been more aggressive, he'd have gotten a red card suspension, so he was a little light in the tackle.  Our CBs were not winning anything in the air and also making few critical tackles."
ussoccer,3cp5az,3kindsofsalt,16,Thu Jul 9 17:45:23 2015 UTC,What match were you watching? Almost every Honduras cross into our box was being headed/booted out of danger by Brooks or Alvarado.

ussoccer,3cp5az,3kindsofsalt,2,Thu Jul 9 18:38:51 2015 UTC,"The author of the article is right that our defense was shaky, no one can possibly deny that after last night's game.  However one thing that he got wrong is that we won't play a better team than Honduras until the semi finals. Panama is in our group and are equal if not better than Honduras. Luckily we play them last but we really only have a game or so until we will be tested again.

ussoccer,3cp5az,constantlyoff,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:54:14 2015 UTC,"Bit of an overreaction here. The real problem was the midfield not possessing the ball particularly well, leaving the defense in bad spots. Alvarado has played well previously, and is better than Gonzalez."
ussoccer,3cp5az,constantlyoff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:53:23 2015 UTC,"By playing Beckerman, I think Klinsmann gave up the idea of a possession based game against Honduras, and added a little muscle at the expense of technique."
ussoccer,3cp5az,DirtD4er,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:28:15 2015 UTC,"Beckerman can play possession, he isn't/wasn't the issue in my mind, it was the fact that both Zardes and Yedlin don't look to hold the ball and possess so much."
ussoccer,3cp5az,constantlyoff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:43:13 2015 UTC,Beckerman has no touch.  Yedlin and Zardes were both there to stretch the defense and keep them from going compact.
ussoccer,3cp5az,DirtD4er,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:45:40 2015 UTC,"I actually thought the problem in the midfield was that Honduras forced Bradley to give up the ball earlier than he would have liked and then whoever got the pass didn't do a great job of keeping the flow going the way that Michael does. Beckerman needs to be out there though, he's our Mascherano he would tear his anus to make a tackle."
ussoccer,3cocnr,jv-is-nice,41,Thu Jul 9 13:51:07 2015 UTC,"/u/yusuf69 explained it well in this thread (link).  Basically, the rankings are based on a sliding window of the last four years of results. This most recent ranking is from games played July 1st, 2011 - June 30th, 2015. So we lost all points associated with games we played in June 2011 and gained the ones played in June 2015.  As /u/yusuf69 investigated...   Just figured it out I think. look at this Shows the gold cup in 2011 was played in June, so essentially we lost that gold cup and only had these two friendlies to make up for it. So once we wreck face in the gold cup we'll see our climb. Noticed that Mexico and Costa Rica were falling as well made me want to dig a little more."

ussoccer,3cocnr,yusuf69,12,Thu Jul 9 15:05:32 2015 UTC,Ok so the ranking system is the problem. No team today is similar to the team 3 or 4 years ago.
ussoccer,3cocnr,monjoe,15,Thu Jul 9 15:56:00 2015 UTC,the FIFA rankings system is very bad. Check out the ELO ratings for something somewhat better; scroll down below the results to find the US at #14 and close to its highest ELO ever.
ussoccer,3cocnr,llimllib,10,Thu Jul 9 16:32:07 2015 UTC,"Amen. There are ludicrous ratings all over FIFA's list: Belgium at 3, Romania at 8, Wales at 10."
ussoccer,3cocnr,SW1V,2,Thu Jul 9 16:41:10 2015 UTC,"While I like the ELO ratings more than the FIFA ranking system, I wouldn't say either is good or bad, they both provide a ranking with different considerations.  FIFA tends to be more reactive to the current state of the team, so if a team goes on a tear during a non-world cup year, their ranking can improve dramatically.  Alternatively, the ELO rating system is slower to respond to recent results, and it takes more of sustained success to improve one's rating."
ussoccer,3cocnr,seadondo,2,Thu Jul 9 20:19:28 2015 UTC,"you're saying that when the point under discussion is that the US has been doing very well recently, gone down in the FIFA rankings and gone up in the ELO? Seems hard to defend."
ussoccer,3cocnr,llimllib,2,Thu Jul 9 20:28:06 2015 UTC,"Since we're cherry picking teams to base FIFA vs Elo rankings on, Wales recently beat Belgium to go top in a Euro qualifying group that includes some other tough teams (only Andorra is really an easy out for anyone in that group), and are one of Europe's form teams at the moment. I don't think they're the tenth best team in the world, but they're certainly better than 43rd, which is where Elo has them.  I like Elo but I do wish it weighed recent results more heavily. I usually look at both rankings if I want to figure out how good a team is.  And while I'm here, I'm going to nitpick on a pet peeve of mine that I see everywhere. It's not ELO, it's Elo. It's not an acronym, it's the name of the guy who invented the system."
ussoccer,3cocnr,statix37,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:25:20 2015 UTC,"While we have done well recently, it has been in friendlies rather than competitive matches.  UEFA and CONMEBOL teams have been playing in qualifiers (Euros) and Copa America, respectively, so those teams will be getting more out of their games.  Additionally, our 2011 Gold Cup matches were dropped; if we do well in this year's Gold Cup in July, we should some upward movement in the FIFA rankings."

ussoccer,3cocnr,macaronipewpew,2,Thu Jul 9 14:32:10 2015 UTC,"Its just a matter of the window. FIFA rankings reflect 4 years worth of results - in this case, July 2011 through June 2015.

I wrote this article with limited information about USSF's inner legality workings, so please feel free to explain."
ussoccer,3codwl,sawillis,5,Thu Jul 9 19:27:27 2015 UTC,Basically I view this as a pay for play club trying to double dip financially.  These clubs basically extort parents with crazy high fees for the right to play on these travel teams.  My point is that any youth player that comes through that system invests in his own development and I don't think these clubs have the right to essentially bill them twice.
ussoccer,3codwl,sawillis,4,Thu Jul 9 19:33:03 2015 UTC,"I think I understand now. Basically, Crossfire Premiere requires their players to pay their way through the system (kits, travel, etc.) whereas a club like FC Groningen pays for all of the expenses of their youth, thus meaning the clubs that actually invested financially in the players are rewarded an incentive for their production. Is this correct?"

Here's what I added in case you would like to read it:   A possible defense to what initially may seem indefensible is the fact that the Crossfire Premiere can be considered what is known as a “Pay-to-Play” club. In simple terms, all players must pay for their kit, travel, registration fees, and anything else that could arise during their tenure at the club. This is in stark contrast to professional clubs like Santos and FC Groningen, who invest financially in their players, making sure everything is almost 100% paid for. Is it ethical for Crossfire to collect fees from Yedlin’s family during his time there and also to collect an incentive due to his unpredictable future success? It looks like the judicial system of the United States of America may decide that soon."

At a game I watch as much if not more of what is going on away from the ball.  So i might miss a  thing or two the tv viewer sees (over and over in high def replay) but i see things that are not possible to see on tv.  I also get the added value (not always but sometimes the guys in the booth have good information) that i do not get at the game.     I like to watch a replay soon after a live game and I really feel like i got a great picture of the game then.

ussoccer,3cobb0,kooknboo,4,Thu Jul 9 13:39:38 2015 UTC,MLS teams would be bottom feeders in the championship league. It all comes down to salary levels. The MLS simply can't compete when they are paying roughly 1/4 in wages as Championship teams.   (Source: http://screamer.deadspin.com/chart-the-average-player-salaries-in-soccer-leagues-ar-1658856283)
ussoccer,3cobb0,tmoneyttime1,3,Thu Jul 9 17:14:08 2015 UTC,"I'm another in this thread who thinks even the best MLS sides would struggle to hit top six in the Championship. Squad depth is a huge thing - something the American teams are not afforded due to the salary cap. But consider all the players to have made it in America and also played in England, and their respective success:   Bradley Wright-Philips can be fairly prolific in MLS after not quite being able to make it in the Championship. Luke Rodgers had an okay season in MLS and he never made it past League Two. Giles Barnes is doing well at Houston and he never established himself even in a struggling Premiership team. Eddie Johnson had a number of good MLS years and he was the worst striker I saw playing for Fulham in the Premiership. Tim Ream: good for MLS, atrocious for Bolton in the Prem. Brek Shea: not good enough for Stoke   As for NASL - I know someone who played tier-2 American soccer maybe ten years ago and he compared it to Isthmian league level - so that's maybe seven of the English football pyramid. It's probably quite a bit better now but I'd be surprised if a mid-level NASL team could outperform a mid-level League 2 side. Again it's just a resource issue. Your average L2 player gets maybe $100k a year."

Most MLS teams would struggle against championship sides in England and probably be given a run for their money from some league one/two sides.   The MLS as a league in itself is massively underdeveloped. We do have some decent players but the banter of ""lol MLS defending"" has some truth behind it. It really says a lot when players who are more or less retiring from European leagues can come over and be bar none some of the best players in MLS."
ussoccer,3cobb0,ForestEye,3,Thu Jul 9 14:37:38 2015 UTC,Really?  You think a the top du jour MLS team couldn't compete at the bottom of the Premiership?

ussoccer,3cobb0,pdschatz,8,Thu Jul 9 14:51:57 2015 UTC,"If LA and Seattle were tossed into the Premiership at the beginning of next season, they'd both be locks for relegation by December. Look at the CONCACAF Champions League - we can't even compete with Liga MX's best, and those clubs can barely fight for 3rd at the Club World Cup. The Liga MX teams are excited when they reach the Semi-finals of Libertadores, and even COMEBOL's best have only beat UEFA 3 times in the Club World Cup. The MLS is great for a variety of reasons, but  as it stands there's just no way they could compete with even the worst of Premier League teams.   The biggest thing MLS teams lack is depth. The worst player on Middlesborough or Charlton is going to be way way better than the worst player on an The Union or The Rapids, and the way the Premiership or the Championship is structured, those guys probably need to start a game or two just to give others a rest.  And there are some direct comparisons. Take a guy like Bradley Wright Phillips: had an okay-to-forgetful career in the Premier League, had his best season in England in League 1 (13 goals in 17 appearances after coming back from injury), and has been far more productive in the MLS despite being at the tail end of his career (31 goals in 37 appearances).  The MLS is low-championship level at its very best. At it's worst, it's low-League One. The NASL suffers from the same depth problem that the MLS does, which is why none of the NASL teams have gone particularly far in the Open Cup - Top of League 2 at its best, although maybe the Cosmos & Minnesota would be an exception. USL is bottom of League 2 at its best, and anything below USL is barely even professional... I mean, the PDL is basically a summer league for College Players to try and get noticed by MLS and NASL scouts.   But the biggest takeaway is that this isn't something to fret about. I shouldn't even spend this much time and this many words typing this out, it really is a fruitless discussion. The best thing to do is to imagine the entire North / Central American soccer scene as its own thing - our league structures are different, our style is different, out continental competitions are different, and our fan culture is different. We don't have to compare ourselves to England because we don't give a crud. Celebrate CONCACAF soccer for what it is, not what you think it should be based on European standards.   Sorry about your case of beer :/"

Natty Light or, if I'm generous, PBR.  I'm not fretting about much.  We just had a debate about it last night and I thought I'd turn to the Oracle - Reddit.  You hit the nail, though.  It's probably the lack of depth that's going to knock the US teams down a notch or two farther than I envisioned.  I think you're being a bit harsh, but to each his own."
ussoccer,3cobb0,ForestEye,2,Thu Jul 9 15:49:33 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you're talking about a single match, anything can happen. I bet LA or Seattle could nick a result off any team anywhere with a little bit of luck and a full strength squad, but when it comes to a full season there's just no way that any MLS teams stays up in the PL, and I think they'd struggle with The Championship's 46 game gauntlet.  If you're really aiming cheap, I'd go with Narragansett or Genesee, shit's like water!"

ussoccer,3cox9w,MrDerpsicle,2,Thu Jul 9 18:10:07 2015 UTC,Honestly I don't even know who'd be willing to go. That'd basically be a full year of just games with no break
ussoccer,3cox9w,boredinproperty,2,Thu Jul 9 17:52:35 2015 UTC,"It makes sense Germany to have guys come out of retirement for the Olympics, like us they'll have a tournament earlier in the summer, European based players can play one or the other but not both. For us the same is broadly true, whoever goes can't go to Copa America and go to the Olympics, unless they're playing in the MLS, and even then I can't see their clubs being too thrilled. Dempsey, Jones, Bradley, Wondo, Beckerman, and Beasley are definitely possibilities.   While I rate Steffen very highly and think his ceiling is much higher than Hamid's, I think he'll be on the bench for this tournament (or maybe Cropper will be on the bench, who knows). About half the Olympic squads use an over 23 spot for a GK, and especially given some of the talent that could be at this tournament I think that's the right choice. Between Howard, Guzan, and Yarbrough I think that one will start the Copa America and one will start the Olympics, and my ultimate suspicion is that Guzan will be in the net for the Copa America and Howard will captain the Olympic team as a last send off, but I wouldn't be too surprised to see Howard make his send off the Copa America instead, in which case I could definitely see Yarbrough in the net for the Olympics, given how it coincides with the start of the EPL season.  Of the rest I think it really depends. We'd probably all like to see guys like Bradley or Dempsey, but even though they might not get exhausted from it, two tournaments would destroy their club seasons. I think some combination of Jones, Beckerman, Wondo, or Beasley is most likely to fill the last two spots, and I think it will probably be dependent on where the U23s are weakest when the selection is made. Whoever is chosen in the end though will be guys that first and foremost have strong leadership qualities."

ussoccer,3cjn54,3kindsofsalt,5,Wed Jul 8 23:05:13 2015 UTC,Yes. Though FJ is the only player who gets me out of my seat when he starts to run at the defense. He had so many brilliant run from the left.
ussoccer,3cjn54,OMGWTFBBQL0L,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:46:47 2015 UTC,Yedlin and FJ as the outside kids is a fantastic combo
ussoccer,3cjn54,PattyMac811,19,Fri Jul 10 16:10:17 2015 UTC,"Very versatile player, but I do like him playing the back line as opposed to the midfield. He's typically in a great position defensively and is very dangerous when he moves forward with options in front of him. He looked silky smooth moving through the Honduran lines last night. It's a shame Yedlin couldn't finish that chance in the box. Johnson's one of my favorites, quietly consistent."
ussoccer,3cjn54,ya_machinu,5,Wed Jul 8 18:25:40 2015 UTC,"He is solid defensively, when he's actually where he needs to be. On multiple occasions last night, especially on Honduras counters, he had pushed up way too far and didn't bother to get back quickly. It left Beckerman having to slide in at fullback, which is one place he's not so good defensively. However, that is my only complaint from him. He's our best playmaker from the wings and even better when he cuts inside."
ussoccer,3cjn54,spazticpuppy,6,Wed Jul 8 21:55:01 2015 UTC,Zardes had to track back a lot as well.

ussoccer,3cjn54,IKetchBodies,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:36:24 2015 UTC,"Yup, not many wide midfielders that do well on the defensive side like Gyasi.  That's good though because Fab can wreak havoc on the left flank."
ussoccer,3cjn54,Sir_Gunner,5,Thu Jul 9 20:37:53 2015 UTC,"I believe that a 3-5-2 formation with Johnson at LWB would solve the problem. There would be an extra centerback (Cameron?) to cover for him when he gets forward. Plus, there aren't any wingers in front of him, so he has the whole flank to himself. He can send crosses to Dempsey/Bedoya, AJ, and Jozy."
ussoccer,3cjn54,MrDerpsicle,4,Wed Jul 8 22:24:10 2015 UTC,"I think it really would suit us as a country, at least until we are technically improved throughout the team.

ussoccer,3cjvj2,jethrodsp,0,Wed Jul 8 16:58:29 2015 UTC,Bradley isn't a holding mid either. He's a regisa like Andrea Pirlo.

ussoccer,3cjvj2,OHILIKETHATTT,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:21:48 2015 UTC,"I would argue his vision in the attacking third is considerably better than Beckerman's but reasonable minds can differ. To me, Mix is just as good and on the upswing, whereas Beckerman's potential is in the past. Post-WC we need to focus on the guys who are going to both win us games and be a future part of the team. On that note I tire of Jozy having mediocre games when Clint can be paired with a young fun read to work his ass off and who will be more dangerous."

ussoccer,3cjr39,Foxcloud86,13,Wed Jul 8 13:25:54 2015 UTC,would be nice to have Geoff Cameron available...
ussoccer,3cjr39,Brett858,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:05:59 2015 UTC,"He does play that in the EPL, I don't see why not, he is so versatile."
ussoccer,3cjr39,YnotZoidberg15,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:56:47 2015 UTC,"He wouldn't fit into our system as a RB. We need attacking minded fullbacks like Yedlin and Johnson, not converted center backs. Geoff would be Brook's companion at CB."
ussoccer,3cjr39,MrDerpsicle,9,Thu Jul 9 23:53:56 2015 UTC,"I think it was the MLS armchair analyst who pointed out that, despite only completing 50% of his passes on the night (unacceptable), after Chandler came out, the right side was done for attacks on the night. The only time Yedlin got the ball after Chandler's exit was by pinching in, which narrows the approach play and prevents DeAndre from using his speed to beat players.  I'm no longer mad at Chandler, just completely baffled by him."
ussoccer,3cjr39,pdschatz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:57:56 2015 UTC,If bedoya is hurt and yedlin slides back to right back...who plays above him. I like Evans but agree he's totally defensive minded.
ussoccer,3cjr39,MyFaucetsIsMoenNigga,3,Wed Jul 8 14:18:07 2015 UTC,I think you are more likely to see fabain slide over to RB and Garza or Chandler starting on the left.
ussoccer,3cjr39,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:21:17 2015 UTC,Isn't Chandler right footed though?
ussoccer,3cjr39,pdschatz,2,Thu Jul 9 23:55:41 2015 UTC,"Looking forward, you'd have to image that it's Bedoya's spot to lose to Julian Green, but I'm also unsure of pairing Green and Yedlin on the same side since neither is a truly great defender..."
ussoccer,3cjr39,MrDerpsicle,0,Wed Jul 8 14:37:27 2015 UTC,Spurs can develop him into a good RB.
ussoccer,3cjr39,royalewithnocheese,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:56:10 2015 UTC,I as well. Maybe it's an experience thing sometimes I have full faith in that ugly bastard then he does something god awful and detrimental to our entire back line
ussoccer,3cjr39,MyFaucetsIsMoenNigga,4,Wed Jul 8 15:07:33 2015 UTC,"If Klins sees Yedlin as a right winger, I would rather have Bedoya play there than either Chandler or Evans."
ussoccer,3cjr39,OHILIKETHATTT,2,Wed Jul 8 13:33:00 2015 UTC,"Bedoya is just coming off an injury. I think JK thinks it would be dumb to play him against CONCACAFF opponents in the early rounds, coinsidering how rough they play"
ussoccer,3cjr39,usmnturtles,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:37:42 2015 UTC,Agreed. Bedoya gotta stay healthy for a long run in the cup
ussoccer,3cjr39,usmnturtles,2,Wed Jul 8 14:49:53 2015 UTC,Bedoya at right back? I'd rather have Krieger at right back than bedoya...
ussoccer,3cjr39,SubClavianGroove,2,Wed Jul 8 15:08:16 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Garza at LB, and then slide Fabian Johnson to RB. That's where Fabian played in the lead up to and during the World Cup. He looked like our best player during that stretch."
ussoccer,3cjr39,YnotZoidberg15,2,Wed Jul 8 14:12:11 2015 UTC,I could see this happen if absolutely necessary. Garza is still young and has room to improve
ussoccer,3cjr39,martybad,2,Wed Jul 8 15:06:02 2015 UTC,"Those are valid points. Garza looked great in the friendlies last fall. But I'll admit his game has fallen recently. I'm honestly not sure if that's because of inexperience, injury, or both.   I just thought of another potential solution: we call in Beasley for the knock out stage, play him at LB, and the slide Fabian over to RB."
ussoccer,3cjr39,DrWCRupertKBE,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:45:51 2015 UTC,I prefer Garza LB. Johnson LM. Chandler RB Bedoya RM. and then let Zardes sub in for Altidore and Yedlin for Bedoya.
ussoccer,3cjr39,LiamHundley,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:01:29 2015 UTC,"Even though Carter-Vickers doesn't usually play at that position, (RB) I wish we would bring him up and just try it out one time. He has the most composure on the ball I've seen from one of our lads in a long time, especially in the U-20 World Cup"

ussoccer,3cjr39,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:26:50 2015 UTC,I'm hoping he makes the Olympic team not sure if he's cap tied yet
ussoccer,3cjq7s,kick2crash,11,Wed Jul 8 13:17:52 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that he isn't injured. Can't see him starting for the US unless Jozy or Deuce have an injury issue or maybe in the 3rd group stage game if we've already clinched 1st in group. He didn't really have good outings against the Netherlands or Germany (he started both).
ussoccer,3cjq7s,rebenjam,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:34:27 2015 UTC,"If we've clinched 1st in our group in two matches (which is possible if we beat Haiti and the other match is a draw), it could be a very interesting third match. I expect we might see him get a start to give Clint or Jozy a rest, and I wouldn't be super shocked to see Yarbrough in goal to get him cap tied."
ussoccer,3cjq7s,boredinproperty,4,Wed Jul 8 20:09:52 2015 UTC,"Realistically to win the cup I think it's 6 games in less than 3 weeks. We'll see him eventually jk knows what he is doing. Now if he can just get on reddit and look at all the criticism altidore is getting hell maybe pull a Jill Ellis and listen to ""us"""
ussoccer,3cjq7s,OHILIKETHATTT,4,Wed Jul 8 14:52:20 2015 UTC,I guess I just want to see other options other than Jozy. Always been a fan but at the moment he seems uninspired and isn't contributing.   I do have hopes eventually Terrence Boyd can be a hold up forward we need in the future.
ussoccer,3cjq7s,MrDerpsicle,3,Wed Jul 8 14:18:37 2015 UTC,Agudelo can make for a good target man. He's actually bigger than Altidore.
ussoccer,3cjq7s,OHILIKETHATTT,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:37:24 2015 UTC,"Ya I didn't think about that. I would have liked to see him with this squad, he has speed too."
ussoccer,3cjq7s,mulledcider,0,Wed Jul 8 17:05:40 2015 UTC,I'm with you on altidore. He seems to be standoffish and has no intent to do anything but bitch or be lazy. Don't even think Boyd is in our top 7 on the depth chart right now by the way
ussoccer,3cjq7s,Tater_tottenhamV3,2,Wed Jul 8 14:54:06 2015 UTC,"Big fan of Boyd here, but his huge issue right now is he's been injured constantly the last year and a half. However, if he can play a full season, expect to see him jump to the Bundesliga before he turns 26. I've watched some of his Bundesliga2 games before he was injured, and I truly think he's top 3 when he's on his A game. However, he honestly may not get back that form due to injuries."
ussoccer,3cjq7s,OHILIKETHATTT,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:18:14 2015 UTC,Altidore isn't getting the ball because our midfield is playing like trash. He's also being subbed off around 30 minutes before final whistle. Why do people dislike Altidore seriously?
ussoccer,3cjq7s,OHILIKETHATTT,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:21:33 2015 UTC,Because a 32 yr old journeyman for the U.S. team (wondo) has more goals than altidore in about 99% less minutes. Altidore is lazy and a one trick pony

ussoccer,3cjq7s,Tater_tottenhamV3,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:26:58 2015 UTC,I've: he only holds the ball up....that's about it for him
ussoccer,3cjq7s,billthomson,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:29:10 2015 UTC,"Not really. He scores plenty of goals. You have to give him the ball. you mad that Altidore is 10x the striker Aron, Wondo, Agudelo, Boyd and everyone else is? Also, Bedoya a punk ass bitch who has made zero impact for the US in any game he's played."
ussoccer,3cjq7s,tinybubbles1234,4,Thu Jul 9 16:40:14 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you're going to get a chance to see him. I suspect Wondo came in last night due to how physical the game was, I'll be surprised in Johannson doesn't see the field next game."
ussoccer,3cjq7s,constantlyoff,2,Wed Jul 8 20:43:17 2015 UTC,it has been one game.  There are 6 games (if all goes well) to be played over a span of 19 days.   Plenty of players will get some playing time.
ussoccer,3cjq7s,mystrymaster,2,Wed Jul 8 15:00:14 2015 UTC,I can't understand why he didn't come in instead of Wondo.
ussoccer,3cjq7s,constantlyoff,3,Wed Jul 8 15:38:04 2015 UTC,"I liked the addition of Wondo last night - it was a physical game and Wondo can handle that and still give it back.  I want AJ to team up with Dempsey, I think the two of them along with Bradley are the most creative players on the team and I think they could be special up top."
ussoccer,3cjq7s,mystrymaster,3,Wed Jul 8 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"The problem for me was everyone was tired, and Wondo didn't serve as an outlet for pressure or a threat to the Honduras back line. He didn't really hold the ball well either."
ussoccer,3cjq7s,JonVisc,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:11:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with that, I think the idea was great but the end result was average.  He did make a pretty sweet run that Deandre just barely missed him with though."

ussoccer,3chs6l,ImMcthugnasty,3,Wed Jul 8 02:01:44 2015 UTC,That was ugly as all hell -- like 4 clean chances that we couldn't convert at all but then eventually a scuffed header accidentally found it past three guys?

ussoccer,3chs6l,theslothwhoshaggedme,3,Wed Jul 8 02:15:11 2015 UTC,"I see our players getting a bit chippy on the field most notably Brooks, I'm kinda okay with this. Match aggression with aggression just don't let it lead to a poor decision."

ussoccer,3chs6l,Squintz69,3,Wed Jul 8 02:55:23 2015 UTC,Why in the world is wondo coming on?
ussoccer,3chs6l,apaulfy,4,Wed Jul 8 02:55:28 2015 UTC,My thought as well.   Jozy had to come off. He's out of form lately. But why not Johannsson? He hasn't been unleashed in a while.

ussoccer,3chs6l,daddytorgo,3,Wed Jul 8 03:01:28 2015 UTC,What a terrible stab
ussoccer,3chs6l,RedRavens,3,Wed Jul 8 03:03:27 2015 UTC,Nice defense rook. Way to stick your foot out and stab at the ball as it goes by you.
ussoccer,3chs6l,daddytorgo,3,Wed Jul 8 03:05:28 2015 UTC,Honduras has fouled us three times in one drive. How about ONE card ref?! What a piece of trash calling this game.
ussoccer,3chs6l,THIRTY-ONE_to_SEVEN,3,Wed Jul 8 03:12:17 2015 UTC,Get Alvarado off the field! Sub him now!

ussoccer,3chs6l,luckyjarmes,3,Wed Jul 8 03:28:40 2015 UTC,That was not a thing of beauty. I guess they can build on it. Or something. I'll bet Jurgen goes all German on them at the next practice.
ussoccer,3chs6l,billthomson,3,Wed Jul 8 03:29:54 2015 UTC,It wasn't  pretty but it was an exciting game and I'm glad we got the 3 points. Let's hope we can continue to improve.

ussoccer,3chs6l,Kap2310,4,Wed Jul 8 02:16:39 2015 UTC,I'd like to think he's had a fraction of his speed sapped after getting blasted in the legs all half

ussoccer,3chs6l,daddytorgo,2,Wed Jul 8 02:19:23 2015 UTC,He's clearly feeling all the whacks from the Hondurans. Slowing him down a few steps.

ussoccer,3cicqu,The_DSkeeter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"His shot on goal that led to Dempsey's goal was lucky second chance for Altidore; he completely goofed the header. Again, someone his size should be putting the ball on target at least and,if anything, the second shout should've been a pass.  Also, I'm sick of us trying to defend Altidore with his ""hold up play."" As though 1) that somehow a striker's main responsibility, 2) his hold up play style (i.e., mis-handle the ball, back to goal, and do nothing with it) is better than any other decent player's (i.e., turn, face goal and have the defender second guessing your move, and 3) as though he is still the future of the USMNT.  I may sound harsh but it's only because as much as I've defended him in the past, I'm tired of his lack-of-growth his current style of play won't bring us the next level of success."

ussoccer,3cicqu,MyFaucetsIsMoenNigga,-5,Wed Jul 8 03:44:24 2015 UTC,I don't think FJ is very effective as a winger. He simply doesn't have the final ball or accuracy needed for modern wingers. I prefer him as a  fullback or a wingback.

ussoccer,3cicqu,benboggs,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:28:01 2015 UTC,I also prefer Fabian as a fullback but for different reasons.  I think he plays so well when he is able to make runs forward.  He's great at being able to move with pace on the ball and still have the vision to pick out the right passes. I feel like he has more opportunities to do that starting from a deeper position
ussoccer,3cicqu,MyFaucetsIsMoenNigga,2,Wed Jul 8 06:32:23 2015 UTC,I agree. I think we're most effective when our backs make (calculated i.e not all the time) overlapping runs. Most of the Fabian Johnson highlights are of him using his pace to get in behind defenses and causing havoc. Making him lead the charge means someone else is making the overlap and that just doesn't make sense to me.  I feel like I just repeated what you said but hopfully you know what I mean.

ussoccer,3cicqu,The_DSkeeter,3,Wed Jul 8 03:48:25 2015 UTC,"Welcome! Soccer is beautiful and fun, and you saw neither of those last night, but at least it was exciting!  All things considered, the ref did fine. We play in a region known as CONCACAF, which is known for its extremely physical play and consistently shitty refs. But last night, there were equal amounts of no-calls, and each team only got one yellow card. It can be hard to step back and take an honest look at the team you support, but between Beckerman, Brooks, and Deuce there were plenty of retaliatory hard fouls on Honduras that could have been carded.    The ref we saw last night had only officiated 2 other competitive international fixtures, so things could have gotten a lot worse. He let a lot go, but he let it go each way.  The Defense earned themselves about a C+ - they gave Guzan more to do than he should have. Ventura Alvarado (the latino looking dude with all the tattoos) was particularly lost, and Timmy Chandler (the lumber mouthed right back) was his usual gaff prone self.  It'll take awhile for you to be able read the game, so for now just get caught up in all the emotion and excitement!"
ussoccer,3cicqu,pdschatz,2,Wed Jul 8 13:53:17 2015 UTC,"The ref set a horrible precedent by allowing the challenge on Yedlin, which probably could've ended his game, to go uncarded. He then turns around and gives Brooks a yellow for a lesser offense, all-be-it in an advantageous position for Hondurus. With that said it was at half field with a few defenders in position to stop the attack. I do not think it warranted a yellow, especially considering how the physicality of the game was evolving.   I didn't really understand the ref tonight. Hondurus was destroying our players and they didn't see a yellow until 80+ minute. I'm sorry, maybe I'm soft/not privy to Concacaf Reffing, but after a certain point persistent infringement becomes a reality and any tackle, whether it be heinous or  innocuous, must be disciplined."
ussoccer,3cicqu,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Wed Jul 8 16:52:06 2015 UTC,"The ref set a horrible precedent by allowing the challenge on Yedlin   Yeah, he did. Blown calls happen all the time in this sport. But a ref's overall performance shouldn't be determined by one blown call that had very little effect on the match. He whistled Honduras for more fouls than the US, which was an accurate reflection of what happened on the field. He let stuff go both ways, which is par the course for CONCACAF.   He then turns around and gives Brooks a yellow for a lesser offense   It really wasn't a lesser offense. He intentionally hacked down a Honduras player who was at full sprint. The second angle makes it look like he wasn't even looking at the ball when he made the challenge. On a counter attack thats a yellow card 7/10 times. Honestly, the card Honduras received at the end of the game was much softer than Brooks' challenge. The fact that the ref missed the call on Yedlin doesn't change this booking.   I'm sorry, maybe I'm soft/not privy to Concacaf Reffing   Yeah dude, sometimes it sucks to watch, but CONCACAF is a very physical and hard-hitting confederation, and the refs aren't very strict. Watching the Gold Cup, The Hex, or the CCL can be difficult because there is less emphasis on beauty and style and more emphasis on physicality and drive.  And it can be so so so so so much worse. Getting CONCACAF'd is something like this. Having spent the last few year enamored by the MLS and the MNT, I can safely say that this was a pretty even and fair outing from a CONCACAF ref."

Does anyone think they will be on the roster come 2018?  Also, Klinsmann is hell bent on this diamond midfield. Zardes is not a midfielder.

ussoccer,3cicqu,Metaboss84,13,Wed Jul 8 14:01:08 2015 UTC,"I dont understand why at this point, being at a fresh start of a World Cup cycle, that Brad Evans and Chris Wondolowski are still on the roster. Does anyone think they will be on the roster come 2018?   No, nobody thinks this.  But this isn't the start of a World Cup cycle.  This is a Gold Cup.  This is a competitive Cup.  This is the USA's equivalent of the Euros or the Copa America.  Klinsmann has said he wants to win it.  So he brought the best team, simple as that.  He's not here to develop talent right now, he's here to win."
ussoccer,3cicqu,uncleraw,4,Wed Jul 8 04:49:33 2015 UTC,"this, when the tourneys roll around, it's time to stop thinking about the future, and do what you can to win now. Developing talent is for the friendlies."
ussoccer,3cicqu,Binx33,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:27:30 2015 UTC,I disagree. A new World Cup cycle starts immediately after the World Cup.
ussoccer,3cicqu,DavDoubleu,5,Wed Jul 8 14:26:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with almost everything you said, although I thought Brad played relatively well tonight considering the mediocre performances of the starters on the back line tonight.  Thanks goodness for Deuce is all I can say."
ussoccer,3cicqu,uncleraw,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:50:31 2015 UTC,"I think Evans is better than Chandler. We seriously lack in that position. Wish a younger guy was here instead of Wondo.  The formation was missing something tonight. It seemed like everytime we needed a checking run from the midfield, no one was there. And I don't blame that on Bradley or Beckerman. It would be nice to see Mix in there. I don't think Yedlin's game is polished enough yet to be a starter (soon though)."
ussoccer,3cicqu,Evhill,3,Wed Jul 8 03:55:49 2015 UTC,IMO Yedlin is the best RB on the roster. I think what needs to happen is an overall change of formation to get the most of our players.
ussoccer,3cicqu,thehonestabes,3,Wed Jul 8 04:07:48 2015 UTC,"If Zardes can polish up his touch, oh my will he be dangerous"
ussoccer,3cicqu,bigwhiskey91,3,Wed Jul 8 03:37:20 2015 UTC,That was very nervy...
ussoccer,3cicqu,swampy13,3,Wed Jul 8 03:31:33 2015 UTC,"I sat down to take everything in. Zardes played well and made some nice runs. Bradley was working the magic too. That direct he took looked super close to a goal. Subs were okay. Glad to see zusi come in and play well. My only disappointment was the lack of possession. I feel like they lack the ability to even try to break down a defense without a poor touch. Overall, I am glad we got the 3 points and I hope they continue to work at it!  Edit: Autocorrect of Zardes to Sardis... lol"
ussoccer,3cicqu,MrDerpsicle,3,Wed Jul 8 03:48:57 2015 UTC,"Yedlin looks better and better...except for his vision.  He's so keen to get his wheels turning that he really doesn't look around him - that last error to set up that Honduras free kick was atrocious.  He sometimes needs to slow down if there's guys around him.  He had Wondo wide open on the outside when he took that shot in the box.    Zardes is great in the final 3rd, ineffective in the middle, and a defensive liability.  He had some great moves, but he wants to dribble it out from the back line, even with 3 opposing players around him.    Beckerman and Bradley = solid midfield, but not a creative one.  Mix really is a catalyst for us."
ussoccer,3cicqu,swampy13,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:40:18 2015 UTC,On what planet is Bradley not creative?
ussoccer,3cicqu,DavDoubleu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:31:12 2015 UTC,"I meant just for this game.  And he was clearly far more creative than Beckerman (because that's the roles they play).  And obviously his free kicks were great.  What I meant was that in THIS game, I think his creativity was really stifled on the attack because his partner was a defensive midfielder, and the team wasn't really flowing well - people not anticipating the ball, bad first touches, etc.  When he's with Mix, they can both augment each others' creativity, allowing Bradley to setup plays and Mix to finish or complement."
ussoccer,3cicqu,benboggs,4,Wed Jul 8 16:48:23 2015 UTC,Honduras isn't a bad team. I see them advancing and possibly upsetting someone in the 1st knockout round.

ussoccer,3cicqu,bostonboy08,2,Wed Jul 8 03:34:41 2015 UTC,Does anyone have a gif of that shot of ours that almost went in? I was sitting behind the goal and it looked in to me but they didn't show a replay at the game. I m assuming I was wrong or this place would be going apeshit.
ussoccer,3cicqu,benboggs,2,Wed Jul 8 04:48:55 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're talking about Bradley's corner. The broadcast only had two angles, one from quite a ways out, and the other from the back of the net camera. Neither one had a good look at the ball/line. On top of that the announcers said that the Gold Cup does not have goal line technology, so it seems we may never know."
ussoccer,3cicqu,WayneRooneysHairPlug,2,Wed Jul 8 07:47:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it was clearly not in. Their GK was leaning over his line and made contact with the ball while over his line. I don't think it was as close as it looked in real time but I would have to see it again."
ussoccer,3cicqu,benboggs,2,Wed Jul 8 10:05:54 2015 UTC,You might be right. I'm not saying you aren't. The only video i found was on the FOX Soccer recap and its close.   Here is the screencap i grabbed...  http://i.imgur.com/TPaestZ.jpg  Captured the pic from this link with embedded video.

ussoccer,3cicqu,JustDarnGood27_,2,Wed Jul 8 10:06:50 2015 UTC,"My points in no order: Yedlin has to control his touch slightly better, now that he's on wing with Chandler behind him he can't just give a ball away. He got the shit kicked out of them though and didn't bitch I like that about yedlin.  Alvardo gets cap tied and he didn't stand out erronosly until that 85th or 86th minute mixup but the shot sent wide it happens.  As for the subbing...I liked the Evans for Chandler move, and the zusi sub was a stalling tactic so not that much to read into it.  Final note guzan did not impress me at all yeah he made some stops but he looked unsure on when to come out the whole fucking game"
ussoccer,3cicqu,Foxcloud86,2,Wed Jul 8 12:13:02 2015 UTC,Heard commentators (maybe Friedel?) talk about Guzan saying the US holds a high line and Guzan has to start higher. I don't think that's the case at Villa so he might not be used to that and threw him off a litte.   I wouldn't doubt Guzan's ability though he's still a darn good keeper.

ussoccer,3cix2p,fresasandcrema,3,Wed Jul 8 07:07:35 2015 UTC,"I've watched pretty much every game in recent history and to my knowledge if he gets a call up he's on the field.  He's historically been one of our best, most decorated players, not to mention the captain until just now. Played in the PL with Fulham (and a bit with Tottenham) as one of their key players before moving back to Seattle."
ussoccer,3cix2p,ForestEye,3,Wed Jul 8 13:37:32 2015 UTC,"If we win the next one against Hati, I wouldn't be surprised if him, and others, Bradley, Fabain, Yedlin.. ect..  are benched for the Panama game. If we are already on to the knock out games, there is no reason to play those guys against a physical team like Panama. Plus, It would be a good opportunity to give the killer-bee-squad a go."
ussoccer,3cix2p,MyFaucetsIsMoenNigga,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:35:11 2015 UTC,Winning the group is the difference between playing group B winner (likely Costa Rica) and playing 3rd place in Mexico's group in the quarters.

ussoccer,3cix2p,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:08:56 2015 UTC,Not that I know of.  Maybe it is about time that happens?   He had a pretty good game last night but keep your eyes on him in these next two games if he starts.  I will bet you will notice he gets a little slower and runs less and is out of position more often then some other players with younger lungs and legs.
ussoccer,3cix2p,tinybubbles1234,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:03:31 2015 UTC,Ehh idk about that. Dempsey is so reliable - more so than younger strikers like Johannsson or Zardes
ussoccer,3cix2p,tinybubbles1234,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:10:32 2015 UTC,Lets see how reliable he is after two games in a short span.  Lets see if his hustle drops off a bit and ends up out of position more often.  It is not so hard to be in the right place when fresh (he showed that last night) but i need to see it in game 4-5-6 in a tourny to start to be convinced that he is going to be a large factor this team beyond this tourny.   I recently rewatched the world cup game vs belgium just to see if i was mistaken when i felt he was a step behind a lot of that game. I feel he was.  I understand he was a bit out of position because we lost jozy and johanson was hurt also but i still feel like his age is catching up to him.   I know it is unpopular opinion.
ussoccer,3cix2p,Roor12,2,Wed Jul 8 15:35:33 2015 UTC,"Dempsey had to play as a lone striker all World Cup after Jozy went down in game 1. Being up top as a no. 9 isn't Dempsey's best position, he's a shadow striker who can also drop to facilitate play. He's best with another dedicated striker to stay up top and allow him the freedom to run the channels/ drop into the hole and receive the ball"
ussoccer,3cix2p,tinybubbles1234,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:54:28 2015 UTC,"I understand he was not at his best position in the wc and take that into account.    Just watching him for a whole game I feel like he is feeling it at times and it it slows him down enough now and again to catch him just a step or half step out of place.   There is the other side of it,  He has enough skill and experiance to know where to be and pulls it off most of the time.  It will come a time where is either left off the team because he will not take diminshed role or he gracefully learns to ride the pine a lot and be a great sub when needed.  I worry he refuse to accept that he is not up to the task and has to be told to step aside   (landon)"
ussoccer,3cix2p,Roor12,2,Wed Jul 8 16:03:32 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see your points. Dempsey is definitely a frustrating player to watch sometimes. His work rate can be abysmal sometimes, and he very rarely ever tracks back.  Last night he appeared to be hustling though.   I think he will make a great super sub towards the tail end of his USMNT career, but I don't know if it's as close as we may think. Juergen was just quoted before the Gold cup how Dempsey is one of our most important players and how he wants to see him go after LD's goal record.  I wouldn't be surprised to see Clint in our WC squad for 2018."
ussoccer,3cfwyf,MrDerpsicle,5,Tue Jul 7 16:32:00 2015 UTC,Morris gonna be starting soon every game if he keeps up the good work. Altidore will never play in Europe again dude
ussoccer,3cfwyf,OHILIKETHATTT,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:03:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe not the Premier League, but I could see Jozy doing well in France, since Bedoya is constantly in the Ligue 1 all star 11, and since that league is fruitful for big physical strikers. I think that both Bradley and Jozy will do well in Torotno for a season or two, then they will bow to Jurgen's wishes that they play in a better laegue in preparation for the World Cup. I could see Bradley playing in a top 3 Portuguese team, and Josh in a good Ligue 1 team."
ussoccer,3cfwyf,Foxcloud86,3,Tue Jul 7 17:40:43 2015 UTC,"Bradley has started everywhere he went. If he's not psychologically done with Europe perhaps he will go back. Portugal is a downgrade from Italy though...I'm not gonna be convinced of altidore cause his head isn't in it to fight for a spot.   He's got that new disease where he thinks he just deserves  to start where he goes,and quite frankly he's only been successful on two teams."
ussoccer,3cfwyf,Foxcloud86,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:02:49 2015 UTC,"Portugal is a lesser league than Serie A, but 2 of the top 3 teams are all but guaranteed a CL spot.  I don't think Jozy would have to fight that hard for a spot in the starting XI in Ligue 1."
ussoccer,3cfwyf,Taeshan,0,Tue Jul 7 18:43:15 2015 UTC,"True. Considering adu showed just about as much promise maybe even more at a younger age than altidore idk didn't seem benfica wanted him haha.

Green, 25: Bayern  Zelalem,23: Arsenal (youth player for them now)  Bradley,32: probably will head back to Europe at some point but he'll be 32 by then, I could see him coming back to the MLS, maybe NY Red Bulls as a DP  Johnson,32: Barcelona (hey, they were interested in him a couple of months ago, as a Dani Alves replacement, why the fuck not?) After that, he might come to the MLS, maybe for Atlanta United FC.  Yedlin, 26:Spurs  CCV::22, Spurs(youth player for them now)  EPB,23: Juventus (Sporting Kansas City might be selling him to them this summer)  Brooks, 26: Borussia Dortmund or the Premier League.

Jonathan Soriano : 79 appearances for the barcelona b team 55 goals. He got transferred.  To Red Bull Salzburg 104 appearances 91 goals.

ussoccer,3cfwyf,Duffman5755,2,Tue Jul 7 18:21:08 2015 UTC,Which ones?
ussoccer,3cfwyf,Foxcloud86,0,Tue Jul 7 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"Altidore, Green, Zelalem, Bradley, especially Johnson, Brooks. The others are more likely but still impossible to say anything, and there are certainly more likely scenarios."
ussoccer,3cfwyf,Duffman5755,4,Tue Jul 7 18:40:26 2015 UTC,"I mean, Green and Zelalem are both prospects at this point, so it's fair to say that they'll break into their club's first team after a couple of loans, that's what most prospects for elite clubs go through (look at Toni Kroos for example).   Johnson and Brooks are probably both wishful thinking, but Johnson is a key player in a top 3 team in the Bundesliga. Barcelona might be above him, but I could see him starting for say, Spurs, Valencia or Roma in a couple of years. Brooks is one of the top young CBs in the Bundesliga and has a high ceiling. A good Bundesliga team/decent EPL side isn't out of the question for him in 5 years.  The thing about Altidore and Bradley is that they are both top performers for the national team and have had success in Europe before, but now are in the MLS. I could see them kicking ass in Toronto for a little but more time, but I can see them bowing to Jurgen's wishes that they play at a higher level in preparation for the World Cup. Both would likely choose teams where they can start. For Bradley, it might be Everton or a top Portuguese team, for Altidore, it might be a Ligue 1 (big strikers do well there) side like Monaco, Lyon, or Marseille."
ussoccer,3cfwyf,Sir_Gunner,2,Tue Jul 7 18:51:07 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. One other person that I've seen no one make mention of who I think actually has the best chance at playing consistently for a big European side, more than Green, Aron, Jozy, etc is Rubio Rubin. The kid is 18 and has already looked wonderful at Utrecht in the Eredivise. I could see him going to Ajax, having lots of success and then moving on to a large club, maybe in England (his game would do well there)   I actually think he is our best prospect, he looked better than Zelalem in the U-20 world cup."
ussoccer,3cfwyf,Sir_Gunner,3,Tue Jul 7 18:56:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like what I'm seeing from him It blows my mind that a guy my age (18) is starting for an Eredivisie side.

If fan reactions on there bother you that much you should walk away from twitter.  What bothers me now is that the national teams have become mainstream, you have segments of the fanbase that feel that fans dressing up at games in symbols of the US is somehow embarrassing.

ussoccer,3cesie,ooter37,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:06:06 2015 UTC,"It's because the white is exclusive to the women's team. The blue is the away kit for both men and women, so they can't put three stars on the men's version.

ussoccer,3cdpdu,OHILIKETHATTT,3,Tue Jul 7 14:27:18 2015 UTC,"Zardes isn't a true forward, I'll fight to the death on this point. He plays extremely better somewhere behind strikers in the midfield. This is because his first touch isn't always great, and I think his shots are below average. However, his positioning is really outstanding and he can do well to set things up, and be a very effective attacking midfielder. Also, Beckerman better start. A Bradley - Beckerman diamond midfield is our best starting lineup I feel."

ussoccer,3cec1u,rodandanga,2,Tue Jul 7 14:35:15 2015 UTC,"There's no doubt that Title IX has been hugely beneficial to women's sports, but it nearly killed one of the most impressive men's soccer teams.  Florida International won two D2 national championships, and then made the jump to D1 where they made it to another National Championship (they lost).  In 2002 FIU decided they wanted to have a Football team.  As a result the successful men's soccer team was nearly eliminated because of Title IX.  It got to a point where players were going to have their mandatory 1 year transfer waiting period waved.  Fortunately the program was saved at the last minute, but it was close"

Normal is home team wears white, Yes i know they wore blue in the last game here in the USA but it was a freindly so they can pretty much wear what they want.   So if in a fifa tourny the team set as home team for that game wears white what white do the men wear?  do the wear the white the womens team rolled out or do they wear the white they wore at world cup.  I am almost sure the mens team has not worn white in a game since world cup.     I was convinced the uni the ladies wore was also going to be the mens uni since when they released it they had the one nation one team splashed on a lot of the photos but now I am not so sure."
ussoccer,3cd3q1,tinybubbles1234,2,Tue Jul 7 13:04:49 2015 UTC,Well white isn't mandatory in soccer but if the men wear white it will be the polos that we wore last summer. The white/black/neons were women specific. I think we will go with blue most of the time if the other team doesn't have a blue jersey but I'm just guessing

She had some really tough moments against Germany and Japan though. Conceded the PK, the OG, and was the nearest defender on Japan's 1st as well. I'm familiar with both the feeling of being the best player carrying an underperforming team and being the one player having a tough go of it while the rest of the team soars (different sport but still), so I strongly identify with what she's been through.   But taking into account the past two games and especially the final, Lloyd deserves the MVP alone."

ussoccer,3cakmg,Wade_W_Wilson,8,Mon Jul 6 12:01:37 2015 UTC,"Amy Rodriguez offers similar pace but better decision making skills on the ball. Unfortunately, Sydney was already behind Morgan and Wambach on the player sheet. Playing a lone striker in the final two matches didn't do her any favors either. If you're a fan (and she has many) I would follow her matches and support her club (Seattle) and the NSWL as a whole. Hopefully she finds form for next summer's Olympics!"
ussoccer,3cakmg,RickAndMorty_forever,7,Mon Jul 6 14:43:34 2015 UTC,Quick note...Sydney was traded to Western NY Flash earlier this year. But the rest stands... support the NWSL. Every player on the roster is part of an NWSL team and the league could use support!
ussoccer,3cakmg,mel11ism,3,Mon Jul 6 15:55:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recommendation. Is there a reliable stream or channel that televises those NSWL games?   I think Sydney is faster and stronger than Amy Rodriguez but I agree that Amy seems to make better decisions on the ball.

ussoccer,3cakmg,mel11ism,7,Mon Jul 6 13:45:32 2015 UTC,"She put the vets in. We didn't need goals, we were going to win the game and the cup. The sub wasn't a tactical change. It was made because Rampone is the real captain of the team, has been around forever, and deserved to be on the field when the final whistle blew."
ussoccer,3cakmg,3kindsofsalt,-4,Mon Jul 6 15:57:48 2015 UTC,"It was strictly a formality.  You can put in whomever you like.  Klinnsman would have put in some 17 year old he believes in to introduce him.  It's just absurd that a 40 year old who is just going to chuck the honor into her trophy case that's already brimming full was given the honor over what is basically a fairy tale story with Sydney, and she has years ahead of her."
ussoccer,3cakmg,mel11ism,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:59:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It was a formality. Can you really reason that putting in Sydney, who has world cups ahead of her and many more opportunities, is a better option than putting in your captain who is playing in her last world cup and has led the team for so long? We didn't need Leroux or Rampone in. But, Rampone deserved to be on the field when the whistle blew. Is that really absurd to you? Rampone earned the right to be on that field over all the years she has represented the US."
ussoccer,3cakmg,3kindsofsalt,-1,Mon Jul 6 17:07:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't think it meant to her 1/100th of what it would have meant to Sydney.
ussoccer,3cakmg,mel11ism,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:18:57 2015 UTC,"Ypu still havent answered the question... Why Sydney? How about Engen who didn't play at all? Or Harris?  She is the future #1 gk for the US. She has a big future too. Chalupny was out of the NT for years because they wouldnt clear her. She finally got cleared and earns a spot on the world cup team. How about her? Thats a pretty good story too. You don't think it would have meant a lot to any of them?   Rampone is the captain of the team. She deserved to be there when the whistle blew. It's that simple. This is her team, she's the captain. They were showing her respect for all shes done by putting her in."
ussoccer,3cakmg,ooter37,0,Mon Jul 6 17:23:27 2015 UTC,"Because the world cup final is happening in her hometown.  She was sitting on the bench at said final.  The game was blown out and nothing was at stake, and she was left on the bench.  That is ridiculous.  If you can't see why that is a 1 in a billion chance of ever happening to anyone and how messed up it is to deny it to someone in favor of someone who could could build a radio tower with her accolades, I can't help you."
ussoccer,3cakmg,thenatesummers,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:39:34 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I can't reason how it is more important to put a player in who didnt really earn it only because she is playing in her hometown rather than put your captain in who has given the team almost 20 years of play and leadership. I don't think you know much about this team if you dont know how the rest of the team respects and values Rampone. I guarantee you that Leroux would have picked Rampone over herself. Fuck the hometown, it isn't about that. It's about showing respect to Rampone."

ussoccer,3c76dd,Evhill,12,Sun Jul 5 14:45:33 2015 UTC,"As a Crew fan, I follow as much Finley as I can and I think I understand the rationale to leaving him out. His strength, and the reason he is so successful, is his brain. His positioning is good, his runs are good and he is in sync with the rest of the team. He is also quite fast. However, his ability to finish, beat people on the dribble and even his passing (outside his killer crosses) is only ho-hum and maybe slightly better than MLS average.  If Klinsmann thinks that he'd prefer someone who is more independent and whose ability is more based around one's own skill, I can see why they don't want him. Do I think they are right to leave him out? No, but I think they at least have some semblance of a reason."

When Rapinoe presses up and Abby is in the box they create lanes.  An early lead could be critical so it will be interesting to see if Ellis goes for speed/finesse or aggressive power. Whoever she starts I hope the result is a strong offensive front and that our back 4 have one more huge game in them!"

I would have liked to see some experimentation with a 3 back formation, but we all know that the USMNT community freaks out whenever Klinsmann tinkers/changes geometry and personnel."

When you're talking about a system though, this team has shown over the last few years that the 4-4-2 diamond is our best set up.

Our emerging players have different qualities than our strongest players of last year.   EDIT: Altidore though? I just haven't seen him perform well in a USMNT jersey in a while. I would rather see a different kind of striker up there finalizing chances. Also, Altidore seems to do well as a super-sub. Dunno if he just needs to analyze the game before he goes out to try and wreck shop or what, but he seems to be better when used as a sub."
ussoccer,3c4dbf,jeffy93,2,Sat Jul 4 18:31:55 2015 UTC,"It's ok. I play too much FIFA, too. Anyway, this roster is really similar to the World Cup roster. In any case, our strength is in the center of midfield, so if you're trying to get our best players on the field in a system that works for them, I think it's the diamond with Beckerman as the DM, Diskerud and Bedoya on the right and left, and Bradley at the tip of the diamond. Dempsey an Jozy up top and a back line of Fabian, Brooks, Gonzo, and Yedlin."
ussoccer,3c4dbf,usmnturtles,2,Sat Jul 4 18:36:03 2015 UTC,Only problem with this (in FIFA) is Yedlin's low player ranking. Maybe next year's version will pump up his numbers!

But we only used the 3 CB formation for the first half of that game, and haven't used it since then.

ussoccer,3c63m6,Rbk703,4,Sun Jul 5 05:55:02 2015 UTC,"I would guess because it's a tournament and not a friendly. He needs to get in the mix with the national team before getting called up to a tournament. Looking at the roster I would say Robbie would be like 4-5 on the depth chart at LB right now. Fabian, garza, breck, Timmy chandler, the retired Beasley. Would all be ahead of him currently. He would have to get an opportunity to make a name for himself in a friendly like Garza before getting called up to a tournament. Oh and Castillo would probably be ranked ahead of him right now too.

ussoccer,3c63m6,MyFaucetsIsMoenNigga,2,Sun Jul 5 13:20:54 2015 UTC,"He just started playing left back last year, he was an outside midfielder for the majority of his career. During the January camps, Rodgers was having a break out year at LB, and was considered one of the better fullbacks in the MLS. I haven't heard as much about him this season, but then again I haven't watched a lot of MLS. He is a Versatile player, but not nearly as versatile as Fabian, or Bedoya or evens or even yedlin.  Midfield is going to be even harder to crack than LB, you got to look at what exactly he would add to this team, and it's hard to think he can do anything better than anyone we currently have on the squad. That being said, I wouldn't give up hope on him getting invited at least to camp to get a look from JK."
ussoccer,3c63m6,wolfmalfoy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:00:31 2015 UTC,"January camp is still Camp Cupcake, meaning he's still on the very far fringes. When it comes down to it, he just isn't good enough.

ussoccer,3c1nrd,cdragon1983,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:13:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of the points in here.  I will admit I haven't really been following the team closely. I watched in 2012 when they won but only as part of my general olympic watching. I knew her name sorta but Abby, Hope and Alex were much clearer names for me to attach to the team.  The first few games I watched, pre WWC, I did sorta wonder what she was doing on the pitch. Maybe it's the transitional nature of the game right now. Maybe in 3 or 4 years or whenever she retires, we're going to look back and marvel at her as the last of that generation of style of play.   She scares me when she plays and not in the way Tobin or KO or even JJ does. She looks out classed until she doesn't. Then she makes a giant play and her sins from that match are forgiven in the eyes of a lot of fans and commentators.   She is going to win as the best player of the WWC, likely at least, and it amazes me."

ussoccer,3c0oc8,MrDerpsicle,5,Sat Jul 4 00:21:53 2015 UTC,"Some notes from www.ussoccer.com  USA vs. Guatemala:   The United States is 14-4-6 all-time against Guatemala. The MNT is unbeaten in the last 20 games, which is the MNT’s longest streak against any nation and dates back to 1988. Five of the last six games have been wins for the USA. All four of the USA’s losses to Guatemala have been on the road in Guatemala City, and three of the four ties were also away from U.S. soil. In the USA, the MNT’s record against Guatemala is 14-0-1. The USA has outscored the Guatemala 39-17. The teams’ last meeting was also a Gold Cup tune-up ahead of the 2013 edition of the tournament. On July 5, 2013 in San Diego, California, the U.S. rolled to a 6-0 win. Alejandro Bedoya and Chris Wondolowski each contributed a goal. In 2012 the team’s met for a pair CONCACAF World Cup Qualifiers. The first took place in June in Guatemala City, where the two tied 1-1. In that game Fabian Johnson assisted Clint Dempsey for the USA’s goal. Guatemala’s Marco Pappa bent in a stunning free kick in the 83rd minute of the game to level it and secure the only point for the Guatemalans against the U.S. in the last eight years.  Later that year in October, Dempsey would find the net against Guatemala two more times, notching a brace to lead the U.S. to a 3-1 win. Michael Bradley assisted on Dempsey’s second score. Pappa is teammates with Dempsey and Brad Evans at Seattle Sounders FC, while Guatemala defender Elias Enoc Vasquez plays alongside Nick Rimando and Kyle Beckerman at Real Salt Lake. This will be the third matchup between the teams during Jurgen Klinsmann’s tenure as head coach (2-0-1).

ussoccer,3c0oc8,benboggs,2,Fri Jul 3 23:55:53 2015 UTC,Dempsey had let me down a few times. We should be looking to make passes not take on 4 defenders. He's missed open passes to Bradley a few times

ussoccer,3c0vk1,3kindsofsalt,3,Fri Jul 3 19:19:20 2015 UTC,4-4-2 diamond? I can see that..
ussoccer,3c0vk1,benboggs,3,Fri Jul 3 19:29:40 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's pretty much a diamond, but the pedantic ""4-1-3-2"" applies, given that the idea is Beckerman holding and Bradley going all over the friggen place, swapping jobs and overlapping with anyone.  Bedoya and Mix can both deal with that very well, without falling apart or leaving a hole if one of our fullbacks breaks to the attacking third.  I think it's the current paradigm for our team.  The engine room is Bradley, the firefighting squad is Beckerman, and if the CBs aren't high-fiving and 1-2ing forwards in the first half of the first game, we will concede some dirty goals, so that's my point of concern."
ussoccer,3c0vk1,3kindsofsalt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:25:28 2015 UTC,"So my question is, in the ""3"" of the 4-1-3-2, are the wide mids going to be winger types like Zardes, or center mid types like Mix/Morales?"
ussoccer,3c0vk1,MrDerpsicle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:32:16 2015 UTC,"I think they are going to default to playing a ""shuttler"" role just carrying possession through the midfield, but as Bradley goes around being creative, each will need to be able to drop into the #10 role for a bit and offer service and third man runs."

ussoccer,3c0vk1,ohverygood,2,Fri Jul 3 19:36:58 2015 UTC,"This, except Yedlin comes off the bench.  Jurgen has shown more interest in bringing him off the bench.  I say Chandler starts instead."
ussoccer,3c0vk1,toddozie,2,Fri Jul 3 19:54:14 2015 UTC,"I wish it wasn't so.  Chandler is, IMO, a good player that is a consistent liability.  I wish Shea was healthy.  I'm also plenty happy seeing Ream out there wide.  Whoever ends up being our CB duo, I want them to click and stay healthy the whole month."
ussoccer,3c0vk1,3kindsofsalt,3,Fri Jul 3 20:21:38 2015 UTC,"Let's wait until Yedlin gets loaned out to Norwich or wherever and then we'll start him. Chandler might be an inconsistent player, but he at least starts for a decent Bundesliga side."
ussoccer,3c0vk1,MrDerpsicle,3,Fri Jul 3 20:31:07 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if they play for the Sunnyside Elementary Fighting Ducklings, if they are the man for the job and have the stamina, Klinsi's going to start them."
ussoccer,3c0vk1,3kindsofsalt,2,Fri Jul 3 20:54:15 2015 UTC,"But like any manager, Klinsmann prefers 1) players who play at high levels and 2) players who start. I guess you could say that Yedlin fulfills 1 but not 2. MLS guys like Evans fulfill 2 but not 1. Chandler fulfills both. So he starts."
ussoccer,3c0vk1,MrDerpsicle,2,Fri Jul 3 20:58:16 2015 UTC,I think the biggest reason Yedlin comes in off the bench is because him having fresh legs with the speed he possesses absolutely kills tired wingers/fullbacks that have been playing the whole game. I wish he would start him too..

ussoccer,3c2hkz,MrDerpsicle,4,Sat Jul 4 03:44:58 2015 UTC,Timmy Chandler played amazing if only he wasn't a defender. Maybe I am being harsh but it seemed in the first half he was the reason for every Guatemala chance. Always getting caught out of position.
ussoccer,3c2hkz,jasonketterer,2,Sat Jul 4 16:43:00 2015 UTC,"In modern football, fullbacks don't defend that much. They're basically classical wingers who happen to play in a back four."

ussoccer,3c0ubz,high_side,4,Fri Jul 3 22:58:56 2015 UTC,Solo has been directing her ass off when the ball is anywhere in the US half of the field. But that isn't something you notice unless you look for it. It can't be put on a high light reel for people to watch. She has made the saves when needed but not as many as if the defense wasn't as good as they are.  JJ and Becky work so perfectly together. Their styles are really different but they mesh so well. I'm really glad when Christie retires after the WWC she can go out knowing the back line is safe.

But he clearly was a good prospect at 16/17 considering he got a long term contract with a Euro club, something few American teens get.  Unlike many US U17/U20 heroes that turned out to be mediocre, Bobby Wood's body developed fantastically, he's 5'10"" with a solid medium frame and pace to match his good first touch.    To me, Bobby Wood has a good chance as anyone to be a late bloomer, ie someone who's able to continue an upwards trajectory into his mid-late 20's.  And it's perfectly ok to be a late bloomer; just ask Alejandro Bedoya or Diego Costa."
ussoccer,3bwfv7,LiamHundley,2,Fri Jul 3 14:11:40 2015 UTC,"I think the reason many people have been down on him is because he really didn't perform his first couple games on the senior squad.  Just couldn't seem to get the ball into the back of the net despite all the great looks he had, so people started to give him some shit. I really wasn't a big fan of him but he's been in a much better run of form for the squad. He has always been adept at getting into solid scoring positions, but now he's actually finishing them."
ussoccer,3bwfv7,wolfmalfoy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:41:05 2015 UTC,"Drogba is the definition of a late bloomer. He didn't sign his first professional contract until l he was 21,and it was for a third division French team. He went to Marseille when he was 25, and did well there. He still wasn't on anyone's radar until he was a surprise purchase for Chelsea at the age of 26. He still didn't play much for them until he captained Ivory Coast to its first World Cup at the age of 28. That's when he became a regular starter for them. And we know the rest is history."

ussoccer,3bwuu4,FHlogin,2,Fri Jul 3 03:14:44 2015 UTC,"The 4-3-3 was more like a 4-3-2-1, but I think they keep that. The only position I think is up for debate is the flank with Heath/HAO/KO/Press.  A lot of people are wanting KO to start due to her recent performances, but I'm on the fence. I love KO and was saying she should start for a long time, but I think she may be more effective as a sub in this match. Heath is very good on the ball, and Japan wants possession. I think late in the match KO is better to exploit them with her speed. But, then again, you could always start KO and sub in HAO/Press if need be and not lose anything.  I think everyone else secured their positions in this formation."
ussoccer,3bwuu4,ACCBiggz,2,Fri Jul 3 03:00:05 2015 UTC,I get the Heath and KO debate. I don't want to see Press as a midfielder though. She never really impresses me there. She's a solid to really good forward but her as a midfielder isn't a good fit IMO.  HAO just can't catch a break.
ussoccer,3bwuu4,ACCBiggz,2,Fri Jul 3 03:15:19 2015 UTC,"Well, in this formation it is a bit different. She can play more up top than in the 4-4-2. I prefer her up top as well, but formations change the role a bit."

ussoccer,3bwuu4,billthomson,3,Fri Jul 3 01:09:56 2015 UTC,"I could see Wambach starting purely beacuse of the advantage she would have in the air over the Japanese players.

Its her last World Cup and I'm sure she will try her hardest to finagle her way onto the starting lineup so that she can ""lead"" the team to victory.

ussoccer,3brkxd,novalsi,2,Wed Jul 1 21:37:41 2015 UTC,"The small scope of the coverage this season, and the timing of this agreement during a WWC year - coupled with the lack of an agreement beyond this season - makes me question Fox's commitment to continue this beyond 2015. They're just milking the WWC for every penny they can get out of it."
ussoccer,3brkxd,novalsi,2,Thu Jul 2 00:00:35 2015 UTC,"Kinda.  The difference is, the best men in the world play in EPL, La Liga, Serie A, etc.  If it were horse racing, MLS is basically a stud farm.  With the women, though, the best players in the world play (largely) for the NWSL."

The NWSL is a lot better, a lot closer to the product on the field that the men are putting out in this country, than the WNBA, which has to go up against the actual NBA.  I've been to several NWSL games.  I'm not saying I'll watch them on TV, but I think a non-zero amount of people will."

That player went down easy in the box, she wanted contact and when she got it she went down. Tough place to learn that lesson (semi final of World Cup). I hope Julie knows better than to put herself in the spot against Japan/England.  Back to my first point aside from her terrific play all around her one weakness appears to be long balls played over her and corners. She misjudged at least 3 that I counted in dangerous spots."
ussoccer,3bqdk1,FunkyMonkeyBanana,5,Wed Jul 1 12:35:02 2015 UTC,Agreed. It's pretty exciting that she is only 22. I think she needs to work on positioning a bit to cut down on those problems

Against Germany, Wambach again ceded to a new generation of U.S. soccer, allowing players like Morgan Brian, Lauren Holiday, and Tobin Heath to seize their opportunity. Wambach stepping back has also allowed Carli Lloyd to step forward. At 32, the past 180 minutes have allowed Lloyd to take this team and make it hers. She’s done just that; having a hand in all three U.S. goals against China and Germany – scoring two and assisting the other.  The U.S. heads into the World Cup final looking rejuvenated and with a confidence that was absent in the group stage. It’s a team that is charging forward rather than backing in. And more importantly, it’s a team with a future emerging. Leading into this World Cup, you would survey the lineup and call out familiar names like Wambach, Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, and Hope Solo. Names like Julie Johnston, Brian, Heath, or Holiday simply didn’t resonate. This was a team built on veterans, and they would win on their experience.   Holiday has 129 caps, Heath has 97. These aren't new players stepping up, they're experienced veterans. Anybody who actually followed the team prior to the World Cup knew exactly what they were capable of. They've got two gold medals apiece for crying out loud."

Heath was just a player on a really good team, but now she's stepping into a role of being key players for the best (and biggest) team in Women's soccer. She's definitely a part of the new generation, and going to be a large part of it. Maybe that was predictable, but it's just now actually happening.  (It seems like Holiday's been around forever to me and a reliable starter, which this WC hasn't shown. But that's probably my memory playing tricks on me, and she's in the same situation as Heath.)"

While Abby hasn't had a massive role in our wins on the field, I can't help but feel she is doing a ton of work off of it. She seems like a great leader for the team, and she's someone the younger players want to win for. The halftime speech against China shows it the best, just the passion and intensity she brings. She may not do anything on the field all tourney (except a game winner against Nigeria), but I can't help but feel she makes this team way better just by being in Canada with them."

It's an attempt to appeal to those who don't follow the team and only know the big names."
ussoccer,3brbiw,msabinoe,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"BTW, I agree with you that the headline was click bait. The rest of the article I think is spot on, since Abby DID play the big minutes in two of the qualifying round games, before transitioning her role."

ussoccer,3br6r6,DLev45,9,Wed Jul 1 15:40:54 2015 UTC,This is right answer.  I would also bet that if one looked at the avg income of the players on the current us roster at the time these ladies were say 13 they would find that the income levels were above avg.  Competitive soccer is not cheap and takes a lot of time on the parents parts so you will find that only the children of the more well off get a chance to keep playing at higher levels. Those kids then end up in college on a scholarship. I wonder how much talent gets left behind at a young age simply because parents could not afford the fees or the time off work to get the kids to where they need to be to get good coaching.

ussoccer,3br6r6,klubsanwich,5,Wed Jul 1 15:28:55 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it but in order for the us to become a world power in soccer we need the mls to invest heavily in an Academy system. Soccer is a skills game as well as an athletic endeavor and the only way to get better is by creating a system that focuses on skill development not just winning. Our youth coaching also has to get better. There are good coaches, but there are also a whole lot of bad ones that never had proper instruction themselves."
ussoccer,3br6r6,saratogacv60,4,Wed Jul 1 16:25:27 2015 UTC,"Over the past 5-6 years all of the MLS teams have been investing heavily in academies with a lot of incentives from the league to develop and sign ""homegrown"" talent.  At about the same time, USSF underwent huge structural and personnel changes to propagate better coaching, youth development, and a national playing style.  Of course all of things will likely take at least a generation to make a very noticeable difference."
ussoccer,3br6r6,Raqin,2,Wed Jul 1 16:38:48 2015 UTC,"MLS does have a youth academy system, and it's (Edit) sometimes free of charge for any kid to join. Or do you mean more investment in those programs?"
ussoccer,3br6r6,klubsanwich,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:38:58 2015 UTC,"I know they are are investing in their youth Academies. But the best European Academies are not glorified summer programs or after school programs. They are professional residential programs that attract the best youth players from around the world. The mls programs are still expensive and out of reach for many families. Also the European teams pay their players. The kids are pros starting from a young age.

There are good coaches, but there are also a whole lot of bad ones that never had proper instruction themselves.   This! I coached middle school kids. Teams played unorganized. Strategy was obviously never discussed. They practiced drills not soccer. There were no concepts of ""training"". Coaches yelled at kids for being creative on the ball. Their exercises looked like they were from a 1950s physed manual. The same could be said for their ""tactics"".  Some of these kids were amazing players. The vast majority of them wanted to learn about soccer. These coaches just wanted to win games and did nothing for the development of the child which is our first duty or developing the player. Rules have to be instituted so coaches will play kids...that is disgusting."

Each school had their own team and we would compete against each other (until fifth grade when the 3 schools made up 1 team that would compete against other teams). Two of the teams were good (ours being one of them) and the other sucked balls. It wasn't that our kids were just naturally better or more athletic, it was all in the coaching. Their coach didn't allow any improvisation and didn't teach them any skill."
ussoccer,3br6r6,Thin-White-Duke,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:52:36 2015 UTC,"This! You see this culture all the way up to the National team. Our guys are disciplines and fit, but very robotic and not creative. You are right that coaching in the US is largely abysmal. I think that will change over time, but it is going to take a long time. These fossils never get pushed out because there is not the same pressure on soccer coaches as there is on football. No innovation, just robotic repetition and emphasis on winning."
ussoccer,3br6r6,saratogacv60,2,Thu Jul 2 19:25:48 2015 UTC,"Possibly. Though some would argue that the really good players, the ones who have any hope at all of playing at the national or professional level, were discovered long before they were adults, and those elite players are probably already playing as adults. More adult participation probably just means more recreational adult leagues filled with people who will never have any chance of playing high level soccer."
ussoccer,3br6r6,klubsanwich,3,Wed Jul 1 15:43:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're not going to find pro level talent in an adult pickup league, but I think the culture of soccer is important. When I was growing up, the only adult soccer players that I knew were my coaches. Now, as an adult, I can talk to my little cousins about the game and maybe show them a few things that they wouldn't learn from their team practices. That shared, cross-generational enthusiasm could go a long way in creating more high level talent."

ussoccer,3br6r6,Banzai51,6,Wed Jul 1 16:01:42 2015 UTC,"because our women have been playing Soccer since they were kids, and unlike the men who stopped for football, baseball, or basketball our best women athletes continued to play through college and now into the professional ranks.   This isn't rocket science."
ussoccer,3br6r6,TheKevinShow,6,Wed Jul 1 15:26:00 2015 UTC,I disagree. I think this is more taking women's sports seriously rather than anything soccer specific. The US is just way ahead of most of the world in that department.
ussoccer,3br6r6,Froggr,6,Wed Jul 1 17:46:57 2015 UTC,"If the US put as much time and effort into soccer as it did basketball, football and baseball, we'd be a constant contender to win the World Cup. The size of our talent pool would be a huge advantage.  Just imagine Lebron James playing soccer. If he'd stuck with it all his life, his raw athleticism would make him an absolute beast."
ussoccer,3br6r6,TheKevinShow,11,Wed Jul 1 16:52:03 2015 UTC,"God, the ""Lebron would be the best soccer player in the world"" argument again. This is so lazy and probably not even true. A quick player with great agility like John Wall or Chris Johnson with foot skills would make people look absolutely silly on the pitch, I doubt the traits that make Lebron dominant would translate as well to soccer."
ussoccer,3br6r6,pendolare,5,Wed Jul 1 17:08:15 2015 UTC,It's purely hypothetical. His skills developed the way they did because he played basketball. If he had grown up playing soccer his entire life then things would've probably turned out different but it's purely hypothetical so there's no way to know.
ussoccer,3br6r6,TheKevinShow,-1,Wed Jul 1 17:51:05 2015 UTC,"Lebron James is just too tall and he's way, way, way too heavy. Peter Crouch is the only player i can think of that is as tall al lebron and he look nothing like ""raw athleticism"" or ""absolute beast"". Lebron playing soccer would just be a huge waste of talent.  On the other hand, there are probably hundreds of ""wanna be lebron james"" kids how are not going to be tall enough to play in the NBA but they have athleticism and coordination; and they could be amazing soccer players."
ussoccer,3br6r6,bonedoc59,3,Wed Jul 1 22:40:05 2015 UTC,Lebron James is the size he is because he became a basketball player. He wouldn't be that heavy if he became a professional soccer player. Basketball players bulk up.

ussoccer,3bp9gl,battries,33,Wed Jul 1 21:22:47 2015 UTC,"It would be funny if it weren't so sad.    The fact is that LD was not going to be some magical force the US needed to go further.  Leadership was not missing...Howard, Dempsey, Beasley, and even Bradley could bring that to the table.  Donovan continues to come off sounding sad with his passive aggressive whining.  Move on...everybody else did."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,LJGremlin,2,Wed Jul 1 03:09:27 2015 UTC,"Yes exactly.  I never saw Donovan as a real leader.  He's a gifted and talented player, but I can't imagine he was ever the guy Bradley or Dempsey looked up to.  He's too passive and quiet.  He only speaks up when he whines, rather than trying to pick people up.  I really wish he'd transition go the next phase of his life fully."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,swampy13,9,Wed Jul 1 04:39:52 2015 UTC,"I've said this before but I just started watching the USMNT last summer and didn't get to see Landon in his prime. As a result, I really lack any ability to show any deference to this man. Sorry.  With that said, this Tweet actually seems funny and like that was the intention when had posted it. Some of this other comments have pissed me off but this one feel like people are looking for a reason at this point."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,benboggs,8,Wed Jul 1 20:09:54 2015 UTC,"Anyone who is looking at games from a year ago and says ""if only ______, we would have won"" is (forgive me for the American football reference) Monday morning quarterbacking. If we had different players on the roster, so could other teams, and the outcomes would all be different across the board. Klinsmann picked who were the best in his mind to represent us. The outcome was what it was, regardless."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,k_princess,5,Wed Jul 1 05:40:18 2015 UTC,"True, but that doesn't mean we can't say it was a bad call. We might not be able to say ""we would have won with Donovan"", but we can certainly say ""we would have had a better chance of winning with Donovan""."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,ooter37,3,Wed Jul 1 04:45:19 2015 UTC,"You can say it but it does not make it true.  There is one guy who gathers more information than all others and decides.  Coach.  He knows things you and others will never know.  You have to trust him,  He played at a high level.  He has been there done that and I suspect he did what he felt gave the team the best chances."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,tinybubbles1234,5,Wed Jul 1 06:01:10 2015 UTC,"He's a good coach, and I'm glad we have him, but he's not infallible."

ussoccer,3bp9gl,mcafc,0,Wed Jul 1 06:54:42 2015 UTC,"No doubt.  No coach is.  Every single team in every tournament could be dissected and a decision could be criticized.  But there is a difference in what the JK haters bring to the table with their LD love affair.    There are plenty of discussion point regarding the team we sent to the tournament, our tactical decisions, and our performance.  Was there a player we left off that could have been Altidore's replacement?  If so, who would have been bumped off the roster and what which was a bigger concern?  Why didn't we have Beck/Bradley in at the times we didn't  Why did Bradley not have such a strong tournament as expected and was he out of position too much?  And even if he was, does that explain the bad play or is Bradley at fault (hell, is there a reason or somebody to blame at all?)  There are countless other questions we could bring up without attacking the coach on a personal level (and acting like he is clueless) and without bringing up Donovan."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,LJGremlin,0,Wed Jul 1 09:24:23 2015 UTC,"It is far too easy for us, as fans, to sit back and find everything wrong with the situation.  At some point you sit back and have to accept that the choices were made with the best intentions.  We certainly didn't bomb out of that World Cup.  We didn't embarrass ourselves.    The funny thing is the LD fan club is having to move further down the roster to find the person who should have been left off.  LD was just another one of several who, arguably, could have made the team.  Nothing more, nothing less."

ussoccer,3bp9gl,Ralston_Cove,9,Wed Jul 1 02:01:55 2015 UTC,You don't 'get at' something when you're being brutally honest. He's saying something like that in a really snarky way that comes off as complaining and bitter.
ussoccer,3bp9gl,P9J0S6,2,Wed Jul 1 04:18:06 2015 UTC,"I think you all are looking too deep into the comment. I think he was just joking about it, he has made several jokes about it in the past. Or even if not, it really didnt sound like he meant to be passive aggressive about it."

ussoccer,3bp9gl,theobi,4,Wed Jul 1 18:26:23 2015 UTC,"I tweeted something very similar the other day, but just because I am not a veteran player and arguably one of the most prominent faces of US Soccer, I won't catch any flack.  I was never Landon's biggest fan and I don't think he makes the starting lineup a year ago but I thought he should have been on the team for the exact sentiment he shared in this tweet about Wambach.  I get that Klinsmann's decision is water under the bridge but I also don't think Landon tweeted this the with complete intention of bringing up the 2014 WC.  Sure, he wasn't oblivious to the double entendre, but Abby being on the team, even as a substitute, is a great boost to the team.  Stop reading too much into the intent and assuming it was done in a completely malicious fashion.  He is not wrong."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,FollowillFan,2,Wed Jul 1 21:28:08 2015 UTC,"We're not talking about the Wambach part because we don't really give a shit about that part, that's not what's interesting.

ussoccer,3bp9gl,P9J0S6,2,Wed Jul 1 01:52:51 2015 UTC,Donovan fully intended to bring up the 2014 WC. He could have supported Wambach and the USWNT just as well with a differently worded tweet. He's obviously still bitter and he needs to shut up and move on.

ussoccer,3bp9gl,KillrNut,3,Wed Jul 1 03:18:31 2015 UTC,This type of primadonna attitude is why LD was left off the WC roster. It's always about him. Even the Women's world cup is about him. Whatever.
ussoccer,3bp9gl,Trollsauce27,2,Wed Jul 1 05:59:20 2015 UTC,"Landon Donovan is a baby. He's bought into this mess that was thrown around about him being the ""greatest American to play the game"". I'm sorry, but I don't think so. Howard and Dempsey are easily better, in my opinion. Landon stayed within his comfort zone, and ate up the praise, and I have no problem with that. My problem comes with him believing he would've been the savior of the World Cup. I agreed with Klinsmann when he left Lando off the roster then, and I agree with that decision now. If Landon cared about his legacy he'd keep his mouth shut."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,sadfatlonely,-2,Wed Jul 1 18:20:15 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that Dempsey's a better player. And if we're adding goalkeepers into the conversation, I don't know that Donovan makes the top 4 or 5.  I don't think that him being bitter has to detract from him being a really good player."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,kentuckyfriedawesome,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:41:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a dig. I mean, if it's passive aggressive, then why make the dig?  He wasn't very enthusiastic or present, esp during World Cup Qualifiers."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,bunkcephus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:06:42 2015 UTC,"The analogy falls apart because at this point Wambach is less a top player than a corpse being propped up ""Weekend at Bernie's"" style, the decline in her productivity has been so precipitous. And instead of providing ""veteran leadership"" she mostly complains about the artificial turf to meet the contractual obligations of her Scotts sponsorship, and even publicly criticizes her own teammates.  Meanwhile in the year leading up to the World Cup, Donovan led all US players in goals + assists, and chances created by a mile. He then went on to have more chances created in the 2014 MLS season than any player since Opta began keeping track, and more assists than any player since Valderrama last century."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,xbhaskarx,-1,Wed Jul 1 13:08:58 2015 UTC,I liked him better when he was on a leave of absence.
ussoccer,3bp9gl,drainstolake,-4,Wed Jul 1 17:15:30 2015 UTC,"These comments represent some bullshit American stoism and you know what? That's what is lame. ""Grow up Landon"" ""Get over it Landon"" ""Landon you're making yourself look bad""  Are you people serious?!  The all time greatest player for our national team was left off the roster for a baby named Julian Green who can't even make an 18 and Landon's unquenched anger is the joke?  How about the slap in the face to our program that JK made by leaving him off.  Some serious JK brown nosers here.   I'm not even a LD fanboy, but he got fucked over.  Also, whoever referenced Alexi Lalas, one of the most arrogant pricks I've been force fed by U.S. Soccer media, I. Can't. Even."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,FunkyMonkeyBanana,13,Wed Jul 1 21:04:29 2015 UTC,"Using Green as an example is an awful choice.  Given that he scored and put us back in the contest.  At least use Wondo as he fluffed a cherry picked goal which had LD's signature written all over it.  Only would have been more fitting if Wondo missed a PK.  There was no slap in the face to any program by leaving Donovan off the squad.  Donovan was openly discussing his struggles with keeping up and that his body was breaking down.  You have to believe that JK hears that and thinks ""I was scoring goals in a World Cup at an older age than this kid is breaking down.""    LD does need to move on.  He does need to get over it.  What is done is done.  We advanced from the group of death (which some people say wasn't the GoD because we advanced...how is that for a lose-lose) and took Belgium to the wire.    The biggest criticism JK should take for the roster selection is not having a clear backup for Jozy.  LD was NOT going to fill that role.      Landon was great for the US.  For several World Cups.  His time is over.  It was over last Spring.  He needs to deal with it.  Before he becomes Uncle Rico."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,LJGremlin,5,Wed Jul 1 01:59:45 2015 UTC,Yea yea...but it was over a year ago.
ussoccer,3bp9gl,Brick__Wall,2,Wed Jul 1 02:36:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but IT WAS A FUCKING YEAR AGO.  Get over it. What's done is done. There's no way to know what effect Donovan would have had if he'd been included. Past performance doesn't guarantee anything. He could have played and been completely invisible.  He's just being a sore loser over something that can't be changed. It's sour grapes. Nothing more."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,TheKevinShow,-5,Wed Jul 1 04:46:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think this fan base rubbing out the wrong that occurred is a sign they can't deal with the fact the current coach messed up huge and want to support him going forward. JK made a huge mistake. Donovan was still deadly. Always will be. He wasn't over the hill. He simply had legs that were wearing down, yet still was one of the fittest players on the squad, with one of our best work rates, best vision on the ball (he used to be the go to goal scorer, but adapted the game to his ""slowing down"" and became a passer). Saying LD couldn't play as well because he made a comment that his body is slowing down is bullshit. He was speaking a truth that every human after 28 that plays soccer understands."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,FunkyMonkeyBanana,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:26:31 2015 UTC,"Julian Green scored a World Cup goal with his first touch of the ball. If you're going to say Lando should have taken anyone's spot on the roster, at least name someone like Brad Davis or Wondo.   In the end, the team exceeded expectations despite not calling up Landon. Thinking someone deserves a spot on the World Cup roster out of tenure or old times sake or sentimentality is how Spain got eliminated in the group stage.   By the way, Landon's not even the best American player of his generation."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,philwelch,0,Wed Jul 1 05:02:06 2015 UTC,"Including one player based upon experience, current skill set, and need in the player selection isn't being Spain. Building your entire team around a past tournament when you have younger players that are CLEARLY above and beyond the older ones. That is a mistake. Donovan hadn't been passed by Mix or Green or Wondo.  JK didn't like him and that was it. Any other story told at this point is a lie and the fanbase is trying to rewrite the script to cover it up on behalf of JK. If Donovan can't talk about this a year later because it's old news then why is everyone so fired up about it including myself?  Cuz it's not old news, yet. We still haven't played a major tournament since then and we're watching performances of players selected ahead of Donovan and he could be outperforming them even still if he mentally chose to.  He gets up for WC's. Every player does. Fuck, the citizens of the USA do and we aren't even a ""soccer nation""."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,FunkyMonkeyBanana,0,Wed Jul 1 05:08:42 2015 UTC,Who's the best outfield player of his generation?
ussoccer,3bp9gl,waging_futility,-4,Wed Jul 1 05:26:11 2015 UTC,Dempsey.
ussoccer,3bp9gl,philwelch,2,Wed Jul 1 10:54:15 2015 UTC,"Dempsey had the best ingenuity, but all around? It's Donovan. Dempsey never could get past his bi polar state of play and lack of defensive effort. Donovan contributed corner to corner on the field and other teams were weary of him everywhere. Dempsey just around the 18."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,FunkyMonkeyBanana,0,Wed Jul 1 03:47:22 2015 UTC,"It was possible to build a mid-table Premier League team around Dempsey in his prime. I know because I watched Fulham do it. We'll never know if that was true of Donovan. It's true that they played different roles, but Dempsey played his role on a higher level. Maybe Donovan could have stepped up to the same level if he ever made a permanent move to Everton, but despite a couple promising loans, he never did. Donovan had the potential to be the best American player of all time, but he never did what it took to make that happen and ended up being surpassed by others who did put in the hard work of developing at a higher level."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,philwelch,2,Wed Jul 1 10:59:44 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good point. It's hard to say for sure in regards to Donovan in that he never took a contract overseas on more than a loan. That's fair.  I think you have a little bias towards Dempsey as a Fulham fan because iirc he only had that one break out year and otherwise was an average at best attacking midfielder/supporting forward (in the EPL, I acknowledge) that played in such a way it took very specific pieces to get him firing on all cylinders without sacrificing the team's game.  Donovan has an equally effective loan stint with Everton that completely lit that team and fan base on fire. He's still loved there, probably as much as Deuce.  I like both players equally and I feel both are quirky in their own rights. Dempsey in his playing style, Donovan in his mentality. Imagine if you had Dempsey's drive with Donovan's playing style?! Or Dempsey's on ball skills with Donovan's ability to interplay with teammates?! Ahh one can dream...  Instead lets just grab players raised in Europe, throw an American flag tattoo on them and pretend like it's all the same haha, but I digress."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,FunkyMonkeyBanana,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:05:00 2015 UTC,"Dempsey can build good partnerships (he did so with Pogrebnyak and Martins) but Donovan definitely had his strengths as well, just as Dempsey has his weaknesses."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,philwelch,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:09:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with Pogremnyak, I'll have to watch some highlights.  As for the latter, I don't think a partnership in MLS comprised of two players more or less playing in a lesser competition should count.  They definitely have a connection, but it's not against EPL defenders and midfielders.  Gerard, , Martins, Kaka, Dempsey, Beckham, Pirlo, etc. are immediately the best players on the field. It's like putting a Varsity kid on the field with JV players."
ussoccer,3bp9gl,FunkyMonkeyBanana,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:02:11 2015 UTC,You can have two great players without having anywhere near the chemistry Dempsey and Martins have.   Pogrebnyak is a striker who had a very good year at Fulham with Dempsey.

This he was the all time greatest player for our team so he should have been on the roster is BS..........Using that logic him and dempsey will still be on the roster in 2022 and 2026?  Klose and Jurgen will still be on German roster and holy cow that Brazil team will be unbeatable. You do not win or get on a roster based on past performance.  You win or get that roster spot based with what you got right now.  I will say that now and again spots on a roster might lean towards what you can a player do for us in the future and is having them on now really going to hurt the teams results.

ussoccer,3bp70v,blazing_ent,23,Wed Jul 1 11:21:31 2015 UTC,"To be fair to Germany, I think the only reason they were playing scared is because our defense was a little too reminiscent of the Berlin Wall. Too tasteless?"
ussoccer,3bp70v,billthomson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:18:23 2015 UTC,Too soon!!!
ussoccer,3bp70v,benyar,12,Wed Jul 1 02:35:17 2015 UTC,"I put this comment in the other thread, but will repeat it here:  Watching on Canadian TV, two things that kept being repeated: Johnston should have been shown a red, and the penalty called on Krahn was outside the box. Was driving me crazy, yes you can make a case for both, but the US clearly should have been given a penalty in the 1st half, and honestly what I saw out there was the team that played the better game won. Period."
ussoccer,3bp70v,thebostinian,12,Wed Jul 1 02:01:50 2015 UTC,"I'm incredibly happy that we scored a second, simply because the US PK was a bad call."
ussoccer,3bp70v,Symbiotic_Disharmony,3,Wed Jul 1 02:14:03 2015 UTC,"Apparently the penalty that we got was called because the foul continued to occur within the box (basically, Morgan was still in contact with the defender as she crossed the 18). Not sure I agree with that assessment, but that's what FIFA said."
ussoccer,3bp70v,billthomson,13,Wed Jul 1 03:51:21 2015 UTC,"Well said, but you can't be too surprised that the Canadians would focus on that instead of the fact that the USA out played Germany hands down.   The hate us cause they ain't us..."
ussoccer,3bp70v,Symbiotic_Disharmony,10,Wed Jul 1 02:15:50 2015 UTC,"FWIW, Jennifer Hedger asked the panel at the end, ""Did the US deserve to win"", and each and every one of them looked at her and said ""No question, of course they did""."
ussoccer,3bp70v,ultracrepidarianist,3,Wed Jul 1 02:24:48 2015 UTC,"I think it would be hard to argue with that. Sure those two calls were certainly controversial, but neither really decided the match."
ussoccer,3bp70v,LJGremlin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:31:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but how often does the better team actually win? To go back one round, if you ask them who deserved the quarterfinal win, that panel would say France, not Germany. Didn't matter. Germany took their chances and France didn't. France was good; Germany was lucky.  And none of that matters anymore, because the US was both good and lucky. Lucky enough to get the FIFA tailwind in the two previous games, and the friendly calls; good enough to attack, dominate, and when called upon, finish.  If you'll excuse me, I have to go moon over pictures of KO for 23457 straight hours."
ussoccer,3bp70v,chuang-tzu,2,Wed Jul 1 13:00:00 2015 UTC,"There is no doubt that Johnston should have received a red.  There really is no debate there.  But I'll take a bad call in our favor any day of the week because I can go back and show many bad calls against us for both men and women.  As for the PK given, I was surprised it outside the box if for nothing else the benefit of the doubt.  The second goal does sort of make it feel less dirty had we won by that being the single goal.  It is also fair to note that one of the German players could have been given a second yellow and ejected in the first half.    Overall, I think the ref did a good job of letting two physical teams play without it getting overly chippy."
ussoccer,3bp70v,jsgg556,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:27:26 2015 UTC,"Not to mention that two of Germany's mids were desperately fortunate to have not been shown two yellows. Those fouls on Rapinoe alone were, hands down, yellow cards.  That wild tackle (can't remember the German's name) could have gone red as well.  Very malicious.  They seemed to be targeting Rapinoe.  Can't really blame them, as Rapinoe played like a possessed woman. All that said, Johnson should have been shown red. The U.S. pk I have little issue with, as the rule does say that if the foul carries into the box it can be awarded. However, if I was a German, I would have felt VERY hard done."
ussoccer,3bp70v,billthomson,-3,Wed Jul 1 17:13:32 2015 UTC,"penalty called on Krahn was outside the box.   I still don't know officially what foul was called. Her back was to the player she ""fouled"".   It wasn't a kick, trip, charge, strike, push, or tackle.  To be a PK, it needed to be one of those fouls.  The defender is allowed to occupy space and in my opinion she did not make an effort to impede Morgan. Even if one disagrees on impeding, that is obstruction and an indirect kick and not a penalty kick."
ussoccer,3bp70v,envican,6,Wed Jul 1 03:24:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was. Yes her back was to Morgan, but Krahn played through her, no contact or attempt on the ball. Easy foul call, questionable as to whether it was a penalty based on location of the foul only.  http://gfycat.com/MellowFlimsyBoto"
ussoccer,3bp70v,jsgg556,3,Wed Jul 1 03:35:46 2015 UTC,"yeah, it looked like a hockey hip check honestly"
ussoccer,3bp70v,billthomson,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:53:33 2015 UTC,"I still don't know what foul you think was called.  Simple question... What foul according to the rule book?  ""kick, trip, jump, charge, strike, push, tackle, hold, spit, handle the ball.""? http://i.imgur.com/6beuzD8.jpg  It sounds like you think it was obstruction which is not a PK.  Or are you calling the ""there was contact against the US so it's a foul"" foul?"
ussoccer,3bp70v,jsgg556,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:41:09 2015 UTC,"Tackle actually, if you watch the video - hence the link. BTW, very easy call for the foul, very hard call (in realtime for the ref) as to where it occurred."
ussoccer,3bp70v,billthomson,0,Thu Jul 2 03:47:34 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I watched the video.  The ole ""tackle using the back-side while moving away from the other player"" call.  I guess depending on your definition of ""tackle.""  http://i.imgur.com/mbBm2yv.jpg http://i.imgur.com/6beuzD8.jpg  Krahn is allowed to occupy space. She doesn't have a Harry Potter wand to make herself disappear whenever Alex Morgan wants to get past her.  She ""tackled"" Morgan using her backside?  Soccer would be unwatchable if that was called a foul every time it happened."
ussoccer,3bp70v,_Dr_Jan_Itor,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:29:11 2015 UTC,"Sure. But she doesn't have the right to run through Morgan, and it doesn't matter if she turns her back to Alex as she runs through her or not. FYI, I haven't heard anyone (except you) even vaguely object to calling a foul on Krahn, but it's pretty clear that the contact was initiated outside the area. Yet as England learned last night, it's pretty common to see a call like that that starts outside the area and finishes inside awarded a penalty."
ussoccer,3bp70v,RedRavens,9,Thu Jul 2 18:08:31 2015 UTC,"Let's give a hand to Jill Ellis. Really gutsy of her to change her tactics, even though we were all calling for it. Keeping Moe in the line up and pushing Carli forward worked perfectly. We outplayed the now former best team in the world."

ussoccer,3bp70v,FHlogin,2,Wed Jul 1 03:02:00 2015 UTC,"Fuckin-a, I'm glad they won and played that way so I can enjoy the run up to the final. The hand-wringing cry baby bullshit was so old and played out, people sounded like they were parroting the Australian FA after we beat them 3-1. All that about a team who conceded once in the tournament and gave up so few shots on goal that Hope Solo was able to make a cameo as the bird mask person in True Detective."

ussoccer,3bp70v,RedRavens,6,Wed Jul 1 01:31:18 2015 UTC,"Clearly the best game of the Cup so far. The passes and runs looked like we actually knew what we were doing rather than just forcing it forward. I never really had the feeling that we were giving up the middle of the field like we have been in other matches. Solid play plus a little luck, and we're on to the final!  Plus, my 2-year-old chanted ""USA! USA!"" about every time she heard the crowd chanting it. What fun!"
