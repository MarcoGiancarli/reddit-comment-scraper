3DSdeals,3e14xi,melvinman27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:58:50 2015 UTC,The box at the top il was different when I did it and now when I click that new link it offers me $40. So this card may actually be a different one: Here
3DSdeals,3e14xi,melvinman27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:31:42 2015 UTC,ah ok. How long ago did you apply for it?

I also read somewhere that the bonus fluctuates between $30 and $70 throughout the year, so maybe it'll change later, or..I'm not eligible for $70..maybe they don't like me :P  EDIT: I think I may contact customer support to see what's up..I'm becoming increasingly curious about this, and I want get to the bottom of it!"
3DSdeals,3e4vly,-Pimparoo-,2,Tue Jul 21 23:47:09 2015 UTC,"Fred meyer still has them at $179.99, that is $10 more then last week's ad price. It seems walmart's bundle(s) are complete crap right now but they have been somewhat ok in the past. As for getting a good price on a Lucario Amiibo, good fucking luck finding that on a store site but you could try ebay, they have some for less then $30. I guess you could check Craigslist also, might get lucky in your area.                BTW I downvoted you because you must not have been looking around for that long, if you had been that been then you should have done the Staple's deal or price matched the Fred Meyer. $30-$50 off a console that is only 6 month old and cost $200 max is more then I would expect. Then you ask about a possible Unicorn Amiibo.   Good luck on finding what you are looking for"
3DSdeals,3e4vly,9753157,0,Wed Jul 22 15:02:29 2015 UTC,Use VISA checkout at Staples.com with any order over $200 and get $50 off. So add a cheap charger to your order and you'll save $50. Then use that for any 3DS game you want :) The new Pokemon games are $29.99 on Walmart.com so that's a good start!

3DSdeals,3e0f58,planetarial,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:18:13 2015 UTC,SMT IV and Persona 3 are the best entry SMTs. SMT IV is like 20 bucks physically too.

3DSdeals,3e0f58,PlasmaMycos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:57:55 2015 UTC,"Hey m8, ive got about 20 hours in DeSU 2 and its been great so far. I've always been loosely into the SMT series but could never really get into it as they've had some pretty steep difficulty curves at times.   Its not as much of a tactics / SRPG ala final fantasy tactics. Its more like a checkerboard layout standard shin megami game. The demon fusing is great as always and you can even bid on new demons in the auction.   The story is also dark enough to keep you interested. Its not like the persona series where everything goes down surrounding a middle school. This is some end of days shit going on."
3DSdeals,3e0f58,saroph,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:00:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly I'd recommend either DeSu 1 or this over SMT IV as an entry game. The first game, at least in terms of atmosphere/story, is better than the second IMO. While I have Record Breaker, I haven't played it yet (beat the original on the DS) and can't speak to its improvements over Overclocked. Either way, the DeSu games seem much more forgiving than SMT IV, especially for beginners."
3DSdeals,3e0f58,easterreddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:03:00 2015 UTC,"If you have a Vita, get P4G.  If you have a 3DS, get SMT4.  From there, you have two choices:  Go further along the Persona hypetrain; you're a few years late but it's never too late! with P3P, P2 duology, P1 (ehhh), or get a PS3/4 for Persona 5.  Go further along the SMT hole with Soul Hackers & Devil Survivor on 3DS, or onto PlayStation for the rest."

3DSdeals,3dyzdu,Gaseous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:10:26 2015 UTC,Yes but when is the discount applied? I'm not going to checkout with full prices with the hopes that they will discount it after the order.  I added the 3ds and MM to my cart and didn't see any discount applied. I didn't buy it but I got far enough in the checkout process that I felt like I should have. I reached out to Fry's last night but haven't heard back from them yet.
3DSdeals,3dyzdu,adsrmedia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:02:52 2015 UTC,Do not add the two items separately from the site. Look up 8531049 or  8531039 in the search bar on their website and purchase one or the other.   The asterisk is there for people purchasing in the physical store. As long as you make the purchase online using either of those PLU numbers ( 8531049 or  8531039) then you'll get the 3ds and the game together for $199.99.
3DSdeals,3dyzdu,Gaseous,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:04:27 2015 UTC,should I get this? staples deal seems like its finished. I really didn't want to spend 200$ on system alone so this seems like a good one.

3DSdeals,3dqo6v,soupen,3,Mon Jul 20 04:29:40 2015 UTC,I think you're supposed to break $200 before you can get the 50 off.  So you need $0.01 more in your cart.

3DSdeals,3dohib,Stardust-Nova,3,Sat Jul 18 21:57:12 2015 UTC,Not so great. The graphics look compressed like a low quality jpeg and there's no multiplayer.

3DSdeals,3dqy27,Legolihkan,6,Sat Jul 18 16:33:06 2015 UTC,There is a deal going on right now at Staples. They are giving 50$ off of purchases made with a visa card (credit or debit) online that are 200$ or more. That would make the value of the N3DS only 150$.  Take note that the value of the 3DS is 199.99 on their website so you have to add something else to the purchase to receive the 50$ discount.  Shipping is also free.  Hope this helps.
3DSdeals,3dqy27,elephant-shoe,-3,Sat Jul 18 20:31:46 2015 UTC,"Yea, unfortunately i dont have a visa card"

3DSdeals,3dqy27,jnmxcvi,2,Sun Jul 19 21:33:56 2015 UTC,I can attest to that. I recently jumped onto the $60 refurbished 2DS and it came in the factory packaging as brand new. Literally if any other place sold it to me like they did I would have literally no clue it was even refurbished because there was no physical wear and the battery life is amazing. Off a full charge I can play for hours on end.
3DSdeals,3dqy27,Theprofessor1000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:11:43 2015 UTC,Would you ever consider a 2DS?

I might consider it if the price difference is extreme, though."
3DSdeals,3dqy27,jnmxcvi,2,Sat Jul 18 16:56:43 2015 UTC,Here are some refurbed 3ds xls: https://store.nintendo.com/ng3/browse/subcategory.jsp?categoryId=cat50005&pageSize=6&viewAll=true   And refurbed 2ds: https://store.nintendo.com/ng3/browse/subcategory.jsp?categoryId=cat200014  Good prices and I hear that the quality is high.

He will admit to not using the 3D part because it hurts your eyes after like 2-3 minutes of usage. He told me about the $60 2DS deal and I picked that up. It's definitely not portable, but I just sorta carry it around? It's honestly really fun and imo worth it. The controls are really comfortable in the hand more than you'd think. I got the blue crystal and I have nothing but good things to say about it."
3DSdeals,3dqy27,Karbonation,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:15:53 2015 UTC,"Just seconding the notion that 3d isn't that useful for everyone. It's very finicky and rely only works at very specific angles, at least on the OG 3ds. It also doesn't add that much to immersion or gameplay except in very few and select instances"
3DSdeals,3dqy27,bnoonan037,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:06:18 2015 UTC,"Gamestop is set to have a lot of used ones.  I just traded in my NM 3DS and my brothers also NM 3DS for a new 3DS.  Though there aren't any titles for it, I couldn't pass up just sitting on them and have them collect dust.  I'd rather have it to play new titles then wishing I upgraded and buying one at full retail and have handhelds I'll never use laying around.  The best deal right now is probably the Staples deal for a n3DS, if you stick with Amazon you won't see much of any deals/bundles until Nintendo releases a bundle SKU (which usually is a limited edition n3DS)."
3DSdeals,3do8td,mejjos,3,Fri Jul 17 21:57:32 2015 UTC,Anyone got any input on this? Good? Bad?

3DSdeals,3dk12j,retropyor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:06:41 2015 UTC,I think I read somewhere that Ubisoft's summer sale starts on Monday.
3DSdeals,3dj0z1,PurelyNicole,4,Thu Jul 16 17:43:49 2015 UTC,That's not really a very good sale since it's $16.60 on Amazon and the MSRP is listed at $19.99.  Kohl's is just doing their normal tactic of raising the MSRP to make the discount look bigger it seems.
3DSdeals,3dj0z1,rarelypost,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:12:21 2015 UTC,"I should've known to compare the MSRP. I knew it was close to the Amazon price, which is why I thought it was a decent deal. Especially if your local store had it and you could just go get it."
3DSdeals,3dj127,mejjos,2,Thu Jul 16 17:44:32 2015 UTC,The reviews for this one are fairly middling. Anyone have any thoughts on it?
3DSdeals,3dh58m,Skelotic,3,Thu Jul 16 06:01:33 2015 UTC,Hey people who played this... how good is this game? I'm really interested in it.
3DSdeals,3dh58m,janosaudron,3,Thu Jul 16 17:51:13 2015 UTC,"I got really hooked on this game without ever playing the previous ones. I really liked the combat and party customization. I had a lot of fun coming up with character builds that worked well together in a party.   Some negatives I can think of would be that the story is not good, and there will be a lot of back tracking especially at the start. It might have just been the classes I chose but I would run out of TP (points for skill usage) right before a boss, have to go back to town, then fight my way back to the boss again."
3DSdeals,3dh58m,meagrelion,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:29:58 2015 UTC,"I too am curious. I'm currently torn between Etrian Odyssey IV and Persona Q. Haven't played previous persona games, but I am a big fan of Shin Megami Tensei.   Do they feel significantly different?"
3DSdeals,3dh58m,Amadaun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:00:25 2015 UTC,"I Played 3 and 4, and they are, somewhat similar (they share some mosters, most skills) but they tend to do more emphasis in the social aspect of the characters."
3DSdeals,3dh58m,janosaudron,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:10:56 2015 UTC,"I am sorry, I found your wording a little confusing.  Persona 3 and 4 are the only games you named, and it sounds as though you are comparing them..?"
3DSdeals,3dh58m,Amadaun,2,Thu Jul 16 18:14:16 2015 UTC,"You are right that was shittily worded, I played Persona 3 and 4 and SMT nocturne and devil survivor 1 and 2. Comparing Persona to SMT, they have similarities in skills and monsters but storywise they feel a lot different."
3DSdeals,3dh58m,janosaudron,2,Thu Jul 16 18:46:24 2015 UTC,"Okay, cool. I have played SMT: Devil Survivor (tactical rpg), SMT: Strange Journey, SMT: IV, and the SMT MMORPG. Also, Etrian Odyssey 3.  The question I failed to ask was if Persona Q feels like Etrian Odyssey proper."
3DSdeals,3dh58m,Amadaun,2,Thu Jul 16 19:23:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, lol, I have no idea."
3DSdeals,3dh58m,janosaudron,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:43:16 2015 UTC,Persona Q is just Etrian Odyssey 4 with Persona fanservice slapped on top. It gives you the general idea of the game but you have more customization with characters in EO4.

3DSdeals,3dh8bu,Skynetz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:56:49 2015 UTC,Strange Journey for the DS. It has elements used in SMTIV and will help you get used to the dungeon crawling roots of the franchise.
3DSdeals,3dh8bu,GladeSocket,2,Fri Jul 17 02:40:10 2015 UTC,"got it, thanks"
3DSdeals,3dh8bu,Skynetz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:41:43 2015 UTC,Strange Journey is a favorite of mine. You'll have fun.
3DSdeals,3dh8bu,Amadaun,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:48:39 2015 UTC,I've heard very good things. I have it on my DS flashcart along with a bunch of other DS games I never played. I was thinking about picking up DeSu: Overclocked as well or should I play the original on the DS?
3DSdeals,3dh8bu,Skynetz,0,Fri Jul 17 15:37:33 2015 UTC,"I haven't found a difference between the overclocked and original, but I haven't played all the way through either. I find grinding levels in a tactical rpg to be extremely tedious, but that is just me.  More importantly, go find The World Ends With You.  Best game Square Enix has made, in my opinion."
3DSdeals,3dh8bu,Amadaun,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:58:31 2015 UTC,"Not a great intro. It's a remastered port of a Sega Saturn game, so it's quite a bit aged. Get SMT IV and if that's what you like, definitely go for it because Soul Hackers is amazing."
3DSdeals,3df0vy,Porkpants81,10,Wed Jul 15 19:30:13 2015 UTC,Terrible.
3DSdeals,3df0vy,Theprofessor1000,8,Wed Jul 15 19:39:57 2015 UTC,This whole Prime day has been a joke.  I was looking to get a power brick to charge my phone and such and regular price on Amazon was $19.99. The Lightning Deal price was $14.99 and it said it was 83% because they advertised the original MSRP as $80-somthing dollars...
3DSdeals,3df0vy,Mr_Holmes,2,Wed Jul 15 19:42:06 2015 UTC,This whole Prime day has been a joke.   Seriously. I wouldn't have cared if they hadn't billed it as bigger than Black Friday. Their Black Friday deals are generally awesome. The only thing I got is the gift card deal because I buy from Amazon enough that it's like free money for me.
3DSdeals,3df0vy,PurelyNicole,2,Wed Jul 15 19:46:34 2015 UTC,The only thing I've gotten so far is one Skylander Trapmaster that my daughter didn't have...$6.99 for one was an Ok deal since they're usually 14.99 in stores.
3DSdeals,3df0vy,This-Is-My-Moment,2,Wed Jul 15 19:49:38 2015 UTC,I was looking at this power brick that just went on sale:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M1LVCG2?ref_=gb1h_tit_m-7_6402_0ae6c8fb&smid=A18M12GR6V2Z8F  Original Amazon price is $19.99.  The Lightning Deal price is $19.19....seriously WTF Amazon you suck.
3DSdeals,3df0vy,This-Is-My-Moment,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:51:39 2015 UTC,I got a few things that were decent. I bought a radar detector for $160 that was recently on Woot for $180. The hardcover Divergent Trilogy for $15 (half of typical Amazon price). And a new gaming headset for $35 ($15 off typical Amazon price). But overall? Disapointing.
3DSdeals,3df0vy,Celebrandas,3,Wed Jul 15 20:01:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean things are certainly cheaper than normal, but I hate the deception in the % off amounts since Amazon doesn't sell for anywhere near the price they're saying."
3DSdeals,3df0vy,Sunio,5,Wed Jul 15 20:03:39 2015 UTC,"It's essentially getting the charger for free, nothing special for sure, but if you don't have an N3DSXL yet, it's slightly better than paying $200 for console only....I suppose..."
3DSdeals,3df0vy,manroth,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:30:58 2015 UTC,you can get it used for 169
3DSdeals,3df0vy,drtchock,3,Wed Jul 15 19:38:25 2015 UTC,You can always buy used things cheaper than new....your point is?
3DSdeals,3df0vy,reeegiii,3,Wed Jul 15 19:40:31 2015 UTC,It's hardly a deal you can also get it new on Amazon for 185 so you aren't saving much at all

3DSdeals,3d56yn,Doc_Bong,6,Mon Jul 13 22:47:32 2015 UTC,Will I need my old system to transfer account data or game saves to the new system? Or do I just pull the SD card from the old one and pop it in the new?
3DSdeals,3d56yn,porthius,3,Mon Jul 13 17:25:43 2015 UTC,Yes you will need the old system to do a system transfer.
3DSdeals,3d56yn,ss4444gogeta,6,Mon Jul 13 19:41:37 2015 UTC,"Gamestop usually let's you switch over your data right there in the store, correct?"
3DSdeals,3d56yn,JSchirmacher,5,Mon Jul 13 17:50:06 2015 UTC,"Your mileage may vary, not every store has wifi. And if you aren't using a microSD with your current 3DS, you'll need one for the New 3DS to transfer your console's data (or not if you play mostly physical games and some small digital games) and a Phillips #00 to remove the backplate and switch the microSD cards after the transfer.  Though people have been able to come back to the store for the discount after they've first payed for the console and did the transfer themselves at home. But again, YMMV.  https://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/wiki/systemtransfer"

3DSdeals,3d56yn,Infinitedaw,2,Mon Jul 13 17:07:32 2015 UTC,Also note the new 3DS XL won't have a charger

Defective items may be eligible for trade at a lesser value.  Trades subject to manager approval. Cannot be combined with any other offer.  See store associate for details.  No dealers.

GameStop, Inc. reserves the right to cancel, terminate, modify or suspend the offer for any reason without notice.  FAQ (the answers are based on a users previous/current experience with this promotion) ~ from Cheap Ass Gamer   Q: Will trading in multiple systems stack? A: Multiple consoles do stack so trading in 2 2DS systems will get you $200 credit, but it is up to the employee to accept the trade of both systems.  It is possible for the employee to refuse to trade in multiple systems toward the promotion. Q: What do you need to trade in? A: System and charger (but charger does not have to be first party). Q: Can you return the N3DS for full credit? A: Yes, but I suggest going to a different Gamestop and waiting a few days before doing so.  Employees might threaten to manually adjust refund credit, but I do not believe that is possible.  Although, if this happens just find another gamestop to return your system.  It's not worth the hassle."

The larger screen is really nice and the extra features of the N3DS are worth $100, especially if you've gotten quite a bit of use out of your 3DS by this point. The face tracking 3D is a major improvement."

You can see a dozens of recent listings that went for varying prices depending on how much of the packaging and other included bonuses are included.  Even if you sold it today with just the system you could probably get more than $100 for it, let alone if you wait longer and keep it in good condition."

3DSdeals,3d56yn,ss4444gogeta,4,Wed Jul 15 20:21:09 2015 UTC,So refurbished 2ds systems are $75 on Nintendo's site. You can order one to trade in and essentially make a $25 profit.

3DSdeals,3ccmtj,cados,2,Wed Jul 8 00:19:56 2015 UTC,i've sold a few things there.  They're legit.
3DSdeals,3c4vea,Crossed_Chasm,2,Sat Jul 4 20:25:17 2015 UTC,If only I didn't already own all of these games.
3DSdeals,3c4vea,vader1116,2,Sat Jul 4 23:02:47 2015 UTC,So have sales plateaued? Kinda wish I had waited to get my new 3DS...
3DSdeals,3c4vea,jatorres,2,Sun Jul 5 02:36:24 2015 UTC,"On a slightly different note, the email Nintendo sent out for this was really scummy. The email subject was something along the lines of ""Get a FREE Nintendo 3DS Game!!"" and of course, when you the email, it tells you that you need to spend $200 first. Absolute clickbait."
3DSdeals,3c4vea,bearkin1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:01:54 2015 UTC,"It says June 25th until July 8th, the offer was announced June 23rd, but I didn't get the email about it until July 3rd, and internet issues kept me from finding out until almost the last day of the sale. (Or maybe the last day of the sale depending on when it ends.) Kind of annoying.  I was going to hold out and see what kind of deal I could get for the supposed Amazon sale next week, but getting the NN3DSXL at full price with a free game works for me just as well. Thanks for the heads up, like bearkin1 commented, I honestly wouldn't have bothered with the email from how they worded it."
3DSdeals,3c4vea,Zaradros,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:04:32 2015 UTC,"No problem, I got the email late as well. I posted this deal the day I got it."

3DSdeals,3bx922,goose-is-good,6,Thu Jul 2 22:22:38 2015 UTC,"That's the thing with this unit, unless you have a bag to throw it in, it's pretty terrible for portability. It absolutely is not pocketable, unless you have a jacket with huge pockets or a hoody."

3DSdeals,3bx922,goose-is-good,5,Fri Jul 3 01:39:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I upgraded from the 2DS to the N3DSXL, and it's not much better for portability. I do feel like the clamshell design prevents it from getting too much hate for it's un-pocketability.   For the most part, any 3DS besides the original design is pretty awful for pocketing. Here's hoping these N3DS non-XL rumors are true. Not that I'd get one, but there is definitely a desire for them."
3DSdeals,3bx922,Gr8NonSequitur,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:57:52 2015 UTC,"At this point I'd be thrilled with a ""new 2DS XL"". My son's 2DS isn't any less portable / pocketable than my XL in real terms, and it's more comfortable to hold than the XL and I rarely use the 3D. I would miss the larger screen and battery though, that's really the sticking point for me."
3DSdeals,3bx922,goose-is-good,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:02:32 2015 UTC,"It's always a possibility, in all honesty. The rumors come from. Reggie saying there'll be new SKUs in the 3DS family. Everyone's just assuming it means non XL N3DS's, unless there's some new news I haven't seen yet."

3DSdeals,3bx922,Rapboy24,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:50:33 2015 UTC,"Was thinking about getting a 2DS for my nephew's birthday; he's 6. Does anyone have experience with kids using these? I'd like to get him into gaming outside of junk on ipads / phones. I have a 3DS XL and feel like he would break the hinges on that easily. The only thing I'm really worried about for the 2DS is if it would be too big for his hands, anyone have thoughts or experiences on this?"
3DSdeals,3bx922,victoryforZIM,3,Fri Jul 3 02:42:34 2015 UTC,"I have no experience with kids but based on what I know the 2DS was designed for kids because it has no 3d and they are less breakable. They said that the 3d on a regular 3d would hurt children's eyes so that's is why they came up with a 2DS.  Edit: a 6 year old hand would be perfect, on YouTube there's my commercial that shows little kids playing it."
3DSdeals,3bx922,rhpot1991,2,Fri Jul 3 04:45:43 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what I was thinking, thanks for confirming. I ordered one, this price is too good anyway."
3DSdeals,3bx922,victoryforZIM,2,Fri Jul 3 05:00:45 2015 UTC,Being able to read well is a barrier on a lot of games.  Kirby and Nintendogs should be manageable.
3DSdeals,3bx922,rhpot1991,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:43:35 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of those as well, and possibly Animal Crossing with some significant help at the start. Maybe New Super Mario Bros 2 or maybe some VC gameboy games, something that he will struggle with but should still be able to advance."
3DSdeals,3bx922,victoryforZIM,2,Fri Jul 3 04:49:53 2015 UTC,Animal crossing was one of the ones I was thinking when I mentioned reading.  Mario games should be good.  Mario Kart 7 would be a great fit and then you can multiplayer too.
3DSdeals,3bx922,santaman123,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:03:04 2015 UTC,"yeah, mario kart 7 seems like a good choice."
3DSdeals,3bx922,rhpot1991,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:44:29 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily agree with this.  I learned how to read by playing Pokémon, even though there were ""big words."" I managed to get through the games, understanding most of what was going on, and even learned in the process of doing so. Games that require reading are beneficial and definitely worthwhile."
3DSdeals,3bw7fm,Crossed_Chasm,5,Thu Jul 2 17:34:55 2015 UTC,"Forgot to put this in, but the sale lasts until July 16"

3DSdeals,3bw7fm,teleporterdown,4,Thu Jul 2 19:30:01 2015 UTC,"Definitely the trilogy, you need to start from the beginning if you want to appreciate Dual Destinies."
3DSdeals,3bw7fm,VritraReiRei,5,Thu Jul 2 19:42:40 2015 UTC,"I went with the trilogy. No lie, I was going to o buy this or DD yesterday. I've been playing a Professor Layton game and it got me interested in PW somehow. Glad I waited to buy."

3DSdeals,3bw7fm,victoryforZIM,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:43:19 2015 UTC,Dual Destinies is the 5th installment of the series. I highly recommend playing them all in order to appreciate DD. Apollo Justice especially because there are plot points that are referenced not to mention returning characters from the entire franchise returning that you would only get excited for if you knew about them
3DSdeals,3bw7fm,mrdarby90,4,Thu Jul 2 23:47:24 2015 UTC,Starting from the beginning is a good start.
3DSdeals,3bw7fm,Elaboration,2,Thu Jul 2 19:33:28 2015 UTC,"Nice, was waiting for the trilogy to go on sale. I already picked up DD when it was on sale before but I haven't played it yet, now I can play them with some sort of order."
3DSdeals,3bw7fm,kturtle17,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:27:38 2015 UTC,So I was thinking about buying these. I've put in a few hours on the first game on iOS. I noticed that the prices are slightly cheaper on iOS but obviously the experience would be better on my xl.   I was wondering would my experience be much richer of if spent the extra but if money rather than trying to play on a phone?
3DSdeals,3bw7fm,Romiress,2,Thu Jul 2 20:51:10 2015 UTC,"I don't own either of these games, but I know that the 3d capabilities always make me pick the 3ds over any other platform for games."
3DSdeals,3bw7fm,kturtle17,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:03:21 2015 UTC,Anyone know if PLvs.AA will ever go on sale?
3DSdeals,3bw7fm,ssunlimited,2,Thu Jul 2 22:38:11 2015 UTC,"You can find physical copies so it's less likely to go on sale. These are digital only, so eShop sales are more important."
3DSdeals,3bw7fm,dr3amsINdigital,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:11:10 2015 UTC,I see. I want to play this game but I also don't buy 3DS games full price. As an AA fan I am desperately looking for a sale on this game.
3DSdeals,3bw7fm,idlesiren,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:29:07 2015 UTC,I have a question; what is the point of getting these games if you own them on IOS? Not just me but anyone. I own both of these games on IOS and beat them on my iPad. They're cheap for the IOS.

3DSdeals,3bogtd,dr3amsINdigital,18,Tue Jun 30 21:20:11 2015 UTC,I heard this game blows donkey dicks. Even die-hard Attack on Titan fans think its shite.

3DSdeals,3bogtd,Crossed_Chasm,3,Wed Jul 1 02:38:15 2015 UTC,"This game sucks. I've never watched the series, nor do I plan to. I have no clue why I bought it, and regret it every time I see it on my home screen."
3DSdeals,3bogtd,ChannelSaidin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:15:35 2015 UTC,I have tried to look at gameplay but what are the things you hate about?  I really like the manga/anime and would like to support it so better games are ported but I keep getting disheartened. Bad controllers?  Bugs?  Repetitive missions?
3DSdeals,3bogtd,elguitarro,2,Fri Jul 3 06:40:11 2015 UTC,"I should note that I haven't seen the anime.  It is certainly a game for fans of the show.  I thought the coolness of flying around and killing big naked people would make up for it.  The graphics are shitty, and when you see a Titan far away, instead of doing what most games do and draw lower quality textures, this game draws lower quality animations.  The result looks ridiculous.  The missions are extremely repetitive, but I suppose if these big things attack the city and a stab in the neck is what does the deed, it would be pretty repetitive.  I'm constantly flying around via ODMgear, at first it was exciting, but soon resulted in a boredom.  Fly, cut leg, fly, cut neck, etc.  I haven't played the online portion.  I've tried, but it doesn't explain the UI enough that I haven't been able to get into a group and actually go out.  I've beaten the single player story arcs via 2 characters so far, but haven't been playing it anymore.  Maybe the online portion is a God send for this game, but I'm not going to find out.  Watch some more videos of gameplay though, if your a huge fan of the show, it might be worth it to pick it up on sale."
3DSdeals,3bogtd,ChannelSaidin,2,Fri Jul 3 11:05:22 2015 UTC,now it's only 29.99 more than it's worth! Enjoy this qte simulator cash grab and definitely don't play the free unity game that is better in every aspect

3DSdeals,3bkg6d,thesk8rguitarist,7,Mon Jun 29 23:16:56 2015 UTC,The main place that I've seen consistent discount eshop cards have been Fry's. If you live by one I would suggest signing up for the daily promo code emails. It comes with there daily and weekly deals.   Every week or every other week there's usually a deal for 20% off of a $20 eshop card but its almost always in store only and you must have a promo code to receive the 20% off.
3DSdeals,3bkg6d,jyang80,10,Tue Jun 30 04:43:52 2015 UTC,Good luck.
3DSdeals,3bkg6d,froakiefroak,3,Mon Jun 29 23:17:24 2015 UTC,"Super, insanely rare. You'll see a very small discount maybe every other month (like, $5 off a $50 card). I've seen them go over 25% maybe once in three years."
3DSdeals,3bkg6d,Romiress,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:31:19 2015 UTC,I remember Best Buy have like 25% sale a few times years ago and I always look at eShop cards going for discounts to no avail.
3DSdeals,3bkg6d,Romiress,5,Mon Jun 29 23:34:30 2015 UTC,"Closest I've seen in years is 'buy one, get one 25% off' which is really 12.5% discount.  Best Buy did 15% off for black friday.  Anything big will be posted here, but you really shouldn't expect to get 50% off."

3DSdeals,3bkg6d,eddiemancia,2,Tue Jun 30 05:55:31 2015 UTC,"Keep an eye on eBay!  They have discounts on eBay gift cards pretty often.  Small discounts, but you can then ""roll"" your existing gift cards to buy more eBay gift cards the next time they have a sale on them, which'll result in a bigger discount over time.  And then you can use the eBay gift cards to buy eShop gift cards through Best Buy's eBay store.  (If you do Swagbucks, you can also redeem your points for eBay gift cards through there, which you can then redeem for eShop cards -- see link above.  First $25 redemption per month has an 12% discount, too.)"
3DSdeals,3bkg6d,Lord_Firestorm,2,Tue Jun 30 21:01:28 2015 UTC,Fry's electronics. Their email promo code takes (20%) $4 off the $20 dollar eshop card (limit 1 per customer). They had the deal yesterday. Today they have the xbox $25 at $15.
3DSdeals,3bkg6d,tucofring,2,Thu Jul 2 16:10:35 2015 UTC,"Target used to apply their employee discount to eShop cards, but I don't know if they still do. Make some friends at Target/Walmart/GameStop/Best Buy and ask if their discounts apply.    Also, last time I was trading stuff in to Gamestop I discovered that their gift cards could be applied to eShop cards, effectively allowing you to redeem old games for digital downloads."

3DSdeals,3bd2bf,thewaitaround,2,Sun Jun 28 09:13:28 2015 UTC,"Best advice is to try the demo.  On paper, I should love Codename Steam. Turn-based, Steampunk strategy RPG from the makers of Fire Emblem and Advance Wars? There's no part of that description I don't like.  But I started the demo and everything felt off. I didn't like the art design, I didn't like the writing, I didn't like the characters, and the combat felt clunky and tedious. The worst part by far was the enemy turn, where you're staring at a wall for what seems like eternity. They've cut that down to half an eternity now, thankfully.  Thus the mixed response. Some people love it, while others expected to love it but bounced off. It's not a bad game, but it's no Fire Emblem or Advance Wars."
3DSdeals,3bd2bf,RebelWithoutACog,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:59:15 2015 UTC,I just played the demo. I'm going out to get it now. The demo is long enough to get a good taste of the game.

3DSdeals,3aydaw,Trifky,3,Wed Jun 24 14:20:03 2015 UTC,I actually don't even have either and I can't understand what the game play is like... Can anyone explain better than the reviews?
3DSdeals,3aydaw,KibblesNKirbs,5,Wed Jun 24 17:35:13 2015 UTC,"SMT4 is turn based first person combat, you get 1 turn for each party member (party members being you and up to 3 demons), you only spend half a turn for hitting elemental weaknesses and lose turns for hitting strengths/nulls/reflects/drains. Combat strategy is mostly preparing for the fight by spending time fusing demons together, as a properly prepared team will have a much easier time with some of the games harder bosses (and they are substantially harder than most games these days, many reviewers complain about the first 2 bosses especially for being obnoxiously hard)  Devil survivor has similar in battle mechanics, but instead of traditional rpg gameplay on the map it's a grid turn based strategy rpg. Before you initiate battle it plays like fire emblem or front mission, with special map skills depending on your demon teams, and once you initiate battle it plays like SMT4 except each team only gets 1 (or 2 if you hit weaknesses properly) of combat."
3DSdeals,3aydaw,Celebrandas,2,Wed Jun 24 18:51:33 2015 UTC,"It's basically like a much, much more difficult and involved Pokemon. You collect the demons by convincing them the join you (instead of catching them, you talk to them during battles and hope they join you). The combat is brutally difficult and unforgiving at first, but it gets better once you get some better attacks, a few strong demons, and level up a few times."
3DSdeals,3aydaw,AdamManHello,2,Wed Jun 24 18:53:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is it right here. Gonna pull the trigger on SMT IV. It's always seemed right up my alley, but I've put it off for some reason. Here we go!"

3DSdeals,3aydaw,KibblesNKirbs,4,Wed Jun 24 18:46:04 2015 UTC,"DSO plotwise focuses on teenagers trapped in a government city wide lockdown with demons and angels, it's much more character focused than SMT4. Expect substantially more dialogue and more nuanced characters. If you liked the gameplay in SMT4, DSO does a pretty good job mixing in traditional SMT gameplay with SRPG elements, as it still has fusing and a variation of press turn, while having grid based strategy. There's a time system for in game events as well, like persona, so if you feel pressured by time sensitive events then it might not be the game for you. Your decisions affect how the lockdown gets resolved and who lives/dies."

3DSdeals,3a2n2z,planetarial,4,Tue Jun 16 20:38:46 2015 UTC,I can't really understand buying carts for a portable system. Why would you not want your entire collection with you anytime you take the 3DS anywhere?
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,forkyfork,14,Tue Jun 16 20:30:27 2015 UTC,"It's cheaper most of the time, especially if you buy used. You can for instance Curtain Call for $20 physically sometimes but its never dropped below $40 digitally. The only exceptions are rare sales (that are sometimes still not as cheap as buying it physically) or if its an atlus game. You can resell it if you dont like it. I got bored of ACNL after a while and sold it to cover half the cost of Bravely Default. I also bought Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate digitally when it was on sale and regret it and now wish I could resell it. You can't get special editions or physical goodies digitally. I like having a box on the shelf. Saves SD card space. If you go almost entirely physically you can get away with smaller SD cards whereas you need at least a 32GB card if you go digital.   Also carrying around a cart collection isn't a problem for me. I have a Club Nintendo 3DS case that carries my 3DS/DS collection that I put in my purse."
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,bearkin1,9,Tue Jun 16 21:37:55 2015 UTC,They hold better resell value. And my ds case holds 6 carts.   I do wish I hadn't bought fantasy life in hard copy. That would be a good digital copy to go back to. Oh well
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,tucofring,5,Tue Jun 16 20:32:24 2015 UTC,"Why would you not want your entire collection with you anytime you take the 3DS anywhere?   Some games where they have a hard cut off for completion aren't really needed for that. And on the contrary, physical games can be resold and loaned, and usually offer deeper discounts (thought that's not a reason in this case since it's the digital being discounted). A game like Ocarina of Time I would not want digital. As soon as I beat it, it would collect dust until I sell it or play it again."
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,bearkin1,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:49:12 2015 UTC,The carts are  small. It's not like it's a full disc. You should  also consider your purchase an asset.  It is no longer an asset when it no longer has any monetary  value. I can't  see any reason to buy digital unless you don't like carrying  your 3ds in a case or are prone to losing your cartridges anyway.
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,forkyfork,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:19:17 2015 UTC,Digital isn't a terrible idea. There are mini trash encounters that spawn occasionally on the map which are good for bonus items and EXP. Having it always on your system would be handy to knock those out. There's not much else of a reason other than that though.
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Ariwara_no_Narihira,2,Tue Jun 16 20:46:39 2015 UTC,For the trash encounters how do you know when to log in?  Is there any way to get my Fantasy Life save transferred to my digital copy?
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Verivus,2,Tue Jun 16 20:58:50 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's saved on the system and not the cart.
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Coraldragon,2,Tue Jun 16 21:50:43 2015 UTC,"No, it's saved on the cart."
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Verivus,2,Wed Jun 17 04:07:41 2015 UTC,Fantasy Life actually saves progress on the SD card. Try putting it in a different 3DS and your save won't be there.
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Coraldragon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:21:45 2015 UTC,"Huh, TIL. I wish it wasn't that way."
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,bearkin1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:31:27 2015 UTC,well if you each have your own 3DS it makes sharing easier because you don't have to worry about them messing with your save.  It's the only one that I know of that saves all the progress on the SD card. Most only put part of it like the DLC or streetpasses.
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Coraldragon,2,Wed Jun 17 04:38:07 2015 UTC,"No idea about the fantasy life thing.  For Fire Emblem, there are no external notifications. But at the start of every hour, certain things can proc, including trash spawn. I think like maybe 4 a day is a typical number?"
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,shwaabz,2,Tue Jun 16 21:56:19 2015 UTC,"there is a save transfer tool in the eShop to move your save from cartridge to system. Though Fantasy Life already saves everything on the SD card, so don't know if it's needed."
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,bearkin1,3,Wed Jun 17 04:21:20 2015 UTC,Should I get fantasy life or fire emblem?
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Ferneras,3,Tue Jun 16 20:26:03 2015 UTC,Haven't played Fantasy Life but I've put almost 200 hours into Fire Emblem so I'm gonna say go with that one.
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,srushmore,3,Tue Jun 16 20:45:44 2015 UTC,"Played both and own both, can't go wrong. FL is more pick up and play, FE is more chunks of time."
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,bearkin1,2,Wed Jun 17 02:04:11 2015 UTC,That is going to be a tough decision...
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,aristride,4,Tue Jun 16 20:39:09 2015 UTC,Both are highly regarded but I rarely hear anyone saying anything bad about Fire Emblem. That's where my vote is.
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,shwaabz,2,Tue Jun 16 20:47:37 2015 UTC,what kind of games do you enjoy?
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,kondaskondas,3,Tue Jun 16 22:08:04 2015 UTC,"Xenoblade, advanced wars, animal crossing, pokemon, persona q"
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Kobeissi2,5,Tue Jun 16 22:14:49 2015 UTC,"Xenoblade and Animal crossing says Fantasy Life.  Advanced wars, pokemon and persona q says Fire Emblem.  Fantasy life is more light hearted and adventure but lacks difficulty on gameplay. Fire emblem is challenging and requires strategy."
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Coraldragon,2,Tue Jun 16 22:45:35 2015 UTC,The awkward moment when you own most of these games
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,pca1987,2,Wed Jun 17 03:07:22 2015 UTC,you mean the great moment!
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Dihnekis,2,Wed Jun 17 04:23:40 2015 UTC,"I'm completely on the fence here. I HATE nintendo's digital way of life, but these prices are amazing. I'm thinking about FE:A and maybe Fantasy Life.  Whatcha guys think? Is it possible that cartridges will be this price eventually? I'm not in a rush."
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,pca1987,5,Wed Jun 17 10:51:32 2015 UTC,These prices are far short of amazing for digital stuff. Console digital stores are so damn expensive compared to steam/origin.
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Mikedx42,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:22:00 2015 UTC,"yeah totally agreed. Makes no sense IMO for a download to cost the exact same thing as a cartridge that has all the logistics, manufacturing price, casing, etc"

3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Impaled_,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:25:16 2015 UTC,people say it's the retailer contract and how they won't sell the games without some guarantee it won't be lower than their sales.

3DSdeals,3a2n2z,pca1987,3,Wed Jun 17 11:37:56 2015 UTC,"I've been waiting for Fire Emblem to go on sale for the longest time. I don't think I've seen it down to $28 in the last year or so, although of course it's possible I missed some crazy deal somewhere. So I went ahead and bought it even though I don't much like Nintendo digital either.   I think Fantasy Life has a better chance of reaching this price though. The game itself is downright amazing."
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,bearkin1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:43:32 2015 UTC,thanks sir. Will probably buy Fire Emblem then
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,AshTheGoblin,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:06:32 2015 UTC,"Not the deepest discounts but then again, eShop usually isn't. I'm glad Minish Cap is on sale again. I always regretted not buying it before getting my Wii U like a week after its sale ended back during the Smash Bros weeklong sales.  I may also get Fantasy Life. I've wanted that for a while and I got no issue going digital for 3DS as opposed to Wii U since I have the memory for it."

3DSdeals,3a2n2z,AshTheGoblin,5,Tue Jun 16 22:52:12 2015 UTC,I really didn't like it. I got bored after only a few days.
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,ToiletSpiders,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:34:20 2015 UTC,I was thinking that would be the case. I can't seem to find a game in the entire eshop that I think would entertain me for more than a few days.
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,MFCH,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:56:59 2015 UTC,I have the same problem. I play my 3ds here and there. Really not much because games don't hold my interest much any more. I did like luigi's mansion though lol that's the only game I've finished so far.
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,hewtab,3,Wed Jun 17 01:19:31 2015 UTC,"It's the game I've played more and longer than any game on 3ds. There are limited things you can do in a day for the first bit, but for me, it's a great zen game to chill out to for 30 minutes everyday. Lighthearted and relaxing."
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Downfaller,2,Wed Jun 17 01:49:56 2015 UTC,"It really depends on wether or not you like the genre. It's a lighthearted life-sim game, and you can easily sink hundreds of hours into it. I personally love it and I find myself coming back to it every time."
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,zKarp,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:36:15 2015 UTC,Any good two+ player games?  I always like to pick those up on special since it make multiple copies affordable.
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Coraldragon,3,Tue Jun 16 23:47:01 2015 UTC,Mario Tennis. but it's actually cheaper to get the physical from Gamestop. Used - $12

3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Going_Down_On_Her_Fe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:13:11 2015 UTC,You start with 8 worlds that are pretty easy. I was at about 5 hours beating them but not 100%. You unlock 8 more worlds afterwards that I find are a lot harder. Still working on those..
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Mikedx42,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:22:31 2015 UTC,"I'm personally considering getting either A Link Between Worlds, or Shovel Knight. After some price research, ALBW looks like the cheapest it'll be, but I'm not entirely sure. What do ya'll think I should get?"
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Anersha,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:33:54 2015 UTC,"Shovel Knight is a great game, let there be no mistake about it.

3DSdeals,3a2n2z,welcome2thejam,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:42:30 2015 UTC,It's a great game and I had a blast playing it.    I was skeptical at first but didn't regret purchasing after playing it.  If you're a fan of fun video games then you won't be disappointed.
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Timobkg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:10:57 2015 UTC,"If you don't already know, KI:U basically does it where most of the time, the first half of a level will be an on-rail shooter, and the second half is more third person shooter. The gameplay's a lot of fun and it looks fantastic for a 3ds title. The story's a bit all over the place, but it makes up for it with some pretty great dialogue and memorable chararcters. Pretty decent amount of replayability too, with a weapon crafting system, adjustable difficulty scale (if you played the new Smash, it works just like the one on classic mode), and online multiplayer, though no idea how active that scene is.  I will agree with the common criticism that the control scheme for the game can lead to some hand cramping, but it's a good enough game for me to be able to look past it."
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,whitemocha,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:40:12 2015 UTC,"I thought it was really fun. I borrowed it not knowing what to expect, and after an hour I knew I had to buy it.  Great art design and graphics and really fun, fast paced action gameplay. The default controls are somewhat cumbersome, but turning on auto-fire solved that at the loss of charge shot which I rarely used.   I did find holding my 3DS XL one handed to be tiring after 45+ minutes, but not so bad that I couldn't finish a stage before taking a break, and it's easier if you hook the pinkie of your stylus hand under the system for support."

3DSdeals,3a2n2z,Mikedx42,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:41:01 2015 UTC,AC and Fantasy Life are amazing games. You can get dozens or even hundreds of hours of playtime from them. I can't comment on Star Fox because I've not played it.
3DSdeals,3a2n2z,planetarial,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:45:02 2015 UTC,"Do you like arcade shooters? Then Star Fox is your game. Don't expect hour long campaigns, it can be cleared in one sitting, although the fun is improving on your score in stages and earning medals."

3DSdeals,39vu5j,Drizu,2,Mon Jun 15 06:47:43 2015 UTC,"I would recommend 4 instead of Untold.   Pasted my reply from another thread  It is my favorite game series, can be quite difficult for newcomers of the genre. It's basically those old dungeon crawling games where you have to make your own map (provided on the touchscreen). Plenty of flexibility with your party, decent amount of side quests and things to unlock. Story is a bit lacking for 4 (basically make your own generic character/class), get Untold if you want some actual story (albeit it isn't really good either). There's also a demo in the eshop for both. I personally recommend 4 over Untold. Make sure to try the demo first, might not be to your liking. Each game should last you 30+ hours easily especially if you are a completionist"

3DSdeals,39vu5j,forkyfork,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:35:43 2015 UTC,no there isn't any voice acting in 4 besides NPC greetings as far as I can remember.
3DSdeals,39vu5j,gaboo_the_soul_eater,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:28:45 2015 UTC,"It is, as is IV.  Untold has a story mode (optional) which builds your starting party for you and gives you preset characters and story. The default difficulty is balanced for newcomers to the series (the casual difficulty removes all difficulty). It also has more ease of use features, such as fast teleport between floor levels and more auto-map options.  IV is the better game, IMO. I found building my own party, and iterating on it, more interesting. Where Untold has two main dungeons with tons of floors, IV has several dungeons with a few floors each and many smaller single-level dungeons which I found more interesting as each has its own personality and theme. Exploring the overland maps was also interesting. IV's easy difficulty is perfect for newcomers.  And while IV doesn't have the story of Untold, I never missed it (and I usually play games for the story), and you can find lots of interesting tidbits that kind of tell the story of the world. Also, if you get used to the ease-of-use additions in Untold, you may miss them if you play IV afterwards, whereas that's not the case of you go IV->Untold."

3DSdeals,394jow,Theprofessor1000,2,Tue Jun 9 12:52:37 2015 UTC,Just wanted to let you know that your link automatically defaults to the 5th page.
3DSdeals,394jow,xTreeCutterx,2,Tue Jun 9 09:13:21 2015 UTC,"yeah but they won't ship any of the good games, and don't have any stock in stores.  I have Bravely default,Starfox, and majoras mask in my cart and won't let me buy any of them :("
3DSdeals,394jow,95688it,7,Tue Jun 9 05:22:33 2015 UTC,"As someone who used to work in the Best Buy warehouse department I can shed a little light on this. Pre owned games get sent to the warehouse separately from everything else. Usually in small quantities, at least in my store, unless it was a newer title.   When somebody makes an online order we would actually get an alert and have to go find the product on the floor or in the back. We were supposed to pick it as fast as possible and in no more than 15 min max. This might be easy if we had several copies but it might be next to impossible if there were one or two. Searching the whole store for one small item was a nightmare. If it couldn't be found we would request it from another  store. Managers would sometimes go in person to pick up things like TVs  or whatever (you'd be surprised how easy it is to ""lose"" a 50 inch tv because of inventory mistakes or write off). Worst case scenario is having to cancel somebody's order which reflected badly on us but was supposed to just have the order default to a different store for the customer. But if there's no inventory elsewhere then obviously it couldn't.   Tldr: There is not generally a large  inventory of Pre owned games at Best Buy. They don't even directly sell the ones you turn in. Those are shipped out elsewhere. So it's very hit or miss."
3DSdeals,394jow,kappakeats,2,Tue Jun 9 10:09:29 2015 UTC,Seriously? What is the point then?
3DSdeals,394jow,JupitersClock,2,Tue Jun 9 05:35:27 2015 UTC,best buy is a shitty ass company. it really doesn't surprise me at all.  I added like 10 games to my cart to test it out and the only one they will ship is Zelda: link between worlds.

3DSdeals,38zalt,juleppunch,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:11:50 2015 UTC,I wouldn't presume that's from a high amount of demand.
3DSdeals,38zalt,Bloodpenguin,3,Tue Jun 9 00:51:01 2015 UTC,Just beware that this is the bilingual copy. If you're not looking for the original USA versions then this works just as well however keep in mind that they are different. (These copies sell for less then USA versions as well.)
3DSdeals,38zalt,Seltonik,3,Mon Jun 8 05:19:52 2015 UTC,Is there anything negatively different about the bilingual copy?
3DSdeals,38zalt,bearkin1,3,Mon Jun 8 20:02:32 2015 UTC,"Nah. There's the FR on the artwork, usually a french version of the manual as well, and in game language options sometimes."
3DSdeals,38zalt,Bloodpenguin,2,Mon Jun 8 21:25:07 2015 UTC,"The only difference is that you have the choice between French and English in the options. Like I mentioned though, this one aspect significantly lowers the value to most people. It's not considered a first print and isn't a USA version of the game but it is compatible with US systems. If you just want a copy to experience the game, these copies work just fine. Hope that helps!"
3DSdeals,38zalt,alejiososa,10,Tue Jun 9 01:56:12 2015 UTC,This game is worth 39.99 new
3DSdeals,38zalt,victoryforZIM,12,Mon Jun 8 03:16:29 2015 UTC,"Sadly it's not available for that and even used ones are going for $50 in some places. Typical Nintendo, they never produce enough and then we end up with ridiculous second hand market prices.   All that being said, it's available on the eShop for regular price so this is still a ripoff unless you really want a physical copy for some reason."
3DSdeals,38zalt,Rapboy24,7,Mon Jun 8 03:27:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's why I posted it. I was on the lookout for a physical copy that wasn't $50 or more. Figured $46.00 with free shipping for a new sealed copy was a steal, considering the inflated prices elsewhere."

3DSdeals,38zalt,Gr8NonSequitur,8,Mon Jun 8 13:25:54 2015 UTC,Why you gotta let facts get in the way of his anger?
3DSdeals,38zalt,victoryforZIM,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:31:43 2015 UTC,You're right. Damn Nintendo we're coming for you!
3DSdeals,38zalt,Steinuh,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:46:06 2015 UTC,"I said that it's on the eShop and 2-3 years of print is not enough when the console it's on is still relevant. For other systems if you want old games they're usually heavily discounted, but nintendo if you want old games you'll find them at completely jacked up prices and unless they offer all those game on the eShop, then they still have a serious issue that they refuse to deal with."
3DSdeals,38zalt,victoryforZIM,-3,Mon Jun 8 16:14:03 2015 UTC,Lol it came out in 2011. Yeah it sucks for people who got a system late but thats like expecting to find a semi-launch title for a system brand new a few years down the road.
3DSdeals,38zalt,Steinuh,0,Mon Jun 8 18:55:59 2015 UTC,"Your argument is ""lol too bad for people who want it, they should have gotten it earlier"". You should absolutely be able to, and can find launch titles for systems years down the road, especially when systems have backwards compatibility. I'll give you an example: a PS3 launch title Call of Duty 3 can be purchased brand new on Amazon for $18. The game came out 8 years ago and is still available. Nintendo is letting second hand markets make money on products they could be selling.  As long as a system or compatible system is being made, the game should still be getting produced - even if it's in limited quantities. I don't expect to go find a brand new gamecube game in the market, but if I want to buy a Wii game or 3DS game I shouldn't have to go to second hand markets."
3DSdeals,38zalt,amiiboo,-4,Mon Jun 8 19:19:58 2015 UTC,"It's not viable for them to keep producing a game that has a small market of people who still want to buy it. The people who wanted to buy it, bought it when they could. Sorry you were too slow to get it while you could. Nintendo still gives you the option to buy it digitally so that they dont have to print extra copies."
3DSdeals,38zalt,TedIsReal,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:50:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, it's called after market. Stuff goes out of production, supply and demand kick in. It's not unfair, the unfairness happens when they are still being made and scalpers step in between the consumers and retailers and control the stock (glaring at you nintendo and amiibo)."

3DSdeals,38udrh,Paddleson,2,Sun Jun 7 21:58:23 2015 UTC,There is a promo code given in the daily deals email that they send out and everybody gets there own code in the email so they don't get reused. You can sign up here. They probably won't send you todays ad so here's that.   The reason you are still getting charged 199.99 is because your buying it online for in store pickup. You need to actually buy it in store and you must give them a promo code to get the 10% off.

3DSdeals,37yfad,Ferneras,2,Tue Jun 2 18:26:07 2015 UTC,Thanks a bunch for sharing this! When I dropped by my local Target I noticed the game was listed for sale at $27.99. After flagging down an employee I told him I wanted to get the game but the price in the store didn't match what I had seen on their site and showed him your screenshot. Apparently it was enough for Target to honor the price.  Didn't have to jump through any hoops since it was their own site. Though I might have caught a lucky break cause it looked like some of the prices in the electronics sections weren't updated to reflect sales that had ended.
3DSdeals,37yfad,TheGenesect,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:58:56 2015 UTC,"Happy to help!  I'm glad it worked so easily for you.  I got lucky and Best Buy near me honored the picture and overrode the price.  The only downside is that it didn't stack with GCU, so it was $22.61, but hey, who can complain at that price!?  It's like 45% off!"
3DSdeals,37yfad,Ferneras,2,Wed Jun 3 18:08:19 2015 UTC,"Just got it matched at target using that picture. When they looked it up it was not in the system, but they honored it with the picture. Thanks!"
3DSdeals,37yfad,eletroguy,2,Fri Jun 5 19:57:54 2015 UTC,"The game is back up on the site as 20.99, in my local store it is 27.99. They price matched no problem and would have used the screen grab too."
3DSdeals,37yfad,drysushi,5,Sat Jun 6 20:09:55 2015 UTC,"picked up a copy about an hour ago in Newington, Connecticut. You should know at my Target it was marked 27.99 on sale and rang up that way too.  I had to go to the customer service desk so they could look it up and ""price match"" their own price.  I got it for 20.99 but it took some effort."

3DSdeals,37yfad,kevin242,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:30:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure, but the bigger problem is that it's sold out online and seems to be selling out for store pickups as well. I'm gonna have to drive ten miles out to get one tomorrow..."

3DSdeals,37qvx0,chokeslat_sauze,3,Sat May 30 06:00:11 2015 UTC,What a steal.  Anyone in Canada want to ship me one?  I'll pay a small finder's fee!

I'm gonna try the Southgate one (I'll call them first), and if that doesn't work, I may try a price match at Best Buy (I need to go there anyways) and maybe go to West Ed since I think someone told me there's some there.  For the non-Edmontonians, the thing to take from my post is the ""plenty instock"" you may hear here may not hold as true as you are told.  Edit: Reporting back. The Southgate EB seemed to have enough not to worry about it and after a call to confirm stock, I went in and grabbed it. Didn't have to go any further than that."
3DSdeals,37qvx0,tczorro,2,Fri May 29 21:45:36 2015 UTC,"Yea, I got it in the morning, and was plenty in store at that moment. Maybe they are running out of it.  P.S. I am from winnipeg."

3DSdeals,37lsph,Deadheadjustoutofbed,5,Thu May 28 15:38:54 2015 UTC,Am i crazy for wanting it cheaper?  Thinking I might just have to go used at this point.
3DSdeals,37lsph,ThaGreenRider,6,Thu May 28 19:01:24 2015 UTC,From what I can see shit doesn't get cheaper that 29.99. At least the AAA titles don't.  Hell I'm still seeing 29.99 for used DS AAA titles.

VVVVVV is a very interesting platformer.  The environments and music are really well done.  They are both really well done Indie games that pretty much everyone should play at some point if you are an indie fan at all."
3DSdeals,37hwqv,scotttech1,2,Wed May 27 23:28:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely recommend Cave Story. Such an amazing gem, and the original game was literally made by one guy and distributed as freeware. The remakes add a lot of cool features and it's worth it to support such a well polished game."

3DSdeals,37cugc,Lingo56,4,Tue May 26 22:17:47 2015 UTC,"To be honest I wasn't impressed either but bought anyway because  A)  This is the first ever deal I've seen Humble do with any console, let alone Nintendo.  I want them to keep this up.  b)  It goes to charity and independent developers.  I don't mind throwing a few bucks their way every now and then.    I paid $15 and got all the games, Moon is probably the only one I really care to play right now but hoping another surprises me.  I'll give them all a shot."
3DSdeals,37cugc,planetarial,3,Wed May 27 16:03:07 2015 UTC,Considering the usual sales Nintendo has this is a pretty big deal. I'd probably be buying more games from them if I could buy them for $7.50-$15 like most modern AAA games 2-3 years old.

3DSdeals,374n0w,tendogy,2,Mon May 25 07:03:39 2015 UTC,hows their quality of their used games? does it come with the box..? I wanna buy MM
3DSdeals,374n0w,bananaspaceman,3,Sun May 24 21:13:52 2015 UTC,"I've heard it normally comes with the box and manual in pretty good condition. I have ordered a few used DVDs from them and they always arrive in VG condition, sometimes with original inserts."
3DSdeals,374n0w,froakiefroak,2,Sun May 24 23:38:24 2015 UTC,"I ordered Etrian Odyssey 4 from them. The case is in great condition, but there were no inserts. I'd recommend them."
3DSdeals,374n0w,BobKipper,2,Mon May 25 04:56:38 2015 UTC,"I've bought 2 used games from them, Fire Emblem and Bravely Default.  Fire Emblem was sealed and even had a working club nintendo code. Seemed to be practically new.  Bravely Default was not sealed and had a save file on it. Box and game were great condition though, came with manual."
3DSdeals,374n0w,joeDUBstep,2,Mon May 25 07:20:10 2015 UTC,Just about everything I want is out of stock  Edit: Grabbed SSB Wii U for only $38 shipped. Not bad! Thanks
3DSdeals,374n0w,danetesta,1 point,Mon May 25 01:09:10 2015 UTC,"This code also applies to their books, movies, and music by the way.   Also, I'm not sure if their used games come in the original boxes or the condition of the game itself. If anyone could give some insight to their experience with buying used games here that'd be great."
3DSdeals,374n0w,shadowtact,2,Sun May 24 21:02:02 2015 UTC,"Bought a few used Wii U games from them before during a deal and the one's I got were complete in box, so at least there's a possibility."
3DSdeals,373vpp,Rapboy24,9,Sun May 24 17:09:35 2015 UTC,If there's only one or two games you want you can buy three and then return the ones you don't want. The receipt just divides the value between the 3 games rather than showing one as free. I returned two of the games I got when they had this sale last fall.

3DSdeals,373vpp,MasterOfAutisticArts,3,Sun May 24 17:32:06 2015 UTC,"That's right, but the majority people already own, but for those that don't this is a good sale"
3DSdeals,373vpp,slowro,3,Sun May 24 17:52:40 2015 UTC,"That is my problem, the only ones I don't have is Code Name S.T.E.A.M.  and Tomadachi Life. The 3rd game would have to be a game I already own, or at least a version (Pokemon X instead of Y).  I wouldn't mind owning those two. First world problems."
3DSdeals,373vpp,MasterOfAutisticArts,2,Sun May 24 18:12:07 2015 UTC,Too bad they do not have Fire Emblem Awakening on that list because that's like the only one I want to get for now
3DSdeals,373vpp,Duraz0rz,1 point,Sun May 24 18:33:25 2015 UTC,I am waiting for the sale that covers all games for the selection.

3DSdeals,373vpp,johnnystorm,2,Sun May 24 18:01:24 2015 UTC,Is this only online? Or in store too?
3DSdeals,373vpp,Squish_the_android,3,Sun May 24 18:06:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, usually when they do these types of sales it's also in store too you just have to mention it when you buy it, if your having doubts just call to the target you're going"
3DSdeals,373vpp,johnnystorm,1 point,Sun May 24 18:34:30 2015 UTC,"Well my local target didn't honor the online sale for code name steam, they told me it was separate and they didn't do online deals in store even through the sales for the rest of the games were listed. To bad I really wanted animal crossing but they didn't have it. Should've just gotten it online."

3DSdeals,373vpp,johnnystorm,2,Mon May 25 02:30:55 2015 UTC,Hmmm.. Torn between Kirby triple deluxe and Luigi's mansion dark moon. What would you guys say?
3DSdeals,373vpp,ClaidissaStar,2,Mon May 25 02:32:55 2015 UTC,They're both good. Dark Moon is harder and had better mechanics.  Also has good download play multiplayer.  I'd go with that.
3DSdeals,373vpp,johnnystorm,1 point,Mon May 25 06:28:27 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for that!"
3DSdeals,373vpp,tsumtsumtsumtsumtsum,2,Sun May 24 20:33:43 2015 UTC,"I enjoy both, but I would pick Luigi's Mansion. The gameplay is great and I find the levels more fun to replay than Kirby. Keep in mind that it is not like the original game, which was more open world. It's divided into levels for each mansion with goals for each level. I like this because I can pick it up when I've got 20 minutes to spare and feel like I accomplished something."
3DSdeals,373vpp,mando44646,1 point,Sun May 24 20:58:49 2015 UTC,Thank for the input. I feel like I'd really enjoy Kirby but after watching ign's review the graphics of Luigi's Mansion look pretty phenomenal.

3DSdeals,36q2r7,scotttech1,1 point,Thu May 21 15:45:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, I meant to imply you can pay for it now (online), but instead of delivery, opt for their ""in-store"" pickup option. They'll hold them in the store up to 8 days."
3DSdeals,36q2r7,himay81,1 point,Thu May 21 17:24:19 2015 UTC,"gotcha, will they accept canadian credit cards though?"
3DSdeals,36q2r7,scotttech1,1 point,Thu May 21 17:26:25 2015 UTC,"Hah! Now that's the real question: only at a POS terminal. You can circumvent this somewhat as indicated here, however the disclaimer also claims they don't offer it to certain countries (Canada specifically because they have stores there, I would expect).   Store pickup is not available in Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico or China.   So, the options are (a) you can try & see if they'll accept the Canadian payment source since you're obviously buying this as a gift for someone in the US, or (b) use a US-sourced card to avoid complications (as I am, being a Yankee up in your lands right now)."
3DSdeals,36q2r7,himay81,1 point,Thu May 21 17:38:52 2015 UTC,"Question: I'm definitely buying Fantasy Life, but what should the other game I get be?  FE:A isn't available from Best Buy, so that won't work."
3DSdeals,36q2r7,Ferneras,1 point,Thu May 21 13:41:53 2015 UTC,Thanks -- ends up being about 58% off total assuming 2 $40 games if you use GCU which is great.

3DSdeals,36q2r7,sujinjian,-1,Thu May 21 13:59:00 2015 UTC,I assume you have to pay full for the more expensive one and only get the 50% off for the cheaper one?
3DSdeals,36q2r7,remiarutawa,1 point,Thu May 21 11:18:11 2015 UTC,"of course, that's why deals like this always state something like ""discounted price is applied to item of least value"""

Anybody want to earn some points on their GCU card?  Edit: nevermind. Think I'm just going to bite the bullet and get the membership. 20% off new releases sounds pretty awesome.  Second edit: nevermind about the nevermind. Apparently you can't activate the membership online. I'll have to wait for them to send the card then go to a store. Unfortunately, I'm at work and going directly to the airport afterward... So won't get a chance to get over to best buy. Bleh"
3DSdeals,36q2r7,Gractious,5,Thu May 21 14:24:29 2015 UTC,"You can buy it in the store and use it immediately after. When I bought mine, I asked the cashier to do just the GCU as one transaction, then bought a few games as a second transaction to get the discount. They won't have any problem with you doing it that way.  I had a slight issue with the second transaction since it takes a moment for the system to update, so it was acting like I didn't have it. But after trying it a second time I was given the discount with no problem."

Then you'd probably enjoy Harvest Moon.    You'd be better off looking at some gameplay vids and deciding which one appeals to you the most since they're all about the same with a few differences between the games.  The Rune Factory series and Story of Seasons are also Harvest Moon games that you could check into as well."
3DSdeals,36ioob,Romiress,2,Tue May 19 22:30:33 2015 UTC,A new beginning is great. Tale of Two Towns isn't bad.  Hometown story is generally accepted to be downright terrible.
3DSdeals,36ioob,Romiress,2,Tue May 19 18:01:53 2015 UTC,Thank you for the info. I haven't played any of them yet.   Noticed the sales and thought someone might appreciate. Apologies if formatting is not good reddiquette as I am unfamiliar with posts.

3DSdeals,36ioob,Zeretha,1 point,Tue May 19 21:24:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think we'll be getting a Story of Seasons sale anytime soon. XSEED is known to rarely put their games on sale and they take pretty long to put Price Drops for their games. A New Beginning has a slow beginning, but takes off after the first season - so I wouldn't be surprised if you dropped it right before the time it gets fun. I suggest you just grab Story of Seasons instead because they made farming easier and faster along with many vast improvements in the game."

3DSdeals,36ioob,Skynetz,1 point,Wed May 20 06:47:06 2015 UTC,"No wonder I like it.  Now, ""A New Beginning"" is the most similar, but is it still also a good game? Like, is it ""the best of these three""? Or is it a good game as well?"
3DSdeals,36ioob,boredcanadian,1 point,Wed May 20 16:31:46 2015 UTC,I would say it's the second best Harvest Moon game besides Story of Seasons. And Story of Seasons is almost as good as Friend of Mineral Town

3DSdeals,35jofq,plrichard,2,Mon May 11 01:35:36 2015 UTC,Toys r us refused because we could not find the model on the fred meyer website. Called best buy for the hell of it and they said it would be fine. Just picked it up 179 after tax. They were a little hesitant to do it and it took a few minutes of them talking and checking so YMMV.

3DSdeals,35iqfs,Spade21X,4,Sun May 10 21:45:38 2015 UTC,"The game consists of you digging down further and further while coming back up to the surface to sell things you've found while digging and then using that money to upgrade your items to continue digging faster and longer.  There are also challenge rooms that you can do where you get new abilities and other rewards.  It's not exactly a platformer, though you will have to jump around your dug out path to get around.  I would say it's worth it if it sounds even slightly interesting to you.  I played it for the PC after I got it in the Humble Bundle 12, so if you bought that bundle you should already have it on the PC."

3DSdeals,35iqfs,BobKipper,1 point,Sun May 10 22:36:52 2015 UTC,"I'm confident & hopeful it will be worth the purchase.    I haven't gotten far since I bought it yesterday when I noticed the sale. I've played for close to two hours so far; running around and digging for treasure is fun. I believe they're currently in development of a turn-based RPG that's a similar art-style. If you end up enjoying this game, you might have another game to look forward to."
3DSdeals,35iqfs,oneupthespout,1 point,Sun May 10 22:56:01 2015 UTC,Not sure if you are already aware but I just found out there are 6 endings to cave story. I'm a bit behind on this game.

3DSdeals,35iqfs,skankingrove,0,Mon May 11 12:16:37 2015 UTC,"A lot of people recommend this game but I personally wouldn't. I was excited for it when it first launched but was greatly disappointed when I played through it.  Basically, you dig down in the game collecting gems and upgrades for your character that give you new abilities. The gems are used as currency to purchase items and upgrades from some NPCs above ground. The game is very very linear in that you're constantly only really digging down in search of gems and the next upgrade. Mostly you can't continue to progress without finding the upgrade and then using it to pass some obstacle that was previously impossible to traverse.  The enemies you fight in the cave are incredibly limited. There were only a handful of different monsters and each of them are pretty simple to defeat. I don't think I died once the entire time I played through it. There is only one boss, which also isn't very difficult.  It took me about 4 hours I think to completely 100% the game. To me the game has practically no replayability. Once you beat it, there isn't a harder mode to take on with new or more enemies or different upgrade paths you could try or anything like that.  My experience with this game is from right when it first launched on 3DS some time ago. I don't think there have been any updates to it since then, but if there has been then some of my post may be incorrect."

3DSdeals,34xr7b,Timobkg,4,Wed May 6 12:33:56 2015 UTC,"I sure hope so. Nintendo is the only one who doesn't give great discounts on their first party games, 30% max. On top of that the games never drop in mrp so it's 30% off of mrp instead of heavy discount on a game that has seen a normal price drop on steam/psn/xbl"
3DSdeals,34xr7b,ParthBagaria,1 point,Wed May 6 15:45:50 2015 UTC,Well they do MSRP+$10 for all of their titles so I wouldn't champion them too much.
3DSdeals,34xr7b,DevotedToNeurosis,1 point,Thu May 14 18:17:41 2015 UTC,"That honestly doesn't bother me at all.   If you're excited enough for the game to buy it on release, you're probably happy to get all the extras that come with it and don't care about paying $50 for whats effectively a limited edition.  If you're price conscious and don't mind waiting, then you know that you'll be able to pick it up for $15-30 down the line, depending on how long you want to wait."
3DSdeals,34xr7b,Timobkg,1 point,Thu May 14 18:30:51 2015 UTC,But those extras are irrelevant when the digital price is the same.
3DSdeals,34xr7b,DevotedToNeurosis,1 point,Thu May 14 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"Ah, so you want to go all digital? I try to avoid digital because of Nintendo's terrible DRM, and will pay extra for physical copies.  But assuming you want to be all digital, it again comes down to whether you're super excited and can't wait, or price conscious and can.  If you're super excited and can't wait to get it on release, it'll cost you $50, but you're so excited you don't care that you're paying $10 more.  If you're price conscious and can wait, you know that you'll be able to pick it up for $15-20 on sale, and be very glad that you're saving $10-25 compared to other publisher's games.  That seems perfectly fine to me. Have those that can't wait pay more, and pass the savings on to the patient."
3DSdeals,34xr7b,Timobkg,1 point,Thu May 14 18:53:45 2015 UTC,"I just don't agree with the higher MSRP. I mean, that's up to Atlus, and if business is working for them, sure. Personally, I don't support it."
3DSdeals,34xr7b,DevotedToNeurosis,2,Thu May 14 18:59:10 2015 UTC,"That's fair. The way I see it, being a game developer is a tough business; you do it for love, and certainly not the money.   The cost of making games is steadily increasing - gamers want better art, better voice acting, better writing, all of which requires hiring better people and directors, just as one example - while the cost has stayed relatively the same. The cost of making a 3DS game is not 2/3 the cost of making a PC/home console game, yet we expect them to cost 2/3 less to buy.  So publishers need to figure out a strategy for making money off their games given the increased production costs.   Nintendo chose to use a set price of $40, and to very rarely deviate from that price, with a good sale being $30 and rare at that. With their strategy, it doesn't matter when you buy the game, you'll be paying a lot for it. If buying digitally, you're basically looking at $40 forever.  Atlus chose to go with a higher initial price of $50, to capitalize on those who want to buy it on release, and then to decrease the price over time to $40 and $30, and having frequent sales that drop it to $20 or even $15. This is similar to the model used for PC and home consoles.  Of these two models, I prefer Atlus's, since I'm willing to wait for it to drop in price and go on sale. I've picked up all my Atlus games for $20 each, with SMT IV being the exception at $30 for the launch limited edition. If I wanted them digitally, I could have had them all for $15.  If you buy every game on release day, Atlus' model is clearly worse for you. But I argue that if you buy any game on release, price isn't a concern."

You could've also picked up Link's Awakening and Super Mario Land 2 by spending your coins from Club Nintendo last month.  Sounds like you probably didn't participate in Club Nintendo though.    I know the Mario games have been on sale a number of times, and I think Azure Striker Gunvolt was just on sale a few weeks ago, Shovel Knight dropped to $10 in January, and Ace Attorney: Dual Destines has been on sale a few times in the past few months.  Just remember most of the sales Nintendo has on the eShop are 33% off, so you won't be getting a huge savings, especially on the low price Virtual Console games."

3DSdeals,32zz6q,Nick7423,6,Sat Apr 18 04:05:51 2015 UTC,SDM employee here. Not trying to promote my own workplace but people do not take advantage of these points offers enough. On a side note: requires you to sign up for an optimum card (its a points card completely free not a credit card or anything)
3DSdeals,32zz6q,rinwashere,1 point,Sat Apr 18 04:08:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I got my Wii, xbox360, 3DSXL and PS4 (took me almost 6 months of looking) at SDM. $170 to $220 off is amazing for consoles."
3DSdeals,32zz6q,bentl3y,2,Sat Apr 18 13:22:00 2015 UTC,"I was at shoppers just yesterday and saw that the new 3ds was already on sale for 169.99 ......... so tempted even though I bought a 3ds xl in January :c hahahahaha Canada never gets these deals so I really want to take advantage of it and as I type this,  I'm slowly convincing myself to do it"
3DSdeals,32zz6q,bentl3y,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:02:17 2015 UTC,That was the normal 3DSXL :P this is still the best deal ive seen in canada if your in the market for a N3DSXL though
3DSdeals,32zz6q,bearkin1,1 point,Sat Apr 18 06:47:04 2015 UTC,"Nope, I asked to check it out and it was the new red 3ds xl. Since I did get paid yesterday, I may just go see if they still have it after work :3 There is a possibility that was the tag for the 3ds xl and they just didnt happen to have them in stock so they had the new 3ds out in it's position"
3DSdeals,32zz6q,bentl3y,1 point,Sat Apr 18 15:14:54 2015 UTC,Please let me know if it's the new one or not. If be interested.
3DSdeals,32zz6q,bearkin1,2,Sun Apr 19 02:38:31 2015 UTC,The flyer is saying it's on sale for $229.99 So I think they just filled the 3ds xl spot with a N3ds at that location :( /u/blackjpg

3DSdeals,32zz6q,whelab,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:25:42 2015 UTC,"Your link is a google search. How does this work? Is it cashback or is it instore credit? Also, another user here posted that it was on sale for $170 yesterday. Is that true?"
3DSdeals,32zz6q,rvd123123,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:22:30 2015 UTC,yeah the link to the website is down and sdm doesnt have an online catalogue. and no ive never seen the n3dsxl for 170 since we only got out shipments about 2 weeks ago. that was probably the normal 3ds xl. and its basically in store credit. HOWEVER if the merchandise is returned we give you back cash and not the credit.
3DSdeals,32zz6q,jirachipotato,1 point,Sat Apr 18 06:46:11 2015 UTC,I got mine at Shoppers too but on Senior's Day (brought my mom with me) for 20% off. I like it better than the 20x points because it was an instant discount of $51 and I don't have to worry about finding things I want to redeem for later.
3DSdeals,32m54q,zmovie,6,Tue Apr 14 22:06:20 2015 UTC,I liked Sticker Star. I would recommend you at least try the game at some point down the road. If you don't like it then oh well. Not everyone will like any given game. Cept for zelda
3DSdeals,32m54q,keichler,5,Thu Apr 16 03:54:13 2015 UTC,PSA: Sticker Star is a terrible game. Don't spend more than $5 on it -- if even that much
3DSdeals,32m54q,saifly,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:39:36 2015 UTC,"I wanted so badly to be ""charmed"" by that game but it's just awful."
3DSdeals,32m54q,Mikedx42,9,Wed Apr 15 17:47:13 2015 UTC,"Oh come on, its not that bad. The mechanics are easy to learn and it actually makes use of 3D unlike Pokemon.  For $40 I would be bummed, but honestly $40 is too much for any DS game."
3DSdeals,32m54q,ElScorp1on,-8,Wed Apr 15 21:53:56 2015 UTC,at least you know what's up. Where does nintendo get off with a $39.99 price tag for handheld games. I feel like $20 max. I can get like 8 games in a bundle on pc for $5. Mortal Kombat X $25 and that tops any nintendo game to me.
3DSdeals,32m54q,wubbzz,3,Wed Apr 15 22:07:00 2015 UTC,"$40 is really reasonable, given that that's MSRP aka the most expensive it will ever be in retail."
3DSdeals,32m54q,bugbits,-5,Thu Apr 16 00:01:46 2015 UTC,"His point is valid. $40 gets you way more playtime on PC than 3DS.  Now sure, I've gotten lots of entertainment out of big name games, (Smash, XY, FE:A) but $40 msrp makes it feel like a risk to branch out."
3DSdeals,32m54q,ElScorp1on,-2,Thu Apr 16 01:59:15 2015 UTC,"Paper Mario sticker start for 20 stills feels like wrong ,literally there's no reason to fight in the game, there's no EXP :v , and the story is..... is not bad, there's just none story at all. The only thing that still there is the Mario Party humor or a little be of it, sight i tried so hard too, but the game sucks."
3DSdeals,32m54q,pavelblink182,2,Thu Apr 16 06:58:32 2015 UTC,"You're comparing MSRP price to sale price... Obviously a humble bundle with older games is going to be cheaper.   You get Mortal Kombat X for $25? Yeah because you are using a key reseller, not exactly official channels. MSRP for Mortal Kombat X is $60."
3DSdeals,32m54q,joeDUBstep,-2,Thu Apr 16 21:43:24 2015 UTC,"Even older 3DS games aren't that cheap.. Nintendo has some die hard blinded fans, which is great for them. I'm not a MSRP consumer and i'm realizing Nintendo isn't the right gaming fit for me. I really enjoyed playing Nintendo games when I was a child and the money being spent wasn't mine and you didn't really have many options but now I see things differently. Even Shadow of Mordor with all DLC is $30. Cheaper than the ""MSRP"" of 3DS games. http://www.bundlestars.com/all-bundles/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-bundle/. It's not that old of a game.."
3DSdeals,32jymt,lukec12321,1 point,Tue Apr 14 12:04:06 2015 UTC,"EB Games has it at $57 for the time being, that is currently the cheapest price that I have come across so far."

They gave out posters and other promo items a long with the coupons. So you could still get something nice going to it even if there isn't a coupon like last time.  The one I went to in march had only 1 person there and she had limited stock because it was left overs of stuff sent to her over the last year+ for other promotional events.I don't think there is a way to know what is at any of theses till you get there

3DSdeals,320k6k,Elaboration,7,Thu Apr 9 16:55:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a lot to collect (3 hidden stars + hundreds of key chains hidden throughout each level) A bunch of pretty fun mini-games, once you beat it it unlocks dedede as a playable character... Honestly there was a ton of content."

3DSdeals,320k6k,pupunoob,2,Thu Apr 9 20:03:36 2015 UTC,Mighty Gunvolt has DLC?
3DSdeals,320k6k,chokeslat_sauze,2,Fri Apr 10 00:55:48 2015 UTC,"IGN's review of Mighty Gunvolt says, ""Presumed by some to be a piece of Azure Striker DLC, Mighty Gunvolt is actually a standalone game, albeit a tiny one."" So I think what /u/WiseSalesman was saying is, ""Mighty Gunvolt is really short without Azure Striker Gunvolt."" IGN agrees, saying, ""Now, the most important thing to know about Mighty Gunvolt is that it's woefully, incredibly short; roughly 20 minutes.""   Neither game is DLC and Azure Striker Gunvolt is the main attraction between the two. When it was released on August 29, Mighty Gunvolt was packaged with it for a limited time which is why people probably thought Mighty was DLC."
3DSdeals,320k6k,pupunoob,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:13:50 2015 UTC,I actually looked it up. There is going to be paid dlc coming for mighty gunvolt. Extra levels bosses etc.

3DSdeals,320k6k,xx9e02,3,Thu Apr 9 17:20:02 2015 UTC,"Thought it was a decent game, but felt the story mode was too easy for me (Only did all sunstones. Didn't try for all keychains). Some abilities you suck up make the mini bosses and bosses very trivial. Most puzzles aren't challenging at all, most have to do with timing. Some sunstones are hidden behind walls and gaps, so as long as you keep an eye out for them as you progress through the level you'll get all the sunstones pretty easily.

3DSdeals,31rtyl,WillieMurderface,5,Tue Apr 7 17:52:14 2015 UTC,Just scooped up a copy for the collection.  $3.24 after tax for a sealed game?  Too good to pass up.
3DSdeals,31rtyl,magikmissles,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:25:44 2015 UTC,Isn't steel diver already a free game on eshop?
3DSdeals,31rtyl,LGin732,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:40:25 2015 UTC,"That's a different Steel Diver, iirc, and it's ""free"" in the sense of being free-to-pay. After the second mission you hit a pay wall that requires paying money, or grinding the first two mind numbing missions over and over again, to proceed."
3DSdeals,31rtyl,Timobkg,-2,Tue Apr 7 20:48:44 2015 UTC,But it's worth it though.
3DSdeals,31rtyl,BKDX,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:38:26 2015 UTC,The first Steel Diver is $2.99 regular price at GameStop if that's easier to get to or you miss the sale.

3DSdeals,31pn6s,stevega71,3,Tue Apr 7 04:17:06 2015 UTC,"On the WiiU it's less a matter of broken and more a matter of glitches and load times. Going in and out of houses is a nightmare, even though it should be simple. I really like the script and the story, though, and the combat is fun.  A lot of people compare it to Earthbound but I think that's because they don't know what else to compare it to. I'd say it's almost like a separate, semi-Western take on the JRPG in a parody format. Like if someone saw Phantasy Star and said ""I could make a joke version of that.""  I think $14.99 was too steep, but ten bucks is the right price, especially considering it's a pretty long game overall."
3DSdeals,31pn6s,chainlinkspiral,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:21:26 2015 UTC,"I played it for a few hours on pc. It was fairly glitchy and broken on release. I did not enjoy my experience with it, both technically and creatively. They perhaps unwisely compared it to great and classic titles when pitching and selling themselves. Citizens of Earth is nowhere near the level of the Mother games or Suikoden."

3DSdeals,31hbps,sourpickle28,6,Sun Apr 5 02:06:45 2015 UTC,"I ordered this from amazon over a month ago. They estimated that it would ship within 2-3 weeks even with prime, then after 4 they sent me another email saying that it had been delayed by ANOTHER 4-8 weeks. So unless you really want to wait I'd look elsewhere. I live in Ontario btw"
3DSdeals,31hbps,TheTriggerMan,1 point,Sun Apr 5 06:27:09 2015 UTC,My situation (being an American) was I had my friend order it around the same time as you and also got a delay. I wanted OoT3D just to own a physical copy but I'd rather own a digital copy than have this hassle.

3DSdeals,31hbps,ko-,3,Sun Apr 5 19:56:09 2015 UTC,it's more the availability problem which makes it normally higher than MSRP.
3DSdeals,31hbps,Coraldragon,1 point,Sun Apr 5 03:31:10 2015 UTC,"idk, it said in stock on amazon CA for a long time. It's not very rare in Canada I think - just yesterday I went to my local best buy and counted 6 copies."

3DSdeals,31ca1b,Staravia,7,Fri Apr 3 22:55:33 2015 UTC,I'm glad I'm not the only one enjoying Flower Town. I think I've put in more time and effort in that game than in any of the other Streetpass Plaza games (Monster Manor comes close).
3DSdeals,31ca1b,justinhiltz,0,Sun Apr 5 08:15:55 2015 UTC,It is not at all steep. Even at $5 a piece it's a deal. How did we arrive at this place where people are unwilling to pay more than $.99 for hours of entertainment?

Mii force isn't bad  Haunted mansion is a puzzler kinda thing.  WARRIOR one is quite fun. Requires you to actually get passes to progress. And forces you to make choices

3DSdeals,319shc,tczorro,1 point,Fri Apr 3 08:27:47 2015 UTC,How's SMT? I heard the game revolves around preventing people's death and trying to escape a lockdown? Is the game scripted or do your choice's actually matter?
3DSdeals,319shc,Grifkilla51,1 point,Fri Apr 3 18:30:39 2015 UTC,there is a clock system in place. there are multiple endings depending on what you do during certain times. You can also get some characters killed.

3DSdeals,316kii,ar3n,2,Thu Apr 2 15:00:00 2015 UTC,"Nah, i see the shipping charge. Probably just going to keep my preorder at Amazon, for the $3 difference."
3DSdeals,316kii,MagicSpaceBear,2,Thu Apr 2 18:08:07 2015 UTC,I went with Newegg's.  It ended up being a little over $5 savings for me as Newegg didn't charge tax like Amazon did.

3DSdeals,31541d,rarelypost,9,Thu Apr 2 01:44:51 2015 UTC,Has this site ever not been broken all to hell? Good riddance to this crap.
3DSdeals,31541d,JM3D,3,Thu Apr 2 02:47:37 2015 UTC,"Every other time I used it, it worked fine. Right now, (if you read it) it says it's under heavy traffic. Which is pretty obvious why."
3DSdeals,31541d,FancyJesse,1 point,Thu Apr 2 15:43:51 2015 UTC,"Right, that's the irony though. It's like making a family car that can drive perfectly with just one person, but can't go past 15mph when the rest of the family gets in.  You build it expecting all those people, so why not make sure it can actually handle them?"
3DSdeals,31541d,Ugly_Muse,2,Thu Apr 2 20:21:48 2015 UTC,"You can't really compare it to that..  This program is shutting down, they are probably disconnecting their servers and only leave a certain of them on. People hear news and everyone rushes to claim their reward. A huge spike of users trying to log in, and well yeah.. you know, slow-downs and errors.   I am in noway defending them, just giving you some insight. It sucks, for all of us, but kicking Club Nintendo while they're going down seems unjust and unnecessary."
3DSdeals,31541d,FancyJesse,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:47:46 2015 UTC,Kocking them for being down every time they expect heavy traffic is reasonable. It's bad business to know waves of people are coming to your site and not prepping for it. Especially since Nintendo is known for customer service.
3DSdeals,31541d,Ugly_Muse,3,Thu Apr 2 21:08:33 2015 UTC,"Actually 90% of the time, it's fine. It's not built to handle load on days like this."
3DSdeals,31541d,skwigger,6,Thu Apr 2 15:09:36 2015 UTC,"Oh, I've got it. Anytime you might actually want to use the site, it's worthless, but whenever there's no reason to go there, you'll be just fine! Isn't that the definition of broken when it comes to a website?"
3DSdeals,31541d,zorn_,3,Thu Apr 2 16:17:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly right, and it isn't just that. First of all, half the time I get an angry Mario telling me it's ""under maintenance,"" which is flat-out not true, that's just it's crash screen. Second of all, after trying literally all day to access my reward, I'm told that I already redeemed it. I hadn't even gotten to the page. This has happened to many people, many times over.   I'm tired of people going ""Well, I had no problems, so clearly you're wrong."" That makes no sense. It's a shit website. That's all there is to it."

3DSdeals,30zo3m,Riaayo,3,Wed Apr 1 21:25:59 2015 UTC,"Guys at my Target said Best Buy will usually call them up and check if they are out of stock first, and if so it's pretty much you're SoL. Can't see why they would lie since they were out of and no longer stocked Animal Crossing, nor did any Target within several cities. They didn't have anything up I could have snagged a picture of for AC so, wasn't really any hope for me anyway.  Maybe you got lucky, or maybe sometimes employees are lazy or not lazy and the frequency with which they will actually call is different, I dunno. Still grabbed Super Mario 3D Land though and just snagged Animal Crossing elsewhere for the full I'd intended to pay several days ago anyway."
3DSdeals,30zo3m,Bmiggy17,2,Wed Apr 1 22:24:30 2015 UTC,"I think I got lucky for sure but I asked 2 workers at BB and both said it wouldn't be a problem. More than just one worker makes me think I may not have gotten lucky, but who knows?"
3DSdeals,30zo3m,JiggaMayn,2,Wed Apr 1 22:27:53 2015 UTC,"Hell maybe the Target guys just bullshitted me so they didn't have to find me some sort of promotional proof of the sale. Maybe THEY were the lazy ones.  Ah well whatever, game's fun and was worth the money."
3DSdeals,30zo3m,grundo1561,3,Wed Apr 1 22:41:24 2015 UTC,"Went to two Targets yeaterday, none which actually had any ""Sale"" signs over the listed titles. A simple price check clarified that the titles were in fact for $15.   The first store only had Mario Kart, purchased two copies (the employee explained that he wasn't technically supposed to sell multiple of the same game but he cut me a break for being very polite)  Second store had one SM3DL, two DKC, and one SMB2. Got one of each! I wanted Animal Crossing for my nephew but there was no store in the area that had any. I asked if Target employee could print me an invoice of the sale price for Animal Crossing, he did! That invoice was enough to get a price-match from BestBuy.  Good luck!"
3DSdeals,30zo3m,crankyrin,3,Thu Apr 2 15:46:32 2015 UTC,"I went to best buy today and tried to get the deal with the picture, but the salesman told me that it had to be from the official website or weekly ad. I tried pulling it up on the website but I can't seem to find the deal. Probably because this is an in-store only deal and online its listed as full price."
3DSdeals,30zo3m,grundo1561,2,Fri Apr 3 02:47:50 2015 UTC,That's the problem I was having before I went to pricematch. No online sale or weekly advertisement for whatever reason. I'm still surprised it worked for me.
3DSdeals,30zo3m,darkaxz,2,Fri Apr 3 06:44:54 2015 UTC,"It didn't work for me :(  I ended up buying NSMB2 and MK7, and left out DKC.  I'm still a little pissed though cause I would've liked to have gotten DKC, even though I have it on the Wii. Target was out, so I just took the plunge and bought them at full price."
3DSdeals,30zo3m,wubbzz,1 point,Sat Apr 4 00:53:32 2015 UTC,"I ran into a similar problem today.  I went into BB, brought SM3DL and AC to the register. Told cashier lady about the Target in-store only sale with the pictures of game+sale price. She said they needed a visible Ad. She looked for ad online... no go. This is where I succeeded. I pulled out the ultimatum! My friend next to me said ""Let's just go to the target downtown."" That's when she did a full 360 and said ""Let me see those pictures again"", i zoomed in on the DATE in the pictures.  Nothing more was said and in minutes I got my price match through.  TL;DR- Do everything you did. When your about to cave in... pull out the ""I'll go to target downtown"" card. BB will do anything to keep customer"

3DSdeals,30zo3m,whitesleeve,2,Sat Apr 4 01:36:26 2015 UTC,Sweet thanks for the info. which do you prefer Super Mario's bros 2 or super Mario 3D land ?
3DSdeals,30zo3m,YouGotAte,5,Wed Apr 1 00:34:21 2015 UTC,I've seen it brought up a lot before and it seems 90% of the time the person prefers SM3DL.
3DSdeals,30zo3m,whitesleeve,4,Wed Apr 1 00:50:48 2015 UTC,SM3DL is by far the superior game.
3DSdeals,30zo3m,Stavis,2,Wed Apr 1 04:57:50 2015 UTC,"I've only played through SM3DL twice before, never played New 2 until now."

3DSdeals,30zo3m,Stavis,2,Wed Apr 1 15:47:37 2015 UTC,"I think that if you didn't like it then, you probably wouldn't be much more interested in it now. Now you have a bit more to say about what happens in the town as far as public things like bridges are concerned, and there are more shops and such--now there's a dedicated house upgrade place, a club, a shoe store, etc.--but it's more like new DLC than a new game.  tl;dr: If you didn't like it then, you probably still won't like it now."

So I called the Best Buy that's like 5 minutes away by walk and asked on their price matching policy. I forgot what she said but I believe it was something like ""As long as you can show us the sale and where it's from we can price match it"" (don't quote me on that). I went over to BB and found the games (2 copies of ACNL left and 1 of NSMB2). Went and told her about the sale happening to the games at Target by showing her these images (http://i.imgur.com/Et7iI38.jpg & http://i.imgur.com/m0CTY4a.jpg - these were saved on my phone to make it look like I took the photos) and she gladly price matched them.

What I'd do is either buy codes off of ebay with the money you will save on the games or go into your local GameStop on the 31st and see if they would mind you looking through the used game cases for codes. Not my favorite way of doing it, personally, but at least no one would be looking for them anymore if you went late in the day."

3DSdeals,30nyq3,xcleex,8,Sun Mar 29 02:57:49 2015 UTC,Corporate policy states they should price match their own website. I work in electronics at my local Wal-Mart and my management has nearly no choice but to honor the policy when I'm working because I know better than most other associates.

3DSdeals,30nyq3,father_cube,2,Sun Mar 29 03:48:10 2015 UTC,The specific store policy is set by the store manager. I have two Walmarts both about ten minutes from me in different directions. One will match and the other wont. This is what the one that won't price match told me.
3DSdeals,30nyq3,L810C,1 point,Sun Mar 29 05:23:26 2015 UTC,Wow... so I guess it all depends on the store and the manager's policy. It was surprising for them to deny price match their own website and there's Bestbuy right next to them as well.
3DSdeals,30nyq3,JoeHigashi2000,5,Sun Mar 29 16:33:27 2015 UTC,just show them this.  http://corporate.walmart.com/policies/our-online-price-match-policy   The following are guidelines and limitations:  The prices on Walmart.com and online retailers* will be matched

3DSdeals,30nyq3,taleasaur,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:48:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely false information, their Ad-Match policy updated sometime last year and incorporated ad-matching for most online retailers, including their own website Wal-Mart.com.   Your best bet in getting the item price matched would to be call 1-800-WAL-MART and file a complaint and tell them the store number and give them a description and ask why the store is not following current ad matching policy. Their managers always follow up with complaints made to corporate with a call back to your phone number, so hopefully you'll get some feedback soon.  Pick up today orders are usually on a slight delay, as they have to be communicated to a handheld unit and manually picked from a shelf and binned in to a separate bin for online orders; the only reason they wouldn't be able to finish getting the item today would be constraints with employment, i.e no one working in the site to store department that day or lack of inventory."

3DSdeals,30leaf,FrostedSmoothie,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:12:20 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, you'll pretty much be buying from The Game Collection, so have a look on their site for international shipping stuff. I've bought from them before in the UK and had no problems."
3DSdeals,30leaf,LGin732,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:16:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for the find! Was too good not to buy :D
3DSdeals,30leaf,Skywise87,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:23:51 2015 UTC,is there a link for this? i'm not sure if I can order to the US

3DSdeals,30jk1p,watMartin,1 point,Sat Mar 28 12:37:43 2015 UTC,I noticed but oh well.
3DSdeals,30jk1p,kosanovskiy,1 point,Sat Mar 28 02:03:59 2015 UTC,Since Kid Icarus and Star Fox 64 3D are on Club Nintendo you can grab some cheap codes on ebay from people who just wan to sell it. i got it for around $25. probably comparable with the exchange rate.
3DSdeals,30jk1p,illossolli,1 point,Sat Mar 28 12:01:57 2015 UTC,Nice ill look for the it around. Kind of sucks how I had chances to buy them cheap while back and just didn't.

3DSdeals,30f6kr,Devils_halo2k,3,Thu Mar 26 21:42:46 2015 UTC,Its USA only. If you ship it to Canada its the same cost a just buying the $22 one with free shipping from amazon.ca
3DSdeals,30f6kr,Devils_halo2k,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:59:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for clearing that up.
3DSdeals,30f6kr,zzAlan,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:01:42 2015 UTC,We have the SDXC UHS/3 one here on sale for 25$  I'm tempted. I shouldn't. But I am very tempted
3DSdeals,30f6kr,Devils_halo2k,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:01:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't like this deal at first since the cost of the card is double that of the shipping cost, but if you get it with something else like I did, for example EOU which has also dropped in price along with the card or anything to get the purchase above $35, you end up saving like 8USD on shipping costs."
3DSdeals,30f6kr,kaztrator,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:32:17 2015 UTC,"yeah, i try to keep an eye out locally, just due to shipping."
3DSdeals,30f6kr,bugbits,1 point,Fri Mar 27 00:19:30 2015 UTC,Just a reminder that SDXC cards don't work with the new 3ds xl.
3DSdeals,30f6kr,hoowahman,1 point,Fri Mar 27 06:17:21 2015 UTC,Oh? Hmmm.
3DSdeals,30f6kr,juaquin,1 point,Fri Mar 27 07:30:57 2015 UTC,"Actually, they are (not that you should get one anyway for your 3ds). It's just the required partition format that you need to use with SDXC to make full use of the card and not the card itself which is why you're better off with SDHC until they do a firmware update to add support for a larger format. Till then, 64GB users are stuck with a 'glass half full' card unless they don't mind what their risking and in spite of this, don't run into any problems. There are people who have no issues with 64GB and those that do.  Initially had second thoughts about getting the 64GB instead. 32Gb or rather, 29GB (roughly 230,000 blocks) seems sufficient for currently available games and felt 64Gb to be a little overkill (unless you download most if not all purchases then you can never have enough memory). After buying one, I found moving 3DS files around on an SD card surprisingly simple than what it's normally made out to be.   Just a reminder that SDXC cards don't work with the new 3ds xl.   It's always good to point this out as much as possible because not many people know what SDHC and SHXC is. I personally saw it as jargon for a tech literate individual till someone pointed it out."
3DSdeals,30e6dz,mejjos,3,Thu Mar 26 17:30:18 2015 UTC,Holy shit thank you very much I've been dying for something like this.
3DSdeals,30e6dz,ClawofBeta,2,Thu Mar 26 18:07:26 2015 UTC,So it's like getting the console for $180
3DSdeals,30e6dz,bugbits,3,Thu Mar 26 18:17:47 2015 UTC,Or 10 dollars off each. Hey!
3DSdeals,30e6dz,AdamManHello,4,Thu Mar 26 20:51:27 2015 UTC,Console = $200  Game = $40  Bundle = $220  Unbundled price ($240) - Bundled Price ($220) = Savings ($20)  Items in bundle = 2  2 / $20 = $10  $10 off each.
3DSdeals,30e6dz,AdamManHello,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:04:11 2015 UTC,only $8 saved after tax :/
3DSdeals,30e6dz,ocazz,2,Thu Mar 26 21:16:12 2015 UTC,Starting to be less mad I missed the limited local restock of the mmn3dsxl yesterday thanks for this!
3DSdeals,30e6dz,Roalith,2,Thu Mar 26 21:22:09 2015 UTC,Is it possible to price match with target? I'm not near a Walmart.
3DSdeals,30e6dz,cados,1 point,Sat Mar 28 03:47:37 2015 UTC,"Found out that it does not, since walmart's sale is considered a bundle deal.  Guess I'll be paying full price."
3DSdeals,30e6dz,cados,3,Thu Mar 26 18:20:41 2015 UTC,"Walmart stores won't even consider a price match on their own bundle. I tried to do this in two different Walmart stores and both of them refused to do this. Both console and the game I wanted were there, but they basically said ""if it's an online bundle, we can't do anything about it."" From a customer point of view, this is really dumb.. I ended up not buying and probably won't bother buying the bundle online."
3DSdeals,30e6dz,KucingBongsor,1 point,Fri Mar 27 06:06:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah this literally just happened to me today. And now I have the exact same feelings as you haha. I'm not gonna buy it anymore lol, it's so dumb."

3DSdeals,30e6dz,wRolf,1 point,Sat Mar 28 22:09:45 2015 UTC,Does anyone know how long this deal will be up?
3DSdeals,30e6dz,jewpoosrewyou,1 point,Sat Apr 4 00:47:43 2015 UTC,Can you get this deal in store or online only?
3DSdeals,30e6dz,ZillerMach,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:51:24 2015 UTC,I keep telling myself to hold out for the regular sized or a sale.. it's getting harder and harder :(

3DSdeals,30efuw,mejjos,2,Thu Mar 26 18:35:17 2015 UTC,"Says its out of stock now, oddly. Even though everything in the bundle can easily be picked up at your local walmart, I'm sure."
3DSdeals,30efuw,S13eric,1 point,Sun Mar 29 02:28:34 2015 UTC,I thought the newer generations of Hawaiians and others who want them.
3DSdeals,30efuw,fernando_69,1 point,Fri Apr 10 10:10:47 2015 UTC,"Basically an amiibo is $1, this is only a dollar more than the deal with a game bundled."
3DSdeals,30em1g,joeDUBstep,5,Thu Mar 26 19:18:54 2015 UTC,"400DYR2. That's my online code. I think you could use it more than once. I entered it again and it looked fine on the website. Never checked out, but give it a shot!"
3DSdeals,30em1g,diesol,3,Thu Mar 26 22:02:23 2015 UTC,400DYR2   This codes works. Wish i had it sooner since they had MM and now it's sold out. Thanks though!
3DSdeals,30em1g,fsshariq,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:27:56 2015 UTC,I was going to get that but bit the bullet on Smash Bros

3DSdeals,30em1g,myneighborpatoriku,1 point,Fri Mar 27 05:44:13 2015 UTC,Same. I tried using the codes last night but they didn't work. Been trying to get my hands on Bowsers Inside Story so if anyone else has another code I would greatly appreciate it!
3DSdeals,30em1g,fsshariq,1 point,Fri Mar 27 14:14:12 2015 UTC,nice! would love to snag a game or two if i had the coupon :/

3DSdeals,30em1g,ShureNensei,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:15:51 2015 UTC,400DYR2 should work. Apparently we can use the codes more than once.
3DSdeals,30em1g,ShureNensei,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:41:25 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind you may get a Malaysian version from them for used games.  I bought FE:A and it said Saudi Arabia/Malaysia/Singapore on the cover art; I knew that there was a chance for that going in due to other similar comments though, and it works for NA region anyway.  The only difference is a little circle on the cover art and it doesn't come with a Club Nintendo code.  The cartridge and manual are the same as NA version.  Mine was shrink-wrapped and new."
3DSdeals,30em1g,diesol,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:13:23 2015 UTC,"Good to know.  I also got FE:A but it was the American version, or at least it didn't indicate any region. I was actually half-expecting a malaysian version since I remember seeing someone post it in the last thread.  But hey, as long as it works right?"
3DSdeals,30em1g,diesol,2,Thu Mar 26 21:19:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the deal was good enough ($25) to where it didn't really bother me much at all, not to mention I wasn't expecting it to be new."
3DSdeals,30em1g,Futant55,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:24:11 2015 UTC,Quick question. Why do some games not come with a club nintendo code?
3DSdeals,30em1g,diesol,2,Thu Mar 26 21:14:14 2015 UTC,"Depends.  If it's used, someone already jacked it.  If it's new, either it's too new of a game (nintendo stopped putting the codes in some of the latest releases), or someone jacked it."
3DSdeals,30em1g,Futant55,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:17:50 2015 UTC,Lame. I have the email as well. A day after the previous sale but it's in store only. Anybody want my barcode?
3DSdeals,30em1g,yoyong1995,2,Thu Mar 26 21:20:05 2015 UTC,I'll take the barcode. I'll stop in hastings tomorrow when i get paid and see what my local store has.
3DSdeals,30em1g,Sorcci,1 point,Fri Mar 27 01:39:14 2015 UTC,"You sure? Mine had a barcode on the left, and an online code in pretty small text to the right of it."
3DSdeals,30em1g,yoyong1995,2,Thu Mar 26 21:22:01 2015 UTC,Found it. I kept clicking the wrong link lol

3DSdeals,30em1g,Rapboy24,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:46:46 2015 UTC,Then they lied to me! or someone already used it :p
3DSdeals,30em1g,danielvdell,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:39:33 2015 UTC,Being able to buy MM for $27 is a steal taking in mind that most of the traded in versions of this game are practically new since it is a recent game!
3DSdeals,30b9vc,9753157,2,Wed Mar 25 23:38:01 2015 UTC,They sell pre-owned amiibos at a few of my local gamestops. They are usually hanging behind the counter.
3DSdeals,30b9vc,gbrenik,2,Thu Mar 26 00:37:54 2015 UTC,"oh cool, so I guess either they don't list them on the site or I'm dumb as a post and didn't search correctly."
3DSdeals,30b9vc,gbrenik,2,Thu Mar 26 00:46:29 2015 UTC,"I think it's a pretty recent thing and I hadn't seen it on their site before - I actually asked the guy at the store about it today because I was surprised myself, so it's worth a post.   Really it's not much more of a discount than you could get at Best Buy with gamer's club, except at Best Buy you get it new. I think it comes out to $11 used and $10 for pro members if I remember right."
3DSdeals,30b9vc,Zeretha,1 point,Thu Mar 26 00:56:08 2015 UTC,"4 Amiibos for $20 is pretty decent assuming they have 4 you want.  Probably a big if though I suppose, considering its very likely to  be all commons"
3DSdeals,30b9vc,gbrenik,-2,Thu Mar 26 02:47:41 2015 UTC,"Do you mean 2 for $20? Or do you have some special buy 1 get 1 free coupon, in which case could you please share? :P"
3DSdeals,30b9vc,Zeretha,3,Thu Mar 26 02:50:19 2015 UTC,This deal is B2G2 which would be 4 for $20 :p assuming your location has pre-owned Amiibos
3DSdeals,30b9vc,gbrenik,-2,Thu Mar 26 02:52:34 2015 UTC,"ohhhhh wow I totally missed that, I thought this was just about the amiibos being available pre-owned. Darn, I should have grabbed some - they had a good amount at my local gamestop."
3DSdeals,30b9vc,Zeretha,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:53:58 2015 UTC,Should still be there tomorrow unless you already went and bought some from BB.
3DSdeals,30b9vc,gbrenik,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:55:48 2015 UTC,Any word on how long this sale goes for? Can't find an expiration date.
3DSdeals,30b9vc,Zeretha,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:00:22 2015 UTC,Finally found it.  3/23 - 4/5.  Got a bit of time to get there then
3DSdeals,30b9vc,Zeretha,2,Thu Mar 26 03:05:28 2015 UTC,Think I'll check out my store tomorrow to see if they have pre-owned Amiibos now.  Have kind of wanted Pikachu and Kirby so I guess getting two more free commons with those would be nice.
3DSdeals,30b9vc,mando44646,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:58:21 2015 UTC,Hope you find some good amiibos
3DSdeals,30260f,dr3amsINdigital,3,Mon Mar 23 21:38:04 2015 UTC,what can you really get with that gift card though?
3DSdeals,30260f,iCue713,2,Mon Mar 23 23:14:04 2015 UTC,"You can use it towards anything, but note that it does expire within a few months. They do sell 3DS games."
3DSdeals,30260f,iCue713,2,Mon Mar 23 23:20:18 2015 UTC,wow didn't know they sold 3DS games haha thanks
3DSdeals,30260f,ignition386,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:32:51 2015 UTC,"You can put it towards anything on the Dell site, including other games.  Dell's MM3DS preorder also included a $25 gift card. I used that to pick up Kirby Triple Deluxe for $5 shipped (although it looks like they've raised the price since then, probably since it was a popular choice for GC redemption)."
3DSdeals,30260f,iCue713,2,Mon Mar 23 23:20:50 2015 UTC,thanks didn't know they sold games on their site!

3DSdeals,30260f,MagicSpaceBear,2,Tue Mar 24 01:01:55 2015 UTC,You might have to switch to the old style website if it gives you the option. It also doesn't show on the mobile site. It should show up when you add to cart.
3DSdeals,30260f,timrbrady,2,Tue Mar 24 01:07:49 2015 UTC,"Ok I loaded the full website and, you're right, it doesn't load in mobile.  Full site shows the promo and the card in shopping cart.  I have the stupids...."
3DSdeals,300uzj,mejjos,2,Mon Mar 23 16:04:12 2015 UTC,Definitely going to pick up SMT at that price!
3DSdeals,300uzj,SirSmokesAlott,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:44:20 2015 UTC,Is it worth getting if you never played a game in that series before? I'm thinking of buying it too. Is it hard to get into for new players?

3DSdeals,300uzj,SirSmokesAlott,1 point,Tue Mar 24 06:45:24 2015 UTC,You definitely don't need any prior knowledge about the series but this game is hard. You can die on the tutorial
3DSdeals,300uzj,VritraReiRei,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:35:32 2015 UTC,"So do you think it's worth it?is it fun hard or frustrating ""cheap"" hard?"
3DSdeals,300uzj,SirSmokesAlott,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:31:01 2015 UTC,"Not like super meat boy hard, but like, enemies deal a lot of of damage compared to yours. you know how when you start a game for the first time you are given the option to select easy, normal, or hard difficulty? Well you chose hard. I really can't think of a better way to explain it.  If you never played an RPG before, you might have a hard time."
3DSdeals,300uzj,jprs22,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:54:00 2015 UTC,I've played final fantasy and a little known Japanese ps1 game called monster seed that's about it =/ but I do want to get into these kind of games. I just recently got 3ds so I am gonna buy fire emblem awakening and bravely default. I guess I'll just pick it up though at this price and if it's too hard I'll go back to it after a while or I might just stick it out =D  Thanks for reply.
3DSdeals,300uzj,SirSmokesAlott,2,Wed Mar 25 20:41:30 2015 UTC,Shin Megami Tensei IV is definitely worth picking up!

3DSdeals,2zx0f7,tubetalkerx,2,Sun Mar 22 16:50:11 2015 UTC,This game must be selling terribly. I thought Amazon's $35 was good for a new Nintendo game but $30 is getting down there.

3DSdeals,2zzdel,Skywise87,3,Mon Mar 23 05:03:10 2015 UTC,Sell it on eBay?
3DSdeals,2zzdel,Theprofessor1000,3,Mon Mar 23 13:52:45 2015 UTC,Walmart will do equivalent exchange with no receipt. You can also get a gift card instead.
3DSdeals,2zzdel,espresso9,2,Mon Mar 23 05:13:50 2015 UTC,"Some places like Target will take any item they sell on the shelves for the lowest price they've sold it for in the past few weeks. I.E. If they had it on sale for $5 a week ago they will only pay $5 for it if you do not have a receipt.  IIRC gamestop will not accept new, unopened games (at least that was the deal at the local shop about a year ago). If they do I'm sure you would not get much back.  Your other options are places like /r/gameswap where you can trade it for something you'd like to keep."

3DSdeals,2zzdel,Squish_the_android,1 point,Mon Mar 23 06:02:52 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say its immoral. It might be if he was buying at one store and returning at another for a profit. Or he might be like me and have received a game he already owned as a gift and just wants to return it for some kind of credit.
3DSdeals,2zzdel,dr3amsINdigital,-3,Mon Mar 23 12:50:20 2015 UTC,That's what's being asked here. Trying to return something to a store where the original transaction didn't take place is immoral.
3DSdeals,2zzdel,joeDUBstep,0,Mon Mar 23 16:46:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think the word ""immoral"" is quite the correct word to use, as it is a highly subjective word. One could argue that it's actually moral to do this because you are ""ripping off"" big corporations like Walmart who rely on products being sourced form sweatshop labor.   Is it dishonest? Yes. Is it a fiscally intelligent move? Yes. Is it immoral? maybe."
3DSdeals,2zzdel,xiixxkingxxiix,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:07:32 2015 UTC,Agreed. I feel like game stop is more of the immoral one. But I don't think walmart and it's big pockets will mind.
3DSdeals,2zzdel,joeDUBstep,1 point,Mon Mar 23 19:52:57 2015 UTC,"Even then, one could justify it for gamestop (not saying I personally do), their trade-in policy is borderline robbery.  Week old title? You get $20-25, and they resell it for 37.99 or something pretty close to new price."
3DSdeals,2zzdel,xiixxkingxxiix,0,Mon Mar 23 20:48:09 2015 UTC,Better than getting 1.47 at gamestop. Besides walmart is a huge store they will not look at the loss of 20$
3DSdeals,2zzdel,dr3amsINdigital,0,Mon Mar 23 13:34:30 2015 UTC,Whether the store will take a hit or not is besides the point. It's still immoral to return something to a store you didn't buy it from.

3DSdeals,2zdkjf,PriceZombie,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:06:36 2015 UTC,"The Amazon api only reports a unique pair of price + price type. Meaning I know what Amazon sells the item for, and what a 3rd party sells it for. I don't get to pick which 3rd party seller, or even know who the seller is. The going rate is based on who the lowest priced seller is. If that seller sells out of inventory or increases the price, then the next lowest priced seller becomes the going rate - not unlike the price of a stock on the stock market.  If you think about it, it doesn't really matter who the seller is. Any amazon new item and FBA item have their inventories mixed. So its coming from the same bag either way."
3DSdeals,2zdkjf,freypod007,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:22:15 2015 UTC,The reason I ask is I set up a watch list. I just got notified an item was list at the price I listed. I was hoping to figure out who the seller is so I could buy it for the lowest price.
3DSdeals,2zdkjf,PriceZombie,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:31:31 2015 UTC,"ahh. The buy link (if it was for a 3rd party) should lead you to the 3rd party sellers list. Amazon doesn't include shipping prices in their feed, so the lowest priced seller isn't always the cheapest seller since the seller could have a have a jacked up shipping cost. Sometimes you get lucky and it's FBA. Always luck of the draw with 3rd party listings.  Listing shipping price would be the first thing I'd like to see changed with the API.  edit: If you're interested in learning how price tracking works, I wrote a post a few days ago that goes into some detail. It might help complete the picture."

3DSdeals,2za8xm,jyang80,2,Tue Mar 17 06:23:57 2015 UTC,"SMT IV is well worth the money. Devil Summoner Soul Hackers is good too, but it's a very difficult game unless you turn the difficulty down. Also it's just a port of a Sega Saturn game, and can be a bit buggy."
3DSdeals,2za8xm,Timobkg,2,Tue Mar 17 06:50:45 2015 UTC,"SMT IV and Etrian Odyssey IV are my two top picks of this sale, and also two of the best RPGs for the system."
3DSdeals,2za8xm,trulyfascinating,2,Wed Mar 18 14:56:31 2015 UTC,"Everyone needs to get SMTIV. This is the only game that has kept me from playing FE:A for a long period of time, and I know I've barely scratched the surface even 20+ hours in. It's my first entry in the Megaten universe, and I absolutely love it."
3DSdeals,2za8xm,ryfee,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:55:34 2015 UTC,I will get it for my next game for sure! (Or Bravely Default.) I'm playing FE:A atm and I can see myself playing this for a longgg time... It probably doesn't help that I'm fond of the characters even though I'm only at chapter 8.
3DSdeals,2za8xm,DaxterAttano,3,Wed Mar 18 20:51:43 2015 UTC,Why Atlus? I really want physical copies of these games but the sales are too good.
3DSdeals,2za8xm,Timobkg,3,Tue Mar 17 06:26:50 2015 UTC,"I've picked up most of their games for $20 off Amazon. Not quite as cheap as these sales, but I'll gladly pay $5 more for a physical copy I can share with my family."

3DSdeals,2za8xm,ArchangelPT,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:58:46 2015 UTC,About 3Gb which is huge for a 3DS game

3DSdeals,2za8xm,Brlghtslde,8,Mon Mar 16 23:35:46 2015 UTC,SMT IV is by far the better game.
3DSdeals,2za8xm,ooglygooglypants,7,Mon Mar 16 23:52:15 2015 UTC,"SMT4 is said to be one of the best JRPGs on the system. Conception II had a demo, not terribly good from what I hear."
3DSdeals,2za8xm,Zeretha,3,Mon Mar 16 23:53:29 2015 UTC,SMT IV is a better game.  Got both for $20 and Conception is alright but SMT IV is one of my favorite RPGs on the system.

I wouldn't expect Picross to get any sales any time soon, but you never can tell with the eShop.  If you really want a Picross game, you can either get the DS one like Presto99 suggests or just pick up one every now and then at full price while waiting on a sale.  You could also search for nonogram apps to play on your phone or tablet.  The Picross series isn't the only game around involving nonograms that you could play while waiting on an eShop Picross sale."

3DSdeals,2zb4hb,rarelypost,2,Tue Mar 17 03:18:32 2015 UTC,"A 3DS XL won't be $200 now that the New 3DS XL has been released at the $200 price point.  Unless of course you were wanting the New 3DS XL, which probably won't be getting too many sales in the next few months since it just released last month.  You could look into the 2DS if price is an issue and you don't want to buy a used system since they retail for $80-$100, depending on if you find one on sale.  Animal Crossing: New Leaf was around the $20-$25 area for a while at all the retail stores and just went back up to $30 recently.  Your best bet will be either eBay or waiting for a sale on that one."

3DSdeals,2yya59,teleporterdown,1 point,Sat Mar 14 09:06:11 2015 UTC,"I had a chance to play this at pax. Let me tell you, any advice saying to check out the mobile game will not do this justice! This games comes with 2 games: Puzzle & Dragons Z, and P&D SMB. P&D Z is a straight up jrpg with the battle system being a tile swap match 3 (you slide tiles around the board to manipulate positions of pieces. You don't just swap 2 tiles at a time). In P&D Z, you have a character which you control, NPCs which you talk to and can collect quests from, and dungeons to do your questing. It looks awesome. None of those elements I listed are in the mobile version (except the dungeons) . Also, there is a lot more animations and the graphics are superbly better.   In P&D SMB version, you don't get to move Mario around town and collect quests like in Z. Instead, you move mario from level to level like in Super Mario World then enter a side scrolling level. Mario moves from left to right and when you encounter an enemy, you play he classic P&D tile swapping battles. Tiles have been changed to be more ""mushroom Kingdom esq"".   I love puzzle rpg hybrids and if you are the least bit interested, I would definitely recommend trying these games out. And also, unlike the mobile game, there are no micro transactions."

You can't find the game cheaper anywhere else, the going rate for a used copy is more on eBay (around £20 or so with P&P) & it retails at around the £30 mark from what I can see.

I try to only post deals that are clearly a good discount, but the reception has often been lukewarm.

3DSdeals,2yse0l,Hammertoss,1 point,Thu Mar 12 12:38:21 2015 UTC,SMT4 is the only game in the series I've played. How does this one compare?
3DSdeals,2yse0l,Rew4Star,2,Thu Mar 12 19:01:21 2015 UTC,"I'd play Overclocked first, for starters."
3DSdeals,2yse0l,Timobkg,1 point,Fri Mar 13 12:40:05 2015 UTC,"It's more of a strategy RPG.   The combat takes place on a grid, FF Tactics style, but still employs similar combat mechanics such as the Push Turn system.   There's more story, which takes place as visual novel style conversations.  There's still demon summoning and fusion, but there's no 3rd person dungeon exploration.  This is also the sequel to Devil Survivor Overclocked, and is directly related to it, unlike the standalone nature of the main SMT games, so I would play Overclocked first."
3DSdeals,2yrsq8,Warruzz,7,Thu Mar 12 07:08:41 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who finds it funny that boxeddeal.com is selling digital codes?

3DSdeals,2yrsq8,nawk101,5,Thu Mar 12 17:31:13 2015 UTC,Is yoshis island worth it though?
3DSdeals,2yrsq8,froakiefroak,7,Thu Mar 12 07:10:08 2015 UTC,"I thought it was pretty fun, yeah. I hear a lot of people not liking it but honestly I had a good time playing it."

3DSdeals,2yrsq8,popnbrown,1 point,Fri Mar 13 01:24:25 2015 UTC,Physical copies are never price matched with digital copies.
3DSdeals,2yrsq8,Zeretha,1 point,Sat Mar 14 03:01:32 2015 UTC,They didn't price match download code from bestbuy.com either. The problem was that they weren't going to price match boxeddeal.com it's not in their list of retailers they match.
3DSdeals,2yrsq8,Warruzz,1 point,Sat Mar 14 12:49:21 2015 UTC,"So for this one they are actually shipping you a code, not just emailing it to you after purchase, correct?"
3DSdeals,2yrsq8,WillieMurderface,2,Thu Mar 12 14:56:40 2015 UTC,"It says      ""Fast Email email Delivery"" so I would assume only email"

3DSdeals,2yrsq8,NariandColds,1 point,Sat Mar 14 22:16:12 2015 UTC,"For anyone thinking about buying this game, you should. If you enjoyed the original Yoshi's Island then this doesn't ruin the experience in any way, probably even adds a few more things you can do (transformations, egg size, etc). It's fun, and for the price you can't really go wrong."
3DSdeals,2yrsq8,popnbrown,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:41:04 2015 UTC,I was more curious abo uh t actually walking in store and showing the deal see if they'd match it. I'm at work so can't try that right now

3DSdeals,2ygimk,Romiress,2,Mon Mar 9 17:08:30 2015 UTC,"Check the GameStop website. Search for the game in your zip, then city, then state. If you see it pop up, even in another city, call your local GS and see if they will ship it from the store that has it to your store. When it gets to your store, they will call you, and you pay for it when they hand it to you. If you're a Pro member, it's $45 plus tax, if you aren't it's $50 plus tax."
3DSdeals,2ygimk,Norviskor,1 point,Mon Mar 9 17:09:42 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer if you want the physical cart. As OP mentioned, they're going for $70 minimum on eBay and Amazon. $45 at Gamestop is definitely the cheapest you'll find it."

Just saying, Majora's really brought up the price because so many people who didn't get around to OoT3D on release wanted to play it in anticipation, so demand overshadowed supply. It'll always be sought after, just not in the same way that it is when the sequel is announced."

A mail forwarding service might be cheaper than buying it in the US but I can't be sure. Here is the Amazon Canada link.

If you want boxed copy be prepared to fork over $100 and maybe lots more if you want 100% US version and depending on how long you wait. I have 2 sealed copies and I wouldn't sell it to you for anything less than $150.  You snooze u lose!

I bought Fire Emblem Awakening from GoHastings.com around Valentine's Day because they had 35% off on all used video games. I received the game of the same name...but wrong region. Pic Fortunately, they took responsibility and gave me my full refund, so it wasn't all bad. If you do receive something damaged or the wrong item (which was the case with me), just make sure to state your reason for return clearly and attach it to the packing slip."

3DSdeals,2y92pm,MolaMolaphant,1 point,Sun Mar 8 02:04:04 2015 UTC,"Yup, everything was in order. They said nothing about the code, so I figured even if it showed up it might still be used, so was pleasantly surprised when one of them was valid.

I really wanted to though.  You jump with Up+Circle Pad/Control Pad and grind with Down+Circle Pad/Control Pad, jump to end it.  Do different tricks with Circle Pad/Control Pad directions, like left, 180 to the right, and so on. I'm finding it hard to do other tricks, so I'm just doing ollies (Up+Circle Pad/Control D) and grinds and that's no fun :(  You also can't do trick after trick, you do one until you land. And I naturally press down on the circle pad to go straight down, but that's for grinds, so I lose points.  Edit: Use the Control Pad if you find the Circle Pad controls hard, much better 👍"

I honestly found it super bland and lifeless.  Areas are sparsely populated and every time you do something youre just not really sure if you care or not.  Game just isnt that compelling to be honest."

You switch cubes in between the background and foreground (taking advantage of the 3D effect) to solve puzzles and create platforms while shooting enemies. The levels and puzzles are well designed to me. There's also a timer on stages that records how fast you beat the level so you can go back and beat best times. This isn't required though, just adds replay value. It depends on how much you enjoy the puzzle mechanic.  I can't vouch for 2 as I haven't played it yet but I'm getting it with this sale!"

The first one got 19 comments. Three of the top level comments were comments on the thread itself, one was a question, one was a buzzsteal, and three were actual deal lists/ask for my referral.  The second one got 12. It was by far the most productive - a few UK deals, one super mega sketchy ""cdkeys"" one, and a tip about club nintendo closures.  The third one, last week, had literally one comment and it was downvoted to hell because it didn't take shipping into account.  We'll see if this one is any better, but right now it seems like the subreddit would be better off with these deals returning to the main subreddit with TOM deals limited in some way.

3DSdeals,2xkz4f,dee7291,0,Wed Mar 4 04:02:14 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if they'll take it since you can't exactly buy it off the website. It just shows an advertisement that's not a local store. I'll give it a try later tonight though.
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,charleshk,4,Wed Mar 4 04:16:35 2015 UTC,Whoo! I had to tell them that fredmeyer works since it's not very well known! 20$ back here I come :)   Thanks for the link! Saved me a good chunk of money!
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,Throwawaywork321,5,Sun Mar 1 21:30:13 2015 UTC,FYI Best buy price matched this also or will find out in store. Called and fredmeyer is on the price match list. It may vary between stores/employees. Mine did it with no problems.
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,Throwawaywork321,2,Sun Mar 1 21:40:22 2015 UTC,I would try another Best Buy. If not I would try Walmart and speak to a manager. I heard you get better results and also you can tell them that Kroger owns FredMeyers which also owns frys and other grocery stores.
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,kssyu,1 point,Mon Mar 2 00:28:10 2015 UTC,"If you don't have a local Fred Meyer, there's not much you can do. They only price match certain websites, but that doesn't include Fred Meyer, and local competitors.   I would try Toys R Us. They normally would price match Fred Meyer website unless they argue that you need to be able to order it online (and not in-store exclusive)."
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,RedditsApprentice,2,Tue Mar 3 01:43:14 2015 UTC,"Did you call your local Best Buy or the online store's number?   I called the number the website tells you to call to price match, they directed to me to another person, who directed me to my local store, who told me they only price match if the store is a local one.   I don't have a local Fred Meyer ):"
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,ShureNensei,1 point,Tue Mar 3 01:59:24 2015 UTC,They should have online-based pricematching and not have to direct you to anyone locally unless something changed within the past month or two.  Sounds like the reps you spoke to were either confused or not trained well.  I would probably call again.
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,sendingsignal,2,Tue Mar 3 03:57:15 2015 UTC,"I definitely had best buy on the phone (bestbuy.com) give me gcu discount /and/ pricematch, which they aren't supposed to do, but honestly any time like this I'd just keep calling until someone gives you what you want, because obviously they can make their own call on it and they have huge call centers.   I'm gonna try on tuesday."
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,ShureNensei,1 point,Mon Mar 2 01:16:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's silly, but I've literally called back after a failed attempt a long time ago and got two completely different people in terms of friendliness.  It was for a MK7 deal and I was actually able to get 2 copies -- I made sure to give that guy a glowing survey.  The only real drawback is that it could eat up your time trying."
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,Throwawaywork321,1 point,Mon Mar 2 05:28:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry. I called local best buy and they priced matched it even if we do not have a Fred Meyers since they are owned by Kroger and Kroger owns frys, and other grocery stores.   Might vary between stores."
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,RedditsApprentice,2,Mon Mar 2 05:30:20 2015 UTC,"I tried calling again. No go. They didn't transfer me but essentially told me the same thing. Said that because Fred Meyer's is a brick and mortar store and not a major retailer, I'd have to have one within a 25 mile radius of my house in order to be able to price match. I was hoping to play it soon on my first 3DS system, but I'm just going to wait until another sale comes."
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,Throwawaywork321,1 point,Mon Mar 2 05:36:21 2015 UTC,Damn .... I guess that Best Buy manager is really following the rules.....  You can try Walmart and speak to a manager before the employees. I would try what you can. Sales on 3ds titles seem to me that they are few and far between.

Now that the Wii U version is out, I hardly ever touch the 3DS version. Maybe just very occasionally if I got my 3DS outside of home (which I don't often). If you play 3DS a lot away from home, it might be more valuable to you."
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,sendingsignal,5,Mon Mar 2 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"I don't really, I do love playing on the 3ds at home while something else is going on or I just wanna be under the covers, but I'm not sure I see myself playing smash like that. Unless there's some really exciting new content, I'm pretty much never gonna run into anyone else who wants to play against me on 3ds, I think."
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,bearkin1,1 point,Sun Mar 1 18:52:57 2015 UTC,"Unless there's some really exciting new content,   Yeah there's not much. All of the characters are the same. There's some different levels, a different 1P mode (Smash Run, but it's terribly boring in my opinion), and I guess the Club Nintendo special offers (free Smash Soundtrack CD and free Mewtwo DLC). For me, I bought it for the Club Nintendo special offers and the essentially 'early release' aspect. It'll get played once or twice a month but not much more than that."
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,sendingsignal,2,Sun Mar 1 18:55:25 2015 UTC,"Ok, cool, thanks for the info. I've got plenty to work through on my 3ds (especially because I never had a DS! The combined library is insane.)"

Since this is a store location I believe they would really only do local competitors. Straight off their site -  A local retail competitor for retail store purchases is a retail store authorized by a vendor to sell a new, factory-sealed product with a warranty and is located in the same market area (within a 25 mile radius) of your local Best Buy store. A local retail competitor for BestBuy.com purchases is a retail store authorized by a vendor to sell a new, factory-sealed product with a warranty and is located in the same market area (within a 25 mile radius) as either the billing address or the shipping address on record for the purchase."

3DSdeals,2xkz4f,ekw808,1 point,Sun Mar 1 19:33:05 2015 UTC,"Walmart price matched without a manager approval, and they had tons in stock. My Fred Meyer did not.  Random cashier made me show him the ad but I doubt you would even need that, as their site says ""physical ad not needed in store""."
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,tannerozzy,1 point,Sun Mar 1 19:23:36 2015 UTC,My Wal Mart refused to match even after taking to a manager and having Fred Meyer brands in my area.  In my experience WM hates to price match.
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,Pmitch11,1 point,Sun Mar 1 19:31:13 2015 UTC,"Submitted links to Amazon and when I spoke with them, they said they only price match TVs...even though I've gotten many a game price matched from them.   Anyway, this does work at Best Buy; confirmed over the phone and I saw myself that FredMeyer is in their computer system as someone they can price match. There's not even a FredMeyer around me anywhere, so YMMV but they should be able to price match."
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,joeDUBstep,1 point,Sun Mar 1 20:00:18 2015 UTC,never heard of fred meyer but best buy price matched it in store no problem.
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,sendingsignal,1 point,Mon Mar 2 08:24:51 2015 UTC,SoCal resident here. Tried to price match at best buy in Costa mesa but they said it wasn't one of the sites they price matched. As always YMMV

It specifically says:    ""We will match prices from selected online competitor websites, including...  FredMeyer.com""    Nothing about a cart. I'd go back and speak to someone higher up and show them the page below.  Toys r us price match guarantee"
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,Skynetz,1 point,Mon Mar 2 19:53:17 2015 UTC,"Just came back from Toys R Us in Auburn, MA. I got a copy of Smash and Alpha Sapphire. They have a bunch of Alpha Sapphires and maybe 2-3 copies of Omega Ruby left. No smash, I took the last one sadly :( (Also have a bunch of new 3DS's if you can't find one in your area) You MUST show their policy to them that it shows FredMeyer.com on the list of price matching."
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,Anersha,1 point,Mon Mar 2 22:55:03 2015 UTC,You can price match with Best Buy and Toys R Us for the prices listed on FredMeyer. Just got Smash and Omega Ruby for about $40 yesterday when price matching with Best Buy. You can either go in store or call to do this with Best Buy.
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,Bass_EXE,1 point,Tue Mar 3 00:06:44 2015 UTC,"Can confirm that Best Buy in Milpitas, CA honors this price match. Unfortunately they only had one copy of Pokemon OR and no Smash. Got the Pokemon, going to check out other Best buys in my area after work for Smash.  EDIT:  Sunnyvale Best Buy: No-go, they didn't even check the list on their system for Fred Meyer, they just rejected me.  Campbell Best Buy: Yup, they've never heard of Fred Meyer, but since they were on the list, they redeemed it fine. Had to show them the site on my smart phone."

3DSdeals,2xkz4f,sendingsignal,1 point,Tue Mar 3 02:10:26 2015 UTC,"Ok, I did manage to get this to work. I was at the Harrison St, SF Best Buy. I think I made the mistake of going to the customer service desk because I had a return, she was skeptical and asked me to bring it up on my phone and add it to cart, even though I'd brought a print out. Luckily enough, their site is pretty broken on mobile because if you try to scroll down the page the image pulls up and the whole site gets covered in gray that doesn't let you click anything.  She tried it on her phone to the same effect, so did the manager she called over. She said she needed manager approval to do the price match. He seemed to get frustrated/bored and just approved it, so I got Smash and Alpha sapphire. But it was frustrating.  Noticed the Alpha Sapphire came with club nintendo points! The omega ruby I got weeks earlier didn't! Almost feel like returning it and price matching it again... but it feels like too much effort."
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,stevekitten,1 point,Wed Mar 4 04:16:10 2015 UTC,"Printed the product page and brought it to a Wisconsin Walmart. The employee took a look, said ""wow,"" checked it himself, and rung it up. The closest Fred Meyers is in Idaho and they still honored it."
3DSdeals,2xkz4f,sendingsignal,1 point,Wed Mar 4 22:36:25 2015 UTC,I got Omega Ruby at Best Buy yesterday. My usual guy hooked me up. He said that since they were owned by Harris Teeter and there was a Harris Teeter right up the road that he could do it.

3DSdeals,2xki4n,Romiress,1 point,Sun Mar 1 16:30:42 2015 UTC,So there's absolutely no reason to get the older version if you get this?
3DSdeals,2xki4n,ShureNensei,3,Sun Mar 1 16:34:43 2015 UTC,"Absolutely no reason. Old one has less songs, a worse mode compared to quest mode, less characters, etc. The old one was good for it's time, but with curtain call out there's no reason to play it. The 'story' (which is extremely weak and mostly framing) is basically identical."
3DSdeals,2xki4n,Romiress,1 point,Sun Mar 1 16:36:02 2015 UTC,Thanks -- I'm not even into Rhythm games but decided to get it due to the great price + GCU discount.    Glad I never bought the older version in the past.
3DSdeals,2xki4n,ShureNensei,1 point,Sun Mar 1 16:39:49 2015 UTC,I'm not big into rhythm games either but those Final Fantasy songs bring back lots of nostalgia.

3DSdeals,2xbmlu,epythumia,1 point,Fri Feb 27 06:35:01 2015 UTC,Nintendo's justification for these type of deals: Japanese market buying habits are different then NA. They(jp) buy at a concentrated time then sales mostly drop off. Whereas NA sales continue over a consistent period of time. This would explain why Japanese eshop would have deeper discounts to generate some more sales over the long run while holding back those same deals for NA since they'll just buy anyway.

3DSdeals,2x4h1d,tannerozzy,3,Wed Feb 25 16:19:32 2015 UTC,So true I bought the powersaves at Walmart and they wouldn't let me pm their. Com site.  Twice I was denied even after the manager said I could.  She then came out and yelled at them and made them change the price for me.
3DSdeals,2x4h1d,Cfran55,2,Wed Feb 25 19:11:14 2015 UTC,"I've never been successful with having Walmart match their online price. All the stores here treat their website as a separate entity that they won't compete with.   Matching BestBuy.com is fine, but having Walmart match Walmart.com is crossing the line."
3DSdeals,2x4h1d,Timobkg,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:42:37 2015 UTC,"yeah, I'd love to have someone explain the logic behind that  (I mean, I get they can have online deals to clear out inventory at their larger warehouses and don't want to honor those deals in-store, but still, c'mon)"
3DSdeals,2x4h1d,TheGaspingGoat,2,Thu Feb 26 05:18:27 2015 UTC,"You're sitting at home, you see that thing you want on Walmart.com for a price you like.   You load up, drive all the way to a Walmart store, find what you want, wait in line to pay and realize it's a few bucks more in-store.   Shoot. You could go back online and wait 10 days for site-to-store delivery, or you could just pay a few bucks more and have it RIGHT NOW.   In that scenario, Walmart gets your money either way, and they've already baited you into a store where you might have picked up a few other items.   It's terrible and frustrating, but that's their strategy."
3DSdeals,2x4h1d,nnt_,2,Thu Feb 26 17:30:38 2015 UTC,That's not how it works though. If the store has a copy you can just buy it online and pick it up at the front a few minutes later. You only have to wait for site-to-store delivery when the store is out of stock.
3DSdeals,2x4h1d,nnt_,0,Thu Feb 26 20:41:31 2015 UTC,"No, that's exactly how it works.  If you buy something on walmart.com, site-to-store delivery comes from a distribution center by truck, even if the same item is on the shelves at that same store.  I'm not the only one who's experienced that: http://consumerist.com/2009/03/26/do-not-think-about-walmarts-website-price-matching-policy-or-risk-brain-damage/"
3DSdeals,2x4h1d,Frem,2,Thu Feb 26 20:53:11 2015 UTC,I've done site-to-store and been able to pick up my order an hour later. You definitely don't have to wait for the truck in every instance.

Just get the price adjustment done before linking your MyBestBuy to it. I did this last week with a price match to $34 and change. Came out to something like $27.20+tax.

Pays for it self pretty fast if you shop for games at Best Buy often. 20% off new in box games, 10% off used.  If you don't have Prime or Gamer Club Unlocked still worth going to Best Buy, since they will match without shipping. Will have to pay tax though."

Can't say I totally get all this, but this is less than I paid for Pokemon X used a year after release so I'm calling it a win. Best Buy price match! woo!"

3DSdeals,2wrrzx,isaakhk,1 point,Sun Feb 22 18:28:47 2015 UTC,India is a pal country but according to Nintendo India comes in Asian region which gets ntsc-U which same as america . but I went ahead and ordered a Japanese version yesterday because Nintendo doesn't have official presence in India . Flipkart and amazon sell imported models only with seller waeeenty . so don't have high hopes about the launch as it may never happen.

I will buy stuff from eshop only so it won't matter to me .

3DSdeals,2wdezz,Hellocollegejason,2,Thu Feb 19 14:42:13 2015 UTC,"What is so bad a bout it. Curious. I've only ever played the original on 64. Either way it's too late, I just ordered it."
3DSdeals,2wdezz,freypod007,2,Thu Feb 19 15:32:47 2015 UTC,"It's nothing like the original or Thousand-Year Door. They removed all of the RPG elements from the gameplay and all you use to battle are stickers. However, there really is no reason to engage in battles, as you don't gain anything from them except for stickers (which you use up in your battles).  I mean, I enjoyed it for the music and charm but I never finished after I realized how pointless the whole battling mechanic was. Really, you could run through each level, avoiding enemies completely and finish the game just fine.  As a completionist, I'm sure I'll finish it someday, but right now I have far better games to play."
3DSdeals,2wdezz,danielvdell,3,Thu Feb 19 17:29:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, that is disappointing . The main reason I liked the original was because it was an RPG. Is Thousand Year Door an RPG at least? What the hell is wrong with the developers? Why fix something that isn't broken."
3DSdeals,2wdezz,freypod007,5,Thu Feb 19 17:45:55 2015 UTC,The Thousand Year Door is very good. In my personal opinion it is better than the 64 version.
3DSdeals,2wdezz,Thermal__,1 point,Thu Feb 19 18:55:47 2015 UTC,"I haven't played Thousand-Year Door, but yes, it is like the original. Considering all the praise I see for it, I'd say it's probably even better than the first, as well. I've tried to buy it at used game shops, but even used copies are expensive."
3DSdeals,2wdezz,danielvdell,2,Thu Feb 19 18:16:28 2015 UTC,"I paid $7.99 and I liked it okay.    It's not a blockbuster by any means, and it's not Paper Mario.  The more you like paper mario, the less you will like this game.  There's tons of problems with the game, so let's go through them.  The Battle System is an interesting idea, but it's bad, stickers are basically a substitute for PP, and you have no basic attack at all.  You're also always given very little sticker space relative to what you'd need to fight the resident bad guy.  You can't beat bosses by being good.  Using your stickers perfectly will still get you killed by most bosses, which you also won't know what/where are until you get there.  Your only option will to be to fight them and die, figure out what special ""thing"" sticker is meant to kill them and use it.  Otherwise, you mostly just run out of stickers and get thrashed with no recourse but to watch.  The clues are also poor, and you'll find yourself doing extremely ""secrets"" level stuff to do normal progression.  You're also not well guided in some places and because of the world openness in the first few stages, you can skip tasks and backtrack.  It's not really clear that some things are all in one WORLD, not just among the levels you have access to.  It's really annoying because the second half of the game is more or less on rails, I felt like the levels were backwards.  The final battle with Bowser is also mostly about knowing which ""things""-stickers you need.  Thing stickers also aren't done very well.  Sometimes you'll find a spot where an oven works fine, but a heater won't work; but sometimes a tape or glue or staples, etc will work.    The whole game is more of a platformer with puzzles than an RPG and sometimes what you have to do is so stupid that you consult a guide or guide video and you see that person actually used a glitch to get past that area.  It never feels rewarding when you work out what you were supposed to do, you just feel like the game is stupid.  Usually, in games like this gameplay is consistent and it builds on earlier gameplay, that's just not what happened here.  The story is also really weak and there's pretty much no extraneous characters and there are bits of information that just don't get told to you by NPCs.  Also, periodically, you'll run into puzzles where you have to interact with elements of a stage in non-intuitive ways, when you'd expect to use a sticker (the main freaking game mechanic) or talk to someone like an RPG.  Usually, you need a sticker for those situation, but 2 or 3 times, you need to do something stupid with Mario."
3DSdeals,2wdezz,ILikeLenexa,3,Tue Feb 24 16:37:46 2015 UTC,"Ok, I just received the game in the mail yesterday. What you ahve mentioned about using specific things is true. I have discovered that after my first ""boss"" battle with Bowser Jr. I used the items perfectly and was able to get him down to 1 HP and he just recovered all of it back the next turn. Then he said something a long the lines of ""Don't you dare use that special sticker"" So of course I used it and it killed him in one hit. I was like WTF. I just wasted 5 boots and hammers and couldn't beat him.  I will say there is a small level of skill involved in timing your hits and deciding which items to toss and/or keep. I am constantly tossing the weaker items and making sure I have the best options stocked in my sticker book."
3DSdeals,2wdezz,freypod007,2,Tue Feb 24 17:09:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not as bad with that boss as with other bosses when you've encountered many Things and have no idea what to take and they won't all fit in your book.    I did actually manage to beat the end boss in level 2 with (all of my) regular stickers, but only because I'd accidentally finished World 3 looking for stuff otherwise I would've run out of stickers.  (then Kersti mocked me)  I think the game gets cute once you get to World 4, but there's not a lot to get out of the final battle."
3DSdeals,2wdezz,ILikeLenexa,6,Tue Feb 24 17:27:37 2015 UTC,Btw this game is not very good

3DSdeals,2wdezz,TheOuyaWasntBad,2,Thu Feb 19 15:51:19 2015 UTC,"Might be an unpopular opinion, but I don't know why people hate on this game so much. I know it's not a good Paper Mario game, seeing as how they stripped away pretty much all RPG elements, but it's still a good Mario game overall.  The story isn't bad, the gameplay is solid, it has that Nintendo charm to it, the visuals are great, and the whole sticker thing was a great idea, it was just poorly executed. The game basically went from being an RPG to being about resource-management, which does kinda suck, but it's not a terrible game by any means. It's just disappointing by Paper Mario standards."

3DSdeals,2w9wc8,sendingsignal,1 point,Wed Feb 18 05:53:53 2015 UTC,That's odd. I think shipping is free on any order over $35. Not to mention the promotion info page explicitly states free shipping.  http://www.bestbuy.com/site/null/special-offer/pcmcat362400050003.c?id=pcmcat362400050003
3DSdeals,2w9wc8,sendingsignal,1 point,Wed Feb 18 09:05:41 2015 UTC,"yeah, i think it was saying no shipping as in it wasn't availaible in stock for online, just that it might still be in some stores"
3DSdeals,2w9wc8,Icouldbeanyone,1 point,Fri Feb 20 07:32:37 2015 UTC,"It should update.  On release day I tried to use my $50 credit from the botched pre-order of MM on a copy of MH4U.  Waited and ordered Sunday (store 10 mins away) and shipping was available then.  I guess they have limited stock online, because on Friday no shipping, no store close to me, only one 45+ minutes away had it."

3DSdeals,2w9wc8,ss4444gogeta,2,Wed Feb 18 04:02:08 2015 UTC,This has been the case for this game during its preorder. I bought it in store on Friday and they gave me a gift card.

Not only will no one give you a straight answer here or help you in any way, you'll just be berated and made fun of for not joining the circlejerk."
3DSdeals,2w93kq,ametalshard,7,Wed Feb 18 03:11:32 2015 UTC,Dude it just came out what do you expect to get it for.
3DSdeals,2w93kq,InsertCoinHere,0,Wed Feb 18 00:05:03 2015 UTC,Mh4 just came out and there was a $10 gift card for it at best buy.

3DSdeals,2w93kq,xiviajikx,2,Wed Feb 18 04:54:26 2015 UTC,Get GCU from best buy (I'm pretty sure it's still $30) then use it for all your future games. It should bring the cost of MM down to $32.
3DSdeals,2w93kq,NOBLExGAMER,4,Wed Feb 18 01:08:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, you mean that game that just came out 4 days ago? Yeah, think I saw it for $3.50 at FuncoLand."

3DSdeals,2w3fzi,hocotate,1 point,Mon Feb 16 20:48:12 2015 UTC,Idk it could just be the off brands. I got a sony card for my old 3DS when there was a big sale and everyone in the thread then said they worked. I would be wary of using a non big name brand though.

3DSdeals,2w13zk,sendingsignal,1 point,Sat Feb 21 04:35:02 2015 UTC,So this gives two years of membership? If I remember correctly it's 10% off preorders plus 10 dollars when you buy a new game? Does that stack?  If you get it in store does it work online?
3DSdeals,2w13zk,sendingsignal,1 point,Mon Feb 16 02:53:35 2015 UTC,oh but it's only select games? Is this ever wii U / 3ds games? It's only the nintendo games that always stay up in price.
3DSdeals,2w13zk,Wretro,7,Mon Feb 16 02:55:12 2015 UTC,"You can read about the program here.  It's 20% off new games (pre-order or non pre-order), 10% off used, and a few other things for 2 years. For $30 it's a steal, especially for Nintendo games. It also works on stuff like amiibo. The $10 gift thing is a general Best Buy promotion for select games but it does stack - Monster Hunter 4 comes with the $10 gift card + an $8 discount from GCU.  You can only get it in-store but it does work online once you're signed up."
3DSdeals,2w13zk,sendingsignal,1 point,Mon Feb 16 03:21:16 2015 UTC,"Cool thanks. Does the deal also apply to if I get a New 3DS XL?   I'll head by the store tomorrow, I'm still thinking about getting Captain Toad and Hyrule warriors and I knoowwww I'm getting Mario Party 10 and Yoshi's Woolly World, so.. I'm sure that's about 30 bucks saved there already. I'll probably get xenoblade when it comes out... so.. Well, I'm guessing that will pay the membership, we'll see if it comes out to more than I'd save just looking forward to sales on amazon.   I'm doing some heavy math in my head cause my amazon card gives me 3% back on any purchases there and often games end up discounted 10-15% a bit after release."
3DSdeals,2w13zk,Wretro,6,Mon Feb 16 03:51:35 2015 UTC,"GCU doesn't apply to hardware unfortunately, that'd be a bit too lucrative. :P  The way I go about it is to make pre-orders with both BB and Amazon, since they don't charge until they ship, and wait to see how prices + incentives go. A good example is Monster Hunter 4 which had very competitive pre-order pricing. Amazon had them beat on the immediate price you pay assuming you pre-ordered early enough at $27.36 + the pre-order pin, but BB technically ""won"" at $32 + $10 gift card.  In a case like that it'll depend on how much you value the gift card and whether you have anything extra to apply (Bing rewards gift cards, Amazon cash back, My Best Buy gift cards, etc). That's a pretty abnormal situation for a Nintendo game though, since they don't tend to get price reductions like that...in which case, BB tends to be the better choice.  I tend to favor BB because I have a Discover card that nets me 5% additional cash back on top of my card's current bonus from them vs my Amazon Visa's flat 3%. October through December it actually increases to 10% (5% extra + 5% internet purchases quarterly bonus). That + GCU is a very hard combo to beat."
3DSdeals,2w13zk,sendingsignal,1 point,Mon Feb 16 04:25:56 2015 UTC,"Damn, the what's the discover category that works at BB?"
3DSdeals,2w13zk,Wretro,2,Mon Feb 16 04:29:41 2015 UTC,"You have to go through Discover Deals and give them the site referral (so turn off stuff like NoScript, etc that blocks it) and then complete the purchase via your Discover.  The stores in Discover Deals fluctuate, both in percentage and being there at all (Groupon is currently 5% but will reduce during that ridiculous Oct-Dec bonus period, while Target used to be there but has left the program), but BB has been there at 5% for as long as I've been a card holder."
3DSdeals,2w13zk,sendingsignal,1 point,Mon Feb 16 04:34:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, interesting. My partner already has that discover so maybe we'll just use that.   So checking back, the one 'old' Wii U game I didn't get by nintendo, DK Tropical Freeze, is used at 40 (plus 4 shipping) at Amazon, and would be 40 with discount for a new copy from BB. So yeah, It does seem worth it. Wind Waker HD is still at 42 used.  I'm sure there are periodic sales, but I'm also kind of.. happy to buy Nintendo games on release, I want them to have good sales numbers? I don't know why I feel that loyalty. Underdog console wars nostalgia stuff or something, on steam I just wait until games are super crazy cheap."
3DSdeals,2w13zk,Wretro,2,Mon Feb 16 04:49:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll wait a ridiculously long time to pick up something on Steam but pre-order games on Nintendo systems all the time. I think part of it is that I kind of dislike the eShop and have an irrational fear of games going out of print much sooner than I expect.  Sales like FE:A for $15 is like finding a unicorn, anyway. That was so ridiculous I actually kept the receipt to remind myself that it actually happened."
3DSdeals,2w13zk,sendingsignal,2,Mon Feb 16 05:00:56 2015 UTC,"yeah, I just noticed a really nice atlus deal that i don't even want to talk about because i have to go into the store tomorrow to get the membership first before ordering this sweet used copy online.  i just made an excel (lol us) and it seems that before cash back (and assuming that 5% discover beats 3% amazon, plus ignoring points + gift certs for buying the new 3ds, and spending all this stuff) it's gonna be well worth it. This is gonna be hilariously unformatted via paste:  hyrule warriors captain toad treasure tracker  kirby and the rainbow curse mario party 10 yoshis woolly world xenoblade chronicles 3d persona Q shadow of the labyrinth devil survivor 2 break record new legend of zelda  Amazon New / Amazon Used / BB (Mostly New) 439.91  318.95  323.43  anyway, 440 vs 323 at the prices i could find, so slap on that 30 and it's still just shy of 100 dollars in savings. Nice!"
3DSdeals,2w13zk,ShureNensei,1 point,Mon Feb 16 05:07:03 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, most 3DS games don't offer a preorder discount bonus apart from GCU -- I think those are mostly for AAA games on the major consoles/PC.  Stuff like the MH4 preorder gift card is rare from what I've seen."
3DSdeals,2w13zk,MrSelatcia,1 point,Mon Feb 16 04:13:55 2015 UTC,The only problem with this is I have yet to talk to a single best buy employee that even knows what this program is.
3DSdeals,2w13zk,ShureNensei,3,Mon Feb 16 03:25:01 2015 UTC,You have to get one of those GCU cards that are in the digital sale section of the store alongside eshop/psn/etc. cards.  Then they just scan it at the register like any other product.  You have to be a member of BB Rewards though.

3DSdeals,2vv3w0,bearkin1,3,Sun Feb 15 06:44:14 2015 UTC,"Best chance is Amazon. Maybe once or twice a month they get some in stock, new, S+S by Amazon, for $40, but they tend to sell out within 5min.

3DSdeals,2vv3w0,ignition386,4,Sat Feb 14 11:18:31 2015 UTC,Patience pays off. Set up some price alerts on camelcamelcamel and set up some searches on your local version of Craigslist/Kijiji. I got a used copy with unused club Nintendo code for $25 a few months back.
3DSdeals,2vv3w0,msaleem,8,Sat Feb 14 12:52:09 2015 UTC,"I had luck finding a copy at my local Walmart.  Walmart's website won't show you the stock status for OoT3D because they don't carry it online, but you can use this site to check inventory near your zip code.

3DSdeals,2vv3w0,rarelypost,2,Sat Feb 14 11:15:20 2015 UTC,do they typically reprint after they've stopped? not that familiar with how they do this.
3DSdeals,2vv3w0,Stonecutter,2,Mon Feb 23 21:01:45 2015 UTC,"I'd say the likelihood is pretty low of getting a reprint since they probably would've done it already but you can always wait and see what happens.  They would only reprint if they see enough demand but I'm guessing many people were waiting on a sale that never came to pick it up, which makes it look like there was little demand for it, so in Nintendo's eyes there's little reason to reprint since the demand appears so low.  If you need one now, you could try to find a cheap one somewhere or just get the eShop version.  I missed out myself since I was waiting for a good sale and then I find out one day it's sold out everywhere.  I personally am just going to wait for either the used copies to drop in price or for a reprint."

3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Coraldragon,2,Wed Feb 11 19:33:36 2015 UTC,"A good way to figure out if this is worth it to you is if you foresee spending more than five times the membership cost (in this case $30 x 5 = $150) of new games within the two years as that would be the break even price.  Also, they often have deals for around this price every now and then, so there's absolutely no reason to get the original $99 price or feel rushed if you're unsure.  Lastly, membership stacks, though who knows what will happen with BB years from now."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,ShureNensei,3,Wed Feb 11 23:54:08 2015 UTC,Are you able to use the 20% off when games are on sale for another reason? I normally don't pay full price for most games anyways (although there's the occasional new release that I go for right away).
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Broke_stupid_lonely,6,Tue Feb 10 20:11:46 2015 UTC,Yes
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,dr3amsINdigital,3,Tue Feb 10 20:33:59 2015 UTC,Break even price would just be $30. Discount of 5 times the membership cost is just a preference.
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Po0zleP0under,2,Tue Feb 10 20:55:01 2015 UTC,Still amounts to the same thing mathematically -- I just think it's easier to visualize if one can spend $150 versus getting $30 in discounts on games of various prices.  Not sure what else you meant if that wasn't the case.
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,ShureNensei,1 point,Wed Feb 11 18:05:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see what you mean now. You multiplied 30 with 5 because it's the inverse of 20%. Instead of thinking that we need to spend 150 for it to be a discount, I thought you were saying that we need to get $150 worth of discount for it to be break even (I basically though $150 is the 20%, so we need to spend $750). My bad"

3DSdeals,2vg5vv,ShureNensei,2,Thu Feb 12 02:53:53 2015 UTC,"In otherwords, it's worth it if you can see yourself buying at least 4 3DS games at full price over the next 2 years. The membership will then have paid for itself, and any purchases after that will just be a discount."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,dr3amsINdigital,2,Thu Feb 12 02:58:01 2015 UTC,"If I have something on pre-order that has not been charged yet and buy this membership, will they apply the 20% off to the pre-order?"

3DSdeals,2vg5vv,holder_account,2,Tue Feb 10 22:49:08 2015 UTC,Actually got the answer.  Would have to cancel pre-order then pre-order it again to receive the discount.
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,holder_account,2,Tue Feb 10 22:53:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. So I got in on that great walmart preorder deal and have quite a few games preordered at huge savings. I wonder if they would honor the older pricematch as the current prices reflect the normal prices.. . I guess id rather not risk it.. anyone have experience ?
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,creepy_hawaiian,2,Tue Feb 10 22:58:23 2015 UTC,"I have GCU. Last October, I purchased Sunset Overdrive a couple/few days before I found out about the $30 GCU sale the last time Best Buy did this promo. To get the 20% discount, they had me ""return"" Sunset Overdrive, purchase the membership and then I ""repurchased"" Sunset Overdrive at a 20% discount. As long as it's within the statutes of their price adjusting policy (which I believe is 15 days), they should honor it.  With regard to pre-orders, you may want to cancel the pre-order (unless it's something that's sold out/hard to come by... stay with me here), buy the membership, then place your pre-order again. If it's a game that is released within the limits of their 15 day price adjusting policy and while the GCU membership is still on sale, you could pay full price for the pre-order, go buy the membership and then have them price adjust to get you the 20% off.   They don't charge you for pre-orders until the day before release so as long as you have the membership, anything you add to your cart online or buy in store should reflect the 20% discount.   Edit: I took so long typing my response that you found the answer on your own. :-/"
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Cecilgene,3,Wed Feb 11 00:23:36 2015 UTC,"I called them.  The pre-order in question is the limited MM...yea, not gonna cancel that one."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,holder_account,2,Tue Feb 10 23:08:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you wouldn't get a discount on that anyway."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Cecilgene,2,Tue Feb 10 23:53:07 2015 UTC,"I think he/she is referring to the limited edition of the game, which they would get a discount on."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,dr3amsINdigital,2,Wed Feb 11 00:09:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't realize there was also a limited edition game. Not a big Zelda fan (I know, blasphemy). Yes, the discount would apply in that case. :-)"
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Cecilgene,2,Wed Feb 11 00:12:11 2015 UTC,How come?  Special edition?
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,holder_account,2,Wed Feb 11 00:14:16 2015 UTC,"I thought that they were referring to the New 3DS system, not the Special Edition game. The discount would apply to the game, the discount would not apply to the 3DS. The discount is only good on games, not consoles."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Cecilgene,2,Wed Feb 11 00:23:15 2015 UTC,The 20% off doesn't apply to the preorder until you purchase the game. My friend works at Best Buy and has this membership for free. We use it all the time.
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Hooray4Homicide,2,Wed Feb 11 00:25:49 2015 UTC,Anyone here already have this membership? Is it worth it?
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,NeoMegamanX,3,Wed Feb 11 03:17:58 2015 UTC,I think so. It also useful for gifting friends as long as you don't go over the 3 title limit.
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Coraldragon,2,Tue Feb 10 22:27:35 2015 UTC,3 title limit? Do you mean purchase more than three games at once?
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,ShadowEdge6,2,Wed Feb 11 00:58:07 2015 UTC,"They have a limit of 3 of the same title. Example: You cannot buy 3 Sunset Overdrive with the discount. If you do, they have the right to terminate your UGCU. It's on the rules."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Coraldragon,2,Wed Feb 11 12:46:20 2015 UTC,Ah OK I got no problem with that. I can see how people can abuse that.
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,ShadowEdge6,3,Wed Feb 11 14:33:41 2015 UTC,"Yea, it's mostly to prevent abuse.  I meant to say you cannot buy more than 3 of the same title. Realize now that I didn't specify before."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Coraldragon,2,Wed Feb 11 17:39:56 2015 UTC,"If you buy a lot of new games, it's worth it. A $59.99 game becomes a $47.99 game. Even if a game is already on sale, you still get an extra 20% off the sale price. I recently bought a game that was already on sale from $59.99, reduced to $39.99 but it was only $31.99 after GCU was applied. Plus, if you buy any used games you get 10% off of those."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Cecilgene,2,Wed Feb 11 17:47:55 2015 UTC,Can this be used towards eshop cards? Accessories?
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,NeoMegamanX,2,Tue Feb 10 23:30:08 2015 UTC,"No, only games. No consoles, accessories or gift cards."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Cecilgene,2,Tue Feb 10 23:36:20 2015 UTC,Does it have to be new release or can I pick up new copy of Smash 3DS and get the 20% off?
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Amanlikeyou,2,Tue Feb 10 23:40:11 2015 UTC,Any games.
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,dr3amsINdigital,3,Wed Feb 11 06:20:48 2015 UTC,"20% on NEW games. New is defined as not pre-owned, not released within a certain time period.   10% on Pre-owned games."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Selykg,2,Wed Feb 11 06:47:11 2015 UTC,Any game! Smash would qualify. It would be $31.99 after your discount.
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Cecilgene,2,Wed Feb 11 15:44:29 2015 UTC,This is actually really awesome. Assuming I can pick up a N3DS this Friday. I'll hit Best Buy to pick up a couple games. I was thinking Smash and Majora's Mask should be a good start.
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Amanlikeyou,2,Wed Feb 11 19:32:10 2015 UTC,"I'm reading that the GCU sale doesn't start until Sunday though, so you may need to wait a couple of days. Other comments mention that stores are honoring the sale a little early. YMMV, you may want to ask at your local store."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Cecilgene,2,Wed Feb 11 19:52:26 2015 UTC,My cousin actually has one of those. I used his phone number and they didn't care when I bought a new game a few weeks ago.
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Amanlikeyou,2,Wed Feb 11 19:55:03 2015 UTC,"I have it, it's decent; but I also got it when they had a deal where you got it if you set up a cell phone account so I bought a $6 sim card.  It works on amiibo's so they come out to $10.50ish, if you just have a 3DS and a Wii U like I do it's ok, you'll probably get more value if you have an XBOX or PS4 as they have way more titles for those."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,ItsBattle,2,Wed Feb 11 22:15:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't see anything about it in the weekly ad online. But I'll go in tomorrow and see. It'd be cool to get that for 30 bucks, then preorder mh4u and get a 10 dollar gift card and 20% off."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,_shift,2,Wed Feb 11 17:07:06 2015 UTC,"Next week, 2/15 to 2/21, it'll be at all locations for for sure.  mejjos said that above just in case."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,ShadowEdge6,2,Wed Feb 11 01:59:05 2015 UTC,"I can't find a solid answer on this; I activated mine last week, if I buy this this week will it add 2 years at the end of my subscription? I heard some say it adds 2 years to the date the new card is activated."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,voneahhh,3,Wed Feb 11 18:28:20 2015 UTC,"It should and you can verify by going to your account benefits on bestbuy.com.  I ended up buying three subscriptions on a ridiculous deal a number of months ago, and mine doesn't expire until late 2020."
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,ShureNensei,2,Wed Feb 11 02:24:54 2015 UTC,is there a limit as to how much you can use the 20% off new video games? I've heard that it's limited to 3 times a year or something like that.
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,MixedMartialFartist,3,Wed Feb 11 06:52:29 2015 UTC,No the limit is the same game per year. Basically you can only get a discount on three copies of Super Smash Brothers for example. There's no limit on different titles.
3DSdeals,2vg5vv,Neil_deNye_Sagan,1 point,Thu Feb 12 08:22:11 2015 UTC,I don't see this deal in my Best Buy's weekly ad.  Is the deal location based or am I just blind?

3DSdeals,2vcn8f,GraveTracer,3,Tue Feb 10 02:39:41 2015 UTC,Considering Square doesn't want anything to do in the West 3DS wise outside of Final Fantasy I'm not surprised.

3DSdeals,2vcn8f,semperverus,1 point,Tue Feb 10 03:13:50 2015 UTC,Theirs is usually on their website and for physical copies.
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,corymatthews423,1 point,Tue Feb 10 10:37:53 2015 UTC,"Well, Square-Enix did just have a big sale on Steam over the weekend"
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,BIGREDDMACH1NE,5,Tue Feb 10 23:05:08 2015 UTC,If you pair this with Best Buy's eShop sale you can get these technically for $13.50ish.
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,LilithCathcart,4,Tue Feb 10 06:59:06 2015 UTC,"It's not weird at all. Buying from Steam, you have it on multiple devices fairly easily and if you transition systems your games come with you. Plus, it's routinely extremely cheap and convenient. The convenience outweighs the benefits and appeal of a physical collection.  The exact opposite is true for 3DS, where between storage space fuckery in the form of obtuse ""blocks"", no longer easily removable SD cards, no games tied permanently to accounts, etc etc, it's actually more convenient to go physical."
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,yes_it_is_weird,13,Mon Feb 9 22:48:02 2015 UTC,
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,Timobkg,3,Mon Feb 9 22:56:24 2015 UTC,I do the same thing. Mostly because of Nintendo's archaic approach to social distribution.
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,12thCenExcaliburrr,1 point,Tue Feb 10 09:43:04 2015 UTC,"Same, but some of these games only give Club Nintendo for their digital versions. Something to consider if you're looking for more coins. I know EO IV and SMT:DSO only give CN coins for their digital copies."
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,markzone110,3,Mon Feb 9 22:56:52 2015 UTC,Which of these games should I get as a newcomer to either series?
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,markzone110,4,Mon Feb 9 23:07:20 2015 UTC,"none of them are directly connected but I'd recommend DS - Overclocked or SMT4, just know that SMT4 is SMT Hard."
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,firstfollow,1 point,Tue Feb 10 01:21:01 2015 UTC,Is it a rewarding kind of hard or just frustrating?
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,Timobkg,3,Mon Feb 9 22:46:13 2015 UTC,"Rewarding.  Really, though, SMTIV is often considered to be the easiest game in the series once you get past the first few hours."
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,reeegiii,2,Mon Feb 9 22:48:06 2015 UTC,"The first few hours kind of suck, and you have to save after every battle at the beginning. But it gets much better after that.  Also, you can save at any point and before boss fights, revive for in game cash or play coins, and switch to easy difficulty after your second death.  A top to make the first few hours better: the ""End Talks"" option in demon negotiation translates to ""I've given you enough, join me or die!"", and is very effective."
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,firstfollow,1 point,Mon Feb 9 22:50:35 2015 UTC,"It really depends on you. I was loving this game for like the first 5-10 hours then it easily became one of the most frustrating game I've ever played because of the terrible map. The demon recruiting too is so fucking tedious, in my experience."
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,markzone110,2,Mon Feb 9 22:53:39 2015 UTC,SMTIV for SMT.  Either EO will work; they're both accessible to new players.
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,Dartkun,1 point,Mon Feb 9 23:11:38 2015 UTC,Any particular feelings on Code of Princess? I see that it's on sale as well
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,Timobkg,1 point,Mon Feb 9 23:27:01 2015 UTC,"Its an Ok brawler, the slowdown drove me crazy as it cannot maintain its frame rate in fights with more than 4 things... I wouldn't pick it up unless it was around $5."
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,Throwawaywork321,2,Mon Feb 9 22:48:54 2015 UTC,"I would recommend SMT IV and Etrian Odyssey IV or Untold.   EO IV is the better game, IMO, but Untold is slightly more accessible."
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,LisaHayes,3,Mon Feb 9 22:55:29 2015 UTC,Well this sucks... can't buy any because I will not get my 3ds until after the 16....:(
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,Selykg,4,Mon Feb 9 23:01:50 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, these games go on sale for 50% off pretty frequently it seems. I've bought a couple of them now. One was just last month."
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,Throwawaywork321,2,Mon Feb 9 23:15:02 2015 UTC,Pretty sure you can buy these on the eshop website. Like here:  http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/IFBKB39761rBuUcpxVkqT2ELtkyB70EB
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,Selykg,2,Tue Feb 10 00:49:32 2015 UTC,Sadly nope. Not with out the the 3ds system. I checked on two earlier. Says please visit the nintendo 3ds eshop to purchase.  It is what it is. Just don't understand why they do not extend it.
3DSdeals,2vcn8f,Throwawaywork321,1 point,Tue Feb 10 03:07:19 2015 UTC,"Well, if there's anything Nintendo sucks at its pretty much everything except making games.   Online play? Meh.   Drm?

3DSdeals,2vcn8f,Selykg,2,Tue Feb 10 01:20:18 2015 UTC,Yeah sadly the list is long and I hope they work on a lot of stuff. Getting back into Nintendo with the new handhelds but I hope I don't regret it later.   I know I will not for the games but with what they decide to do on future ideas.

Checked SMT IV and it's not available online, probably not any of the rest either. You may just need to either deal with the normal prices or get the 3DS sooner.  For what it's worth you can find some download codes for purchase at GameStops (or EB Games if you're in Canada), but I doubt they go by the eShop sales."

3DSdeals,2v9k7j,rabiiiii,1 point,Thu Feb 12 16:17:26 2015 UTC,I went to a local Kmart last friday. Took a little time to find the games since there were so few of them. I found Wolfeinstein New Order for ps4 for only $30 though. Thats the cheapest I've seen for a new copy.

3DSdeals,2v9k7j,phantomzero79,1 point,Mon Feb 9 15:43:50 2015 UTC,Mine had nothing worth noting on sale. Smash Bros 3DS fro $43.99 at mine. 2DS was $130 and a lot of other games were close or at full retail price. Nothing noticeable as far as sales.

3DSdeals,2v87q4,laserosx,9,Sun Feb 8 22:26:25 2015 UTC,But if you can buy them for a dollar surely Nintendo could've included one with the system if it costs them pennies at the most..
3DSdeals,2v87q4,Lyezech,1 point,Sun Feb 8 23:06:51 2015 UTC,I think it was a logical cost cutting move. many n3ds buyers already have a ds and that alone is reason enough for them to not include it. sucks for trade ins and new ds owners but it's understandable at least.
3DSdeals,2v87q4,jug_ornot,2,Mon Feb 9 21:09:16 2015 UTC,It's bullshit. Name one other electronic product that needs and doesn't come with a charger.

There's a ton to do and you can get really involved.  It's an excellent game if you like sim-type games or liked animal crossing in the past.  Fantasy life is also really fun.  It's very dialog heavy, and I ended up skipping some but the game is great fun.    I never played luigis mansion, so nothing on that.

3DSdeals,2v1pnk,RiotDX,2,Sun Feb 8 13:27:47 2015 UTC,the size of the New 3DS XL and 3DS XL are almost the same only mm difference. So old XL cases should be fine for the New XL. If you are looking for a deal then you'll just have to look for clearances or check gamestop. I had good luck at a gamestop near me when looking for a case with a strap. I got this type of DS case for $3 was really lucky the guy remembered it in the back of the store when I was asking for a case with a strap. A 3ds xl vault case fit perfectly inside it

3DSdeals,2un9p8,autumn-solace,1 point,Thu Feb 5 13:34:18 2015 UTC,"I swung by a Target in Calgary last night and they had Game Accessories on for 20% off the tag price, and one sign hidden away on the last row of games saying 10% of Game Software. So, presumably all games == 10% off.  Better than a kick in the pants, but might just be worth waiting until the games just generally drop in price if you were hoping to get something with a new-ish price tag (though some older games like Bravely Default and Yoshi's Island are still selling at their starting price across all stores, so who knows when we'd see a price drop).  Maybe they'll lower prices again if things don't get sold right away? I don't know how these things are done.  Also, to teh English/French game comment: I've noticed recently that Nintendo has shipped separate language instruction manuals, not multi-language manuals, in a few games, and that the game insert on the case is also duplicated (IIRC), so they could probably sell them in the US if anyone in 'Murika would tolerate having to remove the material in French. shrug"
