CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,drak0bsidian,73,Tue Jul 21 14:08:58 2015 UTC,"This really bums me out. An appropriate response to the popularity of state and national campgrounds would be an investment in expanding capacity and adding additional campground locations throughout the country. Instead, we have seen existing campground infrastructure turned over to a number of private concessionaire's, who frequently use what the public built and paid for to generate their private profits. I feel like I have seen prices go from the 7-10 range to the 15-20 range in the last few years without any increase in sites or amenities. Just helping the concessionaire pad their margins.   ""Unleashing the Market""TM can never replace public provision. We should be working to expand access to our public lands, not force people to turn to private land owners."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,postrnut,16,Tue Jul 21 14:51:28 2015 UTC,"I think the term ""overcrowded"" in this article refers more to privacy rather than physically space. State parks are rarely full, but sites are often situated very close to each other which means one inconsiderate neighbor can ruin the experience for a number of other camp sites. Electric hookups, flush toilets and hot showers attract people who otherwise might not go camping. This isn't a bad thing, but these campers tend to be the ones who don't clean up after themselves, run generators all night and generally are inconsiderate of their neighbors privacy.   Also, around where I camp (central PA) during football season about 75% of the RV's are people en route to a Penn State football game who turn their camp site into an all day tailgate."

CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Christof3,2,Tue Jul 21 17:33:32 2015 UTC,"State Parks in CA are charging about the same.   Or I can drive an extra hour to Yosemite and do a wilderness permit for free.   I love supporting state and national parks, but CA just feels like it's gouging."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,imhostfu,6,Tue Jul 21 20:25:39 2015 UTC,"Do we really want to develop more land on public grounds instead of leaving it natural? I know the popularity is an issue, but isn't the ""nature"" aspect of it a big part?"
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,winkw,7,Tue Jul 21 16:17:17 2015 UTC,"Let me be clear: not suggesting large scale development. Suggesting that we invest in establishing increasing capacity at existing campgrounds, improve road access to the hundreds of campgrounds that are underutilized as a result of poor access, and build new campgrounds in areas where the demand makes clear there is a need. Personally, not as worried about developing campgrounds as I would be the development of other types of facilities. I for one think the whole country would be better off and happier if more people got out there."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,postrnut,2,Tue Jul 21 17:24:18 2015 UTC,In my state there are only a couple weeks(good weather and holidays) during the year when camp sites are full. The rest of the time they are a ghost town. Would increasing the camp area be financially feasible when its only for 21 days out of the year?
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Sloppy_Twat,2,Tue Jul 21 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"I did not necessarily suggest a one size fits all policy. However, in my experience, a lot of campgrounds in National Parks, National Forests, and State Parks tend to fill up at least on the weekends, and in many areas through the week as well.  But I am also comfortable having some slack utilization at certain times of the year if it is necessary to let more people use their public lands during peak usage. I mean, adding an additional campsite costs what? A couple of hundred bucks? Clear an area, level, maybe some pea gravel or dirt, a steel fire ring, and a picnic table? And even if we want to go worst case scenario, and throw in producing an EIA, putting in outhouses, and drilling a well, the cost is what? Low six figures? For a facility that can be enjoyed by tens of thousands of Americans over its lifetime? That is the whole point of public provision: it isn't done to produce a profit."

For a facility that can be enjoyed by tens of thousands of Americans over its lifetime? That is the whole point of public provision: it isn't done to produce a profit.   Its not the initial cost that is the financial barrier for creating more campsites in existing parks. The cost barrier will be the maintence, upkeep, and enforcement. The maintence/upkeep will be cutting extra grass, more roads to fix, extra bathrooms to clean, building maintence, and extra utility cost. The extra guest will also put a strain on the existing resources in the park thus increasing maintenence cost in all areas of the park.  The enforcement will be more park rangers to do the deal with the extra campers in the park and most park rangers average $45,000/year plus benefits and retirement.  Then when the few above average camping weeks are over then the added park rangers won't be needed."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Sloppy_Twat,2,Tue Jul 21 18:56:52 2015 UTC,"Again, I think we can quibble. I think you have National Park/State Park in mind, where I am thinking more of the many National Forest campgrounds where maintenance is frequently lower, and a lot of the enforcement is provided by volunteer 'hosts'.   Spending significantly more money on our public lands is something I totally support. They are currently poorly resourced and understaffed."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,postrnut,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"No, we were talking about national Forrest/state parks because those are the ones with the over crowding problems.

CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Sloppy_Twat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is dishonest at all. My response to your post was to highlight that there is a continuum of campsites, from the highly developed, expensive to maintain, ranger run type to the 'couple of tables, fire rings, and some gravel' type. The former are often found in National Parks/State Parks, and the latter in National Forests. And while I may not have properly accounted for upkeep costs in the more developed ones, I would argue you were overestimating the costs in the less developed ones.   I have camped in National Forest campgrounds a dozen times in the last two years. I have never seen a National Forest employee in them. Many of the times, in areas with grass, it hasn't been mowed in weeks when I visit. In many of them, I bet annual upkeep costs approach zero."

CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Devvils,3,Tue Jul 21 21:08:08 2015 UTC,"Why can't it be both? There's a severe shortage of public campsites, particularly in popular areas. They often get booked out months in advance in only a few minutes after openings are released. That's severe under-supply. Not surprising private interests are grabbing that excess demand. (Not to mention public campgrounds typically having terrible upkeep and a severe lack of privacy from adjacent sites).   I'm all for making camping more accessible and not having to plan trips 6 months out, or having to take a Thursday and Friday off from work to (maybe) be able to snag a first-come site."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,whitecompass,3,Tue Jul 21 19:30:40 2015 UTC,"I think it can be both! I just come down strongly on the side that for a multitude of reasons, I think the preferred solution for the increasing popularity of our national public lands is an expansion of public facilities.   At the end of the day, I believe accessing the outdoors and beautiful public lands is a human right. And while many may not choose to utilize that opportunity, it should be available to all. Public provision is the best way to ensure that certain values (access, equity) are prioritized in securing the access. Private solutions ensure the dominance of one value (profit) over all others."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,postrnut,3,Tue Jul 21 19:38:51 2015 UTC,"Then it shouldn't bum you out, man! Let there be different types of solutions for different types of people.  Public campsites are great for those folks who want to pay a very cheap fee to access public lands. I agree with you that the majority of this effort should be public. It is absolutely a human right. However, there's no shame in a smart developer leasing out excess private land via HipCamp or developing upscale, private campgrounds with different attributes than those found in public/group campsites (i.e., spread out vs. crammed, tent vs. RV, bathrooms vs. pit toilets, etc.). Personally, I would pay a hefty premium to access a perfect, secluded tent campsite with a great view where I won't have neighbors in the immediate vicinity or RVs running generators. If there's a market for it, people will build it. It even exists in some places. Check out Ventana or Treebones in Big Sur, or El Capitan in Santa Barbara.  I remember recently camping out in Moab. Had to get out there on a Wednesday because it's all first-come-first-serve (or completely booked up months in advance). I was lucky to find a great spot at Fisher Towers, the only FCFS spot left. As I sat there that night, I saw more than 50 vehicles drive up the long access road, only to be disappointed that all the spots were taken. Most of the cars were Audis, Range Rovers, etc. It was getting dark and I guarantee those folks would have paid upwards of $200/night for even a public campsite, never mind a campsite that is built to suit what they're really looking for -- likely Instagram-worthy seclusion and views.  Forcing people to have the foresight 6 months out is, to me, the real restriction on access to camping - not private landowners leasing out or developing their own solution."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,whitecompass,2,Tue Jul 21 19:51:33 2015 UTC,"I am not against people using their private land as a campground at all. Not against people paying top dollar. It bums me out because I am reading a story about 'private market expanding in response to increased demand' instead of 'Dept. Of Interior announces campground expansion, improvements to meet increasing public demand for outdoor recreation'. An expansion of private options is only one possible reaction to the increasing demand. I would be happier if I was seeing public expansion as the solution."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,postrnut,2,Tue Jul 21 20:03:09 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Yeah, I too would love to see that headline in the news. I'm still amazed that we're not investing more in public infrastructure, conservation, and access.  Mostly, I wish we could expand Recreation.gov to be competitive with this new private expansion we're witnessing. Get rid of first-come-first-serve so that all public campsites can be viewed and booked online. I'd love to be able to jump on my phone on a Friday at work and grab a spot for that night up in Rocky Mountain National Park, without having to cross my fingers, burn gas, and hope for the best."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,whitecompass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:08:14 2015 UTC,"It takes folks like us raising our voices to get those kind of headlines. And that is part of the bummer of this experience. I worry that people, instead of raising a stink about the deteriorating public facilities, will just whip out their phones and use private options. This just weakens the whole public domain, not just in terms of usage, but in terms of possibilities and even what is considered the 'public' domain.   In my experience, there is usually a split between reservable and walk-up. I think a split is fair, not just for last minute arrivals, but also for the thousands of folks who road trip across America over the summer.   You are hitting a bureaucratic issue. I believe that the NPS is not as fully plugged into recreation.gov as BLM or NFS because it is its own administrative unit. Probably should be rationalized and work across the different units, but government. ;-) Again, not 100% sure."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,postrnut,2,Tue Jul 21 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed. One note about your private solutions comment is that profit, though obscenely prioritized in capitalism in general, can work as a viable method for landowners to preserve and manage their lands. Just from a landowner perspective. There will be those who seek only profit, and there will be those who seek to conserve and share their land. All about diversity and dispersion.  As an FYI, I work with LandApart listed in that article. It's really interesting to see these responses. All points that have been touched on but from different perspectives."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,shihonshugishi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:51:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But let's game out this a bit. If the solution to the increased demand is an expansion of private, for-profit campgrounds, what does that suggest for the future of public sites? Its not like an industry has ever used its market power to try to squash public entities competing. I don't like the idea of a private industry developing that has a vested interest in shrinking the public domain."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,postrnut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:24 2015 UTC,"I'm game! For one, I do not see private land approaching the majesty of most of the public lands that we as a people chose to protect. Tourism, International and Domestic, will continue to fill public lands. The exponential growth of the outdoor industry, compounded by new public land discovery services such as the Outbound Collective and Outdoor Project, will continue to fill the public land offerings with enthused travelers. What would you say is a viable way that private land could shrink the public domain?"
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,shihonshugishi,2,Tue Jul 21 20:27:06 2015 UTC,"Good catch. I should be clear. I don't think that private interests could necessarily claw back the most beautiful lands, and don't really think we will see public lands closed in the near term. But as has been discussed before, there has been much discussion in the Mountain West about returning current federal public lands to the states to be sold to the highest bidder.  I was thinking about shrinking the existing capacity of public agencies. And the shrinkage would be relative, in the failure of public agencies to keep up with demand, leading to a larger percentage of individuals using private options.   One mechanism: Private orgs, their trade groups, and their lobbyists could advocate against budget increases and capital projects on public land that would expand options and capacity. They could advocate against the creation of new public lands. I typically don't underestimate private profits desire to undermine the public interest if it helps increase margins."

CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,vauntedsexboat,7,Tue Jul 21 15:51:12 2015 UTC,"As a Californian, even places further away from major population centers can be a bit crowded, but you can mitigate this by making the right decisions. I went out around the Mono Lake area in the Eastern Sierras a couple weeks ago, and used a first-come-first-serve public campground (I would have gone dispersed, but I wanted a fire). Almost all of the reservation and non-reservation sites in the general vicinity were full of people (mostly RVs and large groups), but mine was sparsely populated because it was further away from the highway, and only accessible via unmaintained dirt road.     Basically my strategy these days, especially during busy summer months, is to maximize the barriers of entry to  where I want to camp. For the most part I feel like it does a good job of keeping me away from the homers and casuals that typically populate the most easily accessible camp spots."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,poguemahone69,4,Tue Jul 21 17:15:45 2015 UTC,"I always feel torn about this subject. On the one hand, I wish more people would avail themselves of the incredible natural areas located within just an hour or two of any part of the US.  On the other, I prefer being alone and people don't just spread out evenly, they tend to blow up a single location with hordes of people, even when there's equally amazing stuff right nearby.  A good example in my area is Ricketts Glen State Park vs. anything else in that area. Go to RGSP on a nice day and you're literally surrounded by people lots of places on the trails. Drive 45min over to Worlds End SP or Loyalsock SF and you're all alone.  For outdoor enthusiasts who want some solitude, this is great. From the point of view of the park administration, who need to justify their budget to upkeep the parks, I imagine it's awful."

I've driven over the pass in the middle of the night, mid week (wednesday), so that I could set up a lone tent and pay the site fee in advance, just so I can show back up on friday and have a spot.

CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,huffalump1,4,Tue Jul 21 19:46:23 2015 UTC,"Last summer, my brother and I took a road trip from the east coast out to the Great Lakes and Michigan. We tried to save money by camping when we could. We hit the gamut of camping options on our trip.   There was an awesome campground called Sleeping Bear Dunes but we were extremely lucky to get a spot. Nearly every campsite was spoken for, by what appeared to be people who were spending the whole summer there.   We stayed in a ""rustic"" campsite at one of those RV campgrounds which was basically a sandy lot of scrub pine with no facilities.   We spent another night at a state park just north of NYC on a Friday night, that was extremely crowded, and pitched our tent in the middle the equivalent of a night long frat party. On the other hand, we hit another NY state park earlier in the trip, on a weeknight, and it was almost ideal.  We are heading on another trip next week, heading down to the Louisiana coast, and I suspect we will experience more of the same. There's really no way of knowing what you're going to be getting until you actually get to the campsite. You can't trust online reviews, because the RV campground I mentioned got high marks despite being basically a shithole."

Secluded locations closer to population centers can offer easier access to more spontaneous camping experiences, and increase the overall amount of time spent outdoors which serves as a great benefit to society in general. Especially as migrations to the city increase. Furthermore, more remote locations such as BLM or Wilderness areas are fantastic and mostly what I enjoy personally. However, there is a barrier to entry for some in these more remote lands as there is limited reservation, poor discovery mechanisms, and they may be deterred by their perceived lack of supreme outdoor knowledge."

Perhaps a better way to say it public land management and access can be made easier and at no cost/low cost, for an example see the US mid-atlantic region.  A further example would be Pennsylvania (of all places) that has a world class trail network located on their public land, along with hunter access, ATV usage, resource extraction, et al that seems to work pretty well.  I honestly can't understand why western states like Washington that have huge tracts of public land can't make it easier for the public to access it, but there's local history and resource management issues that I don't know about."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Almostcomatose,3,Tue Jul 21 17:54:31 2015 UTC,"Our (WA) budget for the forest service is tiny. Its a shame really. They just dont have the resources to make that happen and the ""no taxes for any reason"" crowd will shout down any extra funding they try and send forth. I think this is probably why the camp sites are so expensive. They need revenue to keep these things going. Its an unfortunate situation and I hope we can figure it out because the public access to the wilderness is extremely important for conservation. People don't understand that they are losing so much when they sell off these public lands.   Compare it to zoo's. I would prefer we didn't have animals in cages, like I would prefer the woods to stay elusive and pristine, but that easy access provides awareness, which in turn benefits the whole system. We need to find a way to get people to appreciate the wild, by harnessing its beauty and showing them that the wild is something to be treasured.

CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,mharriger,5,Tue Jul 21 20:57:28 2015 UTC,"I see a big value of this being NOT in the west, where public land is plentiful, but instead the Midwest and great plains, where there is so little public land (like less than 2% of Iowa and that includes a military ammo plant and also lakes).  There are plenty of private conservationists who would host campers if they were connected to them.   This would pretty logically dovetail with hunting rentals as well. Control the types of campers, when they camp, and squeeze a little more mine out of your protected land."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,shihonshugishi,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. I live in eastern Nebraska, and we desperately need more places to get outside. Although I'd rather see more places to hike than more developed campgrounds."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,iowajaycee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:24 2015 UTC,"Agree here. Having a network of private land across America in areas underserved by public land is definitely a great goal. The unique problem in reaching landowners is that they are mostly quite rural and less merged with tech, so takes a lot of word of mouth to reach them."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,mrjowee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:33:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed, hiking in prairie land is in a sad state.  But ""developed campground"" could mean a clearing in a wilderness-y part of a property that has been cleared of poison ivy and has a small fire ring, with the real value being the 8 mile hike to get there."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,arthurpete,7,Tue Jul 21 20:51:05 2015 UTC,"I don't go car camping expecting solitude, but the few state parks around here have become insanely over crowded. A new park was opened maybe 5 years ago, and it's already packed on any given weekend. The last few times I've gone you could have counted the number of tents on one hand (I was in the only hammock). There's nothing like reconnecting with nature in front of a 50"" plasma screen mounted on the outside of an RV."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Almostcomatose,15,Tue Jul 21 17:01:58 2015 UTC,"""Glamping"" as my friend likes to call it, has ruined the camping scene. Every campground nowadays seems to be more geared towards Rv'ing than traditional campers."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,red8reader,20,Tue Jul 21 15:26:37 2015 UTC,"Please. Your friend is full of it. Does he go into the mountains with nothing but a knife and survive? I doubt it. Its all camping. Having a nice bed to sleep in doesn't lessen the experience of being outdoors. I car camp, I motor home camp, and I back country camp. All of them are fun. They are all on the spectrum of camping. There is no sense in playing this whole ""that's not real camping"" game. Bringing $2k worth of high tech gear into the backwoods is no more rugged than parking a motor home next to a lake. Don't kid yourself. Were not out there to build a cabin from scratch. Were out there to enjoy the fresh air, and the wildlife, and the scenery. Should my grandparents be denied the right to enjoy nature because they use a camper? Sitting around a fire, in the woods, talking and looking at the stars, that's camping. Doesn't matter what form of bed you sleep in that night."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,arthurpete,20,Tue Jul 21 17:27:11 2015 UTC,"I hear what you're saying - however, those who tend to tent camp don't bring along their generators or have a flat screen TV that can be turned from the inside of the RV and point to the outside of the RV so everyone has to hear it. However there are the few that will bring an A/C unit with them tent camping - very few.   Camping is different to everyone. Mixing all the campers in one area is a poor way to manage.   I like the move of segregation of some of the parts that keep tent camping and RV's somewhat segregated and those camp ground that have natural barriers between sites."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Almostcomatose,3,Tue Jul 21 17:41:47 2015 UTC,"I agree that segregation is a good thing overall. But, some of the newer parks that i have been to that have done this have segregated the car campers to the lower quality areas which include the lower quality amenities, views etc. You cant necessarily blame the management for doing this either as typically RVers probably tend to spend more in the gift shop, have higher expectations in park amenities/services, etc etc."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,red8reader,2,Tue Jul 21 18:44:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah that sucks, and honestly I probably wouldn't want to go camping there, but you've got to have an idea of what sort of camping this is if there is a gift shop in the campground."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Almostcomatose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:42 2015 UTC,Great point and kinda sad.
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Sloppy_Twat,2,Tue Jul 21 19:37:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I hear ya, but you should know going into it that if you are camping in an RV campground, there are going to be RV's. I do A LOT of camping and very rarely do you encounter these TV people. And honestly, when I go motor home camping, I just go with different expectations. I'm there for a different reason. How could I complain about someones TV when my boat is tied up waiting to be taken out for some wakeboarding? None of us are here ""roughing"" it.   It gets into the low 100's nonstop in eastern Washington in the summer. Hell yeah I'm bringing an AC. I didn't go there with the expectation to be roughing it anyway. Hell, my wave runner is down on the beach waiting for me to take a ride. Its just a different thing. Car camping is not roughing it. It never has been, even when I think back to when I was a kid going camping in campgrounds. We'd bring our bikes and pool floaties to swim, my parents would bust out the margaritas and we'd all have a good time. That's all that nature needs to be. It's there so you can go out and enjoy it in your own way."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Almostcomatose,4,Tue Jul 21 18:15:13 2015 UTC,The rvs crowds will pretty much be geared to wealthy citizens and tent camping is for everyone.  That is the difference when you have a small percentage of people(rv'ers) can encroach on the peacefulness of majority of people tent camping. The same way people don't want people partying and getting drunk/loud in the camp area is the same reason people don't want to hear loud genertors and football games blaring from some rv. Honestly it sucks to just hear the big diesel engines crank up at 5:00 in the morning and that doesn't include air brake noises and doors slamming shut.  I thin there should be more separation on the physical location of rvs and tent and there should be more of a seperation in price for rvs and tents. The rv'er will almost always be more draining on the parks resources than tent campers.
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,red8reader,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:34 2015 UTC,"there should be more of a separation in price for rvs and tents   There usually is, although its not that much. Maybe 18 compared to 25. How much do electricity and sewer hook ups really cost though? Most of your site fee is just general operation costs. I agree with the separation of rv's and tents, but really, if you want seclusion what good is it to go somewhere where a bunch of people are doing the same thing? You want seclusion, go somewhere that offers that. Don't go to a 50 site campground if you don't want to see/hear other people."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Almostcomatose,4,Tue Jul 21 18:55:03 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're trying to make a case that a backpacker, car camper and RV'er should just deal with the RV'ers and all their toys.   Nature means different things to different people. There needs to be a way that each type can achieve what they believe nature to be. Rounding up all campers as glampers is too simplistic a way to think about the situation.   The other thought is that if we don't provide the proper atmosphere for each type of camper then more of them will do dispersed camping. If prices get to high then they will do more dispersed camping. Here in OR and up in WA I see many dispersed camping sites trashed by individuals (car and RV campers mainly due to the easy access) that should have went to a camp ground to where they can have those simple amenities that will take care of their waste.   Campground are a way to isolate the damage to a larger portion of the environment.   There is a better way to please more of the people. Opening it up to private land camping might be a start - some will cater to RV's, some to cars, other to backpackers. There could be a better solution provided by the states besides more regulations and more crowded campsites."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,arthurpete,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:45:54 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're trying to make a case that a backpacker, car camper and RV'er should just deal with the RV'ers and all their toys.   If you are in a place where all those things are allowed, yes, you should deal with it. It is that kind of campground. To me, having done a wide variety of backpacking/car camping/RV'ing, it doesn't even make sense to go to a place where you know there is the potential for loud groups, and then complain about the large groups. That just seems crazy to me. Maybe people don't realize that it is possible to go camping in places that are secluded? They think these are the only sites? Idk. Here in Washington there are a million spots along rivers and lakes, even just up forest service roads, that are amazing secluded camp sites. If a campground has 50 RV spaces, 100 tent sites, a boat launch and a dedicated store, what do people think they are getting into in the first place?   I agree we need like a billion more campsites, but that's a government funding issue. Private sites could begin to do that, that'd be cool. It would help take the strain off the public ones."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Almostcomatose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:01:05 2015 UTC,"That wasnt my friend that said that, he just calls it that, in fact he would be a ""glamper"" himself. The sentiment is entirely mine and there is a lot of grey area in the survivalist enjoyment of the woods and the glamper scene, so reaching for polarities wont help you frame this discussion.  I think the whole point of getting into nature is to experience nature, not to experience the luxuries of modern life with a nice view. Its hard to truly appreciate your surroundings with all the modern distractions, whether that be your iphone you use as a gps/camera while backpacking or the new flat screen in the camper. So yes, in my opinion, the greater the luxury the less nature you are actually experiencing. I say this from experience as I have camped in a multitude of ways and the more i am immersed in nature the greater my experience tends to be.  I think if we start accommodating these luxuries then we will begin to lose our connections to the environment around us. If we lose these connections we will probably lose some of the empathy for these places that have stood to protect them."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,arthurpete,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:37:03 2015 UTC,"So do you go into the woods with nothing but a knife? Or do you bring along what is essentially all the comforts of home, a bed, food to cook, tents to sleep in, Lights to see in the dark. Being in a campground is not like camping in the back country. It is not meant to be some kind of survivor man exposure to the wild. There are other options for that if that is what you want.   You cant apply your own subjective experience of being in the wild and then tell other people that their experience is less valid because you feel like it is. Some people simply don't want to rough it. My sister thinks car camping is roughing it. Its a spectrum. There are places that cater to campers all along that spectrum. If you are camping in a place with RV hook ups, you should not go into it expecting complete seclusion. You want that, go hike and throw a tent somewhere.   If I want to go camping in the motor home and party, I go to Lake Chelan with the college kids. If I want to have a less rowdy time, still among RV's I go car camping at Verlot in the cascades, if I want absolute seclusion and immersion into the wild, I pack my backpack and take to the mountains. Im not going to play the ""no true camper"" game of telling people how they should be enjoying the outdoors.   EDIT: So do you go with just a knife? Is your experience lessened because you have a tent?"
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Almostcomatose,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:58 2015 UTC,"lol, you are still reaching for the extreme here. The context (or at least the post you responded to of mine) has been about traditional camping vs Rv'ing. You blabbering on about survivorman and nothing but knives in the woods is irrelevant to the discussion. If you need to, go back and read what you responded to initially. Furthermore i purposefully used the terms ""in my opinion"" and ""i think"" as i know full well that my personal experience doesnt reflect everyone elses."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,arthurpete,0,Tue Jul 21 19:09:48 2015 UTC,"Furthermore i purposefully used the terms ""in my opinion"" and ""i think"" as i know full well that my personal experience doesnt reflect everyone elses.   Really? Was it you that said this?   ""Glamping"" as my friend likes to call it, has ruined the camping scene.   What I'm trying to say, is that glamping is a form of camping. My ""blabbering"" was there to illustrate the original point, that glamping is camping. That camping isn't defined by how many creature comforts you bring along with you. It may be irrelevant to a discussion you are having with yourself, but to the discussion that we are actually engaged in, whether creature comforts lessen the experience of camping, it is entirely relevant. (see we can both be passive aggressive, I'd rather just get along)   I'd be curious as to what kind of situation you find yourself in where you reserve a campsite among 50 others campers, in which you know there will be RV's, and then upon arrival you get upset that people are there camping in RV's? I agree that for you, and me, the more secluded we are the better the experience, but there are places that offer that, and there are places that offer the RV's somewhere to go. You seem to be just camping in the wrong places for the kind of expectations you have."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,sheriff1980,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:33 2015 UTC,"I wonder if that's due to general laziness by everyone and greed by the campsite hosts, or that the newer generations are less interested in camping and therefore the older folks with their RVs and campers are just flooding the market?"
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,RipkenDoublePlay,10,Tue Jul 21 15:42:06 2015 UTC,"The campground hosts are usually retirees who may work for reduced or free ""rent""....dont fault them.  Moreso, I think the RV folks bring in more disposable income so there is pressure on local/state parks to make accommodations for them. The pressure is probably coming from government officials looking for ways to generate additional tax revenue."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Ethanol_Based_Life,3,Tue Jul 21 16:31:09 2015 UTC,"Ah, I misspoke using the term 'hosts.' I guess I meant 'owners' (concessionaires, agencies, officials, etc)."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,arthurpete,8,Tue Jul 21 16:37:21 2015 UTC,"When I was a kid my parents used to take us camping all the time, we would set up our tents and sleep on the ground and have a great time. After many years my father just couldn't handle the packing, unpacking, and setting everything up without our help. Then getting down on the ground to sleep, He upgraded to an air mattress but that still got uncomfortable. It is just he and my mother now that my brother and I have moved to other states. He bought an RV, he has everything he needs in it ready to go whenever he wants, he can now enjoy being outdoors again. 30 years of sleeping on the ground every weekend took its toll. He is far from lazy. He worked his ass off to have what he does and has earned the right to sleep in a camper. He is almost 70 now, and still gets to enjoy the outdoors, he and his retired friends often go ""circle the wagons"" setting up 8 or 9 campers and have a great time. Even then, every couple of months they will break out the canvas wall tents, and the teepees, and do this for a week http://imgur.com/WdORvQw To call any of them lazy would get you laughed out of camp."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,nixfu,3,Tue Jul 21 16:02:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think they were insinuating that older people with RV's are lazy. I believe they meant people like my girlfriends mother who refuses to go ""camping"" unless she has all the comforts of home."

CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,moccasinspaws,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:01 2015 UTC,I never said glampers themselves have ruined the scene. Its more so the parks in general ruining the scene by being more accommodating to RV'ers than general car campers. Intermingling the two groups or moving the car campers to less desirable spots within the park to make way for RV'ers is a management issue. I dont think anybody in their right mind wants to car camp next to an RV who runs their generator/AC nonstop...is that really snobish?   I see this accommodation towards RVers much more prevalent in the south than i do anywhere else.
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Vandilbg,2,Tue Jul 21 20:47:20 2015 UTC,"Always stay in the ""primitive"" camping area, away from all the RVers."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,shihonshugishi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:58:51 2015 UTC,"There are 6 campgrounds within 3 hours of my home. One has been closed for about three years. Another has a primitive area that is little more than an open field, and still close enough to hear the nightlong drone of RV's.The newest park (which has tubing/kayaking and a small river beach) has no primitive or tent-only area. Another is situated on a lake that is frequented by boats and jet skis. Again, there's no primitive camping, so you have boat noises during the day followed by RV noises at night. Fun.  One that some friends of mine frequent is 45 minutes from a major city. It has a primitive area... filled with RV's and pop up campers. Many of the sites are right on top of one another, some with few trees between them. It doesn't feel like your in the woods, but rather sleeping on the side of the road. Pretty lame (some of the sites are an exception).  There is one that has a truly primitive area that RV's and pop-ups can't get to, in a nice secluded woodlands, complete with 25+ miles of hiking trails through a national forest (so backpacking is allowed as well). It's only like $7 a night."
CampingandHiking,3e2mtc,Vandilbg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:35 2015 UTC,"I agree. Unfortunately the wife much prefers the idea of being closer to the bathhouse style restrooms than the pit toilets...we have kids, girls at that.

CampingandHiking,3dz9so,kiwican,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:57:31 2015 UTC,"Ya sort of. The fog zone is usually the last place for the fire ban to apply to and the first area where it is lifted, but sometimes there is a true provincial fire ban and no fires are allowed anywhere at all."
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,TotallyOffTopic_,0,Tue Jul 21 17:27:10 2015 UTC,I don't think it is this year.
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,Dwellonthis,3,Tue Jul 21 08:05:31 2015 UTC,"The ban there recently got lifted. But for most of the summer, yes there has been a ban in the fog zone."
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,kiwican,10,Tue Jul 21 14:10:40 2015 UTC,"Come on, can't we assume OP did this hike and took this photo before the fireban was in effect? And just got around to posting it now?? (OP plz... tell me this is true) Although either way it is a pretty huge fire."
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,zh3nya,0,Mon Jul 20 22:50:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, though even without a ban, this is totally gratuitous. If you truly believe this is one of the ""most beautiful places on earth"" why would you despoil its beauty with a giant bonfire? Just make a normal campfire, it will warm you up if you're cold and satisfy your it-ain't-campin'-if-there-ain't-a-fire urges. This is just a classless burning of shit."
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,cwcoleman,-6,Tue Jul 21 17:10:04 2015 UTC,still - burning / gathering driftwood is illegal on most (all?) beaches in Washington State.
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,kiwican,7,Tue Jul 21 01:04:10 2015 UTC,"West Coast Trail is in BC, not Washington State :)"
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,cwcoleman,-3,Tue Jul 21 01:07:05 2015 UTC,"ah, true - I always forget it is just across the border. If not illegal there - it is very frowned upon. I've hiked on both sides of the border."
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,LeftHandedOctopus,12,Tue Jul 21 01:10:47 2015 UTC,"From the 2015 Pacific Rim National Park Reserve Guidebook:   Use a stove and minimize fires. Do not rely on fires for cooking, staying warm or drying out. Small driftwood fires are permitted below the high tide line on beaches: fires are not permitted in the forest. Use only driftwood (no thicker than your wrist): do not cut vegetation, trees or other plants, and keep fires away from beach logs. Make sure fires have burned out, or are extinguished with water, and dismantled. No trace of the fire should be left.     Nobody much minds someone burning driftwood. A monster fire that is much larger than necessary and perhaps depleted the firewood supply for successive hikers is probably in poor taste, though."
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,jaird30,6,Tue Jul 21 03:53:01 2015 UTC,They tell you to use driftwood in the orientation if I'm remembering right. Cutting down trees is frowned upon.
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,cwcoleman,3,Tue Jul 21 03:02:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, OP confirmed this. In specific areas where the driftwood is more abundant this is the case. I was thinking about the other places I've been - where there are signs specifically protecting the driftwood from collection and burning. (obviously during a burn ban it's a whole other situation)."
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,thefightforgood,3,Tue Jul 21 03:12:15 2015 UTC,No. Olympic National Park you're only allowed to burn driftwood on the beach.
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,flouride,4,Tue Jul 21 01:19:51 2015 UTC,Not right now. The burn ban includes anything of the sort.
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,cwcoleman,-2,Tue Jul 21 01:24:58 2015 UTC,"true, so not all beaches. Still a burn ban for the past month, even for driftwood."

CampingandHiking,3dz9so,cptcronic,26,Tue Jul 21 03:54:23 2015 UTC,You seriously built a fire that big when as much of BC is on fire as it is...
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,cwcoleman,7,Mon Jul 20 20:42:13 2015 UTC,"Made with driftwood on the beach just feet away from the tide?  I don't see a problem here.  What are they gonna catch on fire, the sand?"
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,The_Rusty_Taco,3,Tue Jul 21 00:21:32 2015 UTC,burning driftwood makes it worse. it's a big no-no
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,cwcoleman,4,Tue Jul 21 01:02:00 2015 UTC,Why?
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,hegbork,10,Tue Jul 21 01:11:31 2015 UTC,"They smoke terribly I think is the main reason for the burn ban. The drift wood also adds to the environment of the beaches (for animals and such) - so it is protected. That's the main reason both burning and gathering is illegal (in most, not all, places). I'm not an expert - just seen the signs along our WA/OR beaches."
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,TotallyOffTopic_,20,Tue Jul 21 01:17:55 2015 UTC,"In the trail orientation from Parks Canada on that particular trail they stress that the only wood you're allowed to burn is driftwood. So maybe where you happen to live someone has a problem with in, on this particular trail in the picture it's perfectly allowed. A big part of the trail orientation is about how to make fires."
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,Hubology,5,Tue Jul 21 05:05:26 2015 UTC,The fire ban is because it hasn't rained in months.
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,cptcronic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:06:36 2015 UTC,"In BC it's mostly fine, there's a fair bit of logging so cleaning up the beaches is necessary. And burning next to the forest the carbon will be reabsorbed. The sparking is the problem, we don't need more forest fires."
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,cwcoleman,2,Tue Jul 21 16:26:27 2015 UTC,That is a ridiculous sentiment.  Care to explain the logic behind it?
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,cptcronic,11,Tue Jul 21 02:08:56 2015 UTC,"Driftwood is a very unique item. It takes a long time to create and many animals and plants on the beaches rely on it for life. If everyone burned it, on certain beaches, it would seriously affect the environment. Other beaches - the wood is super abundant - so it isn't as big of a deal. The visual part of driftwood is also something to consider. If a few backpackers burn it all up, there is none for others to enjoy - since it's not replaced like normal deadwood in a forrest situation.        The majority, not all, of beaches in WA/OR have laws against collecting and burning it. Other states in the US have similar rules. I'm not sure about BC.             Burning creates massive smoke. With a fire as big as OP's - you would be able to see it for miles. Some sources also say it contains chemicals - but I've never seen that warning in person."
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,hegbork,8,Tue Jul 21 02:22:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you, you make a lot of good points.  I suppose if there is a small or limited amount of driftwood on the beach I would agree that it shouldn't be burned."
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,mountainslayer,4,Tue Jul 21 03:14:30 2015 UTC,"There's no problem with driftwood replenishing on those beaches. There's a few driftwood fires on every beach on that trail every night for the whole season and after decades of the trail being active it hasn't ran out of driftwood yet. Because new crap drifts in every winter.  There's no problem with smoke either, actually, having experienced many fires on WCT and outside, I'd say the driftwood fires on WCT are a little less smoky than other fires I've built. And the cedar smells good."
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,mr_canoehead,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:15:08 2015 UTC,The west coast of Vancouver Island collects MASSIVE amounts of driftwood every winter.  It's not a problem.
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,Hubology,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:37:00 2015 UTC,The biggest argument against burning driftwood is that it produces a lot of carcinogenic dioxins because of the salts in the wood. You don't want to breathe that smoke.
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,sprashoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:01:20 2015 UTC,"Normally it's fine, but the forests are really dry right now. Driftwood tends to pop and spark. It only takes one."
CampingandHiking,3dz9so,Hubology,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:22:53 2015 UTC,"Sparks can drift into the forest. I just finished the West Coast Trail and people were making fires close to the tree line as well, despite the ban. It was pretty infuriating. We tried telling them but nobody was interested. They either played dumb about knowing about the ban or pointed to other people with fires and said ""but they're doing it"". In the end we could not convince a single party to put out their illegal fires. :("

Beautiful gorgeous mostly sunny day with slight wind.  I think the strongest gust was ~15mph on Mt. Madison.  Started at the trail head (valley way -> watson)around 5am and made the decision with my hiking partner around 1pm(?) to end it at Mt. Washington.  We had maintained a 2-3mph pace until Jefferson, then between the both of us running injuries of past had presented and caused us to slow down the pace.  I barely saw anyone until the Madison Hut, then it was hit and miss.. either desolation of a dozen yelling boy scouts.  I felt pretty naked without my binoculars and magnifying glass, but even so it was a spectacular day for animals and plants.  I've only been to Mt. Washington in 20F and -40F, so it was quite... and experience.  Its amazing how rude people can be to some of the AT thru hikers/hikers up there at the MW Obs buildings. I guess people need to shove into line to get pictures after driving uphill for 15 minutes. Once I get over my plantar fasciitis I'll tackle the southern half S -> N and try again next summer.  I'm def gonna try Madison/Adams in the winter if I can find people to go with."

CampingandHiking,3dy5be,brtl,4,Mon Jul 20 14:20:10 2015 UTC,I've been a rabid New England hiker (mostly winter) for the last 7 years and just moved to Sweden. Where's the best place to start (1-nighters) and how do I get there from Stockholm?
CampingandHiking,3dy5be,Ethanol_Based_Life,5,Mon Jul 20 18:30:46 2015 UTC,"Sadly, doing a 1-nighter in the Swedish mountains would most likely mean you're spending most of your trip getting there and back if you're coming from Stockholm.   Good news is though, there's lots of hiking trails around Stockholm like Roslagsleden, Bergslagsleden or Sörmlandsleden if you want to do 1-nighters that are closer by. You can even get to Sörmlandsleden through the commuter rail system.   I think the most southern actual fell is in northern Dalarna, getting there would be a 4+ hours by train or bus."
CampingandHiking,3dy5be,Papper,3,Mon Jul 20 18:51:33 2015 UTC,Oh. 4 hrs is no big deal.
CampingandHiking,3dy5be,Ethanol_Based_Life,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"I think your best bet would be the area around Idre, it's 5,5 hours by car or just over 7 hours by train+bus. In the area you have Städjan, Fulufjällets Nationalpark, Grövelsjön and a bunch of other stuff. You could look at Sälen as well I think, it's (a tiny bit) further south but I think it's mostly just skilifts and not really any real fells. An other option could be southern Härjedalen (Sonfjällets Nationalpark, 7 hour drive from Stockholm), but getting there takes even longer."

The maps on trail, at the campsites nearby, show a trail connecting Mt Beatty to the Great Divide Trail. This was the basis of my trip, I went to the South Kananaskis Pass and saw the map connecting it to the North Pass through British Columbia.  However, I can find no reference to this hike online, nor is it on my map.  Am I crazy leading 3 friends, experienced hikers, on this trip if I can not find the actual trail anywhere?  Worst case is we follow a creek downhill for an hour.  I am not that worried.  But should I be?  I have never gone off trail like this before.  I am used to trail finding and avoiding deadfall though.  I expect day 2 to take at least 25% longer than usual and that there will be a higher chance of bumping into wildlife.  That portion of the Great Divide Trail is not supposed to be maintained until September apparently."
CampingandHiking,3e2zq6,mountainslayer,3,Tue Jul 21 15:48:06 2015 UTC,I prefer the Sawyer squeeze because I can set it up in so many different ways. It can be used by attaching a dirty water bag or by attaching it to a water bottle. There is also the option to put it inline on your hydration bladder or make it into a gravity system. I feel that with the Sawyer I have way more options than I would get with a dedicated gravity filter or pump.
CampingandHiking,3e2zq6,MotoFox,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:01 2015 UTC,I have both (Sawyer & MSR miniworks) but I haven't used the pump once since I got the gravity filter. It's less work and really convenient to have 'running water' from the gravity filter for things like washing dishes/hands. Maintenance has also been easier.   The only advantage I've noticed for the pump is that you can get water out of smaller / more difficult water sources like puddles.
CampingandHiking,3e2zq6,ronny_reagan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:31 2015 UTC,"I use an MSR gravity works and am pretty happy with it.  It's particularly useful to me because my father and I both use water bladders for our water.  I've added a Source-compatible QD to the gravity filter output tube and am able to fill the bladders without removing them from the packs.  Just hang the gravity bag on a tree and put the bag on the ground, hooking up the output direct to the drinking tube QD."
CampingandHiking,3e2zq6,SoldierOnce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:24 2015 UTC,"I will stick with my MSR sweetwater pump.  To fill a gravity bag you need to really get down near the water to fill.  Often times this can be dangerous, falling in fast water, or can be a pain, steep sides, or stir up silt, shallow water entrance, or the creek is not deep enough.  With my pump, I can just sit down, toss out the pickup line and start pumping.  The sweetwater requires little force compared to others, and if you pump to hard there is a pressure reject valve.  I can attach it direct to my camelpak to fill without removing the bladder, and it has a nifty lid thing that fits to most sized water bottles, most importantly nalgene sized.  I don't need to find some way to suspend the dirtywater bag.  It much less to mess with the pump and its not that big, fits  perfectly in my external pouch."

The 12 person per party rule ostensibly functions to discourage people who show up more out of an affiliation towards a group than out of their appreciation of/for nature--when sororities/frats/ churchgoers/schoolchildren (etc.) show up in swarms, they largely rely on the ""expertise"" of their guide organizer, and poor uninformed decisions get made. In this case, the ""large group"" was assembled to congratulate a man for a truly remarkable feat.   In the case of littering... give me a break. As has already been pointed out, nowhere does any statute regarding the term ""littering"" mention potable liquid. This is an obvious reach. A crotchety petty tyrant is inflicting his limited mandate upon people with whom he takes umbrage."
CampingandHiking,3e0dni,ShadyPachyderm,17,Tue Jul 21 18:03:18 2015 UTC,So now hiking with a group larger than 12 people and letting liquid hit the ground are crimes? What a world we live in...  It seems like someone had it out for the guy for some reason.

I don't mind him being fined for doing what he did wrong, but the charges are kind of rediculous.  I've never ever heard of liquid being considered litter, and checking Maine's statutes on litter, they only address solids, not liquids.  If the guy dropped a wrapper, or the cork flew off and he didn't pick it up, I'd agree that it's littering.  With a liquid though, there's no way to even pick it up after it's dropped, so how can it be litter? Are the park rangers fining hikers who spill their electrolyte drink too?"
CampingandHiking,3e0dni,hangingfrog,4,Tue Jul 21 01:38:48 2015 UTC,I agree it is ticky-tack to say the least. My best guess is that it is some arcane law used to hassle people when you are looking for a reason to hassle.

Take a frozen burger patty right before you leave your house and lay on a double or triple layer of tin foil. Put on any toppings that you may want-ketchup, mustard, cheese, mushrooms, pickle....anything. Wrap it up in the tin foil and by the time you make camp and start a fire the burger is usually thawed out. Lay the burger (wrapped in tin foil) on the coals at the edge of the fire until cooked. Delicious every time. Note: you definitely want multiple layers of tin foil because in the process of flipping the outer layer will usually puncture or rip."

The problem I came across was that while I was screwing in the stove gas would be released heavily between the stove and the fuel, before the rubber o ring could even block it. Have you encountered this problem before?  Update: I seriously appreciate all of the replies! I figured I would give it one more try since it appeared to be common trait in working stoves. All I did was screw the stove into the the fuel without applying any pressure to help secure the stove. This allowed the stove to screw the o-ring closer to the seal on the fuel before the pin on the stove could open the fuel source. There was some hissing, but minimal leakage. I now feel comfortable taking this setup on a trip and don't have to buy more fuel just to encounter the same problem! Thank you!"

We saw a lot of evidence of bears but no sightings. Actually, we saw just one deer and a few snakes. Many nice pit toilets along the way.

Lots of snow (like 10+ feet)? Lots of cold (like 0F temps)? Popular or secluded (near airports, drive to with 2wd vehicles)? Do you have a flexible schedule (weather often makes certain routes unmanageable for days/weeks at a time)? Do you have the gear or will you plan to rent on site? Will you be solo or looking for an outfitter?... which brings me to my next section...      Do you have winter skills? Avalanche training first comes to mind. It is a serious threat to life. A large dump of snow looks fun to uneducated - it looks like a hazard to experienced backcountry hikers. Reading the snowpack and understanding risks (above and below) as you traverse any trail is critical in snowy winter environments. Going out alone is generally a bad idea, even on the lowest of risk days."

CampingandHiking,3dz125,goofoffering,2,Mon Jul 20 18:07:53 2015 UTC,I just went to the doctor for a rash a little over a week ago. My rash didn't start out as a bullseye (I thought it was spider) but it turned into a big one. I only ended up going to to the doctor because I was getting muscle soreness and joint soreness near the bite.  They put me on antibiotics and I think we caught it soon enough that it didn't turn into a big deal. I never got flu-like symptoms or anything just general tiredness and the muscle and joint pain. My rash is clearing up now and I feel fine.

CampingandHiking,3dysj8,nymibo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:09:20 2015 UTC,"You are on the right track. One major piece of planning any hike is transportation.       There are a variety of answers...      Single Personal Vehicle - take your own car and park at the trailhead. This requires a loop style hike, so you end up at the same place you started. Most popular and easy. Two Personal Vehicles - take 2 cars. park 1 at the start, park the 2nd at the end. Requires some up-front work to stage the 2nd vehicle, 2 drivers, and extra gas. Allows hiking of a straight section, no loop or backtracking required. Public Shuttle - pay a service to drive you to X location, then come pick you up at the same spot, or else-wear on X date. Expensive and service area is limited. Convenient for non-drivers but not always available where needed. Rental - take a Hertz rent-a-car to the trail. Public Transport - some cities are close enough to send buses deep into the mountains. Rare and they take forever. Hitchhike - stick out your thumb and ask for a ride from a stranger. Popular among hikers. It's mostly free, yet slightly risky. May take a long time (or never) depending on location and time of year. Rideshare - posting on public forums to find others headed in the same direction. Meetup in public spots and drive to the mountains together.   Or some combination of these methods. You could take public bus as far as it will take you, then hitchhike from there (although getting back out could be problematic if not in a populated area). Yes - there are often shuttles, but finding ones in your area is the hard part. Maybe someone else here knows of a service, but I don't. I've hiked this section before - never seen a shuttle. It seems like you've planned in reverse. I would normally expect transportation to be more important than choosing the section of trail. How did you come up with this trip guide? If you have no way to get there - you can't do it. Instead - you should choose what type of transportation you have available - and based on that - choose a trail within that area which you can backpack. If you have unlimited funds - I'm sure you could convince a taxi service to take you (and pick you up maybe) - but that sounds super expensive to me."
CampingandHiking,3dysj8,cwcoleman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:37:04 2015 UTC,"The Appalachian Trail Conservancy maintains an AT shuttle list on their Parking, Shuttles & Transportation page.

I did a similar hike a couple of years ago, and used Mike Evans (Mobile Mike’s Shuttles and More) for a ride from the airport and then a first night at his hostel, which is right there at Chester Gap where you're planning on parking your car.  You're probably better off parking your car right there at his hostel, actually.  It'd be safer than at the little parking by the trail crossing."

CampingandHiking,3dxfuh,redhousebythebog,3,Mon Jul 20 13:26:09 2015 UTC,"I've been into motorbike camping for a very long time. Mostly with road bikes that I beat up taking off road when I get to the getting to place. The  2nd and 3rd links don't work for me, possibly due to being in the US. I can say that I use a Jetboil. the cannisters are pretty universal fits over here in the states, and one cannister of fuel lasts me a very very long time. I also use a fire and tinfoil for most of my cooking, and only use the jet boil for coffee and boiling water.        as for a table, I don't see a reason for one.  There is always a flat rock or stump around. to me, the space on my bike is more valuable than the convenience of a table.        as for tarp. invest in a good durable tarp. it's worth the packing space/weight. bring stakes for the tarp, paracord, and use bungees to secure the tarp to your motorcycle. use it like a lean-to. like so. https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/09/aa/1f/09aa1f47b8524d09881d303dac8b1e9f.jpg        I prefer my tarp to be larger so that it can cover the far side of the bike completely.   if you can, you'll want the floor of the tarp to be under the roof of the tarp. so stake out the roof of the tarp beyond the flooring.  if it rains, you dont' want rain to collect on the floor and seep under the bike to your clothing etc...   edit i found a pic of my old bike with the tarp set up. having a tall sissy bar helped with headroom. in this picture I used two tarps and didn't have one large enough to cover the far side of the bike all the way, but it did rain, and I did stay nice and dry despite the massive 'entry way'.   http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6kgktqjkB1r6222bo1_1280.jpg"
CampingandHiking,3dxfuh,DeadSeaGulls,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:42:04 2015 UTC,"our setups are crazy different.  I use a tent ect but i'm looking at getting a tarp to use as a wind shelter or cover from the rain when it does. Also, i don't trust tieing a tarp to my motorcycle at all, the last thing i want is for the wind to catch it and tip over my motorcycle.  Also, i'm too scared to make a fire. I only carry like 2L of water on me (i'll increase this when i go to hard luggage and i can pack 5L of water onto the panniers.) and it might not be enough to put out a fire and if it starts to spread i could lose my motorcycle and be liable for starting a bushfire. My boss says that you should dig a hole and light the fire in that and when you're done put the dirt ontop of the fire and pour water ontop"
CampingandHiking,3dxfuh,DeadSeaGulls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:16:02 2015 UTC,"I usually bring a tent along.  I do the dirt hole fire. I'm out in Utah on the edge of the great basin, which is just a big ol' desert. Out here you can find water if you study maps. Sometimes you have to dig down into a dried river/spring bed and there will be water a foot down or so. Might be a much greater concern out there. as for wind and the motorbike, depends on how much your bike leans on the kick stand.  in my scenario the bungee's/pegs will give way before the bike could be pushed against its lean.  And you'd have plenty of warning leading up to that point."
CampingandHiking,3dxfuh,talldean,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:05:56 2015 UTC,"(Your links to the two connectors point at images that aren't available from my computer; I think the links are bad.)  If you're going on a trip where you won't be able to easily get new things, avoid knockoff stoves.  In the US, you can get the 1 lb propane cylinders (LP) cheaply at any large store and most small ones, those work well here.  (Because they're easy to find new ones, and the stove is unbreakably simple; mine's being going 15 years, and it may have rusted in the 90's.)  If you're short on space, consider cooking on the ground, or if your bike has a center stand, it's at least level?  :-)  You can use the walking poles if you want.  For the type of pole you want, lookup ""replacement tent center pole""; the ""center pole"" is one meant to not bend much.  Alternatively, just use the motorcycle as the ""tree"".  Have a plan to have some tarp under you, in a way where water goes under it and not over it (and under you)!  If you really wanted to go light on the tarp, and didn't think it would be windy, look at the 4 mil plastic that painters would use.  It's effectively thicker than a contractor trash bag, but not as thick as a tarp; that said, it rolls very, very light.  (Plastic tarps are normally 2.5x thicker.)  You could also take the rainfly from an inexpensive tent and use that.  Or lookup ""Kelty Noah's Tarp"", which is a tent-weight shelter for $60, and folds smaller than a plastic tarp.  (Although it's 5x the money, likely.)"
CampingandHiking,3dxfuh,Sneezer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:23 2015 UTC,"I assume you live in Australia?  I have a Kelty Noahs Tarp that I really like. There are probably better options but I got this at discount, and have been really impressed with it.  I also have some REI adjustable poles - Kelty also makes something similar.  I actually have that same GSI table. It is a pretty nice little piece of kit, although it takes some time to slide the two crossbars through the slats. It gets used for cooking, side table in the tent and next to my low height camp chair. Although most would consider it a luxury item, I find I get an awful lot of use out of having it.  I looked at the other tables, and I really like the Helinox one, but right now I don't think I will be getting it as this little GSI does fine.  Those canister stoves will burn for a while on a single can. I think Australia has more of the butane cans available compared to the smaller iso-butane canisters like Jetboil, etc. use. I could be wrong though. I have a mutifuel myself that runs off white gas, kerosene or regular unleaded. Works well, but it is heavier and more complicated to use. If all I am doing is boiling water I use my alcohol stove instead. IF I am going to do some actual cooking that involves simmering, etc. then I will bring one of the other stoves."
CampingandHiking,3dxfuh,chaiguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:00:47 2015 UTC,"yeah, i'm just worried that the GSI table will be too short, it shouldnt be as bad as cooking off of the floor though.  Cheers for linking the poles though, i've been looking for something exactly like that for quite some time."
CampingandHiking,3dxfuh,PriceZombie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:04:21 2015 UTC,"Don't buy a knock off stove. The MSR pocket rocket or the Jet Boil should last you a lifetime. If you can find the fuel canisters for these stoves, I would recommend them over the multi-fuel stoves as they are maintenance free and easier to use. I find that one canister will last me approximately 2 weeks of cooking lunch/dinner and coffee in the mornings.   I don't know that a table is 100% necessary. I've never found that I absolutely needed one. I simply set my stove on a rock or other hard surface (even just the ground). I'm always thinking of ways to get dual use out of objects. Will you need a cutting board? Perhaps a cutting board could also serve as a table for you? Of course, if you have the room, bring it! I like your section option the best, I've seen this tables and they look pretty good, I've just never needed one myself   Tarps- There are all kinds of options, from sin nylon to cuben fiber. You make it seem like price is a serious consideration so I'd look at sin nylon like these:  http://www.equinoxltd.com/the-gear/tarps-and-bivis-and-ground-cloths/egret_nylon_tarp.cfm   http://www.amazon.com/Kelty-4082021309-P-Noahs-Tarp-Shelter/dp/B00AA6SX8A/ref=pd_sim_468_5?ie=UTF8&refRID=18KJNNJT6R8XDJQ1MPZ0  http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Survival-Technologies-BASE-Tube/dp/B00JW64XGA/ref=pd_sim_468_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=18KJNNJT6R8XDJQ1MPZ0  People use telescopic hiking poles for tent poles all the time.

CampingandHiking,3dzvgq,Swerrdy,3,Mon Jul 20 21:43:16 2015 UTC,"The downside is that you DO risk running out of fuel if you go anywhere that:   1. doesn't have fuel, 2. doesn't allow you to use the fuel that IS there, 3. doesn't allow fires or 4. requires a fire pan under the fire.   All common scenarios where I camp; YMMV."

They're consistent, lightweight, can be used in any weather conditions."
CampingandHiking,3dzvgq,DeadAnthony,2,Mon Jul 20 23:15:54 2015 UTC,"Seems like everyone is in agreement to skip it. Glad I asked.  For the MSR WhisperLite, how long does each tank generally last?  I see they go for ~$20 from REI and the stove itself is $99. Being a poor student I'm not sure if I should spring for that stove or look around for cheaper alternatives.   What would you recommend?"
CampingandHiking,3dzvgq,Flatline42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:50:09 2015 UTC,"MSR's website shows this:  Burn time (white gas) per 600ml / 20 oz. of fuel    136 minutes Boil time (white gas), 1 liter  3.9 minutes Water boiled (white gas) per 100 ml of fuel 5.1 liters Water boiled (white gas) per 1 oz. of fuel  1.5 liters  It uses white gas, which is pretty cheap. 12 bucks for MSR brand white gas at amazon, 950ml or so. Which would allow you to cook for like... 3-4 hours?  That's cheaper than canister stoves. Though heavier probably than canister stoves. There's tradeoffs to everything.   I have a whisperlite on my ""one day"" list. In the mean time I use a trangia or supercat stove (cat food can with holes punched in it, google Super Cat stove) if I'm going denatured alcohol, and a pocket rocket if I'm using canister.  As for wood stoves, you have to assemble the thing, gather enough fuel to cook for 20 minutes or so, start the fire, tend the fire, feet twigs every minute or so into the fire, and keep it going until your water's boiling. That fuss on top of the fire restrictions I see frequently are a deal-killer for most bio-fuel solutions.  If you're hell-bent on a twig stove a biolite, while heavy, seems to be an okay solution. Not because of the USB charging, I actually wish they'd make a version that stripped that particulary circuitry out and saved weight, but because it apparently has a fan in it that acts as a billows for the stove and makes it burn hotter."

On a typical non winter trip, (3 days, 2 nights, 3 people), a 30oz bottle is more than enough. That's between 10 and 12 meals and a few cups of coffee.

Looks like it's on sale now. It lists reliable vs unreliable water sources and I can't recall it not being accurate.  The longest stretch is between Spooner Lake and Kingsbury Grade. We'd dropped a resupply at Tramway market and loaded up on bottled water when we passed through to pick it up. Spooner isn't the best - it was super low and ringed with waterfowl poop - but it's all you got over there.  One random tip: If you haven't decided yet, I recommend taking the Gray Lake route over the Mud Lake route. Gray Lake is really pretty and it's fed by an amazingly cold spring on the south side edge of the lake. Mud Lake was, well, low and muddy.

I can't recall specifically how much we used on that stretch, but I do know we had a couple dry camps over there and my pack was super water heavy on the way up to South Camp Peak from Spooner. One option, if you're in the area, is to leave yourself water caches, I suppose.  The whole trail is really well marked. The only time we had any difficulty was picking the trail back up after stopping at Tramway Market and the Fox and the Hound. Not sure if you'e planning on going through Kingsbury Grade on street or taking the trail around, but you'll be coming from the other direction, so it should be pretty easy. Just keep an eye out on the 207 and you'll see the trail."

CampingandHiking,3dwhkj,mountain_man56,4,Mon Jul 20 02:51:19 2015 UTC,"I hope you realize you are going to be above tree line for lots of this hike and that hammock is not going to be very helpful at many of the camping areas.  I would also highly recommend hiking poles, they can keep you from falling and make the steep climbs and descents a little easier on your knees.  Also, did I miss a rain jacket and pants?  I 100% guarantee you will get rained on during the day, probably hailed on too.  These also add a lot of extra warmth to your warm gear by blocking much more wind.  I would also recommend a winter hat and maybe gloves.  I also don't see a trowel and TP in that pile, rather important I think."
CampingandHiking,3dwhkj,The_High_Life,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:29:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not a hammock camper, but I believe the hammock will work just fine if you are spending 4 days out there.  Judging from u/mountain_man56 's dinners, that's what hes doing.  If going clockwise: 1st day hike past the 1st river crossing and camp somewhere below tree line before west maroon pass.  Lots of good trees to use.  2nd day hike over west maroon and frigid air pass and hike down into Fravert Basin, lots of good trees there pretty much all the way to the switchbacks leading up to Trailrider pass.  Even if you had a tent, you wouldn't want to camp in between the two passes in Hasley basin, as its pretty much all above treeline.    3rd day hike over Trail Rider and check out Snowmass Lake.  You could camp by there, but its probably crowded and loud, so move on a mile or two to some great forested areas to set up camp.  As for rain, I agree, get some rain gear!  I just did the loop, finished Sunday, 7/19.  We were totally fine without any rain gear the 1st two days, just had some light sprinkling.  The third day we had camp set up right before it started raining, and just relaxed in the tent from 1:00 PM to 3:30 PM, and then we were fine the rest of the day.    However, the fourth day, we started hiking at 3 AM and were over Buckskin pass by 6:00 AM.  By 7 AM, once we were below Tree Line, it started raining and did not stop until we had already driven past Glenwood Springs later that day after finishing the hike.    When we started the hike, weather reports showed 7/16 and 7/17 would rain, and 7/18 and 7/19 would not have any rain.  It was pretty much the opposite, so you can never really know out there."

CampingandHiking,3dwhkj,fieldsofkale69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:02:37 2015 UTC,"We only started at 3 AM the last day because we couldn't sleep!  Every other day we were awake by 5:30 and hiking by 7:00 AM.  It is important to get over the passes as early as possible to avoid storms, so the earlier you get started and the closer you camp to the next pass, the better.  There have been multiple injuries and deaths by lightning in Colorado in June and July, so be careful!  edit:  Bear canisters are required in Maroon Bells Wilderness now, and I don't think they consider ursacks good enough."

Once there I believe it is about 5km's to the upper Blue Lake. The trail itself is fairly mellow although there are a few slide patches where the trail gets over grown and hard to see.

CampingandHiking,3dvudk,Ajmac12,5,Sun Jul 19 23:24:21 2015 UTC,"When I get cramps (during a hike, that is), I know it is from having a lack of salt in my system due to sweating it out. Have you tried saltier drinks (gatorade) or snacks (salted peanuts / beef jerky) or something similar?   If you are getting them afterwards, you could just have very sore muscles. In that case, usually working the same muscles helps (stretch them out first) by hiking more."
CampingandHiking,3dvudk,eyesontheskydotcom,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:34:42 2015 UTC,"I typically do start drinking extra gatorade and eating beef jerky about a week before my trips and I still get leg cramps. I have never gotten them after. Thanks for the stretching advice, I should do more of that."
CampingandHiking,3dvudk,UC235,3,Mon Jul 20 00:04:01 2015 UTC,"If you're both eating salty foods and drinking gatorade, you may be dehydrating yourself anyway. Regular water is fine too, especially if you're eating lots of salt. Consider adding sources of potassium as well. Bananas, fresh berries, and so on.  When hiking, especially in summer, you should probably be drinking a few liters of water per day, as you need to replace a lot of water lost as sweat. When I thru-hiked the AT in 2012, I was pushing 2 gallons a day in July in NJ. I always found crystal light or similar non-caloric drink mixes made it much easier to drink large volumes of liquid, and putting a 2 or 3L water bladder in your pack makes it convenient to drink as you go which leads to higher intake overall. Your urine should be almost or completely colorless."
CampingandHiking,3dvudk,eyesontheskydotcom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:11:15 2015 UTC,"If you're both eating salty foods and drinking gatorade, you may be dehydrating yourself anyway.   I think you misunderstood what I said. When I get cramps, I know I have a lack of sodium in my system. I know this because quite literally, every time this happens and I ingest fluids (or even solids) with sodium, the cramps go away. That's not dehydrating me; that's raising my electrolytes back to a proper level. Having experienced this on more than a few occasions, I have a good idea of what my body is telling me in those circumstances. I simply pay attention, and do what is necessary to put things back in balance.   Also, while I agree with you that one does need to drink plenty of fluid when hiking (along with getting sufficient sodium - you sweat it out with the water) your urine need not be colorless to have the proper amount of fluid intake. That's a myth. In fact, you may be drinking too much water if it's consistently clear."
CampingandHiking,3dvudk,curiousincident,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:57:44 2015 UTC,That is incredibly too much salt. The body is really good at regulating salt content at normal levels. You don't need to oversalt yourself. If anything you are going to make yourself hypertensive prior and that in itself is not any good.
CampingandHiking,3dvudk,sjansen1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:24 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was a lack of stretching before hand and after, I always kept hydrated but never used energy drinks. My cramps we're hell after"
CampingandHiking,3dvudk,eyesontheskydotcom,2,Mon Jul 20 02:36:58 2015 UTC,"You body loses sodium when you sweat. If you don't have enough sodium in your diet, and are only drinking water, you may be sodium-deficient in those higher exercise circumstances while you sweat. (If you think about it, did our ancestors from thousands of years ago stretch out? Or did they just eat a healthy diet and work?)  The way I figured this out was drinking a Gatorade (about 16 oz) when I cramped up. The cramps went away in about 15-30 minutes afterwards. That's when I knew it was a lack of sodium / electrolytes. Even without Gatorade around, you can simply eat a snack that has sodium - salted peanuts with the water, for example.   Everyone is different though, so adjust to see what works for you. Can't hurt to try it once, right?"
CampingandHiking,3dvudk,sjansen1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:07:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the information. I really appreciate it.  Sounds like I'll be stocking up on some energy drinks next time around. I never drank energy drinks after any kind of exercise/sport I just stretched any cramps I got or wait till the pain subsided. I always remained hydrated with water though. I do bring salted peanuts whenever I head out.
CampingandHiking,3dvudk,eyesontheskydotcom,2,Mon Jul 20 06:50:20 2015 UTC,"stocking up on some energy drinks   Just make sure they're the kind for exercise (Gatorade / Powerade), not ones like ""Monster"" or ""Red Bull."" That stuff is mostly caffeine and sugar. ;-)  I'm not saying that will for for you. But it may be what your body is experiencing, and it can't hurt to try it and see if it helps. So don't stock up just yet - get a bottle or two, and try one when it happens, and see how that helps your cramps (or not)."
CampingandHiking,3dvudk,postrnut,2,Mon Jul 20 12:21:05 2015 UTC,"I used to experience pretty bad leg cramping. As others have suggested, first check is rehydrating. Not only should you stay on top of your hydration during the hike, but should top off when you stop for the evening. Rehydration salts, such as Nuun, have been a key part of our rehydration at the end of the day. Highly recommend, particularly on hot, sweaty days.  The second thing I do to avoid cramps is to do an effective stretch at the end of the day. I'll do a number of stretches to make sure my legs and core are properly flexed out. Always feel like a million dollars when I am done.   If my wife makes me/convinces me to do some brief yoga in the morning, I usually don't regret it and feel better throughout the day."
CampingandHiking,3dvudk,pjm73,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:02:28 2015 UTC,I have the same problem. I eat bananas and drink Gatorade well in advance.  My trail snacks include a lot of salty food. I stretch at the onset of leg cramps and when I finish the hike.   I prepare for hikes by running and the stair master. Don't need to train harder?    I also sweat a lot. Do I just need to hydrate more?  Any tips I would greatly appreciate. Thanks.
CampingandHiking,3dvudk,eyesontheskydotcom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:45:22 2015 UTC,"For me, I find that when my muscles cramp like that, I don't have enough sodium in me. One way to find out is to try drinking some Gatorade when that happens (I will often drink about 16 oz or so at that time). The cramps go away in 15-30 minutes for me when this occurs.   Hydrating more with just water may actually reduce your sodium levels further. Granted, too much salt/sodium isn't helpful either, but if you sweat a lot, you're losing sodium in addition to water."

Twice they've popped over to see what was going on, most likely because they saw or heard us (in the countryside voices and such can carry). One just came over to say hello and we asked him in person if it was alright to camp where we were, he agreed. The other just asked us to move as he was going to move his sheep in the morning iirc.   General rules: don't litter, don't be loud late, don't be rude and just generally don't be a nuisance. We stuck to forests as we had hammocks and I think that helped to hide us. Pretty vague but hope it helps. (I was in Wales camping along the Offas dyke.)"

We have wild camping info in our wiki, including a link to the Dartmoor NPA map showing where you can legally wild camp. Dartmoor is the only national park in England and Wales where it's legal to wild camp. There are places in Scotland too.  However, from a practical point of view you can pretty much stealth camp in most national parks if you pay attention to how concealed your location is, don't make lots of noise or leave a mess, and most importantly you stick to the stealth camping motto - pitch late, leave early.

Anyway, to sum things up, I've camped before, but I've always wanted to go backpacking. I was never really able to due to money and lack of gear. However, I live a few miles from the trailhead to the summit of this mountain, so I went and did an overnight trip there. I wish I had been able to use better year, or at least have most of the necessary year in the first place, but it was still very fun and I hope I can do this more often on the future! Had some great views from up there too!  Also, if anyone would like to know, the hike is roughly 14-17 miles depending on where you park and what route you take, and it involved about 4,000-5,000 feet of elevation gain, with the summit being 6,367 feet."

Sisar Road is by The Summit burger place just next to the general store nearby. There are several blog posts about taking Sisar Canyon to Topa Topa Bluff that show you where to go as well.  You can also reach Hines Peak, Chief Peak, and much more from there as well. One guy did a triple crown of those two peaks as well as Topa Topa in one day, starting at Sisar and ending down by Thacher School. You could also hike back down through the punch bowls if you wanted. Lots of options."

CampingandHiking,3dtqiu,dangerousdave2244,2,Sun Jul 19 14:05:04 2015 UTC,"This site is great. I love how I can get forecasts at elevation. Most of the standard weather sites just give forecasts for towns. snow-forecast.com is pretty cool too.  Also, I agree with u/meyrpw about weather.gov. I think the commercial weather sites tend to forecast extremes to boost ratings rather than give most probable conditions. If it's a heatwave, forecasted temps always seem a bit higher than actually occur. In the winter, lows seldom get as low as the forecast and snowfall is less. weather.gov feeds you unbiased predictions as they have no motive to boost ratings."
CampingandHiking,3dtqiu,scfoothills,3,Sun Jul 19 21:50:22 2015 UTC,"weather.gov  that's the NOAA site that generates all the data, and most of the predictions.  I'll admit they bury some of the predictions in hard to find locations, but it's all there."
CampingandHiking,3dtqiu,meyerpw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:18:37 2015 UTC,Most other websites or weather predictions are pulled from weather.gov and the NOAA as well.
CampingandHiking,3dtqiu,BigBlueTrekker,2,Sun Jul 19 14:55:49 2015 UTC,"One of the best features of weather.gov is the ability to do point forecasts. So, when you pull up the town closest to the trailhead, you can use the little google map to pick the exact campsites you'll be staying at in the backcountry. This lets you get the best possible forecast for your specific location that accounts for things such as elevation.  No expert, but I am guessing this is where mountain-forecasts pulls their data from.  Thanks NPS for teaching me about the point forecast!"

CampingandHiking,3dtuhs,kaiser__soze,4,Sun Jul 19 12:10:52 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of this brand, but from some of the specs I would expect it is a low cost ""department store"" style tent. Some reasons I think this:   The poles are fiberglass. Quality tents will use DAC aluminum poles for their lighter weight and durability. Lower waterproofness rating. The Berg tent's waterproofness is rated at 2000mm, the minimum threshold for what is considered waterproof (1500mm).  I've never heard of them before. Good news travels fast in the gear world, not being able to find any reviews is a red flag.   I would look elsewhere, but thats just me."

CampingandHiking,3dv8xp,adeadhead,6,Sun Jul 19 20:22:00 2015 UTC,Don't buy the LifeStraw.     If you want a filter that's actually intended for serious use while backpacking - buy a Sawyer Squeeze or Sawyer Mini. $20 everyday.
CampingandHiking,3dv8xp,cwcoleman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:01:45 2015 UTC,Serious question: can I ask why this one is preferred? I'm new to this.
CampingandHiking,3dv8xp,bits_of_wood,2,Mon Jul 20 00:37:34 2015 UTC,"The Sawyer Squeeze / Mini is more versatile. The LifeStraw is designed for 'straw' mode only. That means to consume clean water your mouth has to be directly on the filter.      The Sawyer filter is designed to connect to a 'dirty bag'. With the idea that you scoop dirty water into this provided bladder, attach the filter, squeeze - and out comes clean water. You can drink this clean water directly out of the Sawyer, just like the LifeStraw. Or... you can store it into a clean container or a cooking vessel. That advantage of being able to clean, store, and drink later is a huge advantage when backpacking. Taking out your filter every time you want a sip of water is not practical.            The Sawyer filter is also designed to be cleaned. They get clogged with all the junk they filter out, and back flushing water through the filter keeps it going longer/faster. That gives the Sawyer filter near endless life - quoted at 1 million gallons (vs. 264 of the LifeStraw).      Sawyer has better performance too (.1 microns vs .2 microns) (99.9999% vs 99.9% for protozoa). Neither stop viruses."

CampingandHiking,3ds1g4,shorthairedlonghair,2,Sun Jul 19 05:47:36 2015 UTC,"Here is what I carry, I have a minimalist FAK.  Benadryl - In case of some allergic reaction from something ingested, a plant, a sting or bite, etc. I always carry a couple of these just to combat.  Ranitidine - This is an acid reducer, I have a prescription and take two a day, you can easily get this stuff though and it's good to have especially if you're eating a lot of high sodium/acidic foods. Sometimes even too much water can cause reflux or heartburn. I bring two for every day.  TUMS - A nice backup which is fast acting for that heartburn. As you can tell, this is an issue for me so I always have my bases covered. I bring a few of these just in case.  Ibuprofen - Good for those knees, other joints, headaches, fever, etc. I always carry about four for each day just in case.  Claritin - Or some other form of antihistamine during those bad allergy seasons. I get the 24 hour ones and carry one for each day if I have allergies.  Icyhot - I found these in single serving packs about the size of a ketchup pack, I bring a few in case  have a bad ache or pain.  Bandaids - I bring a few of the regular sized ones, and a couple large ones. Self-explanatory.  Gauze - I bring one of these, they come in the single use packs. Self-explanatory.  Anti-biotic cream - You can get a small tube, or I have a few single use packs that I squeezed into cut pieces of straw then sealed the ends with a lighter. Self-explanatory.  I'm not a doctor, nurse, medic, etc. These are things that everyone can buy and use, I won't be stitching myself up. If you have things like bandanas, cordage, duct-tape, etc. all of these can be conjoined with other things like sticks or whatever with some ingenuity to help you get to civilization. The point of first aid is to allow you to be able to get to real help. I know some people will throw needle and thread in their kits; but they have no idea how to give stitches and also don't realize how painful that will be without anesthetic.  I bring enough to treat whatever small things may bother me, keep cuts clean, and if anything worse happened then I am not qualified to treat myself and my only priority is getting to help. Whether you're an experienced backpacker or not, if you're not a medical professional or have medical/FA training then you're not responsible for treating everything that happens. Usually experience would just mean ""Oh you have heart burn? Here are some tums, yeah that can happen, I didn't think of that on one of my first trips and it ruined my night."" not ""Oh you broke your arm and the bone is protruding the skin, move over I got this, I once did a 250 mile trip."""

CampingandHiking,3drncd,VolfgangAmadeus,2,Sat Jul 18 20:11:42 2015 UTC,"I did a 19 day trip from LA to Glacier back in 2002!  Some recollections:  Great Basin NP: the cave tour of Lehman (sp?) Cavern is worth it if you dig caves at all.  This place is prime for stargazing, so if you do sky photos/telescope stuff, bring that gear.  I've never done the hike to Wheeler Peak and the bristlecones, but I hear great things.  Glacier NP: I wish I had better weather and more time there.  A local pointed us to Polebridge, MT just outside the park on the Flathead river.  You should go.  The Northern Lights Saloon was a great spot to meet travelers and locals and get dinner.  The Mercantile is unique and cool and the area is spectacular.  You can even stay at a hostel out there I think.  In addition, I believe the Flathead is known for excellent fly fishing.  Yellowstone NP: full of traffic.  I would spend more time in Glacier and Teton rather than Yellowstone, but it is worth seeing the geysers and the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone.  Grand Teton NP: Way less crowded than Yellowstone and beautiful.  I stayed at Jenny Lake; it's a nice campground and the easy dayhike around the lake and up to the falls on the far side is great (we saw Moose!).  Zion NP: Through-hike the Virgin River Canyon if you can.  You have to get a permit the day before (which is contingent on weather b/c the canyon gets flash floods) and you have to hear a safety briefing when you get it.  You also have to reserve a spot on the shuttle which runs from the NP lodge up to Chamberlain's Ranch (where the canyon drops down from the mesa).  You'll be wading, swimming, and scrambling for like 19 miles down the canyon and it dumps you right back at the NP Lodge more or less.  Best hike ever.  Wear boots and just know that they'll get wet.  The people I saw in sandals and watershed things were all crawling along with stone bruises on their feet. Oh yeah... and a trekking pole or good walking stick is a necessity.  Do it.  The branch into Orderville Canyon (just a few miles from the bottom) is worth a least a little time: go up and check out how deep and narrow that is.  Super scenery unlike any other place.  That's all I got.  Have fun!"
CampingandHiking,3drncd,cbg,2,Sat Jul 18 21:18:17 2015 UTC,Thanks for your thorough take on the route! Will definitely look into your recommendation in Montana and Grand Teton.
CampingandHiking,3drncd,USMCFieldMP,2,Sun Jul 19 05:38:23 2015 UTC,"I've been to Yellowstone, Teton, and Zion; agree with what he has said. Yellowstone is very large and there is a lot to see. Old Faithful, Grand Canyon of Yellowstone (Upper & Lower Falls), and the Grand Prismatic Spring are my recommended ""Must See"" sites. Grand Prismatic Spring is best seen from the Fairy Falls trail as it's a bit elevated. A don't mess with the buffalo, they're very dangerous. I almost saw 3 people gored while I was there because they think they're harmless cows that they can pose for pictures next to.  As far as Zion goes, I believe the hike he is talking about is called ""The Narrows"". I wanted to do that one, but we didn't have the time. We did Angel's Landing which was quite spectacular, but it is very strenuous and not for those that are absolutely terrified of heights.  I looked at where you're going and made you a map with all the scenic roads that I took/know of in the areas. I did the destinations in reverse order of what you listed them though, and added in some filler. UT-12 is amazing. I-70 through western Colorado is amazing. Beartooth out of Yellowstone is awesome. As is US-12 in Idaho."
CampingandHiking,3drncd,cbg,2,Sun Jul 19 08:59:34 2015 UTC,"Right, the Virgin River is the one that comes down into the park and ""the narrows"" is a segment of the Virgin River (Zion) Canyon. However, you're not supposed to hike more than a short distance up from the NP area into the canyon without a permit. It's not for legalistic fun, either; its bc of the flash flood danger I mentioned. They want to know who's up the canyon in case of flood.  Through hiking from the top lets you see a lot more of the canyon than the hike up from the bottom and it's easier to walk downstream than up.   Again, I highly recommend this hike."
CampingandHiking,3drncd,badosduena,2,Sun Jul 19 17:45:27 2015 UTC,"When in Glacier, try to get a campsite at Many Glacier. There are a lot of long day hikes that are a blast!  If you want to do back country, I would either recommend in the Many Glacier or Belly River areas. Both are on the West side of the park and are a lot of fun.    Good luck!"
CampingandHiking,3drncd,211logos,2,Sat Jul 18 22:43:25 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip!
CampingandHiking,3drncd,ADK80000,2,Sun Jul 19 05:38:38 2015 UTC,"Avoid the freeways unless you wanna bore yourselves to death getting to a nice spot. Longer on a two-lane feels shorter than the reverse.  Given your existing choices, I'd suggest 395 to 6 to GBNP. 395 up through Owens Valley is really nice. There's boonie camping out on 6 as you go over ranges; it's hot though. 395 to 168 to 266 to 95 to  6 is even more adventurous.  Going north from there is maybe the hottest, emptiest part of the trip. Until you get up on the north side of the Snake River Plain (the mountains of ID) it can blaze. Dunno where you're going in ID; maybe just blast through, since you have more high ground on your return south from Glacier.  From Jackson Hole I'd recommend 191 south: you hit all kinds of good stuff: Flaming Gorge, Dinosaur NM, Capitol Reef (one of my fave campgrounds). Then down 12, one of the best roads in the US bar none. Bryce, Kodachrome, then down to Zion. These areas in UT are more unique than the mountain parks, but they can also be appreciated even just as a road trip with stops for the night; sorta infinitely scalable, if you will. Either a fly-by or a month is good since the scenery is so spectacular."
CampingandHiking,3drncd,themoreweexplore,2,Sat Jul 18 22:56:17 2015 UTC,Thanks. Will look into all of this on the map!
CampingandHiking,3drncd,dead-serious,2,Sun Jul 19 05:39:24 2015 UTC,Yes! I still remember my trip down 191 8ish years ago as my favorite stretch of road I've ever driven.
CampingandHiking,3drncd,Huckleberry-Hiker,2,Sun Jul 19 15:15:15 2015 UTC,"The sawtooths will be amazing.  Yellowstone did absolutely nothing for me, I don't plan on going back. Way too much traffic and too many RVs everywhere. Plus I wasn't a huge fan of there being restaurants and hotels and service stations in the middle of a NP. It felt more like disneyland than nature.  Grand Teton is amazing; way better than Yellowstone in my opinion. There's some incredible backcountry at Grand Teton.  Great basin is a really cool, underrated NP. No bears or mountain lions. I recommend the baker lake loop over to johnson lake backpacking loop. Here's a video of when we did it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbBTc2W2f4A  Zion has too much good stuff to see in only a day or two. It almost requires its own week or two to really explore it. I hated Zion the first 3 times I went, because I only had a day or two and did day hikes. The best stuff in Zion is far away from the tourists.  Zion is extremely busy (but not as busy as yellowstone) and you'll need permits for the good stuff."

A simple disposable (gatorade) bottle works as a fine cheap solution Depending on what types of fuel you have access to - stoves can be complex or basic. You can't fly with fuel canisters typically - so need to check and see what is available upon arrival   What about these other items?       Map and compass - even if the trail is super easy to follow, these help Headlamp - cheap ones work fine, better than a handheld torch Water filter - how do you plan to get drinkable water along the route? Trash bag - to carry out your waste Poles - they help on mountainous trips, especially with the knees   Clothes really depend on expected conditions. Do you forecast rain/wind? A rain jacket is common safety piece.  Whats the high/low temp? I personally like shorts for anything above freezing conditions. Pants are nice for in camp though. Will bugs be a problem (here in the US the mosquitoes and flies are killing me)? Bandanas and hats are always on my packing list.         You didn't mention shoes. You'll need something that can handle the trip. Heavy boots aren't always required, but on rocky or wet trails they really help. I like trail runners myself. Gaiters help keep junk out too.

With fire permit.  But it can change there, and in any other management area in CA, on a daily basis. I would not plan on the exclusive use of fires for say cooking anywhere in CA in the summer.  And where fires are safer there's less wood and you may not be able to gather it for a fire, so bring your own charcoal. And other areas might require a fire pan.

CampingandHiking,3drn0s,jetflier7727,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:09:02 2015 UTC,"$250 for 1 person for the backpack, sleeping bag, and sleeping pad? As in $500 for 2 backpacks, 2 sleeping bags, and 2 sleeping pads?      In general - I normally recommend:       Enlightened Equipment quilts for 3-season (above freezing) kits Therm-a-rest is my favorite sleeping pad brand. The NeoAir is what I sleep on year-round. The zlite is low cost + high durable, yet less comfortable. Gregory and Osprey make wonderful beginner packs. Variety of sizes and styles to suite all kinds of adventures. You really need to try on a pack to know if it fits your body.   Unfortunately - all of these items would put you over budget. I'm not going to be much help with a $500 total for 2 people. Maybe you could find quality used items? Or rent/borrow until you save more?      I've never tried that Teton brand, it is very much a low-quality / budget option. I'd be VERY concerned with that 20F bag. The rating is not official - it is basically a made up marketing number. There is no way you would be able to fall asleep in that bag in 20F temps (way too little filling for that), maybe 40F but you just don't know because it's not a EN rating. A 65L bag is quite large. Common for beginners - but I would seriously recommend getting something smaller. With a big bag - you'll be more encouraged to fill it - which equals a heavy pack. (although if you have budget items they'll be more bulky/heavy so you need the bigger bag... so.. depending on the rest of your kit you may need this size) The adjustable torso is a nice feature. Just on the heavy side and l don't personally like the small side pockets."
CampingandHiking,3drn0s,cwcoleman,0,Sat Jul 18 20:31:26 2015 UTC,"With that budget you can either get a bunch of mediocre stuff or some nicer stuff and the rest fairly cheap.  I would prioritize your backpack over the other options by a mile. A bad sleeping bag just weighs more and takes up more space than a good sleeping bag. A bad pad is maybe a little less comfortable or less warm than a good pad. A bad backpack will be less comfortable and painful all day long.  So your first priority is a good backpack. I would aim for something in the 60L range, so you can use it for a variety of trip lengths. If you want to get multiple specialized packs later, then you can look for other options then. Buy this in a store where you can try packs on and so forth, there are lots of guides on how to select a pack. Be willing to spend lots of your budget here. Or maybe you get lucky and find a cheap backpack that feels perfect for you.  Second, get a pad. You want something you won't hate at night, and it should be cheap since you likely won't have much money left over. Zrests and big Agnes pads are decent cheap options.  Third, spend the rest of your money on what will likely be a fairly bad sleeping bag. But it'll just cost more and be bulky.  I would recommend used gear sites like geartrade.com for the sleeping pad and bag."
CampingandHiking,3drn0s,Acies,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:01:36 2015 UTC,"Check out Kelty backpacks.

I would never trust the 20* number, but I've used the pack on nights where temps were in the 40's without much discomfort. When in doubt, just pack a pair of long underwear and a long sleeve shirt.  For packs, you might consider the REI Flash 62L and the women's 58L for your girlfriend. We picked those up during the REI 4th of July sale for 99 bucks each and just took them out for a 2 night backpacking trip in Big Bend and they were perfect. Comfortable to wear and plenty of space (they can fit a bear canister if needed).

Many reviews of the Jetboil indicate the flame control of the stove is such that it's pretty much either ""on"" or ""off"" with little control in-between. That's why I was hoping to use my stove; it has a semi-usable flame control for cooking more than just ""boil water fast.""  I do appreciate the suggestion though; thank you.

But probably something thick like Mac & Cheese would be a disaster (unless you did boil in the bag style).  I've never tried to eat noodles with a spoon :-) I guess you could cut them up.

But because of the snow rapport I got when I called abisko tourist-station we rebooked our trip. Instead we walked in Jämtlandsfjällen in the area of storulvån. Still quite a bit of snow but not nearly as much as in your pictures. May I ask about the snow bridges over the streams (those where you can't see/almost can't see the stream below) were they stable, or did you  step trough the snow at places?"

It has a gorgeous waterfall(that unfortunately you can't get close to) that's not too far of a walk. Or if you want something a bit tougher, there's a 20 mile backpacking trail that leads to natural hot springs. What about beaches? Wanna have a bonfire at night? Huntington and dockweiler beach are the first to come to mind. If you're looking for a beach during the day, I personally love Zuma! The water is nice and a little south from there is a bit of a cove that I can't remember the name but people rock climb by there and the view is just something else. It all depends on what you're really trying to do."

It's hard to think of a mountaineering objective anywhere in the west that doesn't include a t-storm risk.  But since we've been getting all this stuff from the south lately, why not up to the Lassen area? it's pretty good for last minute trips, like the Trinity Alps. Not visited as much as other areas.

They are larger mummy style bags and are a bit weird since they have no insulation on the bottom of the bag, but have a sleeve that the pad slides into.

I have some roll-up pants from REI that I like because they have lots of pockets and where I hike it's nice to have the pants option. I see lots of women hiking in normal fitness clothes too (leggings, shorts, etc) so you could also go that route. For tops I mostly do cheap workout tees (Target of course) but also have a long sleeve button up for when I want to be out of the sun (Columbia Tamiami). I know clothes shopping can be the worst, good luck!"
CampingandHiking,3dnmi9,fryburglar,2,Fri Jul 17 20:06:10 2015 UTC,"REI has decent plus size options. You don't need a full wardrobe of 100% hiking specific gear though, workout gear will work fine as long it's not cotton. Bike or running shorts are good.   You might be able to grab some basics such as shirts and running shorts from men's as fit is less of an issue for basic tees & stretchy shorts compared to pants."

CampingandHiking,3dj00v,fryburglar,3,Thu Jul 16 19:16:57 2015 UTC,"It was a three day trip. Here is the area we were in. We departed from Fern Lake Trailhead, and followed the trail up to Fern Lake, where this is a large group campsite. We then hiked up to Odessa Lake and traced around the lake's to the south. We continued off trail to the south following the river past Grace falls all the way up to the last little glacial lake before Ptarmigan Pass, which included a harrowing ascent up a steep snow covered slope. We were up just over 11,000 feet in a cathedral-like alpine cirque.   With some worrying looking weather blowing in, we took a short break and then cut down over towards lake Helene. At this point, the group split up, with half taking the trail back to camp, and the other cutting off trail again through the woods towards Round Pond. Contouring around Joe Mills Mountain we found ourself on a natural elk trail that led us roughly in the right direction. Finding the small pond with just map and compass felt like a huge victory, and from there our group decided to bomb directly down over the hill to Fern Lake, another sickeningly steep snow covered hill. Fortunately everyone made it down safely with a great story to tell!  The last day the group was spent and we took our time and checked out Spruce Lake and Loomis Lake before heading back to the trailhead. Never seen so many trout in my life as I saw in the river that feeds out of those lakes.   Mind blowing trip. By far the coolest thing I've ever done."

Which apparently had bald tires and ended up flipping one night. After that car was destroyed and other family drama he went back to hiking (and a hitch in a plane!). Then multiple summits of Whitney, with weird stuff in-between. A tooth problem was in there somewhere too. Police incident was the last update a few weeks ago.

You can also buy permethrin concentrate in bulk, dilute it and soak clothes. You have to reapply every season or so. Another option is to have Insect Shield treat it for $10 a piece or so and it will last for years."
CampingandHiking,3djdek,mvmntsofthemind,2,Thu Jul 16 20:43:32 2015 UTC,"Yup, great for ticks. It's supposed to kill ticks rather than just repel them, preventing them from crawling up your clothes until they find exposed skin. It's supposed to last 42 days, so it would be wise to spray it a few days before you plan on going in the woods."
CampingandHiking,3djdek,keepmoving2,2,Sat Jul 18 00:18:19 2015 UTC,Oh it does. I wore a high top crew sock last year down here in Florida and I was covered in ticks. You can watch them crawl up your sock and die. If you have a low cut sock they may make it on to you. I also spray my shoes.

As for storing it mine (D7100) just gets wrapped up in clothes in one of my dry bags, nothing super special but DSLR's are fairly tough and will handle that no problems."
CampingandHiking,3di3bs,makinbacon42,3,Thu Jul 16 14:07:25 2015 UTC,This. Rig your tripod to your ice ax loops and shove your release and filters in your pockets and you'll be ready to go.
CampingandHiking,3di3bs,pacobriente,7,Thu Jul 16 16:55:45 2015 UTC,Or if your water bottle pockets are big enough I chuck my tripod in there and use one of the side compression straps to keep it in place.

CampingandHiking,3di3bs,garrettnb,2,Thu Jul 16 20:00:49 2015 UTC,It's amazing. The plate pops on/off in a minute and the camera locks on really securely. I love mine.

CampingandHiking,3di3bs,ronny_reagan,9,Thu Jul 16 15:21:29 2015 UTC,My biggest problem was keeping the camera accessible while hiking. To solve this I got a Peak Designs Camera Clip and now keep the camera on my belt or shoulder strap. It's expensive for what it is but feels solid and so far I'm really liking it. If it's raining then I just put plastic bag over it. I have a nice hard sided Pelican case but that only gets used for the car - too heavy to lug around.
CampingandHiking,3di3bs,meyerpw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:45:10 2015 UTC,"FYI, peak is coming (maybe they're already done so) out with a product called shell, to help protect your camera during light rain."
CampingandHiking,3di3bs,hi_in_fiber,9,Thu Jul 16 14:30:27 2015 UTC,"Storing your camera equipment while backpacking/camping is a bit counterintuitive because it makes it harder to access, which means you end up shooting significantly less that you would otherwise. All the while, you're lugging extra weight.  I carry my Canon 7D and 17-40mm like this all day long and then just toss it in the tent at night: https://i.imgur.com/VvF9Q.jpg  It works on a huge Kelty pack and a lighter REI Flash; pretty comfortable too if there's no tripod plate attached to the camera. The only requirement is that the sternum strap is long enough to get around the lens. Downside: it gets dusty and sweaty, but that's the cost of easy accessibility."
CampingandHiking,3di3bs,pretzacoatl,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:00:00 2015 UTC,Nice! I will definitely need to try this
CampingandHiking,3di3bs,awsxdrfvgyhnjik,3,Thu Jul 16 18:31:31 2015 UTC,"I'm using a padded lunch box to hold my DSLR in my pack and whenever I need the camera to be accessible, I made up an adjustable paracord strap that would connect my DSLR to my shoulder straps and keep the camera at my sternum. I'll have to find a pic to share of my lunchbox setup and the strap system but that is the absolutely cheapest way to go about it for me. Figured that you might see that as a cheap enough option to at least try for a bit while you consider the more expensive options that others mentioned here.  ::EDIT:: http://imgur.com/a/jDZBw  I am able to carry three lens this way and my extra batteries fit in the small zipped compartment in front of the bag. You can see how the camera is attached to my shoulder straps (sorry about the upside down pic, not sure what happened there with imgur upload). The DSLR in the lunch box do not have the battery grip installed. I removed it for hiking to save on weight and bulk. The pic of it on the strap was before I had to cut the paracord side strap off (since I didn't make it detachable in the first place by mistake).  You can use the knot [Final Edit: Looking at the knots again, I'm not sure if I'm using this one.] as shown in this page, http://www.animatedknots.com/blakes/index.php?Categ=typehitches&LogoImage=LogoGrog.jpg&Website=www.animatedknots.com , to be able to adjust the length of the strap however long you would like it to be.  In the link, imagine that the blue cord heading off screen to the lower left loops around to become the red cord heading down through the screen. Normally this will weaken the knot, but using carabiners, the weight of the DSLR will keep it tight enough. Just don't forget to tie a stopper knot in the loose end! you wouldn't want the camera to slip right off your strap like that. I am able to tighten the strap all the way up to my collarbone or loosen it all the way down to the waistline. Very versatile this way.  I had the lunch box for a long time so I have no idea how much it cost, should be very cheap though. Might be a good idea to get a fresh one with no or minimal food smell in it. I cleaned my thoroughly as much as possible so that the DSLR won't pick up any food scents. Pack a small garbage bag or a large ziplock in the front compartment of the lunch box so you can put the whole thing away from the rain if needed.  ::EDIT2:: Since you have a Canon DSLR, maybe you can consider trying out Magic Lantern as seen in this link, http://www.magiclantern.fm/ . You can use the free program to leave behind the cable release at least and use the viewfinder proximity sensor to trigger your camera instead? There are many other features that you may like to check out and it will add a lot of functions to your DSLR. Generally Magic Lantern is more for videos but there are many things that helps with complex photography like time lapse and whatnot. The more function you can add to the camera via magic lantern, the less equipment you will need for specific photography that you may want to do."
CampingandHiking,3di3bs,CoGa,2,Thu Jul 16 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"Can't really help at this time but when you are ready to spend a little money, the f stop bags are my go to camping/camera bags.   The larger ones can easily hold all the camping equipment you need plus a DSLR and a few lenses.

CampingandHiking,3di3bs,SnapHook,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:42:50 2015 UTC,"Same boat, look into something called Inserts if you like. They are padded compartments to hold camera stuff that goes inside a bag.   I researched these, but ultimately decided against them. If you keep your camera stored inside your bag you'll never take it out.   I keep my camera by my side now with a strap. Extra lens have their own pouch and I bought a small bathroom travel bag to hold the small accessories.  I used Bungie cord to build a small tripod holder on the side of my bag."
CampingandHiking,3di3bs,DF7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:41:49 2015 UTC,"As many other people have said, I think the key is attaching it to your shoulder or hip straps in some manner or another. One cheap option is tying the camera strap to the top of your pack and then running it over your shoulder. Then use your chest strap to secure it somehow so it doesn't bounce around too much.   I just got the Capture Clip, but haven't used it in the field yet, so I can't recommend it. I'm about to take it on the Colorado Trail though, we'll see how that goes."

CampingandHiking,3di3bs,hevnshandgrenade,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:09:20 2015 UTC,"The trick is to keep it both accessible and secure. There can't be too much swinging around and bouncing. It needs to be easily covered from weather, and you need to be able to grab it quickly and easily.   For hiking I use the Capture Pro clip as a few other have mentioned below. This can be slightly painful on the chest/collarbone using heavier bodies and lenses though, but you can buy a Pro pad that alleviates the discomfort. To keep out rain I use a small dry bag that slips up over the lens and then over the body. I kind of spin and fold the top and then wrap it around the capture clip and clip the ends together in the traditional dry bag style.    I used to rig a sling across my chest using an S-biner and my chest and shoulder straps. This was a little less secure, but much cheaper.  For random, temporary storage I like to use the small cheap neoprene sleeves with draw strings. These give a little padding for my extra lenses and allow me to stuff them pretty much anywhere in my bag and provide a little peace of mind. For longer storage, I have considered getting a large pelican box for everything."

The strap was held up by the backpack straps. Perfectly accessible right in front of me, and comfortable!"
CampingandHiking,3di3bs,makinbacon42,-2,Fri Jul 17 00:14:32 2015 UTC,"11-16mm is awfully wide for a general hiking lens on an APS-C camera.   I'm not in the Canon ecosystem but I'd look closely at something like the pancake 40mm prime for general use while hiking.  Tiny, lightweight, and a very useful focal length."
CampingandHiking,3di3bs,Ubizubi,4,Thu Jul 16 14:08:55 2015 UTC,"Not if you're doing landscapes, that and a 50mm (or 85 if you want longer) make a great combination on APS-C"
CampingandHiking,3di3bs,pucklermuskau,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:11:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'd want a lens that wide strapped to my chest for use at a moment's notice. It seems more suited to an occasional shot at a particularly scenic vista.  I understand not everyone wants to shoot wildlife, but a marmot, moose, or anything smaller than a rhinoceros would look microscopic with 11-16 unless you're on top of it. :)  I was trying to suggest an inexpensive lens that may be slightly more useful as a walkabout lens."
CampingandHiking,3di3bs,couchpoop,3,Thu Jul 16 14:19:52 2015 UTC,you're much more likely to see a nice landscape than a marmot though.
CampingandHiking,3di3bs,211logos,2,Thu Jul 16 16:16:22 2015 UTC,"Usually, but that depends where you are.  More importantly, I can pretty much guarantee the landscape will still be there after you switch lenses. The marmot, not so much."
CampingandHiking,3di3bs,couchpoop,2,Thu Jul 16 19:01:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe the marmot, but certainly not the bear....  OTOH, who hasn't had the sun go behind a cloud just as you wanna catch those last rays....  For me, I find it's easy to make a panorama from a longer lens in Photoshop than to zoom in and crop a marmot in a shot from a wide lens. YMMV."

CampingandHiking,3dknqq,SoldierOnce,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:46:18 2015 UTC,It can be buffed out though if you really want to. A dremel and a polishing wheel will do it. But it will just happen again because it's carbon steel.
CampingandHiking,3dknqq,psilokan,5,Fri Jul 17 02:27:59 2015 UTC,"Your blade seems to have high carbon content, any acid that is left on the blade will react to the carbon and leave a dark patina. Some will call it ""acid patina"". After cutting fruits (citrus, oranges, bananas, etc) make it a habit to wipe your blade with at least a damp rag.  People can make the blades of Opinel knives black by putting mustard on it. I used a banana though. Doesn't seem to affect the taste of other food that I cut with that knife."

CampingandHiking,3dknqq,phloem_trig,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:14:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely force a patina on this! I've used oranges, tomatoes, and kiwis -- any acidic fruit you have on hand will do.   I'd also recommend you clean the existing corrosion first. Steel can corrode in different ways, and the black patina from exposure to acid is stable, protective, and won't do deep damage. Red rust is destructive. I'm sure there are other differences/complications but ask a damn chemist. Long story short I'd clean away the corrosion you have in case it is not the desirable sort of corrosion. As for how to remove it, soak in WD-40 or some kind of rust remover. Steel wool. If you're going to force a patina, no need to worry about ruining the mirror finish."

CampingandHiking,3djkhh,panzercthulhu,2,Thu Jul 16 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to start by curbing your expectations a bit: beautiful hiking with close proximity to cities and limited number of people are some proper demands :) I'm also not sure what landscape your hoping for: Fells? Forests? Archipelago hiking? I've often found visitors to Sweden thinking we have one kind of landscapes you'll find all around (but it varies which one they had in mind) and there's an expectation of desolation that might be hard to achieve; proper desolation requires you to head north quite a bit :) We might not be the US, but still, giving tips on the entire country is hard!   Since you haven't specified an area, I'll just give some brief tips. Generally, the right to roam means that you can assume camping is allowed for one night wherever you are unless otherwise specified (Leave no trace!). Also, if the hiking trail is somewhat popular, you can expect well functioning public transportation: don't be afraid to take a bus or two!   Höga Kusten leden ( http://www.hogakusten.com/en/hk/high-coast-trail.html ). Starts in central Örnsköldsvik if you do it northbound. I've not done it myself, but been told that some areas are fantastic, and some are impressively boring. It passes both through natural and cultural landscapes.   Skåneleden ( http://en.skaneleden.se ). Since you arrive by train, you WILL pass Skåne. The trail is great in that it has well established bus or train connections, and fairly simple hiking. Again, Skåne is flat and well populated. No dramatic mountains, and no true desolation. IMO, the Österlen parts or northwestern parts are the prettiest; southwest and northeast of Skåne is fairly boring landscapes if I may say so myself.   Passing on the demand of course proximity to cities (again, getting to the trails is NOT a problem without cars) I'll also list some proper fell hiking if you feel up to it:  Grovelsjon ( http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/en/Discover-Sweden/Facilities-and-activities/Dalarna/Grovelsjon--Rogen/?intro=false ) is simpler hiking, but a wonderful entry to the Swedish fells.  Kungsleden (The Kings Trail/The Royal Trail: http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/en/Discover-Sweden/Facilities-and-activities/Lappland/kingstrail/ ). And I just can't make a post like this without mentioning the Kings Trail, even though it might be a bit off for you. Lappland is properly pretty, and is easier to access than one might think: the night train leaves from Stockholm every day and stops 100 meters from the trail head in Abisko the next day. The weather might be more difficult at times (plan for zero degrees nights!) but there are huts where you can sleep and buy food if things get rough; ultra light packers sometimes do the trail packing only 5-6 kilos (no food, one and a half set of clothes, some sheets and hygiene stuff, and nothing more). Seriously consider it!   If you have more specific questions, ask them and I'll see what I can contribute :)"

CampingandHiking,3dj17j,MeiGuoTheBootyfull,3,Thu Jul 16 17:45:32 2015 UTC,My advice is that you need to do some specific research on the areas you're going to hike in and what sorts of temperatures to expect for the times you want to hike them. My guess is that shoulder season or winter camping is out of reach with your sleeping bag. You're going to need a serious 0 degree bag or lower. The Kelty is a budget 20F bag that probably won't keep you comfortable much below freezing.
CampingandHiking,3dj17j,mvmntsofthemind,2,Thu Jul 16 18:11:33 2015 UTC,"I bought the same bag through the same mechanism. I'm looking forward to getting it.   As a fellow somewhat-northerner (just south of Chicago) and having never done cold-weather camping outside of a heated RV prior to the last couple of years, what I did to prepare was set up a tent in my backyard when it was cold, using the gear I had and planned to bring, then see how things did. Sometimes I was cold, sometimes I was fine. I figured if I'd gotten cold during the night, then I could just walk inside and warm up.   For sleeping, you lose more heat through the ground than up, as your sleeping bag is compressed under your body, so the insulating value is lower. I use a Thermarest Ridgerest Solite under an insulated sleeping pad (I have an Exped Downmat 7, R-value 7.0). Some people say to sleep naked or in underwear, but this makes no sense to me - it's kind of like saying, ""Don't wear layers when it's cold - wear one big puffy jacket (sleeping bag)."" I wear polypropylene long johns, and fleece pants/top with a knit cap, gloves and two layers of wool socks. I've done fine down to 28F in two different 20F sleeping bags, and I sleep cold.   My feet usually got coldest; I found that by taking my winter coat, zipping it up, then placing it over the foot box of my sleeping bag, my feet stayed a bit warmer.  Hope that helps. :-)"
CampingandHiking,3dj17j,eyesontheskydotcom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:59:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you! This is exactly the sort of tip I needed. I hadn't thought of doing a backyard test; though I suppose by the time I'll want it I'll need to test it in MI winter. I'll check out the sleeping pad - I have two but one's an ultralight for summer and the other is a cheap-o foam thing I got as a hand-me-down, and I don't really trust either of them for a winter venture!"
CampingandHiking,3dj17j,eyesontheskydotcom,2,Thu Jul 16 20:44:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even here by Chicago no way to test that cold weather stuff right now - the low tonight is supposed to be 72. LOL.   Definitely check out some various sleeping pads; the higher the R-value, the better, but the price will also go up a lot too. I got my Exped mat when it was on sale at REI, so the price was still up there, but not as bad as full price."
CampingandHiking,3dj17j,gay_for_android,2,Fri Jul 17 13:32:50 2015 UTC,"Before bed boil some water and fill a nalgene, put this in the bottom of your sleeping bag."
CampingandHiking,3dj17j,CivilDiscussions,2,Thu Jul 16 22:31:18 2015 UTC,"Do NOT do this.  If the water leaks and it's freezing, you are in big trouble.  All it takes is a little bit of dirt or ice on the seal. Plus, the water cooling could break the seal.  The water will not just get your sleeping bag wet, but will quickly spread to everything on the floor of your tent including your clothes.  And you will not wake up until it's too late.   If you are backwoods this could mean serious trouble. Hypothermia may not be too far away."
CampingandHiking,3dj17j,ID-10-T_Errors,2,Fri Jul 17 04:25:01 2015 UTC,"I've lived my entire life in Michigan (lower peninsula). I've visited the UP a couple of times in the winter and done some day hiking. I don't do overnights in the winter out of preference (too damn cold).   Here are some warnings about Michigan winter:   It can get really cold at night. Many winters there will be a week or more with lows below -10.  A 20 degree bag will be pretty cold at that temperature.  The lakes make weather that can change rapidly. It isn't unheard of to have 60 degree highs followed by significant snowfall the next day.  It can be windy near lakes. I've been in the Keweenaw Peninsula in winter and the windchill was insane.  Snow gets deep in northern Michigan. Trails should ok, but be careful off trail. A friend and I tried cutting across a lake once. It was a great shortcut until we started breaking through the crust. We spent about an hour fighting through snow up to our waist with crust on top.    Don't want to scare you away, just want to make sure you understand Michigan winters can be rough. I'd recommend some day hiking before tackling overnights. I met some friends of a friend that would regularly camp out on Lake Superior. They wouldn't even bring a tent, just dug shelters in the snow. I think they are insane."
CampingandHiking,3dj17j,ID-10-T_Errors,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:16:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply! I think I've decided that I will use the 20 degree bag for late fall early spring camping out there, and if something should happen in the dead of winter in my house and heat goes out. I'll be moving up into the Keweenaw, so that advice is really relevant to me. I'm thinking of investing in a balaclava and ski goggles (not for skiing...for walking around). I've also just purchase both a winter ski jacket (Columbia Whirlibird Interchange 3-in-1) and a North Face Thermoball jacket to layer underneath that (and then come the merino and silk layers). I hear that layering is the key to Michigan winters. Do you think there are better foot options than just the standard hiking boots I've got? I never really considered winter boots before, but I figured if I had a pair of rain pants or gaiters over my regular gear and layers it's like creating your own snowsuit...  I'm not comfortable doing off-trail stuff just yet, so after your input I'll probably stick to day hiking until I can go with a more experienced friend this winter."

CampingandHiking,3di4oj,gilmoredavid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:57:22 2015 UTC,This is your answer. It works on anything. If its a real stubborn smell get a large plastic bin and put 1 part vineager 10 parts water and submerge for a few hours agetating every once in a while.

CampingandHiking,3debci,banjotec,2,Wed Jul 15 20:57:44 2015 UTC,"Third world countries are any countries not aligned with the Communist Bloc or the NATO. It's a very antiquated term and you probably mean developing country. When the term was still relevant the list of third world countries included Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Finland, Ireland, Austria, ... and other neutral states in the Cold War. Since the fall of the USSR the term is no longer relevant in my opinion.   Peru however is a developing country according to the IMF, I however do not agree with the weight you seem to give their decision. Personally I find HDI a useful tool but it does not paint a complete picture. Let us try anyway. Peru has a high Human Development Index, just one category under the US and most of West Europe (very high), it's on par with Brazil, China, Russia, Turkey, Bulgaria...   It does have it's problems, My country for example warns tourists of potential risks when they intend to travel there. But then again, it has several reservations with among others Japan and the United States as well.  There is a social mining conflict in Arequipa (Tia Maria), so there are protests and blockades. There is drug violence coupled with coca abuse, a problem in much of southern America.   All these problems aside, I think you are overreacting when you just cast risks aside just because they are in a developing country. If you only trust very high human development index countries you'll find yourself severely limited."

CampingandHiking,3dk6ey,atreidesardaukar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:48:06 2015 UTC,Darn Tough Socks makes the Light Hiker Micro Crew Light Cushion sock thats 40% merino wool. They are solid all weather hiking socks.   You shouldn't wear cotton anything. Espciallys socks or base layers.
CampingandHiking,3dk6ey,strickt,0,Thu Jul 16 23:06:22 2015 UTC,It's going to be more about the thickness than the percentage of wool.  You can also get synthetic stuff.
CampingandHiking,3dk6ey,freedomweasel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:27:47 2015 UTC,Thats not entirely true. Wool drys faster then any synthetic material and it is also a natural deodorizer (Good for feet). Thickness is a key factor but Wool is defiantly better then synthetic especially if you think they may get wet.
CampingandHiking,3dk6ey,Fozzy424,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:56:03 2015 UTC,"Wool drys faster then any synthetic material   This is demonstrably incorrect.  A disadvantage of wool is that it takes longer to dry compared to synthetics.  It also generally absorbs more water than synthetics.  http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/comfort_moisture_transport_wool_synthetic_clothing.html#.Vakl7_lVhBc http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/underwear.html  The thickness comment was more for making sure you get thinner/cooler things for summer, so you sweat less in the first place."
CampingandHiking,3dk6ey,freedomweasel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:02:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Ill admit I'm probably wrong then. Its weird because I raft a lot and they always advise me to wear a wool shirt, I thought they had said because it doesn't retain water as much as cotton, but I could be wrong."
CampingandHiking,3dk6ey,Fozzy424,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:05:50 2015 UTC,"Holds less water than cotton, and works better overall compared to cotton for sure.  Wool vs synthetic is more just a preference in my opinion. Though some conditions tend to favor one more than the other.  Nothing wrong with wearing wool on the raft."

CampingandHiking,3digha,dckarg,2,Thu Jul 16 15:13:04 2015 UTC,Typically done in 3 days/2 nights. Some do it in one day. They do have lean-tos along the trail. You can purchase a map from nynjtc.
CampingandHiking,3digha,nyc4life,2,Thu Jul 16 23:17:00 2015 UTC,I just did it with my wife and my dog. There are lean-to's every so often. It was by far one of the hardest trails I have done. We went from 5 am-8pm and we covered half of the trail. About the half way point has a road you cross and there is a camp ground if you want to stay there make a reservation cause they fill up fast.

CampingandHiking,3debba,mi1ksteak,4,Thu Jul 16 20:43:21 2015 UTC,Hmmm. I'm a climber and the rock in BCC is much more yellow/orange like your photo. LCC is more white rock and the canyon is shaped different.  Here is a photo of BCC that I took. https://i.imgur.com/b76Ifz7.jpg

CampingandHiking,3debba,MrShapinHead,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:49:40 2015 UTC,"Nope, that's all quartzite in the picture and Little Cottonwood is mostly granite (or granodiorite if you want to be picky). Other than that, it could honestly be anywhere in the Wasatch except for a few areas such as Little Cottonwood, Lone Peak, or Timpanogos area. Unless someone actually recognizes that exact spot, it could Big Cottonwood or Lamb or Millcreek or Neff's; they all share the same geology."

CampingandHiking,3ditos,rockstew,2,Thu Jul 16 16:50:43 2015 UTC,"They look very similar. Talon is slightly smaller/lighter, but has more pockets/access. Exos is bigger/heavier, but more minimalist on the features. If both of them fit equally well, I'd pick based on which one looks cooler to you."
CampingandHiking,3ditos,pacobriente,2,Thu Jul 16 17:02:17 2015 UTC,"I have the Exos 58 and I love it. The main difference I can see with a quick search is the suspension system on the two. I don't have any experience with the Talon, but I really like the mesh back on the Exos, lots of airflow to keep the back sweat down."
CampingandHiking,3ditos,not_a_relevant_name,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:59:11 2015 UTC,"If you haven't already, go to a store and try them on under load.    I tried the Exos on, and did not like it, it just didn't fit right. the Atmos fit great.    Depending on how much space you'll need for your setup, you might consider a slightly larger pack for ""4 day trips"""
CampingandHiking,3ditos,meyerpw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:20:12 2015 UTC,"How much of a load do you plan to carry? The Talon 44 is my main pack and I love it, but it's designed for the weight-conscious. If you start loading north of 35lbs it starts to get a bit awkward. I've gone as high as 45lbs in it and would not recommend it for that kind of load at all."
CampingandHiking,3ditos,CatSplat,0,Fri Jul 17 15:29:40 2015 UTC,"I would be worried about the size you're looking at.  Unless you are going ultralight a 48L pack sounds a bit small for multi day trips.  Unless you are not the primary pack (eg stove, tent, poles, etc) then I'd be surprised if you could squeeze all your gear in 48L"

CampingandHiking,3di65j,HouseCopeland,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:49:41 2015 UTC,"We thoroughly enjoyed the Mt Eielson Loop  Trip Report and Photos  I'd avoid taking foods that are too aromatic (jerky, fish, etc).  There are a lot of bears.  The Park Service does a great job educating backpackers and the bears are not habituated but one needs to be cautious.  Have a great time!  Denali is an amazing place."
CampingandHiking,3di65j,panafoot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:54:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks /u/Panafoot! Can I ask about the bears? How worried were you, how many Did you see, were there any closer counters, what would you have done differently etc..?"
CampingandHiking,3di65j,panafoot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:45:21 2015 UTC,"I was a bit nervous.  We saw 10 bears during the three days we were out.  We had to change our route twice to stay well away from them.  The best thing you can do is make a lot of noise especially if you are in an area with limited visibility.  We both had trekking poles and banged them together and yelled ""Hey bear"" at regular intervals.  Feels stupid but it is essential.  The Park Service requires you to sit through an excellent short presentation about bears and they tell you how to avoid them and what to do if you encounter any. If you read our trip report you'll see we had a sow and two cubs walk through our camp about 30 feet from our tent.  She obviously knew we were there but was indifferent to us.  I also wrote something specifically about bears which contains a description of a closer encounter we had with a bear in Grand Teton.    I can't say there is anything we would do differently as we followed Park Service advice completely.  We stayed alert and constantly scanned our environment.  We felt like ""prey"" always turning our heads around.  We made noise, carried bear spray and kept all of our food in a bear canister unless we were actively eating it.    Something I think backpackers need to remember when we go into ""bear country"" we are marching through their ""living room"" and it is our responsibility to treat them with much respect.  We need to do our best to avoid an encounter.  The only fatality due to a bear attack in Denali occurred because a lone backpacker didn't do that.  His camera proved that he continued to take photos even while the bear was approaching him.  He should never have intentionally gotten so close.  I was very sorry to hear about the death of another human being but as a result a bear was shot.  To me that is a tragedy."

CampingandHiking,3dhto4,VPerkT,3,Thu Jul 16 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"Hello again, did you happen to decide on a specific AT section?  This time of year, there are quite a few ""Ridge Runners"" that patrol the Connecticut section of the AT. They are volunteers, but are really only there to make sure people are following proper food storage guidelines, and not lighting fires. So in a sense, yes... the AT in CT is pretty heavily ""enforced"" this time of year. Was there a specific place you were hoping to camp, that didn't have any sites near-by? Most of the AT in Connecticut has either tent sites or shelters every 3-4 miles."
CampingandHiking,3dhto4,SailinOn,2,Thu Jul 16 14:31:01 2015 UTC,"CT resident here.  If the CT section of the AT is seriously enforced, then you don't have a thing to worry about anywhere.  I've been on that section a number of times, and never see anybody checking on anything.  Granted, I have only stayed at Riga once....which is the big attraction.  The other campsites between there and Sage's Ravine will be pretty much empty.  Roaring Brook is where I usually stay...and we can sit at those picnic tables all night without seeing another soul."
CampingandHiking,3dhto4,VPerkT,3,Thu Jul 16 14:41:42 2015 UTC,"True, come to think of it, I've only ever seen the ridge runners making rounds at sages ravine and at the riga lean-to. Perhaps ""enforced"" isn't the right word. Either way, if you avoid those two sites you'll likely get an entire site to yourself especially if you go during the work week."
CampingandHiking,3dhto4,SailinOn,3,Thu Jul 16 14:50:33 2015 UTC,"For reals.  Riga is one of the worst spots, but has the best view.  Walk an extra five minutes to Roaring Brook and you've got a luxury suite all to yourself.  A nice, cold water source that will chill a beer in under an hour.  Some clean, newish toilets.  You've got a bear box, two picnic tables, and plenty of tent sites.  It even has good cell service."

The trail goes right up to the top, although I understand why you wouldn't supposed to be up there. If you lose footing it's like a 90 foot drop, it was wild."

So, head west young man, stop by the ranger station for Pike, Arapaho or Roosevelt national forests, and find a camp site.  If you don't see one where you like, you can do dispersed camping just about anywhere.  The maps and brochures you find there will tell you where it's allowed and not allowed.    note, this is bear country, obey the dam rules about storing food."
CampingandHiking,3dg0sj,meyerpw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:37:45 2015 UTC,"Last year we camped at South Fork campground, north of Silverthorne, and really loved it. The key is to get there on Thursday or Friday and get a spot on the creek. The rest of the spots are crappy with no privacy or shade. I think there are maybe 7 or 8 spots on the creek. There is lots of hiking in the area, we especially liked the Ute Pass trail."

CampingandHiking,3de29p,cwcoleman,2,Wed Jul 15 17:34:25 2015 UTC,Is there a brand you would recommend?
CampingandHiking,3desb3,mooncoyote,3,Wed Jul 15 18:30:46 2015 UTC,"It depends...     the PNW has all 4 seasons, often in the same month (or day if you get high enough).       Most beginner hikers don't go out between October and June. At least not above 3000ft. Make sure to understand the NOAA weather report for the elevation you'll be in. Plus there is the whole Avalanche issue, which is something you'll really need to research.            Which brings me to a major point - elevation. It's all about elevation out here. Portland and Seattle are at sea level. The Cascades go over 14000ft on the volcano's. Then there is the desert out East. That's a lot of variability in weather conditions.        The 3000ft level is typically the snowline in winter. Near zero accumulation below 3k, increasing snow (decreasing temps) with altitude.      Rain is obviously a major concern here. You need quality outer layers for both top and bottom. Think GoreTex. Plus wicking layers underneath. I try to go with wool most layers (including underwear, socks, leggings, tshirts, midlayer, and hats). Then a down puffy jacket/vest, or synthetic fill in some cases. A variety of gloves for variable conditions help too.                       I get away with trail runners for the June-October season, but then switch to full leather boots once the snow falls. I even need insulated boots for overnight trips sometimes. Snowshoes are often helpful, although I use my microspikes more frequently (especially since I started skiing over snowshoeing). Gaiters are always helpful - Dirty Girl and OR both make great options. I even have down booties for true winter camping.        I have 2 sleeping bags - a 0F mummy bag for winter trips (it rarely gets that cold below 5000ft) and a 30F quilt for the rest of the year. I highly recommend Montbell for the mummy and Enlightened Equipment for the quilt.      I use 2 sleeping pads in winter - a closed foam for insulation and an inflatable for comfort (and also more insulation). Above freezing trips I take only the inflatable. Therm-a-rest is my top choice for pads.          That tent is great for 3-season trips. Just watch it once the snow starts to fall, it won't hold a heavy dump well. I go with my GF and dog on most trips, so the 3 person is also what I carry.       Good Luck!"
CampingandHiking,3desb3,cwcoleman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:49:39 2015 UTC,"Vancouver resident here. I use a -5 C mummy bag for all of my camping. Bundled up with a base layer on is fine for the shoulder seasons, and unzipped a little for the hotter nights. I use a NeoAir Xlite sleeping pad which I love mostly for its size and weight. Never had a problem with it but there may be better options out there.   For layers it really depends on where you're going, the two main hiking trail types around here are coastal and mountain. When going on the coast expect rain, but more mild temperature fluctuations. In the mountains also expect rain and be prepared for the temp to drop a bit at night. In my experience I'll trust the forecast for the mountains (I'll ditch my rain gear if it's going to be sunny) but on the coast I'll always be ready. I'm a big fan of merino wool for its odour management and performance when wet."
CampingandHiking,3derc4,vauntedsexboat,2,Wed Jul 15 18:24:12 2015 UTC,"I've struggled with this exact same problem for several years now. What I do is just carry 2 lightweight knee braces with me on all overnight trips. (the light compression kind, not the rigid ones) When my IT bands start to flare up (usually on a long descent) I'll stop for a couple minutes, massage them, and put on the braces. It seems to work for me, along with small doses of ibuprofen.  EDIT: And of course, trekking ploles are a must (for me) when carrying a full pack!"
CampingandHiking,3derc4,VPerkT,2,Wed Jul 15 19:22:59 2015 UTC,"You should talk to a doctor and/or PT.  It's better to fix it than keep hurting it and covering it with bandaids.  There are strengthening exercises in the FAQ over in /r/running, but seeing professional is probably wise."

CampingandHiking,3derc4,MotoFox,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:13:53 2015 UTC,I'm concerned that if left untreated this will become a chronic issue.  I also suggest you get some PT.  I used to be plagued with ITB pain when I was a trail runner.  I tried ice and stretching but unfortunately the thing that fixed it was rest.  I had to stop running for a while after spraining an ankle.  The good news is that it has not been an issue since then and I have done many multi day trips including the John Muir Trail.  Perhaps the best thing you can do to prepare is nothing; no running or hiking.  A killer I know but it could very well be worth it in the long run.  It definitely was for me.  Good luck!
CampingandHiking,3derc4,panafoot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:15:52 2015 UTC,"A friend of mine has this issue, and when we went on a 6 dag trip, he actually brought a portable foam roller that really seemed to help.

We planned our backpacking trip months in advance and had to change it when we arrived as one of the passes was still impassible.    If you can pick any area for back country camping, I would shoot for the Belly River or around Kintla Lake (west Glacier near Canada.)  We did the Kintla Lake hike up to Goat Haunt and back and it was beautiful.    We day hiked around Ptarmigan Tunnel (East Glacier) and saw the Belly River.  It was beautiful and I've heard great things about backcountry packing in that area.  That being said, if you can get a site at Many Glacier, it is a phenomenal spot to stay. There are many long --15+ miles---day hikes that you can do in the area with awesome views.    Good luck and enjoy the train!"

Craig Lake is awesome, I only got to day hike it when we were car camping at Van Riper State Park but its on my list to go back and backpack and spend a day or so up at Clair Lake and swim over to the 'private' island. Not to mention taking the road west from the lake toward Nestoria is a trip!  Also I forgot to mention, how did you like the Huron Bay/Peshekee Grade road going up to McCormick?

There are only two main trails out of Onion Valley- a quick 3 mile round trip up to a lake or taking the trail up to Kearsarge Pass where the opportunities are endless. If you want to stay in an area up by Keasarge you'll have to get a (free) camping permit in Lone Pine at the ranger station. No fires up there, too.  We stayed at the Onion Valley campground and it's great: $18/night, a water spigot that's running, pit toilets in good condition. I stayed at campsite #1 this time and it was nice and partially shaded with a great view. The hosts I've met at the site have always been really nice. It's awesome there and you should go.  A few notes:  -Bring some good bug dope and a Citronella candle. The flies weren't above what I normally deal with, but they were aggressive.   -Use the bear box to store your food, less for the bears and more the chipmunks who are acclimated to humans. Also don't keep food in your tent when you're not in it because they might try and chew through it.  -If you plan on hiking further up spend at last a night at Onion Valley to acclimate. Last year when I went up I goofed and we landed at Onion Valley, threw on our packs, and started hiking up. I had never had problems with altitude sickness before so I didn't even think about it. A few miles up I started slowly losing my mind and eventually had to get the fuck down and puked all over my boots. Be smart about it and bring ibuprofen and stay very hydrated.  -try and book a spot online if you can or if you plan on walking in have a backup plan and come early. We got the last site on Sunday and arrived at 2pm.  Take some photos and enjoy it!"

CampingandHiking,3ddtib,BeastroMath,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:09:03 2015 UTC,"If you go to a half decent gear shop they should have various thicknesses of cord by the spool, and they'll cut to any length you want.

CampingandHiking,3ddtib,BeastroMath,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:07:05 2015 UTC,Climbing accessory cord is good stuff.  Anything 5mm and over should do the trick and won't stretch appreciably under body weight (the 7mm I use for climbing is rated to ~2500lbs).  This Bluewater cord is what I buy.

If Outdoor Afro didn't need to exist, then the stereotype would be busted. The fact that a niche group catering to a specific population is newsworthy means the stereotype is absolutely true.   I suppose it's all part of the PC mentality that ""stereotype = pejorative"" when that doesn't have to be the case. A stereotype is simply a generality made based on observed patterns, often there's data that support the idea. It's only problematic when people assume stereotypes apply to 100% of the population in question all of the time.   I was an adult leader of an outdoor youth group based in a school that was 65% black for 6 years - we generally averaged 1 token black kid per year and their common complaint was that they felt isolated.   /rant"
CampingandHiking,3d9p1l,bfuller181,-2,Wed Jul 15 02:25:43 2015 UTC,"There's an argument to be made that camping and hiking are examples of white privilege.  Poor people living in urban areas can't afford the gear or vacation time that these activities require. They're living in shitty neighborhoods, working shitty jobs, and being consistently denied opportunities whites take for granted largely because of race.   From one perspective, camping and hiking represent affordable vacations or forms of recreation. From another, they're prohibitively expensive and difficult to negotiate.  If we fix some of our bigger socioeconomic issues in this country we'd probably see more equal representation in the backcountry."
CampingandHiking,3d9p1l,budshitman,2,Wed Jul 15 03:07:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of an urban/rural thing. I've seen some pretty poor people out on the trails.

CampingandHiking,3d9p1l,feartrich,2,Wed Jul 15 05:23:51 2015 UTC,"That and also the idea of being out in the wilderness and woods does not conjure good memories for black people in America (think lynchings, and the idea of running across white people with guns out hunting, etc.). I know plenty of nature-loving black people, but the idea of being so remote from anywhere, far from a group of their ""tribe"" and most likely among mainly white people is not necessarily enticing.   It might seem silly, but it's also understandable. And of course, it's a real shame. Plenty of the most beautiful places in the world i hike and camp are very white, and even i who encourage my friends to come along do worry about small situations that i would want to be ignored, but that might happen, and i would hate to ruin the possibility of my black friends falling in love with camping by running across ignorant or unwelcoming white people to ruin the experience even in the slightest. Obviously it's something that has to be pushed to overcome, but it's definitely another block we need to stumble over.

Also do a test setup with it (if possible). Kind of important. I'd purchased a Grand Turk unit and the straps at a camping store in San Jose. Finally got a chance to use it earlier this year, and rather glad I did. I brought a tent and the hammock, but I wanted to spend a night out under the stars at my brothers place up in the mountains. (Seriously, he's got an AMAZING view).  So I get it setup. Which is kind of awkward. I have to retie some of the ropes to get it to a safe height, which is fine. Then I finally manage to get in it, with the sleeping bag and my poncho liner (this is a GOOD thing to have, as that back insulation on the bag gets very compressed and it got REAL cold that night). I was comfortable. And sleep. Until about 3am when I woke up with a sudden stop. I'd hit the ground. I thought the knot gave out.  .... The hardware, the physical metal hook, had signs of stress all along the chromed finish, and it was bent out nearly straight. The hammock was rated for 250 pounds, and at the time I was 175. So I setup the tent and problem solved.  I kept the hammock, and have since replaced the hardware with better rated carbiners. A little bulkier, but less chance of failure. and way easier to adjust than a set of hooks.  .... Oh and my parents sent me a Snugpack Jungle hammock for my birthday. Which, if the weather in Washington permits, I will probably take out soon.  So something to keep in mind, ey? :D"

If a bear is creeping on you like it's the case in this video you're better of fight it off. The playing dead trick is more useful when you surprise a bear and want to make sure you don't appear as a threat.

CampingandHiking,3d4ttx,TheSeanis,13,Mon Jul 13 23:36:06 2015 UTC,"You should try to intimidate pretty much any other type of bear EXCEPT a grizzly, normally. Black bears in particular are easily spooked under normal situations.  This dude was incredibly lucky that bear decided not to fuck his entire shit up. The only bear that's more likely to maul you to death just for fun is a polar bear.  Typical advice is: Wolf/coyote - yell/wave arms and if it attacks fight it  Black bear - same as above basically, although some say if it attacks you should lie down and cover, depends on how confident you are in your eye gouging and throat biting.  Grizzly - lie down and cover your vitals  Moose - have a gun with you, cause these fuckers will mow down trees to get you if you catch them in the wrong mood  Polar bear - have a big fucking gun with you, and pray."

CampingandHiking,3d4ttx,TryptamineTea,19,Tue Jul 14 04:13:53 2015 UTC,"Death by grizzly is a really infrequent thing.  You're more likely to die on the car ride to the trail head than be eaten by a bear.  Also, bear spray has been proven to be more effective than a gun against grizzlies. Skurka was carrying bear spray and a trekking pole on this hike.  If we are talking polar bears than I'll agree with you... guns are the answer."
CampingandHiking,3d4ttx,DaYozzie,6,Mon Jul 13 22:34:51 2015 UTC,"I did not realize he had bear spray with him. If I'm in grizzly country, I would want to carry both a gun and bear spray because neither always work. If I remember right the statistics for bear spray was about 85% of cases they scared off the bear and with guns it was about 80%. But that also brings up the question what kinds of gun were in that statistic? If someone brings a 9mm and thinks they'll be safe, they're gonna have a bad time. I know from experience a lot of people don't understand something that small will likely just piss it off. Really it just boils down to doing everything you can to protect yourself. Make distinctly human noises to alert nearby wildlife of your presence, carry bear spray or an appropriate firearm, do not hike alone, and make sure everyone in your group knows what to do in that situation."

CampingandHiking,3d9v63,zomb1,3,Tue Jul 14 17:04:44 2015 UTC,You found the reason these dehydrated meals are not popular - the cost.        Do you not have the option of shopping at a grocery store? Pasta Sides are great options for backpacking. Along with packets (not cans) of tuna/chicken. Classic backpacking meal you can mix and match.        Also note - freeze dried and dehydrated are different products. The process is different and typically freeze dried are more expensive then simply dehydrated.

CampingandHiking,3d9s5a,Fragninja,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:41:01 2015 UTC,"It is! It's my boyfriend's pack and he loves it. He essentially lives out of it for a lot of the year because he travels for work and it's served him pretty well on everything from over nights to week long through hikes like this one. So far it's stood up pretty well to his abuse and it seems really well designed in terms of useful pockets and extra features without having too much going on.  My only complaints about it (at least as far as I've noticed, as it's not my pack) are that it's set up for a lot of extra functionality that you have to buy into ie. it doesn't come with a rain cover, you need to purchase your own elastic cord to take advantage of the bungee loops on the back etc... That and the chest strap system isn't an ideal set up for heavier loads on a pack of this size; my boyfriend's popped off the bag twice on this trip and he had to stop to rethread them. They're easily adjustable for height which is nice, but I think durability wise they make more sense for a day pack. Other than that I think it's a great bag for its price point."

If you want camping without amenities, the Moose River Plains in the central Adirondacks has over 100 free, first-come, first-serve sites.  Most of the sites there are not within sight of each other.  You can stay up to 3 nights or have a group up to 9 people.  Longer stays or larger groups require a permit.  There is some nice hiking and sight-seeing in the area as well."

For forest preserve with designated spots but not regulated, I recommend the Willowemoc on flugertown rd.  A bunch of campsites and they barely get used.  They are right off the road.  Either that or in Sundown on Peekamoose rd (ulster county road 42).  Plenty of spots and parking.  But, they will be packed in season on the weekends. Get there early or midweek for a spot.    When it comes to camping with amenities in the Catskills I am not sure what to recommend. So many, but usually the spots are close.

CampingandHiking,3d9xmg,beeequeue,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:22:10 2015 UTC,Why not do a hike into one of the many leantos in the area? That'd be a great overnighter.
CampingandHiking,3d9xmg,WhitleyStrieber,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:17:40 2015 UTC,Thank you for the suggestion. Got me thinking about spots to try.
CampingandHiking,3d9xmg,DSettahr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:14:01 2015 UTC,"While it is true that you technically can camp anywhere 150 feet from any roads, trails, or water, realistically, this isn't always the easiest thing to do.  Finding flat ground, or an area that isn't covered in dense vegetation can be difficult, especially at higher elevations.  Also, regulations prohibit camping above 3,500 feet in the Catskills as the ecosystems above that elevations are more sensitive to camping impacts.  In general, when you are primitive camped at a location that is not an established, designated site, modern backcountry ethics dictate that when you leave the site, it will not at all be obvious that you camped there- something that typically takes some level of skill.    You especially need to be careful with campfires when you don't have an established fire pit at a designated to use.  The surface organic layer of many soils can be flammable, and simply putting a ring of rocks around your fire often isn't enough to prevent it from spreading into the soils.  You might not even realize that there is a problem and may leave the site, thinking your fire is out, but in reality there area still a few coals burning in the ground that can later spread.  At best, you risk starting a ground fire that can create an ugly burn scar before it goes out.  At worst, that ground fire can spread into a proper wildfire.    Fortunately, there are a lot of designated sites and lean-tos to camp in the Catskills.  Designated sites are well-established sites that have been designated as ""official"" sites that the DEC encourages people to use.  They are marked with a yellow plastic disc that says ""Camp Here"" and they are legal to use regardless of where they are located (even if they are within 150 feet of road, trail, or water).  Lean-tos are also legal to camp in and can make a nice alternative to tent camp (you should always carry a tent or other form of shelter as a backup in case the lean-to you plan to stay in is full).  Also, make sure you familiarize yourself with the backcountry regulations as well as Leave No Trace.  The regulations are written with the intent that compliance will limit impacts that could potentially have significant negative aesthetic and ecological consequences, and there is a lot more to minimizing those impacts than just carrying all of your trash out with you.  Of particular note:   Permits are required for overnight groups larger than 9, or stays in one location exceeding 3 nights. Tents are not permitted inside of lean-tos.  A small, personal-sized bug net is allowed inside the lean-tos (this is actually a good idea during bug season).  Lean-tos must also be shared with other groups up to the maximum occupancy of the lean-to, usually 6-8 people.  (This is why tents are not permitted inside them, as tents often take up more space than a group would use otherwise. All firewood must be dead and down.  Cutting of standing trees, or branches from standing trees, is not permitted- even if they are dead.  Standing dead wood fulfills important ecological functions for wildlife, including as habitat and food sources, and stumps are a visual detraction from the wilderness experience regardless of whether the tree was dead or alive.   You'll definitely want to invest in a hiking map.  The NY NJ Trail Conference publishes a Catskills map set that shows hiking trails, designated tent sites, lean-tos, and water sources.  A good guidebook isn't a bad idea, either- there are several good ones for the Catskills out there published by groups like the ADK and the AMC.    With regards to a specific destination in the Devil's Path area, I would recommend checking out Echo Lake.  It's a somewhat popular spot, but in addition to the lean-to there are 4 or 5 designated tent sites spread around the lake (which is really just a small pond).  You've also got Overlook Mountain nearby, which provides spectacular views out across the Hudson Valley.  You'd be hard pressed to find a better introduction to backcountry camping in the Catskills.   I hope this helps!"

CampingandHiking,3d8lfq,TurnToDust,3,Tue Jul 14 10:21:23 2015 UTC,"Sleeping bags are very dependent on the person.  The sleeping pad is very important for isolating you from the cold ground. The saying is ""a layer below is worth 2 on top"". The sleeping pad you have is great, I have the same one. It is not the warmest but it does a good enough job. Also the way you need to read these labels is important too. Comfort= t-shirt and underwear, not shivering and comfortable body temp. Limit= clothed, light shivering and decent sleep Extreme= fully clothed, constant shiver, awful sleep but will live. So it is really the comfort level that you are after. The other levels are a marketing play to try to sell bags that ""may"" be warm enough. Anyway the -3 is better because it will actually be of use on cooler nights, and the limit is a least in the negatives.  Tents are not really much insulation, unless you have a 4 season with a solid body, or you are burning a warming candle. They do make a difference but don't count on your tent for much real insulation. IMO get the -3 it's worth the 400 grams and little more space, If you are concerned about weight and space, I would recommend a down filled bag.  Good luck out there"
CampingandHiking,3d8lfq,gilmoredavid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:54:09 2015 UTC,"a 50 degree bag (The +3) (comfort) is generally considered a summertime bag and not a 3 seasons bag.   The tent might add a few degrees warmth, and probably assist more in preventing convection of air from moving over you and cooling you that way. The pad adds like 6 Celcius or so to the rating of your sleeping bag usually.  I notice you're looking at synthetics. If you think you can manage moisture well, and I have no idea how damp it gets where you're going and when, you might want to consider down.  If you're still looking at synthetics, then depending on how you sleep a quilt might be a lighter option.   But I'll agree with gilmoredavid, I'd go with the -3 if I had to pull the trigger just between those two."
CampingandHiking,3d7elb,mrneverland9000,3,Tue Jul 14 02:35:28 2015 UTC,"My question is, after finishing it, where do you usually put the finished packages? In a zipperloc, then in the bear canister?   Yes! If you pack it in, pack it out.   Also, where do you place your used toilet paper (srs)? In the bear canister also?   I usually bury it in the cathole with my püps. This may not be full LNT status depending on who you talk to. Dirty toilet paper and human waste are literally the only things I leave in the woods and I think that's okay.   Check out the book ""How to Shit in the Woods"" by Kathleen Meyer. If you wanted to pack out your used TP, I think it would be not that gross if you folded it up properly and put it in a ziploc bag (not the same ziploc as your trash necessarily; I compost my food scraps when I get home from backpacking so I'm already sorting things into compost, trash, and recycling on the trail). And yes, ziploc in the bear canister. Anything that smells goes in the bear canister. Not just food but all toiletries... soap, deodorant, toothpaste, everything goes in the bear canister.   And when sleeping, you should place all of these scented items far far away from your campsite, yes?   What I was taught was to put scented items at least 100ft away from where you're sleeping. Also try to make sure they are downwind of your camp. Some people insist on cooking and eating far away from where they sleep also, which is probably good advice that I've never followed extremely strictly. I don't eat food literally in my tent or sleeping bag, though."
CampingandHiking,3d7elb,mutokangius,3,Tue Jul 14 07:29:18 2015 UTC,"The Mountain House packages are easy to fold up and stuff into a ziplock (make sure you get the ziplock freezer bags rather than the flimsy sandwich bags to keep in odors).   As for TP, it depends on where you're going. If you're in a desert or a dry climate it's preferable to pack it out because it takes longer to decompose. Also, if you're hiking in a well travelled area it would be ideal to take it with you. The more passing hikers the higher the odds of someone digging into a previously used cathole. Honestly, it really isn't that bad to pack it out. I mostly use wet wipes, put the dirty ones in a  zip lock that I keep inside another ziplock. There's no smell.  If you do bury TP it helps decomposition to pour a little water on it and use a stick to stir everything into the dirt.   As for the bear canister, you want it 100 feet away from camp and make sure it's somewhere secure, like in some rocks or a ditch. You don't want a bear to come along and bat it off a cliff or into a river or something. Sometimes people put bright reflective tape on their canister so they can find it case it does get moved.  Enjoy your trip!"
CampingandHiking,3d7elb,cutlass15,2,Tue Jul 14 09:06:35 2015 UTC,"after finishing it, where do you usually put the finished packages? In a zipperloc, then in the bear canister?

In the bear canister also?        Yes, if you don't bury your TP/wipes - I would put it in the bear canister. I have ostomy bags for when I plan on packing out a serious amount of shitty paper. http://www.bagitaway.com/           when sleeping, you should place all of these scented items far far away from your campsite, yes?         Yes, 100ft from camp is a safe distance for smelly stuff. I think of it as a triangle. 1 point for camp (tent / sleeping), 1 point for kitchen (dinner, fire, drinking), 1 point for bear bag/can - All spread 100ft apart. This keeps your sleeping area clear, so that any curious animals will stay away. A bear canister can go directly on the ground. I try to wedge it in a position where it can't roll away easily, but not so much that an animal could use that for leverage to open it. A piece of reflective tape on the can helps to find it at night/early morning."

I am not sure that there is a realistic work around to this, aside from adding a very user friendly system for drawing in unestablished routs. Do you have plans to accommodate for this kind of eventuality?"
CampingandHiking,3d57so,MotoFox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:39:21 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I'm not sure I understand the question.  1) You can switch between a ton of base maps (USGS, USFS, aerials, more)  2) You can switch to point-to-point mode if the Trail Finder isn't snapping to a route you like. You then hand create the points for the route instead."
CampingandHiking,3d57so,MotoFox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:45:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was written poorly. When I have to hand place points I would still like to accurately follow the trail so that my mileage and elevation profile stays true. Doing this can become very tedious and time consuming, is there a way to make that process more user friendly?"
CampingandHiking,3d57so,maxgee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:12:41 2015 UTC,Like maybe a pen drawing tool?

Governor Dodge Sate Park has some reasonably isolated hike in locations, as I recall.       Kettle Moraine State Forest has a few at each of the locations (north and south)."

You'll want to research each one to get a better sense of what each has and how remote it is - I haven't been to more than a  handful of these, as I really made the list for me so I can look at it and say, ""Oh, I could drive 4 or 5 hours this weekend"" or ""Only have a short weekend - better make it inside 3 hours"" or whatever. I included distances from the city of Chicago as I figured others might be interested in this info.   EDIT: There's some places you can reach from Ohio too - I've got that list done, and most of WI is finished, so you've got a decent list to choose from there right now as well."

CampingandHiking,3d5y8h,eyesontheskydotcom,2,Mon Jul 13 21:10:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks - yes, this is my blog. Nothing fancy; I just wanted to document getting started backpacking, and share my trips and what I learn about backpacking with others. I realized I wanted to go more places than the few nearby ones I had hiked/camped. We're not nearly as lucky as those folks out west who have access to the fantastic mountain ranges / BLM land / National Forests out that way. So I figured I should compile a list so those of us in the Midwest can ""make do with what we've got.""  Haven't been to Wisconsin much at all, actually, but the southern part probably isn't much different than down here in the Chicago area. I've camped in October just south of Chicago the past couple of years for a star party, and it ranged anywhere from 50's to 70's in the day all the way down to lower 50's to mid 30's at night. I don't recall it ever freezing/frosting in October, though the star party was early in the month too.   If you've got a 20F sleeping bag and tent, along with some warm/dry sleeping clothes, you should be good. What I did was I ""practiced"" my cold weather camping... in my backyard. If you've got a place you can do that (walk inside to warmth if you get to cold at night), it's a great way to test gear."
CampingandHiking,3d5y8h,eyesontheskydotcom,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:17:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah dude, it's a great site. I'm gonna keep up with it now. Thanks again for sharing.   That backyard test idea is brilliant. I'm gonna do that for sure. What kind of tent do you have? That's the main thing I'm not sure on since the relatively affordable ones don't seem to be good for colder temps."
CampingandHiking,3d5y8h,RobotMayor,2,Mon Jul 13 21:30:16 2015 UTC,"Thank you again about the site, and I appreciate you following me. That will bring me up to an average of 3 people who are not my wife or kids that regularly read it. ;-)  I have a bunch of tents, actually. I picked them up mostly at REI garage sales, so I got the majority of them for pennies on the dollar compared to new. But as others have pointed out to me, it's not the tent that keeps you warm in colder temperatures, it's the sleeping bag. So make sure you get a good one for that. There again, I've opted for stuff on sale, and trying to buy for me and my wife/kids. So I've got a Kelty Cosmic 20 Synthetic (not bad) and a North Face Aleutian 3S (better), with a Kelty Cosmic Down 21 on the way from a recent Massdrop (untested since I don't have it).   I am partial to my REI Half Done 2+, because it's VERY roomy for two people, if a little heavy (but two people splitting the weight makes it manageable). I have a Big Agnes Fairview 1 tent for just me, and if I were to do it over again, I'd probably opt for a Six Moons Designs Lunar Solo LE tent, as I've also discovered the immense benefit(s) of using trekking poles when hiking, not to mention the fact that I could lose 2 pounds of weight if I got the SMD tent.   However, if you're talking about using a tent for snow conditions, I can't speak to that - I've not used mine in snow. That's kind of a different thing altogether as there's different considerations then (making sure the snow slides off, rather than piling up). But my Big Anges is pretty narrow, and it probably would be fine if it snowed unexpectedly."

I went there once for a field trip in high school and have loved it ever since!  I didn't even think about that. My sleeping bag was pretty cheap (about $20), so I probably need to budget for a better one if I'll be sleeping in northern Wisconsin in October. I'll definitely look into your suggestions.   As for snowy weather, I figure an A-frame tent might work out nicely so that the roof isn't a worry. I have a two-person tent, but haven't gone through it in a long time, so there may be pieces missing. I guess the theme of this thread is that I am vastly underprepared, haha."

It has a lot of potential campsites. It is well marked and easy to follow. There should be some thruhikers around this time, for what that's worth."

CampingandHiking,3d7434,DSettahr,2,Tue Jul 14 04:14:04 2015 UTC,"I would recommend checking out Greylock State Reservation in western MA specifically.  The AT runs through there, but there are also a lot of other trails in the vicinity that make for some nice hikes, and allow you to get off the AT, which can be pretty busy at times.    I agree with others than 10-15 miles is a lot for a first time trip.  I would plan an itinerary that has you camped no more than 5 miles from the trailhead.  Remember that backpacking is going to be a learning experience, and you're going to make mistakes on your first few trips... you don't want to be learning from your mistakes when camped more than a few hours from your car, just in case."
CampingandHiking,3d7434,VPerkT,0,Wed Jul 15 13:28:29 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip! Greylock is something to definitely look into.
CampingandHiking,3d7434,mvmntsofthemind,5,Wed Jul 15 18:05:50 2015 UTC,"I would also agree that 10-15 miles per day for your first time out is a little ambitious, depending on how heavy your pack is... I would say 10-15 miles total over 2 days would be a much better option for your first time backpacking. I'm also from CT and am familiar with the terrain in NW CT. Having said that, here's what I would recommend for your first outing:  -Take 2 Cars, park one at the Jug End Trail Head (MA), and park the other one at the Undermountain trail head (Salisbury, CT) -Start at the Undermountain Trail and summit bear mountain, then head down through sages ravine. Climb up and over Mount Race, and then take the side trail down to the Race Brook Falls Campsite for the night. (Day 1: total about 8 Miles)  -The next day, head back up to the AT and head North over Mount Everett, and down to Jug End. Finish at your second parked car at Jug End. (Day 2: total about 8 Miles)  I've done this exact trip 3 or 4 times, and its perfect for beginners, but definitely challenging enough where you'll feel like you've done something significant. The views from Bear Mountain, and Mount Race are spectacular; and Sages Ravine is a really nice place to relax and eat lunch. Enjoy, and make sure to post some pictures to r/campingandhiking!"
CampingandHiking,3d7434,beeequeue,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:22:34 2015 UTC,"This actually might work out perfect for us. However It is measuring at a total of 8.5 miles when I map it on google earth.

Happy to answer any questions you may have. To add on to what's been said, since you have a 75L pack, I am guessing you are carrying a ton of stuff, and you don't have a lot of experience hiking, so I would cap your daily mileage at 10 or less in this type of terrain. If you hike faster then great and you have some time to take in the sights. If not, well maybe you'll avoid night hiking."

CampingandHiking,3d5s35,steveolp,2,Mon Jul 13 19:15:33 2015 UTC,Longest trail in the Fells doesn't even hit 8 miles so you might as well go up to the Whites. 2.5 hours and change.   If you're really out of shape you might want to car camp at a WMNF or state park site and get a super early start on one of the longer loop trails as a day hike.  /r/wmnf might have better answers.

I drive the 3 and a half every few months to get up there and it's totally worth it. In Massachusetts most of the good stuff is a couple hours away in western Massachusetts. And only Greylock or the surrounding areas are worth backpacking IMO. For day hikes I like Mt. Tom and the Holyoke Skinner Range. That'll be a couple hours for some 800-1400 ft. Mountains."

CampingandHiking,3d2lvl,IrishBuckles,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:22:38 2015 UTC,"Very beautiful. When the trail gets above treeline the views are simply outstanding.  This trail can definitely be physically demanding, there were some parts with pretty steep grades, and once you get done with sections 1 -3, you are near 10,000 ft or higher for pretty much the rest of the way. The highest I got before getting off trail was around 12,500 ft, but when I get back on trail to do the San Juan's i'll be doing the high point which is around 13,200 ft.  What ultimately drove me off trail was loneliness. Though there are other people you will meet and pass on the trail, depending on when you leave, this was my first big solo trip and I found I'm just not a solo backpacker (yet, maybe with more experience).  Do it, you won't regret it. I'm definitely coming back to try it again, with a partner.

If it's very cold, make sure you layer well.  I'd take a polyester base layer and then wear whatever warmer layers you have over it.  A hard-shell rain jacket might be be nice if it's supposed to rain, but those can be pricey if you don't already have one, so a decent poncho will suffice.    Also, if you expanded more on what ""hot"" and ""cold"" temperatures were and on some other points in your post it would be easier to give suggestions!"

CampingandHiking,3d522q,lamic,2,Mon Jul 13 16:12:05 2015 UTC,"I think dogs are allowed in most of the Buffalo River area; I know they're specifically NOT allowed in Lost Valley. Indian Creek is IMO the best trail in NW AR; you won't be able to access the really awesome last 1/2 mile with a dog because you have to climb a bluff to get there, but you can get far enough to see several nice pools and falls including Tunnel Cave, and the upper ~2 miles of the trail is in a really cool Arkansas-version of a slot canyon. Triple Falls is worth a visit, it's only a hundred feet or so from the road so don't think you're going to spend a long time hiking it but it's easy access for a beautiful falls (if there's enough flow). Glory Hole falls is a nice walk through the woods for a unique falls and definitely dogs allowed there since it's just USFS property. Pam's Grotto is a fairly short hike (I think also USFS property) but you can spend a while slowly walking back along the creek instead of on the trail, and Haw Creek Falls just across the road is nice too, another 'drive up' falls. Richland Creek might be one you want to check out too. If you get as far south as the River Valley, Petit Jean State Park allows dogs, and the park's Cedar Creek / Falls Trail is nice (but popular!).  If you get sick of waterfalls, Hawksbill Crag is really pretty but many bluffs so your dog needs to be leashed. Same goes for Pedestal Rocks. Back in Petit Jean, Seven Hollows Trail can be pretty lonely (that's a good thing right?) and Rock House Cave is easy and neat. Be warned that hiking in Arkansas in the summer, especially afternoon, can be disgustingly hot and sticky which is why I recommended so many creek and waterfall trails. The water on most of those trails is perfect to wade around or swim to keep cool."

I was planning to camp one night at Kyle's Landing and she told me dogs weren't allowed there but everything I've read seems to make me think they are??    edit: For the record, their website says pets are allowed in the park, it explicitly says no trails - but I don't see anything about dogs being not allowed in campgrounds???

CampingandHiking,3d5so3,strickt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:48:52 2015 UTC,doesnt matter  and yes a tent
CampingandHiking,3d5so3,NotSure098475029,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:53:43 2015 UTC,Well synthetic is usually cheaper. Check out the Marmot Trestle 30. Around $100 and will get you by if your not looking to spend $200-$300.

CampingandHiking,3d4vhc,cwcoleman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:58:45 2015 UTC,"I'll 2nd the head net.  Wear it over a hat with a brim that keeps the net from resting on your skin, and the bugs are a non-issue."
CampingandHiking,3d4uzq,taxandhike415,2,Mon Jul 13 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"Start early, the heat will be brutal. Take lots of water and refill every time you get to water.  Stay on the trail and don't go in or anywhere alone. (These are the two top ways hikers die in the Canyon.)  Make sure people know where you are going and when you will be back.  You will also need permits to camp below the rim. Make sure you have those."
CampingandHiking,3d4uzq,realoldfatguy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:35:55 2015 UTC,"Okay, thanks these are all great tips. We are waiting to hear back about the permits now, and we will definitely stay together and drink tons of water/salty snacks. So even though it will be brutal, do you think it is still worth it as opposed to going somewhere else nearby? I have hiked the Grand Canyon twice (but never all the way to the river), but my buddy has not been."
CampingandHiking,3d4uzq,realoldfatguy,2,Mon Jul 13 16:08:48 2015 UTC,"It is amazing to see the sunrise from within the Canyon.  I did a Rim to Rim hike in a day and we started at about 4am, hiking the first hour or so in the dark.  We hiked in October and even then needed to make sure we were past the ""Frying Pan"" before noon/1pm. It still got ugly going through that section (this is just before Cottonwood Campground)  Remember, the deeper you get into the Canyon, the hotter it will get. If you can get down to your camp before noon, then sit back and relax in the shade, you should be good.  On the hike back out, plan for at least another hour or two.  Right now, you are looking at temperatures over 100 at Phantom Ranch."
CampingandHiking,3d4uzq,panafoot,2,Mon Jul 13 16:16:39 2015 UTC,"We've backpacked over Memorial Day weekend and it was brutally hot then but well worth it.  My advice is carry extra water to soak your shirt and head regularly and wear a broad brimmed hat.  Keeping a wet bandana around your neck can help as well. Eat salty snacks and take electrolyte capsules because you will sweat a lot and hyonatremia is a dangerous condition. Rest in any shade you encounter. If you hike straight from Bright Angel Campground to the rim then plan to take a long break at Indian Garden and be prepared to hike up the rest of the way in the dark so take headlamps.  Are you talking about later this month?  If you don't currently have a permit then I question whether or not you will get one.  Bright Angel and Indian Garden are the most popular campgrounds in the park and people request permits 4 months in advance.  However, I have never tried for a permit in July so don't know how big of a damand there is.  If you don't get an advance permit then you might be able to get one of the few walk up permits available but that usually takes a few days and involves getting on the waitlist  Details are on the NPS website about half way down the page.  Good luck!"
CampingandHiking,3d4uzq,panafoot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:48:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much. This is awesome advice. I am planning on getting a wide brimmed hat before I go to go to wear along with my buff. Any favorites? I will get electrolyte capsules, salty snacks, and read up on hyonatremia before as well.  I am talking about later this month. We just submitted the request to go on a Tuesday and Wednesday so are hoping to get lucky, but if not, we will likely just do an overnight at one of the campsites 4-6 miles into the canyon and just won't get to the river this trip."

I was just saying most people don't realize how big they are or how dangerous they can be. Everyone is afraid of bears usually and worried they will get eaten so it's the go to comparison. Nobody is ever afraid of moose, until you see one in person and realize this wild animal is about 7 ft tall and not being deterred your presence usually."
CampingandHiking,3czrd4,beansisgood,2,Sun Jul 12 15:12:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Especially people who aren't around elk, moose, and even deer. Cow moose can be extremely aggressive if they have a baby moose with them. Every time I come across one while I'm hiking I give it a bunch of room."

CampingandHiking,3czrd4,Llort2,2,Sun Jul 12 15:51:11 2015 UTC,I was hiking with a group in Wyoming one year. We stopped to camp next to a lake and had just finished setting up our tents when a moose cow decided to take a run through our camp.   Everyone is screaming and jumping behind trees while the moose runs around tents and then eventually jumps over [read: stepped over] a tent and then runs down the trail. I remember thinking my god that animal is huge. Then I moved to Alaska and the moose there make other moose look tiny.
CampingandHiking,3d0zyp,abXcv,14,Sun Jul 12 16:53:48 2015 UTC,"Stretching is so important. Hamstrings, calves, quads, glutes, hips for speed/durability and that joint pain. I'll bet with a good stretch routine you'll be pain free in 2 weeks. Traps and neck stretch for that mailbag.  If you don't already, I would also suggest adding a daily workout routine to assist. Something simple to do before breakfast like the following: 10 body squats 10 pushups 10 situps 10 lunges 10 flutter kicks As you get stronger repeat that circuit or add more repetitions.  As for enjoyment, get spotify on your phone and listen to some different music. Notice the clouds and keep a smile on your face. Keep a positive attitude."
CampingandHiking,3d0zyp,thirdbestfriend,7,Sun Jul 12 17:18:26 2015 UTC,"This is key! Also try rolling with a foam roller. I started rolling my IT bands on a semi-regular basis and the knee pain vanished. Stretching lower back is good for hamstrings. Stretching/massaging your pecs is good for your trapezius, which is good for you neck.  It's amazing how your muscles are interconnected.  Also, before your see an MD, try bodyworkers: massage, rolfing, physical therapists, etc. Good ones are trained in anatomy and can suggest stretches and exercises to stabilize and strengthen.  Edit: Also, YOGA!"

CampingandHiking,3d0zyp,uspt87,5,Sun Jul 12 21:09:40 2015 UTC,"Change your insoles more often. Your shoes may be fine, but your insoles - by this I mean the inner cushion that your feet are actually walking on - will lose their absorbency after awhile.   You may be wearing too many layers of socks. If you're wearing all that because you're looking for comfort, the insoles probably (definitely?) need to be swapped out.  Instead of tights, look into compression socks or leg sleeves.   What sort of shoes are you wearing? If you're getting injured on the job, you may want to consider getting hiking boots to help support your ankles.   As far as injuries and preventative care go, you should be talking to your doctor about that. Maybe see if you can get a referral to a sport doc who specializes in joint care.  Bag - I have seen some postmen using a rolling cart instead of a bag strapped over their shoulder. Maybe requisition one and see if it's more comfortable to use."

The Dr. Martens are long lasting and durable, but not the most comfortable and pretty heavy. Carrying excessive weight at the feet will fatigue you more quickly than anything else.

It sounds like you're wearing a lot of socks.  Make sure they're all wool or polyester.  This will keep your feet from chafing.

CampingandHiking,3d0zyp,im_a_tree,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:46:13 2015 UTC,"When you add extra layers of socks on top of an already thick shoe (doc marten), you are really isolating your foot and not allowing it perform it's job. I'm really a fan of going minimal as possible to promote a natural gait and strength in your foot. I would think this would lead to less injuries and would feel far more comfortable. Be careful if you make a change to that though. Make the transition slowly to allow your foot to strengthen and adjust. If you wear shoes in the house, try switching to socks or barefoot to help with the transition."

Had trouble finding the trail up to the Lion's Head, but made it up there for our last stop. Spent the night on Breathed Mtn, and awoke to great weather for our last day of hiking.   Barely took any photos on Day 1-2 because I didn't want to get my phone wet.

That's essentially exposure therapy for fearful situations, which is THE way to overcome phobias in the traditional psychotherapeutic sense."
CampingandHiking,3d2m28,bonsai_blog,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:00:39 2015 UTC,fantastic advice.
CampingandHiking,3d2m28,themoreweexplore,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:11:47 2015 UTC,White noise seems to be great too. Our last trip we were lake side and even though the sounds of the woods were still present there was a constant sound of water that she said helped a lot.
CampingandHiking,3d2m28,themoreweexplore,3,Mon Jul 13 01:20:58 2015 UTC,"I can totally relate. I have a few suggestions.  1) Educate her on the dangers of the woods and how to prevent against them. Usually the fear of the unknown is more scary than actually knowing what's out there (or most of the times what ISN'T out there) and how to protect yourself. Bear spray goes a long way for helping me get a good night's sleep in the backcountry. I'm betting 99% of her behavior is a mental thing. Learning that there's not much out there that's scary, and reviewing the behavior of predators and threads helps us learn what's real, and what's made-up in our heads. Bears don't go walking into campsites looking to eat humans. They go into campsites looking for food. So if you understand that, and learn how to store the food away from where you sleep, you can worry less that bears (or whatever) aren't going to wander in trying to kill you. I only mention bears because they're usually what I'm most afraid of.  2) Physical activity before bed. When I hike a good 10-15 miles before going to bed, my body is a lot more receptive to sleep. On the other hand, if I drive straight to a camp spot with no hiking, set up my tent and pad, and try to go to sleep, I don't fall asleep 'till 3AM sometimes. I need time to wind down and get tired.  3) Get a great pillow/sleeping pad. Everyone is different, and everyone will have different needs, but for me, the Klymit Cush seat/pillow completely transformed my sleeping while camping. I'm a side-sleeper and it has been a game-changer.  4) Stay up later. There's no set bedtime when camping, and you can wake up whenever you want. If I'm camping with a fire, I'll keep it going 'till 1-2AM until I get tired. Once I'm tired, it's a lot easier to crash.  5) Earplugs. As you mentioned, sometimes earplugs help me, but sometimes I'm just too worried about the noises around me. It's amazing how loud a tiny bird or squirrel can sound at 2 AM; it sounds like 10 bears running at you full bore. :)  6) Have a tent. When I sleep under the stars in the woods, I sometimes feel more vulnerable than when I'm in a tent. I realize that extra 1mm of nylon isn't going to protect me, but sometimes it's enough to let me mentally block out what's going on out there. Hope some of this helps."

To get nice clear Milky Way photos you need a fast lens, a long shutter time (~30 seconds) and it helps if you take multiple exposures and stack in photoshop (or some other photo editing software).  My Milky Way shots were done with a EOS-M with a 22mm f/2.0 lens (@ f/2.0), with a 30 second shutter time.  Most of the nights during our hike a light upper level haze and a SUPER bright full-moon killed any chance at catching the Milky Way.  On our last night the sky was clear and the Moon was blocked behind a perfectly placed ridge!  Had about 45 minutes to take Milky Way pics after the sky darkened and before the moon peaked over the crater ridge."

CampingandHiking,3d1oo0,pihungry_eadvancing,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:19:32 2015 UTC,"What someone wears depends entirely on environment. How, exactly, is cotton going to kill me when the temperatures never dip below 80º?  I switched to cotton/poly blended shirts several years ago (and tank tops this year) and couldn't be happier. They are more comfortable and breathable than synthetics, and keep me cooler. Keep in mind this only applies to the hottest months, in high humidity. Much of the deep south is considered sub-tropical. In this part of the country, nothing is going to dry out. Synthetics don't have an advantage. Cotton isn't ideal because of it's abrasiveness and weight when wet, but it's still better than being suffocated by a shirt."
CampingandHiking,3d1oo0,mrjowee,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:54:00 2015 UTC,"OP said nothing of the South. Cotton, as compared to synthetic materials, do not dry quickly, do not breathe when wet, are not comfortable when wet and hold water like a sponge all while maintaining a great habitat for bacteria. The only pro for cotton material for hiking, especially for multi-day use, is the price."
CampingandHiking,3d1oo0,pihungry_eadvancing,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:16:52 2015 UTC,"OP made a carte blanche statement, which by default includes the South. Florida is the second most populous state in the country.  No, cotton/poly blend shirts (I'm not advocating 100% cotton) do not dry. Neither does wool or synthetics when the humidity is so thick you can taste it. Sometimes synthetics will dry over night, but as soon as you start hiking theyre soaked within ten minutes, again because nothing dries.  Blended shirts breathe better than synthetics, even when wet. I know from experience.   A blended shirt will retain it's shape when wet, at least enough to keep it's shape and not cling to the wearers body. Also, they breathe.  Thank god they hold water! It's hot as fuck and water conducts heat much better than air. It's the reason people dunk their shirts in rivers and such when hiking in the Southwest.  Bacteria grows more easily on synthetics. Why do you think they stink?  I've hiked a lot with cotton, so I know it performs better under certain conditions. Meanwhile you've never even hiked in this environment yet you start flapping your gums about how I'm wrong. Wonderful."
CampingandHiking,3d1oo0,mrjowee,0,Mon Jul 13 02:21:16 2015 UTC,"Dude. What you are saying doesn't make sense. The reason why sweat cools the body is because it evaporates... Water on cotton doesn't evaporate as fast as synthetic. Dunking in a river works only when the water is cooler than the air... as soon as it warms on your body you're back to being suffocated. There is a very good reason why zero professional athletes wear cotton. I also live in the south. Raised in Ocala, FL. I know what I'm talking about here, man. Lots of experience."
CampingandHiking,3d1oo0,pihungry_eadvancing,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:25:04 2015 UTC,"Athletes avoid cotton because it's abrasive, not because it's hot.  I know what I'm talking about not because if where I grew up, but rather because of what I've worn while hiking in subtropical conditions. If you were from Fl, and have hiked in the summer, you'd know that nothing dries off during the day."
CampingandHiking,3d1oo0,mrjowee,0,Mon Jul 13 14:08:38 2015 UTC,"Almost nothing dries out in high humidity. True. So why would you fight the body's already failing cooling process (due to slow evaporation) by wearing a cotton shirt with literally lbs of water on it that allows little airflow through it?

Selling off national parks is possible, but the political damage would be huge to whoever does this.  The proposal you link to is related to selling BLM, FWS, and National Forest lands back to the states and local governments, as some conservative states would love to develop some of those lands. National Parks and wilderness areas are exempted. That's totally different from ""sell the national parks and monuments to the highest bidder"". Also, the sales (some of which were already done during the Bush administration) are almost always done at a discount rate, because the states have limited budgets for this kind of thing.  The BLM etc can already basically ""sell"" their land without Congressional approval just by granting leases and land rights. So if they really wanted to ""sell to the highest [private] bidder"", that's something they can already do; it's just that the Obama administration and the leaders of the BLM don't want to do this."

Conservative hunters and sportsmen are generally strong supporters of federally managed lands (though they probably support development of some of those lands). Again more votes.

Land use laws often apply to people who aren't using public lands anyways, it's really moot depending on where the land is located. Land use laws give broad powers to locally based agencies, so local BLM directors have power to change regulations as they see fit.  My point is not that these land sale bills are good or even tolerable, but that those bills will probably never pass if the 2016 presidential elections are won by a pro-business candidate. This was how the Sagebrush Rebellion ended. Reagan was elected, and his Secretary of the Interior Watt (a horrible man) decided to open up millions of acres of land to development.

Parks, forestry, BLM, all of those are existing on such dismal budgets, they typically hire for 3-6mo positions seasonally for everything less than MS required levels, positions that would take a considerable amount of training if education and experience didn't count. Don't get me wrong, though, I am very happy for those that get the job and are well suited for it. Just keep in mind that veterans preference has lead to some serious issues as it currently stands.  Most of my friends and aquaintances who are vets, however, do not want to work for the govt ever again, and I can understand why. My favorite success story about this is a young lady vet from the big island of Hawaii, who, after one application was given a 2 year park ranger position at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park where she could do interpretive talks about the park and it's personal cultural significance. I met her on her first day. She had recently finished with the army and came home to take care of her sister's family. After searching high and low, she applied to one of the most competitive positions in the NPS and was able to take it, thanks to vets preference. It's only a bus ride away from her home. She was almost in tears.  As a civilian, I feel very conflicted over this preference. I want my vet friends to be employed, but I also want the people employed qualified and able to do their work. I believe that longer term positions would solve most of this conflict. It better happen fast, or there won't be anyone left to do the training."

It sounds like the way things are currently set up isn't very well thought-out, even if it's doing a lot of good in some cases. I hope there's a solution that works out better for both the parks and veterans."

CampingandHiking,3d0qtj,SixBiscuit,3,Mon Jul 13 09:37:30 2015 UTC,"Subculture has certain undertones of defining ones self by something. I do all things. I'm not a ""biker"" or ""car guy"" or ""gamer"" or ""hiker"" or whatever. I do all things, and participate in a range of activities. The irony is how you're creating walls for yourself by using an activity which is supposed to define one as unbound. I am a hiker as well as a biker. I've done the AT for stretches.  Fact of the matter is she is a girl from a well to do family, decided to hike the AT by herself, and made some poor choices in regards to other people. The real irony is that she could have been in just a bad of situation with me."
CampingandHiking,3d0qtj,SixBiscuit,-4,Mon Jul 13 12:16:41 2015 UTC,"Well if you want to play it that way sure. We can play it that way. You decided to warn people about hiking alone which if you'd ever been on the AT for any decent stretch of time during thru hiker season you'd know has absolutely no meaning but you keep repeating that like it's important to the facts at hand. Kind of shows me that while you may have hiked some stretches of the AT you're not exactly in a position to be throwing around advice.   Second the advice you've come with is pretty shitty advise and pretty offensive advice. Your implication is clearly that you better be paranoid and fearful of hiking alone and meeting strangers on the trail is as trite as it is meaningless. So while you may trot out a pedantic distinction over the connotations of ""subculture"" and ""identity"" you're not exactly pushing back against the whole ""biker is a nice guy who does a nice thing"" narrative you've got going.

( my store is in the GTA and we don't get that brand) I especially like the Nallo 3. I think a 3 person will have enough room for you and your gear and will also be useful later on for your own camping trips.  As for sleeping bag  I like the sawtooth (-9c) or scandium (-7c) from marmot.  As others have mentioned layers are the best way to go, starting with  merino wool baselayer like icebreaker (200 grade) top and bottom. I like to go with a down midlayer and a waterproof shell for outer layer, for example the ceruim hoodie and the Theata AR jacket from Arc'teryx.  Do you have to work with steel toe boots? if not consider getting good mid cut hiking boots (no need for backpking boots since you're not carrying much. hard to give a recommendation there since its really based on comfort, I like  Scarpa myself. with that a few pairs of icebreaker or smartwool hiking socks. I would make sure to bring a small stove for coffee something like jetboil or pocket rocket from MSR..(this is crucial for me I love my coffee when I'm camping..) since you don't need to carry all this in a backpack, i would take a the north face base camp duffel bag (a size large would do) that should be enough room to carry all your gear and those things are bomb proof... that's all I can think of right now..let me know if you have any questions."

I'm not saying I don't see people make comments about girls in pictures. But in this context it's not the same thing, we have a picture of a waterfall with a blurry person. The guy/girl who made the joke doesn't make any comment on the person in the picture other than that he can't see them very well from the picture and insinuates that the OP meant the beauty in their title was the person rather than the waterfall.

Bear left at the split and when you get to the next intersection that's when we started heading up to the gorge. You'll pass a small fire pit along the water. Took probably 30 minutes to get to the bank and another 30 to the falls. It's slippery and questionable at times so be careful! We were lucky the water was low enough.

The ATC's Parking, Shuttles, and Transportation page is a good spot to start.  There's a Shuttle List pdf linked there that will have commercial shuttle services in the area.   Backcountry Outfitters in Kent might be good guys to call.  They'd probably have ideas for good pick-up/drop-off spots.  The CT-MA border is definitely the more remote of the two.  You may find that it's easier to just hike the extra day north in MA to get to Great Barrington.  There's bus service out of there."

If you don't want to add a day by going up to Great Barrington as someone else suggested, you could look into getting a ride from the trailhead back to the Wassaic Metro North station (25 minutes or so), or to Canaan CT (10 mins), where there's daily Greyhound service into NYC. There are a couple of taxi services in Lakeville/Salisbury that aren't terribly expensive that you could schedule in advance."

CampingandHiking,3ctx7n,DSettahr,3,Sat Jul 11 04:16:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly... a 30 mile through hike isn't really an ""ideal"" first time backpacking trip, especially if it is the first trip for all involved.  Three consecutive 10 mile days across remote and rugged terrain with multiple 6,000 foot peaks can be a lot for even experienced backpackers that are used to the weight of a full pack.  The other thing is that backpacking is a learning process, and this is never truer than your first trip.  You're going to be making mistakes and learning from them, you're going to be learning about your physical and mental limits, and you're going to be refining your gear load-out to better suit your needs.  You don't want to be 15 miles into a 30 mile trip with limited bail out options when you discover that your boots give you massive blisters, that you've got the wrong kind of stove for cooking the meals you brought, that your pack doesn't fit you quite right, your sleeping pad really isn't that comfortable, that you really aren't in good enough shape to be doing 10 mile days, etc.    There is nothing wrong with wanting to do hikes like the Art Loeb Trail, but being able to do them both comfortably and safely is something that takes at least some experience.  I would strongly encourage you to refine your first trip into something that amounts to a ""gear field testing experience.""  Pick a destination that is no more than 5 miles from the trailhead, hike in and set up camp, and stay there for a night or two.  Try out all of your gear and get used to using it, and make decisions about what to do differently on your next trip.  That way, your car is no more than 3 hours away if anything goes wrong and you need to break camp and hike out unexpectedly.    Whatever you end up doing, make sure you look up the regulations in advance.  Not doing this is a common beginner mistake.  In particular, there are generally regulations about where you are allowed to set up camp (typically you must be at least a certain minimum distance away from water and off the trail), and whether you are allowed to have fires or not.    Also, please take the time to familiarize yourself with Leave No Trace.  Our impacts in the backcountry can be significant even if we mean well.  There is a lot more to minimizing your impacts than just carrying out all your trash."
CampingandHiking,3ctx7n,DSettahr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:22:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is what I was looking for. Any suggestions for the gear testing experience hike? I live in South Carolina and the Art Loeb seemed like the closest good hike I could find."

CampingandHiking,3cup9t,scwuffypuppy,6,Fri Jul 10 22:46:33 2015 UTC,"The absolute very best way to prevent wear to your snowshoes is to learn to ski.  Skiing also has the tremedous benefit of not being snowshoeing.  The next best way to avoid wear is to use your snowshoes on snow.  There is no way that the wear shown is from snow.  I highly doubt that it is even from vegetation.  Those snowshoes look like they have been used on gravel.  Were they part of a rental fleet, or owned by an institution?  You can probably get away with doing nothing, as long as you use your snowshoes on snow in the future.  Not hard-packed snow-covered roads, but actual powder snow.  Since the damage is already done, though; here's how I'd fix it: / keep it from getting worse.  Pry the fabric away from the tube.  Maybe you can get a couple toothpicks or a popsicle stick between the fabric and the aluminum.  Get some flexible epoxy.  I would use West Systems G-Flex, because it is really good stuff (and I already have it around the house).  Mix it up, and paint it on the affected part.  If you don't have flexible epoxy, Aquaseal or seam grip would provide a bit of protection (but not much).  If you happen to have hypalon paint, that would work, too.  Source: I own a 37 year old hypalon raft, one pristine pair of snowshoes, and lots of skis."

CampingandHiking,3cup9t,cwcoleman,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:24:59 2015 UTC,good lord I agree with this in every way!     It was on a snowshoe trip where a group of backcountry skiers blew past us that I took up the sport of skiing. Took lessons and practiced at the local resort - and now I am backcountry ready. Snowshoes are a last resort.       Plus that damage is not from snow. Sure you may need to step on a few rocks between snowy sections on a trail - but nothing like that. Those were beaten to death by stone.
CampingandHiking,3ctwqf,HauntedCemetery,2,Fri Jul 10 19:11:44 2015 UTC,"I think that often the default choice is vegetarian - adding meat is what often makes preserving the food difficult. But pasta, instant mashed potatoes, peanut-butter based stuff, most easily preserved stuff can made most easily as a vegetarian meal.  What are you looking for exactly? You could:  Buy premade meals, like mountain house, or other companies.  Buy components, like pasta and some form of cheese that won't go bad easily, and make mac and cheese, which is cheaper but a little more complicated.  Make a meal yourself at home, and preserve it using a food dehydrater.  Whatever you do, make a variety of meals so you won't get tired of them."
CampingandHiking,3ctwqf,Acies,2,Fri Jul 10 19:34:20 2015 UTC,"I like dehydrated black beans with a dehydrated can of Rotel along with instant rice and nice tortillas.  You can make back country tacos!  If you like spicy, I'd add some jalapenos and onion to the beans as they're cooking and dehydrate that too.  Don't skimp on the tortillas - the nicer, the better.  Heat up water and rehydrate beans and veggies for a few minutes before adding instant rice.  Add salsa (either packets or a bit dehydrated) and spoon onto tortillas."

CampingandHiking,3ctlog,eeesong,4,Fri Jul 10 17:51:24 2015 UTC,The last version of the Jam wasn't really all that good in my honest opinion-it had become a bit overweight for a frameless 50L backpack.  A close match to it (and a better pack) is the ULA CDT-also a frameless 50L pack but better engineered and can be stripped to make it lighter.    As to other options-plenty of good ultralight packs out there.    Zpacks  Gossamer Gear  Six Moon Designs  The REI Flash 45 is a great budget alternative-not quite ultralight but can be found on discount all the time.
CampingandHiking,3ctlog,pto892,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:30:36 2015 UTC,I have a flash 45 that I use and it's a pretty solid pack. I use it for when I have a low gear weight setup but still need a bit more volume. This usually means no more than a few nights.    The biggest advantage is really the price. It's regularly on sale and I've seen them at the REI used gear sales for 1/2 off of a brand new pack. You can go lighter but it probably fits a lot of people's needs.

Couldn't they hike to a high enough vantage point to see the Tetons well enough to get their bearings straight. Or just hike towards the Tetons knowing you will get to the Park/roads/etc. in a relatively short time?   Jackson local here. Familiar with the area they were in. Honestly I don't what the fuck they were doing/thinking. Again, I'm glad they are ok, but still miffed about how they got themselves into this. Some thoughts-   Planned 5 day backing trip in an unfamiliar place- tell someone where you are going!!! People were driving to every trailhead within an hour of Jackson looking for their car. Who goes on a 5 day backpacking trip in an unfamiliar place without a topo of the area/compass?(I'm making assumption here based on the fact they were lost AF) They were found miles and miles from any trail- see map Why would you go miles off trail without having your shit together? They were only 4 miles or so from the road, and were found on top of a minor peak. All they had to do was follow one of the adjacent drainages/creeks downhill and they would have been on the highway/river. Should have had a damn good view of the lay of the land. Even if they didn't have a map, again, the highway and river are in a major canyon right below where they were. I'd be surprised if they couldn't see headlights from the two adjacent highways. Hey, I wonder whats at the bottom of that canyon right there? The f'n road. What side of the highway were we backpacking on? The north side. How do I get back to civilization? Walk a couple hours south....   Again, I'm very glad they are ok, but the level of incompetence and poor decision making they exhibited is just ridiculous.  They had a search party of 100 people, heli's, etc out there for a situation they could have easily avoided and escaped from themselves. I'm hoping they do an accident report/write up on what happened and what they were thinking."
CampingandHiking,3couwd,nomansslave,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:44:59 2015 UTC,"I live here in the area.  First, they have been found.  I was contacted by the Sheriff's Department on Thursday for help but was out of the area.  They were ultimately found in the Granite Creek area but headed the wrong way and got lost, but had been seen by a guide working on a trail.  They are fine.  The Tetons most certainly cannot be seen from that area.  They were not in the Teton range and this area is quite mountainous with 7 different ranges in the rough area near the Tetons.  They were prepared equipment wise but not map or orientation wise.  Even something as simply knowing if they were heading west or east or north or south would have made a difference as if they headed one direction they would have ended up at one highway, another direction at another, and so on, if given enough time and no injuries.  Granite creek runs into the Hoback which runs into the Snake.  They headed somewhat south then east, a direction that would cause problems as they were headed away from roads."

It's heavy (more than 7lbs with bag/stakes), but it's also the most spacious and only truly free-standing shelter I own (on backpacking trips I usually do the ultralight tarp/bivy thing), seemed like a good choice given that we were originally planning to car camp at a BLM site for this trip.

But the truth as I've seen it and as you probably have too is that nothing ever happens. I never have a problem with animals or people and it's always scary but it also always turns out to be fine. Start out with a loop or something small distance so you have the security of being able to bail if you get really worried. Bring mace if you like."

I do a fair amount of solo backpacking (just short overnight things no big deal). I can't tell my family I'm going because they get so worried I'm gonna be slaughtered by axe murderers even though I live most of the year in a sort of ""dangerous"" city, I just tell them that I'm out with friends and I'll crash at their place.   I've never had a problem, and I've noticed that it's mostly only non-hikers who think its dangerous. However I have heard stories about female through hikers being creeped on when they go through towns but never any stories about other hikers being weird/creepy.

CampingandHiking,3clsvp,Al_frappaccino,2,Thu Jul 9 01:38:05 2015 UTC,"Sure! The hike was about 8 miles total. For the ascent we took the Sunset Ridge(?) trail to get to the Chin (the highest peak), and then we went back down the other side towards the Lake of the Clouds before heading back over & down. On the way down we took a short-cut trail but I can't remember the name of it. The descent was steep & very slippery at the trail we took. I'd recommend checking it out, especially if you plan on camping at some point. I did the whole hike with a few people & full backpacking packs without much issue. It's definitely not an easy relaxing hike but anyone who's up for the challenge will find it well worth it when you get to the top."
CampingandHiking,3clsvp,the_gv3,2,Thu Jul 9 03:28:44 2015 UTC,"The trail you took down was probably Hellbrook, which is recommended only for ascent.  Obviously you can get down it, as you did, but it's better to go the reverse route that you did.  Great views up top though, eh?  You can easily see across Lake Champlain into New York and also Mt. Washington over in New Hampshire on clear days."

CampingandHiking,3cq4ak,meekosmom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:42:10 2015 UTC,Good trails with viewpoints? Of course Olallie Mountain comes to mind off the top of my head for mckenzie area hike.  If you are near the santiam area Iron Mountain is a favorite of mine. If you are hiking in the Gorge you are either hiking to a view or a waterfall pretty much.  Maps available at the trailhead? No. Unless you count a crappy map stapled to it at the sign and that often isn't the case.  Recreation passes? Most trailheads will require on either 5$ per day per vehicle (can be paid at most trailheads) or 30$ for a year(can be found at ranger stations or REI). Crater Lake will be a national park fee which is different.  Terrain ok for dog? I would say 90% are ok for a decently behaved dog.  The exception would be some places in the gorge.  The gorge has some holy shit balls it is steep areas as well as hiking along cliffs.  Honestly I haven't done enough Gorge hiking to say where to go yet. I would avoid the mckenzie river trail.  Last time I went I was constantly pulling over for mountain bikers.  Where are you camping in the Willamette forrest?  I know that area the best. I would also recommend icking up 100 hikes in the central cascades it might give you some good ideas.

CampingandHiking,3cjrir,realoldfatguy,20,Wed Jul 8 14:19:05 2015 UTC,"Sure! It's part of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. It's (I think) the one campsite on the mainland, at the end of a 5 mile trail. My girlfriend and I are relatively new to backpacking/hiking/camping so it was a little challenging for us as far as navigating went. They told us to look for the bear box-we passed a large electrical box about halfway down the trail for emergency floodlights and we were unsure as to whether that was the bear box and we were at our site. It seems stupid now but we're newbies and we were pretty tired! Anyway, a lot of the trail is on top of the sea caves that you see people kayaking through in pictures. It was a gorgeous view-I grew up in Wisconsin and I never thought it was anything but flat cornfields. So we were above the sea caves for a while, the trail turned to dense woodlands for a long time, and just when we were beginning to get frantic we stumbled on the sign marking the campsite, in a clearing right on a stretch of beach. That also marked the first time I touched Lake Superior in my life. Anyway, here is an album with some more pictures from that trip. I also included a few from Jay Cooke State Park near Duluth, MN. We stayed there the previous night and it was breathtaking as well. I tried to limit the selfies and tourist-y pictures for you guys, but it's hard to leave them out!  Edit: I uploaded each picture to the album 4 or 5 times apparently. I'm so bad at the internet. I'll fix it later tonight when I have a minute. Sorry!!"

I had just entered from the south instead of the east, and for some reason didn't connect that it was wrong at first. I know this area very well, so I normally don't need the map, and as such didn't look at it until I knew it was the right valley in order to find out how that was.   Eventually I figured I had followed the wrong trail for about a kilometer, which meant that I ended up on the wrong approach.   Remember kids, even if you know the area, you can get lost."

We hung all food from a bear hang anyways, preferably something that was strung out a very long distance from the tree so the raccoons wouldn't tightrope walk along it. I never had any issues with mice chewing through bags, but after my friend bought a 10-L dry bag from MEC for a canoe trip, we started always hanging our food in that. I feel like that thick, watertight rubbery material would be much harder to chew through than the thin nylon of a stuff sack. Maybe it even blocks the smell a little more? So far, it has worked!  EDIT: the dry bag wasn't super light, but we considered it a necessity for a portage trip so we had it on hand anyways.

CampingandHiking,3cq1tq,Data00Negative,2,Thu Jul 9 21:23:52 2015 UTC,"You can basically do Mesa Verde in a day. You might not see every Ancient Puebloan site, but you can get the gist. There aren't any really long hikes or much backcountry (to protect from relic hunters) so it is mostly going from site to site.  I stayed there for two or three days once, and I saw literally everything.  It was really interesting if you like ancient culture, but if you are on limited time, this may be where you cut some time.    Arches is beautiful and there are lots of cool hikes to the different arches, but you can do this in one night and still see most of the highlights.    I don't know how experienced you are, but Black Canyon backcountry is pretty tough, particularly because of the slope to get down. It is still very pretty from the front country.    My concern with your plan is that you are doing a lot of driving between the parks as well.  You might be aggressive with your plans of seeing so many parks,when you might end up seeing more highway than parks. Something to consider."
CampingandHiking,3cq1tq,rrb,2,Fri Jul 10 05:39:25 2015 UTC,"If you can get to the Needles in Canyonlands, hike to Druid Arch.  We just did a 2 week trip to Bryce Canyon, Arches, and Canyonlands. We hit up both Islands in the Sky and Needles and I think Druid Arch was one of my favorite things.    If you are in Arches, make sure you hike the Primitive Loop trail early on.  It was the most peaceful and beautiful part of this very touristy park."

The Maze is supposed to be great if you have a 4wd vehicle to explore it."

I hear what you are saying rrb on the drive time.  I think the longest drive is from Denver to Sand Dunes to start the trip.  From there they are pretty manageable at a few hours.  And Canyonlands and Arches are less than an hour.    My wife recently set a life goal of hitting all 59 parks before we kick the bucket, so we're using this trip to cross a handful off.  I definitely don't want to overlook anything though just for the sake of crossing something off of a list..."

Canyonlands is really three parks.  Islands is closest to Arches, and is a quick trip but an amazing ""overlook""!  Moab itself is a cool town, and was a good base for us.  Needles is to the southeast, about 2 hours drive from Moab, as I recall.  We really liked the small canyon hiking there.  The Maze is a bunch of large canyons, and it's a few hours drive southwest of Moab, I believe - haven't been there yet."

It is great for the first time because a) it is in an absolutely gorgeous spot, Tuckerman Ravine, and b) it can be very variable in terms of difficulty. It is I believe about 2 miles from the parking lot to the shelter, so your trip can be a total of 4 miles if you decide you really don't want to go very far. But from there you can also summit Mt Washington, Mt Monroe, go up to Lakes of the Clouds Hut and hang out there, hike along the Presidential Ridge to Clay or even Jefferson, do a loop up over Boott Spur and Lion Head, hang out in the bowl of Tuckerman Ravine for a while, etc.   Plus that's one of my favorite spots in the world."

That being said, there are lots of spots where people set up tents right by the trail or right by a river.

CampingandHiking,3cou3n,achancesw,3,Thu Jul 9 16:04:55 2015 UTC,"Mountain House meals are easy to make, but they are also extremely expensive.  You're looking at probably $10 per meal if you go the MH route, which can add up quickly if you plan to backpack a lot.    With a pocket rocket, you can easily simmer, so it gives you a little bit more versatility.  Lipton Pasta and Rice Sides are a fraction of the cost of Mountain House meals (you can often find them on sale for $1 per package), and are easy to cook on a stove that simmers.  I generally bring powdered milk to add to make the sauces creamier (many of the pasta sides call for milk anyways), as well as dehydrated vegetables to add some more texture and fiber to the meals.  Hot sauce is also a good add-in to spice the meals up further.  Make sure you clean dishes well away from any water sources, and also well away from your campsite.  When food particles and soaps get into water bodies, the added nutrients can contribute to increased algae growth which can lead to significant changes in water ecosystems.  Leave No Trace suggests cleaning dishes at least 200 feet from any water bodies, and in many areas it is actually illegal to clean your dishes in water bodies (meaning you can be fined for it if caught).    If you've got significant quantities of food left over, you need to bag it in a ziplock and carry it out (this is why pre-planning your meals is so important, as you'll be less likely to end up packing out left overs).  Standard practice is to use warm or hot water and a tiny little bit of soap.  A scrubby can be useful, but they can get nasty quick in the backcountry.  I generally find that, as long as I haven't burned my meal, my fingers suffice for most of the scrubbing.  A small piece of screening can be useful for filtering out larger food particles (again, bag these in a ziplock and carry them out).  With the gray water, the current best practice is to broadcast it over a wide area by making large sweeping tosses of your pot.  If you're camped in a popular area that gets a lot of use, though, it may be better to dig a sump hole to deposit your gray water in.  Fill the hole in after it drains.    If you want to be really hard core, you can use no soap at all and just drink your gray water.  It is an acquired taste that takes some getting used to, but the advantages are that your impact is even further decreased (and you can be lazy since you don't have to get up and leave camp to do the dishes)."
CampingandHiking,3cou3n,DSettahr,2,Thu Jul 9 17:17:57 2015 UTC,"Mountain house meals only need boiling water. You boil the water, pour it into the bag, zip the top, and wait. There is no clean up because you eat right out of the bag. So really, all you need is some sort of vessel to boil water. If you are only boiling water and don't plan to actually do any cooking you can get away with some sort of titanium pot, However if you want a bit more versatility, I like the GSI halulite stuff, it is ""non stick"" and works well for cooking. The reason I don't like cooking in titanium is because of the way it transfers heat and how things stick on it.  Edit: Words"

CampingandHiking,3cou3n,strickt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:27:37 2015 UTC,"/u/MotoFox got the hot water in a bag method down exactly.  This is why stoves like the Jetboil have become so popular, if all you want to do is make hot water it might as well be efficient.  If you want to be more creative then get a coated pot of some kind, a stove that can simmer, and a plastic scraper.  There's plenty of foods like the Knorr pasta or rice meals that can be cooked on the trail and eaten right out of the pot.  The trick is to use a little more water than what the recipe calls for and to not burn it in the pot-which is why you want a stove with good temperature control.  The pocket rocket is a good choice for that.  Once you've eaten your meal use the scraper to clean out the pot, and yes you eat what you scrape.  It's food.  Once the pot is clean then add a little water to remove the residue.  I also drink this because, once again, it's just food with water.  Final clean up is boiling a small amount of water and sterilizing your scraper and spoon in it.  No dishes to clean using this method.  /edit-Evernew makes coated titanium pots-expensive as hell but worth it in my opinion.  The GSI pots are anodized and coated aluminum and are a good budget alternative."
CampingandHiking,3cou3n,pto892,2,Thu Jul 9 16:57:36 2015 UTC,"I have to say that I dislike freezer bag cooking and avoid it whenever possible-the bag is just impossible to clean (yes, I know that's sort of the point) plus I really can't stand the idea of plastic leaching into my food.  My technique may be a little more work, but at the end of it there's no food waste whatsoever plus less trash to pack out.  I also generally use a pot cozy and place the pot into it after a 2 minute boil, and then let it set for 10 minutes to finish cooking.  This saves fuel too, which is always nice.  Usually my pot ends up clean enough at the end that I don't have to bear bag it.  YMMV of course, so do what works for you."
CampingandHiking,3cou3n,pto892,2,Thu Jul 9 18:33:33 2015 UTC,"No malice here, just agreeing to disagree on the finer points of how to do this.  FWIW I repackage my food into ziplocs too to save weight (a lot of my food is home dehydrated), and reuse them throughout my trip for trash and/or other food items.  To me that seems like making less trash since the bags get reused, but at the you're right that I'm still carrying the same weight as you are so good point.  I also don't use soap to clean my pot, just water and the scraper.  As long as the food isn't burned it comes right out-another reason to use the cozy method to finish cooking the food since it's removed from flame early in the cooking cycle.  I don't even bring a scrubby any more.  Thank you for the polite criticism BTW, it's a refreshing change from the crap that sometimes gets thrown around.  People can disagree and still get along.  Have an upvote!"

CampingandHiking,3cohcn,FullyGrownAdult,3,Thu Jul 9 14:29:01 2015 UTC,Fashion a makeshift rain skirt out of a trash compacter bag. DWR spray's won't work on non waterproof materials for any extended amount of time.

CampingandHiking,3cohcn,freedomweasel,2,Thu Jul 9 15:22:29 2015 UTC,"The advice I would give is to protect yourself in other ways... Gaiters help your legs/shoes. Trail runner ones are small and I wear mine in all conditions, full size ones will really keep the water out. You could have 'rain' clothes - then 'camp', 'sleeping', 'hiking' or whatever clothes. That way you are comfortable when it's not raining - but just go with it when it does rain. I would say a rain jacket is more important than rain pants. Especially with the Prana's - they dry fast.      A rain cape is popular too. It protects you and the pack while hiking and gives you room to be free while in camp. I think Frogg Toggs makes one that is popular.  Or even a rain kilt (which I don't own but I want one).           Waterproof is always a tough call - because being active in clothing that does not breathe is no fun. GoreTex is popular because it is both breathable (kinda) and waterproof. With the waterproof spray - it is not breathable - so it is like a plastic coating on your body - which is why cheap rain jackets suck. For non-active times it's easier to wear cheap rain gear. You aren't exerting energy to generate sweat - so breathability is less of a concern.       What temps do you expect? Above 40F I really don't worry about rain pants. I get too hot and the sweat wets me out as much as the rain would."

The Beta LT and Alpha FL are nice but no pit zips, the Alpha SV and AR are nice too but I'd take the AR as a small weight saving.  If you're not specifically after Arc' the Marmot Speed Light (Gore-tex Pro) is an awesome piece as are the Patagonia Leashless (Gore-tex Active) and Patagonia Triolet (Gore-tex Pro), the Outdoor Research Axiom (Gore-tex Active). All of these will retail between ~$400-500USD If you're happy to branch into eVent or Polartec Neoshell Rab and Montane make some awesome jackets too as do Norrona and Mammut for some more continental EU brands.

Athletic fit, N80p-X GORE-TEX® Pro 3L (and 40p) fabrics are durable, and nice features (pit zips). I also have the Beta LT and although it is lighter - I prefer the increase in durability of the AR (the athletic vs. trim fit is also my preference).       In general - with Arc'teryx and any jacket - you need to look at materials first. Just saying GoreTex is not enough, you need to specifically see what type of GoreTex to understand breathability, durability, feel, etc. Then look at fit. I'm fatter - so trim fit ends up being tight, so I look for roomer cuts. You really can't go wrong with Arc'teryx - but there are subtle differences in their shells and it is important to notice these features/facts."

You seem to know more or less what you are looking for as far as purpose, which is a better start than most haha. It seems you want a packable waterproof breathable shell- insulation would be secondary. For this reason I recommend a Gore-tex with pac light technology. After that, brand doesn't really matter much- focus more on sizing and weight of the individual jackets. I own TNF's Dryzzle jacket and take it on all outdoor trips- love that thing. Pac light tech and runs about $200. Another option that I have experience with is TNF's Mountain Light Triclimate. Go talk to an outdoor rep for an hour and try some items- but make sure the rep has actual experience. We love helping and teaching people who are genuinely interested."

I am more of a canoe tripper in the park, but that involves a lot of portaging.  I would say your route looks fair.  I think on the first day you may have forgotten to account for the 2km from the West gate to the trail head, and maybe the same on the way home.  In my experience you start to feel stronger as you go and 4 hours travel time is not crazy.  I plan trips with 8 hours of travel time so you will be ok.  Take it easy and dont worry too much about how long it takes.  The only worry is darkness and making the bus home.  Day One you have from 1PM to about 8 PM to get to your site if you account for unloading and getting your permit so 7 hours to do 10-12km is plenty.  Day Two if you get up and out by 11 (late) you have lots of time to make it.  Then on day Three you should be moving the fastest because there is no more food to carry.  I would say this is still a rush day as you dont want to miss the bus.    Good Luck in the Park."

CampingandHiking,3cjn23,mvmntsofthemind,2,Wed Jul 8 16:10:13 2015 UTC,"This is your route?  Elevation change is minimal, and the time estimates you provided are generous. What you can do is estimate your hiking time using experience with similar pack weight and terrain. Looks like your route has minimal elevation change. Then you can check on sunrise and sunset times, combined with your drop off and pickup times and estimate how many hours of hiking you have available and how much you want to do. Your first and last days are short so it doesn't matter that you aren't starting until noon. The only ""long"" day (hint: 4.5 hours is not a long a day) is day 2 and you can wake up as early or late as needed.  You will be fine! You will enjoy your trip more if you can lighten your load, but that goes with any kind of trip. I'd be bored on a trip with less than 4 hours of hiking in a 12 hour day.  Have fun!"

CampingandHiking,3cjn23,dolonto,2,Wed Jul 8 16:11:46 2015 UTC,"I have done this loop. If there is any way to change your last night to steep rise lake (the south site) do it. Amazing site. Little hardy can sometimes flood where the thunder box sits.   Your trip is reasonable, distances are definitely achievable. Since neither inf you are regular hikers you will notice the fatigue mostly in your feet. Basically your muscles are used to flat easy ground not dynamic and twisting foot placement. if your feet tingle when your home, don't worry they are just pissed off.   As far as elevation goes, mvmntsofthemind is right not a lot of over all change. but this loop has lots of ups and downs, the last day being the worst of the three on your loop. they are short, about 25m high at most. my suggestion for new people is hike up hard and don't stop until you make it to the top. when you are up don't rest until your heart rate returns to normal. keep moving slowly after the hill. this will make a huge difference in your overall energy levels throughout any hike. (this is for hills under 200m)  Also FYI average hike speed is about 4-5 km for irregular hikers.  Jeffs map is the best, I use it for all my hikes in Algonquin. I spend a lot of time out there so feel free to ask if you have any other questions."
CampingandHiking,3cjn23,dolonto,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:31:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply! I'm not too worried about our feet, we do a lot of nature walking whenever we get the chance and I'm not only on city streets when I walk dogs, I go to High Park which is mostly nature trails. Not as rugged as Algonquin for sure though!   When you say average hiker speed is 4-5 km what do you mean?   I don't think we're going to change from Little Hardy. I would change if everyone agreed we'd taken on too much, and if it was better to book one site for two nights to reduce our hiking, but we think the hiking will be fine. So I don't want to pay the reservation change fee just in case of a flooded thunder box. We'll just deal with it.   I've done Algonquin a few times, one amazing canoe trip in the Barron Canyon and a lot of drive in camping.

CampingandHiking,3cjn23,makederr,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:27:04 2015 UTC,Thanks! I think we'll get that bug spray and also the bug repellent cream. A friend went up recently and said the combo worked the best :)
CampingandHiking,3cjn23,makederr,2,Fri Jul 10 14:36:16 2015 UTC,"I've done first 2 loops on WU - and your route looks reasonable. One potential hiccup that happened to a friend on this trail - his small dog got tired on a 15km hike in relentless rain! The trail does not have a large elevation gain, but it is pretty rugged, and can be a challenge for smaller creatures."
CampingandHiking,3ckcit,mattcooperkay,2,Wed Jul 8 16:13:32 2015 UTC,"2.5 L is great to wear feels much better on your skin and the stretch is a nice touch.   Do not rub against anything ever for any reason. Imagine a stretchy synthetic shirt, it snags and because it stretches and tears. For hiking it is not ideal, unless you are very careful. which is no fun.   Also the 2.5 is an extra cost that pushes you close to a Gore-tex  shell. North face for example The leonidas jacket is a 2.5 L jacket for $200 US. The Dryzzle Jacket is also $200 US and is Gore-tex paclite shell with rip-stop nylon layer... the make non- strechy and comfortable 2.5L jackets but again they are too much money for what you get.   Also the Ran jacket is a far better choice between those two options. Pertex is an amazing technology. It will be the most breathable and most durable of the two and more breathable than Gore-tex.  So if your rough on your gear, hang your head and buy a Gore-tex active shell. If you want to risk it and don't mind a new jacket every 3 years get the Ran.   Good luck out there."
CampingandHiking,3ckcit,gilmoredavid,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:38:03 2015 UTC,"Cheers for your input.  Really unsure what to do still, but your advice is useful! I should probably just deal with it and get a 3 layer, the Rab is just so damn nice feeling. Not a bad price either, can get for £74 on my works discount, as opposed to the £130 standard price..."
CampingandHiking,3ckcit,gilmoredavid,2,Wed Jul 8 20:27:02 2015 UTC,"buy the Rab, it is a great jacket and Pertex is an amazing technology. If you don't mind a new jacket every 3-4 years there is nothing wrong with a jacket that style. Honestly it is about days of hard use that kills jackets. My grandma will get 10 years out of a rain jacket because she isn't slugging a pack or rubbing on trees and rocks. You need to buy a jacket that suits your lifestyle, the Ran will be ultralight and breathable and really nice price with your discount. I would buy it."
CampingandHiking,3ckcit,spotdog14,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:14:36 2015 UTC,"Good information. I've got an old TNF Leonidas jacket and while I LOVE the jacket to death its breaking down after 4 years of use. I had to re-water proof it this past backpacking season and so far its holding up ok, I also had to put some tenacious tape over some parts where the inner liner is delaminating to keep it water proof.   I'm really torn on its replacement. I have not been happy with TNF's replacement policy as of late so I will probably get another brand and probably go full Gore-Tex."
CampingandHiking,3ckcit,gilmoredavid,2,Thu Jul 9 13:41:04 2015 UTC,"Just an FYI the inner liner problem is a poor care issue. It is actually due to a lack on real information being passed to the customer. Basically what happens is your skin oil gets soaked into the inner layer and peels it away from the nylon shell. this is why your jacket is proabably yellow where the peeling is happening too. The way to prevent this is to wash the coat as much as you use it. If you spend a day on the trail sweating that jackets need to be washed just like the t shirt under it. Another thing many people don't know is that washing a jacket is important but more important is drying it, yeah that scary thing. Shells need heat to re-activate the waterproof coating on them to be waterproof. So after you wash it it needs 20 min on low-med heat to dry out and reactivate the coating. The same thing goes for goretex.  Now the TNF issue is not a product problem it is more a delivery issue. They have pushed their products to masses and forgotten to explain how they work and how to care for them. So the customer has a coat that is de-laminating and goes back to TNF and they say welp you didn't care for it. and you say well i didn't know, and they say too bad its on the tag (which it is). the information is there TNF just isn't communicating it very well.   I don't know where your from but get an Arcteryx jacket. They make the best shells out of Gore-tex. Don't fear the price, get a black one and you will get 10 hard years out of it, 20 easy years."

I really like Abrams Falls, but it gets crowded. All of these are located in the Cades Cove area, so you don't have to travel far!

CampingandHiking,3cjqsu,akasnacks,2,Wed Jul 8 18:19:07 2015 UTC,I second Gregory Bald and Rocky Top and Thunderhead the bonus being you go through Spence Field. Another option is Finley Cane to Bote Mtn turn left at the junction and cross the road in about a mile or so and take Schoolhouse Gap to Turkeypen Ridge back to your car for about 8.5 miles total. Another option in the area and one of my favorite places is Indian Flatts Falls. Take Tremont road to the end and hike up Middle Prong Trail. After you start really climbing and doing some switchbacks look to your right and you will see some Cairns. This is an unmarked side trail back to the falls. If you get to the junction with Lynn and Greenbrier you just passed it back track just a little ways and you will see it.

CampingandHiking,3cjj75,TheJerseyDevil123,13,Wed Jul 8 12:08:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not concerned about what you're forgetting, but instead about what you're bringing along.  Way too much redundancy, you're carrying extra gear for no good reason.  You don't need 3 knives, a multitool, and a machete.  You also don't need a head lamp and a maglite with extra batteries for both.  Pick one item each out of the above-one knife, one light.  What is the machete for?  Plus a hand crank radio?  Again, what is this for?  You need to be reasonable as to why you're bringing something, it has to be a need and not a want.  6 bandannas?  Why that may?  Why are there a ""few emergency blankets spread around the pack""?  Take one.    You have both a poncho and goretex rain suit?  Again this is doubling up for no reason-take one or the other but not both.   You don't need three rolls of duct tape, one will do.  The canteen is super heavy and can be easily replaced with a gatorade bottle that weighs one oz and holds 1L of water.  The MMSS is really heavy, but if it's what you've got then be selective about it.  It's early fall in NJ, you don't need the cold weather bag.  The bivy and poncho liner plus clothing will be fine.  Night time temps will probably be in the 50's to 60's.  You're bringing a BSA mess kit, plus a hobo tool, plus a metal plate, bowl, and cup?  Am I getting that right?  You only need a small pot, a cup, and a spoon for a basic mess kit for one.    Set up an account at lighterpack.com, get a food scale and weigh everything and then enter all your listed gear to get an idea of just what you're taking and how the weight plays out.  /edit-the point is that by eliminating redundant gear and concentrating on the essentials you can then have room for carrying items like a camp chair, or more food, or some other luxury type item.  You said you don't mind carrying extra weight but then you spend that on carrying double and triple items that you only need one of."

CampingandHiking,3cjj75,peniscurve,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:43:54 2015 UTC,"I only recommend lighterpack because it's what I'm familiar with.  It's just a way to organize gear and track weight, so anything will work.  Cutting weight is largely experience, but on reddit go check out /r/ultralight."

CampingandHiking,3cjj75,peniscurve,0,Wed Jul 8 15:45:12 2015 UTC,I've decided the machete is out the multitool and maglight are always with me the batteries are more of a better to have and not need than to need and not have. The radio is a 4 in 1 combo 6 bandanas because I always seem to loose them. Poncho and rain suit because poncho is easier and the gortex can get really hot after wearing for a bit it doesn't breath very well. The duct tape are tiny rolls like what you would put in a desk top tape dispenser but you're right 1 will be fine. The canteen isn't that heavy and it's a back up incase my bladder pops and probably wont get used. Yes the MMS is heavy as hell but I hate the cold and again you're right I could get away with just the green bag and poncho liner shouldn't need the bivy with a tent. After looking at what I'm probably going to be doing for food I'm leaving out the metal plate bowl and cup. Thanks for the input.  edit The emergency blankets are spread in the sense that I have one in the lid of my pack and one in my first aid kit
CampingandHiking,3cjj75,peterd08,6,Wed Jul 8 14:28:08 2015 UTC,"Holy smokes, that's a lot of stuff.    Things I would exclude right off the bat:   Bring about 100 feet of your preferred cord (you could get away with 50, too) Canteen - no need when you have both a nalgene and bladder.  Looks like there's pretty consistent water on that trail. Poncho or rain suit, not both. First Aid kit - do you really need a splint?  If you're bringing some duct tape, you could grab some wood to make a splint. If you're set on the hand crank radio, skip the extra batteries for your headlamp and put fresh ones in before you go.  If you know the battery won't last the time you'll be on the trail, bring just enough extra.  Personally, I'd skip the radio, though. 6 bandanas?  Why? No extra duct tape is required, especially not 3 rolls.  Bring what's on your Nalgene only. What are you cooking on your trip?  Do you really need all sorts of serving ware?  Bring something flexible.  If you can eat out of it and cook in it, even better.  Hobo tool is good. Machete, 7"" knife and 3"" knife and a mulitool?  Bring the multitool.  Maybe bring one other if you must.  Ditch the others unless you're planning on bushwhacking.  If you can't break the stick for a fire, it's too big.  No maglite if you have a headlamp   Things you don't have that I'd include:   Socks, clothes - bring a couple extra pairs of socks and underwear and an extra shirt. Toothbrush, etc? Sunscreen and bug spray Down coat/fleece Rain cover/trash bag for your pack For that matter, you haven't listed your pack :) In your first aid kit - Tylenol, Benadryl, Tumms, Moleskin, etc.   Either way, 100 miles is quite a ways, do you have backpacking experience?  I would absolutely do a practice overnight with your planned gear first.  You are going to wind up moving at about 14 miles a day given your pace, which is quite quick.  Evan an 8 mile day is enough to make your feet and knees hurt like hell if you're not prepared."
CampingandHiking,3cjj75,peterd08,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:37:36 2015 UTC,"The things I didn't include like the clothes, a jacket, hygiene kit, bug spray are all included but forgot to put them on the list. The extra duct tape are tiny little rolls like the the size you would put in your desk top tape dispenser but you're right I could probably cut that down to one. The hand crank radio is a 4 in 1 combo. 6 bandanas because they weigh next to nothing and I always seem to loose them. The canteen is just a back up incase the bladder pops (I've had it happen before) and it probably wont get used. I'm doing both the poncho and rain suit because I really hate being wet so if nature calls middle of the night I can just quick throw the poncho on also if it starts raining while i'm walking it's easier to just grab the poncho (I will be look at weather before I go but it aint always right). The sam splint is small, light weight, and moldable so I think it's better than a few sticks. Haven't really decided on food yet but probably going to do some home made mre's for breakfast things like cliff bars and things of that sort that I can just snack on for lunch and dinner is where I'm running into the problem. I probably will leave out the metal plate bowl and cup now that I'm thinking about what I'll be having food wise. The mag light is because it's just part of my edc and I never leave home with out it same thing with the multi tool I'm gonna loose the machete because the bigger knife would be fine for anything i'd need the machete for. The bank line is something that always sits at the bottom of my pack and I'm probably wrong on the length I spooled it on an old fishing line spool but it never leaves the pack. I don't have experience with actual backpacking but I do have experience with military forced marching humping or what ever you want to call it I did it for 4 years. My pack is a USMC ILBE pack and yes I do have a pack cover for it. I think I hit all your points thanks for the advice  edit Also the gortex rain suit can get pretty damn hot. Also I plan to do a few 5 mile hikes in the months leading up to it so I can adjust things accordingly"
CampingandHiking,3cjj75,Almostcomatose,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:16:03 2015 UTC,"Bandanas - I would still cut that down to like 3.  Losing stuff in the backcountry isn't very LNT, but I understand it does happen.  If you're worried about the bladder popping, I'd bring an extra bladder.  Way lighter, and it takes up next to no space.  And cheap (like $12)! If you want to bring both a poncho and rain suit, I'd recommend one of the cheap dollar store ones instead of a heavier plastic one if that's what you're planning to take.  It will save you at least a half a pound. I'm okay with the splint, but be cautious about overpacking your first aid kit.  Don't bring things that you don't know how to use (for example, stuff for stitches if you're not trained on how to do it). Ditching the metal stuff for cooking sounds good.  There's no need for 3 light sources.  Get rid of the crank radio if you must bring the mag light - it weighs 10.4 oz.  You can signal with a whistle or your headlamp. So you'll have a multitool and a 7"" knife?  As long as you're not also bringing the 3"", that's much more reasonable.   Even with military experience, I highly highly highly suggest doing an overnight (hey, even the first 8-10 miles of the trail you're planning on fully doing since it's so close to home!) before September.  You've got lots of time!"
CampingandHiking,3cjj75,Xenro,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:31:19 2015 UTC,"The extra bladder idea is a good one I'm probably gonna do that. The poncho is a military one a bit heavier but so much more durable The first aid kit is like I said a basic one with changes made it started as a pre made store bought and I added some gauze pads, better bandaids a small bottle of iodine (like pill bottle size) I'm going to go to my doctor like a week before leaving and ask for a few percosets as a just in case I get a serious injury but I do have Tylenol and Motrin in there also and a cat tourniquet though I really hope I will have no need for it"
CampingandHiking,3cjj75,peniscurve,3,Wed Jul 8 14:50:24 2015 UTC,"You military folk always have the funniest idea of what needs to be brought on a leisurely hike. Good lord, whats your pack weigh? 100lbs?   A few emergency blankets? A few?! How many emergencies do you plan on being in? A poncho and a goretex rainsuit?! and a poncho liner? A canteen and a nalgene bottle and a bladder? A filter and tabs? 3 knives, a multi tool and a hobo tool!? hahaha this just keeps going! Hot glue sticks lol. That's a first. Six?! six cotton bandanas? Why six? Why cant you dip one in a stream and re wear it? A hand crank flashlight? You already have a mag lite (which is a terrible choice as it is) AND a headlamp?? You have 3 lights?? 300 feet of assorted rope? Are you planning to hang your food from an airplane or something?   The military loads your pack up all ridiculous like this on purpose to make life hell. If you bring all this ridiculous stuff on the trail, you will regret it."

You can find contact information on the MNF website:  http://www.fs.usda.gov/mnf/  It might be worth investing in a tent that doesn't need pitching in the bed of your truck if you camp often- it gives you a lot more flexibility about where and how you can set up camp."

CampingandHiking,3chl89,sniperfart,2,Wed Jul 8 00:12:24 2015 UTC,"This comes up every now and then. Seems like staying warm is at the top of everyone's list. You really can't escape the heat, but you can make it more tolerable.   Toss the tent and get a hammock. The convective heat loss that freezes occupants in mildly cool weather is an asset when it's warm or hot. Site selection. In the winter your sop posed to avoid valleys and the tops of hills because of the cold air collecting in valleys, and windy hill tops. Well, when it's really hot at night, there is no cool air, so bank on catching any breeze you can. Camp on top of a hill or on the windward side. Hammocks open up more options for camp sites. Plan for a long period of time between eating and going to sleep. When your body is digesting food it's creating body heat.  If the humidity is high, and it's super hot, a cotton/polly blend shirt will keep you cooler than a full synthetic shirt. Nothin is going to dry out in the conditions we have in the south east. A blended shirt will breathe better, and being wet will keep you cooler. I recently started hiking in tank tops and love it."

I use an O2Cool Tent Fan This will run off the included D-battery pack, or if you have a 1A 12v adapter you can plug it in if you have power. I found some old adapters in the house that worked fine. For summer camp I use an old truck battery to run the fan. I find that having a solid breeze over your face and upper torso makes it much more tolerable. I also use my motorcycle battery for shorter trips - It generally has enough juice to power two fans for 3 nights.  I also use a cot so I can benefit from the convective heat loss and airflow below the cot.  This summer I built a portable cooler AC unit for fun. 5-day rolling cooler with an old heater core from a prior truck I used to have. Plumbed in a bilge pump and I can cycle cold water through the core, which works as a heat exchanger. Bough an inline exhaust fan for a boat and it pulls air through the exchanger just like an AC. Load it up with ice and enough water to cycle the pump, and I get nice cool air at night. Works best with a small tent that has a full coverage fly to help contain the cold."

That being said, in my years of hiking and camping I have never once come across the veritable field of stone stacking that the image in the article shows.  In fact, rarely have I come across more than 1 or 2 stacks on any given hike or camping trip.  This may, of course, be just the places that I have hiked and be the exception, not the rule.    If moving 3 or 4 rocks from the same location into a stack causes some sort of disruption to the environment, then my response would be that we, as moving disruptors, should not be hiking or camping there at all.

They're used primarily in places with few trees and fragile soils, so neither vertical nor horizontal (that is, ground paint) blazes can be used.

CampingandHiking,3ci2n2,cwcoleman,2,Wed Jul 8 18:12:04 2015 UTC,Not crazy. 15C is right on the verge where I would consider wearing goretex pants.       Below 10C and I will wear waterproof pants. Above that temp and I normally sweat too much to make them effective. I get as wet with sweat as I would with rain. So it partially depends on how much you sweat.      What type of pants exactly are they? Do they vent in any way? Although they are shell's only - they still provide warmth - because even goretex doesn't vent like non-waterproof materials.      It may be worthwhile to bring them in your pack and only use them if necessary. On top of those Scotland mountains it get's cold. If you stop on top for lunch - maybe you need them for that part only.        I wear leggings under my rain pants normally. That's because mine are shells only and have big size zippers for venting. The wool/synthetic leggings help grab some moisture and keep my legs happy. I have super thin ones for warmer days and thicker ones for cold days. I could also take off the rain pants and throw on shorts over the leggings if needed. You could try it with only shorts too.
CampingandHiking,3ci2n2,cwcoleman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:08:12 2015 UTC,They're the Burton AK link - 2layer goretex shell. They have vents with zippers.  Current forecasts for the weekend says 8-12 C (46-54F) with brief but intensive rain in the afternoon.  Bit of off topic but what do you think about merino leggings/base layers? Worth the hype?
CampingandHiking,3ci2n2,bloodyclueless,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:08:12 2015 UTC,"Vents are good. Only concern I would have is that the zippers on the pants are only 'water resistant' - so watch out if there truly is a downpour to keep those parts dry. I wish the technical details talked more about the fabric. GoreTex makes many different kinds of fabric. Some more durable / breathable / waterproof than others. Plus they combine it with 'dryride' fabric - so I can't even say want percent of the pant is GoreTex. Anyway -I'm sure it's fine, I would just feel more comfortable taking them out in non-snow conditions knowing they would hold up to a rain storm. For example - I hike in these Arc'teryx Beta AR pants in the conditions you detail - and they are bombproof.       YES - merino leggings are the best. I have 3 pair of different weights and they are all amazing. I wear them many times before washing and they are light + warm. I use my cheaper synthetic ones for warmer days - but my merino wool ones are my favorites. I have boot cut ones for ski season."

A place where I am not normally present. Taking my other experience with me, especially something so much in my head as music, blocks being fully in the place I have made an effort to visit.  Instead it will be that place I saw with a soundtrack rather than the place I saw and heard the wind, the long echos of thunder, the rustle of the plants in the wind, the scurry of the lizard as it seeks shelter, the call of the bird, etc.  I am not opposed to music when camping.

CampingandHiking,3cc5rp,neilson241,2,Tue Jul 7 00:44:59 2015 UTC,"That is how I am. Hike Your Own Hike, relax, enjoy the scenes around you, and be happy that you are one of (# of people with you) that are seeing this exact moment, in this empty wilderness. The only place I want music, is when you are at the campsite, and the group is ok with it.  Just some simple bluegrass or something.  Nothing to destroy the serenity, just something to be in the background as you whittle the time away."

But every once in a while if I'm alone on a hike, Ill throw on something on low volume and just walk, It doesn't take me to the place where I first heard that song, but just gives me a new place to go when I listen to that song on a shitty day. I can think of how relaxing it was and not that  I got screamed at for no reason."
CampingandHiking,3cc5rp,JCMoxie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:43:33 2015 UTC,"What you indicate is why I said I was not opposed to it totally. I too use it sometimes for guided visualization (relaxation) and having an aural and visual connection can help. But typically I am sitting and gazing at a scene and then bring the music in to use for awhile so the sounds, smells of the place along with the visuals and the music can be melded in my mind."

CampingandHiking,3cc5rp,tonedizz,4,Tue Jul 7 01:42:16 2015 UTC,To each his own. Music takes on a whole new meaning when walking through nature. Give it a try sometime.  But I agree to an extent. Maybe about 60% of the time I just take in the sound of nature
CampingandHiking,3cc5rp,wehaveatrex3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:16:16 2015 UTC,I get that but I would never do it on a first pass or perhaps even on a 5th pass through an area. In time I might if it was a regular path I took - as I mentioned earlier I will some times add music to remembrances for later use.   I am not against tech - I work in the tech field and in radio - but I find many I interact with have developed a need to augment their natural experiences because of their use of tech so much elsewhere in their lives. Real sometimes seems to be not enough because we are exposed to so much in the way of produced experiences. So I try to ensure I am able to generally enjoy and experience just what's there to help balance against the other augmented experiences.

I couldn't care less what other people do, but for me I won't even wear buds when I walk through downtown where I've been hundreds of times.  Every day I see/hear/smell something and have come to learn that paying attention to where I am rewards me way more than most music does - and I love music. But, if someone else is happy chilling with some tunes, that's cool."

But I do get annoyed when I see people walking with both ears in because they are cutting themselves from their surroundings. I consider it poor form in terms of responsibility because you might miss somebody calling for help, distant thunder of a building storm, or a faster hiker/biker coming up behind you.   edit: on the subject of music while you hike (irresponsible or responsible), I think ""hike your hike"" applies. Some go out for nature immersion, others focus on destination and listen to music like they would in the car to pass the travel time. Just be considerate, responsible, and do yo thang."

Park and seeing someone sitting beside the trail near a mountain stream.  Made me wonder why they wouldn't pick nature over the iPod.  I think the thing that bothers me more is having ear buds in when you are interacting with someone else.

For a size comp with kit lenses see here.   Not many of them are weather sealed but here are a few picks (it has been a while since I took a close look at the m43 camera, so take the following advise with a grain of salt!):  Olympus OMD E-M10 (~$600 with kit lens)  Olympus OMD E-M5 Mark I (This is an older body now, but it is weather sealed when used with certain (expensive) lenses) ($480 body only, can be hard to find now, replaced by E-M5 Mark II which is twice as expensive)  Panasonic GX7 ($450 with kit lens)  Panasonic GM5 (Tiny camera, but at the expense of fewer manual controls) ($690 with kit lens)   Panasonic GM1 (Older version of GM5) ($450 with kit lens)   My picks would be the EM10 or the GX7, cant go wrong with either of those,  As for lenses, I think the Panasonic 14mm (wide angle) and 20mm (""normal"") are very good prime lenses and are very compact.  The Panasonic 45-150mm or 45-200mm and Olympus 40-150mm a decent cheap telephotos.   I don't know the Olympus lenses as well as the Panasonic ones.  Happy shooting!"

CampingandHiking,3cf6j9,nonphysical,2,Tue Jul 7 16:39:57 2015 UTC,"If you are looking to do a section hike, I think you would be hard pressed to beat doing the Great Smoky National Park section of the AT. One of the most picturesque sections. Only challenge is reserving a spot in the shelters on the AT that are often the only (convenient) place to camp near the trail.   You can easily arrange a shuttle service for a relatively modest price that will take you from the car to start. Start at the Northern end and head south, or you could do the reverse. You could also do half of the AT in GSMNP by starting/ending your hike at Newfound Gap.  As far as your friend, Overweight + Smoker + (Little Backpacking Experience?) + Elevation = Western Mountains No Bueno. If he comes, I would definitely head east.  If you head out solo, the West offers some of the best opportunities. Utah may be a bit too hot in August, but CO would be perfect. San Juan mountains in the SW part of CO are particularly beautiful."

CampingandHiking,3cc2sq,fyeah11,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:47:09 2015 UTC,"It's about 120 miles North East of Phoenix. It's just north of Payson.  The rim itself is basically just a long steep slope that is part of the southern border of the Colorado Plateau. So basically you have a sharp drop that looks out over the rest of the Coconino Nation Forest. Beautiful views.  As for what formed it, I had no idea, so I looked it up. If you believe the internet, then it was formed by uniform erosion back from a monocline that formed over a fault.  Lots of car camping, day hikes, forest roads, mountain biking trails, horseback riding, and of course backpacking. Pretty much a little of everything.  If you are interested in backpacking it, I suggest the Cabin Loop Trail. It's five interconnected trails, two of which follow the edge of the rim. They're good for a day hike but my wife an I like to pick one or two and take our time and find a nice spring to lay up in for a night.   My wife and I have probably backpacked each trail twice and we've only ever seen other people on two occasions, so it's nice and secluded. Granted with our schedules we're usually off during the week and not on weekends so that may play into it."

This is just a guess, but I think altitude sickness might be even worse for an individual who is out of shape, since their baseline breathing capability is lower?  I don't think you are necessarily putting your friend at risk, but they might not make it to the top. It probably also depends on the approach to the 14er.   Good luck, and have fun!"

CampingandHiking,3ccyq2,pypuja,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:08:34 2015 UTC,"thanks! we left our cars at lodgepole visitors center. that's where the trailhead is. Its a technically easy hike, but its definitely uphill. I'm not in the greatest shape but I was fine. I think if you have decent cardiovascular strength to keep going, you'll be fine! For me it was harder to go downhill, and for my friend it was harder to go uphill. it just depends on your body. I think anyone can do this hike, unless you are seriously overweight or not use to having your heart rate up for an extended period of time. Also have to factor in that its at elevation."

CampingandHiking,3cfr5n,slowtreme,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:07:01 2015 UTC,"Citrus tract is my thing right now. I like long hikes (~15 miles a day) with loops that I can camp for a night. It's got these nice rolling hills. It's not much of an elevation thing but it breaks up the monotony of walking flat Florida terrain. There are some caves to explore as well. Downsides are lack of water, sand spurs and ticks.  I hiked almost all of Myakka's trails one weekend and TBH it's not a place I'll revisit. most of the trails have no cover from the sun, so it's a lot of hot sweaty walking.  I haven't made it to green swamp because I don't know of a loop, I didn't want to backtrack."

It doesn't seem to be particularly well made, but like the other Adventuridge products I have owned, I imagine it will last a few camping seasons, and at a third to a fifth of the price of the ""cheap"" packs I was looking at, that's alright with me."
CampingandHiking,3cbmg4,anisaerah,3,Mon Jul 6 17:46:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah there's definitely a market for it. If you're into backpacking and can afford it then it is worthwhile to watch for sales (REI used gear sales are amazing) and grab a reputable pack. But I have plenty of friends who might only use there pack a few times, so as long as it won't break in that time span then it is definitely worthwhile to grab this for $30. Or maybe you're not sure either way if it'll be a long time hobby. Again, this would make complete sense and could save you $250 for a pack sitting in a closet"
CampingandHiking,3cbmg4,nept_r,2,Mon Jul 6 20:11:02 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure this will be a long time hobby, but this will definitely make do for a few trips this summer and fall (and maybe next spring, summer fall) until I can afford the pack that fits me well and I like the most."

CampingandHiking,3cbmg4,howmanydads,2,Tue Jul 7 04:20:12 2015 UTC,Larger volume is also helpful for short trips when one can't afford to update all their gear from car camping stuff to gear more appropriate for hiking.

CampingandHiking,3cbmg4,anisaerah,2,Wed Jul 8 13:28:46 2015 UTC,Very true. I had trouble packing my 55L for longer trips until I switched from a foam pad and super-bulky sleeping bag to an inflatable pad and a better bag that packs quite small.

CampingandHiking,3cbm3a,NoTurnUnstoned,3,Mon Jul 6 21:41:12 2015 UTC,"Cool, 5 days will give you plenty of options.  Some cool trips include the Seven Lakes Basin and High Divide loops, which will be nice and challenging hikes with some good elevation gain and epic views of mountains in the park.  The Hoh River trail, as mentioned previously is also great. It's a long flat river walk with camps every couple miles. Eventually that trail will take you up to the Blue Glacier of Mt. Olympus, this is the main route that folks use to summit Olympus.  The park also has camps and trails near the ocean. I haven't spent much time there myself, but it's certainly beautiful and worth looking into if you want to see the beaches.  On the east side of the Olympics and outside of the park (mostly), there are lots of cool river valley trails that are great fun to explore (and fish if you're into it). I recommend Gray Wolf, Dungeness, Dosewallips and Duckabush River trails.  You can also head up the Big Quilcene River trail to Marmot Pass, and although very popular in the summer, is very pretty and offers tons of camping.  Google the places that sound interesting to you and then determine if they are inside or outside the National Park.  Here are two websites that will be extremely valuable in keeping your trip on the up and up and properly registered and accounted for and bla bla bla.  Olympic National Park  Olympic National Forest  Enjoy your time there and post pics when you get back!"

A great read of a real-life hermit who secluded himself in the backwoods of Maine for 27 years, never interacting with anyone but relying upon the pilfered items found within seasonal cabins and camps.  A very interesting perspective and a must-read.   ""What I miss most,"" he eventually continued, ""is somewhere between quiet and solitude. What I miss most is stillness."" He said he’d watched for years as a shelf mushroom grew on the trunk of a Douglas fir in his camp. I’d noticed the mushroom when I visited—it was enormous—and he asked me with evident concern if anyone had knocked it down. I assured him it was still there. In the height of summer, he said, he’d sometimes sneak down to the lake at night. ""I’d stretch out in the water, float on my back, and look at the stars.""      At the very end of each of our visits, I’d always asked him the same question. An essential question: Why did he disappear? He never had a satisfying answer. ""I don’t have a reason."" ""I can’t explain why."" ""Give me more time to think about it."" ""It’s a mystery to me, too."" Then he became annoyed: ""Why? That question bores me."" But during our final visit, he was more reflective. Isn’t everybody, he said, seeking the same thing in life? Aren’t we all looking for contentment? He was never happy in his youth—not in high school, not with a job, not being around other people. Then he discovered his camp in the woods. ""I found a place where I was content,"" he said. His own perfect spot. The only place in the world he felt at peace."

It might get a little chilly, but we also had days in the 90s.  If you're hiking make sure you take bear spray with you and talk loudly while hiking, occasionally clapping or yelling ""hey bear"".  I spent 9 days there with the lady and we saw three bears, all from large distances and the only grizzly we saw sprinted away as soon as I opened my mouth.  They aren't ""predators"" in that they see you as food, but they are scared of humans or at worst, indifferent.  The issues with bear encounters are when you get too close and encroach on their private space or you startle them.  If you're loud while hiking you won't startle them.  Glacier is easily top 3 places I've ever been, possibly sitting at #1.  It is the only place that is currently on my mind to go back to of all of the places that I have visited.  It is unbelievable, even if you just drive the Going-to-the-Sun road.  Go there, you won't be disappointed.

I don't remember the exact number, but enter the campground, stay to the far right, go to the end, there's a campsite before the road turns to the left. It has a tiny stream running next to it and a private recessed nook in the trees/bushes to pitch a tent. 10am is probably a good time, it's all first-come first-serve.

In other words, you'll be on an established trail the entire way. Is that correct? Assuming it is:  It's absolutely safe. I don't know about spending the night up there, something which I understand is banned but which some people do anyway. I assume that might be dangerous if bad weather came in.  But you can easily camp at Guitar Lake, and around midnight or whatever matches your pace, start hiking. The trail is easy to follow, you'll hardly even need a headlamp if you have a good moon, and the nighttime scenery can be pretty spectacular on the hike up."
CampingandHiking,3c9ksy,Acies,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:48:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, we're looking at camping at Guitar Lake and then trying to reach the summit for sunrise.  I wanted to ask since I know the hike is popular, but a lot of the photos make the trail look a little thin / hard to follow in the dark, although it might just be the angle of the pictures.   Have you done the hike, or are you just saying it looks safe from research?"
CampingandHiking,3c9ksy,Acies,2,Mon Jul 6 15:27:33 2015 UTC,"I did the hike at the end of the JMT, about 5 years ago.  I remember that from Guitar Lake you can see the trail almost all the way up to Trail Crest, and I don't remember have any difficulty following it in the dark. I do think I had a lot of moonlight though, if I remember I didn't even have my headlight on for a lot of it.  The other thing I recall is that as you said, the trail is really popular. So you'll have a whole trail of hikers in front of and behind you, and you'll see the outline of the trail up the mountain from their headlamps as well.  The worst case scenario I imagine is that you could miss a switchback and have to backtrack a bit. But the side of the mountain where you're climbing wasn't terribly steep, so it isn't like you'll fall off a cliff if you lose the trail for a moment or something. And since there is no vegetation anywhere, it's easy to orient yourself on the mountain and find your way back to the trail.  Once you pass Trail Crest, it does get steep on the sides for the last 2ish miles, because you're following a very narrow ridgeline for a while. But because it's so narrow, there isn't any difficulty following the trail there either."

There are some car camping sites there which are relatively nice. Depending on when you go, you can see a large group of Manatees. All year round there are some huge gar that like to swim around.  Hontoon Island State Park is my preferred weekend camping spot - only accessible by a short ferry ride - and has some fun walks to go on. I like kayaking here quite a bit.  Rainbow Springs is a gorgeous place also! More of the same, camping, kayaking and swimming in the springs. Of the three, this is the prettiest one IMO.  There are a few more, but those are the three that came to mind first. Also, watch out for fire ants! They are everywhere."

So there is always that option.    I've used this to my advantage myself on long car trips in the past where I was forced to break up the driving over several consecutive days.  Free camping beats paying for a hotel room most nights."

(Just make sure you bring some vaseline/whatever to rub in the small area between their hind legs and their torso.  The water can mix with sand, rub as they hike and cause some nasty rashing.)  Stop for rest in the shade, give them water more often than you need it.  I tend to give my ACD a handful of water every chance I get when its 90+ out.  I will usually stick to hikes where there are natural springs/lakes/etc for him to use in the dead of summer.  As for the cold... just bring something to insulate them from the ground and they will be fine.  Mine likes to sleep right at my feet, which I welcome."

You fill out a form with your trip plan and vehicle info and drop it in a lock box for the ranger.  I think most of the backpacking trails in Wayne NF have similar arrangements.

I am 6' and around 200 lbs and was reasonably comfortable in this tent. I made a footprint for this tent from plastic painters drop cloth to protect it from the rough soil/vegetation in the burnt out white mountain region of northern arizona.  What I liked about the tent... Very easy to set up/take down The zip open top made for easier entry/exit instead of having to inchworm in If not worried about rain the roll up fly is nice  What I didn't like...

Like I said earlier I've been happy with eureka, and have gone back 3 more times, I think their products are well made at their price point.   I can't guarantee it but it seems to me in my experience the average user who is satisfied with their product is much less likely to leave a review than the person who is bitter theirs broke.

The downsides are: you cant sit up in the tent, no gear vestibule, it doesn't vent well if you have the rainfly closed. Also after dragging dirt/or rain across my bag a few times I really wanted a side entrance.  I switched to a Spitfire. It solved all my concerns and only cost about $20 more on amazon if you watch for the price drops. It's so much faster to setup as well.  Also just do yourself a favor and order different tent spikes. the ones they come with bend easily and are heavy. If you go with the Spitfire you only need 4, any 6 pack of Ti spikes/stakes will be all you ever need."

Doing it in a single day would have been a lot less fun, and is not recommended by the park.  I think trying to do it twice in three days is a very bad idea, especially if you wouldn't have considered doing half dome again that quickly and you're not regular hikers. Perhaps you'd be physically capable of doing it, but I think it would be absolutely miserable. And if you don't enjoy it, why do it? Personally I would have much preferred a long shuttle ride to having to do it again immediately, and we were able to rest at the bottom.  That's the other thing to consider: Phantom Ranch is a cool place to take in. My sister and I wished we could have gotten a permit for two nights so we could have spent a full day there. If you try to do it all in our day, you won't be able to stick around for very long. I understand the desire to do this soon, but remember why you want to do it first and foremost, and ask yourself if this plan is worth it. Also keep calling. We got our site only a few months in advance due to a cancellation."
CampingandHiking,3c3n9f,NoodleDrive,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:16:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!  If we can get a canceled room at Phantom Ranch should we do it, or should we wait until May (I hear that's a better time to go weather wise) and get a room at Phantom Ranch for the evening.

CampingandHiking,3c3n9f,NoodleDrive,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:49:46 2015 UTC,Personally I would wait until May if that's an option. I went in June and it was 130 degrees at the base (109 in the shade). Plus you won't have to deal with as many families near the rim.
CampingandHiking,3c3n9f,sktyrhrtout,2,Mon Jul 6 17:59:59 2015 UTC,"Not to be mean, but there is no way a casual hiker is going to do 23 miles in one day with a 1 mile altitude change. It's a very strenuous hike, especially if it's going to be hot. I've done it before and I'm an avid hiker and I would HIGHLY recommend taking 3 days to go either direction.   I set out with the same plan as you to go there and back again, but once I got across I had no interest in hiking back again so I hitchhiked back.   It's a serious hike and you'll see tons of signs letting you know that people get rescued all the time, and it's most often young people that think they're fit."
CampingandHiking,3c3n9f,sktyrhrtout,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:26:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!  I'm leaning more on the I'll go one way, but I doubt I'd want to go back the next day!

CampingandHiking,3c3n9f,MaybeImNaked,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:55:01 2015 UTC,"You definitely need to sleep somewhere on this hike. I think you'll need 2 nights 3 days at the VERY minimum! Remember you'll have to pack in all meals and sometimes water isn't available at certain spots. I suggest you get a 10-15 mile hike with a decent elevation change under your belt. The hardest part about this hike will be when you get to the other side of the river. The elevation will begin to climb and it's a solid 10 miles of heavy steep climbing.  It can be done, but prepare yourselves. Don't be a statistic and don't think you'll handle it without any training."
CampingandHiking,3c3n9f,SgtSausage,2,Mon Jul 6 14:25:14 2015 UTC,"I've done a lot of the popular day hikes in the southwest, so I can give you my comparison.  The hardest day hike for me was Mt. Whitney (I would totally recommend it btw especially if you can camp halfway through, super beautiful hike). Probably second hardest was the grand canyon hike (but just south rim to river and back to south rim).  I was miserable on that hike. The super hot weather at the bottom was draining. I recommend it still, but do plan on ways to keep cool if it's 100 degrees (dip hat in water every once in a while, etc).  From what I hear, the climb up to the north side is harder than the climb up to the south side.  Half dome is one of the easier day hikes, in my opinion.  You can totally do your plan, but carrying all the gear you would need for it sounds insane. Just one rim to rim hike is incredibly draining.  Google rim to rim to rim to get people's experiences to see if you're really ready for it. I think your best alternate plan is to just do a rim to rim hike (going back to the same rim you started from)."
CampingandHiking,3c3n9f,paleolithic,2,Sat Jul 4 14:33:03 2015 UTC,"Take THREE days (one way)and enjoy the ride.  I know too many folks who ruined an otherwise enjoyable experience by doing it in a day.   My favorite is start North and come South. N. Kaibob to Cottonwood. Camp the night.   Longer second day from Cottonwood, to Colorado river, back up to Indian Gardens (Bright Angel Trail). Camp the night.  Third day - short, easy peasy, Indian Garden to South Rim. Take the side trip out onto Tonto and the overlook (Plateau Point?) if you've got time and energy - mega cool view.  That's three days - one way, right? Don't even try to make it AND go back in two hiking days. If you're not already an experienced Big Mile hiker, you'll never make it.  We're decades experienced, and still wouldn't do it 'cause: no fun, right? Do-able? Sure but definitely no fun. No fun at all so why bother?"
CampingandHiking,3c3n9f,panafoot,2,Sat Jul 4 15:22:05 2015 UTC,"Absolutely no fun.  This is a hike you want to be fun because of how incredible it is, so do it right."
CampingandHiking,3c3n9f,panafoot,2,Sat Jul 4 21:02:55 2015 UTC,"I have done rim to rim as well as Half Dome and don't think they are comparable.  We have done extensive hiking and backpacking in Grand Canyon National Park but would not consider doing what you are wanting to do in August-September.  One should never underestimate the dangers of the combination of distance, elevation loss and gain, altitude and heat.  Being young, healthy and ""active"" will take you only so far and heat stroke is no joke. If you still want to attempt rim to rim in one day then start down from the North Rim as early as possible.  Carry extra water to soak your shirts and heads regularly and wear broad brimmed hats.  Eat salty snacks and take electrolyte capsules because you will sweat a lot and hyonatremia is a dangerous condition.  Rest in any shade you encounter.  Plan to take a long break at Indian Garden and be prepared to hike up the rest of the way in the dark so take headlamps.  Then plan to take the shuttle back to the North Rim.     There are several different signs warning about the dangers including one about the 24 year old Boston Marathoner who died of heat stroke in the canyon but this one is our favorite.  If you can't mark this off of your bucket list now then take heart.  If you stay healthy and active there is life after retirement.  My husband and I have completed many of the trips on our bucket list in the past five years since we retired and started traveling fulltime.  Good luck!"

Very informative - I especially like all the extensive linking for more information and the organization of it all.  I'll be sure to look back to your favorites list when I'm planning trips.  Are there any hikes you guys haven't done but are really hoping to?
CampingandHiking,3c3n9f,mrjowee,2,Tue Jul 7 03:08:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your kind words, it means a lot to me.  Yes, there are many hikes we still want to do.  Probably more than we have the physical ability to do but we figure everything we do from now on is ""icing on the cake"".  We once had the dream of doing the Pacific Crest Trail but decided we needed to be realistic about what my knees could handle so we ""settled"" for the John Muir Trail.  We want to do the Wonderland Trail around Mt Rainier.  My husband has run around it and I have been on parts but I want to do the whole thing.  We actually started it 2 years ago but I fell and broke my wrist on the first night - a major disappointment and it ruined a lot of plans.  There are several trails we want to do in Washington State and may spend next summer there (depending on fire situation).  We want to spend more time in the Sierras but looks like this will be a bad year for fires so we are spending this summer in Colorado (climbing ""14er"" and planning some backpack trips on Continental Divide Trail.  We are also seriously considering doing The Chomolhari Trek in Bhutan.  I guess one's bucket list is never completely done but isn't it a good thing to always have something to strive for and look forward to?"
CampingandHiking,3c3n9f,paleolithic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:02:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know what kind of reservations the shuttles require, but it sounds like you could decide on your rest day whether to do the return trip by foot or by bus. Having that contingency makes this a more reasonable plan.   I backpacked to the river and back late last October. Even then it was hot.  Hiking up from the river in the summer, in the afternoon, sounds miserable."
CampingandHiking,3c3n9f,CarlGauss,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:02:10 2015 UTC,"I would agree with you on the shuttle- my husband and I did a rim to rim hike, missed our origins shuttle pick up time (by 15 minutes!) but the service was very flexible and just picked us up the next day.  That being said,since OP stated that they weren't training for this, typically don't camp, are planning a late August trip, and want to do rim to rim to rim over the course of three days...? I would highly discourage this plan. I watched an ultra light hiker get helicoptered out of the canyon the day we were out- it's very sobering. If you're not in shape and packed appropriately, this hike can definitely kill you."
CampingandHiking,3c3n9f,untaken-username,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"That's good to know about the shuttle, thank you!  I'd probably lean more towards just taking the shuttle back.

CampingandHiking,3c3n9f,stunami,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:02:07 2015 UTC,"From what I've read Half Dome is about 15 miles round trip, with 4,800 feet of elevation gain. This is very similar to the South Kaibab trail, which is just over 7 miles (one way) and also 4,800'. The Bright Angel trail is a little less strenuous, but not by much (8 miles, 4300'). However the elevation change is misleading, as a portion of it is relatively flat. Dunno what the common routes are for a rim to rim hike."
CampingandHiking,3c4qce,johnnydontcare,2,Sat Jul 4 19:38:39 2015 UTC,Marmot for sure.  Free standing = less setup and takedown time.  Plus Marmot quality.
CampingandHiking,3c4qce,supernettipot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:36:02 2015 UTC,"The main difference here is that the Marmot is free-standing. So the Mystique is larger, lighter, and cheaper. (Though not all of the larger dimensions may be usable - as the walls come inwards you may lose more space with the Mystique than the Tungsten.)  If you feel comfortable that you can handle the slightly more sophisticated pitching of the Mystique with the stakes, then it sounds very attractive to me. But free-standing tents are more beginner-friendly.  Unfortunately I'm not really sure about quality of either brand. I'd say ALPS has a worse reputation, but I'm not sure that's a dealbreaker given the other advantages of the Mystique."
CampingandHiking,3c4qce,Acies,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:02:09 2015 UTC,"I'd personally go with the Marmot. Keep in mind, it's $140 on sale right now. It's normally a $180 tent. That's a nice savings, and indicative of the better build quality."

CampingandHiking,3c15qm,nivek222,5,Fri Jul 3 20:31:14 2015 UTC,"I got altitude sickness a couple times preparing for my climb of Whitney many years ago. Helped resolve it by eating and drinking a lot as I hiked, taking it fairly easy and not pushing myself or carrying a heavy pack (left the tent and pack at a lower elevation on the day we climbed up and down), and resting a lot.  Altitude Sickness ia  bear and a half. Best to come right down when you get it.  You can also acclimate to altitude by spending a day or more at a fairly high elevation before going farther up.  About 8,000 feet seems to be my point for starting to feel a little bad, so I camp there, eat like a horse and spend the night.  Slow and steady."

CampingandHiking,3bzmv2,Pksnc,7,Fri Jul 3 13:46:50 2015 UTC,By far my most favourite provincial park. Even the lands surrounding the park itself are some of the most beautiful places in the world. There are some smaller lakes that can be reached from the logging roads off of 637 that are basically untouched and are home to some of the most diverse wildlife in the area.
CampingandHiking,3bzmv2,colin666,7,Fri Jul 3 14:35:35 2015 UTC,Spent 6 days canoe camping last year there... so pretty!  Except that we started canoeing the first day at 8am and by 8:30am we had already taken a wrong turn and were lost (we didnt know it). 2PM we ended up in some place with no more water and were portaging our canoe in middle of nowhere when we realized we were landmarks and the points we thought we were seeing on the map were not really there. We turned around at 2pm and got unlost at about 6pm.  Good times :D
CampingandHiking,3bzmv2,foutight,4,Fri Jul 3 16:47:11 2015 UTC,Killarney is like a provincial park in a Grand Theft Auto game would be--all the best parts compressed into a convenient size for exploring.

CampingandHiking,3bzmv2,Glenbard,5,Fri Jul 3 15:57:17 2015 UTC,It is the nicest park I've visited for sure. Many of the lakes have only a few campsites. So seclusion is good for canoeists. You have to book the maximum 5 months in advance or you miss out. The more portages you take the more secluded it gets. No motorized boats are allowed in the park except a few lakes I think.   The hike to the crack was pretty well traveled. I was surprised by the amount of people. But apparently they opened a new trail that makes a day hike much more possible from the nearest road.
CampingandHiking,3bzmv2,Glenbard,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:21:15 2015 UTC,Thank you for your detailed reply. I look forward to visiting there. I love that they made motorized watercraft illegal there.
CampingandHiking,3bzmv2,houseofbeards,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:36:32 2015 UTC,Even backcountry sites have to be reserved? I read something online about just setting up camp at any empty campsite.
CampingandHiking,3bzmv2,SilverSeven,5,Fri Jul 3 23:44:43 2015 UTC,"Kind of.   Ontario Parks you reserve a lake. You take an open campsite on that lake. They require your itinerary. This is real back country and they need to know where people are, what colour their tents are, and how long they will be there.   You can just show up at the gate and book your trip there, but for highly desired lakes its advisable to book ahead of time."

CampingandHiking,3bzmv2,need_sub_help,2,Sat Jul 4 00:56:47 2015 UTC,Yeah it was a bit unsettling. I was actually looking through my binoculars trying to find bears on the other side of the lake. I turned around at some point and saw the bear.   We'd just taken the food down from the tree and cooked breakfast so that's probably what it was after. It didn't seem too worried about being near us so I think this bear has had luck before raiding this site and has become a little habituated to people.   We moved campsites after that. Next time we're bringing bear spray in case it turns into more of an issue.
CampingandHiking,3bzmv2,samjowett,2,Fri Jul 3 21:59:27 2015 UTC,"This happens to be my favorite place in the entire world (literally).  I used to love portaging up and hiking up to Lake Topaz.  It used to be quiet and pristine in the old days... the only route in was that hellish uphill portage... but there is some hiking trail in from a motor boat accessible lake which has killed the ""exclusivity"" of it.  It's still a gorgeous lake, it's just you have to be prepared to share it with people now (and these aren't no impact interior campers, these are cooler toting jetski folk, so there is the inevitable candy wrapper or pop can around).  Maybe I need to find a new favorite lake?  [stay tuned]"

A bit less accessible for the canoers though, so it's probably a bit less visited."

CampingandHiking,3c228e,Meninjesus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:11:54 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this, too. Sounds awesome, until the first snowfall. -20° and 3' of snow sucks in a tent without a wood stove or some kind of heat. Get a chainsaw and a maul, you'll definitely need to process a lot of wood. My buddies that heat their mountain homes with wood split wood all year long to store up for the winter.  It gets hard to cook in the winter, too, since a lot of fuels don't burn very well in really low temps. You'll go through a lot of propane, but that's not a huge issue.  What kind of vehicle do you have? Most of the roads you can camp on aren't plowed, and it gets tough to find reception to call into work.   Also, you're only allowed to spend like 40 out of every 60 days (or something like that) in the national forests, and you can't stay in one spot more than like 12 days, i think. You say you plan on moving your tent every night, though, so you probably shouldn't have a problem if you're keeping a low profile. You can also just move from national forest to national forest, but your commute will start to get longer.  Really the main issue comes down to dealing with weather (mainly the cold) without having an established site. It's pretty simple to build a small shelter to keep rain and snow off of your food and firewood, but it's tough to set up camp and build a fire when the conditions already exist, vs. being able to plan to combat the conditions.   Best wishes, though!"

CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,pooncartercash,2,Thu Jul 2 19:38:20 2015 UTC,"Everyone hikes differently. if you have backpacking experience and are in pretty good shape, 20 miles a day is a reasonable amount of hiking. If you start at Kennedy Meadows and hike to Castle Crags State Park, that's 800 miles for the entire Sierras. 800/20 is 40 days. If you took 9 zeros, or fewer zeros but less mileage per day, you're looking at around 7 weeks to hike the entire Sierra Nevada."

CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,pooncartercash,9,Fri Jul 3 16:43:18 2015 UTC,I've been vacillating over thru-hiking the AT vs. PCT and this video just made me choose the PCT.  So much less green tunnel!
CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,-KhmerBear-,7,Thu Jul 2 16:38:15 2015 UTC,PCT is the harder and more spectacular hike for sure.
CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,Almostcomatose,7,Thu Jul 2 18:23:59 2015 UTC,"Having done both, I found the PCT to be much easier."
CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,NotSure098475029,2,Thu Jul 2 19:10:16 2015 UTC,Really? Is it the long stretches of flat or what? Ive only done sections of the pct
CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,Almostcomatose,40,Thu Jul 2 19:13:10 2015 UTC,"It's complicated.  Physically, I found the PCT easier because it is graded more flat (for pack animals) whereas the AT just is a constant up and down with 0 flat sections. Look at the fact that you can complete both trails in the same amount of time, yet the PCT is 400 miles longer. You can pull longer mile days on the PCT back to back. My longest day on the AT was 26 miles, on the PCT it was 34 and I was 10 years older with knees that had already done the AT. Starting in OR, my daily goal was 30 miles/day. Also, the weather is significantly better on the PCT, until it isn't and then it is more deadly than the AT. Want to avoid rain for 4 months? Hike all of CA. Want to get rained on everyday for 4 months, hike the AT. With that said, my white skin had issues with the sun in CA, oh and the hot ass desert. There's pros and cons to each trail.  Mentally, the PCT was easier too and not just because I'd already gone through the thruhiking experience before and knew what mental issues would arise. It was FAR more scenic making everything more worthwhile. You don't have many states to go through on the PCT so you avoid the thought process that each state is a checkpoint... and then 700 mile VA comes along and destroys your mentality (aka the VA Blues).  There's many many articles on the net about this topic. Here's 1: http://backcountrybanter.com/2014/12/15/thru-hike-vs-pct-thru-hike-comparison-two-popular-long-trails-world-part-1/"

CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,Almostcomatose,4,Thu Jul 2 18:25:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Whats the highest point on the app trail compared to pct I wonder?... I'm gonna look....6643 ft for AT vs 13,153 ft on the PCT. But the AT has significantly more elevation change. 515,000 feet on AT vs 315,000 on PCT. I wonder if that is because half of California and a large portion of Oregon are flat?"
CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,-KhmerBear-,2,Thu Jul 2 18:40:44 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely want to go up Mt. Whitney, so 14,505' for me!  I've read that the PCT was graded for mules but I don't know if that accounts for the lower elevation change."
CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,NotSure098475029,5,Thu Jul 2 18:47:33 2015 UTC,"It's because the AT insists you visit every stupid peak regardless of whether there is a view from up top. The PCT is fine with you traversing the mountain.  Even with things like Whitney and the 7,000 foot descent down Jacinto, the PCT is easier on the body, generally speaking.  Read my response below for more info."

CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,paleal3s,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:25:11 2015 UTC,"Most the CDT is not completed. This requires really, really good navigational techniques. that means that you're doing a lot of trail on ground, where there is no trail. you can't just hike, you have to think constantly of where you are going. Also, there's much less people, so if you fuck up, you're pretty much on your own unless you hike with friends- and good luck finding friends to hike it with you. probably a lot more complicated but i've never done it so idk."

CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,aaronkz,16,Thu Jul 2 16:14:45 2015 UTC,"You're rarely going more than 5 days without crossing some sort of highway from which you can catch a ride to town. In the SoCal desert it's more like 3-4 days and the Sierras have some long stretches where you'd need to hike out a few miles to find a trailhead- one section in particular is an 8-12 day stretch.  The food options can be both bad and overpriced, which is why  resupply packages are very popular.   The trail has gotten popular enough that the locals at most trail towns are happy to cater to hikers."
CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,oliver_manhick,5,Thu Jul 2 16:35:41 2015 UTC,"Amazing. World away from Europe, you can have lunch and dinner in a restaurant on the majority of long distance trails. Nordics would be different I'd bet."
CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,NotSure098475029,3,Thu Jul 2 19:24:47 2015 UTC,Or buy the food at a store because why mail the same food across the country to a PO when it is already next door in the grocery.
CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,NotSure098475029,3,Thu Jul 2 17:15:26 2015 UTC,"And on the JMT, you don't have to mail yourself food everywhere, but mostly yes you do. It is popular to mail food to Reds Meadow, but you can also take the free bus down to Mammoth Lakes and resupply at the grocery store and at the dispensary too. ;-)"
CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,NotSure098475029,2,Thu Jul 2 19:10:56 2015 UTC,"http://www.halfwayanywhere.com/trails/pacific-crest-trail/pct-hiker-survey/  http://www.halfwayanywhere.com/trails/pacific-crest-trail/annual-pacific-crest-trail-thru-hiker-survey/  Read those surveys if you want. You'll see where people voted on where they would highly recommend you send a resupply box. In one of the surveys he asked where everyone resupplied at. You can see the numerical difference in number of resupply locations and the number of resupply locations people recommend you send a box to.  Generally, you have to mail boxes to everywhere in WA (although White Pass is not necessary if you're going to Packwood for a break). OR there are a couple of places and same with CA."
CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,NotSure098475029,2,Thu Jul 2 19:26:20 2015 UTC,"True to a point. Mailing yourself food can be expensive. If you have special dietary needs, mailing might be the only option.

Send fewer boxes  Send more food in boxes  Send a larger variety of food   Changes to your strategy?  Send fewer boxes (Overwhelmingly)  Send less food  Send a larger variety of food  Only send boxes from on-trail   Seems there is no general consensus as the responses are both ""send more boxes"" and ""send fewer boxes"".

CampingandHiking,3bvnyp,NotSure098475029,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:11:56 2015 UTC,"I suppose you have to read between the lines a bit. By saying they should send fewer boxes, they don't mean send 1 box to the PO instead of 2, they mean send 0 boxes instead of 1. Rarely would you ever send multiple food boxes to the same PO simply because of postage costs and the fact that if you can't fit all the food in 1 box, you won't fit it in your pack. Plus I've hiked a couple of trails and know the ins and outs of resupply strategies and what people come to like and regret about their strategy.  And most people don't send too much food, they send too much of the same food they've been eating for months and want diversity in what they eat (another huge pro to resuppy-as-you-go instead of prepping it all from home and mailing it)."

It's $89 including shipping, but based in the UK so I have no idea about customs. It's supposed to be rated at 35°F. From what I've read the quality is usually fine. Of course, if there is an issue it might be a hassle to return. It's kind of an exception though, because they use cheaper, heavier insulation. For a quilt you will generally pay about $170-180 for a synthetic one (Climashield Apex) or $230+ for a down one. The materials alone cost the manufacturers close to that."

CampingandHiking,3byt06,trashit123,10,Fri Jul 3 06:56:54 2015 UTC,"I've taken the Trailbus to/from the West Coast Trail on the logging roads a few times and talked to the drivers. The logging roads are scary. Trailbus has a radio and the driver constantly talks on it to announce which road he's on. This is to avoid having logging trucks routed on the same road or so that he can be told to avoid a certain road or wait for a truck to pass.  The trucks don't stop. This is something multiple Trailbus drivers stressed. It's not ""they don't want to stop"", it's not ""they are not allowed to stop"", it's not ""they are assholes asserting their right of way"", it's literally ""they don't stop"". They are so bloody heavy that the braking distance is more like a train if the brakes don't burn up in the first place. If one stops for whatever reason like a breakdown or the driver miscalculating how much momentum they need it can apparently be a multi-day operation to unload and get it going again. The logging roads are too narrow for you to meet a truck, two cars are fine, but car + truck means that the only way a car can survive is driving into the ditch which often isn't a ditch but a cliff.  The quality of the roads differs. This year they were quite fine, I even managed to get an hour or two of sleep. 2008 when I did it the first time they were so bad I was thrown out of the seat a few times (the bus that year was an old school bus with tractor tires and double suspension, much better than the crappy thing they had this year).  I have a fun story though. 2008 was also the year when we had a breakdown. The bus was driving on a particularly bad road bouncing and shaking all over the place, but the driver was still in a good chatty mood. Suddenly we hear a huge bang and within seconds the driver stops, jumps out of the bus, looks under it, runs back into the drivers seat goes completely quiet and just floors it. We fly for a while, ask him what's wrong and he just says something like ""shut up, I need to get us closer to civilization as fast as possible"". Minutes later the brakes seize and we stop in the middle of nowhere. What happened was that the bang was probably a rock flung from the tire that hit the relief valve on the tank with compressed air and the reason the driver panicked was because we were losing pressure and he wanted to get closer to civilization so that when the brakes seize (they fail safe which means they need pressure to open) we'd be out of radio shadow. First thing we do is to look at the relief valve, but it took one touch to make it fall off completely, there was no way to fix it. The driver goes to the radio, luckily we're out of radio shadow and manage to talk to someone who talks to someone who talks to someone who has a landline. They use the phone to contact Trailbus main office and we get told that a repair truck will be sent, but we shouldn't expect it until the next day. At the same time the logging company is apparently (this gets forwarded to us by the only radio we had contact with) swearing their heads off because it's a major operation to reroute everything.  So we see that there's water nearby, I see that there are plenty of hanging spots for my hammock, we have some food left, everything should be fine. We focus on the air tank instead, first we try to just shove a large stick into the hole. That doesn't work. So the Swiss guy takes out his Swiss army knife and sharpens the stick, we shove the stick into the hole and use some rope to try to keep it in place as hard as possible start up the compressor and we get some pressure, but not enough. We could probably get enough pressure to unlock the brakes and get a few km further, but the compressor pumps constantly just to keep that minimal amount of pressure. That's not good enough, the compressor has to cycle otherwise it will burn up.  I take some duct tape (always have some duct tape on my hiking poles, saved my ass twice now), wrap it around the top of the stick to create a good seal (glue side both on the stick and on the outside), we shove the stick into the hole again, tie it as hard as we can with the rope, start up the bus and the compressor cycles! The McGyvered bus survives long enough to get us back home. The compressor worked fine and didn't stop cycling until we were a few blocks from the bus terminal in Victoria.  Here's a picture of the McGyvered air tank."

It took quite a while and lots of attempts to get the whole contraption to be tight enough. We almost gave up a few times. The driver later admitted that he had given up and expected to wait the night for the repair truck and he was only playing along with our fiddling because their manual said that in hopeless situations like that he's supposed to ""be seen doing something""."

Either hike a bit to the nearest civilization which wasn't more than 15-20km away and get help or just wait until the logging company wonders why Trailbus hasn't announced anything for a while and send out someone to look where we announced our last position. I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have sent a truck on our road until they knew it was clear.  We'd be a day late back to Victoria but that's something you always plan for anyway.

Sounds like one of those situations where you are nervously laughing at the ridiculousness and hilarity of the situation combined with the knowledge of how badly it could go down. Glad it all worked out.  About 30 years ago as a child in northern Sweden, some friends whitnessed an accident where a logging truck offed it's load onto a car on a road. Not a pretty scene. They were traumatized for weeks. So yes, now i understand (am reminded) that it's just not a simple thing for one to stop easily when confronted with an unexpected vehicle in the road, let alone swerve.  I think i'll avoid certain logging roads unless i'm with someone who has and knows how to use the radio and has a better understanding of the area.  thanks again for your feedback and story!"
CampingandHiking,3byt06,dont_worry2012,5,Fri Jul 3 16:52:51 2015 UTC,"Tree planter for 4 seasons here, lots of time spent on logging roads. Personally I wouldn't drive on an active logging road without an escort or a radio. You want to be able to announce your location and listen to theirs, you simply call your kilometre and direction of travel. The roads  are often not wide enough for a logging truck and you to pass so it can be very dangerous. Of course it depends on the road, some are well maintained and wide so you'd have to talk to someone who's been on the roads in question."
CampingandHiking,3byt06,Pashtacular,2,Fri Jul 3 16:40:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback. I'll definitely do my research in that case before travelling along ones i'm not familiar with. We travelled down a few last fall in BC, and it really seemed totally fine. I was confused as to why my friend seemed so apprehensive about taking it. I guess we got lucky and it had recently been widened. Also, i don't recall any great huge trucks passing us at all on that road. If they had, maybe it would have felt more nerve-wracking. I'll definitely be careful. Thanks again."
CampingandHiking,3byt06,dont_worry2012,2,Fri Jul 3 16:45:44 2015 UTC,"Logging roads are dangerous because they are not well maintained and can be on the edge of a cliff with no barricade, but as far as a truck running you over and not stopping.. thats a pretty serious crime for them to commit just for a job, just realize that it can be hard for them to stop and sometimes hard for them to pass. Keep vigilant and you will be fine."
CampingandHiking,3c03ez,michaeljiz,2,Fri Jul 3 15:36:37 2015 UTC,"Pinchot trail is very easy going but relatively uneventful. There are some nice campsites along streams about 7 or 8 miles in though. The loyalsock-link loop is about an hour to 1.5 hours west of Pinchot trail but is much more interesting. The Haystacks are at the mid point of the trail and are really cool. It's a bit longer at like 21 miles but definitely doable for an overnight though it would be more than 4-5 hours of hiking each day. Worlds End, the state park the Loyalsock trail runs through, it's awesome. Never seen so many waterfalls in one area and there are plenty of trails to explore. Never been through thunder swamp but I've heard it isn't crowded and gives some solitude. But I have also heard it is uneventful, there aren't many vistas on the eastern part of PA until you get to DE water gap.   DE water gap could also be a consideration and it blows the other areas out of the water in terms of views, unfortunately it is also super crowded. More so on a holiday too."
CampingandHiking,3c03ez,peaheezy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:11:24 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're looking for a day hike, and not an overnight hike?  For future reference, /r/hiking is probably a better place to ask about day hikes- this sub focuses more on overnight trips into the backcountry.  The trails that you mentioned are all backpacking trails, and none of them are suitable to be hiked as a day hike in their entirety.  However, you could easily just do a section of any of them as a day hike.  The Pinchot Trail has a couple of interestecting sections- namely Big Pine Hill, which has an observation platform, and Choke Creek, which has some cascades and nice hiking alongside, as well as a nice set of waterfalls near Butler Run (be sure to look up directions on how to find them in advance).  Big Pine Hill can be accessed from the traditional start of the Pinchot Trail on Route 2016, while to get a bit closer to Choke Creek, you probably want to drive down Tanner Road and Phelps Road.  You can view a map of the Pinchot Trail here:  http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/cs/groups/public/documents/document/dcnr_002043.pdf  World's End State Park is another good bet.  You could definitely do sections of the Loyalsock and Link Trails.  High Rock Vista and the Loyalsock Canyon Vista are both worth climbing too (you can also drive to the Loyalsock Canyon Vista).  Double Run has lots of pretty cascades, and you can hike up through it on your way to the Loyalsock Canyon Vista.  Haystack Rapids is further upstream and is more easily accessed from Route 220 but is also worth visiting.  You can view a map of the trails in the vicinity of World's End State Park here:  http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/cs/groups/public/documents/document/dcnr_002940.pdf  Another option that comes to mind is the Old Loggers Path, a 25 mile loop trail in the Loyalsock State Forest.  In particular, the Rock Run section of the trail is very scenic, with multiple waterfalls and cascades, especially where Yellow Dog Run joins Rock Run.  There are also decent views from Sullivan Mountain the western section of the trail, and from Sharp Top Vista on the southern portion of the trail.  You can drive to Sharp Top Vista, however, the roads in this area were severely damaged by Hurricane Irene and may not have been repaired yet.  I've also heard that the nearby MacIntyre Wild Area is very scenic, but I've not personally been there.    You can view a map of the Old Loggers Path here:  http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/cs/groups/public/documents/document/dcnr_20027896.pdf  For more information about possible day hikes in eastern PA, you might find this book to be of use:  http://www.amazon.com/Explorers-Guide-Hikes-Eastern-Pennsylvania/dp/0881509973  Another possibility might be a section of the Old Loggers Path.  The OLP is a 25 mile loop trail in the Loyalsock State Forest."

I work at North Bend State Park in Cairo, West Virginia and we have an exact program for this! The program is tuned where you do not have to do anything you are uncomfortable doing, and can select a package that fits you perfectly. So, we can take anyone on a 2 or 3 day backcountry hike, camp, and have dehydrated meals or pack our own backpacking food that you would find on a real trip, or we can go a little more luxury and have someone else from the park deliver us a cooler to our location and grill some steaks and vegetables over an open fire and bake some potatoes. If that sounds a little too much, we can hike all day on some of our more tame, clear trails and then go campout in a more secluded campground or backcountry area. The main point being, you tell us what you would like and we will cater to that. Our guides (including myself) are all experienced and great people who are passionate about doing this and we would love to host them!

So rather than carry something that's doing nothing, why not get rid of that part of the bag and carry less? Once you do that you're left with a quilt.  As a half step between the two, Big Agnes makes sleeping bags that are still closed in the back but have no insulation there, and instead give you a fabric sleeve to slide your pad into."

It seems to me that if you have to tuck the quilt in underneath you to avoid drafts, you might as well have a whole bag that won't open up in the night.   I don't have much trouble with that, personally, but I also do most of my camping in a hammock where I've got an underquilt wrapping around the bottom and sides of my hammock. I do ""ground-dwell"" when I'm out with my whole family, and then I do still use my top quilt though that tends to be mostly in warmer weather just because my wife likes the cold less than I do.  If you move around a lot when you sleep drafts may be a bigger issue for you. Really, though, that's why people use straps to keep the sides of the quilt down.  On the flipside, being able to vent a quilt in warmer weather is a godsend. Still, it's not massively different from sleeping in a sleeping bag with it completely unzipped -- just less to carry in your pack.   That Big Agnes bag sounds pretty awesome though. I have their Seed house Light 2 tent, I love how light their stuff is!   I've been using one of their mummy bags for several years now, and I love it.

CampingandHiking,3bvf8u,filluppp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:02:55 2015 UTC,"All fills (synthetic or down) work by loft, i.e., trapping air.  If you lay on the fill it gets squished flat and no longer insulates.  So a quilt removes the part underneath you and lets the pad do the insulating.  To make it even better, now you can take the fill that you removed from underneath you and add it to the top for no additional weight and even more loft.  A quilt is therefore lighter for the same temperature rating since it makes more efficient use of the fill material.  /edit-as a comparison my EE 20 degree Revelation in a regular/regular size weighs 612g complete, with the stuff sack and straps.  That's just about 22 oz.  Compare that to a Western Mountaineering Ultralite in a regular size rated to 20 degrees, and it weighs 29 oz for the bag alone. The WM bag is just about as high end as it gets and costs over twice as much as the Revelation.  So the quilt is also quite the bargain if you're looking to shed weight-7 oz lighter and half the price."

At 24 miles, it's a little bit longer than your max distance, but the trail is split into two halves and it is relatively easy to just do the north or the south half.    The Pinchot Trail a nice trail, but nothing special.  Some scenic hiking through dry oak and sassafras forest, and some nice waterfront campsites, mostly along Choke Creek (although Choke Creek is relatively small).  If you do it, be sure to add on side trips to the observation tower on Big Pine Hill, and to Choke Creek Falls.  Neither of these destinations is actually on the Pinchot Trail, and adding side trips to them does help to spruce up your trip significantly.    The best part about the Pinchot Trail is that it doens't seem to get a huge amount of use, despite being relatively close to some major urban areas (Scranton to the west, and NYC to the east).  It makes for a good easy weekend getaway to a relatively quiet area without having to drive far.    There is also the Thunder Swamp Trail, which has many of the same attributes as the Pinchot Trail- a lack of distinctly spectacular scenery, but generally quiet and little used (despite literally being just up the road from the Deleware Water Gap).  The TST is also a little bit longer than what you are looking for, but if you just do the main loop and skip the side loop out and around Big Bear Swamp, then it is about 17 miles.    Some other options that come to mind include both the Loyalsock Link Loop and the Old Loggers Path.  The Loyalsock Link Loop is 17 miles, and is centered on World's End State Park.  There are some overlooks with spectacular views out over the Loyalsock Canyon, and some nice hiking alongside cascading streams.  Unfortunately, by just doing the main loop and skipping the side trail to Route 220, you miss the Haystack Rapids, with are particularly scenic, but the trail is still worth hiking nonetheless.  The Old Loggers Path is a 25 mile loop, but again, you can just do a portion of it.  The Northern Half is particularly scenic, with lots of cascades and waterfalls along Rock Run, and some nice views from Sullivan Mountain.    I hope this is helpful!"

CampingandHiking,3by9bz,hobbykitjr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:15:16 2015 UTC,"Look at the AT  It's rocky, plenty of great views. But water is tricky sometimes. Since you'll often have to travel down to get to water.  The section over the Lehigh tunnel is nice, keep going west and you'll hit bake oven knob, then Dan's pulpit, the pinnacle,  and pulpit rock..  Check out that sub for details on the Appalachian trail.  Or Google for an interactive map that shows parking and shelters.  Might need a guide book for finding water. There's markers on trail usually"

It's a little rough but once you get back in there the road splits and goes up an incline and at the top you'll find a killer camping spot.   I recommend anyone who has an extra day out there to check it out. To my knowledge it's a pretty well kept secret spot and you get an incredible view of the range. As you can see it puts you right on level with the mountains for a completely unobstructed view."

CampingandHiking,3bxg3w,trashit123,2,Thu Jul 2 23:18:59 2015 UTC,"Hard to say without seeing it. How was it packed away? If it was compressed then it could be normal and it'll take a little while for it to loft back up. Give it a while and fluff it around with your hands, like you're plumping a large pillow which is more or less what you're doing.  If you're really concerned and you're thinking it's missing some fill you can weigh it and see if it's far off from what its specs say it should be."
CampingandHiking,3bxg3w,HeyRememberThatTime,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:13:03 2015 UTC,"It was not tightly compressed in the packing it arrived in, so i don't think that is the issue. It seems very thin all-around, (except on the front near the top seems very sparse, which i imagine should be one of the loftiest spots), which is odd to me. Especially since it's rated at 15 degrees.  I am going to see if i can find a store which has them in stock and go in person to view it and see how it compares."
CampingandHiking,3bxg3w,GoNorthYoungMan,2,Fri Jul 3 00:54:12 2015 UTC,"I have the Encampment 15, and its pretty thin too, especially compared to my 0 degree bag.   But it is great though, within a proper expected range.  For me (and others on past postings too), the 15 degree bags are only solid to low 40s or maybe high 30s.  Anything approaching freezing or colder, and you should expect to be wearing a puffy coat and long johns etc.  If its been packed for that long, hopefully it will fluff out a bit more if you hang it and shake it a bit over a few days.  Don't store it like that yo!"
CampingandHiking,3bxg3w,GoNorthYoungMan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:16:31 2015 UTC,"ok thanks for letting me know that yours seems pretty thin too. Yes i have been warned not to compress it when storing it. I am still not convinced it's not too thin, so i am going to go into a camping store if i can find a local one that stocks them and check the ones in the store out.   And thanks also for the heads up on the temperature rating. Having read soooo many reviews on sooo many bas, it seems that bags that are true to their rating are few and far between!"
CampingandHiking,3bwkt5,trashit123,2,Thu Jul 2 19:13:41 2015 UTC,"It normally takes a couple of days to acclimate to a higher elevation. Maybe start out the first day getting organized and then a shorter hike the second day to see how you feel. Drink lots of water.  When I first tried using hiking poles, I thought they were clumsy and in the way, but after I started using them and figured out the right way to use them I now have them along on most all hikes.  I do have a set up where I can tie them on to the side of my pack for when I don't need them, but any time I am crossing streams, going over rough terrain or climbing, I will use them.  Once you get on to them, it is great having two more points of contact with the ground. They have saved me from face planting many times."
CampingandHiking,3bwkt5,realoldfatguy,2,Thu Jul 2 19:53:57 2015 UTC,Thank you for your feedback! I have heard the same about hiking poles. One friend said much the same as you.... I will consider getting them i think. (do you by chance have any recommendation for lightweight poles that fold up small and aren't a regrettable purchase?)  Now i am worried about our DW plan and feel like we should do as you say... spend one day on a shorter hike first. We will have to rearrange our permits and hotel stay. Oh well. Better safe than sorry i suppose.
CampingandHiking,3bwkt5,realoldfatguy,2,Thu Jul 2 20:08:42 2015 UTC,"I use Leki hiking poles (mine are older but similar to these ) and have been very happy with them. They collapse down to about 24 inches.  Here is a video from Leki on adjusting your poles.  Also, note how she puts her hands in the straps.  They work much better when you use them this way.  You can roll your hand toward your thumb at the end of your stride to give yourself a little extra push.  They also have a lifetime warranty (however, only a one year warranty on the carbon fiber shafts).  If they break, Leki will fix or replace them."

CampingandHiking,3bwkt5,GoNorthYoungMan,2,Thu Jul 2 20:53:54 2015 UTC,"Unless you have a history of elevation woe, it really shouldn't be bad at all, especially since you're already staying there a night. It's not terribly high up, and many thousands of people go to Tahoe and the Sierra from the Bay Area to even greater heights with no issues. When I make the drive from sea level to 9,000ft in a few hours, I can certainly feel the difference during times of exertion, and may get a little light headed if I haven't been hydrating, but it quickly passes. Echo is at about 7,200ft, which is very manageable. Of course, you'll be loaded down with a heavy pack, and it'll probably be hot, so just take it easy. It looks like your itinerary is very manageable, and that loop isn't very strenuous, so it's definitely not something I would consider altering hotel and permit plans over.  As for the hiking poles, it sounds like you're taking the PCT from Echo, past Aloha? All of those trails are very well beaten, especially the PCT, so I would consider poles if you think they'll help you distribute the weight of your pack, not necessarily due to any issues with the terrain. I'm sure you'll be going off trail a lot, but that would likely be after you've set up camp and are heading out to explore, so you won't be as encumbered.   You'll be great!"

I bet sunfish pond would be a lot less crowded because it is a 11 mile or so loop from the parking area. Don't expect anything resembling solitude but it is really beautiful.

""Oh, you want to easily take a picture of a large group of people, get a wider panorama, or take a pic at a height higher than you could normally reach?

If I saw some taken from other people or positioned moderately well I'd be fine. People like to see themselves. Whatever.   But those selfie sticks make awful photos that really aren't worthy of anything more than posting on Facebook for a quick ""look where I am"" moment."

CampingandHiking,3bnh1j,mclovin39,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:37:26 2015 UTC,"Not OP but we were just there and stayed at Sprague Creek. Before we went we read that the Many Glacier campground was the one you wanted to stay at but when we drove there we didn't think it was that nice. It wasn't wooded and kind of looked overgrown, it did have a great view of the mountains though.  Sprague Creek was wooded and lovely with paths that go down to a lake. It was a great camp site.   The various camp sites are first come first served so you have to get there early in the morning to get a site. This website has information on the fill times for the various sites. http://home.nps.gov/applications/glac/cgstatus/cgstatus.cfm"
CampingandHiking,3bnh1j,TinyGymMouse,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:08:38 2015 UTC,I think the Many Glacier campground is so popular primarily because it has the easiest/quickest access to what I consider to be like 4 of the 6 best hikes in the entire park.   ...but you really can't go wrong anywhere you camp or hike in that beautiful place!

CampingandHiking,3bs1gv,gemolojest,6,Wed Jul 1 18:06:39 2015 UTC,"Weather and altitude are critical factors, so it's kinda hard to say.  Personally, I can go 2-3 liters in 8 hours if it's cool out, or easily more than a liter per hour if it's hot/dry. You kinda gotta know your own water baseline needs and work from there.  Is there a lot of water along the route?  If so, just get a sawyer filter water bottle or sawyer mini filter inline with a hydration bladder and use that.  No sense carrying water if you don't have to."
CampingandHiking,3bs1gv,goyploy,2,Wed Jul 1 18:10:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this.  Weather/altitude gain/personal fitness are going to make your water needs vary.   I think 1 liter/4 miles is generally a good rule of thumb.  However, you're day hiking, not backpacking, you can probably spare to bring a little extra water since you don't have 20 lbs. of gear on your back.  Imho, I wouldn't bring a purifier.  I've hiked Half Dome numerous times (16.5 mi round trip, 4000 ft. elevation gain) and I bring a purifier every time:  I never use it and I always ask myself why I brought it.  Iodine pills would probably be an OK, uncumbersome alternative, if you really want to have a backup plan.  One user recommended buying gear from REI.  I love REI, but if you're looking for a cheap hydration pack, I wouldn't recommend them.  If you're looking for a good pack that'll last you 10 years or a good pair of boots, go to REI.  If you're looking to keep it cheap, try Amazon, a store like Big 5 (cheap sporting goods store on the West Coast), or even Target.  The quality will suffer a little, but the products will work and it sounds like they'll meet your needs.  Many hydration packs come in very small sizes (10 - 14 liters of storage).  Keep in mind what you actually intended to bring on trail with you, and make sure your pack is big enough accommodate that.  A pack in the 20 - 30 liter range would probably be sufficient for your needs.  Personally, I don't like to buy packs online because I want to at least try them on, but in the 20 - 30 liter range, sizes probably won't vary that wildly.  Something like this might be what you're looking for."
CampingandHiking,3bs1gv,tozeyhussle,3,Thu Jul 2 15:59:15 2015 UTC,"I usually go through a liter per 4-5 miles.  Your water consumption will vary based on your fitness level, how much elevation gain you're doing, and the weather.  After a few bad experiences with bringing an inadequate amount of water, I've since gotten in the habit of packing far more than I need-- usually a 3L bladder+2 1L nalgenes for a ~10 mile hike.  That way, I can drink as much as I want without worrying about running out, and I'm in a position to help out if I come across someone on the trail who didn't bring enough for themselves."
CampingandHiking,3bs1gv,IAmVladimirPutinAMA,2,Wed Jul 1 19:04:07 2015 UTC,"It sounds like those will be pretty strenuous hikes, so you might need about 2-3 liters per person per day. 3 liters weighs about 6.6 lbs (3 kg). You may want to carry all that water each day, but you can also look for some other sources of water, including springs, streams, and snow. If you are finding water, be sure to bring some purifier tablets or a water filter to ensure no one gets sick."
CampingandHiking,3bs1gv,Truthful_Lee_II,2,Wed Jul 1 19:06:41 2015 UTC,"It depends. I typically don't carry more than 3 liters at any 1 time. I try to have breaks / lunch / camp near water. That way I can filter from the source and refill my bottles. A Sawyer Squeeze / mini is relatively light/cheap and does a great job of purifying water with minimal effort. There are also lots of chemicals like iodine, aquamira, and bleach that do the job too. Or even electric lights that murder all harmful critters in your water - called Steripen's.      Do some research on the trails to see if they pass by water. If yes - then plan to refill along the way and carry less water weight.        REI.com is a fine place to buy a bladder. I recommend the Platypus Big Zip."

CampingandHiking,3bsjje,FullyGrownAdult,3,Wed Jul 1 20:14:24 2015 UTC,"There's not much near Rochester.  Your best bet would be to check out a portion of the Finger Lakes Trail or one of the side trails.  The FLT is somewhat lacking in scenic vistas and remote locations, but it does provide for some nice easy hiking through pastoral farmland and woods, and generally doesn't get too much use so solitude often isn't hard to find.    Letchworth State Park, about 45 minutes south of Rochester, has a 25 mile linear trail that is part of the FLT network that stretches the length of the park, with 2 backcountry shelters.    There is also the section of the Finger Lakes Trail/North Country National Scenic Trail that runs through Allegany State Park.  There are 3 or 4 shelters located along this stretch of the FLT.  Where are you going to be traveling from?  Will you be driving?  You've got the Adirondacks to the northeast, the Catskills to the southeast, and the PA wilds to the south.  All of those areas have numerous backpacking options, but they are also at least several hours away from Rochester."
CampingandHiking,3bsjje,DSettahr,2,Wed Jul 1 21:52:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I'm thinking I might head northeast to the Adirondacks, I know there are some good lakes for smallmouth fishing and I might be able to rent a canoe and find a remote spot to camp on. We'll see, thanks again."
CampingandHiking,3brjg0,LannyMerma,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:57:49 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, unless you link up with a group who have extra passes you likely will not be able to summit Whitney this year. However that doesnt mean you still cant see some beautiful portions of the eastern Sierra.    Mt. Langley at 14,032 feet is just south of Whitney. In fact you still take the Whitney Portal road when you get into Lone Pine. Ive summited Langey before and its a great time. The trail up to Cottonwood Lakes is great and there is great fishing up there as well. The next day you can take Old Army Pass up to the summit of Langley which is mainly class 1, with only a small portion of class 2  near the summit.

CampingandHiking,3bql37,PrincessHumperdink,6,Wed Jul 1 10:17:04 2015 UTC,"My only suggestion is beans.  Take cooked beans and dehydrate them (don't bring bagged dried beans!).  Black beans and small red beans are my favorites, bring some instant rice mixed with seasoning and you have a killer ""just add water"" meal."
CampingandHiking,3bql37,JR005,3,Wed Jul 1 12:07:45 2015 UTC,"Beans are good. And I've found you can always ""cheat"" and get away with a baggie of drained, previously canned beans for the first night's dinner. No dehydration required. Also, chickpeas with couscous and seasoning is a great vegan meal."
CampingandHiking,3bql37,PapaErskine,3,Wed Jul 1 14:50:01 2015 UTC,What do you eat at home? That's the question I always ask backpackers looking for trail meals. It's surprisingly easy to find dehydrated options or just well packaged ingredients of nearly all foods. You can shop the 'grocery' section of Packit Gourmet or make your own.
CampingandHiking,3bql37,cwcoleman,3,Wed Jul 1 14:28:21 2015 UTC,"couscous + whatever your heart desires (nuts, fruits, berries, vege)"
CampingandHiking,3bql37,BeastroMath,2,Wed Jul 1 16:42:49 2015 UTC,"Textured vegetable protein (TVP) is a good vegan source of protein.  It is pretty bland by itself, but if you make it with broth it will absorb the flavor pretty well.  You can use it to make TVP salad sandwiches in advance, or as an add-in to other meals for more protein.  Rice and beans together are a complete protein.  Quinoa is a complete protein by itself.  Both can make good backpacking meals if you have a stove that simmers well, with added in broths and vegetables."
CampingandHiking,3bql37,DSettahr,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:33:29 2015 UTC,"It's a question of whether you want something you can just eat or if you're actually going to cook.  There's always stuff like granola, or some of its constituents by themself (nuts, oatmeal, deydrated fruit).  I've had ramen w/ beans before, but never w/ bean sprouts.  I've always wanted to try that (seems like it'd go together pretty well).    There's a few spice combos I'm fond of that go well w/ ramen, like curry+chili, or ginger+garlic. otoh, you could always just bring some tortillas and refried beans.  Maybe if space/weight is an issue, you can keep a few meals simple, and do something special at the end of the day (to cut back on supplies).  That way it's not all pb sandwiches/powerbars, but it's not all lentil-loafs either :)"

If your rehydrating instructions are longer on whatever you have, just let that stuff sit in water before you turn on the stove. Should give you a thick hardy soup."

CampingandHiking,3bql37,fabloube,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:42:02 2015 UTC,"Ramen works well. There are a couple of the freeze dried mountain house meals that are vegan (katmandu curry is one).   We usually do freezer bag ""cooking"" so all we need to do for hot food is boil water. I made some insulators to keep the heat in, but you can just use a hat or something.   Breakfast is easy. Oatmeal with other grains/stuff. I make sure to add quinoa flakes so we get extra protein and it's more filling.  We dehydrate a lot of our own stuff. A can of lentil soup with some acini de pepe (tiny little pasta pieces) or ""mini spaghetti"" will be a great meal and the smaller/thinner pastas rehydrate well without having to cook them before hand and then dehydrate.  If you don't care about price then Outdoor Herbivore has some great stuff. Not all of it is vegan, but they label well."

CampingandHiking,3brz5w,Architect0126,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:16:12 2015 UTC,"My first backpacking trip was 3 days in sneakers. Many people into ultralight hiking prefer trail running shoes.  Boots are just one option. Definitely not mandatory.  Whatever footwear you decide to use, test it on smaller day hikes first. And if you decide to buy boots, break them in before going on a long trip."
CampingandHiking,3brz5w,IAmVladimirPutinAMA,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:12:44 2015 UTC,"I've heard of people through-hiking the whole Appalachian Trail in Teva sandals.  Personally, I use hiking shoes like these.  A bit beefed up compared to normal sneakers, but far lighter and less bulky than boots.  I'd suggest that you keep doing your increasingly difficult hikes in your sneakers for now.  If you eventually feel like you need more ankle support, then you can replace them with boots."

I think my ankles are pretty good at the moment, but my current sneakers have been through 2 cross country seasons and a track season. They have 500+ miles on them and the wear is starting to show. I'm not running in them anymore because I fear the wear on the shoes will affect by joints and running. That's why I'm looking at separate shoes for hiking and running."
CampingandHiking,3brz5w,afunkthewmd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:31:08 2015 UTC,"Separate hiking and running shoes is definitely a good call if you do both regularly.  If you're not too concerned about ankle injuries, don't bother with boots."

CampingandHiking,3brtd5,theenglandguy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:08:15 2015 UTC,"A large tarp + rope for shelter could be 1 solution. Instead of everyone buying tents, or 1 huge heavy one - a tarp is social and fun. Bugs are a problem though...      Everyone still needs some sort of sleeping bag and pad. These can be walmart cheap if the summer temps won't drop below 50F/10C.     Backpack is probably the biggest expense. See if they already have something that works (30-60 liters in size). Renting is another fine option. You may even be able to find quality used options, I know my town has a great craigslist offering, plus retail stores that sell used gear.       A group stove, water filter, bear bag, maps, and first aid kit works well.      Other personal items they need include a torch/headlamp, TP, water bottles, and clothes of course."
CampingandHiking,3brtd5,cwcoleman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:32:51 2015 UTC,"Any ideas for a relatively small, inexpensive pack for beginners? Something around 40L? Thanks!"
CampingandHiking,3brtd5,cwcoleman,2,Wed Jul 1 20:05:49 2015 UTC,"No, sorry - I'm not really good with that sort of item. I personally tend to buy 'the best' when I invest in outdoor gear. I understand that doesn't work well for beginners, but that just isn't my forte.         My best advice is to buy used. Rather than buying a $40 amazon/china/walmart pack that is going to break after a few uses and hurt the user - you could haggle a guy on craigslist down to $50 for a quality pack and get something that will last. The problem is fit with both solutions. A cheap bag and a used bag both may not fit well - until you start spending real money ($150+) on a backpack and trying out different options - you are going to struggle.      You also have to answer the question about the rest of the kit before a backpack is chosen. Beginners normally have big loads (they haven't learned what is most important and how to drop the rest). That means the 'cheap' bags are even worse decisions because they don't handle weight well. This also cuts out the option of most 'ultralight' bags. There are a few frameless packs that work well for people who have their full load out weight below 30 pounds. You may need to wait until you see what the sleeping system, shelter, water situation, food choices, clothing requirements, etc. are until you pick a backpack. Depending on those answers you may need something bigger/smaller.        Check out MEC for on-sale options. We have REI here in the US and they often have sales of their name brand equipment for very reasonable equipment."
CampingandHiking,3brtd5,travelinzac,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:21:38 2015 UTC,"When with groups I swap out my isobutane stove and sawyer mini for a white gas MSR dragonfly with a 2L pot that it nests in and a Katadyn pump. It isn't totally necessary but I can boil water for 4 dehydrated meals/4 cups of coffee or tea all at once; And filter liters of water for everyone in just a few minutes. It beats waiting to boil water for one of us at a time and the painfully slow filtering of a squeeze and can be broken up as group weight. I have room for one other person under my tarp if need be. In general if a friend has clothing (NO COTTON, this is my one hard line), a 35+ liter backpack, and a bag/pad (which i have extra and can loan), they can go backpacking with me. Few other small things, flashlight, plastic coffee cup, spoon, whatever random water bottles (I get smart waters free), etc."

CampingandHiking,3bm6h0,MatthewMeredith,7,Tue Jun 30 15:34:26 2015 UTC,"I really don't see the difference between this and a normal backpack.   Front + Top access: Pretty much every company has them. That ""feature"" is decades old. High capacity: 40+15 liters are not ""high capacity"". That's normal. ""Organized pockets"": I actually don't like them, I prefer to have just a big backpack. But anyway, that's nothing special. Rainproof: I guess we don't have to talk about this ""feature"".   I don't see any situation, where a good 50 liter backpack wouldn't be better. I mean a 50 liter backpack does not have to be 50 liters big in volume if it's half filled. You strap it tight and it's about 30, maybe 35. Additional packs on the side just lead to bad weight distribution. And if I really have a hike where I need to carry 15 - 20 kg for a week non stop, I prefer to have a proven back system from brands known for backpacks."
CampingandHiking,3bm6h0,deickneim,11,Tue Jun 30 15:45:40 2015 UTC,"That waist strap looked pretty flimsy, and the back pad didn't look like it offered much support/rigidity.

CampingandHiking,3bm6h0,shaggorama,2,Tue Jun 30 12:38:22 2015 UTC,"I got an Osprey porter recently just for travel - it's similar in the way that the straps can zip up and it becomes like a carry-on bag. It packs down tight so I managed not to check in any luggage for my two week trip.  But if you're looking for something that can double as a backpacking/travel bag I would check out the Osprey Farpoint. I really liked it but it's a bit big to carry on a plane and I already have a full backpacking pack.   I'm not trying to advertise for Osprey but I've always had good experiences with their bags, they're just on the pricier side."

So I bought a Farpoint 40 about a month ago.  It's performed very well, but I've only used it on one flight and a couple of car trips so far.  Usually one can get away with an overly-large carry-on, but I wanted a bag which would be virtually certain fit on any reasonably-size passenger plane.  For backpacking however, 40L is getting on the small side.  So, as always there are trade-offs."

If you don't stop it then it gets sent to SAR. No clue how to contact them exactly - but it sounds like an interesting solution...      I think you'd need some sort of service where identities are verified and money is paid. Not necessiarally integrated to local SAR / authorities - but deep knowledge of their procedures and processes of finding lost hikers.
CampingandHiking,3bnny3,cwcoleman,4,Tue Jun 30 20:41:07 2015 UTC,"A lot of wilderness preserves require permits, these permits have dates and times you are in and out along with contact information for emergencys.   Another good option is telling a friend or family member when you will be back and what to do if you do not arrive at that time."
CampingandHiking,3bnny3,strickt,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:04:09 2015 UTC,"Ranger station.  If I'm going alone I stop by the ranger station (in NPS you drop by one to get a wilderness permit anyway) and let them know my itinerary. My folks/friends always have a copy of the itinerary, number in group, estimated arrival/departure times, etc...  However as for an automated Dead Man's Switch I could see that getting abused/forgotten about or just plain you run a day late and trip SAR. If you're that worried pick up a Delorme InReach (recommended) or a spot (still very good, I just don't like the subscription options) or a PLB (great for SAR not so great for communicating in less-than-life & death situations). You can trip SAR if needed that way."
CampingandHiking,3bnny3,Flatline42,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:32:32 2015 UTC,Sounds like a hole in the market... I agree that most people just use their friends/family/coworkers - but if you don't have these things - who is there to watch out for you?     A personal locator beacon would be one option. You pay for a one-time or subscription service and at the press of a button get SAR to your exact location. Arguably more helpful than a note with grandma.      May I ask what your exact situation is why you need such a service? Is there absolutely no one you could leave trip info with who would contact authorities if you fail to return? Is a PLB an option for you?

If I think there's a chance that'll dry before I have to pack it, I'll wipe it down to get the excess water off then drape it somewhere to help speed the process along. That said, I've had to endure multiple nights of wet rain fly. I always stay dry in the tent."

CampingandHiking,3bn7mk,LingoFlamingo,10,Tue Jun 30 16:00:42 2015 UTC,"Hey, to totally come off as 'that guy', y'all don't sound like low impact backpacker types - and this sub is largely comprised of folks who are active and respectful wilderness users.  Soooo, the fact that you're getting roundly downvoted should be telling.  I really, really, recommend that you heed the advice of other posters and stay in an established campground - they're all over the place up there and could easily host a group of your size and potential impact. I say this not only for the reasons others have posted, but as a safety concern as well - a large group of college students mixing fire, cooking, and sharp objects with alcohol could be pretty dangerous in the backcountry - as a park ranger, this screams 'high risk group' to me.  Finally, if the UP's many campgrounds ultimately don't suit your needs, just call up a Forest Service ranger station for recommendations, and be honest with them - they by and large know their shit, and might have some good thoughts for campsites - and in case of emergency, they'll have an idea of where you're at."
CampingandHiking,3bn7mk,Bobby_Orrs_Knees,10,Wed Jul 1 00:16:41 2015 UTC,You probably aren't supposed to have a group that large no matter where you go.  Most places try to keep the groups smaller to have a lesser impact on the land.  Try breaking into smaller groups.  Fires are typically only allowed in designated camp grounds with permanent fire pits and all that.  If you are dispersed camping you shouldn't be having a fire especially for such a large group.
CampingandHiking,3bn7mk,ICanAlmostThink,4,Tue Jun 30 19:10:03 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure you aren't supposed to have that large of a group either. My university regularly takes large group of students for backpacking (Smoky Mountains and trails in North and South Carolina). We are required to split up into groups of no more than 8 and take different trails and routes to minimize our impact.
CampingandHiking,3bn7mk,ceanahikari,-4,Wed Jul 1 00:32:26 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere (can't find it now) that up to 75 people is okay, more than that you need written permission.  Edit: Found it, I guess it's the USDA, so I guess it doesn't apply to state lands."
CampingandHiking,3bn7mk,SoldierOnce,7,Tue Jun 30 19:18:49 2015 UTC,"R 299.927 Also states that it is unlawful to light a fire except in a designated area.     Generally speaking disperse campsites won't have established fire rings.  So, you might not need to plan for firewood."
CampingandHiking,3bn7mk,SoldierOnce,-2,Tue Jun 30 16:09:39 2015 UTC,"That does say state parks and recreation areas though, we won't be in a state park (unless state forests are state parks?). I would imagine fires are okay to build as long as you do it right, per the fire building tips page they provide, because how else would disperse campers cook food and actually, you know, camp and survive?"
CampingandHiking,3bn7mk,SoldierOnce,7,Tue Jun 30 16:16:22 2015 UTC,"Backpackers usually use a camping stove for cooking needs.   It's actually more efficient, less impactful and, in my opinion, easier, than using a wood fire for that purpose.     That said, it appears you are correct--- state forest areas might not have regulations against building fires.  This is a question I'd be very specific about asking the rangers on.    As for where people get firewood if they aren't allowed to use deadfall from the park: they carry it in from nearby suppliers.  Most of the time there will be rules about how far you are allowed to haul wood in a state and as a result, landowners near park entrances routinely have split firewood bundled for sale.   But hauling enough firewood for a day or 2 of dispersed camping including cooking needs seems like a fuckton of work.     I can be boiling water for coffee 3 minutes after I wake up with a white gas stove, rain or shine.   Having to build a fire to do that takes considerably longer and is more dependent on the weather."
CampingandHiking,3bn7mk,SoldierOnce,-3,Tue Jun 30 16:42:27 2015 UTC,"This is true, but I'm looking at it from a more traditional aspect. They still have to (should) the option to do it via traditional means, AKA a campfire. I shouldn't have to go have a gas stove, and all this ""fancy"" equipment to go live in the wilderness for a few days.  Just my opinion, I did ask them and I'll post the response when they get back to me in a day or so."
CampingandHiking,3bn7mk,SoldierOnce,7,Tue Jun 30 16:52:52 2015 UTC,"The problem with the 'traditional' method is that is about as far away form Leave No Trace as you can get, short of development.  The more that happens, the more impacted the environment will be.    Just the idea of 18 people going 'dispersed' camping is a little cringe worthy.   4 days of firewood, greywater, human waste and plain old stomping the ground is going to leave a mark.   And that much firewood is non-trivial.  You can carry enough fuel for cooking for 4 days in a one gallon container.   4 days of cooking woodfires for 18 people is a lot of material.   And if you have it for cooking you know you are going to want to have it burning at night 'for the experience'.   A fire big enough for 18 people to sit around and enjoy... that's a lot bigger than a cooking fire."
CampingandHiking,3bn7mk,PrincessHumperdink,0,Tue Jun 30 17:10:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to imply that we'd be using only fires to cook all our meals, but simply the idea of allowing campfires so people can do it.  For our trip I would want a campfire, just for the sake of a campfire, roast some s'mores, maybe cook some wieners. Obviously not for every meal on the trip.  I do agree with you though."
CampingandHiking,3bn7mk,SoldierOnce,3,Tue Jun 30 19:09:03 2015 UTC,There are places where campfires are allowed--- those designated areas.    I would not blame the state if they didn't allow fires outside those areas.   Dispersed camping rules typically require adherence to Leave No Trace principles and open fire pits don't lend themselves to that.  There are a lot of rather rugged designated camping areas in Michigan.   Have you considered just booking a hike in place in the Porcupine Mountains park or some other park area where you can be really secluded while still retaining some of the 'amenities' of a park (like a fire ring and a slit toilet)?
CampingandHiking,3bn7mk,SoldierOnce,-1,Tue Jun 30 19:22:02 2015 UTC,"I want to be clear, I don't plan on going up there and burning everything in sight, leaving a mess, and leaving.

CampingandHiking,3bi2kc,evandena,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:21:50 2015 UTC,Not sure how hard you push but if you apply for access from the Bad River Band tribal council you could hike the river from Mellen to lake superior. Other wise start in Mellen and hike to the NE corner of Copper falls. Next day turn east on the NCT there is a designated trail camp about 12 miles west of Upson lake.  You can hit the road again after the lake.

Show up at the back country office when they open (or 30 min early if you have something specific) the day before you want to start hiking, and the Rangers will hook you up with something.   Background: my husband and I got a backcountry permit for last year, but in mid-July, the pass was still impassable due to snow. We changed our permit and had a blast.   I would also recommend base camping at Many Glacier if possible. It is as crowded as the east side of the park, but the people are cool and there are a lot of long 10-20 mile hikes in the area.  Good luck!"

My favorite hike ever was the East Fork of the Quinault River Trail in Olympic National Park to the Enchanted Valley. It was an out-and-back hike that I did in three days / two nights. The trail follows a large river through some deep forest with massive trees and views of the surrounding mountains, and the enchanted valley has a bunch of big waterfalls and is really amazing. There's some good, flat campsites and lots of places to filter water along the trail. I also saw multiple bears and a herd of elk, among other wildlife."

Heel pain is usually associated with Plantar Fasciitis, though there's a chance it's a Heel Spur. Like I said, go to a doctor. Plantar Fasciitis is actually pretty common and Superfeet are the ONLY aftermarket insole certified by the American Podiatric Medical Association. With all that said, I'd try the Green Superfeet. They offer the most support in their line which is likely what would work best with heel pain... specifically Plantar Fasciitis.   Edit: Go to a fit shop that has them, they'll likely have samples to test them out in the store."

If I was a gambling man, I'd say 6am should be fine.  As an alernate plan, you could start at Rafferty Creek, heading toward Vogelsang High Sierra Camp and end up in the Valley. You begin and end in pretty much the same place as your original itinerary."
CampingandHiking,3bkvdb,neimad19,4,Tue Jun 30 01:26:49 2015 UTC,"Life straws are ok for emergencies, but I've heard they're not so great for normal use.  There's no need to go crazy with clothing unless it's weather specific. If you plan on going in decent weather, activewear from Target or Walmart will be fine.  Gatorade or Powerade bottles work just fine for carrying water, and weigh much less than Nalgeens."
CampingandHiking,3bkvdb,mrjowee,5,Tue Jun 30 01:39:41 2015 UTC,"I'd go with some headlamps rather than a torch/flashlight. You're probably going to be eating, cleaning dishes, getting ready for bed once it's dark and those are all things that more or less require both hands. Also, the cookware you've picked out doesn't look like it has lids. Lids definitely help when trying to get water to boil for cooking/drinking. It may not seem like a big deal but boiling water on a small camping stove takes longer than your typical kitchen stove-top and lids go a long way."
CampingandHiking,3bkvdb,lamic,2,Tue Jun 30 03:49:27 2015 UTC,I second the headlamp.  It's very versatile and a must have for hiking/camping.

CampingandHiking,3bkvdb,dangerousdave2244,3,Tue Jun 30 16:10:10 2015 UTC,"Life Straw is a total ripoff, not reliable over time, and you have to bend over the water source to drink, you can't fill up a water bottle. You can get a sawyer filter (which is also not super reliable over a long time, according to recent independent testing, but much more useful), or better yet, get a Katadyn Hiker filter. I have a Katadyn and it is awesome  Be careful with the chinese stoves, they tend to direct their flames in a direct stream like a rocket engine and will start warping, scorching or melting pots, especially aluminum ones."
CampingandHiking,3bkvdb,pyrofrenchie,2,Tue Jun 30 03:40:53 2015 UTC,"Compression bags are awesome for anything from sleeping bag to clothing. For the water, you can drink glacier water without any purification (best water I've ever tasted!) if you're above snow line or you can use aquatabs for water purification ( http://www.mec.ca/product/5030-822/aquatabs-water-purification-tablets-1l/?f=10 )"
CampingandHiking,3bkvdb,jeanabelle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:19:54 2015 UTC,The Life Straw isn't going to cut it. I have one and it's a fun idea but the water comes out of it sooo slowly that you'd never drink enough if you need to rely on it. If you don't want to shell out for a real filter (I'd recommend the platypus gravityworks filter) just use Aquatabs.   I second the comment about getting headlamps.  I have an MSR Superfly stove and I love it. It was about $60 but it is on it's 3rd summer (several long weekends use per summer) and it seems like it will last for 10 more years.   I also really like the Hennessey Hammock. I think the big ones can work for 2 people if you don't mind cuddling.

As far as hiking is concerned, this list of the top hikes in the park is a good starting point in trying to decide where to hike: http://www.tetonhikingtrails.com/grand-teton-top-10-hikes.htm  IMHO, Zion is far more scenic than Canyonlands, and it will be a little cooler. I thought Zion is a pretty cool place to do some hiking for 2 or 3 days, but I prefer the Tetons, or even Yellowstone over the desert - but that's just my preference."
CampingandHiking,3bk364,Huckleberry-Hiker,2,Mon Jun 29 21:45:51 2015 UTC,"I think Zion is the best NP in Utah.  Plus if you do the Narrows hike, the water will help with the heat :-)  It may be hard to get a campsite reservation, but there is a walk-in campground (if you can get there early in the morning to claim a spot).  Also check the online reservation system for Watchman campground several times a day because cancellations do come up (but get snatched up quick!).    It'll be hot, but worth it :-)  Just start your hikes as soon as the first shuttle starts running.  It'll be cooler and you'll miss the crowds (which can get bad at Zion)."
CampingandHiking,3bksh3,CptnChunk,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:02:45 2015 UTC,"So heres the thing. You might get some decent traction out of your Altras, and if you are used to hiking and backpacking in them, you might be ok. Since you like Zero drop and a wide toe, you definitely shouldn't be looking for classic european-style alpine boots right away, especially if you don't think you'll use them again. On the other hand, Half-Dome and other Yosemite hikes are no joke, and are incomparable to Florida hiking.   What you might like, and get some use out of, are approach shoes. Approach shoes are light hiking shoes or boots made specifically for use on rocks. The name comes from them being used for the approach up to rock climbs, which often involves scrambling up and down steep sections of trail or even light climbing. They aren't made to be heavy (neither are most hiking boots nowadays, but you dont need a backpacking boot for this), but what approach shoes DO have, that neither your Altras, the Salomon Speedcross, or other trail runners have, is some stiffness in the toe, and a stiffer shank, which is a near necessity when doing long, steep ascents. The Salomon speedcross is no more sturdy than your altras, just narrower, with a more exaggerated outsole (by the way, a super toothy outsole where the lugs are spaced far out like the Speedcross is NOT the best option for giant slabs of rock, it is made for dirt, gravel and mud).  The only issue you may run into with approach shoes is that some are a little narrow, much more so than Altras. So you may have to try on several pairs before you find the right one, and you may not find the best selection in local stores. All rock climbing brands (5.10, La Sportiva, Scarpa, Evolv etc) make approach shoes. 5.10 and La Sportiva I have the most experience with, and I like their stuff, I think you'd do fine with any of them. Other brands that make good approach shoes: Salewa, Lowa, HanWag. Some hiking shoes that might suffice as approach and hiking shoes for both Florida and Yosemite, and might fit you: Oboz Sawtooth Low (non bdry), Salewa Wildfire (not gtx) Salomon Eskape (though these are less sturdy than I'd recommend), Merrell Capra (the only Merrell that isnt a piece of junk these days, the Moab is a joke) or as a last resort the North Face Verto Approach.   If you insist on using a trail runner, Look at La Sportiva, or the Oboz Sundog. But your feet will thank you if you use a supportive hiking shoe or approach shoe rather than a trail runner, at least on ascents. On descents, trail runners can be great in terms of cushioning you as you go down, but you might lose traction, the last thing you want to do at a place like half dome. I have experimented and used hiking boots or approach shoes going up a mountain and trail runners going down, and it worked well on dirt paths, not as well on pure rock."
CampingandHiking,3bksh3,dangerousdave2244,2,Tue Jun 30 04:17:11 2015 UTC,A second question I meant to ask as well: will those ascent shoes work as hiking shoes for all throughout the park or just specifically for the climbs?
CampingandHiking,3bksh3,dangerousdave2244,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:35:43 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks, exactly the kind of insight I'm looking for. I didn't want it to sound like I'm not willing to put the money into the right kind of shoe for this trip, because I totally am.  I just have no idea with Yosemite kind of hiking and don't want to spend money if I didn't have to. I'll look around local stores and see if they have any approach shoes to try on and get a feel for, I do like the wide shoes so hopefully I can find some locally and break em in.  Thanks again for the advice!"
CampingandHiking,3bkrgb,Readysethorrible,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:54:23 2015 UTC,"/r/campinggear might be a good resource. I have lots of knowledge on hiking, backpacking, and caving packs, but SAR definitely has packs specifically made for it. There are lots of packs for medics.   However, since you mentioned elevated mesh, the only smallish (under 40 L) packs that I know of with elevated mesh (aka Trampoline mesh) are made by Osprey, and a few by Gregory. A few other manufacturers are starting to catch on and make them now, but Osprey and Gregory are still the big 2. The Gregory Z30 or Z40, the Osprey Stratos 36 or 50, Atmos AG 50, or Manta 36 (manta comes with a hydration pack) are great options. What capacity are you looking for? Are you carrying ropes? Then you might need 50-65 liters, rather than 35-50. The quality and durability of these packs are nice, and backed up by good warranties. HOWEVER, they are not especially tough packs, they arent as tough as a lot of ""tactical pack""s, or the kind of packs used by cavers. If you can find something made by say 5.11 tactical, that has the features you want, you might want to consider it too. Arc'teryx makes great packs, and has a military division, LEAF. Look for SAR specific packs online too."
CampingandHiking,3bkrgb,dangerousdave2244,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:57:48 2015 UTC,"Oh man, those Arc'teryx LEAF packs look like exactly what I need, but as much as I hate to admit it, they're quite a bit out of my price range :( That osprey Atmos AG 50 looks to be my best bet yet, though I'll definitely X-Post this the /r/campinggear for some more advice. Right now I'm not carrying ropes or extensive amounts of climbing gear, but once I take Tech rescue training courses, I expect to be carrying more, and same goes for E-care gear. I have considered some black diamond packs, but Black Diamond isn't too mature in the backpack business right now, so I'm probably going to stray away from them for the time being. May I ask what pack(s) you use personally?"
CampingandHiking,3bkrgb,curiousincident,2,Tue Jun 30 06:17:48 2015 UTC,"Just be aware that the Atmos AG 50 is at least 3 pounds heavier than the Flash you have. And like the poster above alluded to, its more of a backpacking pack than a technical pack."

CampingandHiking,3bjky9,freedomweasel,2,Mon Jun 29 20:56:36 2015 UTC,"It's a tough one,  not completely insane but what's your contingency plan if you can't make that time table?   You might want to make a plan that gives you a way to shorten your run without much trouble in the event that you find that you can't keep that pace.   It's relatively easy to make a hike take longer but it can be a lot harder to make a long hike take less time."

Whether or not you're physically capable of doing the hike is one thing, but being that far away from a bail if things go sideways on you just because it's your first time out is something else entirely. That said, I wouldn't say it's insane."
CampingandHiking,3bjky9,HeyRememberThatTime,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:41:02 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty reasonable. While starting long hikes, I keep my daily mileage under 15 miles per day to prevent knee/ankle/hip problems until a few weeks in when I feel my body getting stronger. Running is pretty good at strengthening these tendons. Go for a 15 mile walk around town and listen to how your body feels.  Even at 17 miles in a day, you'll still have plenty of time to enjoy nature.  As a backup plan, look at the map of the hike and identify the nearest road. If run into problems, just go to it and hitchhike to your car."

There are trail heads every 5-10 miles so I figure if I really can't handle it, I'll just take one of those cuts offs and inform them of the change.   I just wanted to float the idea of 17 mile days and see what a more experienced community thought about it.   Thanks!"
CampingandHiking,3bjky9,DSettahr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:12:30 2015 UTC,"Personally, if you're at all unsure... I'd go for the two 10 mile days and bring a good book just in case.  If you end up finishing the 10 miles early the afternoon with energy to spare, then you'll know for sure that you can do more on the next trip, and will feel much more confident about doing so.  If you try the two 17 mile days and end up miscalculating, though, you might find yourself in a bit of trouble.  A large part of hiking is gaining experience about your abilities (and your limits)."

Yeah sure that's doable. 17 and 10,000 feet of elevation change is going to be a feat.  Nevermind I just looked it up. Max elevation change looks to be 1200 feet. Total elevation change is something you've got me on, but from what I did see there's a lot of up & down there.   I'd say it's probably doable."

Enjoy the area and the facilities. When nightfall comes, drive just out of the park and camp in the national forest wherever suits your fancy. Completely free and legal."

I know some areas will allow you to pitch a tent on the side of the road or even sleep in your car.   I did a solo road trip through Oregon back in 2007 and slept in my car every night in the parking lots of hospitals and truck stops. Never had a problem. I had a cooler of food with me and only paid for gas and entrance fees to a few parks the entire trip.

CampingandHiking,3bhjhq,emilyjgee,2,Mon Jun 29 07:20:32 2015 UTC,"Best part about buying the correct size pack (congratulations on not making the newbie mistake of buying a 70L monstrosity) is that you wont be able to over pack. 55L will keep you to the essentials. Dont bring too many clothes, dont bring heavy food. With every item in your pack, think, ""Do I really need to bring this"" and ""Is there a lighter thing I could replace this with"". That outta get you going. Oh, and I bring pre cooked bacon to eat. Its super light, like 30 pieces weighs 2 oz. Combine this with a freeze dried scramble, a tortilla and some hot sauce, and you got yourself breakfast burritos that are super light."
CampingandHiking,3bhjhq,Almostcomatose,2,Mon Jun 29 16:09:05 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's some easy advice:  Warm weather?  Leave the heavy jacket and extra layers at home.  Just make sure your sleeping bag is warm (nights can get chilly).  You can get away with wearing the same pants/shorts for a few days. Pack an extra shirt and undies.   Your feet are important.  Use wool socks and pack extra pairs.  Hiking with wet feet sucks.  Throw some blister band aid packs into your first aid kit, you'll need them.   Don't rely too heavily on weather forecasts.  It can be very unpredictable in the mountains.  Pack a poncho and rain fly for your tent or hammock.  Better safe than sorry!  Canned food is heavy - look for freeze dried packs, jerky, oatmeal packs, rice, etc.  Trader Joe's has some decent all-in-one coffee/cream/sugar packs (just add hot water) and great trail mix selection.  Starbucks instant coffee packs are good too.     Sawyer water filters are the bomb.  Buy one.    BUG SPRAY.  100% DEET works the best.    Trail map  and detailed directions are a must.  Don't roll into the forest with sparse directions.  Trails are not always marked well (I learned my lesson on this one).  Also, for beginners, trails with plentiful water sources are probably a good idea.  Visit the local ranger station before venturing out, so they know you're out there."

You may want to consider an overnight first; it will give you a good idea of what you think you need but aren't using and what you didn't bring but actually want.
CampingandHiking,3bh5fg,Krilesh,9,Mon Jun 29 04:31:23 2015 UTC,"In general, there's backpacking, car camping, and hiking.  Hiking is just walking a trail for the day. Tons of fun.  Car camping is driving to established campsites, and setting up your tent and everything. Since most camp sites in parks have trails all around, a lot of people will hike from there. It's really only referred to as ""car"" camping because people tend to pile in the luxuries, since it's only 15 feet from the car to the site. Tons of fun, as well.  Backpacking is when you're carrying all of your gear with you. You hike into the campsite (established or otherwise), and then set up camp. Next day, pack up your gear, and hike back out or keep on going. Backpacking is anything from an overnight to a 3 week+ venture. Also tons of fun.  If you think you want to start backpacking, hiking and camping experience is good to have. You need to also build up the endurance to carry a pack, so if you want to start backpacking, some day hikes first are probably a good idea."

CampingandHiking,3bh5fg,condortheboss,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:53:17 2015 UTC,"Well my prior experience has mainly been hiking first, and then setting up camp for the night.  However that is because we hike and camp primarily outside of ""registered"" camp sites.  If you're going to a more official campground it can be perfectly normal to set up your tent in your registered spot and then go hiking."

And that would be half a day's drive at most?
CampingandHiking,3bh5fg,Wintersoulstice,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:55:41 2015 UTC,"In general you can do either of those, depending on where you are specifically. Around me (Oregon) there's campgrounds who's individual sites are a parking spot and a tent pad, with hiking trails accessed by walking to the other side of the camp ground. There's also trails (of various length) along which clearings have a fire pit and space to put a tent.  If you don't have much hiking/camping experience I would suggest some shorter trips to gather some experience."
CampingandHiking,3bh5fg,Afro_Samurai,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:22:28 2015 UTC,"Typically you carry the tent with you so you can camp each night along the way. There are trails that take days (or weeks, or months) to complete. These are sometimes different trails than your 'local hiking trails' although it's not uncommon for these trail systems to be interlinked. Day hikers may hike on shorter section of much longer trails, turning around when they are a few hours from their cars."

When there is a forest fire, they don't just fight the fire where it is.  They figure out where it is going and cut down trees and clear out brush where they expect it to be.    With the EAB they've reacted by not bothering to cut down trees till there's already an infestation.   At which point shits already fucked.     Firewood does contribute... but these campaigns won't do shit till states take this seriously."
CampingandHiking,3bdbu9,SoldierOnce,4,Mon Jun 29 01:11:55 2015 UTC,"Ok so we cut all the ash down around where EAB currently is. (Lets ignore the fact that this amounts to millions of trees, and is prohibitively expensive costing more than the entire DNR budget). So now we have this massive swath surrounding EAB preventing them expanding, this is obviously good. But campers just transported wood across it and brought EAB to the other side...great cutting down all those trees didn't stop it and EAB got across it anyway. Heck this is almost certainly how EAB got to Colorado. The plains are a massive area with no Ash, yet EAB still got across b/c someone moved wood. So cutting down all tree ash trees in their path to stop their expansion won't do crap if people keep transporting wood. Moving wood it's part of the issue. Period. And needs to be part of the solution.   Those firefighters clearing trees and brush to stop the fire works because there are jerks carrying burning logs across it to the other side making the clear cutting ineffective.    I work with EAB in Minnesota and your idea does have merit. If implemented perfectly it would work. But there is currently not the funding, time, and labor force needed to accomplish it, and even if there was people would keep fucking it up by transporting wood across the area we cleared.   Firewood is a HUGE issue because bit allows EAB to travel quickly and reach places it otherwise couldn't. It is an insanely easy thing to do, so yes it is a valid tool in fighting EAB."

Doing the other way only slows the spread and does nothing to stop it."

CampingandHiking,3bhd6g,wetphotos,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:59:51 2015 UTC,Do you need amenities? Because there are a TON of primitive car-camping spots along forest service roads that won't have many people (if any) and can be pretty close to some stellar hiking.
CampingandHiking,3bhd6g,iclimbthings,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:05:49 2015 UTC,"No amenities needed.  So if we picked a region and had some Forest Service sites in mind then we shouldn't be concerned about finding a spot? I'm envisioning spending a bunch of time driving around trying to find a place for my kid to sleep. I fully recognise those fears are probably unfounded, I'm just more cautious when the kiddo is involved!"

Do you have any big destinations in mind?"
CampingandHiking,3bgiux,macbrave76,2,Mon Jun 29 00:54:50 2015 UTC,Where did you start and which direction did you hike?  Did this trail last year but had to start at the historic house due to construction. Hiked clockwise around the lakes and hit every camp site within the first 5 miles or so.  Ended up doing the whole trail and riding home disappointed.
CampingandHiking,3bgiux,gamergc264,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:34:54 2015 UTC,"We started at noon at the first trailhead after entering the recreation area.  Hiked clockwise like you did.     Like you we saw several campsites along the east side of Lake Celina withing the first 5 miles, but only a couple after that.  We surmised that this was probably due to other hikers starting the trail on a Friday evening after work and stopping when it got dark. And maybe those same hikers didn't do the entire loop but used the connector trail in between the lakes.  Anyway, we camped after hiking about 5 hours at a really nice site on the southwest corner of Indian Lake.  The next morning we hiked north around the west side of the lake, completing the trail around 11am.  I recall only seeing one more established campsite during that stretch, about a mile north of where we camped. However we did see somebody camping  in a tarp or hammock on the north side of Indian lake.  He was up on a bluff right near the 'tick infested area' sign in my pictures.  It was off the trail a bit, but looked like an interesting site."
CampingandHiking,3bgiux,shaneisneato,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:28:18 2015 UTC,We did this trail last year. It was super hot but was pretty good.

CampingandHiking,3bh12e,cwcoleman,2,Mon Jun 29 04:23:25 2015 UTC,"These pots are uncoated and will cause food to stick unless you use lots of oil-which makes them hard to clean up especially when backpacking.  A coated pot/pan set will be a lot better in the long run especially if backpacking.  These are also pretty small and made from thin metal which heats unevenly, you really have to watch your temperature control or they'll burn your food.  They'll work but you can do a lot better for not much more cash.  source-many trips in Boy Scouts with kids whose parents bought them these mess kits in spite of my advice to get something else, preferably the GSI pots mentioned by /u/cwcoleman which only cost a few dollars more.

CampingandHiking,3bcwe1,PeedInFloorOnce,6,Sun Jun 28 05:08:21 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the head is the best way to tell, particularly if you aren't familiar with identifying snakes, because Nerodia (nonvenomous water snakes) can flatten their heads in a way that can make them appear similar to venomous snakes like the cottonmouth or copperhead. The eyes can be a good way to differentiate between Nerodia and Agkistrodon (cottonmouth and copperhead). Here's a convenient comparison of a copperhead and a water snake that shows the difference in the eyes. Here's a full body comparison (water snake on top, copperhead below) if you're interested."

You could do a leisurely pace of 3 miles, then 5, then another 3 out. Or a two day trip with 8 miles one day, and 3 miles out the next.  For longer ones, there's the I&M Canal trail that has several spots where hikers can stop and camp along the way - not the most scenic route, but you can make it quite a long hike if you'd like. Sand Ridge State Forest has a total of 44 miles of trails, and 12 backcountry campsites. Another option is you can start the Rock Island Trail at any number of spots along the way, hike in towards Alta, camp, and then hike back out, though as a rails-to-trails hike, I'm not sure how ideal that is for a summer hike at the moment. And lastly, you can consider some of the trails in Shawnee National Forest, but that's quite a ways from Chicago too.   There's at least two Chicago Meetup.com groups that are for backpacking hiking too, and both do trips quite frequently."

I'll give you a couple of the main reasons I love it and use it every time I'm outdoors:     Free. The free version has everything you need. Very little is held back. I used it for years before buying the paid version, and even then it was to support the devs. They're awesome constantly updating.  Offline maps. Save maps for offline use. GPS works without reception, so you can be in the middle of no where and still see exactly where you are at. It's great for safety and for finding trails and making sure you are still on track.  Track recording. I record all my hiking and backpacking trips so I can: see how far I went, where it was at, how long it took, load it up on Google earth to see it in a new way or scout new trails. I also save them so I can send the track to friends and they can do the same route or trip. You can upload them online and let other people explore the areas you've been or provide it as a safety net so they know they're going the right way!  Point recording. Save your favorite campsites or water sources or beautiful views, etc. One of my favorite things to do is save campsites so I can look at a map and see all the places I've stayed.  Geocaching. I use locus for geocaching and it's awesome. If you've never tried geocaching it is basically a ""treasure hunt"" using your phones gps. People hide containers and you try to find them. Some are very easy (under a rock) others ate very hard (tied to a strong under a river). Gives you something to do while camping our backpacking and they are EVERYWHERE.   I could go on and on. One last important feature for track recording is the ability to adjust how often it uses your gps. I'll set it to pull gps every 10 min and it has virtually no impact on battery life (even if hiking all day). Just put your phone in airplane mode and you're set."

I guess maybe I'm too used to trail runners now"
CampingandHiking,3bea4j,MotoFox,2,Sun Jun 28 16:17:02 2015 UTC,"Could you wear your boots and take a really lightweight pair of sandals to wear as camp shoes so your feet have a break from boots each day?  Also, what is your base weight for this trip? I feel like that has a lot to do with needing ankle support, with a heavier pack I would opt for more support.   Personally, I don't mind just wearing trail runners. I am leaving for a ~30 day section hike here in a few weeks and have no problem only taking my trail runners."

CampingandHiking,3beel6,rasta_bob_ian,2,Sun Jun 28 15:10:13 2015 UTC,WV and VA are both slated for bad weather. Those were our first two options and we were looking at possibly Pisgah in NC as well.

Last I saw, Pisgah mandated bear cans for backpackers due to the increased bear activity. It's not so much the extra couple of pounds as the trouble of fitting it somewhere. Sometimes I think car camping would be so much easier! :)"
CampingandHiking,3beel6,DSettahr,3,Sun Jun 28 17:43:59 2015 UTC,It is very much easier. But you also don't get the full experience. SO was preggo last time we went so car camping was the only type of camping for us lol
CampingandHiking,3beel6,DSettahr,3,Sun Jun 28 17:59:56 2015 UTC,"For me, car camping is nice because you can take all the things, but then I like the solitude backpacking brings and the views that are too far for a day hike. You're one up on me though, I wouldn't do anything pregnant that didn't involve air conditioning and a couch. ;)"
CampingandHiking,3bf5x4,TimSenese,2,Sun Jun 28 17:53:55 2015 UTC,"The Dunes is nice, and there is hiking there, but it tends to be quite crowded, so getting a spot might not be easy. A couple other options in the Chicago-ish area:   Potato Creek State Park near South Bend. I've not been there, and my understanding is there's a lot of RV's, but there's hiking / biking trails, and it's not far off if I-80 either. Kankakee River State Park. I've been there dozens of times; nice place. River is currently flooded, and the Potowatomi campground is presently closed for improvements, but Chippewa campground is open, and is about half RV's, half tent camping, and usually relatively quiet. Long 10+ miles long paved trail that can be hiked or biked that mostly hugs the river, but be sure to cross the road near the suspension bridge and walk north along the Rock Creek section. Prettier section of the park that usually has fewer people, and some places you can scramble down (carefully) to the creek - assuming it's not still flooded when you get there. Perhaps a bit more than 1/2 hour south of I-80, but if you take I-55 down and hop off south Wilmington and take Route 102 to Chippewa campground, you'll save time compared to taking I-57. Shabbona Lake State Park. ~30 minutes north of I-80 off I-39. Not been there yet myself either, but my friend recently went and said it's quite nice and has some good hiking trails.  Starved Rock State Park. 10 minutes off the highway. Busy campground (you could perhaps stay at Buffalo Rock SP, but those sites are primitive with no facilities at all), however, the hiking is probably some of the best in the state. If you're going there though, try to stop in the middle of the week; the park will be VERY busy on weekends with a lot more people. If you do stop here, be sure to hike at Matthiessen State Park 3 miles south down Route 178."

CampingandHiking,3bev4n,nadrojylloh,5,Sun Jun 28 16:15:28 2015 UTC,I have a 3 liter bladder that I think I have successfully drained once after a whole night back packs trip but knowing that I have more water then I need isn't a bad thing. Id say looking at a bigger bladder in case you decide to up your trek time and then just get a nice day pack. If you're just going out for a few hours then no need to fill the whole thing but it's nice to have when you need it.
CampingandHiking,3bev4n,live2last,3,Sun Jun 28 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"I've had experience with camelbak in the past. If I were you I would buy an osprey pack and bladder. If you already have a pack, then a bladder will be a good choice. The osprey bladders have a skeleton so when you drink the water your pack will still stay upright. The cap is also much easier to screw and unscrew."
CampingandHiking,3bev4n,yzerboy,2,Sun Jun 28 17:11:55 2015 UTC,"Seconding the Osprey pack and bladder. I bought the Syncro 10from REI on sale the other day and I already love it. I prefer Osprey's water bladder than Camelbak because I find the hard back makes it easier to put in/take out and the handle helps me when I'm filling it up. It also has a nifty magnet near the bite valve so you can stick it to your strap - makes it easier to find and grab. Awesome ventilation, plus it comes with a rain cover. I'm using it mainly for mountain biking, but it has plenty of storage for all you need on a day hike. My boyfriend also has the (Osprey Viper)[http://www.rei.com/product/847143/osprey-viper-9-hydration-pack-100-fl-oz], which is another great bag (this doesn't come with a rain cover, though). Camelbaks are good, but I would definitely suggest trying out the Ospreys."

It was more expensive than others on the market ($140 vs $85), but I think it's well worth the additional money.  I use mine for a day pack when hiking with my kids and it has plenty of space for all of our stuff."

CampingandHiking,3bdne2,mpr76,2,Sun Jun 28 05:52:07 2015 UTC,"My main concern would be how comfortable the Farpoint will be for extended hiking, as it's more of a travel pack - personally I would have went with a pack more geared towards hiking (such as the Aether or Volt) over the Farpoint. But it's what you've got and it seems to be doing the trick,  so....  As far as capacity,  you may be able to fit a compact stove and cooking system, ultralight tent and lightweight sleeping bag in a 40 liter,  although I'd recommend something 50+ for a trip as long as yours. You will probably find 40 liters is not near enough space, particularly if you don't have lightweight gear. The costs of buying lightweight everything vs. just buying a larger, more suitable pack will be enormous in my experience - you may be better off ditching the Farpoint for something else. As for the pack surviving the hike - the fabric is designed to survive airport baggage handlers, they're pretty bombproof. I'd be more surprised if it didn't make it.  This was pretty rambly,  but the tl; dr is this: It's doable, and the pack can be modified/will live, but I recommend a different pack."
CampingandHiking,3bdne2,groundbound_petunias,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:28:27 2015 UTC,"Cheers buddy. I got the pack initially as it is carry on size and a good name as well. I thought I'd be doing smaller hikes such as several days to a week initially and so opted for the Farpoint on that basis and it has proved good for that so far. As for clothing, most of it so far is lightweight as I have been in hot countries and I knew I'd be doing a mix of backpacking & hiking so it's mostly all hiking gear anyway.  I also plan on investing in a good quality lightweight tent as well as it will have to last and something I can take with me.   Cheers for the input, I know people in NZ so I think I could leave anything I don't need on the hike with them to pick up later and lighten the load a bit more."

The weather was absolutely beautiful despite all the rain we've had this year so I figured this week would be a perfect time to explore elk country! Took about 4 hours to get to the forest (from Pittsburgh) and about 2 hours to get to the campsite (hiking). I highly recommend this place."

CampingandHiking,3bbeqc,thefightforgood,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:49:56 2015 UTC,"We were out of the Green River trail head and did 5 days.  Bring your fishing pole, we were catching a lake trout every other cast out of one of the lakes (Granite Lake).  Mosquitos shouldn't be bad that time of year.  Don't try to cram in too much mileage, give yourself a day off to climb a peak or relax, that was the best part of our trip.  Can't wait to go back.    We originally wanted to go out of Elkhart and do the sky pilot loop with a day in Titcomb basin, but there was actually a ton of snow in May which made that loop impossible for us in June.  We had a great time out of Green River though.  Let me know if you have specific questions."

Being from Cleveland myself I had never been on top of a mountain before going down there. Something I highly recommend.  Manistee National forest in Michigan is pretty cool. I went to the Nordhouse dunes area which was very very secluded but pretty nice. We hiked pretty much all day for 3 days and saw 2 other people (outside the immediate campsite area). It looked like there was a lot of stuff to do at the Silver Lake sand dunes but we didn't make it there. Hocking Hills is about three hours away. It is also really cool but very crowded. Lots of families around there. We stayed at Hocking Hills State Park Campground which was right next to a lot of cool hikes.

I highly recommend them- you get what you pay for unlike other brands where you are definitely paying for the name. They have some backpacks that lean very much towards the urban/school/commuting environment and some that are good for multi-use. Check out their website under both the 'Outdoor' and 'Travel' sections.

It was 30 miles on the primitive dirt roads alone.   You can't see it but the Rio Grande was right behind the tent and surrounded our camp site on 3 sides.   Edit: Forgot to add that while in the park we saw Tarantulas, Mice, Mule Deer, Black Bear, and a large pack of Coyote that ran us into our car for the night, along with several avian species. It was much more wildlife than I was expecting to see."

So late at night we were in our sleeping bags all zipped in when we heard a VERY clear howling not far away. Then a few minutes later we heard it again but much closer, then a few seconds later a slightly louder howl came from a second location, then a third, fourth, and fifth howl followed. Each separated and coming from a different spot around our camp site. A single coyote doesn't bother me much but a pack of them, surrounding us in a location where it would take 4-5hrs of driving to get to the nearest building, much less cell phone reception, made us decide to venture in to the car for a short while.  I started the car, turned on the brights and drove toward where I heard the majority of them coming from, did a full 360 spin to shine my lights in all directions and then drove back. Never seeing a single coyote. Shortly there after the howling started back up so we decided just to finish the night in the fj since we had that option."

CampingandHiking,3bcax3,mrjowee,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:25:51 2015 UTC,They do to an extent. The Tan Route will go from Gatlinburg to Elkmont CG stoping at Sugarlands VC and Laurel Falls TH. It runs from June to October only. Cherokee Transit runs from Cherokee to Sugarlands VC and will stop at New Found Gap. I have used both and they are not bad. The Cherokee shuttle was $5 to get to the gap and the Tan Route is a couple of bucks. So you can use them in those very narrow specifics of the park. Other than these options you are best to have transportation. Especially if you are going really deep in the back country.

CampingandHiking,3b7tr7,carlew,2,Fri Jun 26 17:47:26 2015 UTC,Amazing pictures! Just wondering - why does it seem like everyone chooses the yellow/orange REI half dome tent?  Is there some advantage to that color or was that the only color available previously?
CampingandHiking,3b7tr7,pink_tea,2,Fri Jun 26 20:38:21 2015 UTC,"Never thoughts about it, but the backpacking tent we have (not REI Half Dome) is yellow and tan. Maybe those are the default colors as they're easier to spot from the air should there be an emergency?  Also, easier to see at night / low-light settings, probably more reflective, too, for head lamps and whatnot?"
CampingandHiking,3b7tr7,untaken-username,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:55:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks! And it does seem like it, but I honestly have no idea. I got that tent almost two years ago, but I do remember this color was cheaper than the others."

CampingandHiking,3bb5xy,CivilDiscussions,2,Sat Jun 27 15:28:12 2015 UTC,"These days it seems like most timberline boots are just for looks, I personally wouldn't buy them to hike in. I would look for a more lightweight, comfortable option. There is a saying that a pound of weight on your feet is equal to five pounds of weight in your pack.  As far as a shoe or boot that is more casual looking but would also be great for hiking I feel like Merrell usually has a few styles that look less like hiking or running shoes."
CampingandHiking,3bb5xy,MotoFox,2,Sat Jun 27 17:01:36 2015 UTC,"You can hike in whatever you are comfortable in.   I wear trail runners because I love that they are lightweight, but I have strong ankles and feet so I don't tend to roll them."

Buy peppermint oil/extract and before you head out on a hike, dip a few paper towels in a mixture of peppermint oil and water (a couple drops of peppermint oil per 8 oz of water). Then take the damp towels and put them in a plastic ziplock baggie. Tuck it away in your backpack and when you hit the summit (or you're just really, really hot) take out one of the towels and place it on the back of your neck. It's heavenly.   Cool, tingly, and smells delicious when you're hot, stinky, and sweaty."

CampingandHiking,3bb39l,Midnightlama,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:50:15 2015 UTC,"A cotton/poly blended shirt will keep you cooler and be more comfortable in high humidity than one made of full synthetic material. Cotton won't kill you when there's literally no chance of hypothermia.  A hammock is easier to stay cool in at night, and during the evening your tarp will keep the sun off if you while lounging.  Eat dinner early. Your body produces heat while it digests food, and you don't want that while sleeping.  Camp on top of a hill, if it's not going to cool off at night. Windward side is a good choice as well. The idea is to catch any breeze that might blow, rather than the mythological cool air that settles in valleys."
CampingandHiking,3bb39l,mrjowee,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:45:49 2015 UTC,Best thing I have bought is a wool shirt. The wool will wisp away your sweat keeping dry and wool is also a natural deodorizer. Icebreaker marino is a good brand to look for.

I'm not sure on the name of this lake but it is the first lake you pass when you go down the left trail of the western uplands. The first loop is a 3 day hike. It's pretty challenging but if you pace yourself you're in for a beautiful trip. The lake I stopped at is Eu lake since we didn't do the whole loop. We went in the spring and  weather was rough so we didn't push it ( we also only had two days off work).

CampingandHiking,3b7lp8,JSchecter11,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:45:10 2015 UTC,Each platform can fit 2 tents (average size 2+ person tents).  I would guess you will be able to get a spot.  A lot of people will probably stay in the hut anyway if there is room since it is a pretty nice hut.  If you head out in the morning you won't get to Imp too late and you should have no problem claiming a spot.
CampingandHiking,3b7lp8,JR005,2,Fri Jun 26 23:38:21 2015 UTC,There is the Liberty Hut or Camp Penacook if you want some bare bones shelter around Chocorua. There is tons of parking at the Champney Falls base.

I guess you should stay at Camp Rich instead which is later on the Rollins trail before Mt. Passaconaway and I believe they still have the outhouse there actually.  All the huts in this area were removed a long time ago, these are the names of the former huts FYI, it is tent camping only on the hardened areas.  I have never done this as a two day loop but it is a nice area for sure.  Any camping at either of my suggestions should follow wilderness low impact practices as they are considered wilderness camping and no longer hut areas."
CampingandHiking,3b7lp8,petecas,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:53:38 2015 UTC,"But it is acceptable to camp in these places as long as you follow LNT, etc? As a first-time backpacker, though I am prepared, I want to make sure I follow acceptable practices."
CampingandHiking,3b7lp8,jdmercredi,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:55:18 2015 UTC,"yes, they are trying to re-vegetate the Shehadi site, but there are hard packed areas to camp (allowed) still.  Rich is a good option as they are not changing that and it still has the outhouse, they just took down the huts from all those old places since they were just falling apart, camping is still allowed you just have to follow the LNT low impact practices.  Pitch on hard packed areas, don't make fire pits, pack-in-pack-out, etc.  Edit: http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5363715.pdf  Edit 2: I really think the sandwish range loop would be a great option using camp Rich"

Recently I bought a pair of Altra Superior 2's and took them to Glacier for some hiking/backpacking and LOVED them.  They got wet some (mostly dewy morning hiking), but dried out quickly.  For fording where the water is knee-waist high I brought a pair of water shoes and swapped them out, so I can't say how they would do once you fully submerge them.  That is another reason I would prefer trail runners though.  If you submerge waterproof boots the water will stay inside, if you submerge trail runners they will drain the water as you continue to hike."
CampingandHiking,3b7v2f,the_gv3,2,Fri Jun 26 18:54:10 2015 UTC,Love the Altra Superior 2. My favorite shoe EVER!
CampingandHiking,3b7v2f,Bad-Phish,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:29:39 2015 UTC,I'm loving it also!  So nice.
CampingandHiking,3b7v2f,the_gv3,3,Sat Jun 27 03:02:23 2015 UTC,"The reason AT and other long distance, thru-hikers prefer runners is because when you're taking magnitudes more steps small differences in weight add up quickly. Some people definitely do prefer them for shorter hikes however, it's just preference."
CampingandHiking,3b7v2f,gsf4lyfe,2,Fri Jun 26 18:02:19 2015 UTC,"I've never hiked the AT, but I've done several long distance day-hikes and shorter backpacking trips in trail running shoes.  I have hiking boots, but I find the rigidity of them to be uncomfortable.  I haven't worn my hiking boots a single time since I got my Salomon Speedcross shoes, and I'm now on my second pair of Speedcrosses.  I learned one thing the hard way, though, because I assumed that all Speedcross shoes were created equal.  I didn't know that the first pair that I bought was the GTX (for Gore-Tex) model, so I made the mistake of assuming that they're all Gore-Tex lined, and that is definitely NOT the case.  If you want them to be waterproof, be sure to go with the GTX model."
CampingandHiking,3b7v2f,sarowen,2,Fri Jun 26 18:28:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's helpful. I do prefer waterproof boots so these could be perfect. What kind of socks do you wear with them?"
CampingandHiking,3b7v2f,sarowen,3,Fri Jun 26 18:38:30 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  Another thing about the shoes -- I always size up a half size, and I think my husband does, too, though his aren't Speedcrosses (I don't remember what model they are).  I CANNOT STAND thick socks, so I typically look for light-to-mid-weight hiking socks.  I have a pair of Darn Tough socks and Smartwool socks, and I like them both.  I'm a runner, so I have a lot of running socks, too, and sometimes I hike in them; my favorite running socks to hike in are Balega's Hidden Comfort socks.     Darn Tough Light Quarter Socks SmartWool Ultra-Light Mini Socks REI Ultralight Merino Wool Socks Balega Hidden Comfort Socks - The only bad thing about hiking in these is that they're kind of low-cut for hiking socks, so little rocks and dirt tend to sneak into the back at the ankle."
CampingandHiking,3b7v2f,Bad-Phish,2,Fri Jun 26 18:47:39 2015 UTC,"Trail runners for most of my hiking, with the exception of true mountaineering settings. I wear a smartwool sock, no liner."
CampingandHiking,3b7v2f,211logos,3,Fri Jun 26 20:28:28 2015 UTC,"I agree. Light is great.  I don't think people need boots unless there are specific reasons for them. These would include lots of sucking mud, tons of scree, a need for the rigidity of sole for climbing, etc.  But running shoes, even trail running shoes, and hiking shoes, low cut, often differ considerably. If I'm on a lot of sharp pointy stuff, or tons of talus and VERY rocky terrain, I prefer hiking-oriented shoes with a stiffer sole or the pointy stuff hurts. I prefer the softer, lighter, more flexible soles for any long stuff with a lot of pounding.  Toe caps are nice too.  I've used GoreTex and other waterproof shoes and boots, and meh. For most everything I'd prefer something that drains and dries relatively fast. Boots don't, and I get wet from sweat in 'em anyway, but it's a necessary evil in snow, winter, climbing, etc. Even hiking in BC rainforest with stream crossing and whatnot I prefer shoes. With the weight savings I can carry more dry socks. While moving, it's no biggie if they get wet and I wade right through most stuff."
CampingandHiking,3b7v2f,Call1911,2,Fri Jun 26 21:47:05 2015 UTC,"Don't wear trail runners if your carrying over 35lbs over 4 miles.  I brought some as a back up, tried them out.  Ankle support isn't too crucial to me, however they don't have the support your feet need to carry weight long distances.  As far as a day hike goes, they're super light and comfortable."
CampingandHiking,3b7v2f,Brute1100,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:00:22 2015 UTC,I have had these for several years and a few hundred trail miles I would say they are great. The rubber still is in great shape and other than a tear here or there from wearing them day in and day out doing everything from grass cutting to hiking in Arkansas to construction they have been my favorite shoe ever. If they came in steel toe I would wear them to work and live in them then.

CampingandHiking,3b6zsq,sarowen,6,Fri Jun 26 14:04:26 2015 UTC,"most backpack manufacturers will tell you if you fall between sizes, pick the larger one. I'm guessing that Gregory pack has all the bells and whistles with a sternum strap and load lifters and stuff so you can make a slightly too big pack sit right on your back. A too small pack will always carry on your shoulders and there isn't much you can do to fix that."
CampingandHiking,3b6zsq,stmu07,3,Fri Jun 26 18:22:09 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I needed to know -- thank you!  I was trying to visualize what a too-short-torso would do, and I couldn't picture it in my head.  Now I get it -- if the torso is too short, the pack is forced to rest on your shoulders rather than letting your hips/back help support the pack.  Sizing up definitely makes sense!"
CampingandHiking,3b6zsq,MossBoss,3,Fri Jun 26 18:36:25 2015 UTC,"I know your question is about torso size but if I were you I would reconsider the capacity size. 65L is big. If you did fill it, you probably wouldn't want to carry that load for longer than a few miles. My fiancé  has an Osprey Aura 50 and it fits everything for a 3-4 trip no problem. I could be way off base and you could be doing a lot of winter, long treks. But something to consider. If you are going to order I would say go with the small size for a 60L pack, or a medium if you go with a 50L. Good luck."
CampingandHiking,3b6zsq,eyesontheskydotcom,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:38:16 2015 UTC,"You're right -- I am NOT doing any winter (I hate winter) hiking or super-long trips.    My husband and I went on our first backpacking trip last year and loved it.  My current pack is an older 65L REI pack, and it was not very comfortable during the trip even though I was wearing it correctly (I bought it to use on my first trip to Europe and had never gone hiking/backpacking with it).  I didn't really know it was uncomfortable until we were a few miles into the backpacking trip.  It was packed full during this trip (which we way overpacked for), and it weighed a little over 30 pounds, which was manageable.    Osprey does make a 55L Ariel bag, and Amazon has free return shipping on it, so I might order it to be able to visually see the capacity difference between it and the 65L.  55L may be adequate since we learned that we brought way too much stuff during our first trip...I'm hypoglycemic, so we packed way too much food out of concern for that.  We're going to make a conscious effort this time to be a little more conservative with how much food we bring (though not too conservative because passing out is bad).    Thanks for the advice!"
CampingandHiking,3b6zsq,curiousincident,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:55:43 2015 UTC,"To add to what MossBoss said, I think this also comes down to what people bring and how they pack. I went to a backpacking class, and they were saying, ""Get a 70L pack for 2-3 day trips"" and all I could think was, ""Crap, I already have a 40L pack!"" I asked about that, and they said, ""Well, you can always compress the pack down if you don't need that much space."" I asked that question here on reddit, and many people countered with ""Yes, but if you have that much space, you'll likely USE that much space!""  But, I could also fit everything I need for 3 days in a 40L pack, and I don't have ultra-lite / super-compressed things. So with a less bulky sleeping bag for somewhat warmer (non-winter) weather, and whatever other items you take, plus managing your food well, you may well indeed be able to go with a smaller pack. I later wound up also purchasing a Gregory 58L pack, and I can't imagine me needing anything larger for 3-season backpacking for 5 days or less at a time.  But, on the trip I went on in April, there was a guy who had 60 lbs worth of stuff on his back too... so, everyone's different. Just some food for thought as you choose. Hope you find a good pack for you!"

CampingandHiking,3b6zsq,beeequeue,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:20:50 2015 UTC,"I've thought about trying the Aura, but I'm afraid that the 50L might not be quite big enough.  I wish it was available in a 55L or 60L option."

You can make it longer by taking other trails that start off from Lonesome Lake like the Fish and Jimmy trail that leads to the AT, I believe, or go to the North Kinsman trail and loop back to Lonesome Lake. There are plenty of options once you get to Lonesome lake."

CampingandHiking,3b2wia,Westbrook000,2,Fri Jun 26 22:18:12 2015 UTC,The Lonesome Lake trail is such a great beginner's hike for people who want to get kids into hiking. It was my first serious hike in the Whites and it made me addicted...so much so I did the 48 4Kers.
CampingandHiking,3b2wia,ncfpoozer,5,Fri Jun 26 13:32:06 2015 UTC,"Ironically, that exact, specific platform has a lot of memories for me.   When I first moved to NH and immediately did a 5-day backpacking trip with AMC, I made my first friends after moving there. The last night we stayed at Lonesome Lake and I remember sitting at that dock for hours and laughing so hard my sides hurt.  Eventually I also took a group of teens backpacking for an outdoor education program I worked at. We stayed our final night of backpacking at Lonesome Lake. We laid on that platform and I read aloud from ""A Walk in the Woods,"" the chapter where Bryson walks Franconia Ridge. And we looked up and followed on the ridgeline where he was at different points in the chapter.  Finally, I remember staying at Lonesome Lake one night and taking my sleeping bag and pad down to that platform, right where your husband is sitting. I fell asleep next to the lake. Then in the middle of the night: ""BANG!"" A bolt of lightning struck on the other side of the lake and was so loud it hurt my ears. I bolted up the steps to the bunkhouses and got inside as quickly as possible.  Thanks for bringing back all these memories!"

I decided to cough up the money for the excalibur, but then realized i would have nowhere ti put it. So that project may have to wait for another lifetime."

It's not hard to make your own dehydrated meals, you just need a dehydrator and be willing to experiment a little.  For recipes, I just try to recreate some of the simpler meals I might make at home, but in dehydrated form.  I've also found that it works well to combine store-bought dehydrated ingredients with ingredients that I dehydrate myself in order to produce each final meal."

CampingandHiking,3b6u0q,cmthomas78,2,Fri Jun 26 14:22:31 2015 UTC,Soo a water bottle?
CampingandHiking,3b32tg,Fameiscomin,2,Thu Jun 25 15:57:12 2015 UTC,Where are you headed?      Do you each need a filter? Also - those mini's come with a really small squeeze bladder - I always suggest to get a liter size bag so you don't have to scoop as much from the water source.       Do you have a list? It's hard to tell what is in the bags (low rez image doesn't help either)
CampingandHiking,3b32tg,cwcoleman,2,Thu Jun 25 18:39:18 2015 UTC,"After spending a weekend filtering liters of water for myself and my SO with a mini, I can totally understand why they have two. It seemed like, on rest breaks, I spent more time squeezing the bag than I did eating or enjoying where I was."
CampingandHiking,3b32tg,MotoFox,3,Thu Jun 25 19:15:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I suggest getting a bigger bag. If you have a 1.0L or 1.5L dirty bag you can squeeze more/faster between refills. It really makes filter time more efficient.      I'd also recommend upgrading to the Sawyer Squeeze (over the Mini). It has a higher flow rate for a slighter larger form. Worth it if you don't like the mini's performance.      Or even better - put the filter in-line with a hydration bladder. Spliced into the drinking tube - you barely know the filter is there. Just scoop dirty water into your bag and go. Downside here is that you don't have clean water for cooking - but boiling, chemicals, or a second filter could solve that problem."
CampingandHiking,3b32tg,cwcoleman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:22:15 2015 UTC,You could still use the filter with a Sawyer bag for filtering water for dinner.
CampingandHiking,3b32tg,huffalump1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:10:30 2015 UTC,huh? If you put the filter in-line - there is no Sawyer bag. You can't use an in-line filter to create clean water that doesn't go directly into your mouth. The sucking action is what replaces the 'squeeze'. Unfortunately it doesn't work by squeezing your bladder - at least on my setup (the connection isn't strong enough and it just seems to do more damage than it produces clean water).         Or do you mean to take the in-line filter out of in-line mode and use it with a Sawyer bag for dinner time? That is also a PITA. Getting the filter in-line is a delicate process and taking it out each night just isn't feasible for most.      Or did I miss your point completely?
CampingandHiking,3b32tg,cwcoleman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:38:01 2015 UTC,"I mean bring the separate bag and take the filter out every night. Not the most convenient, I know."
CampingandHiking,3b32tg,huffalump1,2,Fri Jun 26 20:45:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's an option. I went through so much pain to get that filter in-line, I'm never taking it out. Even now I'm worried it will slip out while in my backpack and dump my whole bladder on my gear.      I actually went as far as buying a second tube from Platypus for this reason. Since I also go on winter trips where I can't use the Sawyer - I replace the whole tube so I don't have to try and take the in-line filter out for the season. Sounds crazy, but it made my life way easier! It does complicate flushing the filter clean though...           Actually - the way I handle this is nice because I hike with my GF. One of us has the bladder with the in-line filter, the other does not. So we carry 2 filters. 1 in-line and 1 stand-alone + evernew dirty bag. Saves us time from having to filter 1 big bladder (because it filters in real-time), plus we have a filter for cooking or the dog if for some odd chance we want to filter her water."

CampingandHiking,3b32tg,MotoFox,2,Thu Jun 25 23:17:51 2015 UTC,We pretty much always have mountain streams flowing or clear lakes.  It a bonus of living in Colorado.  If you have to deal with all that gross stuff then a filter would be better

I got a bottle of Mirazyme, dunked and dried the whole thing two times (first time didn't rid the smell completely), and now it's totally fine. Mildew stains are still there, but the tent is great now - no smell, just a few small mildew stains on the inside no one will see but me and my family anyway. For 1/3 the price + 1 bottle of Mirazyme? That worked pretty well.   Hopefully that will save your tent for you too. You'll just have to put up with the stains."

CampingandHiking,3b3mjm,Huckleberry-Hiker,2,Thu Jun 25 21:11:41 2015 UTC,Cascade Canyon isn't really bad - most of the climbing - not much - occurs in the 1st mile or so. After that it's pretty easy. You can go as far as you want before turning around. It's widely touted as one of the best hikes in the national park system.  Static Peak Divide on the other hand is one of the most strenuous hikes I've ever been on. The rewards are pretty awesome though.
CampingandHiking,3b3mjm,nomansslave,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:21:12 2015 UTC,"Some copytpasta I wrote from another thread  GTNP Day trips   Hanging Canyon/Lake of the Crags with option to summit the Jaw- Park at string lake and start walking around toward jenny lake. crux is finding the faint climbers trail that branches right off the main trail on the lower slopes of mount st. john- Entance is surround by a rock circle. If you get to the boat ramp you've gone too far. Awesome waterfalls and views up there. The jaw is the summit at the very back of the lake of the crags cirque. Safe and easy scrambling to the summit.  Disappointment Peak, lake ledges or SE ridge route- More impressive of a summit than the Jaw, and right next to the east face of the Grand. Start from lupine meadows. Write down the description in the ortenburger guide book or I'm sure there's plenty of info online- Easy scrambling to the summit but route finding is important. Honestly this is probably easier of a day than the Jaw since the trail up hanging canyon is pretty steep and strenuous. You can link this with delta lake (pictured). From delta lake climb the obvious ~300ft couloir on the south side of the lake (starts @ lake) and from the top, you're right at surprise lake and on disappointment peak.  Garnet Canyon- Easy hike from lupine meadows puts you in the meadows. walk up to the lower saddle of the grand if you're feeling adventurous.     Multi- Day   cascade canyon to paintbrush canyon- overnighter @ under 18 miles death canyon to cascade canyon- 2 nights @ 30 mi Buck mountain, East ridge- 1 night, camp at timberline lake right at the base of the upper mountain (awesome spot). Get up early and climb the east ridge. Descend east face. This is only 3rd to 4th class but it is a knife edge in some spots and fairly exposed. Not unreasonable at all for someone do to without technical climbing experience but be aware of consequences. Very much worth it. You will probably have the whole cirque to yourself. Read the guidebook.    Rest Day-   Tube flat creek- goes through town, very mellow, can rent tubes a lot of places. Tube the snake river- South Park to Astoria Hot springs Huckleberry Hot Springs- awesome natural pool hot springs less than a mile from flagg ranch near YNP border. Pretty under the radar.   not to state the obvious but-  GET A GOOD TOPO. Start EARLY. Route finding can be difficult, afternoon thunderstorms are common, and its easy to over-estimate how long it will take you to complete something. Always bring a headlamp, emergency bivy, etc for day hikes.  If you are dirtbagging it in Jackson theres free to cheap camping up Curtis canyon above the elk refuge. Free camping along ditch creek road/shadow mountain as well. You need a backcountry permit to camp in the park. Rangers seem pretty chill with sleeping in your car at trailheads if you're in late and out early."

CampingandHiking,3b47s2,blorgensplor,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:53:59 2015 UTC,"My lab/hound mix eats more on the trail than at home by a good margin.  The first few trips, definitely pack more food for food for him than you expect him to need until you can dial in on his needs.  As seasons and even elevations (so exertion) change, it starts all over again.  It really can take a good while to sort out the dietary needs.  Regarding the tent, that gets tricky.  I know a lot of people that have mentioned how their dogs will move around all night at home, but will crawl their way into the tightest places while camping, as in they won't care or recognize that the tent is ""2 person"".  FWIW, my wife and I (and dog) mostly use the larger end of so-called ""3-person"" tents anymore.    If you can do a sort of extended day hike prior to hitting the backpacking trails, he'll probably give you a good idea of what some of his suddenly ""new"" needs are.    I wish I could offer more, but there really isn't a consistent right or wrong answer to so much regarding backpacking with dogs."
CampingandHiking,3b47s2,retreadz,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:06:42 2015 UTC,"I can't help too much seeing as my dog sleeps in the tent (she's quite needy).   The advice that I can offer would be to avoid being too close to streams, seeing as your latching the pooch outside you'll want to avoid bear and coyote paths as much as possible. Also in your case it sounds as if clearing the ground or avoiding an area with many downed tree limbs would probably be best. Lastly ensure you half a strong cable and good collar/harness for tying up your dog!  Have fun though! My Lab has gone on 4 trips with me, while she can be a pain at times on the trail overall I love having her along."
CampingandHiking,3b47s2,Progge,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:15:35 2015 UTC,One thing I've learned is how sensitive the pack is (at least his pack) to slight imbalances in weight.  The trick for me is to have enough small things in his pack that I can move from side to side for the first 20 minutes or so of each day to adjust the balance.  I've also tried to weigh out everything on a foodscale in advance but that didn't work - its not that each side needs to be the same weight but rather that after whatever straps or whatnot are tugging that the weight in each side compensates properly.
CampingandHiking,3b47s2,BigSpooky,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:29:50 2015 UTC,"I backpack with my Husky/Shepard mix regularly, although she doesn't have the tent or stick problems.      The dog sleeps in our 3 person tent with no problem. When we zip the door closed, she knows it is time for bed and sleeps nearly perfectly until we wake up (although sometimes she wants to 'pee', ie. hunt, 2-3 times a night - especially the first night out).        We do tie up a run for her often. Mainly when other campers are around and we don't want her to explore, especially past dark. Just tie a durable rope between 2 trees. Then clip the leash to the run and the dog. Ideal because they don't get tangled. The problem is that if they see something they want they can break out of the leash/collar/run.        My best advice is just to get out and try. Go for short adventures to start, and move up to multi-nights with more miles. You'll learn what the dog can handle, hopefully without too many hurdles.        Otherwise - leaving the dog at home is honestly a real option. You have some big battles to fight - it may not be worth it to have the dog for the potential damage it can do to itself and your gear. If it broke free from the run at night you could be in a shitty situation, that would be one of my biggest concerns. I'd sleep better knowing the dog is at home with a sitter and I'm fully enjoying my wilderness adventure."
CampingandHiking,3b47s2,cwcoleman,2,Fri Jun 26 02:45:46 2015 UTC,"What a great idea!  My Vizsla-girl does okay off of her leash, but she tends to visit other people (which is annoying), and we don't like for her to disturb others.  We normally tie her leash to something, but then she cries (which is also annoying) because that doesn't give her much space to roam.  We always have rope with us, so we'll have to start setting up a run for her as you described."

Education based degrees are also terrific.   Most of my below rambling might depend on where you live.   To become a Raft Guide you just have to get into the training in early spring and be liked. To become a kayak guide, same thing, get really good and apply to work at different businesses that already have permits to guide on different rivers. Getting a business permit for a river is near impossible these days due to manifest destiny. Most you will probably do as a Kayak instructor is Level 01 training, especially when starting off.   Guides make HORRIBLE money, but we love what we do so most folk put up with it.  To become a ranger for the NPS, USFS, etc you either need a BS and veteran points, or a Masters degree. It's highly competitive.   You could look into being an AMGA guide.   One may find it impossible to build something. Best to work for someone else and work your way up there ladder.   You can also go take this class to work for NOLS. Or figure something out for similar companies like AERIE or Outward Bound."

The boat returned to shore, picked up several more people, and then returned to circle the moose again, preventing it from swimming to shore.  Matthew Weiers then jumped out of the boat and onto the back of the swimming moose.

CampingandHiking,3ayyym,DSettahr,14,Wed Jun 24 18:18:37 2015 UTC,"Graduate student in the field of Recreation Resources Management here.  The problem with harassing wildlife is that it can have consequences (for the wildlife) that many people don't even realize.  Wild animals operate on an energy budget.  Remember that unlike humans, wildlife don't always know for sure where their next meal is coming from.  Consequently, energy isn't exactly something that they can afford to expend in excess, for example in situations where animals are fleeing pursuing humans.    The book Wilderness Management, by Dawson and Hendee, cites some interesting studies on the subject.  Of particular note is that possible consequences of wildlife fleeing human encounters has been shown to include both drowning and miscarriage.    I'm sure that someone will point out ""but humans are allowed to hunt.""  Hunting is also a carefully regulated activity, with regulations based on pretty a solid scientific understanding of the population dynamics and biology of game species."

And the reason it is cruel is that that moose assumes they are there to kill it.  It's like kneeling someone down in front of a ditch, putting an empty gun to their head, and pulling the trigger.  The person does not know that they are going to live.  This stuff is pretty common knowledge,  and pretty ingrained in the leave-no-trace philosophy, as well as park laws.  Do you really not know this?  Really?  Regarding hunting, every state I've hunted in requires you to kill the animal as quickly as possible.  The same for the food industry. Is killing any animal ethical? Who knows. But it can be done as ethically and in the least cruel manner possible."

This can weaken its condition making it more susceptible to other predators, etc.  This is why park rules say that if you caused it to move, you are too close.  Also, ask people who have been chased and accosted, but not physically assaulted, whether they suffered undue stress and trauma.  Having to run for your life is enough to give people PTSD.  Why would it be any different in animals?  And in this case, the animal actually WAS physically assaulted.   Believe what you want.  But park rules were not invented for no reason."

Your rationale is flawless.  Your understanding of cruelty is without compare because you know that only physical suffering is real suffering, and certainly not cruelty."
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,irishjihad,-19,Thu Jun 25 19:37:09 2015 UTC,You've never had someone jump on your back in a pool? I have and didn't consider it cruel. Hell I can't swim and have been shoved into the deep end. That's not cruel that's being a jackass and also not relevant to what we're talking about. I don't think  the moose being wild adds anything to the argument and using the word attack I think is just as knee-jerk as saying this is cruelty.
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,wtf_is_karma,14,Wed Jun 24 20:11:02 2015 UTC,"Have friends done it? Sure.  Has a group of complete strangers chased me and done it? No.  Would that be considered assault and battery? Yes.  Would I maybe fear for me life? Yes.    The moose wasn't hanging out with these guys, having a few beers, and realizing they are just a few idiots.  That moose was thinking it was going to be killed.  if you don't consider that cruel, I would say you're a bit unempathetic at best, and a bit sociopathic at worst.  There is no comparison between pushing your buddy in a pool, and chasing an animal with a boat, and then attacking it.  But hey, I guess I shouldn't be surprised by anything on the internet.  But I expected a bit more from a camping and hiking subreddit."
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,irishjihad,-5,Wed Jun 24 20:38:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not defending what they did. It was stupid and they deserved to get fined for it. But I will maintain that this is not cruelty. Nearly all non-predatory animals think they are going to be killed when confronted with something they don't know, that's why they run in the first place. And once again attacking implies that they meant to harm that moose which I don't think they did."
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,wtf_is_karma,7,Wed Jun 24 21:00:38 2015 UTC,"If a stranger chased you and jumped on you, you wouldn't consider that being attacked?  Do you really think the moose knew they were just joking and meant no harm?  U.S. National park policy reads:  ""If you cause an animal to move, you are too close! It is illegal to willfully remain near or approach wildlife, including birds, within ANY distance that disturbs or displaces the animal."" [Emphasis in original]  Most state park systems have similar policies.  Just because they ""meant no harm"" doesn't mean they didn't do harm.  A drunk driver who kills someone rarely means to harm anyone.  They're still liable."
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,irishjihad,0,Wed Jun 24 21:07:10 2015 UTC,"Comparing me to a moose is a false equivalence. If someone the 1/5 my size chased me down in water shoulder deep and jumped on me and didn't hurt me I would have to say that no I wouldn't consider myself attacked. Then again I'm not prey in my natural environment. Also, illegality does not equal cruelty and I never said they weren't liable for their actions. And from what I saw in the video, not only did they mean no harm, it looks like they didn't do any harm. They're still douchebags and if that guy were to have gotten seriously injured fucking with that moose I wouldn't feel the least bit bad for him."
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,yamiyam,3,Wed Jun 24 21:51:50 2015 UTC,"There was more than just one guy, and they were in a boat larger than the moose.  Ask a woman who has been accosted, not even raped, whether they felt violated, threatened, etc.  Moose don't usually understand human language or joking tones.  They chased it sown, harassed it, and physically attacked it.  As for the legality, most places in the U.S. and Canada would indeed consider this illegal. Being stupid is not a defense.  If you think it's okay to harass animals like this, and see fit to defend these guys and say it's not cruel, that's great.  You're entitled to your opinion. Band my opinion of you would be that you're no better than these guys."
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,wtf_is_karma,-1,Thu Jun 25 03:27:57 2015 UTC,"In the video one guy jumped on the moose. Once again you're trying to make your argument by trying to equate it to something completely different. And I'm not defending them as I've said countless times before I'm only saying something that's fucked up doesn't automatically make it cruel. As far as your opinion of me, you can think that I bury animals neck deep in the dirt and run them over with a lawnmower if it'll make you feel better."
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,yamiyam,3,Thu Jun 25 03:46:03 2015 UTC,One guy jumped on him.  But there was a boat full of guys chasing it.
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,wtf_is_karma,8,Thu Jun 25 03:48:19 2015 UTC,"Wild animals are not human playthings. Cruelty is a spectrum, and while this isn't the MOST cruel thing, it is certainly causing undue stress, which I would say is cruel. And yes, if we consider this cruelty then there are many other aspects of our civilisation which should be questioned, but our collective cognitive dissonance is not the issue of this post. You're also basically saying, ""as long as there are other bad things in the world, what's the point of discussing or solving other less bad things?"", which is ridiculous."
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,rideweedsmokebikes,8,Wed Jun 24 21:09:15 2015 UTC,I never said wild animals are human playthings. And if undue stress is cruel then every living thing on this planet lives a cruel life and I can't believe that. Every time you spook a deer you are causing it undue stress. I said what I said and you take it how you take it but there's actual animal cruelty I think needs to be addressed.
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,Brisco1,3,Wed Jun 24 22:09:52 2015 UTC,"Right, but by squabbling over the semantics of whether this is ""cruel"" or not you're normalizing the behaviour and detracting from the point if the post, which is to raise awareness of the fact that humans have a responsibility to act with respect towards wild animals.   And I'm assuming you can see the difference between actively chasing down a wild animal and happening to spook a deer while walking on a trail..."
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,wtf_is_karma,2,Thu Jun 25 00:30:23 2015 UTC,Normalizing? It's one incident of a jackass jumping on a moose you act like this is going to become some thing. All I was saying is that something can be fucked up and not cruel.
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,mcopper89,2,Thu Jun 25 01:48:24 2015 UTC,"I fully agree. Riding a moose is a jackass move, but there are certainly more heinous things going on every day."
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,SoldierOnce,4,Thu Jun 25 14:42:09 2015 UTC,"I kinda agree, cruelty is going a bit too far. It was a ballsy stunt that did no more than upset the animal (animals also get upset when their hurt, attacked, starving, or hunted by predators in the wild).  Not saying these guys shouldn't get fat fines for being jackasses though, we can't have crazy assholes doing whatever they please to the wildlife without repercussions."
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,mcopper89,-1,Wed Jun 24 18:36:43 2015 UTC,"I agree they should be fined but not the $100,000-200,000 the article talks about. It is definitely jackass behavior that should be reprimanded but cruelty is too knee-jerk in my opinion."
CampingandHiking,3ayyym,SoldierOnce,-4,Wed Jun 24 19:15:25 2015 UTC,For a small fee you can literally hunt a moose. You want to ride one and suddenly you are scum. That is pretty high up on the list of dumbest things I have ever heard.

Or the death that comes because we didn't hunt down the herd and they starve to death?  You are trying to make it sound like this harassment is completely without consequence to the animal, which either means you are ignorant or you are being disingenuous."

I'm not saying that the ethics are changed by ""monetization,"" but am replying to the question you asked about chasing wildebeests with a helicopter for a nature show.

Also, the very concept of cruelty is our own construct as humans, so of course when we try to apply some definition of such to anything else a certain leap has to be made.

We went in on the Lee Ridge Trail and left on the Chief Mountain Trail.  When we went a lot was still closed or covered in snow, so we were fairly limited, but now it should be more open and you could probably get in a sweet backpacking trip.  Additionally, we did plenty of day hikes before and after our backpacking excursion, and even the day hikes offer unreal views and photo opportunities.  The biggest advice I can give is to try not to see it all while you're there.  Pick an area or two and really explore those, then plan on coming back later on!  There is just too much to see to do it all in one trip and you will end up spread thin if you try to do it all."

CampingandHiking,3ay3sv,cathole,7,Thu Jun 25 18:12:21 2015 UTC,"This is perhaps an unpopular opinon, but the gentleman at REI who tried to convince you to buy boots was absolutely correct, and the people in this thread who say otherwise are giving you irresponsible and dangerous advice.  You stated that you don't have much experience backpacking. Here's something that you'll hopefully avoid discovering first-hand: NOTHING will ruin a trip faster than feet problems. Since you don't have enough miles under your belt to know what kind of footwear works best for you, the safe bet is a sturdy waterproof boot. Especially for an extended trip with a heavy (50lb+) pack.  Sweaty feet are not the same as trudging forward in waterlogged tennis shoes or, god forbid, freezing cold and soaked thru trail runners after walking through a patch of early season snow (which you'll probably find on some of the higher, less exposed parts of the trail). More importantly, if you're ankles aren't conditioned for broken terrain, your risking serious injury. I've rolled an ankle in a boot while carrying a 45lb pack. I don't want to think about what would have happened without that arch support (or trekking poles).  Just bite the bullet and get a pair of decent boots. Ask the associate how to lace them and wear them all month. If you can, go on a day hike or two with as much elevation change as possible so you can break them in and identify any hotspots.  This would be a terrible trip to find out you're trail feet don't like running shoes."

CampingandHiking,3ay3sv,joejance,0,Wed Jun 24 16:46:27 2015 UTC,It is a little more then just a preference IF you might be hiking on a trail with lots of large stones.  You can turn your ankle pretty easy if you do not have a high top.

CampingandHiking,3ay3sv,freedomweasel,8,Wed Jun 24 21:45:01 2015 UTC,"If anyone tells you that ""trail runners is all you need"" or ""you have to get good hiking boots"" then they are probably wrong.  Is that person your same height, weight, and gender as you?  Are they in the same shape as you?  Or they doing the same mileage you do a day?  Are they the same age?  Are they carrying the same load in their bag?  Probably not.  I will tell you that personally I enjoy trail running shoes for trail running, and hiking boots for hiking.  The reason for this is that on hikes I prefer a bit more ankle support when carrying a backpack and the ability to put my pants down past my boot tops to protect against poison ivy and in some places ticks (by tucking pants into socks).  However good trail shoes offer you many of the advantages that good boots offer.  A good shoe or boot probably offers a stiffer sole with a plate to help protect your feet, and might offer good water protection and is breathable.  Lightweight shoes and boots also save you a lot of effort.  With either one you should get it them now and start breaking them in.  If your choice is uncomfortable you probably don't want to find out on the trail.  Edit: Forgive me if I sound to preachy.  More than anything go have fun :-)"

I think it would be a good choice if you like a shoe with a bit more structure."
CampingandHiking,3ay3sv,yamiyam,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:29:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the only difference seems to be a couple mm of EVA.  Was mostly wondering how much difference it made.  My current shoe looks to be more like the Superior, and no issues so far though."
CampingandHiking,3ay3sv,the_gv3,3,Wed Jun 24 18:56:31 2015 UTC,Big difference between trail runners and tennis shoes and skate shoes and normal running shoes. I did a long hike in normal running shoes and was cursing myself after the first 15K. Trail runners usually have a stiffer outsole and you won't feel quite as much of the terrain on your feet. Best way to test your tolerance is to hike in them though. Keep in mind that hiking rough terrain and a long walk on asphalt aren't going to have the same effect.
CampingandHiking,3ay3sv,R_B_Kazenzakis,4,Wed Jun 24 17:58:48 2015 UTC,"The thing about running shoes is that they won't protect your toes or the soles of your feet. So in rough terrain, trail shoes (which can be just as light and agile as runners) might be more comfortable than running shoes."
CampingandHiking,3ay3sv,llammacheese,3,Wed Jun 24 17:37:18 2015 UTC,"Couple things: Do you carry a heavy pack? You'll want the ankle support if you do. Do you tend to role your ankles on the trail?

CampingandHiking,3ay3sv,Risoedus,5,Wed Jun 24 16:59:32 2015 UTC,"It may sound strange, but switching to lighter shoes made me less likely to roll an ankle.  In big clunky boots, my feet are dumb and I'm way more apt to mis-place a foot.  YMMV and all that, of course."
CampingandHiking,3ay3sv,crmacjr,2,Wed Jun 24 19:52:15 2015 UTC,"IMO it will depend on the trail and weather conditions. If I was doing anything over a day I'd wear boots with ankle support - ankles getting rolled is not a fun time in the wilderness. Same thing if you anticipate wet/muddy/slippery or unstable ground. A decent pair of boots with hiking socks will be more comfortable every time.   On the other hand if the trail is dry and decently maintained then you should be fine with runners.   Ive never had an issue with having to break in boots, last pair all I did was walk around my block a couple times before doing a 3 day 30km trip, no issues. Just don't get the super heavy duty boots that are meant for months-long trips."

CampingandHiking,3ay3sv,xkillx,-1,Thu Jun 25 03:16:55 2015 UTC,A good pair of trail runners is all you need- preferably a pair with Gortex water proofing. I've never gone back to hiking boots after buying a pair of North Face trail runners off of Steep and Cheap several years ago.

CampingandHiking,3aumt6,el_canelo,6,Wed Jun 24 16:54:43 2015 UTC,"Rock flour! Joffrey lakes are fed by glaciers, and the slow persistent movement of the glacier over time erodes the rocks underneath and grinds it into a fine powder. The meltwater then carries it in suspension to the lake. Depending on the minerals present, different colors will be reflected off the rock dust. I've only ever seen turquoise colors, but i imagine other colors would be possible given different geology."

CampingandHiking,3aumt6,fruitbison,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:30:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was busy for a Monday.  But as soon as we got up there, we found our own spot (this cliff we scrambled up).  It's always dead in the winter though :) Great skiing."
CampingandHiking,3aumt6,el_canelo,9,Wed Jun 24 16:57:44 2015 UTC,"The camping is amazing up there! I suggest you take a few days.  I'm serious, I'll help you plan a perfect trip - I've camped almost EVERYWHERE and I know some of the best sites BC has to offer."
CampingandHiking,3aumt6,Sedixodap,2,Tue Jun 23 18:33:17 2015 UTC,I will hit you up for this info too! What is the camp site booking like? Would it be suitable for a 4yr old and 7yr old as well  - inasmuch as how remote it is and facilities ?
CampingandHiking,3aumt6,el_canelo,6,Tue Jun 23 18:47:50 2015 UTC,"The parks recently put HUGE improvements into this hike.  It's a $5 self pay camping fee at the trail head. The trail  is basically a highway now, especially compared to the old trail. Much more accessible for all (which obviously has pros and cons). The hike starts right off the highway.  There are 3 lakes at three different elevations, all originating from the Matier Glacier. Here is the official Parks Canada site for the hike There are tons of camp sites at the highest (3rd) lake.  The hike is pretty steep, but I think your children should be ok. I saw a number of hikers in their late 60's - early 70's. If you can make it to the 2nd lake, you're basically home free.  The 3rd lake is quite close to the 2nd.  There are a few toilets (no toilet paper however when I was there).  The hike is one of the only dog friendly hikes in my area, which is amazing! Once you are up at the third lake, there is tons of scrabbling/hiking to be done. Anyone considering the hike - DO IT NOW. The amount this glacier has receded in the 5 years since the last time I did it was shocking. Totally noticeable to the naked eye. Sad, but this is our new reality.  Do it while it's still there!"
CampingandHiking,3aumt6,el_canelo,10,Tue Jun 23 18:56:01 2015 UTC,"OK I apologize in advance for being a stickler, but Joffre lakes is a provincial park (BC parks) not a national park (Parks Canada)!"
CampingandHiking,3aumt6,evandena,3,Tue Jun 23 20:53:39 2015 UTC,"And every (or pretty much every) hike off the Duffy and Hurly are dog friendly. Tenquille Lake, Marriott Meadows, Cerise Cr, Rohr, Phelix Cr, etc. It's a great zone."

CampingandHiking,3b048k,swampwalker906,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:08:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think I've budgeted that in. Planning to take the ferry from Grand Portage to the island, then hike to one of the spots it picks up from the next day for the return trip. Hope you have a good time this summer!"
CampingandHiking,3b048k,hi_in_fiber,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:04:06 2015 UTC,"Yellowstone is definitely a 2 day park, more if you can swing it. The place is huge. If you're into wildlife or wide open expanses this is where it's at.  Teton for dramatic craggy mountain landscapes, but it's more of a backpacking place than day hiking. I'd squeeze in overnight out-and-back.  Bryce and Badlands would be 1 day stops, but only because that's not the type of scenery that appeals to me. It's incredibly neat geology though if that's your jam; to be fair, I've never backpacked through those parks, just walked along the main touristy areas."
CampingandHiking,3b048k,hi_in_fiber,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:11:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I was wondering where it a single night backpacking trip might fit in well and perhaps the Tetons is it. Yellowstone stone seems a bit overwhelming, it's hard to know what to do. Obviously there are lots of highlights to see, but that's also where the crowds will be. Then there is the wilderness, which is huge, but how well can you really experience it in a day or two?"
CampingandHiking,3b048k,jessexbrady,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:06:07 2015 UTC,"With only a day or two, I'd just put up with the crowds and see all the roadside attractions. My memory is hazy, but there's something like 100+ miles of road in the park. There are certainly parts of the park that are less visited, even by car."
CampingandHiking,3azohj,kcswordfish,2,Wed Jun 24 20:10:54 2015 UTC,"I recently was searching for something similar. I ended up with a Six Moons Designs tent called Lunar Duo. It comes in at ~3.5lbs., packs small compared to many, can be set up with trekking poles or regular 49"" poles, and lists for $160.   A couple things to know.. It's a single/double wall hybrid so you'll have some  condensation to deal with. Also, you'll have to buy two poles if you plan to use them and a stake kit, both sold at Six Moons. You'll have to seam seal it yourself, too.   All said and done you'll be under $200.  And if you happen to be freakishly tall like me it'll work nicely!"
CampingandHiking,3azohj,wetphotos,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:39:28 2015 UTC,I was able to pick up the 2013 REI half dome + (in 2014) at a really good price. I really like it for the weight vs price vs features.  The two features I liked that a lot of lighter tents didn't have:   It has an entry and vestibule on each side whereas many of the lighter weight tents will only have the front entrance.  It is free standing whereas many of the lighter tents will need one end staked.
CampingandHiking,3azohj,V6F,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:32:33 2015 UTC,"Where were you able to pick up the older model?  I just did a quick google and couldn't find anything.

CampingandHiking,3azohj,Abba-zaba,2,Wed Jun 24 20:39:43 2015 UTC,"Any personal experience with those tents (The Chinese version or the original)?  From the pictures it looks like the floor is separated from the walls, but that they can be attached to one another.  How difficult of a process is it to attach them?  Or does anybody who has used this tent prefer to leave them unattached?"
CampingandHiking,3azohj,Abba-zaba,2,Wed Jun 24 20:58:44 2015 UTC,"I got the 3person Chinese version the other week. its pretty awesome. OP from that post has both and said he was considering returning the big agnes since quality wise they are equal but price wise the BA was 3-4 times the price.  what you are seeing with the floor separate from the walls is it set up with just the footprint and the outer shell not the actual tent itself.  the inner tent is a one piece fully functional and quality tent. but as are most good tents you have the inner tent, the outer shell (for better water & wind proofing as well as temperature control) and a footprint for minimizing wear and tear on the tent itself.   I did a lot of looking around and comparing tents online and in stores and this ended up being the best bang for your buck deal for sure.  also shipping wise it showed up within a week which was great.  There are the 2 person and 3 person versions but from what I've herd and can tell theres pretty much no way to fit 3 people in there. I still went for the 3 person for the added comfort and being able to have some of my gear inside.  all in all i would highly recommend this product."
CampingandHiking,3azohj,MotoFox,2,Wed Jun 24 21:14:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, it makes sense that it's the footprint in the picture.  Is the footprint included with the tent or did you purchase it separately?  And it really shipped in a week?  Like, payment to your door in a week?  Because that is pretty critical with my trip coming up 2 weeks from today"
CampingandHiking,3azohj,MotoFox,2,Wed Jun 24 21:22:17 2015 UTC,yea the footprint is included. the BA version does not include the footprint.   Shipping wise from payment to my door it took 8 days. they do say their courier service takes 15-30 days via china post. but they sent it to me via DHL without having to pay for it. not 100% sure why. maybe shoot the seller a message and see whats up.

CampingandHiking,3ayfo8,mocchan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:13:12 2015 UTC,"Are you looking for day hiking or backpacking?    There are a number of State Parks in Western NY with hiking trails.  Letchworth and Allegeny State Parks both have backpacking trails, and there is also the Finger Lakes Trail for backpacking.  There is also a lot of hiking and backpacking in Pennsylvania, particularly in the PA Wilds area, which is the north-central portion of the state."
CampingandHiking,3ayfo8,DSettahr,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:20:52 2015 UTC,"Backpacking. I've always wanted to go, but wasn't sure how to get started. I found this sub and figured I would start planning a trip."
CampingandHiking,3ayfo8,DSettahr,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:33:34 2015 UTC,"If you do a search, there are numerous threads on the ""getting started"" aspect of backpacking.  If you're willing to purchase a book, The Complete Walker is probably the single best source on the subject.  However you do it, make sure you start out easy- take time to learn how to use the gear on some easy 1 or 2 night trips first.  Also, make sure you familiarize yourself with the Leave No Trace principles.  It's important stuff, and there is a lot more to it that just carrying everything out that you carried in.  Careless or uneducated camping and backpacking techniques can and do cause visible environmental impacts that will diminish the experience for others.   A common mistake many beginners make is failing to familiarize themselves with the regulations for an area before visiting it.  Most areas have restrictions on where you can camp, how long you can remain camped there, and how many people you can have in your group.  Some areas also have restrictions on campfires, where they are limited to certain seasons (when wild fire danger is low) or banned entirely (due to resource impacts from groups illegally cutting standing trees for firewood).  Make sure you take the time to look up the regulations as part of your trip planning process.  In NY, you can camp on any state land that is designated as a ""State Forest"" (note: this is different than a State Park), as long as you are at least 150 feet from any roads, trails, or water.  So for your first trip, it can be as easy as parking on the side of a road and trekking a few hundred feet into the woods.  This actually isn't a bad way to do it  And yeah, definitely check out the PA Wilds.  There are numerous backpacking trails in PA, ranging from short and easy 2 day trips to rigorous treks that take a week or longer to complete.  The book Backpacking Pennsylvania is a good resource on backpacking in PA.  And most importantly, have fun!  :-)"

CampingandHiking,3azud3,HappilyFlummoxed,2,Wed Jun 24 20:54:13 2015 UTC,"This article kind of misses the entire point of a national park. To be considered for National Park Status, three requirements need to be met:  1.It must possess a unique natural, cultural, or recreational resource. 2.It must be in need of protection, and no organization other than the National Park Service would be able to secure adequate protection. 3.It must be able to be protected. (It is suitable and feasible to protect the area.)  The article sort of deals with requirement 1. But I'm hard-pressed to think of anything culturally relevant to, say LGBT that fulfills the other two requirements.  Even the designation of a National Monument has some requirements to it (which seems to be what the article is really pushing towards advocating).  And then the NPS isn't the only department who administrates the monument. Several others can.  I may have missed it in my read-through, but it doesn't even offer any ideas for suitable monuments. Just a demand that more monuments be made.  I'm not against the idea but it needs more structure than just a general demand."

CampingandHiking,3aujz2,evandena,2,Tue Jun 23 20:39:43 2015 UTC,Except that the syringe that comes with the sawyer has replaced the much smaller irrigation syringe in my first aid kit.
CampingandHiking,3aujz2,jhigg,2,Wed Jun 24 00:11:25 2015 UTC,Interesting repurpose. You don't see irrigation syringes in the typical backpacking first aid kits. What's the main use case?
CampingandHiking,3aujz2,MotoFox,4,Wed Jun 24 00:27:15 2015 UTC,"I teach wilderness med for Wmi, and it is used for cleaning almost any sort of wound. The syringe creates enormous pressure and control/direction of the stream, and really weighs nothing in your pack."
CampingandHiking,3aujz2,Big_Bare,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:38:41 2015 UTC,"Cool. I thought cleaning wounds was the main purpose, curious if it had other jobs. Nice."
CampingandHiking,3aujz2,Weserat,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:32:17 2015 UTC,Wilderness first responder here-- it is invaluable for cleaning wounds in the backcountry. It weighs nothing and you can't improvise one like you can with most other first aid supplies.

Loaded up it feels amazing, the pack itself isn't the lightest, but it is beyond comfortable. Of course, the osprey warranty is another reason why I bought it.  I got mine new for $170 (usually $220) from a company called Bentgate. If you're patient, you'll may come across a good deal. I don't know how some places can sell new 2015's for so cheap. I spent 2 months checking on ""Google shopping"" for a good price. It's getting to be prime hiking season, so I doubt you'd want to wait, just a heads up.

CampingandHiking,3aujz2,danceswithbourbons,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:15:05 2015 UTC,Yeah I need a medium and they all seem to be at the $220 price. I'm a bit in between the Atmos 50 and the Exos 58 which is the ultralight pack.

CampingandHiking,3ayjwi,Bad-Phish,2,Thu Jun 25 15:55:31 2015 UTC,"Fellow lowlander here. Best thing you can do is lots and lots of cardio. I don't know what type of shape you are in, but being able to run 5 miles 3-5 times per week is a good goal. Once on the mountain, the best thing you can do is stay hydrated. I get altitude sickness with nausea and headaches, so I often don't feel like drinking/eating. You really have to force yourself to drink. Also stay away from alcohol, it will make everything so much worse."
CampingandHiking,3ayjwi,myheadhurtsalot,2,Wed Jun 24 15:55:33 2015 UTC,"In addition to the tips on cardio, leg strength, and serious hydration, keep in mind that weather can change at elevation really fast. You can be sweating your ass off under blue skies on your way up, and within minutes the weather up top can flip and get really cold, wet, and windy without much notice. Good all weather gear is crucial."
CampingandHiking,3ayjwi,myheadhurtsalot,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:05:51 2015 UTC,Here's my question with the weather: should I expect large temperature swings in the middle of August? Or are the weather changes usually of the sun to storm variety?
CampingandHiking,3ayjwi,dackjim,2,Wed Jun 24 20:12:34 2015 UTC,"It really depends on where you're going and how high, but generally you can expect cooler temps up high, but they shouldn't swing wildly without accompanying weather changes. Also - sunscreen is important, too."
CampingandHiking,3ayjwi,per-fume,2,Wed Jun 24 20:26:51 2015 UTC,"Even if you get in great shape, there is still a good chance you will get a little altitude sickness if you've never been up that high before. Make sure to listen to what your body is telling you, and dont be afraid to stop for the day or turn around if your are really not feeling well... the last thing you want is to be really sick, really far from help. Hydration is key!"

One weekend, we'll go out to a trailhead and setup, hike during the day, come back at night, ostensibly scouting for our backpack camp.  The next camp weekend, we go to the same trail head with light gear, park the vehicles and retrace our hike to spot we identified the previous trip. If we didn't find anything, we head to another site. Lately our kick has been the IBAs in AZ. It's nice finding the little sky islands where all of the birds you didn't know existed in your state gather."

CampingandHiking,3ax6x6,mrneverland9000,5,Wed Jun 24 05:42:55 2015 UTC,Try soaking your clothes in permethrin.  If you're really worried about the smell wash it once after applying it.
CampingandHiking,3ax6x6,unwiredmatt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:23:19 2015 UTC,"This is the right answer. I buy the Sawyer brand, which supplies the U.S. Army. Spray 3 oz of the product on each garment, let it dry overnight, and it's pretty much odorless once it's completely dry. No need to spray anything on your skin or remember to reapply. The permethrin will last for 42 outdoor days or so. BONUS: Permethrin will also kill ticks on contact. DEET does almost nothing to deter ticks. (Edit2: According to thr CDC, DEET, depending on the concentration, can repel ticks for two to ten hours.  (Edits:grammar)"

In fact, I don't know if anyone really knows which repellents are attractants for bears, if any.  However, I don't think you should be overly worried about it.  I just wouldn't spray a ton of it before you go to bed or in/near your tent.  Store the repellent with your food either on a hang or canister, etc., and you should be fine."

Don't overestimate how far you can go - depending on what kind of shape you are in and the terrain you may only make a mile or so per hour.   Make sure someone at home knows your itinerary in case something goes wrong. Research what you need to do for bear safety in that area.

CampingandHiking,3awtpb,WhosJoeDaddy,6,Wed Jun 24 03:27:38 2015 UTC,Usually people will place a ground cloth under their pad to provide a bit of protection for the pad and to keep dirt off the pad and sleeping bag.  It's optional.  Easy solution is to just find a piece of scrap tyvek or cut a ground cloth to size from a sheet of plastic painter's cloth from your local hardware store.  It won't weigh more than a few ounces and you can use it for other things besides around camp.

But there are 1 or 2 nights where they make us go solo in which we won't have a tent and have to make our own shelter. I don't think I'll ever sleep in my eno (I probably won't even take it on the trip. It's extra weight I won't get the time to put to use) but I think I'll need to use the rainfly a few times.

A few kilometers noth are the High Tatras (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Tatras) with harder trails. Just have a look at the linked Pages on wikipedia to find some hikint trails.  That trails that I've done there are all marked very well. I don't exactly know about the camping situation there but I think you will find some information elsewhere.   Edit: Bring / Buy / Print a map to get the directions right on that trails. Let us know where you have been and have fun!"
CampingandHiking,3atadm,watever1010,2,Tue Jun 23 09:44:58 2015 UTC,Uhhh... you mean the third day of walking down the road towards Mt. Kilimanjaro? Looks like you haven't done much climbing yet
CampingandHiking,3atadm,AbeLincolnsChestHair,3,Tue Jun 23 15:25:53 2015 UTC,"Hahah it does look rather flat right! It's the alpine desert part of the mountain. It's called the saddle, and it was the part of the climb with the lowest incline. We did the 5 day route so this was about 9 hours prior to the summit attempt. We were at 4,700m above sea level here."
CampingandHiking,3atadm,TheWildGreen,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:03:39 2015 UTC,"Awesome photo, and I hope to be there one day! The perspective is really confusing. My brain can't figure out if you're like 30 miles from the mountain... or much closer to the summit from a saddle like you described. Hope you had an awesome trip."

I was just googling for reviews on the Eureka Airrest Classic Trekker mat and this post happened to be in the search results. Have you tried the mat on a previous trip? Please let me know how you liked the mat!  I have a similar 3 day, 2 nights trip planned in August but we're going to one of the hike-in sites at Frontenac park. My gear list is actually quite similar to yours, except we're not bringing a camping stove as there are firepits at the site and we're allowed to scavenge for firewood."

CampingandHiking,3avh9v,PopcornMuscles,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:51:12 2015 UTC,"I just did the same at the beginning of June--day hike to Angel's Landing followed by overnight in the Narrows the next day. I hope you can get a walk-in permit. I have no idea of the chances, but try as early as possible. Supposedly all the sites were booked the night we were there, but we only saw one other pair of overnight hikers.  We did not rent all the suggested gear and were pretty good. No need for wetsuits or anything like that. The water is not cold and will be even warmer when you are there. Of course, it may be different depth-wise when you are there, but the water never got above our waists, and then, only on day two. You can avoid most deep parts by scooting up to the side or making frequent crossings.  We did rent neoprene socks and wore them with water-hiking shoes. (Teva Ewaso for me. Not the best, but they were on sale at REI and had toe coverage. Sandals are not enough.) The socks were great for keeping our feet comfortable in the water all day. However, they made my water shoes too tight, which killed my toes by the end of day one. Something to consider. The other overnight hikers we saw were wearing neoprene socks with the rented canyoneering shoes and they were happy with them. They felt heavy to me when I tried them on, but maybe I'd wear them next time.  We used our hiking poles and didn't rent the wooden staffs that many outfitters offer. I felt stable with my hiking poles.  For clothing, I wore quick dry running shorts and a tee shirt. Wore a long sleeve shirt at night and in the morning when it was still cool. It got hot in the sun, but being in the Narrows, you are shaded for a lot of the hike, so it wasn't terribly hot. Plus it felt good to be in the water. We took a dip near the waterfall you pass on day one.  The hike on day one felt long since you move slower through the water..we were at campsite 9. Also we stopped a bit for pictures and such. I was glad to be doing it as a two-day hike. Nice not to rush.  All in all, it was amazing, beautiful, unique...a lot of fun. Enjoy! Happy to answer any questions!"
CampingandHiking,3avh9v,beeequeue,2,Tue Jun 23 21:20:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great reply. We really want to do the overnight hike, but it looks like the permits are sold out as of now.  Do you know where were supposed to go to try and get a walk up?   Also, what do you recommend for food on the overnight trip? Do we need a stove or will PB&J sandwiches etc. work?"
CampingandHiking,3avh9v,belugawhales1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:09:07 2015 UTC,"I went without a permit yesterday and got no hassle. I recommend starting the hike at 7am. Some cliff bars should suffice. I went with sneakers and felt 100% even at the end. It is seriously a very beautiful and gorgeous hike. If you're not interested in hiking in the entire thing a good place to turn back, is at the springs. Not anything different going further up unless you hike several more miles."
CampingandHiking,3avh9v,belugawhales1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:21:19 2015 UTC,"PS i got chaffed, so if you get chaffed by walking in water. Definitely buy spandex. You must or you will suffer on the way back."

CampingandHiking,3avh9v,beeequeue,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:12:31 2015 UTC,"I got chaffed on my upper thighs! So i meant like spandex briefs Lol. Anyway, I wore some regular puma cotton socks and my feet were fine. However, spandex socks would be great too. I don't think it matters THAT much since 95% of the time you'll be ankle deep in water so quick drying socks isn't really necessary."
CampingandHiking,3avh9v,beeequeue,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:25:04 2015 UTC,"I believe you go to the visitor center to get walk-in pemits - there is a wilderness desk there that opens at 7 AM. I also just saw that there is a last minute permit drawing: https://zionpermits.nps.gov/lastminutedrawingapply.cfm  Don't forget, to get to the top-down trailhead, you have to reserve a local, private shuttle ride. I went though Zion Rock - they pick you up at the visitor center at 6:30AM or at 9AM.  For food, it's up to you. We brought a Jetboil and had ramen for lunch, MountainHouse chili mac for dinner, a Knorr side for lunch the next day. Bars, nuts, candy bars for snacks etc. It's up to you whether you feel you want a hot meal. After a long hike, nothing is better to me than a hot salty meal. But some people are cool with pbjs and bars. We brought some water in, but filtered the rest and were good with that. There is a spring at the beginning of day 2.  To your question about South Campground below - we camped there the night before we left for the Narrows. It's walk-in, first come, first serve. We got there around 7:30-8 AM, when people were packing up from the night before and took someone's site as they left. There is a kiosk at the entrance. Grab an envelope, mark your spot, put your stuff down, and leave the registration and payment by the kiosk.  Man, I wish I was doing it again! Good luck with the permit."
CampingandHiking,3avh9v,beeequeue,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:31:06 2015 UTC,Thanks very much for all your help. We'll try to get walk up permits or last minute ones. Where do we go to get a shuttle up to Chamberlain Ranch? Do we have to pay for that?
CampingandHiking,3avh9v,birthdayboy31,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:13:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, you have to contact a local company and make a reservation. There are a ton of outfitters in Springdale where you can rent gear for the Narrows and make a shuttle reservation to Chamberlain Ranch. I think the one I used was called Zion Rock (we also rented our socks there), but there was at least one other company dropping people at the trailhead that day. Reserve in advance. My ride was like $40 bucks maybe? May want to do some research to select the one that works best for you. IE, if you're trying for a walk-up, day-of permit, you can't take a shuttle that leaves at 6:30 AM."

So you'd need to find a CA State Park within the vicinity you're looking for.  See here  We're coming up on 4th of July weekend, so it makes sense that everywhere is booked.  Why not just head a couple miles into a National Forest and do some dispersed camping?  The only difference is you don't get a picnic table or a vault toilet."

CampingandHiking,3aqkk6,awittygamertag,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:23:31 2015 UTC,"Sure.  I've only been out in IPW twice now.  It's a great area being so close to Denver and offering some amazing hikes.  The best advice I can give you is to contact the US Forest Service Boulder Ranger District.  They are going to have the most up-to-date conditions and would be able to recommend you a route.  If you plan to camp overnight then you need a permit (they're $5) and you can get that from the ranger station.  If it's a big group then I would definitely call several weeks ahead--they don't allow large groups to camp in some of the popular areas without advanced notice.    IPW is really popular so if you're going on the weekend you'll want to get their early (i'm talking 6 or 7am).  Most of the parking is limited and already a good distance from the trailhead (sometimes 1+ miles).  There are shuttle options to the Hessie trailhead from Nederland which you might want to consider especially if you have a big group.  Lastly, if you have an inexperienced group I wouldn't try to venture over any of the continental divide passes.  They tend to be very steep and challenging so if you do opt to go for it add on a few extra hours to your estimated hiking time.  Hope that helps!"

There are huge yellow pannels at the trailhead that say the trail can be lethal. I can immagine falcons defending a nest to be distracting enough for someone to loose their grip.

The office closes @ 5 I believe so you would have to get a permit before then. I've hiked there a couple times this season and the one time I messed up my shuttle scheduling and the Ranger I talked to told me it was fine if I pitched near the trailhead for the night. But of course this is very situational. I'm sure I can answer any questions you have.

Black Balsam is incredible around sunset, bring a meal and enjoy the show. If you get the chance Mount Sterling is a beautiful mountain in the Smokies with a 60ft fire tower at the top, the 6.2 mile Baxter Creek trail is rough though, it climbs 4000ft but is quite beautiful.

EDIT:  The Linville Gorge Permits are for overnight stays only, I believe.  So if you're not planning to camp out in the Wilderness Area, then you should be fine without a permit, I think."
CampingandHiking,3aq2mx,DSettahr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:22:28 2015 UTC,"The most recent hike I did in the area was Deep Gap Trail. You drive to the peak of Mt. Mitchell and hike from there along a ridge with a number of high peaks. The elevation is high enough that it totally does not feel like being in North Carolina, it's really surreal and just smells beautiful. The views were beautiful in the fall. I didn't go all the way, but I think it's about 4.5 miles each way.  What you really should look into is the 30-mile Art Loeb Trail. Haven't done it myself but am hoping to get a chance in August. Black Balsam Knob is actually a part of that trail, too!  You also mentioned Looking Glass, which I thought was great. Really amazing being up there. Before the final section, most of the trail is pretty straightforward switchbacks if I remember correctly, but the payoff was wonderful.  I hope you enjoy your trip, it's such an incredible area!"

CampingandHiking,3amkdr,MetaMainer,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:19:44 2015 UTC,Would stealth camp imply that you're just not on a designated tent site or does it imply that you're breaking the rules... or both.

CampingandHiking,3aq7tk,sprashoo,3,Mon Jun 22 16:52:38 2015 UTC,Gore-Tex liners in a shoe or boot will always fail eventually.  I'm surprised you got that long a life out of yours.  Sooner or layer you'll get a rip or tear in the membrane and that's it.  Gore-Tex by itself is not that durable and has to be treated with care to prevent tearing or ripping.  Since a shoe is always being flexed and stressed it's not hard to get a rip or tear.  The other failure mode is the membrane getting clogged with dirt or dried salt from sweating and then they'll stop passing water vapor and start allowing condensation and sweat to build up.  Let me ask if you used inserts in the boots?  Something like a Superfeet insole or the like?  If so then you'll probably not be able to get a replacement since hard bottomed insoles like the Superfeet are known to rip or wear through Gore-Tex liners.    You have nothing to loose by asking for a replacement.

CampingandHiking,3as0n3,emceeelwee,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:16:35 2015 UTC,"We have done the Teton Crest Trail as a walk up (trip report and photos) .   I don’t recall having any difficulty obtaining permits.   We did our trip a little differently than most.  What people usually do is access the Teton Crest Trail by starting at Teton Village. There are two options, hiking up about 7 miles gaining over 4,000 feet or taking Aerial Tramway.  However, we started our trip at the Phillips Canyons Trailhead which is outside of the park.  We have a motorhome and a car so we could self shuttle to the trailhead.   Starting in Teton Village would simplify transportation logistics but I don’t know if permits to start there are harder to get.  If you want to do the trip we did it might be possible to locate transportation to the Phillips Canyon Trailhead.  I’d suggest Googling Jackson Hole shuttle and start calling.  If they can’t get you there then they may be able to tell you who will.  Calling the Chamber of Commerce might also help.  The Teton Crest Trail skirts the edge of the park and it is possible to camp outside of the park some nights, such as in Alaska Basin, so permit would not be necessary.  The best thing to do is talk to a Backcountry Ranger as they are very helpful in figuring out a workable trip.  Bear canisters are required but they will loan you one.   We have also done two backpack trips in the Wind River Range - to the Cirque of the Towers (trip report and photos) and to Titcomb Basin (trip report and photos).  Any of the three trips are well worth doing but personally we prefer Wind River over Teton Crest.  There are fewer people and no permit or transportation issues.  I hope this helps."

What have you already considered? What type of trip? Long distance hiking where you setup and takedown camp every day? Car camping? Base camp?          How many miles do you plan to hike a day/week? An average of 15 a day would put you about 300 for 3 weeks. Do you have transportation or does that need to be part of the plan? Have you ever done a trip like this before? What is your goal (go as far as possible, see sights, meet people, ....)?           When? While some long trails (Wonderland, John Muir, etc.) require permits that are already maxed out - you could start planning for next year. Is this a summer or fall/winter trip? It's been low snow year on the West Coast - so lots of trails are open early. Unfortunately that means wildfires are going to be more likely this dry summer - so watch out for that too.

I am thinking of doing it in the fall, such as September."
CampingandHiking,3aqpij,DanielPedberg,2,Tue Jun 23 13:20:17 2015 UTC,"Great. This seriously helps.       The Shenandoah National Park is a fine idea. The AT runs through there, plus there are lots of side trails to explore. It's easy to follow and the road is never more than a few miles away in case of emergency. It's also one of the most beautiful places in VA. I've hiked it all and would highly recommend this (especially for a new hiker). Also check out the Blue Ridge Parkway heading south out of the park - a fine way to extend the trip or explore more beautiful areas. September is popular because of the fall color in the trees.          I've hiked much of the PCT through WA also. It is much more rugged than SNP, so I may not recommend it for a beginner. You would have to be more selective of where you pick and plan much, much more. There is much less room for error here.        I think the Mountains-to-Sea trail through North Carolina could be a fun choice. I've never done it all, but it's relatively new long distance trail and not super popular yet. Check it out.       A beginner may start with 10 mile days, with 1 rest day a week. Most people ramp up to 20 miles a day within 3 weeks, so at your end you could be there. Elevation change is a major factor in this. Get trail maps and plan where you'll camp each night (in general, it doesn't have to be a plan in stone). If you've never hiked a mile with an overnight pack - you really should get out and train/practice before this major trip. I would not recommend that your first trip backpacking be a 3 week adventure. Do a few overnights to get your gear and body dialed in.             Hiking to escape is common, although I wouldn't say I recommend it. But that's none of my business.        Watch out for September in some areas. In WA it's not uncommon to get snow storms in September. Especially above 3000-5000ft. It's a good time to hike in other areas of the country because the hot summer has passed.       Transportation is going to be complicated. Once you choose a trail, see if there is a shuttle. In theory you'll have your car at the start and pay someone $$$ to drive you from your stopping point back to your vehicle. Otherwise you can do a loop hike, which would take much more planning for a 3 week ordeal. In SNP you could probably hitchhike.             You have to realistically consider injury, simply not wanting to continue, or things out of your control (wildfire, weather, sickness, etc.). 3 weeks isn't crazy amount of time, but people twist their ankle on day 2 of a 5 month hike - it happens. Just be prepared for quitting at any time and it will help you succeed.         You didn't talk about gear, so I assume you are already kitted out."
CampingandHiking,3aqpij,VtotheJ,2,Tue Jun 23 13:58:02 2015 UTC,"I just posted this in another thread, I'll paste it here:   I have the perfect hike for you. Seriously. While I love Colorado (I take a trip out there every year), I think it would be a poor decision for your first time. Long term hiking is hard, it's a mental strain. I wouldn't combine that with altitude and very difficult terrain your first time.  That said, I would seriously, strongly, 100% say you should hike the Superior Hiking Trail. I'm from Minneapolis, and this trail works it's way along the North Shore of Minnesota (bordering lake Superior) on it's way to it's terminus at the Canadian Border.  It is 300 miles long, and is the perfect hike for 2-3 weeks. You get to see absolutely stunning views of Lake Superior, the trail is by far the most well maintained I've ever been on, and you get that awesome feeling of remoteness that we all love. Additionally, you're working towards a goal. You're moving to the end of something, which gives you energy and drive. You experience views most people never know Minnesota has, in terrain that continually changes.  If you have any questions or anything, seriously feel free to contact me. I just got done with the entire trail, and I am so stoked to share it with others.   Offer stands, feel free to ask!"

I couldn't find any 30 mile loops in my quick googling, but I'd bet that you could put something good together if you spend some time with a map.  I did a mid-October weekend car camping/hiking trip there last year.  The foliage was beautiful, and the daytime weather was perfect for hiking.  Got down to about 30 F at night though, which was slightly uncomfortable for me."

CampingandHiking,3arkqj,DSettahr,2,Tue Jun 23 02:59:00 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty familiar with the Cattskills.  The only way you're going to get a 30 mile loop is if you're willing to do some road walking.  There is one possible loop in the Western Catskills, incorporating Fall Brook, Balsam Lake Mountain, Willowemoc and Sand Pond Mountains, and Long Pond.  Like I said, it has a fair amount of road walking, but most of it is on dirt roads that don't get too much motor vehicle use.    You could almost certainly piece together a 30 mile loop in Harriman State Park, which is about 40 miles north of NYC.  The park has a rather complex network of hiking and backpacking trails and some nice backcountry camping locations.  The only thing is that solitude can be difficult to find in Harriman, even in the winter."

CampingandHiking,3aq4st,strickt,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:59:54 2015 UTC,The Sawyer Mini is actually one of the filters that caught my attention from reviews here and on REI.com.  Have you gotten quite a bit of life out of it?

No.  Is it the most comfortable pack I have every used?  Yes. I personally think that you should only upgrade if your pack has unrepairable damage, your weight savings is greater than 20% or you pack is uncomfortable."

CampingandHiking,3apnqq,izthistaken,5,Mon Jun 22 14:12:03 2015 UTC,"Do you have a reservation in Yosemite? It's beautiful, but it's a zoo.  Don't plan on just cruising in and setting up your tent on the side of the road; you have to camp in marked campgrounds only. The few places with first come first served sites in the. park fill up really fast.  Also, plan for bears. They are very common in the area and you are required to use the bear proof boxes in the site. If you camp outside the park, make sure to rent a bear container or string your food properly from a tree. The local bears will pry open car doors and such to get at food. They mostly terrorize campgrounds, but always good to be safe. There has never been a trip that I haven't seen a bear in the past 30 years of camping around the Yosemite and eastern Sierra area."
CampingandHiking,3apnqq,2wheels30,0,Mon Jun 22 15:57:01 2015 UTC,I wasn't expecting this response. Mostly about the bears. Haha You've officially made me nervous. Should I get reservations?
CampingandHiking,3apnqq,2wheels30,2,Mon Jun 22 17:30:19 2015 UTC,"Reservations sell out months in advance within minutes of becoming available, so you're a bit late now. Show up mid week and early if you can. Camp 4 usually has the most available, but it's a walk in campground, so you can't drive your car in to a spot (it's a short walk).  Don't worry about the bears,  they are mostly harmless. Just be conscious of them and read up on securing your food. This means all candy bars, trail mix , etc. Anything with a smell, no matter how small. Inside the park, bear containers are provided. Outside the park in open areas, the odds of seeing a bear are small, they tend to go for easy targets i.e. campgrounds."

Even though it was somewhat crowded, we really enjoyed the Vernal Falls hike (3 miles). We also hiked to Cathedral Lakes (7 miles, trail off Tioga Rd.) which was very beautiful and much less crowded, just make sure to bring bug spray if you hike to the lakes because the mosquitos were crazy."
CampingandHiking,3apkkg,Bears_Beats_Battle,3,Mon Jun 22 13:42:56 2015 UTC,"I have the perfect hike for you. Seriously. While I love Colorado (I take a trip out there every year), I think it would be a poor decision for your first time. Long term hiking is hard, it's a mental strain. I wouldn't combine that with altitude and very difficult terrain your first time.  That said, I would seriously, strongly, 100% say you should hike the Superior Hiking Trail. I'm from Minneapolis, and this trail works it's way along the North Shore of Minnesota (bordering lake Superior) on it's way to it's terminus at the Canadian Border.   It is 300 miles long, and is the perfect hike for 2-3 weeks. You get to see absolutely stunning views of Lake Superior, the trail is by far the most well maintained I've ever been on, and you get that awesome feeling of remoteness that we all love.   Additionally, you're working towards a goal. You're moving to the end of something, which gives you energy and drive. You experience views most people never know Minnesota has, in terrain that continually changes.   If you have any questions or anything, seriously feel free to contact me. I just got done with the entire trail, and I am so stoked to share it with others."
CampingandHiking,3apkkg,DanielPedberg,2,Mon Jun 22 20:40:25 2015 UTC,"Not to hijack OP at all, but are there any ~20 mile loops there?

This would be my first time soloing a trip and I'd want it to be about a four day, three night trip."
CampingandHiking,3apkkg,datsghetto,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:19:47 2015 UTC,"I can definitely help you out. The SHTA has a page that links to different shuttle services. There are no loops on the SHT as it is one straight path.  Shuttling is extremely common on the trail, and we had to have met at least two dozen people who are used some form of shuttle service. What you'll do is park your car where you want to end, and then shuttle south or north to where you want to start, and then walk back to your car.   I am a big advocate of Harriet's service - she is just one woman who shuttle hikers all over the north shore, and she is absolutely wonderful. 20 miles will be a couple trailheads, so you'll pay probably $20-$25 for that distance. You can mess around with trying to find a ride, or anything else - but a shuttle is by far the most convenient and stress free way of section hiking the trail.  Feel free to ask any questions about the trail - I'd like to help."

CampingandHiking,3apkkg,jay_emdee,3,Mon Jun 22 15:05:11 2015 UTC,"Ie never had the pleasure, haha. But the most important thing is to keep your food in airtight/bear proof containers, usually hang food out of reach. Here is some handy info on black bears. Edit: While you might come across a bear, the real danger is altitude sickness. It is a big deal. If you go into the mountains, I would recommend camping at a site near civilization for a couple of nights and taking day hikes until you get used to it."

CampingandHiking,3aph3l,PropManager,2,Wed Jun 24 12:46:01 2015 UTC,"The main safety difference is that you don't have another person to work through any problems with.  Two people are able to troubleshoot together, back each other up, call each other out when they are about to make a mistake...   You also need more time to set up and tear down camp--- with 2 people you can split the work.   With one, it's all on you.   Same with sharing the load.   You'll have to carry everything you need.  When there are 2 people you can split the load between the two of you."
CampingandHiking,3aph3l,SpamElemental,3,Mon Jun 22 13:32:42 2015 UTC,"I actually find that I work through problems better by myself, and hike better alone.  The reason being, I don't have to worry about letting someone else down if I need to stop, slow down, or turn around early.  I also don't have the peer pressure of someone ELSE wanting to go on when I'm not comfortable doing so.  Having said that, I wouldn't recommend being solo for a first time backpacker, but this guy seems to have enough experience that he'll be fine going two days by himself."
CampingandHiking,3aph3l,esskay1711,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:30:40 2015 UTC,"I'd go for it. It sounds like you probably understand the how to camp in the park, and hiking you'll have less to worry about than canoe camping.  Give yourself more time to do things so you don't get caught without a camp set up after dark, and be careful around the camp fire. If you trip and fall in the fire, or inhale a cloud of smoke and collapse in to it, no one will be there to save you.  The trails in Algonquin are well travelled, so even if you were to fall and break a leg, someone will probably come by before too long. Just make sure you carry lots of water so you'll be ok for a while if you get lost or injured."

I went out backpacking alone for the first time this season a few weeks ago & couldn't sleep. My mind kept wandering off to every little noise I heard thinking it was something that was out to kill me.   Then I thought about it for a second...do you have any food on you? No. Do you have a knife next to you in bed? Yes. Are you just freaking out? Yes. I focused on my breathing & listening to the beautiful sound of the creek instead of every little critter's noise. I slowed my breathing & before I knew it, I was waking up to the sun the next morning.   Nature is scary, especially alone. Be prepared (knife/food/lighting)  so that you can feel confident in controlling your thoughts to relax, otherwise it's never going to be enjoyable.

I was with about eight people, all in our 20's and early 30's.  We'd hiked about a mile or two into the site Friday night and set up, gotten a fire going.  We eat dinner and are just hanging out.  Around 9PM, five middle-aged guys on ATVs show up, and they've clearly been drinking a little bit.  We share the fire with them, everything is alright, but they're not really happy that we've taken ""their"" spot.  They five guys keep drinking, and getting a little more confrontational from time to time.  Then comes the kicker...they pull out their firearms and start shooting empty beer bottles.  I'm really uncomfortable with this, as are some other people in my group.  These guys don't seem like the kind of responsible gun owners that every gunner I know always talks about, they're just idiots.  Finally they leave, I breathe a sigh of relief, and we head to sleep.  I'm woken up around 2:30 when they come back in the ATVs, though, and I'm just terrified that they'll be coming to kill us.  I get out of my tent and basically hide around the corner from a lean-to that was set up.  They left without making contact, and there wasn't really any harm done, but man I did not enjoy that night."

CampingandHiking,3amegt,unclear_outcome,13,Mon Jun 22 06:43:34 2015 UTC,"You were feeling anxious because you were listening to your instincts. Storms coming, trails covered or washed out, no one else around, easy to get lost. These factors all sound like a great way to have something bad happen, with no one to help you out. Sounds reasonable to me. When I have a bad feeling about something, I leave."
CampingandHiking,3amegt,scottrazor,3,Sun Jun 21 22:53:53 2015 UTC,"yea seriously, something was telling me, ""get out of here,"" and maybe next time I will listen to that voice more seriously. Not worth camping out if you're not going to enjoy it."
CampingandHiking,3amegt,HyenaRuski,2,Mon Jun 22 02:54:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Ultimately one of my number one rules in the outdoors and life in general is something my father told me when I was younger and attempting to convey similar feelings of unease about our trip; ""if it feels weird, it is weird."" If something about a situation feels like it isn't right the simple answer is to remove yourself from that situation even if you're not sure what doesn't feel right. There's no shame in packing it in early over a bad feeling."
CampingandHiking,3amegt,TheMadMasticator,10,Mon Jun 22 07:26:48 2015 UTC,"My fucking dog. Sometimes my dog will just get on a tear when camping and just start barking randomly at the night and it creeps me the hell out. In the past my dog has had pretty good judgement of things (barking at a tree that fell later that night, acting weary around certain campers etc) so when she gets on a tear I like to trust her. Still, sometimes I just know she's barking at nothing (or something inniocent like another group of campers) but I've accustomed myself to trusting her that I get super uneasy."
CampingandHiking,3amegt,Afin12,7,Sun Jun 21 20:20:46 2015 UTC,Went out this week just me and my dog. Had to wake up super early to hit the trail before the heat. Alarm clock goes off at 5:30 and I start to get up. As I'm pushing my dog out of the way to open the tent I heard a gator killing something and splashing around. So sat in the tent for another thirty mins just packing my bag waiting for daylight to get to my water source.
CampingandHiking,3amegt,simple_cat,6,Sun Jun 21 20:20:31 2015 UTC,"I camp alone constantly and still get anxious about different things, usually on the first night. I've been in a position where I've been laying in my tent listening to a bear walk right by my face, not pleasant. I've also been in some nasty storms while camping on my own. Sometimes it's terrifying, but it always gives me a huge sense of accomplishment afterward for dealing with it."
CampingandHiking,3amegt,whiskeyjane45,4,Sun Jun 21 20:02:19 2015 UTC,"I think the events earlier in the day all conspired against a good night's sleep. Once you experience one or two of those huge adrenaline rushes that comes from thinking you're lost or in some kind of danger, it can be very hard to calm back down.  I recommend some whiskey for a small nightcap. Helps calm the nerves and quiet the irrational fears."
CampingandHiking,3amegt,AbeLincolnsChestHair,4,Sun Jun 21 21:10:19 2015 UTC,"I was once on a trip in the southern part of Missouri Ozark Mountains - I was with a group of about 5 people, so I didn't feel unsafe, but as night fell I was having a super weird feeling that night.   Once it was dark, someone says ""hey, I can see a red light over there!"" I saw to too, but it looked really far away. We were in a wilderness area with very few trails and very little sign of human presence and it was highly unlikely that there would be other people around.   But we kept seeing lights. It stormed that night and the following morning we found footprints in the mud near our camp, mud that wasn't there the night before because it hadn't rained yet.   I was so damn spooked I had a hard time sleeping after that."

CampingandHiking,3amegt,simple_cat,6,Tue Jun 30 04:51:24 2015 UTC,"I woke up once to a wolf sniffing our tent. Couldn't see it at first. The tent was just shaking and I thought our buddy, who had his own a tent 20 feet away, was pranking us. I called out and then we saw the outline of it's head (it was a full moon and bright enough to show his shadow). My husband (then boyfriend) grabbed me and pulled me to the center of the tent and grabbed the .44. It went away after getting its fill of sniffing but man, that was a tense 10 minutes. It was hard to sleep after that but daylight banished the anxiety. Darkness seems to make it worse.   The point of my story is that sometimes anxiety is warranted. You're out in the wilderness and you have to rely on yourself for survival. I say pay attention to your surroundings and the weather. If things look bad, get out. You don't want to be stuck in a bad situation. If you know you have mitigated as many problems as you can and remember in the back of your mind that you can leave at any time. Perhaps that will help your anxiety. And don't forget that darkness exacerbates it. Things always look better in the light, it will probably help to remember that as well."
CampingandHiking,3amegt,stoppage_time,3,Sun Jun 21 20:58:03 2015 UTC,"There's two things that stand out about this that have happened to me. First of all is the combination of things going wrong throughout the day. I've had this happen before with bad trail conditions and trouble finding a place to set up camp or trouble finding water or whatever that makes me uneasy throughout the day. That uneasy feeling definitely lingers even after I'm safe in my tent.   The second thing is the bad weather approaching. There must be something instinctive about changes in weather. Just like animals always disappear into their home when a storm is coming, I always feel the need to go find shelter whenever it seems like bad weather is coming. Even in a tent I never quite feel comfortable when it seems like a storm is coming, especially when the wind is blowing hard on the tent.   I'd say just don't worry about this one bad experience and hope things go better next time. Also, a small flask of whiskey or whatever libation you may choose can work wonders for me as far as feeling relaxed and falling asleep. Those irrational fears seem to be the first thing to go after a few shots."

CampingandHiking,3amegt,fdtc_skolar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:50:54 2015 UTC,"Sure! The mountain in question can be accessed via frontcountry trails (popular with dog-walkers and mountain bikers) and backcountry trails (very lightly used, normal to spend the entire day alone).  First time: Had a great hike to the peak, and was maybe twenty minutes from the trailhead. Took a sharp corner...and there was some guy in the middle of the trail. Just standing and staring at me. Like, he did not move a muscle during the entire encounter. I made a PR sprinting to the nearest side trail to drop into a residential neighbourhood.  Second time: Higher up the mountain, a little over halfway to the peak. I turned a corner and there was some guy, sitting down in the middle of the trail, back to me, talking to himself. He did not look like a hiker. I called out and asked if he was okay and he didn't answer. I turned around very quickly.  Third time: On a backcountry approach to the peak. There's a guy and a young girl just hanging out, sitting on some rocks. She's playing with a tea set and wearing a dress...a solid two hours of steep hiking from the nearest access point. The guy started to ask questions about where the trail went and it just felt so, so off. I actually called the police as soon as I had cell service, but they didn't think they needed to be involved. Everything about the situation felt so weird...that's probably the situation that scared me the most."

CampingandHiking,3aoizm,curiousincident,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:50:21 2015 UTC,"The no mat carrying strap has been one of the things I've noticed missing with the AG 50, but I guess that depends on what type of mat you carry too. Personally I find the AG harness a lot more comfortable than the Stratos but YMMV. Other than that not a lot more that I can add other than that I'm currently using a Osprey Aether 60 or Talon 44 or Granite Gear Crown VC 60 depending on what kinda trip and load I need to carry.  If you're after another suggestion the Osprey Volt is another good option, lighter than the AG 50 as well as having a substantial harness and is very adjustable too.

CampingandHiking,3amq17,chultzy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:17:24 2015 UTC,"I just planning the trip now, so I'm trying to decide what to do. What would you recommend?  I was thinking about staying a night, and I know there are some hotels or hostels at the base and the top. Which peaks should I climb? Should I view the sunset or sunrise, and from where?  Also I've heard things are expensive at the top, but how expensive? If it means carrying less, I'd be willing to pay more."
CampingandHiking,3amq17,chultzy,2,Sun Jun 21 21:43:42 2015 UTC,"First of all, I just want to be clear...you're talking about Huashan in central China with the famous cliff walk, right? I only ask because when I was planning my trip, it took awhile for me to figure out that there is another place called HuanGshan that is in Eastern China and is just as beautiful. The latter is generally one of the places that is cited as the inspiration for many traditional Chinese paintings. I did not do that one, and being that it's closer to the big coastal cities, I've heard it's more crowded.   Anyways, I stayed at a hostel in Xi'an and took a bus to the base of the mountain where you can ride a cable car most of the way up. If you get there early, you can probably hit most of the mountain in a single day and still make it back to Xi'an without much problem. The cliff walk is a ways from the cable car let off spot if you're interested in doing it. Things are more expensive at the top, but not bad if you're used to American/European prices. Also, you can have cold tea and even ice cream at the top of a mountain, so it's worth it IMO.   Bottom line is that if you are indeed talking about Huashan and not Huangshan, I think it's a doable day trip if you just bring a backpack with some water and money. The views are epic and the cliff walk is intense, but it's not the misty mountains of Huangshan."

Even the cleanest ones have a bit of an unpleasant smell. When I was tramping in NZ I avoided them, except in places where tenting was prohibited.  Even then, I always took my sleeping bag outside the hut and slept on the ground if the weather was fit."
CampingandHiking,3ai1uq,fernguts,-38,Sat Jun 20 19:34:35 2015 UTC,"Aw poor wee fella.  I am glad there are people like you in the world though, or the huts would be too crowded.  Will let you know if we ever replace them with Hiltons."

Beautiful FS70 by the looks of it. Any good reading or handy utensils? I love coming across huts where people leave nice stuff for others to use.

CampingandHiking,3ai1uq,in_anger_clad,6,Sun Jun 21 03:07:46 2015 UTC,"Who built it? Says so on the door, the NZFS built it in 1966 for deer cullers and other pest control activities. It is now managed for the public by the Dept. of Conservation.   Why is it there? Because NZ has notoriously foul weather, and you want a decent bit of shelter after hunting deer/tramping all day."
CampingandHiking,3ai1uq,fondots,5,Sat Jun 20 19:49:42 2015 UTC,"Our Department of Conservation huts are free to anyone to use (at a certain cost per night and depending on age, and whether it is a great walk hut or not), so yes someone else could pop up, yes there is the risk of them killing you, but after hiking 6 hours, wouldn't that be a hassle?  Built for the use of usually overnight rest, and the image does state the creation of the hut."
CampingandHiking,3ai1uq,ThisIsMyAngryFace,4,Sat Jun 20 22:50:11 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, American national forests often have cabins, shared camp areas, and pavilions that people stay at. People who don't even know each other."

Built by the Forest Service (now the Department of Conservation) to house government cullers (sharp shooters) who were in these valleys as deer and tahr numbers were sooooo high they were really damaging the environment."
CampingandHiking,3ai1uq,WigwamTeepee,5,Sat Jun 20 21:20:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly even in America you're pretty damn unlikely to get killed. I've camped and backpacked and stayed in a lot of shelters and haven't gotten killed yet, nor do I know anyone who has. There's occasional stories of campers getting killed, but with as big a nation with as many people as we have, odds are eventually some campers going to get killed, but the odds are well in your favor of it not being you"

CampingandHiking,3an3cf,WadsworthMusic,4,Sun Jun 21 21:08:44 2015 UTC,"Cheap bags that are warm will be bulky, cheap bags that are not bulky will not be warm. It's the classic gear triangle. Price, bulk/weight, warmth, you can only have two.  At your price point I do not think you will find a ""real"" three season sleeping bag that is also compressible to fit in your pack."
CampingandHiking,3an3cf,MotoFox,3,Mon Jun 22 03:59:39 2015 UTC,"Most down bags will compress really small with a compression sack. Your price range is a bit low though so it may be difficult to find what you're looking for.   Oh also, don't roll the bag when you are using a stuff sack of compression sack. Just stuff it in there and let it fill out the sack on its own. It will compress much smaller that way."
CampingandHiking,3an3cf,AbeLincolnsChestHair,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:32:04 2015 UTC,"I own the Crestrail 70, and I put my bag on the outside. You can either clip it under the top compartment, or down on the bottom straps. I know how small the interior is on the 48, I feel your pain.  That being said, I just don't think you'll find a bag for that price. $50-75 is pretty low for a small summer bag, let alone a small, 3-season bag. I'd just clip it to the outside until you have $150-200 to spend on a true 3-season bag."

CampingandHiking,3amags,jbrambledc,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:54:00 2015 UTC,"The roads there weren't as bad, but getting from Reykjavík to there was an experience. White outs all over the place, so be very careful when you drive. The 36 road out of Reykjavík doesn't have a lot of wind protection to block snow drifts. Once you get there, if you have well marked maps you might not need a guide, but I suppose it would depend how far in you were hiking. I probably would have hiked myself for a couple of hours off of the 36, but as you can see from the photos below, where I was the brush was low enough that it would have been difficult to get lost following a map and compass.    Also watch where you go to park the car, because going off road in Iceland is illegal, I believe.  Þingvellir south end, by Þingvallavatn lake and then the road there (36) .  I took both of these photos on March 8th of this year, and we were on a bus tour."

CampingandHiking,3akliw,NotDrKevorkian,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:00:16 2015 UTC,"Multnomah is certainly iconic and impressive. One of those places everyone will ask if you went too.  The good news is that the falls are just the start and you can do the full Larch Mtn trail or an offshoot over to Angels Rest, to other waterfalls, etc. The downside is crowds and being on pavement for the first 700' / mile.  There really are endless options in the Columbia Gorge so it depends on your hiking type as much as anything (Do you want gentle with great views? Try Eagle Creek. Aggressive just to say you did it? Table, Defiance, etc. Snow? Timberline to Crater Rock though that's melting fast).  I'm sure you'll get lots of general suggestions but explaining your interest, gear options & actual time will let us give some off the normal path ideas!"
CampingandHiking,3akliw,TedTravels,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:18:24 2015 UTC,"If you just want the best views of mountains, hike up east zigzag mountain. If you want waterfalls, hike the multnomah-wahkeena loop (crowded on weekends though) and lengthen it if desired by connecting to angel's and/or devil's rest. If you want a more urban experience, do the 4T trail, and lengthen it if necessary by connecting to pittock mansion."
CampingandHiking,3akliw,cosmicosmo4,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:47:28 2015 UTC,"Last time I was at Multnomah falls it was so crowded (parking lot full, people parked on the side of the road for a mile) that I turned around and left, just was not worth it to me. Maybe if you can hit it on a week day you would have better luck.  I would say Eagle creek trailhead is a great place to start, from the trail head there are 5 or 6 trails you can take which range from around 2-12 miles. If you have problems with heights you may want to avoid some of the trails which are carved into the cliff side."
CampingandHiking,3aki00,Akski,4,Sun Jun 21 02:21:34 2015 UTC,"Uhh you're supposed to get a cloud, not a stream. Bear spray isn't intended to spray a stream of pepper into the eyes of your would be rapist, it is, intended to put an ominous cloud of pain and suffering between you and a bear so you basically can not miss. But yes it does expire, expiration dates are clearly marked on the can. You would know this if you read the safety and use information included with the bear spray. But given you were expecting a stream and not a cloud I'm fairly certain you never read any of it.   I ended up approaching the bear [...] with 2 cans of spray   You should never approach a bear, if you had to approach him to discharge spray, it wasn't a threat. You should have been backing away, being loud, and looking big. Spray should only be discharged if the bear becomes aggressive and is charging you. And who carries 2 can's of bear spray?   recently had opportunity   I see nothing in your post describing what lead up to the encounter, it sounds more to be like you harassed and sprayed a bear for no reason."
CampingandHiking,3aki00,travelinzac,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:42:45 2015 UTC,"isn't intended to spray a stream of pepper   Depends on the brand.  Some fog, some stream.  I don't know what this one was supposed to have done, but I know it should have reached further than 15 feet.  The other brand that I had discharged in the past fired a stream.   expiration dates are clearly marked on the can   Not on every brand, unfortunately.   it sounds more to be like you harassed and sprayed a bear for no reason.   Yes.  It does sound like that.  The bear was digging through a dumpster at the outdoors school I teach at in rural Alaska.  I would rather harass this bear in an effort to make him go away than shoot him.  This is the first bear we've had near our student areas in living memory, so we are very keen to stop this from becoming a problem.  Edit: formatting"

These are not the same ones you see on ebay for $3. That was my concern but the website calls them high quality so I gave it a go. They are pretty nice. Solid plastic clips, thick nylon, large D ring and it is backstitched.   The light is bright and it was on pretty much all weekend and doesn't seem to need any new batteries."

CampingandHiking,3ahnfq,Infectiousmaniac,3,Sat Jun 20 07:05:18 2015 UTC,"if you're camping within a mile er so of a water source, you could pack a $25 filter and a few 32oz bottles/bags.  dry/dehydrated food is usually the way to go.  you wouldn't even need a stove/cookware, if you plan accordingly.  5 people is plenty to share the load.  almost no reason not to at least bring a stove and percolator.  don't wear cotton anything.  bring rain suits, and a change of clothes.  you'll get wet regardless.  bring maps, a compass, and don't get lost.  wrap your sleeping bag and extra clothes in water tight bags, even if your pack claims to be water tight.  if it's gonna be any kinda cold, bring long underwear and some sort of sleeping pad to keep your body away from the ground.  plan your meals.  you don't wanna carry what you don't eat.  but running out a day early sucks, too.  bring 50ft paracord and a water tight bag (multiply rope/bags as needed) to keep your food and food wrappers in (and never keep em anywhere else).  and hang the bag from a tree, overnight.  don't skimp on hiking shoes.  I prefer some ankle support, water proof, and really light.  but above all, they need to be really, really comfortable.  past that, it gets pretty difficult to dork up such a short hike with so many people.  if you wanna hedge your bets, there's only several billion lists of shit to pack and what to wear.  half of em posted in this sub.  edit:  you want a +1 tent (""3-man"" for 2 people) with ""full"" rainfly coverage (goes down to the ground, all around, and produces vestibules to keep your boots and packs in overnight).  and if it doesn't have an excellent reputation for staying dry, bring a lightweight tarp over 2x the length/width of the tent, and extra stakes/paracord.  of course, never set up a tent where rain water is likely to pool up.  also try to avoid old/dead trees/branches the wind may drop on your tent."

Two miles isn't much, but two thousand feet of gain and a slippery log for a bridge over ""that tiny creek""* over that same two miles may help you decide whether or not you want to pack in a cooler full of ice or not.

CampingandHiking,3afsb5,WeakCircus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:54:59 2015 UTC,Nice pics. I've lost my own pics somewhere.  No pic of the shower (waterfall)? I loved that.   Were you able to forage any food? I found an almond tree and sat under it for hours with my multi-tool slowly opening and eating almonds.   Did it rain a lot on your trip? It did for us. It was still pretty warm though.
CampingandHiking,3afsb5,sneeden,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:04:28 2015 UTC,"Why thank you!  Unfortunately we did the trip so quickly, 1 day in - 1 day out, that we didn't get to do any side trips to any of the falls.  We also didn't really have time or energy to forage for food. Our greatest regret is doing the trail in such a short amount of time. We did see a goat fall into a valley, though. Guess we could've gone and eaten that.  We had beautiful weather almost the entire trip. The first day was slightly overcast so the scenery was color-saturated and gorgeous. It rained overnight but not enough to flood the trail or our camp at all. Day two was bright and clear until the last 3 miles or so of our hike. Those last 3 miles were an absolute downpour that soaked our unprepared butts to the skin. Still a great trip."
CampingandHiking,3afsb5,sneeden,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:00:41 2015 UTC,"Yikes. In one day out the next is rough (I'd imagine). The last thing I wanted to do after hiking there was to hike back out. We stayed for 4 nights. My wife had terrible blisters. I felt bad for her. She lost a toenail even.   I think the rain made it even better, except getting gear wet.   You saw a goat fall? That's nuts. We saw tons of them. They would kick rocks down at us. One hit my tent (we camped over by the cliffs on night 1, but after that rock incodent we moved out to the beach.  Also, one morning after heavy rain I was up early and went to head over to the waterfall and this very large boulder came tumbling down the mountain. It went right through the main camp site area and stopped in the only unoccupied camp. No one was injured but that was frightening."
CampingandHiking,3afsb5,sneeden,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:10:07 2015 UTC,"It was very rough. We feel like we missed so much because we were constantly going and by the time we got to the beach, the sun was already setting and we were beat. I didn't end up having blister trouble, but my husband did. We were prepared enough to soothe them but it was still rough. The rain definitely added something to the trip, though I'm glad it didn't downpour the entire time. Those rock incidents are terrifying. Around Crawler's we had a couple near misses that would've knocked us right off the ledge, but nothing terrible happened. Did the locals leave a welcome rock outside your tent too? One of my photos shows a painted rock with all the flowers from the beach resting on it. Someone at the beach left it by our tent overnight and we always wondered if it was kind of standard practice?"

CampingandHiking,3af57u,Shit___Taco,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:15:32 2015 UTC,"Bear cans... Depends on where you go adventuring. If its in an area that requires them, you have to do it. Bears figured out how to get bear hangs down long ago. I think they too have a secret blog to share secrets.   In my opinion bear cans are pretty dumb for soloist. They're heavy and take up a lot of space in ones pack. Maybe people who manage to convince friends to go along are better served by their bulk.   Just hang a cheap sack from a tree. Some say use your sleeping bag's compression sack... me? not if it gets odors on my sleeping bag inadvertently. I always pack my food in a seperate little sack.   But I stomp about in Montana. Bears here don't bother with bear hangs. No need for cans.  Hmm, securing a bear can? I've thought about this a lot. And without googling ideas i'll share my personel rambling.... Wrap it in 550 cord and then put gorilla tape on the cord thats on the canister. Tie the other end of the cord off to a tree, or tent stake, someplace 300ft/90m away from your Zzzzz spot. Hope the bear doesn't chew through the cord.  And, try and reduce the scents a bear can emits by putting things in plastic bags. Use a mountain house? Roll it up and put it in a ziploc. Bear might smell it still, but not at a greater distance.  In the end a bear, if it gets interested, will probably kick that can around like a soccer ball trying to get at the food inside till it gets bored. I swear by bear hangs here in Montana.        And also use them when I head over to Wyoming/ Washington/Idaho /Nevada etc. If I went to the Sierra Nevada or the East Coast, I'd prolly use a stupid canister."

That way when a bear chomps at the tent, they chomp that and give you time to get teh zipper....  Smoke doesn't necessarily deter bears, so much as help you blend in with the surroundings. Tom Brown, in his book, says that pretty much every forest has been burned at some point. So the animals smell ashy smoke remnants as part of the natural environment."

CampingandHiking,3adfpu,WeakCircus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:19:33 2015 UTC,"Yes the trail splits off to the valley right when you get to the beginning of kalalau beach. You could probably sleep in a hammock but it does rain often so not sure about that. The beach is really long. There's camping back in groves of trees, along the ridge, and down on the beach itself against the small ridge. We camped on the far end toward the small waterfall where you get your water. I'd highly recommend that end. We were on the ridge where you could see the ocean but weren't directly on the sand.   I'd spend it all in the same site, especially if you get a good one. Spend the day exploring and also just chilling. Believe me it's a magical place. We dug ""sand seats"" using a frisbee we brought and spend a few hours just looking up at the cliffs, with all the clouds changing the landscape constantly. It was surreal. You can also swim around the rocks to another even more secluded beach if you're a good swimmer."
CampingandHiking,3adfpu,grovermoveover,3,Fri Jun 19 18:58:33 2015 UTC,"I've been to Kauai a couple of times. The island is nice, but if you want to see something great and have the best experience you can have, stay the extra nights on the trail. The views and experiences on the trail, Kalalau beach, the various falls, and the people you'll meet are way better than what you'll see on the rest of the island. Hanakapiai is amazing. We didn't get to see any of the falls along the trail and we really wish we had. There just wasn't time. Also, if you go around a full moon, the people who live in the valley have an enormous celebration complete with a huge bonfire, paint throwing, drugs (if you're into that), and dancing and music. We were told they catch one of the goats that live on the Na'Pali coast, too. We weren't there around the full moon so we didn't get to see the festival, but one of the people who lives there was hiking out at the same time with us and traveled with us for several miles. Having explored both the island and the trail, I'd give anything for more time on the trail."

CampingandHiking,3adfpu,WeakCircus,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:32:56 2015 UTC,"Camping is technically only allowed at Hanakoa Valley and Kalalau Beach. Hanakoa Valley looked amazing. We stopped there for lunch on the first day but didn't stay long.   We were visiting the island with family so they dropped us off at the trail head. I would recommend a taxi, even given the expense (iirc ~$50). Rental cars tend to get broken into at Ke'e Beach and that expense is just not worth it. The good thing is, the island is so small, it's only about an hour or so drive from any one point on the island to another.  In just a little bit I'll attach a link to an imgur album of just a few photos of our trip."

CampingandHiking,3adfpu,Canuhandleit,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:06:13 2015 UTC,"Pic #24 is the end of the beach where, if you swam around, you'd reach the even-more-secluded beach. Honestly, I'm a pretty fair swimmer and I didn't get in the water. The warnings from locals were very frightening. I found a trip report of a bunch of college-aged locals who made the trip out there in full gear (flippers, etc) and found it challenging. My suggestion is to heed the warnings about getting in the water unless you have appropriate gear or are a professional swimmer or something. Or a thrill seeker who is not afraid to lose a life.  Pic #42 is actually Ke'e Beach. I took that one on the hike in, actually, at the first breakthrough from the jungle hike. You hike for a bit and things start to feel sweaty and you're like ""Why am I doing this again?"" because the first bit is just directly uphill. Then you get to the top and look out and it's just ""Damn, this is totally going to be worth it."""
CampingandHiking,3adfpu,grovermoveover,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:17:27 2015 UTC,"It was a tough hike, but more due to the length than anything else. Not overly technical.

I can definitely see how it would be much more difficult with full sun!"
CampingandHiking,3adfpu,Canuhandleit,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:11:33 2015 UTC,"Be careful on Crawler's Ledge.  It can be really slick when it's wet and damn near impassable after a big rain.  Lots of people have died there.  Other than that, it's pretty mellow.  Don't go swimming where there are signs that say NO SWIMMING.  Also, lots of people drown by either getting caught in rip tides while swimming in the ocean and getting sucked out to sea, or by trying to cross a rushing river after a big rain and getting sucked out to sea.  The hike is very mellow, except for the ledge, and I've done it a couple times in just flip flops.  Other than that, you don't really need much out there other than food, some way to purify water, minimal shelter, and sun screen (if you're fair-skinned).  There is a composting toilet at Kalalau Beach but i'd bring some biodegradable butt wipes and a trowel anyway.  They're also really nice to give yourself a whore bath after a few days of funk.  Have fun!  It's a life-changing experience!  Bring some mushrooms.  I recommend it, highly."

To start it and try to hike like that you are just asking for trouble, low blood sugar, easily fatigued etc.  I normally keep my carbs at 40g or lower but on a long hike I will up them to 75 to 100g.  That is mostly because its easier to carry carby foods in quantity.  I still do not eat wheat or pasta but I will take some dehydrated fruit.  Just let your body adapt.  work up to some hikes or 4-6 hours and see how you feel.  If that works ok you should be fine for longer hikes."

CampingandHiking,3ahco7,stoppage_time,0,Sun Jun 21 01:42:17 2015 UTC,"You might get a more informed answer at /r/ketogains :)  The short version is that if you've been following a keto/zero carb diet and you've adapted (i.e. dedicated keto/zero carb eating for several weeks), there is no reason to stop the way of eating to go hiking.   It can take time for some people to really adapt, so it's common to feel easily fatigued or temporarily lose some strength/endurance when you start with keto/zero carb. If that's where you are, it might be smart to stick to easier hikes that are closer to civilization so you can turn around if you don't feel well. But if you're already past that point, hike on!  The only issues I've found personally is that I really need to pound water and electrolytes."

I constantly check craigslist and a few other bargain sites (steepandcheap.com, for one), and pick up gear when it's cheap - not when I need it.  Now I have almost an entire second set made up of decent gear that I've replaced with great gear, and I take new friends with me constantly.

CampingandHiking,3af8xi,puck_luck,3,Fri Jun 19 17:25:16 2015 UTC,Are those numbers ounces?   Your problem is mostly that you own very heavy gear. Try and slowly replace it with lighter options.   Ditch the lantern. Stick your headlamp in a white plastic shopping bag and hang it from a stick. Works as a great light diffuser and lantern.   Ditch the camp chair. 2lbs for a camp chair is insane anyway.   Sleeping pad weighs more than your tent? Thats crazy. Find a new sleeping pad. What is that just like an inflatable twin mattress from walmart? Look on craigslist for older thermarest pads. You can pick up a decent one for like 20$. It'll weigh about a lb. Or splurge for a nice big agnes inflatable. get you down to about 1lb.  Jetboils are really heavy stoves for basically zero benefit over something like an MSR whisper light.   Ditch the multitool for a basic knife. Half a lb is wayyyyy heavier than you need.   You pack is also super heavy. Is it enormous? Like 70L? Try getting a smaller and lighter pack eventually.   Lots of room to lighten up here.

CampingandHiking,3af8xi,Almostcomatose,2,Fri Jun 19 19:15:27 2015 UTC,"Pack is ok. Tent is fine despite what others say. 5 lbs for a 2 man tent is your basic cheaper tent weight, you could buy a lighter one but something like the big agnes fly creek ul2 costs $300 and will save you 3 lbs. You need a new sleeping pad for sure. That pad is for car camping, not backpacking. I was at the rei garage sale last weekend and saw two of these that had been returned. Me and a couple others noticed the tag said ""too big, tried to take backpacking"". We were all cracking up. Return that beast and get a backpacking pad. Ditch the chair. Thats seven lbs right there.   My single night overnight pack weighs 10 lbs. It can be done. Just slowly start to replace gear with lighter stuff and youll be good to go soon. Start with the pad, then the tent. Its all just about buying the lightest shit you can afford. Thats why the expensive stuff is expensive. my 10lb pack is stuffed with about $1200 of gear. tent, pad, bag, clothes, stove, blunts ;)  EDIT: you dont need the leatherman. your not gonna be doing any car repair up there. A little knife to open stuff is all you need. If your on populated trails you probably dont need a gps either. You already have a map and compass. I dont bring a map and compass on obvious hikes but I wont suggest that of a new hiker."
CampingandHiking,3af8xi,Purple-Is-Delicious,2,Fri Jun 19 19:34:07 2015 UTC,"96 oz for a sleeping pad is absurd.  The REI inflatable pad I have only weighs 16oz  I'd ditch the camp chair.  sit on the ground or on a rock.  if you're that worried about it take a rectangle of reflectix or ccf to sit on.  The fishing rod is also debatable as well.  Your water storage seems excessive, I'd ditch the platypus reservoir or the water bottle.  I shaved 5lbs off my setup going from tent to hammock."

My still-relatively-heavy 1 man Big Agnes Fairview is only 4 lbs. I'm looking at either a Tarptent ProTrail (26 oz) or a Six Moon Designs Lunar Solo (24 oz).   You could also skip the lantern if you have a headlamp, and ditch the camp chair that's adding almost 2 lbs. Strap a bit of foam pad (like half of a Thermarest Z-lite Sol) under your pack and sit on a stump. You can still put that part of the pad under your main sleeping pad to reflect heat back to you when it's cooler.  You could also use a footprint that's not as heavy to still keep your tent protected, but avoid a half a pound of weight - try using some 2 mils thick painter's plastic or Tyvek cut to shape.   I was also told to ditch my multi-tool, but I'm not quite there yet.   That will at least get you down to 35-ish or below."

CampingandHiking,3af8xi,gilmoredavid,2,Fri Jun 19 19:16:35 2015 UTC,"I have a half dome 2+. I'd only take it on a backpacking trip if I was splitting up the weight between me and another person. Otherwise a 1p tent will save you a lot of weight. Even a Lunar Duo Outfitter from SixMoonDesigns for $160 (or a Skyscape Scout for $125) will save you several pounds of weight on the tent without breaking your budget. Just something to consider.  And like others have said, get a different pad. If you can, look for them at REI garage sales, or even on the rack. I found a NeoAir Trekker for like $60 or something, and it weighs just over a pound."

We followed the Pine Crest Trail 7 mi to Barlow Flats Camp right on the river, spent a day there, and came back. Pretty mellow. Barlow has epic pools (chin deep!) if you follow the river downstream a bit and the views getting there are incredible. Most people continue 3.5 mi to Sykes camp for the hot springs but we decided to chill at the pools bc we have hot springs near where we live and my girl isn't the strongest hiker. The trek is tough but not ridiculous and the only cost was the stove permit (no campfires allowed right now sadly)."

CampingandHiking,3aecbg,GingerSauce,3,Fri Jun 19 12:55:08 2015 UTC,"I made the mistake of wearing my contacts on a short 3-day, 15-mile trip.  I say ""mistake"" because there were small pockets of poison oak scattered in the vicinity of the trail.  My dog must have gotten into it and then transferred it to me while playing/wrestling at the end of the day.  Even after washing my hands thoroughly many times in the stream, it was transferred to my eyes when I went to take out my contacts at the end of the night.  24 hours later my face was so badly swollen that one eye had completely swollen shut and the other almost.  I will never wear contacts on the trail again."

It's totally doable, you just have to take the proper precautions.   I carry a little 1-oz bottle of hand sanitizer, and use it to sanitize just the fingers I use to put my contacts in. A normal case will work just fine, you'll just need to have a good idea of how much solution you'll need as well.  Bring extra contacts. I don't know how bad your vision is, but if I couldn't see for an entire trip, it would ruin a decent part of the experience for me. Also, make sure your bottle of solution has a really good seal. I've ran into the problem of having it leak all over my pack before.  Have fun!"

They are really easy to take out without a mirror, and in the morning in my 'night' sack I have a small steel mirror that helps me put them in. To see when I take them out (encase its really dark) I always carry a headlamp with me, or my phone in a pinch  And in the morning I put them back in and go about my day. I just kinda rinse my finger tips off with the little bit of contact solution that is in the case but otherwise I don't put too much effort into rinsing my hands off. Never had an issue in the 15 or 20+ years I've been wearing them  All in  all it doesn't weigh that much. I have a travel sized contact solution bottle, the steel mirror and the plastic case and that all weighs next to nothing"

CampingandHiking,3ab8g0,SoldierOnce,3,Thu Jun 18 19:42:02 2015 UTC,"How long will you be there?    The terrain is varied with the toughest trail being Minong Ridge. The Feldtmann loop that OP was on is pretty easy woods, not a lot of  heavy inclines and some pretty spots, including a tall fire tower with stairs that are open to everywhere short of the top.    Minong Ridge is the toughest span, but IIRC they close it during the height of the summer because it gets dicey with no water and limited access for an extraction.     Greenstone Trail runs the length right down the middle and it's a highway.   3 days you can get from Windigo to Rock Harbor."

It looks like the current itinerary is going from Rock Harbor to Todd Harbor and back in a loop (with some variation to get to different campsites). It'll be a total of 55.5 miles. I'd like to do more but we're unfortunately going with some people who haven't been on a multi-day trip like this before and I'm not sure if that'll be possible.
CampingandHiking,3ab8g0,SoldierOnce,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:18:29 2015 UTC,Todd harbor is a nice one.     I was there in May this year and the bugs were already up.   Black flies and mosquitoes like to carry you off if they could figure out how to coordinate their flying.     Didn't see it this year but last year there was a water crossing just east of Hatchet Lake that was a bit dicey.   Don't know if they ever got out to fix it but the bridge crossing had washed away.   The water was really moving there and was fairly deep.     Enjoy the island.  It's a special place.

CampingandHiking,3aeuw3,shamoozleMcGee,2,Fri Jun 19 16:40:19 2015 UTC,"All of my opinion is assuming you want to take on the risks of going outside in a storm.   The situation totally depends on where you are at.   If you're camped in the middle of the woods in Wisconsin, you'll be fine. Moving or stationary, your chances of getting struck don't change much.   If you're 500 feet above treeline in Colorado, that completely changes the situation. If you're not thru-hiking, or if you don't have a strict moving itinerary to stick to, why not just stay put for the day? Rainy days in tents/hammocks can be some of the absolute best."
CampingandHiking,3aeuw3,DanielPedberg,2,Fri Jun 19 18:25:37 2015 UTC,"I'll do it but it's on the forcast but if you do get caught in the middle of a lightning storm it's good to be ready to bail.

First I have my leather Teva sandals, they protect my toes and have 4 adjustable straps for the perfect fit. I wear socks with them though for maximum comfort and sexiness. Secondly I have a light hiking shoe, Mavericks I believe that I got for cheap at REI that have the comfort and weight of tennis shoes with the grip and tread of hiking boots. They aren't waterproof and are a synthetic material with plenty of venting for the hot ground.   Lastly I have full on hiking boots, waterproof, but with the full ankle support. Standard hiking boots, light but sturdy.   It depends on if I'm backpacking, hiking, or jogging in the mountains for what I'm going to wear but if you need one pair for hiking, I would go with the second pair with the tread and comfort, just a hiking shoe. Hope I helped!"
CampingandHiking,3adk3v,Torquil190,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:16:15 2015 UTC,"I've had good luck with ""combat"" boots. I'm not entirely sure where I got my last pair? But they support your ankles and you don't need to worry about messing them up.  Also, they aren't waterproof. It's a bit of a personal choice but I tend to prefer boots that can get wet and dry out easily. It feels like more of a utilitarian choice. They can get heavy, but I prefer working through that rather than compromising how they feel to me and what they do for me.  Just like I really enjoy flip-flops if I've got some serious relaxing to do. Depending on where you are it may be a bad idea to leave your feet unprotected? I know of Kilimanjaro, but I'm incredibly ignorant of it other than it sounds badass and it's a big mountain and I'm jealous!   I once knew a guy who swore by those shoes with the toes. I've never tried them myself.  I've heard great things about Goretex. But the couple pairs that I've owned seemed to be more designed for being able to comfortably wade through a stream or the like rather than hiking very far. I have no idea if that's because of the style that I wore or if it's systemic with the brand."
CampingandHiking,3adk3v,NewMerril,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:49:41 2015 UTC,"For the primary hiking shoe, I suggest either non-waterproof trail runners or waterproof hiking boots. I went through two pairs of trail runners but decided to go back to boots. One pair was GTX and it was impossible to keep dry. The other pair just wore out quickly + I felt I wanted protection on the ankle from rocks, brambles, water etc, so I did get a pair of boots. I will probably get another pair of trail runners (and gaiters) but the boots are nice on my feet (I don't have any blister issues and trail runners were sometimes a little hard on the feet muscles) and I don't feel that much difference with the extra weight.   So, think about whether boots are necessary for you. People do use trail runners in snow and all sorts of climates and situations."
CampingandHiking,3adk3v,sharkinwolvesclothin,1 point,Fri Jun 19 08:53:31 2015 UTC,"I like a good waterproof boot. Preferably leather as opposed to Gortex.  I tried trail runners because that's the new fad, but in New England I'm constantly walking on trails with big rocks and roots, and trail runners don't offer any protection at all from smashing your toes against these things. I've had bruised toes and what not just from smacking them against rocks that will ache for days.  I do like how light trail runners are, and they definitely offer some great ventilation. Personally though, I don't notice the lack of ventilation in boots. That feeling of taking your boots off at the end of the day and letting them breath is also a great feeling.  If you're doing trails that are pretty clear and mostly dirt, I'd suggest looking into trail runners or a hiking shoe. If you are on trails covered with rocks and roots, you might need the protection that boots offer.  As for brands? Salomon, Merrill, and Asolo are probably the most popular and worth the expensive price tag. You can find adorable pairs of shoes/boots from Adidas, Nike, Wolverine, and The North Face. Wolverine being the best quality for the money and The North Face is not great quality but easy to find sales."
CampingandHiking,3adk3v,BigBlueTrekker,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:07:52 2015 UTC,"Just remember a pound on your feet is like 5 on your back. Keep it light. Unless your hiking in snow i wouldn't worry to much about waterproofing. Goretex keeps water out until the water gets in, and then it keeps the water in. Also it's heavy and hot. I wear Merrel Moab ventilators and like them a lot. Fairly lightweight, rugged and breathe well. I know you said you only wanted two pairs but I'd be tempted to get a waterproof mid for snow, a lightweight shoe like the Moab or a saloman trail runner for every other trip, and a cheap pair of crocs for water crossings and camp."

CampingandHiking,3adk3v,makinbacon42,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:08:05 2015 UTC,"Boots boots boots, so many choices. IMO there are 2 major factors you need to consider when buying hiking footwear; 1. Pack weight This is the most important factor. More weight requires more support. a makinbacon42 pointed out the Salomon Quest 4D, amazing heavy weight hiker. When you are carrying >40lbs i recommend a ""trekking"" boot. They have a stiff foot bed, deep heal cup and stiff ankle support. A boot like this may take up to 2 weeks to fully break in, but it worth the wait.  For lighter loads a mid-low hiker is fine, here the options are really wide. Buy one that suits your environment and most importantly fits very well.  2.Water Goretex or not that is the question. Leather waterproof boots really are not worth the money if you are a serious hiker. They are great boots, however they will die from the inside out. Let me explain. A good leather boot is about 250-350 CAD. They look great, perform great, kinda heavy and long break in. They are very hot and do not breath. Your feet with sweat too much and you will have a damp foot in most climates. In the cold they crack unless treated with oil, also if they freeze overnight it is a party trying to get your foot in the morning, trust me on that one... Finally boots have about 250 - 350 km life span for a heavy user. the boot may look fine but the cushioning has given up, the foot box gets really sloppy and the tread will likely be getting low/separating. So you end up with a nice looking boot that you don't want to exchange but really should. I have two of them, use them for gardening. Now Gore-tex. Gore-tex works on pressure to ""breath"". So when it is cold (low pressure) your warm body or foot (high pressure) is pushed through the membrane easily. When they make a Gore-tex boot the inner liner is the water proof membrane. This is because it needs to be against your foot to allow for maximum pressure difference and create ""breathing"". It is important to note that in warm weather, no waterproof boot or jacket breaths very well as there is no low pressure area to move the water vapour too. So because Gore-tex is against your foot it will breath better than any leather boot out there, also your sweat is contained to the sock and not the boot, you will notice leather boots always smell quite bad in comparison to Gore-tex boots. non waterproof boots are not really worth the money, use a low cut well ventilated hiking shoe.   IMO mid cut shoes are really an unnecessary risk... I guess my final suggestion would be a heavy trekking boot and a lightweight hiking boot. Both Gore-tex. maybe a pair of good trail runners, not waterproof. Never sandals for gods sake, unless of course you are in and out of water.   I just retired my Heavy boot, currently I have a North face ultra fast pack mid gtx as my light hiker. North face ultra trail (not waterproof) low cut trail runner.   TL;DR more weight = more boot, Gore-tex > leather, get two boots one heavy, one light, both Gore-tex"

CampingandHiking,3aazf0,BelievesItsNotButter,-3,Fri Jun 19 20:09:47 2015 UTC,That's what I say. I posted a helpful 5 dollar trick and they went wild. ''You suck! You're a dick! Insufferable prick!  '' Your guess is as good as mine. I have never lurked or posted here before. Rich people camp and hike. Poor people need to GTFO! NIMBY! PRICKS! And a sense of triumph about it. Quite strange. Thanks for asking!
CampingandHiking,3aazf0,BelievesItsNotButter,27,Fri Jun 19 21:00:20 2015 UTC,"You do your thing, but for comparison, my ridge rest was cheaper than three of those, almost certainly warmer and cushier, and likely more durable."
CampingandHiking,3aazf0,BelievesItsNotButter,-47,Thu Jun 18 17:13:45 2015 UTC,"Mine can be found cheap, immediately, in every town with a few stores in it. Auto parts stores are much more easily found than fancy camping stores. Sometimes mine can be found in the dollar store. Yours are 20 inches wide at your price range. Mine average 27 inches wide or more. Mine are absurdly durable and can be rudely smashed in anywhere in a pack. 3 will only be required in -20 F conditions, that I doubt many here will be ground camping in. One is just fine for winter.

CampingandHiking,3aazf0,WillCuddleForFood,9,Fri Jun 19 02:15:33 2015 UTC,There's nothing elitist about it. You brought up homelessness.  People buy sleeping pads to stay warm and to provide padding against the ground. Why buy this when you can get a $20 sleeping pad with reflective coating and then add a $5 emergency blanket if you're still cold?

You obviously know nothing about the rich culture of vagabonding, and the  desire to learn survival skills. You're trying to win something you are totally in the dark about. You've never met a hobo who spends lots of time off the grid with fancy gear? I'm sorry you don't get around much. I meet amazing people who have been to scores of countries. Very interesting lives they have!. They camp, and hike, and use appropriate gear. My way is cheaper than yours, for those on a budget who are cold, and probably lasts longer and reflects more heat. You just aren't interested in learning non-brand name tricks. That is a fault in your reasoning. You have lots of back up here from people who hate learning if it doesn't involve brand names. You just want to look cool with your childish and obnoxious bratty dismissive attitude. I was helpful, and nothing more. I feel sorry for you and your limited cognitive abilities. Ever heard of Alaskan seasonal workers? Ever been stuck anywhere really cold? No? You have no valid opinion in this matter then. I am looking to help freezing people stay warm.

CampingandHiking,3ad5m2,RoboIcarus,2,Fri Jun 19 19:26:04 2015 UTC,Gear list is here http://lighterpack.com/r/f4v6ma  I'll be updating as we figure things out. Not pictured are the sleeping bags which are on the way. We are headed to Colorado next month for a 3 day hike and camp.  Questions:   I know I don't need all the knives.  Which one should I take? Are we food heavy?  I don't have weights for everything but will add them when the scale gets here. What do you think of the Yogert Bites?  It's essentially baby food but thought it might be a great trail snack. What are we missing. (Don't say shotgun that's why there is a grenade) Do you think the monopod would work as a walking stick for someone?  It's bulkier but it weighs almost the same as the actual walking stick pictured.
CampingandHiking,3ad5m2,jmswts,2,Fri Jun 19 03:47:10 2015 UTC,"Look, I know grenades are all the rage right now, but honestly you could save weight AND money by just making your own household explosives.    As far as you other questions:   I think if I had to choose one, the one to the left of the pocket knife seems sturdy enough and handy in a pinch. You don't look food heavy.  I've only went a couple times this year and I took more food than I needed, but that's what I was comfortable doing.  Honestly, this is hard to say because you could both be healthy eaters or full time snackers.  You know your eating habits better than us! Again, I'm relatively new to hiking and camping but looking up the nutrition data on those yogurt bites, they seem to have about 120 calories per bag and I'd personally rather take something a bit more dense in that department like actual trail mix which can get you up to 700+ calories per serving.  Or you can always opt for a Snickers Bar with 250 calories. I'm terrible at noticing what is missing.  The only thing I couldn't find in your picture that might be handy was a flashlight, but a quick search of your gear list seems to have that covered.  Look good to me! I wouldn't chance it.  I think a lot of things can hold up as a walking stick, until the end slips between two rocks and you bow it in half.  That wouldn't be fun to carry out.  If you're intent on trying, test it's flexibility and sturdiness at home first."
CampingandHiking,3ad5m2,BestLightStore,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:21:53 2015 UTC,Thanks for the feed back. 1.  I was leaning towards just bringing the mutli tool.  But you mention sturdiness and the knife on the multi tool would be far less sturdy.  What's the scenario when knife sturdiness comes into play? 2.  I feel were trying to be ultralight conscience but will side on comfort over being without.  We won't go hungry :) 3.  what if the bites were just mixed in with the trail mix? 4.  I think I'm going to find a head lamp.  I mentioned in a different comment the flashlights are in there but there being missed.  Head lamp recommendations?  5.  Leaving the monopod at home.

CampingandHiking,3aac9q,smashlock,10,Fri Jun 19 15:48:56 2015 UTC,"I took an entomology class in college, and the professor said that ticks can never ""back themselves out"" of a bite, as they literally glue their mouthparts into the skin, and that no water, alcohol, gasoline, etc would make them back out. Pulling straight out is the best method. I think this spinning nonsense would definitely break the mouthpart off in your skin.  Edit: ""Hard ticks “glue” their mouthparts into the host with saliva.  Some species, such as the rabbit tick Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, attach shallowly and are therefore comparatively easy to remove.  Some Ixodes ticks attach deeply and glue themselves so securely in place that skin may tear when they are removed.  When removing a tick, lift patiently at the site of attachment to allow it to withdraw its mouthparts.  Fine forceps, and tick lifters sold in sporting goods outlets, are effective tools for removing attached ticks.  Hot match heads, kerosene, and other such removal remedies endanger the host in many ways.  They should be avoided."" Source"
CampingandHiking,3aac9q,AviusQuovis,16,Thu Jun 18 15:45:44 2015 UTC,"The reason fire and chemicals should be avoided is because they can cause the tick to regurgitate the contents of their stomach back into the bite, severely increasing the chance of infection by whatever horrible diseases they're carrying.

CampingandHiking,3aac9q,cykovisuals,7,Thu Jun 18 21:31:53 2015 UTC,"When I entered Army basic training, the first few days were occupied with watching training videos (in hot rooms, on little sleep, and God help you if you nodded off). One of these involved the dangers of the local fauna, (a lot about the brown recluse spider) including ticks, which, should we be infected by one, we were explicitly instructed not to remove ourselves, but to bring it to the attention of one of our drill sergeants.  Well, one day on the firing range, I noticed I had a tick on my forearm. Being an impressionable young lad, I did as I was instructed. The sergeant made a face that said “Why do I have to deal with such imbeciles”, reached down and yanked the damn thing out of my arm. Which is exactly what I've always done, and would have done myself had I not been instructed to do otherwise.

CampingandHiking,3acmy3,hawk3ye,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:09:01 2015 UTC,"The biggest piece of advice I can give to you is to know how to use your gear.   If you have food, shelter and water, you'll be absolutely fine for the weekend, everything beyond that is just for comfort, and it's what makes each camping experience unique.   If you haven't used the gear in a while (or at all) that could be your biggest problem. Do you know how to set up your tent? How to use your stove? These will definitely be your biggest snags, not what gear you brought.  Remember if you forget shit, or things don't work - roll with it. Some of my favorite/best memories have come from times where I made mistakes, or forgot things. Have fun!"
CampingandHiking,3acmy3,DanielPedberg,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:34:13 2015 UTC,Thanks and I actually gave the tent and everything a test run just to be sure that I know how to use it.  It just car camping but I just want to be thorough especially with my dogs.

CampingandHiking,3ac29a,iowajaycee,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:06:13 2015 UTC,I did the Southern unit segment last June and it was good. Be ready for Mosquitos and ticks galore.   You have to reserve the shelters before hand. (There are three on this segment). I ended up not being able to get the middle one so we just spent the night off the trail on the middle night.   I was with inexperienced hikers and we did the segment in 2 nights. The first night we went about a mile. The second day we went almost 8 and the next we went 7 or so.   Go north to south. If you have any more questions feel free to ask.

We did the Parnell Segment of the Ice Age Trail and stayed at backpack shelter #2 near Mauthe Lake.    Our distance was 12.5 miles each way, plus a couple miles thrown in when we walked the mile back to Mauthe Lake campgrounds for water.    I really liked the Parnell Segment, as it has plenty of rocks and rolling hills to keep things interested.  You pass several kettle lakes and get some decent scenery.   I prefer the Northern Unit of the Kettle Moraine over the Southern Unit."

CampingandHiking,3adgle,hiker_bro,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:52:06 2015 UTC,"Right that's a valid idea however a rental for sitting for 8 days would cost a minimum $500 which is almost as bad as the shuttle situation.

CampingandHiking,3adgle,hiker_bro,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:04:54 2015 UTC,This only requires a one day rental. You leave your own car at the exit and return the rental in Visalia. You can pick up the rental wherever your friend flies into

I'd see if you can get a rideshare back from Lone Pine (or thereabouts) at any time before July 9th, and then drive out and leave your car there and come back via the rideshare. Then take the Sequoia Shuttle from Fresno up to the park (AMTRAK goes from the East Bay to Fresno).  Or the one-day rental to dump your car at Lone Pine, as suggested, and then the Sequoia Shuttle.  Or buy some more food in Lone Pine and hike back...:)."
CampingandHiking,3aaqxt,jhturbo,5,Thu Jun 18 16:06:44 2015 UTC,"Teva Churn. These are the first pair of shoes I've bought more than once because of exactly what you are describing. I have done long hikes (10 miles in a day) in them. They are lightweight (I recently took them on a bike tour as my walking around shoes). Dry quickly. Don't hold water and are grippy in a creek. Plus the heel folds down so they can comfortably be worn as sandals. Also, they have a few color options. http://www.teva.com/men-shoes/churn/4153.html?dwvar_4153_color=VIND#start=9&cgid=men-shoes"

CampingandHiking,3aaqxt,vjmurphy,3,Sun Jun 21 02:31:17 2015 UTC,Keens have very durable sole and toe protection while the rest is more like a sandal for drainage and ventilation. They were fairly comfortable for 5-10 miles on a rainy day. I have also worn them all day playing in the creek.  They have a reputation for bad odor but I find that keeping them clean helps (throw them in the washer between trips). You can also use foot spray if it bothers you that much.
CampingandHiking,3aaqxt,frigginjensen,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:15:45 2015 UTC,"Seconding Keens! I've worn mine on a few 30+ mile backpacking trips and lots of day hikes. Comfy, good toe protection, and I haven't had any smell issues either."

Comfy, grippy, and dry fast, especially with the removable pad inserts. Just stay away from the models with mesh as they will let small pebbles in but not out.

CampingandHiking,3aaqxt,Triangular_Desire,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:46:36 2015 UTC,"I find that when chacos are sized properly they will have decent lip around your toes which prevent me from stubbing my toes on any rocks or other objects. The only protection I don't have in mine are from objects falling on my toes which is not that common for me in the backcountry. So personally I find the Chacos to be more than protective enough and extra comfortable compared to the keens I have worn. That being said it is largely personal preference and when you are wearing any outdoor water sandal you need to be more aware of your surroundings compared to wearing a boot. As a formating note you can create links by closing your text in brackets like these [ with the highlighted word and then placing the link in parenthesis like this ( after, including the closing symbols too. In the end it looks like this, Buy some Chacos!"
CampingandHiking,3aaqxt,lasttycoon,2,Thu Jun 18 19:57:05 2015 UTC,"For general water crossings my trail runners drain and dry fast enough for me.  Maybe swapping socks at some point if the wet sections were all on the first part of the hike or something. You can also swap into something like crocs for the crossings if they're big enough to be worth the time spent swapping shoes.  If you're slogging up a creekbed for hours though, or just want a more watery shoe, there are options.  Personally I'm a fan of Astral.  The Brewer or Aquanaut would be good bets, probably the Aquanaut if you're doing a fair amount of hiking."
CampingandHiking,3aaqxt,freedomweasel,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:33:07 2015 UTC,"+1 on this.  If you're going 30 miles, only a tiny fraction of that is in water. Any decent hiking shoe or boot should be able to do fords with no issues. Full-on water shoes are a compromise, and not necessary or advised for a virtually all-land hike."
CampingandHiking,3aaqxt,211logos,2,Sun Jun 21 17:40:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, Just did the Narrows hike and by far the best shoe that was recommended was the 5.10 Canyoneer 3 shoe.  It is very good in water since it was designed for narrows and water hikes but it's also comfortable for normal hikes.   I also used trail runners for water crossing and while it was great, after 9 miles of hiking in the water, it really hurt the feet and didn't protect the toes.  Then again, you may not be hiking in the water as much as I was."
CampingandHiking,3aaqxt,CoGa,2,Thu Jun 18 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"I, too, just did the Zion Narrows. I wore Teva Ewaso (women's) water shoes (still on sale at REI) and rented neoprene socks. The Tevas were great for toe protection, not holding water and drying. I wore them for 16 miles over two days. The problem was: they were great in the water with the socks, not so good on land. So for you I would recommend them as backup for the crossings, but not as your main pair of hiking shoes. They were lightweight, and fit in the outside pocket of my pack.  Aside: for anyone considering neoprene socks for a water hike, don't do what I did and wear them with your regular size shoes. My toes were killing by the end."

CampingandHiking,3aaqxt,juusol,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:54:20 2015 UTC,Under Armour makes a great water/boat shoe that should be durable enough for your hike. They've also got a couple other models besides the link below:  https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/mens-ua-hydro-spin-boat-shoes/pid1254876

It rained alot but kept my feet dry!
CampingandHiking,3aaqxt,DUBWEISER80,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:05:55 2015 UTC,They would take forever to dry out though. OP is looking for a shoe he can submerge and will drain the water and dry quickly. Waterproof merrels are the exact opposite of this.

Saying it's ""the ultimate antithesis of arkieoutdoors"" literally makes no sense to a native."

CampingandHiking,3a7uun,IAreGraham,2,Thu Jun 18 03:05:16 2015 UTC,If you're going to be out in that area I would also suggest checking out Caney Creek Loop (Buckeye Trail down to East Caney Creek Trail). I've done both and even though Caney Creek is shorter than ERL I would say you get just as much awesome scenery. Here's an album from my trip out to Caney Creek last fall!

CampingandHiking,3aakz1,swardoph,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:25:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! That german report gives a good honest idea of some of the potential challenges. I had already read parts of the Peaks of the Balkan website, and it seems that they offer a bit more than they can deliver. Or at least their information is a bit of an incomplete picture of the level of organization in the region (for example the amounts of (semi-) serviced huts they name is nowhere near the real thing)."
CampingandHiking,3aakz1,swardoph,2,Thu Jun 18 20:55:26 2015 UTC,"From zbulo.org > Try to prepare and adjust to the Balkans’ mentality to avoid frustration...  You are not going to find an answer to every question that comes up prior to the trip. But I am certain things will work out well while on the trip. The level of organization may not come up to ""our"" standards, but will be compensated by helpfulness.   Maybe /r/albania or the guys from zbulo can answer some specific questions. Other than that I found this short brochure brochure. Likely the most accurate informations regarding serviced huts comes from this (new) german guidebook."

You could park at Appalachia and then, depending on timing, either pitch a tent off the trail down near the trail head or make it all the way to Crag camp or valley way tentsite. Then the next day hike along the ridge over Madison, Adams and Jefferson before heading back down.  edit: I agree with /u/pjm73, get a map. I know there are a few REI's in the Boston area, which I believe should carry the Appalachian Mountain Club map of the White Mountains. Hilton's Tent City near North Station should have them as well."

In the morning (or that same day, depending on what you want to do) you leave your gear at the camp then just take a snack+water and hike up to North and South Kinsman peaks. Then take Kinsman Pond trail back to Lonesome Lake trail to return to your car. It's not exactly a full loop but you won't be totally retracing your steps either."

I've been using it for 2~3 day trips with ultralight gear and have found that it's very comfortable plus absurdly strong in construction.  Lots of strap points and the big mesh pocket let you strap gear to the outside to extend the use of it.  The Trail looks like a big daypack and lacks the feature set of the Flash, weighs more, and costs more.  If you're camping go with the Flash."
CampingandHiking,3abau1,AlternativelyYouCan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:29:23 2015 UTC,I just got the trail and I love it. It's very well thought out with just enough features to remain useful in almost any situation. The design makes it heavier than the flash but you'll feel comfortable using it in more situations than the flash.  I've had a smaller flash for awhile and use it for gym and what not but the lack of support/any rigid structure prevents me from using it more.

CampingandHiking,3aaa2j,eng_dev,4,Thu Jun 18 13:53:19 2015 UTC,"I have a DeLorme inReach SE and like it a lot, although I can't speak for the service as a basis for comparison because I've never used a Spot. It has some trouble when there's dense tree coverage or deep valleys, but given enough time and a small clearing I've never had a message not go out.  The selling feature for me was the ability to send various pre-determined messages to certain contacts without needing to use a phone (although it can pair via bluetooth). As well as free-form message straight from the device, which pretty much makes it a two-way texting/email device if you wish to use it that way.  There's also the inReach Explorer which has all those features plus built-in mapping and waypoint navigation. The SE requires a phone to do waypoints and mapping.  Only downside is it's damn expensive."
CampingandHiking,3aaa2j,hi_in_fiber,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:02:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those look great but the price is a bit high for something I would hope I would never to have to use."
CampingandHiking,3aaa2j,hi_in_fiber,2,Thu Jun 18 17:03:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the price is pretty insane. Fortunately, the plan can be activated and deactivated on a monthly basis.  I use mine mostly for the two-way communication capability.  It's useful if you have a change/delay in itinerary so your emergency contacts don't get freaked out. Or if you need someone to pick you up or bring something in a non-emergency situation."
CampingandHiking,3aaa2j,confusedseas,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:11:02 2015 UTC,It's seems like the inReach is ultimately cheaper and more functional than SPOT. I have a few friends with inReaches and they are stoked on them. One does SAR and it proved to be so useful the whole team got outfitted with them.
CampingandHiking,3aaa2j,hi_in_fiber,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:20:20 2015 UTC,"I can imagine the two-way communication being very useful in a SAR situation. The ability to describe the extent of injuries so proper equipment and gear is brought in, as well as possible extraction locations to speed up rescue. Definitely an invaluable tool to have, just hope you never have to use it.  The spot can do the same things, it just relies on a phone which introduces an extra point of failure."
CampingandHiking,3aaa2j,groff200,3,Fri Jun 19 05:36:28 2015 UTC,"I'm curious about this too, as I just bought my Spot Gen3 a couple of days ago.  In reading on it, I found some reviewers who really beat up on the device and claimed it didn't work as well as advertised, then insisted hikers should get a PRB instead.   But the PRB has its own issues too that I didn't like...heavier, batteries are a pain to deal with, etc.   I ended up going with the Gen3 anyway because I didn't see another consumer device at that price and with those features."

One thing about the ultralight that is important to mention...it's designed for someone who is 6' or less in height and 200lbs or less in weight.   If you are really tall or over 200lbs, you can still get a Hennessy hammock but you might not want the ultralight model."

Can't answer your question regarding Cortina (or Venice) but the guys from the tourist office sure can (cortina@dolomiti.org / found here).
CampingandHiking,3a9rio,swardoph,2,Thu Jun 18 17:16:02 2015 UTC,"I've found campingaz gas to be pretty easy to find all over Europe, they also have a ""retailer locations"" map on their website, and it looks like there's quite a few shops in the Venice area that are fairly likely to stock gas.  (If you're spending your first night on a campsite with a little shop it's a common thing to stock, and if you wanted to ask in advance I'd expect them to have enough English if you emailed them)  There's a Decathlon in Mestre that is also pretty likely to have stove fuels."

CampingandHiking,3a86mz,meyerpw,3,Thu Jun 18 00:54:46 2015 UTC,"You might get a better response in /r/hammocks or /r/hammockcamping but I'm happy to share my thoughts, too.  I started out with an indoor hammock, the most common one you'll find on Amazon.  I slept in it, and felt great the next day.  Seeing as I've had back/neck problems ever since I can remember, I was glad to find something that wouldn't cause me pain through the night and the next day.  Since then, I've purchased 3 more hammocks specifically for hanging outdoors and backpacking.  I've also purchased a 1-person tent and sleeping pad.  Before I'll take any gear in the woods, the first thing I do is test it somewhere I can easily bail out if need be.  I couldn't stand to be on a sleeping pad for even an hour.  I admit it was just a cheap one, but it reminded me why I was so miserable the last time I was in a tent, too.  I've tested two of my other hammocks for overnight sleeping myself, while a family member has been kind enough to test out the third outdoor hammock.  There are some things I do like, and others I don't.  I'll start with the ""don't"" first.  I don't like that I lack that (false) sense of security you get from having tent walls.  I don't like having a bird take a dump on me if it's a nice day and I choose not to put up my rainfly.  Getting in a mummy sleeping bag while in a hammock is a huge chore; I actually stand up in it outside the hammock now, the attempt to get in the hammock.  Getting to sleep takes me a while since I don't sleep in a hammock that often and am not used to it.  A mid-night restroom break can become quite a chore.  Piecing all of the equipment together to get your perfect hang can be a real challenge.  Now for the things I do like.  The most important thing is comfort.  When you find that sweet spot in the right hammock, it's just amazing.  Then there's the view.  While being in the open can be terrifying, it's great when there's a spot with a view.  Ventilation also makes the list.  If you're going to camp in cold weather, it can be rather expensive to by topquilts and underquilts.  However, when you hike on a 90* day (Freedom Units) and the low at night is 75, that ventilation is the only thing that makes night bearable.  For where to start and what to look for, you can find it all on hammockforums.net.  theultimatehang.com is also great.  Basically, if you're going to be backpacking, you'll need to find the right comfort/weight combination.  Also, factor in costs for quilts, a rainfly, replacing the suspension with something lightweight, and the moneypit that this hammocking can become.  And keep an eye on the ""deal"" hammocks.  For instance the Yukon one referenced by /u/shovelgut is less than 9' long.  I have a Yukon hammock myself, but would never recommend that hammock to someone more than 5' tall."
CampingandHiking,3a86mz,thepingster,2,Thu Jun 18 01:36:30 2015 UTC,"I personally have the Yukon outfitters hammock with the mosquito net and I purchased atlas straps to go with it.

Atlas straps have like 10 loops on the strap so all you do is run the strap around the tree, through the far loop and synch it tight then clip your hammock on whatever loop fits the height properly. That way you can fit your hammock on pretty much any tree any distance from each other. Plus each strap holds like 200lbs, so that helps."

CampingandHiking,3a86mz,realoldfatguy,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:04:04 2015 UTC,"I use a Grand Trunk Skeeter Beeter Pro (it has a bug net).  It comes with a hang kit (a rope for each end), but I added whoopie slings, two 15 foot tow straps to go around the trees, a structural ridgeline, an underquilt from DD Hammocks and various different tarps to go over the top.  I also built a set of turtle dog stands (plans for these are over on Hammock Forum) that I use when car camping and in my back yard."
CampingandHiking,3a86mz,groff200,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:27:27 2015 UTC,"I have been a tent camper for years now.   The reason I did not get a hammock previously is because of the effort required to insulate them for winter.   I have a friend who uses one, and he seemed to be carrying much more weight for his sleeping system than I did when we were out in winter.  However, I went a hiking trip again a couple of weeks ago.  I am in the deep south and by dumb luck I picked the first day of summer to exceed 90 degrees and have 95% humidity.   So it was really, really hot and uncomfortable until about 10pm.   My tent basically turned into an oven while my friend with the hammock was much more comfortable.  Since I live in a place where it is hot most of the year, I went ahead and bought a Hennessy ultralight hammock.  Thankfully, at 1lb 9oz it is also lighter than my ultralight tent.   I have yet to use it on an overnight, but I expect it will be comfortable with my inflatable sleeping pad.   The other pleasant thing I discovered was that I could drop my pack weight even more by using this hammock.  My camp stool that I carried with me to have a place to sit...I no longer need it with my hammock.   The big tarp that I carried to use as a ground cloth for my tent or to put up something to keep me dry in a rain storm...I don't need it because there is a lightweight rainfly with the hammock already.    By switching to this sleep system, my pack weight dropped between 6-8 pounds.  I did see some videos on YouTube of people that didn't even use an under quilt with the hammock in winter though.  These people used an inflatable pad and sleeping bag and seemed to be fine.   I will have to experiment in winter to see how hard it is to insulate the hammock.  But I figure I can always use my tent if I don't like it."
CampingandHiking,3a86mz,eatyourspinach,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:47:58 2015 UTC,"I used a Hennessy on a two-week trip and hated every night. If you're lucky enough to find two trees close enough together to hang between, you better hope it won't be cold or windy, because I found that the hammock provided basically no insulation. I had a pad and a nice down sleeping bag, but was so cold that I used an emergency blanket some nights. The wind just blows right through those things... and under them, and over them. If you lay diagonal to straighten out your spine, then the velcro opening on the underside of the hammock runs across your back at an uncomfortable angle, and if you lay straight to avoid the velcro, then your spine is curved. If you have to pee in the middle of the night, good luck birthing yourself out of the bottom of the thing, hoping you left your shoes in the perfect spot to drop your feet into. I'll carry an extra pound or two for a tent any day."

CampingandHiking,3a87k8,antarcticgecko,3,Thu Jun 18 00:12:27 2015 UTC,"Haven't done those two, but judging by the trail stats it looks like Guadalupe Peak is actually steeper than Half Dome, on average.  The kicker with Half Dome is that it's much longer, with some insanely steep sections. Think knee high steps going up alongside waterfalls, twice. Followed by some steep switchbacks and an exposed climb up granite. Then there's the cable section.  If I had to rate it on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the hardest hiking I've ever done, I'd give it a solid 8. The cumulative distance and elevation change is pretty brutal if you're not used to hiking long miles and elevations."
CampingandHiking,3a87k8,hi_in_fiber,3,Thu Jun 18 01:28:04 2015 UTC,"Half Dome's hiking route gains 4,800' over 7-8 miles (one way) culminating in the famous 400' vertical finish to a summit at 8,839'. All of that adds up to make it a bigger gain and longer trek than the easy routes for either trails you listed but at less gain / mile if you were to average out the climbs (not that mountains are even).   Conditions are straight forward dirt and rock up until you hit the crux which is usually solved with sturdy gloves, good steps and being ok with exposed heights. Water is limited so you're carrying more than on many other hikes. Shade is sparse (upside of very early starts) and summer temps are brutal. Lots of crowds to navigate past too.  What's this all mean? I hate to be that person but relative ratings are really tough to call out. I tell my friends it's no joke and nothing to be casual about. The hike is listed as difficult to very difficult but certainly not crazy, nor is it the biggest hike in Yosemite by any stretch. It's not as steep overall but is going to have sections that are the same, worse and easier all mixed in. Many fit people don't make it up from the combination of heat, gain and distance even though they've climbed elsewhere. That said, plenty of ""normal"" people do 4,000'+ climbs weekly and it's a long but fun day.  That said, the hardest part of the hike is likely going to be getting a permit. Most are given out via a lottery process that's long since over for the year leaving you to try for one of the ~50 daily permits or a backpacking permit which is still limited but often less competitive (of course you need the right gear for that too). http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/hdpermits.htm"
CampingandHiking,3a8nbx,Infamise,2,Thu Jun 18 02:30:23 2015 UTC,"That sounds really freaking cool! I can't answer all of it, but here is my two cents.  First and foremost, break in your hiking boots! Walk around in them; get used to them. Develop some blisters and callouses. It is way better to get them now rather than later when you want to enjoy yourself.   Secondly, get a good pack and get used to it. The general minimum is to have one with hip straps. If you don't have a good place to practice then you can ""hike"" around the block a few times daily. Yeah, you're going to look stupid. But it's way better to break it in now when you can fix it easily.  The external vs internal frame is a personal choice. I prefer the internal frame, but there's nothing wrong with external. Just like a walking stick: I don't care for them, but there's nothing wrong with them and if you like it then go on son.  You can bring Crystal Light or the like if you want. I personally wouldn't, but if bringing it with you is the right choice for you then it's the right choice for you. It's not wrong or anything.   Gortex is a great brand.  Dear Lord, the simple biggest things:   Toilet paper Feet Ziploc bags   You can go without any of them -- or neglecting them. But it's probably going to cause you to have a bad time. I'd add extra batteries if you had electronic devices. Follow their advice about socks. They're giving it for a reason. Plus ziplock bags are basically weightless and can make near anything waterproof, and I would take coming home with extra TP 10/10 times rather than running out.  When it comes to wading the river I would just suck it up and shiver and curse and dry off after. But there's nothing wrong with wanting to put on a pair of waders or whatever.  All of the instructions seem good! I'm guessing that they've done this before :-p"

When I opened the luggage, they pointed to the cookset and I realized right away that I had a full fuel can in there.  Didn't even think about it when I was packing, the fuel can just always lives inside my cookset. They took it and told me I could pay to have it shipped somewhere and then let me on my way.

CampingandHiking,3a506r,ST00PKlD,2,Wed Jun 17 15:41:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry I'm a novice, but I thought you had to pay for the rescue. Just like when you call an ambulance to take you to the hospital...right?"
CampingandHiking,3a506r,DRHdez,2,Wed Jun 17 15:48:42 2015 UTC,"It varies from state to state but usually you are not billed for SAR which are largly volunteer based in many places. In large part because it 1.) detours people from calling when the actually need it because they are afraid of a bill and  2.) can lead to friends/family who may attempt to go perform a rescue themselves, which can then lead to another person being lost/stuck/injured needing rescue.  However while in most places you will not be charged for SAR coming out, finding you, and dragging you out of the woods, if you need an ambulance, medivac, or other such service, you still have to pay for that, helicopter fuel isn't free.  Also from a liability standpoint, many places use outdoor recreation as a major source of revenue and they advertise the life out of it. Not having funds appropriated to rescue when you advertise potentially dangerous outdoor activities would be negligent, and the cost of a handful of rescue operations each season in comparison to the revenue these activities can generate is a drop in the bucket."

However, I don't think that is the case for rangers, firefighters, etc. Some states have ""stupid people"" laws that require people to pay for their own rescue (ie, in Arizona during monsoon, if you drive through flooded areas and get stuck you have to pay for your rescue). Not all states do this though."

I would love to move to Colorado but I keep hearing about the mortgage interest rates increasing and houses tripling in value all over the state.  If anything I would buy a run down home 45 minutes outside of Denver and fix her up myself. I don't want to be spending more than 1200 on a mortgage per month...  I live on Long Island and interest rates right now are INSANE. You're looking at between 2.5k and 3k for a fucking house that's completely run down and falling apart...the market is insane here on the island, well in the city its fucking crazy too."

CampingandHiking,3a1za7,if_ewe_only_gnu,5,Tue Jun 16 16:34:24 2015 UTC,What happened that you had to survive?
CampingandHiking,3a1za7,kasper3,23,Tue Jun 16 21:22:34 2015 UTC,"Because there was still so much snow in the mountains (much later in the year than usual) we lost the trail on the first day and had to go on with just a map and compass. The rangers told us we were the first ones to attempt it this season. Long story short, 2nd excruciatingly difficult day and although we tried our best to find the safest and most doable route to the pass we were navigating to, we ended up in a situation where going down from where we were was no longer an option with 50lb packs (too steep and icy as the sun was on the other side of the mountain and the melt had started to freeze), and going further up was both daunting from a physical standpoint and could potentially put us in an even more dangerous place. We'd taken a break on an outcropping of rocks we came across where we could collect our thoughts and rest. We'd just run out of water because it had ended up taking way longer than planned and was much harder in snow shoes without a trail, and the sun was starting to set. He was parched, exhausted, and frankly terrified. I was a bit of all that too but tried not to let it show. We decided that I would go on without a pack to scout options.  So I took a walkie-talkie and left him to rest. He was doing an incredible job keeping his composure given the scenario. I climbed on higher to get a lay of the land. There was too much unknown about what waited ahead if we were to continue to the other side, plus I didn't know how far we'd make it with no water, so I found the safest potential route down I could. Kept contact with him via walkie the whole time and he was keeping his cool. I made my way back to him and had him leave his pack on the rocks so he could climb without it. I took mine and we hiked to a place he could wait while I went back for his. Retrieved the pack and climbed back to join him.  Although our new route was better than where we'd been, it was still too steep to hike down with packs in snow shoes. They're great for going up but not so much for going down. There was a river at the base of the mountain and that was our target. We could get water, set up camp for the night, and recuperate. We agreed on what we thought was the best way to get there. We put our pack covers on our packs, each tied with some nylon cord for towing, and laid them on their backs. We then inflated our sleeping pads to use as sleds and got situated for the ride down. After that we just dug our heels in to keep from going uncontrollably fast and slid to safer ground, our packs sliding behind us. At one point we had to lower our packs down a steep ledge and climb down to them. After that we were able to tow them to the river and set up camp. We both slept for 12 hours in the tent that night. A sleeping bag never felt so good.   That kid never let his fear or physical exhaustion stop him from doing what had to be done to make it, even though closing his eyes and trying to just wish it away sounded so much better. He held it together, dug as deep as he could, and made it out. And he learned what he never thought he was capable of and now can't wait until the next time.   He survived the cold, the sun, the thirst, and the extreme fatigue. But so much more than any of that, he survived his own fear.   [Edit: spelling]"
CampingandHiking,3a1za7,MachinatioVitae,7,Tue Jun 16 22:43:24 2015 UTC,We then inflated our sleeping pads to use as sleds     That... is pretty fucking epic actually. That's some Indiana Jones shit right there.

It was the 26-mile Four Pass Loop at the Maroon Bells in the White River National Forest in Colorado. Absolutely incredible. Would definitely recommend it. We're planning a 30-mile loop in Big Bend National Park in Texas this fall. A little closer to home (we're Texas boys)."
CampingandHiking,3a1za7,The_High_Life,2,Wed Jun 17 01:36:53 2015 UTC,"So if my husband and I are looking to do this trail in about 3 weeks, are we screwed? Or do you think most of the snow will be gone by then, making the trail passable?"
CampingandHiking,3a1za7,rungiraffe9,0,Wed Jun 17 15:25:31 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of melt happening (which makes the rivers harder to ford) so I think it will be much better. The rangers said they expected it to be doable in early July. I'd try to build in an extra day though just in case it takes longer than expected, and know that you may end up needing snow shoes. We rented some in Aspen and wouldn't have have made it even half as far as we did without them. They also require hard-sided bear canisters now. We rented one of those there too because we'd planned for bear bags."

CampingandHiking,3a1za7,The_High_Life,0,Wed Jun 17 18:08:01 2015 UTC,I rented them from Ute Mountaineer in Aspen. http://www.utemountaineer.com/rentals-repair/aspen-alpine-touring-cross-country-ski-rentals/   For the two of us for four days it ended up being about $180 for the show shoes and the bear keg. Probably more expensive than other places but it was the only thing around.

It is complicated and cumbersome to use. As for the others, I would go try them on with some weight in them. While you're at it, try on some other brands too. As long as it is big enough to stuff all your gear in, what is most important is how your shoulders, back, and hips are going to feel after hauling it around with 20ish lbs in it for a few days."

The plan was to hike into Canyon Creek Meadow on the first night, then backtrack and camp at booth lake on the second. After hearing that the PCT in fact had no snow we changed plans and decided to do the whole loop. Unfortunately water and campsites were few and far between on the PCT so we ended up doing the leg in one day making the trip and overnight.  A word of caution to anyone who wants to hike the loop (And I would recommend it) there is a lot of blow down between Booth and Jack lakes. It slowed progress significantly, at one point we were climbing over down trees every 100-200'."

If there was a ""right"" answer, there'd just be the one shoe on the shelf, because it was ""the best"".  Personally, meshy trail runners for me, 99% of the time.  Other folks like big burly, waterproof boots.  As long as your feet are happy, all good."

CampingandHiking,3a5zeo,freedomweasel,3,Wed Jun 17 15:17:10 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  I could tell you the shoes that fit me perfectly, and the next person who responds could say that they felt terrible, crunched their toes, let their heel slip out and didn't have enough cushion.  They'd then mention a shoe they love, and another person comes in and says how much they hate it.  As long as you go to an actual gear store and not a walmart-type place, you'll be looking at quality options, and then you just get what fits the best.  You could go try stuff on and then buy cheaper online, but I'm not really a fan of that.  Generally I buy from the store that helped me, and then order my next few pairs online.  You can also order a mess of shoes from a website with easy/free returns, and just send back all but the one pair you like best.  All in all though, yes, I'd strongly suggest you try on a bunch of shoes."

The bigger and burlier you go, the more expensive they generally are.  If you don't need them immediately, keep an eye out for sales.  The last pair of my runners were only $40 because they were an old color."
CampingandHiking,3a5zeo,GoonCommaThe,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:54:56 2015 UTC,"It really comes down to preference.  I have two different pair of Keen boots I wear (one for summer, the other for winter) and have trail running shoes for when I am running or hiking without a pack (when I have a pack on low-tops seem to mess with my ankles).    If you are unsure I would recommend you get a pair of mid-top light hikers with a plate in the sole, and maybe shoot for some level of water resistance and breathability.  For example, I hike in the Keen Targhee II.  A boot like that (many companies offer the same set of features) offers some ankle support, is light weight enough that you don't feel like you had 5 extra pounds at the end of the day, provide sole protection with a plate, are wide enough to help avoid rolling and ankle, and provide traction.  Just to be clear I love my Keen boots, but they aren't for everyone.  There are many great boot companies, so the key is to look for the features you want and try some on."

I guarantee someone will suggest ""Training for the New Alpinism"" by Steve House.  People swear by it and it looks very interesting to me, but I don't have personal experience with it.   You should def hike Washington in the fall, but you should also be doing as much hiking as possible.  Multiple day trips in the Catskills and especially in the White Mountains will help with your fitness, if that's a concern.  I would highly recommend going up Mt Washington in the winter, at least 1x, to get accustomed the alpine environment.  It's pretty easy up until treeline and then it depends on the weather. It could be a nice long walk on some snow/ice, or it could be like a frozen but beautiful version of hell, like the day I tried to go up last winter.  Highly recommend it, no sarcasm implied.

CampingandHiking,3a5wkw,taymanblock,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:38:38 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that it's questionable if you can do any training that specifically helps your body adapt to higher elevation.  For Rainier, it's more important to have your base conditioning in place. The usual format for the main guided trips is: going up to Muir, spending a day practicing skills, and then summiting. Getting up to Muir, you usually have 50-60 lbs of gear. Less for going to the summit, but you are in mountaineering boots, crampons, harness, roped up for the glacier crossing, etc.  http://www.summitpost.org/mount-rainier/150291 has lots of good info, but you're looking at doing 9k of elevation gain (and more with the training day) with gear/weight. That's a lot, and I would worry more about that then the altitude.  Good luck! I might be doing rainier next year as well."
CampingandHiking,3a4zjy,suprnn,3,Wed Jun 17 07:17:50 2015 UTC,"I've visited and spent time in Sequoia, but never camped there. But, as someone who has planned and managed countless camping trips among friends, here are some items that always get left behind.   Fire starters - I am not sure how good you (or someone in your party) is at starting fires, but for beginners having a starter log can be very helpful. Sources of light - first time campers never seem to remember that headlamps and lanterns are necessities at night. I tend to pack a couple of extra, cheap headlamps to make everyone's lives easier Lounge chairs - you don't want to be that fool having to lug a rock while all your buddies are rocking out on their comfy Walmart chairs.  Cooking related stuff - cooking utensils, paper towels, eating utensils get left behind a lot Trash bag - this is my personally most forgotten item. Sequoia should have a bear box to keep these in, but you need to take them first. Camp shoes - When you're not hiking, lugging around your boots can be annoying.  Camp games - deck of cards, Cards against humanities, whatever Extra camp gear - so once again, I don't know how experienced y'all are but when I take noobs car camping, I usually take any extra sleeping bags or pads that I have. I had a friend go camping with me in January (Texas I guess, but it still went down to high 20's) that didn't bring his own pad.

CampingandHiking,3a4zjy,a_wild_ian_appears,2,Thu Jun 18 07:37:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say go to lodgepole if you can. It's further up the road and higher elevation. The Twin Lakes Trail begins right at Lodgepole and you are just a short drive or hike to the Lakes Trail (which is awesome), General Sherman and Moro Rock. Also, it won't be as hot as Potwisha because you are about 4,000 ft higher in elevation. If you go Lodgepole, I'd suggest trying to snag one of the campsites in the 96-144 loops (campsite numbers). Almost everything in the 151-214 loop is pretty crammed together and you feel like your neighbor is camping with you. Make sure everything scented goes in the bear box. Each campsite in lodgepole should have a bear box already, if not there is usually communal ones scattered around. Last time I was in that area, we saw 8 different bears while out on a day hike."

Smaller dogs usually have a hard time on tough trails, and bigger dogs take up too much room and need too much food.  I always thought that about chihuahuas too, but my buddy's dog Wiggles tears it up.  We go on 6-10 mile days no problem.  She's only on leash here because she can get a little barky around other people:  https://www.flickr.com/photos/14883031@N03/15130948517/in/album-72157647473455017/  That being said, I don't think this is normal chihuahua behavior."
CampingandHiking,3a4ibz,GoNorthYoungMan,4,Wed Jun 17 05:20:19 2015 UTC,"Actually chihuahuas are surprisingly athletic little beasts for what's normally considered to be a house/lap dog.  One of mine can easily jump onto chairs and other furniture and can walk all day as long as there's an occasional break.  The barky part is pretty normal though, just seems to be part of the breed temperament.  Like all dogs it really depends upon the owner so I'd say your buddy likes to hike and so does Wiggles."
CampingandHiking,3a4ibz,pto892,3,Wed Jun 17 12:13:54 2015 UTC,"Australian Shepherd, Australian Cattle Dog, Rat Terrier, Labrador, and medium-sized mixed breeds are among the best outdoor dogs I've known. Almost any breed that has a history of being used for ranching and herding: they're rugged and can handle long days outdoors, and are obedient."
CampingandHiking,3a4ibz,Lousy_Chemist,3,Wed Jun 17 05:46:57 2015 UTC,"Some advice on what sort of dog to not get for hiking:  Anything with a short nose/flat face (ie, pug/bulldog/shih tzu/boxer).  They often have breathing issues that make it hard for them to exert themselves for extended periods.  I'd also say to get something big enough that it can get over most obstacles by itself, but small enough that it won't drag you off a cliff when it sees a bird and you can pick it up without too much difficulty if you need to.  My fiancee has a houndy/lab-ish/who knows what else mutt.  Skinny, long legs, weighs about 40 lb.  I think she's about the perfect physique for a hiking dog, but she's too curious to be trusted off-leash.  Also, dark colored dogs do well in the winter, but less well in the summer, for obvious reasons."

We were going to state parks once every week or so, but it's too hot now. She's even hiked with me Arkansas. They're super energetic and go until their feet start bleeding. The best part though is that dalmatians are dirt proof and don't smell. She goes in water and mud and only gets a bath once or twice a year. She never stinks and I get tons of comments on how white she is. When hiking with friends and their dogs, they don't let them get wet or muddy because they stink. The only caveat is the shedding. They shed a lot.   http://imgur.com/tzsKHUU"

What are your experiences?"
CampingandHiking,3a4ibz,shorthairedlonghair,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:22:39 2015 UTC,"My experience with beagles has been mixed.  My first was a great hiking companion.  My second can't go for ten feet without having to check out a scent, which drives me crazy when I just want to walk.  I'd guess a big sporting breed would be good.  Watch out for breed-specific maladies like hip dysplasia though."
CampingandHiking,3a4ibz,retreadz,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:49:53 2015 UTC,"Also in the PNW.  Pretty much every kind of dog you'll see in the area, you'll also see on the trails.  Temperament and how well trained they are will matter more than any breed specific traits I can think of.  I have a lab/hound mix, short/medium coat, ~85 pounds.  He does great, but a lot of that is because he doesn't try to go tearing after every critter (or stick, or scent, sound or ""oooh shiny!"") he comes across.  The shorter coat is easier to keep clean on the trail and his size is still in the realm of easy to pack food/water for, but dogs in the 30-60 pound range probably fit that last ideal easier.  I can't think of a specific breed that would be ""horrible"" to hike with, though I would set a size limit based on what you are comfortable with potentially carrying.  Its great when dogs can carry some of their own gear, but ultimately we are responsible for their needs and sometimes that might involve carrying all they need and possibly even them if they get injured, sick or too exhausted."

It seems almost cruel to expect breed with breathing issues to keep up with a healthy human.  At the end of the day, I suspect training is more important than breed, so long as the breed is physically capable of the terrain."
CampingandHiking,3a4ibz,taymanblock,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:33:51 2015 UTC,"As long as you condition the dog to the hiking over time, most non-brachycephalic breeds will be fine (someone mentioned below, bulldogs, boxers, etc). I have a 50/50 German Shorthaired Pointer/Pitbull, and she started hiking around 5 months when the vet said it was ok.  She's now about 65lbs, and multiple 10-18 mile days are no problem.  And, because she's been doing it since she was young, she's now very accustomed to longer, very steep, rocky, muddy, whatever type of hikes.  She's just happy to be out there.   She also carries her own pack when we are out for multiple nights, and we conditioned her with that too.  You just need to start light and build up, not exceeding 1/3 of their body weight, according to what I've read.  Even still, we try not to exceed 1/4 of her weight, although she's strong as hell."

CampingandHiking,3a4ibz,blueceiling,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:31:13 2015 UTC,A well trained dog is going to be the best obviously.  But right out of the box herding dogs are good because they have a low prey drive and will generally stick by your side instead of chasing a rabbit to nowhere.  Australian cattle dogs rule for outdoor adventures

I think any of the herding dogs are going to be great.  A pure husky I'm not so sure since they tend to just pick a direction and run off.   Thankfully my mixed breed dog will do that until she starts to lose sight of me then makes a loop back to the trail.  The only issue is I can't take her with me in warm weather when water sources are scarce unless I want to carry a lot of extra weight.   I think that is going to be an issue with any larger dog breeds though."

CampingandHiking,3a3zy3,ohyouknowmewell,3,Wed Jun 17 01:28:40 2015 UTC,"First off, by hydration packs do you mean a bladder with a tube and bite valve or just the bladder?  Personally, I carry two 1 liter smart water bottles, and a 2 liter Evernew water bladder. I generally use the bladder and a Sawyer mini filter to fill my bottles. I try to keep both bottles full as much as possible and if there will be a stretch where I can not get water I will fill the bladder so I have 4 liters of water on me. My total capacity for carrying water also changes depending on the trail I will be hiking and the availability of water.   That is the system that works best for me, I find I drink more water if I am using bottles rather than bladders and I find that the system scales up well by adding additional bladders if needed.   Lastly, if you will have room is pretty dependent on how much other gear you are carrying and the size of said gear."
CampingandHiking,3a3zy3,MotoFox,2,Wed Jun 17 02:07:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry I guess I meant bladders with tube and bite valve.  I think I am going to go with a 2L or 3L bladder (with valve), and carry 2 additional 1L bottles on either side of my bag. I also have the sawyer mini filter and there should be plenty of water sources to fill the bottles.  Thanks for the info, very helpful and I appreciate it."
CampingandHiking,3a3zy3,freedomweasel,2,Wed Jun 17 02:30:14 2015 UTC,"If there are plenty of water sources, there's really no need to carry 5 liters of water.  Feel free to do what you want of course, and you can always just dump it out, but that's a lot of water and bottles/bladders to lug around.  Not sure where you live, but around here I've never carried more than 2 liters at a time."
CampingandHiking,3a3zy3,Leon_Trout,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:45:09 2015 UTC,"I think the ""if"" is important here.  I almost got into trouble on a short 7 mile hike in the Ozarks a few summers ago. I started with 2 liters and used it freely,  giving some to the dog, splashing it on my face, etc.    Well there was more elevation change than I thought,  it was pretty hot and the three tributary creeks on the map that I was counting on were bone dry, so I ran out.  I was definitely well onto dehydration when I got to the main creek that still had water and dehydration for me means blurred/double vision.  I could have tripped age sprained an ankle or took a wrong turn pretty easily.  So just be careful. When things start to go wrong, they can escalate very quickly.   I guess the moral of the story is to know the trail well,  know what your body needs and the conditions call for and manage your water carefully, especially in the summer."

CampingandHiking,3a3zy3,travelinzac,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:53:10 2015 UTC,"32 oz of water weighs a little less than 2 and a half pounds, so the less water that you are carrying at any given time the better. If you will have access to water sources throughout the entire hike, then ideally you would go with just one water bottle and refill it every time it gets emptied, lakes and streams permitting. If your route has fewer and further between water sources, then a hydration pack is a good idea. It's all about how often you'll be able to fill up. Only carry excess amounts of water if the only water available is what you are carrying."

CampingandHiking,3a3ewf,Tilt23Degrees,2,Tue Jun 16 22:34:16 2015 UTC,"Unless you are 100% sure that the weather will be perfect you will want some kind of a shelter, this could be as simple as a silnylon tarp to sleep under. You will also need a sleeping pad, if you lay with your sleeping bag directly on the ground not only will the bag get very dirty very quick but you will also be pretty cold due to heat loss to the ground.   As for water filtration I like the Sawyer Mini, it is simple and light. I will often carry Aquamira drops as backup. With the Sawyer mini you could even put it in line on your drinking tube, though I will say I have never done this and am not sure how easy it would actually be to drink out of.  For emergency gear if you are going to be hiking in an area that is known for large bear populations you could go with one of those options. If not, just practice good food management. Keep all food in one bag with any food trash or other items that may smell like food. Then make sure to hang your food bag at least 200' from camp. There are some good youtube videos that detail how to hang a food bag, personally I prefer to hang my bag PCT style.   I find that a simple headlamp is all I need to light around camp at night. You can hold it like a flashlight, wear it while hiking or setting up camp, or hang it in your tent to provide light to change, get into bed, or read.  If you want to use a stove I have always liked MSR Pocket Rocket stoves and GSI Halulite cook pots. Something in the 1 liter size range seems to be perfect for me.  As far as food if you are not yet an adept camp chef you can always buy freeze dried meals from a company like Mountain House, Packit Gormet, or Backpackers Pantry. For me, in order to save money, I like to eat Knorr pasta or rice sides for dinner, for lunches I will pack tortillas and some peanut butter or instant dried hummus. I also like to make sure I have two or three easy to eat snacks for throughout the day, for this I like different bars and trail mixes.   For water I carry two liters on my person at all times with the ability to carry four. I will stop and filter water when available and needed, if I come to a stretch where there will be little water I will often pack some extra just to be safe."

CampingandHiking,3a3ewf,hawk3ye,2,Wed Jun 17 13:14:26 2015 UTC,"Headlamp or a Luci lantern...the lantern lasts 8 hours on a full charge and I don't see the point in a headlamp unless you plan on hiking into the night.    The Sawyer filter bags that come with the unit are okay but a cheap reusable plastic water bottle is better imho since it fills fast than that stiff Sawyer bag and it's just as squeezable and lightweight.  Also the mini isn't very fast with water output, the slightly larger version of the filter puts out water faster - just something to keep in mind if you are trying to fill a large hydration pack.  I like Mountain House backpacking foods...they're tasty but if you plan on burning a lot of calories, I suggest adding stuff to them because other than providing a nice hot tasty meal, they don't seem to provide a lot of calories.  Bear spray is kinda over doing it but I don't know where you're going so you may want to ask the local ranger station what they think. I tend to bring a small pepper spray only for the two legged kind of predator...."
CampingandHiking,3a3ewf,JayPizzl3,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:17:35 2015 UTC,Hammock if the area allows for it and weather permits. Small High Calorie food like trail mix. Bring a candy bar too its always so good. Some bag mashed potatoe mix is always yummy. Trust me you wont want to carry 3 liters of water. Buy a sawyer mini water filter and fill up your water bottle with it whenever you can. Defintely a FLashlight. I prefer a lantern since i hang it from my hammock for some light while hanging in a circle at night with friends.

Not as bad as shrimp or shark, except bluefin, which is possibly worse since it's being driven to extinction, but still bad. Of course there's Mercury to worry about too. Otherwise this is fine  Edit: ok not too many people here trying to eat sustainable. I'm not making a judgment, just providing info."

CampingandHiking,3a1q0k,bosho15,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:46:56 2015 UTC,"I actually do care about sustainability because I want my last meal to be raw tuna. I hope that something can be done to make this fish last and not have the price go through the roof. However, I'm not going to stop eating it to sustain it. If there is a replacement you can suggest, I'm open, but it has to be able to be eaten raw."
CampingandHiking,3a1q0k,dangerousdave2244,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:35:49 2015 UTC,"Actually you probably don't have to avoid Tuna at all, you just have to be selective about what kind and how it was caught. The grocery stores you go to might not have the sustainability ratings shown (only whole foods and some specialty stores do), but if it says what kind of Tuna and where it was caught (and how it was caught if possible), you can use the Seafood Watch app to see if it is sustainable (green or yellow) or unsustainable (red). Seafood fraud is rampant unfortunately so the less information available the more likely it is unsustainable or not even Tuna, so choose places that will have the info you need"
CampingandHiking,3a1q0k,Krilesh,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:39:04 2015 UTC,Reallylike sushi. Never cooked rice outside of the rice cooker.  When you eat the tuna should it still be cold or room temp?   What happens if you cook rice on just the coals/fire? Too much?
CampingandHiking,3a1q0k,Krilesh,2,Fri Jun 19 16:15:09 2015 UTC,"First time I made camp sushi I did the rice over coals. The bottom stuck a bit but nothing too serious.  As far as eating it room temp, as long as it is vacuum sealed you are fine. The deep freeze kills everything you have to worry about. Just make sure that you don't break the seal until you are ready to eat."

Not sure of weather temperature in Yosemite at night, but I usually bring a northface at the very least when I camp just in case and got sitting around a late night campfire. Whistle. Sunglasses. Emergency blanket  Baby wipes, travek toothbrush/paste and hand sanitizer. I get the travel packs from the travel bins in Wal-Mart/target and they are super cheap and super light.   You have a very light pack, and I tend to over pack and like.having the hygiene/cleaning items to freshen before bed. Also, it seems like you would not be prepared for cold or inclement weather....but I'm not familiar with weather patterns and the elevation in Yosemite. Have fun and good luck!  EDIT: say no to cotton. I never bring cotton with me. If you get wet, it won't dry out and if the temperature drops, it can be downright dangerous.

CampingandHiking,39z73o,SirSpam28,2,Mon Jun 15 23:58:35 2015 UTC,"I'd look into doing Coyote Gulch in the middle of the Grand Staircase Escalate if you're gonna be here in the next 3 weeks or so.  After that, it starts to get a might bit toasty in the red rock country, so you might look for some elevation.  Boulder mountain is kinda smack dab in the middle of the National park area, and there are some interesting features up there.  It's not too long of a hike, but I like exploring around the Blind Lake/ Fish creek area.  If you are coming in late July/ August, I might suggest taking a crack at climbing Mount Ellen in the Henry Mountains.  From there you can look down on the Grand Staircase Escalante, Capitol Reef, and Canyonlands.  Most of these suggestions do assume that you will have a 4x4 vehicle at your disposal."

But its a whole different story when you have twigs and sticks. While I'm hiking I usually plan out how much wood I would need for a fire vs how long I want the fire to be. When I'm hiking with friends I want a nice good 8 hour fire. Which is really tough when you have small twigs. I've started to bring a 1-2 lb axe to cut up logs to make longer and bigger fires.

It was built in 1911 by the Western Maryland Railway, and is currently used by the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad, a tourist railroad running between Frostburg and Cumberland, Maryland, as well as the Allegheny Highlands Trail of Maryland (part of the Great Allegheny Passage rail trail).   Some had expressed concern regarding the dual use of the tunnel, but time has shown that the scenic railroad and the bicycle trail can peacefully co-exist.  The Allegheny Highlands Trail of Maryland is currently complete from Cumberland to near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, using mostly abandoned rail right-of-way. The portion of the trail from Cumberland to near Frostburg trail is adjacent to the active tourist line, including the tunnel.

When the weather is bad don't summit other then that I really don't think it's that bad. I think you can do it. It's just a little common sense don't climb the mountain with some of the worst weather in the world in a storm, I would rather climb that mountain on a nice day then many others. The trails are good and broken. Go for it"
CampingandHiking,39z3w0,zachopia,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:37:21 2015 UTC,Thank you. We are pretty pumped about climbing it so this is nice to hear.
CampingandHiking,39z3w0,walkalong,2,Wed Jun 17 01:31:59 2015 UTC,"It's a safe hike if you don't do stupid things. I hiked the Tuckerman Ravine trail when I was 10 and I was fine. Just do not go off the trail when you are climbing up the head wall and you're good. People die when they think it would be cool to go stand at the top of the waterfall a little ways off the trail. Just don't do that.   As for weather, that's a judgement call that you have to make during the hike. Be prepared (rain coat, many extra layers as it can get cold and wet and windy) and be smart. If you're wet and the temperature keeps dropping, it's probably best to turn around. But most of the time the weather is fine for hiking.   Just curious, you say you're doing it as a multi day trip so where would you be staying? Also, if it's a multi day trip you'll probably have time to check out Mt Monroe and Lakes of the Clouds Hut, which I would definitely recommend.  And if you really don't want to do Washington, there are tons of other mountains in the White Mountains that are great hikes. The Franconia Ridge, Adams/Madison, Jackson/Pierce, Kinsmans/Cannon to name a few."
CampingandHiking,39z3w0,walkalong,2,Tue Jun 16 16:14:15 2015 UTC,I think I am pretty convinced we will go through with it after reading up on it some more. We were planning on camping at a local park. I will definitely look into Mt. Monroe and Lake of the Clouds Hut. Thanks for the suggestions. And yeah I figured most of the weather related stuff is common sense. I've heard that people have gotten 700 ft from the top and had to turn around. Either way thanks for the response.
CampingandHiking,39z3w0,walkalong,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:30:23 2015 UTC,"We were planning on camping at a local park.   Dolly Copp by any chance? It's not far from the trail head.   I will definitely look into Mt. Monroe and Lake of the Clouds Hut.   Here is a map of the area around Mt Washington. You can see the Tuckerman Ravine trail coming in from the right. Lake of the Clouds Hut and Mt Monroe are just southwest of the summit of Washington. The hut is a fun place to stop for a snack/bathroom break/water fill up, and monroe is a quick hike up to a cool summit.   I figured most of the weather related stuff is common sense.    It is common sense, but also in a way isn't. It isn't in that the weather in the White Mountains can be far more severe than anywhere else people have hiked, so they just don't know what to do. Basically, respect the mountains. But of the many times I've hiked in the Whites, I've had to bail on my original plan once, so the odds are you'll be fine."
CampingandHiking,39z3w0,walkalong,2,Wed Jun 17 06:09:43 2015 UTC,Dolly Copp and Dry River were the one's I was looking into. Thank you for that map by the way.

CampingandHiking,39xz86,passingby,3,Mon Jun 15 18:34:12 2015 UTC,"Well the main thing I notice is the rainfly; the Half Dome has a full coverage rainfly. This means there's place to protect your gear and boots from rain, without having to have those items in the tent. If you're car camping, that doesn't really matter, but when you're backpacking, it's extremely important.  Also the full coverage rainfly supplies more protection from heavy storms, again, not that important if you're car camping."
CampingandHiking,39xz86,Freddiedie1,2,Mon Jun 15 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"In addition to that, weight. The half dome has all the extra features (full rainfly w/ vestibule is the most important) but still weighs a whole lb less.  OP, if you're just into car camping and just thinking of backpacking eventually, 1lb might seem kinda trivial. But trust me, by the time you take your pack off after the first backpacking trip, the prospect of ditching a whole lb of crap for the next time will sound incredibly wonderful. IF you were seriously into backpacking you'd eventually be lusting after the quarter dome, which drops another 1.5lb, but it gets pretty pricy. The half dome is a very popular mid-range option. The plain old dome is pretty bottom end car-camp-only, though at least it won't fall apart like a department store tent might."
CampingandHiking,39xz86,AngryT-Rex,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:37:55 2015 UTC,Excellent. That's great info. It looks like I'll probably go with the Half Dome and maybe upgrade to the Quarter in the future.

CampingandHiking,39xz86,velogeek,2,Mon Jun 15 23:15:32 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, you picked the wrong place to pitch the tent because it would soak into your tent as well.  The tent itself isn't waterproof (the rainfly is coated) and it'll eventually get through the floor.  ALWAYS pitch your tent in an elevated location... At least relative to the ground immediately surrounding it.  I've camped in a half dome 2 for the past 6 years and my pack has never been wet under the tent except by my own stupidity (make sure that door is sealed, kids)"
CampingandHiking,39xz86,GoonCommaThe,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:40:23 2015 UTC,I put my pack cover on and then just flip my back on its back.  Ideally you don't have much water flowing there though.
CampingandHiking,39xz86,pink_tea,2,Wed Jun 17 20:24:37 2015 UTC,"I don't have either tent, but am planning on buying the Half Dome 2 + eventually for backpacking. The Dome is much better suited for car camping, it does not have the standard features of a normal backpacking tent.  If you want to eventually use the same tent for backpacking I would suggest investing in the Half Dome, but your needs and my needs may be very different.  I would go into the REI store and look at the tents and ask their salespeople, they are very helpful."

CampingandHiking,39x5jl,pto892,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:44:19 2015 UTC,"Accurate trail data in gpx format is difficult to find.  /u/Aldinach has already covered the easiest way to get free trail data, but from my experience the data on that map set is hit or miss.  I've found that the trail alignment can often be off by quite a bit in places-sometimes hundreds of feet.  However, it's also quite accurate in other places and the price can't be beat.  Garmin sells their own sets of topo maps which are quite pricey.  The 24K maps are excellent though and have routable trail data-in other words the GPS can be used to route you on a trail, tell you where the turns are, and so on very similar to using a vehicle GPS.  Also look at openstreetmap.org for trail data, some of the user supplied data there is very accurate and updated frequently.  There's a whole bunch of differing software tools that you can use to get that data onto your GPS, it's also possible to make your own custom topo maps using open and public data.  See the tutorial at GPSFiledepot on how to do this-it is possible to make your own if you like."

CampingandHiking,39x5jl,pto892,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:27:58 2015 UTC,Thanks everyone for the great info. I think this search is activating my marketing brain: Doesn't it seem like the NPS and state parks should offer gpx info for their system. My thought is that they are out on the trails maintaining them anyway and it wouldn't be difficult to equip them with a gps and edit the data.   My other thought is that Garmin would want to give this info as well. You could still use alltrails to trade info on routes but for safety reasons wouldn't you want to be sure people could easily find their way?

CampingandHiking,39xtep,VolatileAngel,3,Mon Jun 15 17:54:40 2015 UTC,"Take it worth a grain of salt, what works for me might not work for you but here is what I see:  Sharing a pad/bag will likely be uncomfortable and depending on conditions quite cold. I hope you are both capable of maintaining an embrace through the entire night without moving.  Note that using a wrap around windscreen with a canister stove is an explosion hazard.  That stanly cookset is a pound and a half by itself, plus 2 aluminum bowls? Reusable Tupperware bowls (you can get free with some lunch meats or buy really cheap in a set) weigh an ounce and have a sealing lid.  I would recommend a headlamp for each of you. much better than one of you having to rely on a dinky flashlight.  Paracord stretches and absolutely sucks for hanging packs and bear bags. I much prefer some small diameter static cord. Ditch the carbiners, learn to tie some knots, you still have to tie a knot with a carabiner anyways. Figure-8 follow through with a yosemite finish and a tauntline on a bight is what I use to hang my bear bag, as simple as it gets.  Imodium is the most important part of a first aid kit, make sure its in there. And pack extra TP. It's to light not to.  An old gift card or hotel key is great for wrapping duct tape around, then you can put it where it will stay dry till you need it.  Filling water bladders with a sawyer squeeze sucks. I find smart water bottles superior. And unless water access is a concern I wouldn't carry 2.5-3l of water anyways.  Extra Day Bags, Meh why not just compress down your packs. Do your day bags hold your water bladders? Or are you taking bottles as well? In which case why take the bladders?  Hammock + straps is over 2 pounds, The Rainfly close to another pound. Basically carrying a full second shelter system."

I will look into the cord you're talking about, i was worried about that but wasn't sure of an alternative. And I will learn me some knots. Imodium - Check Extra TP- Check great idea on the duct tape, I will do this water is a bigger concern (not a lot of clean drinking water options around the island) though we have both hydration packs we may just fill my 3L and bring a plastic water bottle + sawyer. Opinions on that? I love my day bags (use them every day basically) so I didnt even consider not bringing them, but you make a good point about the water, will probably follow your advice. I want whoopie slings, but I don't know how to make them. :( Will get my boyfriend on that. He loves the hammock and bringing it would be a nice fun/relaxation item for him. The tarp is ONLY if it will be very rainy then we can cook under it or hang under it."
CampingandHiking,39xtep,travelinzac,2,Mon Jun 15 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"If it's tested and works I can't hate.  Using a windscreen that wraps around the stove and canister can cause excess heat build up and the canister to explode. There is even a warning in the MSR Pocket Rocket Manual. There are some specially made windscreens for various stoves that only surround the burner and leave the canister open, these are safe, but the foil wrap around style is very dangerous.  The weight i found on amazon must have been wrong on the cook set. its not awful, cook sets just tend to get heavy quick so its always a place to be weary of what you are carrying, but that doesn't sound to bad.  All the modern filters are reliable for cleaning water. If you can find water you can filter it. But then I read /u/akasnacks reply and I'd maybe carry the extra water, though I'm sure I't wont hurt you haha."
CampingandHiking,39xtep,sandraver,2,Tue Jun 16 05:07:45 2015 UTC,Whoopie slings are amazing. Highly recommend.
CampingandHiking,39xtep,akasnacks,2,Tue Jun 16 05:28:39 2015 UTC,You will need more than a small tube of bug spray. Also the island is very very humid in the summer. Yankee is a decent site but there are a few prime spots to be had in it. My suggestion is to book it there as quick as you can to try and get the better spots. Also if you haven't been there before be prepared to have to change campsites. It has happened 2 out of the last trips 3 there. It is not a big deal but just keep it in mind. Okay and now for my biggest issue with the island. Water. The water is nasty. Very sulfuric in taste and smell. Especially your water source. We have started carrying our own water onto the island. Others may not have an issue with it but it is bad. The water comes from a spigot and the smell hits right away. Up to you but just wanted to let you know ahead of time. Another thing I do is carry baby wipes instead of TP. Personal preference.
CampingandHiking,39xtep,akasnacks,0,Tue Jun 16 01:55:33 2015 UTC,"Do multiple people crowd into the primitive spots? Not very cool if so.. I've always experienced primitive spots as being more secluded, is that not the case here?  Thank you for all the info! I'll grab more bug spray and carry the extra water."
CampingandHiking,39xtep,akasnacks,2,Tue Jun 16 12:05:56 2015 UTC,"The sites are more like mini campgrounds. They only allow certain number of people per site. I have been at Yankee when it was full and did not think it was too over crowded. Yankee Paradise is more open and thus more people cram into an area. However, most people do not take the time to explore the area very much. When you go into the site go to your right. You will see a faint trail which most think is the poop trail. In actuality there are some nice ""secluded"" spots back there. Once back there you will see an open area. Once there make another right and there is a spot that is most private spot available. It is small and you may have to kill some briers but it is probably the best spot there. Bikes are allowed only on the roads. You can take your bike and tie it to a tree then hike back. Brickhill Bluff is the only site you can bike into. You can walk back the beach and sometimes the people on the island will give you a ride. I have ridden with the drunk lawyer a couple of times."

CampingandHiking,39tbrc,kalimsnor,4,Sun Jun 14 15:59:57 2015 UTC,"For shaving weight: Shoes and sandals? I would personally just bring the sandals when I get to camp. Unless the temps are going to reach below freezing I would just bring thick water bottles, or buy platypus ones if you still want the protection, they are much lighter. I wouldn't bring a beard trimmer but that's more of a personal thing. If you really wanted to cut weight you could replace that axe spray by removing both the contents of a chap stick and deodorant, then putting the deodorant in the microwave and pouring the hot stuff into the chap stick and letting it dry in there for a mini deodorant. Are those jeans and a cotton sweatshirt? Those are going to be pretty heavy, and extremely heavy/uncomfortable if they get wet, if you have the money go for synthetic materials which are lighter and will dry much much faster. Everything else looks good to me, and everything I've seen from Norway has been beautiful, have fun."

If you can find some thin wool underwear, those are good, and will keep you warm even if you get wet, and you can change how much you wear easily. The weather here can be quite unpredictable, especially in the mountains on the west coast and in north Norway. We're having a pretty cold summer this year (at least so far). Still snowing on the mountains (above about 800 meters you can meet new snow if I remember correctly). Most likely it will be warmer in July, but be prepared for cold nights."

Now that that's out of my system, one cool game I learned from a friend was a word (in)completion game.  The first player says a letter, and each subsequent player adds a letter.  The object is to prevent a word from being completed: when you add a letter that completes the word, you lose.  The challenge is that you can't throw random letters into the mix: each letter you add has to be ""on the way"" to a word.  If a player suspects a nonsense word is under construction, he can challenge the last player who added a letter.  The challenger wins if the last player who added a letter can't produce a word matching the pattern in play (thereby admitting that there is no real word under construction), but loses if the string of letters is shown to be the start of a real word."

CampingandHiking,39sb7z,da_machine_girl,2,Sun Jun 14 10:58:12 2015 UTC,Looks like your ground tarp might be sticking out too far. You don't want it to catch water and funnel under your tent.
CampingandHiking,39sb7z,evandena,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:07:20 2015 UTC,"Looks like you had fun.  Just an FYI, though:  Camping above 3,500 feet is prohibited in the Catskills between March 21st and December 21st (basically any time outside of winter).  I believe that Hurricane Ledges is just barely above 3,500 feet.  The reason for this regulation is that the ecosystem (including soils and vegetation) at higher elevations in the Catskills is more susceptible to damage incurred by camping impacts.  Camping at higher elevations is permitted in winter because when the ground is frozen and covered in snow, there tends to be less issues with erosion and devegetation from camping impacts."
CampingandHiking,39sb7z,DSettahr,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:08:36 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for this. We actually had a hard time finding regulations beyond camping further than 150ft from the trail and source of water. We called the ranger center and they were very unhelpful and almost surprised we called.
CampingandHiking,39sb7z,DSettahr,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:41:19 2015 UTC,"For future reference, you can find the complete text of the NYSDEC State Land Use Regulations here:  http://www.dec.ny.gov/regs/2493.html  This page summarizes the most important regulations for backcountry camping (but note that it doesn't really cover special regulations that exist for specific areas, such as the High Peaks Wilderness):  http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/7872.html  The Adirondack Mountain Club (ADK) has a good page that summarizes the special regulations for the High Peaks Wilderness:  http://www.adk.org/page.php?pname=dec-regulations  Note that these are for NYSDEC lands only.  Lands under the jurisdiction of the NYS Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation (all State Parks and Historic Sites except the Adirondack and Catskill State Parks) have separate regulations."

I went down to my local REI last weekend to try out some sleeping pads, and I was planning on buying the XLite. Sadly they only had 1 of the 5 pads I wanted to look at in stock, so I'm going again tomorrow. Would you recommend the XLite?"
CampingandHiking,39rgl9,travelinzac,2,Sun Jun 14 04:06:23 2015 UTC,"Its a good pad! Very comfy, packs super small and is so so light! As a woman, I am a colder sleeper so maybe going with the women specific Xlite would have been more ideal than the unisex I have? I have wondered though if I should have gone with the Xtherm. Its a bit more money but a larger r-value. I would definitely try them both out!!"
CampingandHiking,39rgl9,Freddiedie1,2,Sun Jun 14 05:11:55 2015 UTC,The difference between the unisex and women's r value might be enough of a difference. A you can tell if the pad is doing its job if you're feeling cold when you sleep and it's coming from below you.
CampingandHiking,39rgl9,tonygerads,2,Sun Jun 14 08:12:22 2015 UTC,"Well I pulled the trigger! Bought the pad (and a new tent!) today, just tested it out and it's so much more comfortable than my old self inflating pad!

CampingandHiking,39pkgv,crappuccino,14,Sun Jun 14 01:05:08 2015 UTC,"I had my biggest garage sale pull last year. I was at the flagship store in Seattle and hadn't made it there until the afternoon. Usually that means slim pickings, but this time they had a different format. They were letting 50 people into a small area for 30 minutes and they would re-stock the arena between each wave.  Since I went in the afternoon they were trying to get rid of everything that had been left behind and they had way too much stock left too.   Everything was 75% off, all footwear was $5, and if you bought a sleeping bag you could get 2 pads for a penny each..  I got 2 pairs of scarpa mont blanc gtx mountaineering boots. absolutely no sign of wear, returned because they didn't fit well. ($1.43 each after tax)  1 pair of la sportiva evo gtx mountaineering boots, a little bit more worn, but in excellent condition ($1.43 after tax)  1 pair of Salomon S-Lab Sense 4 Ultra SG, no sign of wear ($1.43 after tax)  1 older Osprey Ozone convertible suitcase, 1 broken buckle ($35 ish)  1 REI Radiant 30F sleeping bag, no sign of wear ($10 ish)  1 REI flash sleeping pad, returned because it was ""too loud"" ($0.01)  1 REI camp X chair, no sign of wear ($5)  1 Lifeproof iphone case ($1)  My total after tax was $60!!

CampingandHiking,39tzfa,Frivilous_Hashtags,3,Sun Jun 14 19:25:48 2015 UTC,"That's actually called a stay. They are the frame portion of an internal frame pack that flex under weight to equally transfer the load in the pack to the hip belt. Without stays, all the weight would just be on your shoulders.   Your bent stay is shorter than the regular stay now. That means the weight of the pack is going to be focused on the regular stay side instead of evenly distributed. This will be uncomfortable and annoying.   If you are walking a mile or two in to set up a base camp, only going on one weekend trip, or have loaded it up and don't feel what the weight difference or the bar poking in your back, then just let it be. If you plan to do any serious backpacking with this pack, contact Kelty for a replacement stay.   Stays flex. So bending that piece of metal a few more times to attempt to match the factory curve and performance is not going to happen. You could lessen the weight discrepancy, but it will always be there."
CampingandHiking,39tzfa,sojournadjourned,2,Sun Jun 14 20:06:06 2015 UTC,"That helps a ton. Do you think Kelty would help in replacing it, despite being bought used from REI?"
CampingandHiking,39tzfa,sojournadjourned,2,Sun Jun 14 21:37:37 2015 UTC,"That stay looks like someone knelt or stepped on it. Kelty has a store room full of buckles, straps, stays, etc to replace defective gear. For Kelty to replace the part, it would be through a warranty or guarantee, which means you will need to swap out the stay on your own. Check their website for information, call the number, show enthusiasm for the product, and be honest where you bought it. With damage like that, any explanation you concoct is going to sound like bullshit, and warranty people don't give free stuff to people trying to con them. At most, you'll be paying for a replacement stay + shipping, which will still make this a great deal on a pack."
CampingandHiking,39tzfa,shuddertostink,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:49:12 2015 UTC,"Those are aluminum stays and most likely are intended to be bent to custom fit your back.

You'll have no problem; if it isn't meant to be bent to shape I'm sure they'll just mail you a new one or let you buy one cheap.  Congrats on the great find and have fun !"

It dosent sound like much but ive been to some campe sites where tents are almost on top of each other. Campsite 48 is the one i stayed at. Its large and on top of a hill. It rained so it was a great that the water ran away from the campsite. Sites 1 threw 25 are lame because there twords the frunt of the camp and cars are driving by all day long.
CampingandHiking,39t9h0,7777755555,5,Sun Jun 14 15:38:45 2015 UTC,Pay to take the first AM shuttle up to Glacier Point and then hike back down via the Paramona Trail.
CampingandHiking,39t9h0,somedude456,2,Sun Jun 14 17:35:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If you've never been to Yosemite this is a great introduction to the park. Glacier point gives an awesome view of the valley, as does the panorama trail.   You get 3 consistently present waterfalls and it's very doable as a day hike for a variety of hiking fitness levels.   You could take the 4 mile trail up to glacier, but it'll add a significant degree of difficulty on your day."
CampingandHiking,39t9h0,bobracha4lyfe,3,Sun Jun 14 19:06:47 2015 UTC,OP. Recommend getting a reservation for this plan.
CampingandHiking,39t9h0,meyerpw,2,Sun Jun 14 19:49:07 2015 UTC,"Good luck with getting much water this year. Maybe. Maybe not. It's awful dry now, and there won't be any relief by fall.  Yosemite Valley kinda lacks for hiking, but even without water it's a nice walk, if crowded, and you don't have tons of alternatives. I'd also vote for the Panorama Trail.  If you can get a permit Half Dome is fun."
CampingandHiking,39t9h0,211logos,2,Sun Jun 14 19:58:27 2015 UTC,"I think your source is a little misleading. 3 miles is the round trip from Happy Isles to the top of Vernal falls only. If you intend to go to the top of Nevada falls (would recommend, great views/photos) the round trip is closer to 5 mi. While 5 miles isn't huge, you're also tackling 2,000' of elevation gain (averages 14% grade, it's 2.5 miles of climbing stairs).  If you have the means to do more than day hikes, the trip out to 10 Lakes and back was fun. More than I'd try to accomplish in a day, there's a significant ridge climb right before the lakes. The trail was empty (early September 2014) and there will be water at the lakes.   Another option would be to head in to Glen Aulin and Waterwheel falls. This may be more doable as a day hike. Looking at my map (haven't actually done this one) you're looking at 20 miles round trip, but the elevation profile is much more gentle.   In either case, if you plan to stay a night in the back country, you must have a permit. We had no problem getting a 'day of' pass for 10 lakes, Glen Aulin will be harder.  Edit: something I forgot. I assume you'll probably end up on the mist trail at some point. When you find yourself on top of Nevada Falls, make sure to take a little detour down the John Muir Trail towards the valley. If you take it ~1/4 mile you'll get some excellent views of Liberty Cap, Mt. Broderick, and Half Dome. Worth the detour IMO.i don't recommend taking the JMT all the way down. It's boring and IMO just as painful as the most trail..."

Bring good food, drink a lot of water, and don't wait til the last minute to go... you have to find a good spot. I can tell you from experience, if you wait and you end up trying to bolt down a hill, you're going to end up having to just stop where you are.... Shitting on a hillside is hard. Very hard.

CampingandHiking,39ra3e,zorfbee,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:26:01 2015 UTC,You don't do it the day before you leave. Do it a couple weeks beforehand.
CampingandHiking,39ra3e,lellebebbl,2,Sun Jun 14 00:42:53 2015 UTC,"I do, actually. Strangely enough the only really hairy part of my body as well. Could you explain a little more in detail why this could cause any issues?"
CampingandHiking,39ra3e,zorfbee,2,Sun Jun 14 00:18:27 2015 UTC,I call it Star Trek butt. You end up being invaded by klingons. Meaning it gets all over the hairs and is more difficult to wipe.  I wouldn't shave it the day before you go or anything. That may cause a little stubble chaffing. Do it a week or two before you go.  Soak in a hot tub for awhile before you shave it it. It makes so much easier.
CampingandHiking,39ra3e,Oreganoian,2,Sun Jun 14 00:36:22 2015 UTC,I'd recommend against this actually.   If you aren't used to it you will get extremely itchy and the sweat feeling is...really fucking odd.

CampingandHiking,39ra3e,Oreganoian,4,Sun Jun 14 00:31:01 2015 UTC,Never outright shave your ass. Just don't. Get a beard trimmer/buzzer with a short guard(1/4 inch or so). I use mine for everything and it's amazing.

CampingandHiking,39ra3e,thatguyron,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:07:37 2015 UTC,"True, that's why I suggested flax seed. If it works for you, you will really only need to take a few grams with you to be set for the entire trip."

CampingandHiking,39s08v,Lemonadesmile,3,Sun Jun 14 04:45:36 2015 UTC,"If you want to do it, then it is a good idea as long as you properly prepare for it and know your boundaries. Following the training suggestions that others have already posted is a good start. You should also look at trail journals such as Postholer.com and trailjournals.com to get an idea of what others have encountered. Check out the PCTA (link below) and the AT equivalent. I would check out the ultralight subreddit as well as the associated trail subreddits as they have good information on getting your pack weight down and training for long distance hikes. I met plenty of people who had various issues, including several hikers over 60 years old, and a few severely obese people. Obviously it took them a bit longer, but they knew their limits. You need to consult with a doctor before going, do not rely on our analysis. If you take medication, you will need to make preparations for your prescriptions to be shipped out to you. I hiked the PCT alone, and met many others who were doing the same, including several women in your age group. They would often hike with a group here and there. Many of the women carried a SPOT to keep in touch with those at home. I personally would not carry a gun as it is extremely heavy and unless it is holstered on your hip, you are not likely to get it out of your pack before you encounter danger. You are also going through several jurisdictions that have varying regulations. If you are going to bring a weapon of any type, become comfortable with its use as well as the laws regarding its possession and use. I would recommend that you read this. Just remember that acting responsibly and cautiously is far more effective than carrying a weapon and weighs nothing."
CampingandHiking,39s08v,turn0,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:39:37 2015 UTC,Hey thank you!    I don't think I'd be comfortable with a gun. I probably will just make sure to keep my wits about me.    Also I appreciate the bit about hikers over 60. I haven't met very many young people who have to worry about training for a hike with a bum leg.   I'm will for sure do all the things you mentioned!
CampingandHiking,39s08v,krashmo,3,Sun Jun 14 15:05:44 2015 UTC,"Do not go on a multi-day hike, alone, on a long trail far from civilization for your first outing. People train for months to get ready for something like the PCT. In order to attempt something like that you need to be comfortable enough with your outdoor skills to handle all sorts of emergencies.   You should start with something much easier like a day hike with some friends. You don't have to be on a mountain trail to go hiking. You can just walk through a field or around a lake. Try camping out so you can figure out what gear you need and what is just dead weight. Read some books or blogs about backpacking. Learn how to read a map and start a fire. Buy a water filter and practice using it.  Going out solo with no experience is a great way to end up lost or seriously injured. Please do some research and get more experience before you try anything like the PCT."
CampingandHiking,39s08v,GrittyHandjob,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:14:57 2015 UTC,Don't worry I am! This is about two years from when I'm planning to do anything serious like that. Those trails are just the end goals.
CampingandHiking,39rz56,sashei,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:31:32 2015 UTC,"You might want to wear wool socks with regular hiking boots or shoes. Your feet are going to get wet one way or another -- in rain boots they're going to get wet from the inside (sweating) -- in regular boots they'll get wet from the outside.   Take one or two spare pairs of socks so you can have dry socks every day. Dry the wet socks out at night.  If you wear a rain jacket, make sure it has ventilation zippers. Again, you can get wet from the inside.  If it is warm enough, you might just forgo the rain gear and get wet.  Plastic bags inside the backpack gives you double protection. I would definitely put my dry clothes and electronics inside plastic bags."

CampingandHiking,39pmod,jhturbo,4,Sat Jun 13 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"I also started with some cheap Walmart poles that I used for a couple of years. I recently bought some Black Diamond Trail Shock Pro poles and am very impressed over how much better they are than the walmart poles. By the second hike the baskets on my walmart poles were gone, several times I had the locking mechanism on one of the poles give way causing the pole to collapse, and in general they were flimsy. I'm not knocking the walmart poles, they were a great value for the price I paid. The Black Diamond poles are just on a completely different level from a quality standpoint."
CampingandHiking,39pmod,U235EU,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:47:18 2015 UTC,I think it's worth pointing out however that the BD poles are several multiples the price of the walmart ones.
CampingandHiking,39pmod,shuddertostink,2,Sat Jun 13 23:57:59 2015 UTC,"Weight, reliability of locking mechanism, grip comfort.   It all boils down to the features you need and if you feel the price difference is worth it.  If you are hiking flat trials it doesn't matter as much; however, when relying on poles for step descents having faith in the locking mechanism is a bit more important."

CampingandHiking,39pmod,stoppage_time,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:49:17 2015 UTC,"Poles that you twist to collapse aren't very sturdy, especially in rough terrain.

But if you're gonna be hiking more than once or twice a month or for long periods of time, expensive ones are cheaper, more durable, and are usually more comfortable. Although, the main reason to buy expensive poles is durability."
CampingandHiking,39pmod,spoons1213,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:40:36 2015 UTC,I had a 20 dollar pair from Amazon that bent at a 45 degree angle.  I had only taken them on about 5 trips when this happened.  The pole was a bit mangled and it would then get stuck when you tried to collapse the pole.  I recently bought BD poles for a trip.  They're nice and I prefer the flick lock mechanisms.  The foam grips are nice too for using bare hands.  I think the quality just depends on how often you go hiking and if you are planning on backpacking.  Breaking poles on a backpacking trip wouldn't be fun.
CampingandHiking,39pmod,yungmermaidsnacks,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:43:18 2015 UTC,I've jammed my bd poles in some stuff that definitely should have broken them but they're still sticks and still straight. They've got a nice shock system and I can just trust them to hold me
CampingandHiking,39pmod,CascadeMTech,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:55:58 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to spend a little more, you'll save in the long run.

Cork handles will provide a nice grip while absorbing some of the shock.High-quality poles can be obtained for under $50 and last you several years."

CampingandHiking,39ngv5,kevinpdx,2,Sat Jun 13 01:08:05 2015 UTC,"This was a long(ish) day-hike. Not a ton of distance, but certainly good amount of elevation. My Garmin Etrex gps recorded 8.3mi over 7hrs- an overview can be seen here. Our total moving/ hiking time was 6hrs but since it was my friends first big hike in the Whites, we took 20 minutes or so at each summit and at the hut since the views were just incredible in every direction.   We weren't really too isolated, that was some fancy camera work on my part haha. There were maybe six or so people ascending via Falling waters, and much more so passing us the other way. In fact, we saw a group of 64 people (that's right, 64) hiking up from the other direction; it was mainly kids aged 10-15 interspersed with adults aged 30-40. Still, crazy to see such a long procession of people snake up the trail.   The hut is run and maintained by the Appalachian Mt. Club. They sell freshly baked goods - hmmmm brownies - as well as providing guests ($120 a night) with a cot, dinner, and breakfast. The caretakers are generally there for the summer months only, but these huts are dotted at various locations throughout the WMNF and some are open all 12 months. They're all really well constructed and a great spot to stop, refill waters, and sit out on the porch. The hut runs on solar/ wind energy.   I've done a lot of hiking in the Whites and this was easily top five for me in terms of getting a great workout, excellent variety and challenge to the trail, and just magnificent views."

CampingandHiking,39klhs,FuZhongwen,8,Fri Jun 12 15:08:59 2015 UTC,Hiking in the Marines is just practicing being miserable for hours at a time.
CampingandHiking,39klhs,gpewett,16,Fri Jun 12 15:25:27 2015 UTC,The Infantry has a way of ruining outdoor recreation for sure.   And then my dubmass hiked for years (civilian hiking) with a fucking e-tool and like 12 pounds of water because I thought that's how you hike.  LoL.
CampingandHiking,39klhs,shuddertostink,3,Fri Jun 12 16:00:06 2015 UTC,lol I did the same! I think the question should be what can the military learn from backpackers
CampingandHiking,39klhs,backpackingmike,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:11:24 2015 UTC,"yeah, for real.  I mean the Infantry is just retarded compared to backpackers.

CampingandHiking,39klhs,shuddertostink,5,Fri Jun 12 21:16:33 2015 UTC,"Never understood why they made us hike everywhere at home then give us big green trucks to drive around in Iraq. The word conditioning comes to mind, but so does hernia."

CampingandHiking,39klhs,ThreeOneFive,22,Fri Jun 12 14:26:26 2015 UTC,"I started  hiking like I was still in the Infantry, never understood why I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I should.  Enjoyment factor up 500% when I bought newer lighter gear  and stopped packing for World Domination."
CampingandHiking,39klhs,shuddertostink,13,Fri Jun 12 15:48:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pretty much, carrying around 50% of your bodyweight is not a very good plan any way you try it."
CampingandHiking,39klhs,SirZerty,3,Fri Jun 12 14:36:11 2015 UTC,One thing to keep in mind is backpackers are likely doing much shorter periods of carrying weight.   The army practices might be the absolute best in preventing short term injuries - it isn't active duty troops with fucked yo backs you're dealing with.
CampingandHiking,39klhs,Cforq,3,Fri Jun 12 14:59:23 2015 UTC,At least two have been discharged from active duty because of their back injuries.
CampingandHiking,39klhs,ThreeOneFive,2,Fri Jun 12 16:37:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly!   Military is terrible when it comes to rucking. The rucks suck, they never teach how to properly wear/pack it, they encourage running during any sort of rucking event (absolutely the worst thing you can do), most military equipment isn't built to be light, etc etc etc...I could go on for ages.  Long story short, military sucks at rucking...don't believe a word they say."
CampingandHiking,39klhs,blorgensplor,5,Sat Jun 13 20:55:50 2015 UTC,"Of course, if the main reason you come into contact with veterans is because they're injured, it's not a surprise that you see mostly injured veterans."
CampingandHiking,39klhs,zck,3,Fri Jun 12 15:54:49 2015 UTC,"You don't understand, it's every combat veteran.  I've interviewed four dozen for another case I was in (that was not about VA applications but about a state benefit), every single one had significant back problems from service."
CampingandHiking,39klhs,ThreeOneFive,2,Fri Jun 12 16:35:03 2015 UTC,Once again you are focusing on the group needing benefits. I know many veterans that have no back troubles.
CampingandHiking,39klhs,5000miles2boston,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:39:55 2015 UTC,Literature backs up my anecdotal experience.
CampingandHiking,39klhs,ThreeOneFive,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:52:58 2015 UTC,"Not really literature and never offers a perspective of the numbers. One person saying something like ""vast majority"" doesn't make it so. You are still struggling with this observer bias. Citing a story about back pain in vets that doesn't provide a basis for comparison. It even cites something that I would consider literature but doesn't indicate that the issue is as wide spread as you claim. The numbers cited from that source just say it's increasing. This entire story(it is an article not literature) has observer bias an doesn't provide the data needed to back up your claim that it is ""all of them"" which I understand is hyperbole but not remotely true."
CampingandHiking,39klhs,5000miles2boston,0,Sat Jun 13 04:54:30 2015 UTC,"You did not read that article very carefully if that's your conclusion, it gets its numbers from published medical studies of veterans:   Among the key findings in studies published in a recent edition of The Spine Journal:  There have been 10 times as many long-term spinal pain casualties unrelated to combat injuries among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans compared with blast injuries.  After being medically evacuated from Iraq with non-battle-related spinal pain, patients have less than a 20% chance of returning to their unit and regular duty.  60% of veterans seeking care for spine problems have serious psychological distress."
CampingandHiking,39klhs,ThreeOneFive,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:18:23 2015 UTC,None of those mean jack shit for your point
CampingandHiking,39klhs,Kiewea14,0,Sat Jun 13 17:53:22 2015 UTC,Yet I'm still correct.
CampingandHiking,39klhs,ThreeOneFive,0,Mon Jun 15 01:52:37 2015 UTC,"I read the article quite well(most of it was fluff) the only part was when they selectively referenced a spine journal(actual literature) It doesn't address incidence or prevalence which is what your hyperbolas comment was ""every combat vet"".   The first stat is the only stat that comes close to relating the incidence of back pathology in military members and it doesn't compare the number to the number of healthy vets. It compares back injuries between non combat and combat vets. The second just indicates possibility of return not incidence. The third indicates that there is a correlation between psychological and spine pathology, which may explain the second stat.   The stat you need to prove your claim is the incidence of back pathology amongst vets verse the total pathology."
CampingandHiking,39klhs,5000miles2boston,5,Sun Jun 14 00:04:28 2015 UTC,"I work in a pharmacy that has a lot of patients with fucked up backs.  Many of them are ex-military, most are not.  The common denominator with most of these patients seems to be that they are overweight and are truck drivers.  I am not sure that being in the military is bad for backs.  Being overweight and sitting a lot is most definitely bad for backs."
CampingandHiking,39klhs,wonderfulish,5,Fri Jun 12 15:09:51 2015 UTC,"Well what happens, and has happened for my clients, is you GET fat after you have a bad back injury.  One of my clients was 145 lbs in service, jacked up his back and gained over 150 pounds after that because it hurt so much to do everyday activites."
CampingandHiking,39klhs,ThreeOneFive,0,Fri Jun 12 16:36:41 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt that you've seen that.  However, it may be a case of the chicken and the egg.  It is hard to separate the two.  The association of back injuries and weight is complex, but it exists (source).  In that study, they found that being overweight is associated with a higher incidence of low back pain and being obese is associated with the onset of low back pain in the previous 12 months. Proving causality is difficult, especially using observational methods.    Regardless, back pain sucks and it is probably a good idea to try to lose excess weight."
CampingandHiking,39klhs,wonderfulish,3,Fri Jun 12 17:22:39 2015 UTC,"Oh no, causality is not an issue for me - I have their medical records.  They were all sub-200, peak physical shape, and then complained of a back injury.  For the three of them with appeals I worked on, all had been accused of malingering because the back injuries were not obvious except for complaints from them about the pain - confirmed subsequently with MRIs.  From there, discharge and rapid weight gain from being in too much pain to walk, run or lift anything heavy."

CampingandHiking,39mji7,manofthewild07,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:26:03 2015 UTC,"Like Poultry said, its not a big difference. And like I said, what do you do? This is a camping and hiking site so I assume you take it out with you. Do you do backpacking? Do you care about weight/size? Do you like to whittle around the campfire? Do you hunt? Usually a 4 inch knife is perfect for field dressing most medium game.   I'd probably just go with the larger one."
CampingandHiking,39mji7,Poultryspice,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:56:19 2015 UTC,"Half an inch doesn't really limit you in capabilities, whereas a small knife is going to be much better at fine and detailed work and a  bigger knife at general whacking on stuff. A lot of people I know like the smaller knife for its nimbleness and precision. but in choosing a knife in this size range you really can't go wrong with either I would say however the 4.1 provides a few more capabilities."

There might be more trips on the other side of Independence Pass towards Leadville.  You could also see if there is anything around Redstone or Marble.  If you are in Basalt you could go to Bristlecone Sports and they would probably know some hikes. The Ute in Aspen would also know where you could go."

The other thing to think about is whether or not the dog is ready for hiking. 1 mile up a mountain is much different than a mile down a smooth, paved road.

CampingandHiking,39irvw,exquisitepenguins,3,Fri Jun 12 11:13:13 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts...  1) I love using stuff sacks to keep gear organized. I make my own so I get exactly the size I want. Tons of utility for very, very few grams!  2) I don't see a map, compass, or poop kit. (Maybe I didn't look closely enough). Map and compass I'd never skip. Poop kit is totally skippable if you want to dig your hole with a rock and clean up with natural materials. I would not leave out a small bottle of hand sanitizer - back country diarrhea sucks.  3) Also don't see a small first aid kit.  4) If you are interested in cutting weight from your pack, you don't need 3 pairs of socks and 3 pairs of underwear, especially if 2 of your 3 days are short. And extra pair and the pair on your body is more than enough. Same thing with deodorant. You can get better results by taking a small wash cloth and washing up in a creek (no soap, just a good refreshing rub down) than by layering on deodorant.  Enjoy your trip!!"

CampingandHiking,39irvw,DRHdez,2,Fri Jun 12 11:30:58 2015 UTC,"Ah alright.  I work as a geophysicist.  I assume you went to Kutztown.  lol. I am excited.  My buddy and I are doing like 4-5 miles tonight.  Majority of the remaining on Saturday, then finish up on Sunday."
CampingandHiking,39irvw,PapaShane,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:46:14 2015 UTC,"Haha yep, you guessed right!  K-town Proud.  I'm pretty jealous, I loved geophysics.  And it sounds like you have a good plan for this trip, hopefully your buddy can keep up with a geologist on the move!  And yes, you might find some fern fossils, those are popular in the shale around here.  Dunno if you're into the paleo side of things, but there are some neat sites in NEPA.  Have a great weekend!"
CampingandHiking,39irvw,thefairone,2,Fri Jun 12 19:59:15 2015 UTC,Bethlehem checking in.  Here's my video from doing the Pinchot back in April: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4fiuU1bzxQ
CampingandHiking,39irvw,heywaymayday,2,Fri Jun 12 17:18:23 2015 UTC,Bloomsburg gal here. I wish I was brave enough to do overnights (I hike solo).
CampingandHiking,39irvw,maxillo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:13:43 2015 UTC,Have you thought about carrying pepper spray/bear spray? That'll keep two legged and four legged animals at bay.

CampingandHiking,39irvw,lagerforlunch,2,Fri Jun 12 17:25:23 2015 UTC,You are bringing those weights right?
CampingandHiking,39irvw,terrapin_nation,15,Fri Jun 12 03:53:46 2015 UTC,"At least two 10lb plates and three 5lb.  They work really well.  I use them as a frying pan to cook bacon, and anchors for when I want to take a picture.  I also throw them at bears and shit so I don't need an AR-15, bazooka, F-16, etc."

CampingandHiking,39irvw,muggzymain,12,Fri Jun 12 12:46:20 2015 UTC,You make the bed! That's my pit bulls bed. He never makes it.  Every night he cuddles up in the sheets and likes it messy.   EDIT: Yes my dog has his own queen sized memory foam bed.
CampingandHiking,39irvw,krazykilm,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:56:03 2015 UTC,"How do you like the luminaid? Thinking of getting one for my hubby for Father's Day. Nice gear, happy hiking!"
CampingandHiking,39n7gy,springbok0,3,Fri Jun 12 23:05:57 2015 UTC,My beau's convinced me that we must visit Glacier NP.  He went as a kid. Looks beautiful and quieter than some of the bigger parks. We're going next summer. :)

CampingandHiking,39n7gy,phoenixgsu,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:37:54 2015 UTC,I'd love to either go to Crater Lake or the Badlands.

CampingandHiking,39n7gy,walkalong,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:36:45 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would go to the White Mountains in New Hampshire because I absolutely love it there, it is like a second home to me. And it is incredibly beautiful."
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,Travlar,24,Thu Jun 11 14:35:49 2015 UTC,"Well done! The map at the beginning especially made this post awesome for me. I not only love maps, but seeing this trip plan really laid out what you did before the pictures even started. More people should do this (me included)!      The pictures are also awesome. Not just 'views' and the generic stuff. Seriously interesting photos of camp, food, trail, and family. Gave a good representation of what you all experienced on this adventure.         Cheers!"
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,cwcoleman,7,Thu Jun 11 16:50:57 2015 UTC,I LOVE maps. I just bought a Garmin Fenix 2 and was dying to see the trip data when I got home.
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,cwcoleman,3,Thu Jun 11 16:53:35 2015 UTC,"Nice. I have a Garmin 62CSX. You can load the data into Google Earth - that's my favorite way to visualize a trip. I don't save most of my trip data, but I should. Mostly just watch the miles/elevation click by as I huff and puff up a mountain."
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,YogiWanKenobi,16,Thu Jun 11 16:57:02 2015 UTC,Your kids look so happy in these pics.  It's awesome that you're taking them on adventures like this.
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,Pashtacular,13,Thu Jun 11 17:51:37 2015 UTC,They are the best part. Im taking my daughter this weekend on the Tahoe Rim trail for some bonding time.
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,Pashtacular,12,Thu Jun 11 18:42:32 2015 UTC,Did you take a professional photographer along with you? These photos seem like they could be in a magazine!
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,Wintersoulstice,12,Thu Jun 11 16:27:04 2015 UTC,You are too kind. Photography became a hobby of mine when we had the kids. I wanted good pictures of our adventures.
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,chrsty,2,Thu Jun 11 16:41:20 2015 UTC,"good pictures   Sorry if this sounds cringy yet they are better than ""good"". The contrast is amazing, the colours really pop out!"
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,heypal11,3,Thu Jun 11 16:50:20 2015 UTC,I do love me some good colors!   :)
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,mara1979,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:06:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I'm no expert or anything but this has the feel of a mini story/editorial in outside magazine or something :)"
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,counterfitfake,2,Sat Jun 13 01:48:28 2015 UTC,Seriously! These are beautiful!
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,aaron403,6,Thu Jun 11 16:36:55 2015 UTC,great job! love to see the kids out there carrying their own stuff. do you need bear canisters up there?
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,trees_make_me_happy,3,Thu Jun 11 18:46:45 2015 UTC,"I keep getting told that bear canisters aren't necessary, but I bring one anyways. Better safe than sorry, plus it just gets me in the habit."
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,random_user_name_13,3,Thu Jun 11 18:58:20 2015 UTC,Wonderful wonderful wonderful!  Love it.
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,whitemagic420,3,Thu Jun 11 17:57:48 2015 UTC,"As already stated I really like the map then photo format. Also, I am really encouraged by this post because I have a son on the way and I've been afraid I'll lose my hobby in parenting/work.  Thanks for the post."
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,Daya108,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:53:33 2015 UTC,Going out with the family has been the best part. We just started homeschooling last year in order to spend more time together. By far one of our better decisions.
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,cmc51377,3,Fri Jun 12 05:03:30 2015 UTC,I love this area.  You remind me how much I need to go back.
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,IWantThatSign,3,Thu Jun 11 15:16:51 2015 UTC,Its so easy to get to. One our best trips for sure.
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,IWantThatSign,3,Thu Jun 11 15:28:19 2015 UTC,"Can I ask for tips for going with your family/ being new to backpacking?  I've never actually gone (I'm 34), but have always really, really wanted to.  I keep psyching myself out though (especially about bears, I live in upstate NY so most of the places to go have some kind of bear activity) and now we have a 2.5 year old.  My husband is also very far from an outdoors person.  We go car camping all the time but he still can't really start a fire.  So yeah, would you recommend it have any tips and how old were your kids when you started?  Love, love your pictures too by the way!"
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,milkywayyzz,3,Fri Jun 12 00:26:38 2015 UTC,I live near this area in the OP. I've lived in the area my entire life. I've hiked many miles in the Sierras and I've never once seen a bear! They honestly are more afraid of you! Don't be afraid to get out there. Good boots and a pack. I have a Camelbak Rim Runner pack. It's big enough to hold all my stuff for a long day hike and carries 3L of water. Reading some books on basic first aid/survival are good as well. And it's always better to carry just a little too much and be over prepared than not enough and be under prepared. Get out there and enjoy it!!
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,Hakim_Slackin,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:45:02 2015 UTC,I agree. Just doing it is the best advice. Plus backpackers are some of the most helpful people. I LOVE REI because everyone there is so knowledgeable. We spend hours fitting out packs to make sure everything was perfect and they were happy to do it.
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,Hakim_Slackin,2,Fri Jun 12 05:09:42 2015 UTC,"So we started last year when the kids were 6 and 8. We probably could have started the year before, but we didn't have the money for the gear. Last spring we headed to REI and started the annual tradition of handing them boatloads of cash. We geared up completely as we were starting from scratch. I've watched lots of videos on everything from packing packs to cooking to setting up tents. However, a lot of it was just trial and error. This trip was our 4th and by far the smoothest. The ones before had quite a few bumps along the way. One trip we ran out of cooking fuel, another we forgot one of my wife's boots. Just random stuff. Now we have a list and locations for all our gear. Just by sight we will know if something is missing. In California the bears are giant sissy's, so I don't worry about them much. We have the bear canister and keep anything with a scent in it and far away from camp at night. So far no problems. I have a friend who has been doing this with his family a lot longer and he tells me that sometimes in the morning you will see that something has batted the canister around a bit, but that's it. To start, we just did some day hikes. 4 miles or a bit longer to get everyone used to walking long distances. Then worked our way up from there."
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,GreenbeanGirl,3,Fri Jun 12 05:08:30 2015 UTC,"That was the crazy part. There were probably 50 cars in the parking area when we got there which bummed me out. On the main sections of the trail we saw a few people. However, once off trail and at the lakes we didn't see or hear anyone. It was quite incredible. We also went from Saturday to Monday, so by Sunday night most people had cleared out."
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,wollington,3,Thu Jun 11 17:27:54 2015 UTC,"I have back packed and camped in the grouse ridge area, a truly under appreciated piece of wilderness."
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,wollington,3,Thu Jun 11 17:49:17 2015 UTC,And far more comfortable than in Sacramento when it is 100 out.
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,wollington,2,Thu Jun 11 18:11:27 2015 UTC,"The photos are beautiful! I hope that one day when I have a family of my own, they will also get to enjoy such trips! Thanks for the inspiration."
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,BigSpooky,5,Thu Jun 11 18:43:34 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'm so happy that everyone in the family enjoys the outdoors as much as I do. We have 8 more trips on the calendar this year to still look forward to.
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,nicholas34silva,4,Thu Jun 11 18:46:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's amazing! I'm waiting for my two year old to be old enough for these trips. Great job!"
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,alliOops,2,Thu Jun 11 19:01:14 2015 UTC,"I love this area! As others have said, way underrated as far as Tahoe goes. What were the temps like?"
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,D_DM7_D7_G_Gm_D_E_A,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:43:01 2015 UTC,It was beautiful. 70 at the highest during the day (which was warm enough to make me sweat while hiking) and at night the lowest we saw was 48. The second night had a bit of wind which sucked the heat out of our tents so we wore an extra layer and beanies. Everyone was plenty warm though.
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,D_DM7_D7_G_Gm_D_E_A,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:46:51 2015 UTC,That's a perfect range. Glad to hear it was so nice. Didn't comment on your pics before but they are fantastic.
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,Tammo2011,2,Fri Jun 12 05:11:45 2015 UTC,"Soo pumped that you posted this! Thats one of my favorite areas, and yes the map post first was a great way for me to wrap my head around exactly where you were. I'm headed there in a couple weeks to do basically do what you did but might end up at glacier lake. Thanks for posting! I should be up there now because I think it is supposed hit like 103* tomorrow"
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,manofthewild07,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:46:45 2015 UTC,"The Sierra's are where its at. Lots of people have said glacier lake is amazing, so let me know how it goes. I'm taking my daughter out to Meiss Valley this weekend to get away from the heat again. Should be fun."
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,GromitsTrousers,2,Fri Jun 12 00:18:19 2015 UTC,"Corn-flower plants, huh? I always called them butt-wipe plants."
CampingandHiking,39g6cp,manofthewild07,2,Fri Jun 12 05:12:49 2015 UTC,I'm totally using this next trip. My son will laugh.
