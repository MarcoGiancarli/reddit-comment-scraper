AskNetsec,3dpsxg,Ninja_Fox_,14,Sat Jul 18 07:12:42 2015 UTC,"No, that's not how it works. Every modern WiFi ap/router (consumer or professional) uses the same security protocol (wpa2) which performs a four way handshake. It's all very complicated. You can Google it if you want more details. But basically, each end (computer and router) generates a master key based on the password you select. When you try to connect, the router and computer challenge each other to verify they both know the same key. If they agree you are allowed to connect.   That said, it is possible to capture this handshake (passively) and, over time, analyze it and figure out the password. It's not easy though."

AskNetsec,3dpsxg,root3r,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:53:19 2015 UTC,It would be awesome if you can share that how you did wireless network pentesting.
AskNetsec,3dpsxg,NetSecPentester,2,Sun Jul 19 09:44:28 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. The first step is to determine from the client what they want, (goals) etc. Next we'll identify wireless networks and then attack them. In the following I will be aiming at WPA2 Enterprise since that is what I used on my last pentest. Some notes before we begin about WPA-Enterprise and how to use airodump-ng with Wireshark to determine EAP type is at the following link (need to read this!):  http://securitysynapse.blogspot.com/2014/02/wireless-pentesting-on-cheap-kali-WPAEntPartI.html  It is important to read this (I don't have room to type it all here) as you need to identify the exact type of EAP the target company is using.  VERY IMPORTANT, do not continue with the second article (WPAEntPartII.html) as it is outdated and the wireless setup does not work, instead continue with the example(s) give below:  Passive Identification and Recon  Using the link provided above, you will basically use airodump-ng to identify the wireless network and examine its details like in the previous link and then lock on it. Afterwards, you will use wireshark to quickly inspect the packets to determine the EAP type. The article mentioned above is great for attacking LEAP and EAP-MD5 since both do not use a secure tunnel to pass the authentication protocol, you would just need to sniff the traffic and crack the password using a brute force attack similar to the WPA-PSK attack. All of the information needed to crack the credentials is contained within the 4-way handshake, thus the attack will be very similar.    Since PEAP and EAP-TLS use a secure tunnel to pass the inner authentication protocol, we will later create a fake RADIUS server and fake access point and convince the client to connect to our infrastructure. This will be accomplished by having a stronger signal than their access point and then deauthenticating the client so they connect to our AP.  This diagram will help to illustrate the attack process.  In the first image, we see normal operation of a client connected to the access point and the access point passing the authentication on to the RADIUS server.  In the second image, we see a deauth attack followed by the client connecting to the fake access point and an attempt to authenticate to the attackers RADIUS server.  This should yield the information necessary to begin a brute force attack of the credentials.  Let’s look at the detailed steps that are required to make this happen.     If you followed the first link you should have already identified the type of EAP in use.   Let's go over how I typically start wireless assessments:  Kismet  Kismet is a great WIFI tool to sniff, identify, and monitor wireless traffic. If you are in Kali linux just type, ""kismet"".  This will open the Kismet application, which will send your wireless interface information (you can find this by doing an ifconfig on a separate terminal window). In my case, wireless interface is on wlan1.  If everything works properly, you can close that window (try pressing the tab button if you are stuck) and you will see a listing of all the SSIDs, channels, signal strength, and more.  The colors of the different wireless networks represent the following:   Yellow - Unencrypted Network Red - Factory default settings in use Green - Secure Networks (WEP, WPA, etc) Blue - SSID cloaking on / Broadcast SSID disabled   After selecting an SSID, you will immediately see information about that Access Point such as the BSSID, manufacturer, type of encryption and signal strength/packet loss. This is great for identifying where an access point is located and how we are going to attack it.   By pressing the ""~"" (tilde) key, V key, and then the C key, you will see all the clients that are connected to this access point.  This is useful when doing de-authentication attacks or denial of service attacks against the Access Point.  Active Attacks  After you identify the networks you are to attack or networks that are within scope of your assessment, you need to figure out which active attacks to use. We'll focus on the WPA Enterprise since that was my original example. WEP is easy to crack and info can be found all over the internet for it. WPA2 is also not difficult and I can explain that if there is room/time. One thing I want to reiterate is that I'm going for the quickest and easiest way to crack wireless passwords or gain access to a wireless infrastructure. There are many different tools to attack WIFI like aircrack-ng (one of my favorites) but I will focus on getting the job done.  One of my favorite attacks for enterprise environments is the fake radius attack. The problem with WPAv2 Enterprise networks is that all the normal WEP/WPAv2 TKIP type attacks do not work. To get around this, Josh Wright developed a method to capture username/password combinations for WPAv2 Enterprise-grade wireless using a radius server.  Configuring a Radius Server  To configure your Radius server, we need to download and modify it. Download the Radius software using the following:   wget ftp://ftp.freeradius.org/pub/freeradius/old/freeradius-server-2.1.12.tar.bz2 tar xfj freeradius-server-2.1.12.tar.bz2 cd freeradius-server-2.1.12 wget http://willhackforsushi.com/code/freeradius-wpe-2.1.12.patch We need to next patch our Radius server: patch -p1 < freeradius-wpe-2.1.12.patch ./configure && make && make install   We need to edit the configurations now:   cat >> client.conf <<EOF client 192.168.1.1 { secret = mysecret } EOF   Then type:  radiusd -X  In a separate terminal:   tail -f /usr/local/var/log/radius/freeradius-server-wpe.log   Example Output:  mschap: Sun Jul 19 02:19:39 2015      username: admin         challenge: 07:50:2a:b7:a6:4d:24:d1           response: fc:9d:19:06:c0:79:c3:f5:ad:db:6b:79:59:2f:7f:6e:d8:05:19:c4:5d:26:30:08      mschap: Sun Jul 19 02:19:39 2015     username: user1         challenge: 34:ab:f0:95:62:52:85:40         response: 9e:0c:e7:80:06:2f:a0:0b:c3:d7:c7:d7:c6:38:ec:0a:e5:a3:57:8c:33:2c:8e:0f        and so and so on...   Once you captured the challenge/response and username (in this case we will use the ""admin"" username challenge/response since it is a key account) for the authentication request, you can move on to prepping the password lists. Before you can crack the passwords, you need to convert a word list to be used with the Asleap application to try to brute-force passwords. This can be accomplished using the following code to convert the password list (I'm using the darkc0de list as an example) into multiple output files for Asleap.   genkeys -r darkc0de.lst -f words.dat -n words.idx   Asleap  Asleap is a tool used to recover LEAP and PPTP type connections, which utilize a password list from gensys. Asleap will take in the challenge and response as demonstrated below.  root@kali~/wireless# asleap -f words.dat -n words.idx -C 07:50:2a:b7:a6:4d:24:d1 -R fc:9d:19:06:c0:79:c3:f5:ad:db:6b:79:59:2f:7f:6e:d8:05:19:c4:5d:26:30:08   (notice that the -C is the challenge captured earlier and the -R is the response captured earlier)  You will see something like the following:  asleap 2.2 - actively recover LEAP/PPTP passwords. <jwright@hashborg.com> hash bytes: 0157 NT hash: 5e7599f673df11d5c5c4d950f5bf0157 password: hacker   In the example above, we were able to decrypt the challenge/response hash for a WPA-Enterprise authentication. Now, we can take these credentials and log back into their wireless network.  Sorry for the book but I felt it was necessary to give a true example start to finish. Hope it helps!"

AskNetsec,3dpsxg,ldpreload,2,Sat Jul 18 10:30:05 2015 UTC,"The only solution is some kind of challenge/response with RSA.   Remember that symmetric crypto is a thing. Instead of a public/private keypair, you can have a single, secret key that's used for encryption / authentication, where both the sender and the recipient use the same key. If all you have is a symmetrically-encrypted or symmetrically-authenticated message, you can't figure out the key from that.  So it's safe for your computer to send authenticated messages. If the other end already knows the key that you have, they'll let you connect. If they don't, they don't gain anything."

AskNetsec,3dpsxg,bNimblebQuick,2,Sat Jul 18 18:32:56 2015 UTC,"I think there are three parts to answer here:  1) You are not being targeted specifically. Any network which the rogue AP/router sees a client searching for, it will try to spoof. Your device is looking for your home network, hence it was spoofed.  2) WPA requires a challenge response handshake already, so your password is safe...UNLESS they are in range to observe the entire handshake between your device and your home network, and even then, the current attacks rely on weak passwords and dictionary/brute force attacks. (in other words, its gonna take a while if your password is strong, so if your WPA password is your ""street name"" + ""DOB"" that will take about 5 minutes to crack, if its 32 random characters, it'll take so long as to not be feasible). Your fear of someone tracking a victim down and following them is a little backwards from the way a real attack would happen. They want to find you AT your house, while you are USING your device, then kick you off and watch you re-join the network. If they can get a clean capture of the full handshake, they might be able to crack the original password.  3) Don't hide your SSID or MAC filter, its not going to help anything. Pick a strong WPA password and limit the number of networks you ""save"" on your devices, especially those with no encryption (no encryption =  no barrier to your device joining a rogue network and someone watching/modifiying/spoofing/SSL stripping your traffic)."

The downside is that it requires a lot of work to keep it secure.  For example, it's easy when prompted about an app that wants to read/write files, just to click permit all...which of course eliminates the protection."

Actually, I just re-read your post and realized that you're looking for protection against a co-worker (someone with physical access to the computer).  To help with this, enable FileVault (full disk encryption).  Require a password to login and when the screensaver is activated.  In most cases, this should prevent the coworker from accessing the computer without you.  If you still suspect something, you could try installing an app like PeriscopePro (http://zipzapmac.com/PeriscopePro).

AskNetsec,3dn9zf,zigitax-1,4,Fri Jul 17 17:33:17 2015 UTC,"The answer to both questions is ""It depends.""   The Hacking Team stuff works on Insyde (and maybe AMI) BIOS/UEFI implementations. According to their own slides it requires physical access to execute. Insyde has also publicly said that the malware in most cases leverages patched vulnerabilities. If you're worried about that specific malware, you're probably going to be okay. If you want to defend against similar attacks set an administrator password, enable UEFI SecureFlash, and keep your UEFI up to date. Flashing the UEFI/BIOS after you suspect being compromised could work, it could not work. You have no way knowing without doing a lot of lab work.   As for hard drives, it's technically possible and it depends on the model. If you've got something supported by a utility like HDDGuru's Firmware Update Utility you can flash a new firmware. But as with flashing over an infected UEFI/BIOS, there are no guarantees. Most of the time the HDD you're working with won't have a utility that can flash to it, or it won't have firmwares publicly available. In this case you need to get some very specialized hardware, dump the firmware when you buy the drive, and then flash the dump to the hard drive if it becomes suspect.   At this point you should just buy new components. Just make sure to do it in person and not through mail. This level of compromise means you can't trust the hardware."

AskNetsec,3dosit,temptemp12,6,Sat Jul 18 00:48:59 2015 UTC,"The (slightly oversimplified) answer is on most sites yes, on a small minority of sites including Google no.  It depends on how many web servers are actually hosting the site (e.g. www.google.com won't all be run from a single server) and if the same certificate has been installed on each server, or an individual certificate per server/load balancer"
AskNetsec,3dosit,TheStrays,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:00:36 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I've been looking at the SSL serial number/fingerprint on three different computers. Two of them match but the third doesn't. I thought maybe there was some sort of man in the middle attack going on. But I haven't been able to find a list of google's current SSL certs. Do you know of a site that would have that information?
AskNetsec,3dosit,ldpreload,3,Sat Jul 18 01:47:41 2015 UTC,"Primarily, the way you check certs is by seeing if they're signed. Are they signed by a valid authority and do they have the same name on them?  Is the authority in fact valid, or does one computer have additional malicious authorities installed? (If there's local malware capable of installing malicious authorities, it is technically possible to fake the dialog that displays cert information, but harder; most malware doesn't bother. But if you're worried about this, you can save the certificate and examine it on another computer. It's a signed document, so anyone can verify it.) For Google in particular, they sign all their certs via the Google Internet Authority, which is a delegated CA that is in turn signed by one of the major public CAs.  There are a few ways you can ask if other people have seen the same certificate, like Certificate Transparency and the EFF Observatory, but at the moment they're not particularly straightforward / broadly applicable. Hopefully this will change in the next year or so. But even so, that's a secondary mechanism. The real question is whether the cert is signed by someone authorized to sign certs. If so, it is by definition valid."
AskNetsec,3dosit,TheStrays,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:16:59 2015 UTC,"Everything /u/ldpreload has said here is correct, but one additional thing to keep in mind when checking the signing chain is there is a possibility that a trusted certificate authority could sign a certificate without the knowledge of the site owner, which would mean the certificate is valid, albeit illegitimate. This has happened on occasion, although it is pretty rare. Even if it were to happen, the person controlling the illegitimate certificate still needs to find a way to get the client to connect to them instead of the legitimate site, either by being a man in the middle, or something like DNS poisoning.  This is another area where Google is the exception to the usual rule - while there is nothing to stop this happening for their domains, they have written code into Chrome that will detect this for anyone who encounters one of these certificates when using Chrome and immediately disallow the connection and send an alert back to Google. Obviously this is not feasible for the vast majority of sites, it is only because of Google's position in the market where they produce one of the major browsers that they are able to do this."
AskNetsec,3dosit,ShakataGaNai,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:19:24 2015 UTC,"First the direct answers:  ""Do SSL certs from the same https web server have the same fingerprint?"" -- More than likely, yes, they would be the same  ""If I go to google.com on different computers...would they be the same?"" -- Probably not.  Now the verbose answer:  The big problem is that you're equating a domain name a server to be the same thing, for most companies, they are not.  Google runs hundreds of thousands of servers, and some percentage of that is actually serving the website.  So they may have 100,000 servers that actually serve ""google.com"".  Each one of them may very well have a different fingerprint.  On top of that, Google (and other major companies) run multiple datacenters around the world, and direct traffic to the closest datacenter.  So if you live in San Francisco, you might talk to a google servers/datacenter in the SF Bay Area.  If you live in Japan, you'll talk to servers/datacenter in Tokyo, etc.  So asking your friend to check a fingerprint means they're talking to different servers in different parts of the world.  Generally the only time a domain name = a server, is with really really small websites.  If someone runs their own webserver and installs their own SSL certificate, you'd probably get the same fingerprint all the time.  However it's become more popular to run small websites on big webfarms (see also: the google problem above), or through a CDN like AWS CloudFront or CloudFlare which use all the same tricks google does.  Also keep in mind that most sites rotate their certificates on a regular basis (roughly yearly, sometimes more often).  In those cases fingerprints will change as well."

Best practice is often to tunnel it over SSH port forwarding, stunnel, etc., but for remote management, that's probably not an option.  RealVNC, a company started by the original VNC developers, has proprietary extensions to the protocol to implement real security (over TLS, it looks like), but they're not part of the standard RFB protocol.

AskNetsec,3dk3zx,dhupp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:48:40 2015 UTC,"I have not played with OKWS, but I've read the paper and we worked with a reimplementation of the idea in class. I've also worked on a shared-hosting environment that aggressively pursues privilege separation beyond the industry standard, and we're seeing only some of these things make sense in 2015 (including the very concept of shared hosting). A lot has changed since OKWS was written in 2004:   At the time, best practice for dynamic websites was to use something like mod_php or mod_perl, which links a language interpreter into the address space of the web server. Now we have things like FastCGI, WSGI, etc., and in many places, best practice is to have a frontend server like nginx in front of an actual-HTTP server implemented by your dynamic language. That itself gets you a good chunk of the way there. If you put nginx in one Docker container and your app in another, then you're basically there. (Although it'd be nice for someone to approach this as a security problem and make an intentionally-secure architecture, like an OKWS for 2015 best practices instead of for 2004 best practices.) Privilege separation between the applications making up your web server is just not that useful. It's the wrong direction. What you really want to privilege-separate is different users. If I get code execution in the web server but no further (which the OKWS model assumes someone will do eventually), I can just wait until another user logs in, at which point I can MITM any of their requests. It's much less common in 2015 to run mutually-distrusting applications on the same web server (shared hosting). We have VMs or at least containers; people just run different services in different VMs or containers. It's only incompetent small-time failed Bitcoin exchanges that run production financial infrastructure and a WordPress blog on the same server with the same SQL account. In 2004, everyone did this. Best practice was to run all your CGIs as the www-data account and hope for the best. Remote code execution vulnerabilities in web servers (Apache 2.x, at least) have, for whatever reason, been pretty rare of late. Meanwhile (at least five to seven years ago or so), local privilege escalation exploits in the Linux kernel were pretty common. It does you no good to aggressively privsep at the userspace level if breaking into Apache lets you break into the kernel and take over any user account you want. Again, this is solved by VMs, which weren't a thing in 2004. (x86 hardware virtualization showed up in 2006.) OKWS includes its own mechanisms for templating, dynamic rendering, etc. In C++. To be fair, Django and Rails were created a year later, in 2005. But now that those things exist, nobody wants to write web pages in C++. Along those lines, the performance claims appear to compare OKWS talking to a persistent C++ webapp backend with Apache using mod_php. So it's not an apples-to-apples comparison of what people other than OkCupid would actually write.   That said, I see echoes of several of these ideas in Sandstorm.io, which turns out to be solving a somewhat similar problem: you're hosting multiple, mutually untrusted services on the same machine behind a single web server. Sandstorm has a 2015 design, and does a lot of things that take into account some of the changes in the real-world situation (for instance, services run in a real seccomp + container sandbox, not just a chroot), and they're also following a much more aggressive research approach (e.g. there's a lot of capability-based security). But I can see similarities in how it does privilege-separation of the web server and actual services. Where the OKWS design still makes sense, the Sandstorm folks seem to have ended up doing similar things."

AskNetsec,3de3ga,Forsvars,3,Wed Jul 15 15:35:00 2015 UTC,"Since security is such a broad subject, the answer will vary widely depending on the job you're doing. I've held a couple different jobs within security and I've used Python at most of them.  Enterprise/corporate security: I used Python and bash to automate a lot of my day-to-day or time consuming stuff. For example, I had some reports I needed to get from our identity management system and feed into a reporting system. They didn't speak each others language, so I wrote a script to translate the CSV reports into the necessary format. Working with a SIEM, we had a system that did not use syslog, and the SIEM couldn't read the format it did support. So I wrote a Python script to convert the logs to syslog and then forward them on.  Right now I'm working at a SIEM/IDS vendor, and when we do implementations the client will oftentimes ask us to prove the system by running some mock exploits or a quick pentest. Most of this revolves around ""try to log in 5 times with the wrong password"" or ""connect to 100 machines on the same port within 10 minutes"". Tedious and often impossible to do by hand, writing a simple Python script is a much better option.  If you're seeking to learn more Python as it relates to security, check out Black Hat Python or Violent Python.

AskNetsec,3dbfz1,1-adam-12,2,Wed Jul 15 07:01:22 2015 UTC,"Despite popular belief, attribution does help in multiple aspects of information security. From an IR standpoint, identifying a specific attacker or attack group (nation state, cyber crime, hactivist) allows us to get quick wins by identifying compromised systems based on other TTPs used by that attacker. I've been on multiple IR cases where we were able to ID the attacker based on the TTPs used on a few systems. We then used other TTPs known to be used by that attacker to quickly identify other compromised systems in the environment. This also lead to the discovery of new TTPs used by that group and saved us time from investigation to remediation. From a pentest standpoint, understanding who is most likely to target your organization allows you to test attacker TTPs and methodologies against your network, and reduce your risk from the most likely source of compromise (notice I said ""reduce"", not ""eliminate""). From an executive leadership standpoint, understanding who is targeting your organization, or who is responsible for the compromise, allows you to better understand the threat landscape and make informed decisions of what organizations or countries you want to do business with.

The ""WAN"" and ""LAN"" generally refer to ports (you can think of them as 2 physical ports on the hardware firewall appliance, but they could technically be one port). The ""WAN"" port would have a Ethernet cable (or fiber, the physical cabling isn't important here) connecting it to a modem (again, as an example). The ""LAN"" port would have an Ethernet cable connecting it to your internal switch. Traffic coming from outside your network would hit the WAN interface first, and therefor, you will need to add firewall rules here to allow in what traffic you want (assuming there is an implicit deny all rule at the bottom). If the traffic is allowed, it will be NATed to an internal address your server uses."

How do you even distinguish between a tablet or laptop anymore? In fact, Microsoft even has a SaaS model for this called enterprise mobility suite.   Not all corporations provide a stipend, require software, or have minimum requirements - although this is definitely best practices from an IT perspective. A stereotypical company that has no standards is large real estate or companies that have lots of independent ""contractors"" that are still essentially employees, such as construction firms and hired gun software dev shops. Their CIO figures that people come and go too quickly to be providing devices or even supporting devices - so from a corporate perspective the major standard is ""You have to be able to log in to our web based corporate portal and our web-based corporate apps, you can figure out everything else.""

He only accesses a gmail account that he owns  The employer only provides the connectivity.   the IT guy said something wasn't right and needed to see the system...day after I re-imaged    Let's be honest here: it's probably a domain connected device with something simple like Direct Access, or otherwise managed through a GPO. Or, their corporate router/firewall detected a change in the system at some layer (i.e., outdated browser, drivers, OS version) and this raised a red flag as being possibly an unknown device on the network. That's why IT guy got a warning.   It's hugely implausible that a corporate entity would run some sort of MITM malware injection onto the client device. Then, assuming they were willing to take the legal risk - to also root the device would be ridiculous. What's the purpose of this? Monitoring employees covertly? Why not monitor them overtly?

AskNetsec,3d2euf,Mimaste7,12,Sun Jul 12 23:52:27 2015 UTC,"Back when I worked corporate security, we had a breach overnight that was discovered the next morning. We called all the relevant people (network, information security, application, physical security) into the situation room to figure out what happened and what to do next. This group was formed of a highly trusted subset of people from multiple teams, and everyone in the room was as close to Top Secret as anyone gets in that company. A very highly trusted group of people there to help the security team investigate. As we were going through the details and likely scenarios for what happened, it slowly became obvious that the likely culprit for the breach was sitting in the room with us. We all had our laptops open and one by one everyone started IMing each other what we all were coming to realize. At that point we called a break so the management could brief the c-levels and the engineers could dig into this employee's access records without him watching us. That employee's access was revoked that day and he was gone by the end of the week.  I actually still have nightmares about it sometimes. I know I'm not a great storyteller so you don't get the full effect here, but it was this great untold secret that everyone in the room kind of realized on their own, using their own tools and methods. There was a huge elephant in the room while we tried to figure out how to discuss this without him overhearing, how to investigate more without him catching on, and how to alert the management without him knowing. It got pretty awkward when he himself said ""man from the looks of it you could almost be able to pin it on me haha"". Yup. Almost. We had to investigate everyone whose name came up in our search, but every time the evidence led back to one of the most trusted people in the company. Revoking his access meant touching almost every product in our environment. Resetting root passwords that only he knew. Revoking SSL certs because he controlled the escrow. It was literally the worst (realistic) outcome. And there wasn't even a gain for him, it was just a proof of concept exploit. But the fact that it was done on purpose with full knowledge of the repercussions, by someone who was not authorized to do that, and it left us wide open to other attacks if we hadn't caught it so quick..."
AskNetsec,3d2euf,freehunter,3,Mon Jul 13 03:55:34 2015 UTC,Any chance you were all wrong and it wasn't really him?
AskNetsec,3d2euf,rcsheets,4,Mon Jul 13 10:41:37 2015 UTC,"We really wanted to be wrong. Literally every team's investigation led back to him: his user account, his badge swiping into the data center, his work-issued laptop, his his home IP address. When he was finally confronted, he tried to play it off as a pen test, one he was not authorized to perform. We really really wanted any other option than to let him go. he was so critical to our IT operations. The company learned a lot about security and best practices in the days between the event and his dismissal.  That's part of my nightmares, is that we got the wrong guy and sent this employee on his way for nothing. And with that, the real culprit is still out there. That's extremely unlikely, though."
AskNetsec,3d2euf,freehunter,2,Mon Jul 13 12:47:27 2015 UTC,"This is a really interesting story. Was he just trying to test some exploit and then it unintentionally got out of control, or did he actually intentionally leave some gaping hole, or what?  Or a better way of asking... if this was something he confessed to the instant the breach was discovered, instead of trying to cover it up, could he have kept his job?"
AskNetsec,3d2euf,catcradle5,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:56:28 2015 UTC,"I was just a lowly peon and this was years ago so I couldn't tell you what management was thinking at the time. It's possible that if he came clean before we caught it, he may have kept his job, but the question would always remain why he did it. It wasn't really an exploit. We never got the full story, but our theory was that he was setting up for something bigger. The final outcome could have been a secure pipeline for moving data out of our network out-of-band in an untraceable way or it could have been a complete and overt hijack of the company's IT infrastructure for ransom. As detected, though, it was just a re-routing of traffic for just a few minutes during a time of day when our network had the least amount of traffic and was the least likely to be noticed by anything other than automated tools. It was reverted back before we were even alerted. From what we could tell, there was literally no damage, which is what led us to believe that it was a setup for something bigger.  If he had confessed before we found it and made up some story to explain the reasoning, he might have kept his job. Without a really good explanation, he still would have been, at the very least, heavily reprimanded. We on the security team likely would never trust him in the same way again, though. We're talking about running all of the company's inbound traffic through a third party network then piping it back to the company. That's not a ""whoopsie"", that's an intentional and very blatant breach. He did confess after being confronted with the evidence, but he just called it a pen test and left the explanation at that."

AskNetsec,3d17k9,Shin_Ichi,3,Sun Jul 12 17:56:20 2015 UTC,"The particular issue here is no ISP of any account is going to have its DHCP server internet addressable from outside the ISP. For example my ISPs DHCP server is on a 172 address. You will have to attack the server from inside the network. This means the ISP will know who you are, or at least which node is doing the attack. Next, unless you have very good connectivity you probably will not be able to DOS the server from inside the network. This really does depend on what kind of network we are talking about. Cable modems? DSL? Wireless? Many of these will put some kind of rate limiting on DHCP by each client. The DHCP server is likely to be protected by a rate limiting firewall also."

AskNetsec,3d17k9,hithereimigor,4,Sun Jul 12 20:20:10 2015 UTC,Use ARP spoofing to spoof the address of the default gateway. You can then either relay the traffic through your node which will give you the option to sniff everything or just drop it and deny internet access to the clients.

This is done with malicious domains to redirect traffic.  For example:  While browsing tentacle porn on his lunch break, bob infects his machine with malware.  The malware makes several requests to known malicious domains from Bobs computer while he's busy scrolling past pixelated junk.  A DNS sinkhole would intercept the DNS requests and respond with an internal address.  The malware on Bobs porn finder would then be attempting to contact that internal address instead of its remote servers.  As the sinkhole administrator, you'd see port 80/443/whatever traffic hitting your sinkhole address and know that bobs machine is likely infected.  Again.  Without this, the malicious DNS requests would come from the Internal DNS server and you wouldn't have visibility into the infected client.  Hope that helps!"

AskNetsec,3cukox,akuta,3,Fri Jul 10 22:37:03 2015 UTC,"That's not completely correct. OS X by default uses no extension for executable programs (.app and .dmg can be used to package them, but the real executable is still inside), and stores application executables in AppName.app/MacOS/.

AskNetsec,3cpjlp,gavreaux,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:40:30 2015 UTC,"For the most sensitive data (FBI CJIS) 2 factor is a requirement, but unfortunately the current plan (per customer requirements) is to use OAAM which is a really watered down 2factor (two things you know! w00t.)  But  the overhead of maintaining/licensing  OAAM for thousands of users is being raised as an issue, so I am bringing up google auth as an alternative.  However, the 2factor requirement only applies to a subset of users who access the most sensitive data (FBI CJIS data), so I would still like to make sure I have good security at the password level.  In addition to securing our own system, as many of the users of the system will be government employees of other agencies, I want to make sure we aren't a vector for password leaks, so Im concerned about the passwords even if the account itself is protected by TFA.

(in other words, allow dictionary words but require all four character types).  Keep in mind the password length/strength is only an issue where it can be brute-forced. If your UI locks the account after x number of tries, then the need for something crazy-strong is a waste of time/energy, IMHO.  Overall a strength-meter  and use of upper/lower/number/special character with no repeating characters, no default human-generated new-user passwords (e.g. welcome1), and strong controls around forgotten password recovery, and you've covered the bases."

AskNetsec,3cpjlp,Mr-Yellow,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:22:06 2015 UTC,"272bits (I know, this is a weird length.)  Heres an example of one of my salts in the database. The 100000 is instructions about how many iterations of hashing to use.  100000.rTKZuNh0z17pRxGWPO/bgEzZkrSm90VY4C/KIunOSg1hkw==  So a brute force rainbow table without salt is 958 (you could subtract out all the ones that don't match my password rules, but someone using a rainbow table is unlikely to do that) (In actuality the rainbow table is probably bigger than this, because they will also probably pre-hash 7/6 char passwords too)  Adding in the 272bit salt gives 834 combinations PER PASSWORD. Therefore the number of entries in the hypothetical rainbow table is ~3.3e+46.   This is the whole point of salting, that you can't realistically pre-compute them, that you have to brute force on a per salt basis in real time. To solve that problem I'm using PBKDF2 at 100k rounds which makes it ~1sec per hash."
AskNetsec,3cpjlp,Mr-Yellow,3,Fri Jul 10 14:20:22 2015 UTC,"Ok. For some reason I skipped over the original part where you mentioned using PBKDF2 when I first read it. I blame too little coffee and too many meetings. But yes, I think your bases are covered with your salt length. Generally we can be pretty comfortable with anything 128-bit+.  I think you have reached the same place many of us have: truly strong passwords and human brains don't go together. So the solution is either true TFA, ""suck it up, buttercup""... or accept some risk that probably isn't very palatable considering recent events at OPM. Unfortunately if the protected PII in question is not that of the actual users, then buy-in for password rules at near-DoD standards is going to be much harder to get. People seem to be much more cavalier with security when they aren't the ones whose butts are on the line. But making a case along that line of reasoning may be your best bet to keep it locked down."

I always give the example of requirements from the military.

Anyhow, the methodology for pentesting is still good to learn from it and a few other small things. The ONLY book you need to read to pass the test is the All-In-One series CEH book. You can find it on Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/Certified-Ethical-Hacker-Second-Edition/dp/0071836489/ref=dp_ob_title_bk  As for the Hacker Academy I have no idea on it. I've seen the guys and talked to them at the last Defcon as they had a booth there. Seems okay for beginners and the price plan isn't too bad. I personally love the Pentesting with Kali course (PWK) from Offensive Security as it is just awesome and their labs are awesome. I know I learned a tremendous amount from it when I did their Pentesting with Backtrack (PWB) course years ago.   Give it a shot for a month and see how you like it. I saw in their demo video some a quick screenshot of them teaching assembly so hopefully they can teach that more-difficult subject in a way that is easy to understand. Let us know how it is when you try it."

""Hacker Academy"" is pretty overkill for CEH. And unnecessary for real pen testing certs at that. OSCP, OSCE, and GPEN have practical classes you're forced to take anyway. It doesn't seem bad if you want to expand your skill for skill's sake or get CEU/CPEs. But for certs I'd stick to cert-specific training materials.

You help with technical issues, run some errands for the instructor if they need you to alert SANS tech support of anything, and stay late to cleanup.  It'll result in a long 6 days, but to get the courses at that discount seems worth it if you want access to the people and material.

You email the code to the user's Exchange email address, which is accessible with OWA using the same username/password combo.  Possibly secure, but difficult to validate: You are asking for a username/password and 1 time code to login to corporate VPN. You email the code to the user's personal email address, which has no correlation with their VPN username/password.

Remember, security is not a binary choice; there are not things that are secure and things that are not secure. It's a sliding scale with things that are more secure and less secure. If you can (in terms of cost and user acceptance) implement hardware tokens. For that matter, if you can implement remote biological 2FA, do that. Chances are though, you can't -- which is why you are even having this discussion. In such a case, chose the most secure option you can implement."

You are pretty spot on for who hires security people. Banks/financial/health care typically have their own security teams. Government entities and their contractors typically have their own security teams. And then security firms offer security services for companies that either don't have a security team, are understaffed and need an outside team to fill in spots, or for companies that need to have a third party perform testing to verify their own security or for regulatory reasons. An easy example of a security firm is Trustwave. Most of their employees are consultants (I'm a consultant, but not for Trustwave - I work for a much smaller company) and they offer various security offerings to their clients."
AskNetsec,3cl8ml,unashamedgeek,2,Wed Jul 8 20:49:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks.    I recognize that this is a sterotype but large corporations (and especially the government) tend to be extremely bureaucratic and as such getting work done can be a hassle sometimes (also, I've noticed they tend to foster that sort of individual, which I don't like as well).  I currently work at a large chemical company and the entire structure of it is not only mind boggling but it severely limits individual progress.  My hope is that by working for a consulting firm I wouldn't have to deal with red-tape issues as much.  Is this true?  What working environments have you enjoyed the most?"
AskNetsec,3cl8ml,unashamedgeek,2,Wed Jul 8 20:59:37 2015 UTC,"Consulting is what I enjoy the most, but I didn't expect that when I made the jump. I was put off of consulting because of the amount of travel that can come with it. However, I found a gig that works well for me. You're right that I have experienced less red tape, work silos, etc as a consultant because my time doesn't get wasted. My main interaction is with clients and they pay for my time so I don't get a lot of pulled into pointless meetings and such. I am a pen tester so I typically just test what is in scope, write up a report, and move on. There are some negatives to consulting too. There can be travel and it can be significant with some firms. There is higher turnover as people have it easy to leave and firms can fire people that don't make the cut quickly. People can leave easily because it is nothing to go with for another firm since the work is similar. And people can get fired quickly because you have to be billable to be profitable to the firm. I find it harder to take unexpected vacation or sick time. I'm scheduled to do with for a client in a specific timeframe so getting sick or taking a day off in the middle of the test doesn't really work very well. My workload has also been much more as a consultant. In a corporate gig all that red tape slows you down and gives you downtime and that doesn't happen in consulting.  Those are some thoughts off the top of my head."

AskNetsec,3clpz0,BlastedInTheFace,3,Wed Jul 8 22:38:45 2015 UTC,"Well, i'll tell you my opinion. Start studying and CLEPing classes now. If you aren't using the CCAF, you should really start. Get your OSCP. Save up and take the GPEN. You can challenge the exam for about $1000.  Build your own lab and do tests, get a job in Infosec (note I said infosec, don't limit yourself to pentesting) and go to school online, consider WGU as they will accept your certs for credits (College is Regionally accredited so no worries). If you CLEP/DSST out of most of your General education classes, you should be able to finish your degree within a year.  Despite what you may think/hear, degree's aren't really valued much in infosec. The primary qualification is experience then certifications, then degrees. I just got 2 calls today for pentesting jobs with major companies, no degree here, but I sure as hell have experience in security and a few pentesting certs.  An alternative option is to look at joining the military in a reserve cyber mos/afsc. This will get you infosec experience which you can use to build up your resume"
AskNetsec,3clpz0,BlastedInTheFace,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:07:11 2015 UTC,I have my CCAF. I've taken too many cleps to apply them all to my degree. I would switch to WGU but I don't want to start over.

If you want to do pen testing, I think CIS would be a great strength with certifications. If you want to go with law enforcement, I think the Criminal Justice degree would be best.  I'd also suggest that instead of looking at a master in MIS, go with a master in information security. But that again is optional and would help with the government or government contractor sector as they seem to value degrees the most.   I worked for the government and for a DoD contractor and they valued my degrees the most, followed by certifications. In the private sector working for a security team, I needed my bachelors degree and key certifications to get past their HR department. You will see CEH and CISSP certifications requested the most probably. I now work as a consultant and for hiring me, they cared about my experience and what I could actually do the most. However, once on-board they want more certs since that is what they can brag to clients about and justify different pricing models.

Some security companies have QR code scanners that try to match the URL against a blacklist, but that only works on already known URLs.  Change the URL and the blacklist fails.  Once you've gotten the device to look up the URL, security is then reliant on any network inspection solutions (firewall, NGFW, sandboxing, antivirus, IPS) and endpoint protection solutions."

AskNetsec,3ci3gi,NewShoes4U,7,Wed Jul 8 02:08:56 2015 UTC,"[Insert choice of higher power here] Help you! I've done Checkpoint Administration for longer then 12 years, so I can share some thoughts with you:  The books listed by /u/NewShoes4U are all way too old. The most current one was the R65, and that's 5+ years out of date, so I honestly wouldn't recommend any of them. [edit] Didn't see you were the poster and the first comment, sorry :)  Most of the training you're going to find is going to be classroom based and will cost money to attend. There isn't much in the way of self study literature wise. That being said check to see if there is a local Checkpoint Users Group (CPUG) near your town/city/hamlet; someone who's attended a recent class may lend you their materials which would be pretty current.  It does look like you can try their products now. They will work in a virtual environment no problems and as long as you have enough ram, you can setup a decent test environment. I've run 3 clusters with 2 management stations on 32GB of RAM and an 8 core proc. Disk IO was lagging but that's because it was all on the same spindle.  It looks like if you sign up, you can download a relatively recent version of their software to muck around with. Any of their fresh installs will give you two weeks gratis before you need a license.  Things maybe I wish I had known or what may be helpful to your self:   There are Two main operating systems at play   Secure Platform - This is a Linux (Red Hat) distribution that checkpoint as ported their software to. The OS layer is called Secure Platform and the firewall components are added via RPM just like any other RHEL based system. You should be pretty familiar with Linux, however Checkpoint does make a web gui available to you. It's not that great and command line is the way to go with this OS. This is or soon will be depreciated in favor of GAIA.  Gaia - Is also a Linux based (RHEL again, though much newer kernel) however a little history first. Checkpoint absorbed a former partner: Nokia Security Systems. Nokia took FreeBSD and ported the Checkpoint firewall to this platform they called IPSO. The IPSO platform had a really decent web GUI, however it really shined in the command line adopting a Cisco like shell that could configure every aspect of the OS/Firewall integration. Not wanting to maintain two systems, Checkpoint merged the best features from IPSO with the Linux operating system into what they call GAIA. This is the platform you will want to focus on if you're serious about learning Checkpoint.  I'll note that you can also run Checkpoint on Windows...I think that's cute and no one does it. I'll just leave it at that. You used to (maybe still can) run Checkpoint on Solaris. For many years this was the go to choice because Linux wasn't yet an option and no one who's serious about security uses a Fischer Price OS for their Enterprise.   Checkpoint came up with a silly marketing tactic called Software Blades.   I'm literally sighing while writing this because it's as stupid as it sounds. Many of us believe it was just an underhanded way of squeezing more money out of existing customers. Basically Checkpoint took each of the various software packages that make up it's suite of products and called them Blades or modules. Each Blade has a different license, cost and SKU. More on that later. They tout it as a way to get the items you may want/need ala cart. The community wasn't happy with the change.   Licensing   Licensing is always a complete PITA, the SKUs are amazingly confusing and the sales persons (at least in my experience) were never quite as helpful as they really should be. We always felt like we were getting screwed each time renewals came up.  Once you finally get the licenses, applying them used to be quite the pain. Some licenses you could only apply to the firewall nodes them selves, some could only be applied to the management nodes and still others to reporting nodes. This largely has changes with central licensing. You basically attach all the license to the manager(s) and then apply them to the various nodes via the Checkpoint GUI.   Management   There is really no management of the firewall from the command line. You wouldn't want to either because basically it's C structures and is compiled before being installed on the firewall nodes. The GUI has got a lot better over the years, way more stable then it was when I first started where sneezing would cause a blue screen. It's very powerful, however it can also be very daunting to people who are un-familar with the product. It's pretty logically laid out with Objects on the Left and Rules for NAT, Firewall etc on the right. The typical columns are Source, Destination, Protocol, Action and various comment fields. It makes for organizing your rule base in a tidy manner.  The GUI is windows only. There used to be a Solaris one, however I doubt this is still offered. Why no web or Linux GUI, I suspect because of the pervasiveness of Windows. I've had mixed results with running the management GUI in Wine on Linux. I'd not recommend it for production work.   TERMS / Lingo   The nodes that actually allow/drop packets are called various things: Enforcement Nodes, Firewalls, Security Gateways, Security Gateway Cluster.  The nodes that contain the policy and logs are generally referred to as Management and or Reporting nodes.  Objects are anything you can think of: Firewalls, user computers, routers, website URLs, etc. They are the basic building blocks of anything you want to do.  Groups are just what they advertise: Containers to put multiple objects in for making your rule set clear   Routing protocols   Anything you can think of is supported: BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, RIP (FFS it's in there), Policy Routing. You could actually replace your edge network routers with a checkpoint firewall and as long as you spec the hardware properly, it will handle full routing tables with ease. Your network guys may have other thoughts, however this is commonly done.   Check list of things you should be knowledgeable - intimate with:    Linux system administration. I don't mean, ``Yeah, I've installed Fedora in VMware workstation'' familiar, I mean, you don't blink when someone asks you to compile a kernel, special module or perform tuning on the TCP/IP stack or kernel it self. A firm foundation in network administration. Again, I don't mean someone who can add users to AD (yes I see jobs where these kinds of persons are called network admins), I'm talking about someone who knows the OSI layers in and out, can use tcpdump or wireshark/tshark to capture packets on multiple interfaces and then read through the stream and know what's going on. Security Practices. You should know what a stateful firewall is, what a basic security posture for an operating system should be, understand default drop firewall configurations. Application proxying and HA operation of these applications   I don't know if you're familiar with any other firewall technology or not. If you have some ASA experience a lot will seem right at home for you. At the same time you will also be quickly perplexed at the weird and wild ways in which packets appear and disappear at different interfaces. Training again is the suggestion or making friends at a local CPUG. You may also want to seriously consider Palo Alto firewalls. The company was founded by former Checkpoint luminaries and they seem to be getting a lot right with their offerings.  Cheers and good luck! [edited management section about the GUI]"

AskNetsec,3chxff,kebabgive,6,Wed Jul 8 01:18:53 2015 UTC,"You sound exactly like me 4 years ago. I was doing similar work myself, mainly system administration and network engineering work. I knew linux from the Army but it was a while since I used it. I didn't get laid off work but I was completely burned out doing sysadmin type things in a cubicle. I would switch jobs and then get tired of it 6 months later (or sooner). I needed that constant change and challenge. I was just about to switch to a different career altogether.  Anyhow, I started learning more about offensive security and really fell in love with it but it seemed impossible to do. I started digging around and decided to do the CEH course. Just bought the book (All-In-One) series book on amazon and passed it. It was a bit too easy. I later signed up for the Pentesting with Kali (PWK) course from Offensive Security to get my OSCP. I did the 3 month lab and learned an insane amount of things as I was passionate about it. I realized I was able to learn so much so quickly because of that passion. I later interviewed and got a job as a full-time security consultant (penetration tester).  To answer your questions, I absolutely love the job as I needed something that was new and challenging every week. As a penetration tester I get to do new assessments every week. Some last only a week and others around two. They range from hacking external sites/companies to internal assessments, web applications,  social engineering and more. I also worked 4 years as a locksmith in the Army and NEVER thought I'd use those skills again.  I just got back from an assessment in D.C. where I had to sneak into a high profile building (just a few blocks from the white house), get past the guards and then hack them from within. I had ten days total to do this. I got to disguise myself as an electronic technician to ""test a new circuit"" inside the server room. A bit of talking and social engineering and some homework done before (names, locations, company that normally handles this work, etc) and I was in. I was Domain Admin within a handful of hours. I later came back in at around 5-6pm when people were leaving dressed like a typical IT guy. Found a few empty offices and even Social Engineered a few passwords from employees who were there a bit late. I said I was there to update computers and that I needed their password, etc. Anyhow, tons of fun.  I've been with this company for a few years now and don't really have any complaints. We go to Vegas twice a year; once for Defcon and the other for our ""team meetup"" to see everyone and ""bond"". Basically a drink/party fest.   There isn't much I don't like. As a penetration tester you get to hack but you still have to write a report at the end. Some of the big assessments it can be a pain to hurry and write the report and have it ready by the beginning of the next week. BUT, my company gives us lots of time off for research and personal time as they know the work is demanding. (1 week off ~6-8 weeks). Plus they have no set amount of vacation days. Just be responsible and take days when you need them.   I know many people are either for or against certs but I think they are important to have not only for the knowledge but it looks good on your resume. I have to say though, NEVER study for the test to just get the cert, actually learn and understand the material. You have to have a solid foundation of knowledge (which you seem to have). Focus on the exact position that you want.   For example, do you want to do pentesting or work doing forensics or security analyst job, etc? If it is penetration testing, you should really learn all you can. The big cert that is popular and EXTREMELY helpful is the OSCP. I did the 3 month lab and though it seemed expensive (and it is), it was worth every penny and more. In fact, it helped me land my first pentesting job. The cert is all hands on and the test is no questions, all hands-on with a 24 hour time limit. The hiring mangers who know about it and have it respect people who have it as they know the challenge of getting it. You'll go from writing easy/basic bash scripts to creating your own custom buffer overflows to exploit servers.   So first ask yourself what position and then figure out what you need to learn to be the best at it. Also, attitude is everything and hiring managers look for guys who want to learn - who posses that deep desire to learn even on their own. If  you show that to them, you should have no problem."

AskNetsec,3chxff,NetSecPentester,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:02:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed reply.   I think I would get the most enjoyment out of the pentesting/assessment type of gig. I very much enjoy analysis and looking at problems holistically to find solutions (or weaknesses), I think with enough practice & experience it's something I could become legitimately good at.  I think about some of the places that I've worked, and can easily think of 10 different ways to compromise those networks (a variety of social, physical,  and network based attacks). Of course as an infrastructure analyst your always trying to build things in a secure manner, but sometimes you just don't have the clout or budget to actually eliminate or reduce these weaknesses, and you can't always convince executives that something is needed when you are telling them its a risk, but can't prove it or easily quantify how bad it is. If it was my job to find these holes, write reports and recommendations, I think I would find it very rewarding.  I assume it has taken you a lot of hard work and time to get where you are now, but your job sounds like a blast. As with any job I'm sure there are some boring parts (report writing, etc.), but it seems that pentesting would be one of the more exciting infosec disciplines.   Tell me if I'm wrong, but doing forensics or working as a security analyst seems like they would both have signficantly more monotony (especially the forensics). I'm the kind of person who is always looking for new challenges and constantly learning, so I think the pentesting/security assessment path would suit  me better.  I have heard of OSCP and CEH, and I'm actually considering taking a contract job that will give me great pay and lots of free time for about a year.   If you had an entire year, with pretty light hours of work, what else would you recommend doing? It sounds like CEH would be a quick kill and I would also have lots of time to do the OSCP."
AskNetsec,3chxff,NetSecPentester,2,Wed Jul 8 17:49:38 2015 UTC,"Yea I spend a 1.5 years as a security analyst and it got old real quick. I've heard that working as a forensics guy is also like that but it might be different depending where you work. I spent the first few hours of the day as a security analyst going over logs. Logs and logs and logs. Even with software parsing out various things it is boring to sit and start at. It is good to still see that type of position and knowing how the defense works makes you better offensive (and vise-versa).  Penetration testing is exciting. Every week it is a new challenge and you get to basically be your own boss in how you approach it. Everyone is a bit different so you get to be creative.  Social Engineering will always be the easiest way in to any organization. No matter how much training a company gives it will always be their soft spot. If an attacker does enough homework they can eventually get in by at least one person making a mistake. If I send out 100 emails there will always be at least one who opens it and clicks on the link. During my last social engineering (SE) assessment I sent out emails and sent out malicious excel files that return connections via a macro with powershell inside it (avoids anti-virus). There was a step where I had to have them click to enable the macro - that is where the SE came into play. I also dropped CDs and thumbdrives around their office and had a malicious file with the name of SpringBreakPhotos2015.jpg.exe. Normally by default, Windows hides the extension when viewing files so in this case a normal user would typically see SpringBreakPhotos2015.jpg and not the "".exe"" part. They will click on it most of the time as they are eager to see who is in the photos. I would be sitting externally waiting for connections and would definitely get a lot even security staff.  Yea the CEH is easy. Please don't get any other official course ware from them. Just get the amazon All-In-One book to study. It is a great book to read and it is all you need. Basically the important stuff out of the CEH is just learning the methodology. The OSCP is where the meat and potatoes are at. That is where you will really learn. As a security analyst I had a lot of time to kill at my last job and they let me study when nothing was going on. Plus, if someone passed by it looked like I was crazy busy as I was in Offsec's lab pwning some machines. I'd highly recommend getting their 90 day lab. You'll thank me later. You will learn a tremendous amount from that course and it will propel you to the next level. Within a year I went from knowing I can't do pentesting (especially after taking the CEH as I was still very lost) to filling out applications for a pentester position. I basically got my first pentesting job after they saw I got my OSCP."

AskNetsec,3chxff,qwerpoiu43210,2,Wed Jul 8 18:34:09 2015 UTC,"Depending on what you're going for.... SANS 503 for Analyst, SANS 504 for Incident Management certifications (there is one for pen testing too). Study the topics, get the cert after employment (or some like CEH or CISSP). Download Splunk and get use to the syntax, some places might use a SIEM like ArcSight, Nitro, or some other solution (Netwitness). RSA Archer platform, if you want case management ideas. Wireshark is a must for PCAPs, or something like Network Miner depending on preference.  Love the ability to pivot on tangents (continual discovery)... hate the repetitive nature of analysis.   Know networking (DNS, Windows event logs, IDS, Linux (rhel), malware techniques, compliance/access management, AD/gpo basics).

AskNetsec,3ciklc,jorgon1022,5,Wed Jul 8 04:43:49 2015 UTC,"First you need to get into or learn IT. Not just security but systems. You need to gain experience working on systems. That means get your but on a helpdesk or a sysadmin job. Once you get some experience, save your money and start getting relevant IT certs. Eventually you need to figure out what area of security you'd like to get into.  Since you said Infosec analyst, i'll tell you that generally relates to IDS analysis. Go on amazon and start reading well rated books on packet analysis, build a lab and start practicing. Learn programming. Eventually you will want to get security focused certs for your area, however there aren't many for defense. The GCIA is most relevant, alternatively Cisco has the SCYBER exam with relevant course."

AskNetsec,3ciklc,BlastedInTheFace,3,Wed Jul 8 12:19:47 2015 UTC,"Experience in IT with a demonstrated interest in security. This isn't a field that takes people off the street.

AskNetsec,3ciklc,BlastedInTheFace,3,Wed Jul 8 12:28:42 2015 UTC,"Virtually. There are occasionally entry level positions, but you are competing against others more qualified, it could be difficult. If you are determined to do so, you need to get certs now. You need to differentiate yourself between everyone else trying to qualify on education alone.  My suggestions are the Security+ and the CEH. They will show the baseline of knowledge you will need. Virtually any security position will require a base cert before you move on to more advanced ones.  Once you get those, I would advise setting up a lab. In your lab you can practice and showcase your skills. Start looking at Security analyst positions, see what they are looking for and start getting that experience."

AskNetsec,3ciklc,lulzmachine,2,Wed Jul 8 15:32:40 2015 UTC,"Well the issue is that people assume that security = hacking. Its just not true. People want a single path and the fact is that security doesn't work that way. There is network defense which can include security architecture and engineering, intrusion detection, as well as Information assurance, and incident handling. Malware analysis often is in there too. There is offensive security which can include vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, exploit development, ect.  Intelligence is also merging with Infosec as well requiring a different skillset.  As you can imagine, all of these different fields have different requirements. I can personally tell you that if you try to go from one area of security to another in many companies, its not going to happen until you go back and meet the requirements and qualifications for the new role, including experience.  It's a simple truth that a lot of people here don't want to admit, the OSCP and offensive security are not all of security."

It will take time, but if you are really interested, it will be worth it. It's a field that requires constant learning and is not a good fit for someone who wants a mindless job.

Speaking just of the protocol (SSLv3/TLS1/TLS1.1/TLS1.2) there are a number of old browsers that don't support the latest TLS1.2 (the currently ""secure"" TLS version); see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Web_browsers. Additionally, there are situations (super hypothetical here, but trying to load/parse reddit on an Arduino) where there isn't enough ram/cpu power to do TLS.  EDIT 1: Also to add, reddit could support a expansive set of protocols and ciphersuits to reduce the number of users that may be impacted by forcing HTTPS, but doing so would expose all the users to the security issues identified with those protocols/ciphers which would defeat the purpose of implementing HTTPS in the first place (and may actually be worse than using HTTP by giving a false sense of security to users)."

It uses an interactive menu. That's on my to do list though  Lazy math: 13 bits of entropy per word from my script. 2*26 letters plus 10 numbers plus maybe like 26 random symbols gives 88 possibilities per digit. Call it 6.5 bits of entropy per digit and say two of your digits are worth one of my words. I have 7 words you have 16 digits. Add in the random character from my script and we are in the same ballpark.

AskNetsec,3cao55,woprdotmil,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:29:36 2015 UTC,Well take IE for example. It will do a DNS lookup itself to check if the ip is in the proxy exception list and go direct. Otherwise it will just do a GET via the proxy. Things do get a little more complex if you are using WPAD/PAC proxy auto config but it does not change the fundamental situation that the proxy is doing the DNS lookup for any requests it gets..

AskNetsec,3c82av,Fen-Jai,9,Sun Jul 5 19:48:51 2015 UTC,"Looking at the CDN providers mentioned in this thread would be a good start. But they will mostly be working against network level attacks. They will be doing some analysis on the requests and allowing some/dropping others. A lot of this also comes down to just having more bandwidth.  But if you're running a propitiatory application, you will often need a customized solution. I have done a lot of work against mitigating Layer 7 DDoS attacks. The first thing to note is, if your attacker is mimicking user activity on your website using a script that clicks through multiple pages as part of it's attack, the best way to stop this before it starts is with a captcha. Depending on your specific application, you may also benefit from a Cross Site Request Forgery Filter. Implementations on this differ from web server to web server, but the way this works is you define entry points to your application, and define how users can navigate between resources. This doesn't always provide much return though.  If they are attacking your API, then the solution I go to is putting the traffic through an Apache reverse proxy, and using IP Tables + Fail2ban. Fail2ban reads logs and bans IP addresses that matches to regex search patterns which you define. The basic approach is when <IP> does <action> <number of time> in <period> then ban for <amount of time>. You look for things like excessive number of requests, authentication failures, requests from too many different user accounts. The attacker can try to learn your rules and develop their attack if they are persistent, so this approach requires constant review and analysis to meet your specific requirements.   Another good tool to have is geo-blocking. There is a good chance that attacks will originate from places that you do not service with your application, or from places that you don't need to service. So blocking certain regions at all times, or blocking certain regions when you are specifically under attack can go a long way to mitigate certain attackers.  Also, make sure you separate the components of your application. You want your proxy/web server/application server/database to all be on different machines. That way, if one of them gets overloaded, you don't bring your whole system down."
AskNetsec,3c82av,HansomMan,6,Mon Jul 6 02:40:08 2015 UTC,"You probably mean mitigation, not prevention. You can look at how Cloudflare does it.

I am doing this at the login screen with bogus login credentials btw, as it should bypass it anyway if I nail the correct session?  They aren't telling me to do anything.

AskNetsec,3c96j8,NetSecPentester,2,Tue Jul 7 00:33:12 2015 UTC,"Oh shit. I know exactly which one you are on now lol. It is a HUGE pain in the ass. I think you were very close to getting it. So let's go over it and I will tell you why it is damn near impossible to get. First just know that even though you pay for your session and you are logged in to their lab, you aren't the only one on it. So lets say you log in to the practice site ""Nice and Easy"" (331). You log in as admin and you view the settings for the other users. You see their UID and on another page you see their session. Notice that if you refresh periodically different sessions are generated. This is NOT generated randomly as part of the lab but from various people around the world logging in and practicing.   If you take the admin cookie and throw it in the decoder you will notice after decoding in hex something like this:  username=admin|uid=35|timestamp=635718338096987553  Right?  Before decoding it looks like this:  757365726E616D653D61646D696E7C7569643D33357C74696D657374616D703D36333537313833333830393639383735353\  So we know that the first two thirds of this will always be the same and only the timestamp= ""X"" will be different for ""X"". So when you place this in sequencer you will see that it is quite weak.   Basically the only part that changes is the:  36333537313833333830393639383735353  out of the   757365726E616D653D61646D696E7C7569643D33357C74696D657374616D703D36333537313833333830393639383735353  Note that every time you run this in sequencer the amount of requests are quite fast and it increments. It increments so quickly you might not be able to predict or catch it with incrementing as many other people are doing similar test but the timestamp increments fast. You have to find a pattern in the timestamp. Using another browser, log in as the admin. The BIG thing to remember is not thinking about hitting the future number it is knowing that someone has already hit the previous number and is logged in with a session. So you should be trying less numbers to guess and connect to sessions already in play.  So you have the right idea for sure, you aren't wrong it is just timing and luck. Don't sweat it. You are doing it exactly right  Just like the one ""Used to happen all the time"". This one just increments by 4. So you can try various numbers by 4. It is also incrementing in Hex so you would count 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F . Because it increments by 4, you would have intruder (payload) start at a number (~8 less than yours) and then increment by 4. So lets say you have the cookie right now as   855281EC53B169  You would start from 855281EC53B161 in the number range and end (To:) at 855281EC53B188 and set the ""step"" at 4.  Put the min integer at 0 and max integer at F and put the Base at ""Hex"". If all goes well and ""IF"" someone is on a session you should see a status 200. Hope that helps.   Just remember that new sessions generate new cookies. While there are some that increment only when a user logs in, others increment by time or other means. The one you were stuck on increments by time and it is just harder to catch."
AskNetsec,3c8f21,Devdo5,3,Sun Jul 5 21:37:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly it really depends on what you want to do/specialize in and what you already know and feel comfortable about.   With pentesting you can at times be required to know the following:   Networking System Administration (think ""best practice"") Programming Web Application Dev Physical Security Hardware etc   There is a TON to learn and I tell everyone that it is beyond important to learn the basics/fundamentals first and then you can specialize in something. I came from a system administration background (mainly) but I originally started off in the Army where I learned component level electronics. I also worked as a locksmith for 4 years. Part of my Army training was to fix Army military intelligence systems so I also learned Linux (Sun Solaris) during my training.   If all you want to do is dabble in it and mess around then sure go right for the metasploit and kali books etc but you will hit a hard wall quickly afterwards with going forward to more advanced topics.  If you are serious about becoming a real pentester then you should learn networking, system administration, web applications, some programming at a minimum. System administration can be important because you need to know how something is ""suppose"" to be configured in order to spot misconfigurations or weak configurations in a customers environment.   Everyone on my team has a specialty. I never did programming when first starting out as I just didn't have a need for it in the past but some of our guys are aces at it. I still learned the basics like assembly, C, (a little C++), Java, and Python but I'm very basic at it. I have my MCSE but started with my A+, Network+, Security+ from Comptia. I later started doing Microsoft classes and taking tests one by one (MS tests are some of the hardest). From there I got my CCNA-S and then I eventually got my OSCP from Offensive Security. That should be your real goal (OSCP).  You will learn tons from that course but you should go in knowing some Linux CLI and some networking first. I later wanted to get my OSCE from Offensive Security but realized I knew nothing about assembly nor did I know anything about C language, etc. So I learned that and a year later took and passed the class.   Netsec is getting more broad so the real question for you is what do you want to do exactly and also what do you know right now? Do you have any certs right now?  One cert I would say to stay away from is the CEH. It is nice to have one the resume and say you have the title but that is it. The All-In-One book for CEH is more than enough to pass that test and really it is extremely outdated and practically useless. 99% windows usage and using programs that are either obsolete or not even existing anymore. The ONLY good thing from that course is learning the methodology for pentesting but you can learn that on you own.   Some universities offer Netsec degrees now. I am going back to school myself using my GI Bill and I am attending UAT (University of Advancing Technology) online. It is expensive though but I decided to go as I'm using the GI Bill. I met them at the last Defcon. If you plan to go to Defcon or Blackhat they will be there.   I think the OSCP is by far the best you will get for your money. Other courses that are crazy expensive and only last a few days like SAN courses won't really teach you a ton if those few days. While the OSCP with 3 months of labs can be pricey it is worth every penny. I got my first full-time pentesting job right after getting that cert."

Go slow and low. In this case, metasploit can make the test harder, since metasploit excels at set-it-and-forget-it. To get around an IDS/IPS, you have to be smart, slow, and stealthy."

I would keep port 135 closed, but might keep port 22 open. Send your Windows attack on that port.   They suggest spoofing the source IP address, and one consequence of that is spoofing the IP address to be something that is allowed to scan the network (like their Nessus box).   They also say it takes time and skill, and still will be difficult. Like I said.   Slow and low is safer, because a normal person might fail their login five times in ten minutes. A human would never fail to log in five times in two seconds. Computers are trained to look for that. Chances are an IDS might not be programmed to look for that because of all of the false positives it would generate.   No, I don't think IDS systems are stupid.

Re: Nessus - the idea is not to get the results of their Nessus scan but rather to pretend to be their Nessus server. Because likely they have an exception in their IDS for their own internal scanner, so it doesn't get blocked. If you pretend to be their scanner and use their IP address, you can take advantage of that same exception."

You need to use a port that would be open, but not default for that attack. An IDS is based on rules, and to evade it you have to make sure your attack is not triggering those rules. If the rule specifies that a Windows attack will come in on a Windows port and it comes in on the SSH port, you've just evaded it (for a simple example).   But then again, your response was ""you can't do it, don't try"". So I'm not sure why you're even here other than to troll people actually trying to learn.

Look at also implementing processes around putting new servers/devices into the environment. Something like a scan and review to make sure what you are putting in is up to par. Speaking of which, make sure all of your system types have hardening guides. This all is a lot of work but if you can pull it off and put on your resume it will be of great help to you in the future.   One you have cleanish vuln scans coming back, defined processes and procedures, and management support then go get a pen test to see what things the vuln scan misses and if you can detect a real world attack. I would push them to pay for you to get OSCP because then you get a better grasp as to what an attacker can do and how. Pen testing isn't really something you can get good at without a lot of experience and frankly that is hard to get from the kind of position you have now.

You may need to specify the absolute path to the putty executable in the exe option of the payload   Depending on what filesystems you're using on the VMs the putty file may have its zone identifier ADS set to 3 which could prevent execution.

So for the benefit of anyone else reading, to flush DNS cache on OS X Yosemite, you need to do the following:  sudo discoveryutil mdnsflushcache sudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches   I'm not sure why Opera wasn't affected but do recall that it does something different when loading up pages to speed up performance."

Once every year, at dawn on April 30th, this tree blossoms, with five flowers, and over the next hour each blossom becomes a berry, first a green berry, then black, then golden.  At the moment the five berries become golden, five white crows, who have been waiting on the mountain, and which you will have mistaken for snow, will swoop down on the tree, greedily stripping it of all its berries, and will fly off, laughing.  You must catch, with your bare hands, the smallest of the crows, and you must force it to give up the berry (the crows do not swallow the berries. They carry them far across the ocean, to an enchanter’s garden, to drop, one by one, into the mouth of his daughter, who will wake from her enchanted sleep only when a thousand such berries have been fed to her). When you have obtained the golden berry, you must place it under your tongue, and return directly to your home.  For the next week, you must speak to no-one, not even your loved ones or a highway patrol officer stopping you for speeding. Say nothing. Do not sleep. Let the berry sit beneath your tongue.  At midnight on the seventh day you must go to the highest place in your town (it is common to climb on roofs for this step) and, with the berry safely beneath your tongue, recite the whole of Fox in Socks. Do not let the berry slip from your tongue. Do not miss out any of the poem, or skip any of the bits of the Muddle Puddle Tweetle Poodle Beetle Noodle Bottle Paddle Battle.  Then, and only then, can you swallow the berry. You must return home as quickly as you can, for you have only half an hour at most before you fall into a deep sleep.  When you wake in the morning, you will become able to make multiple accounts on a website or forum and not be detected as the person making them, have an account deleted, have accounts merged, or be banned from the website altogether, and bypass a ban if it happens."

Even if, for example, the RSA soft-token were compromised, typically the token is being used for the auth for something else (e.g. PC remote or PC VPN authentication). Unless the attacker also has full control over both the PC and the mobile device, then logically it would not be possible to know if/when/who was authenticating, so having the token does not help the attacker. (this would be like if the attacker found a SecurID token on the ground--that's great, but whose is it, and what is it being used for?) And of course if being used properly, stealing only one-factor of 2FA is not useful. While obviusly the risk-level is raised if the 2FA authenticator is being used for an application on the same device (e.g. Google Authenticator on ipad for Gmail on ipad), if the device/token were compromised the attacker would, theoretically, have something useful, however this would also require a keystroke logger and/or access to cached device credentials (it's still 2FA). Overall, if the attacker got this far, stealing/replaying the authenticator is the least of your worries.  Would also add that this might be a good argument for an enterprise using soft-tokens to add additional controls. Such as enforcing mobile device configuration policies via a MDM solution for BYOD as well as config policies for company-issued-devices. A jailed device with appropriate security restrictions would be less vulnerable; and if/when malware becomes prevalent, the appropriate countermeasures would need to be deployed (e.g. AV)."

SMS is not secure, and is somewhat clunky for people to use. Your users would rebel and you're only gaining the cost benefits of not managing an authenticator.    The world is moving on from just having an authenticator for access. Some systems are marrying a device profile with a risk engine, an authenticator on separate channel, geolocation and biometrics under one solution. Layered defense when done seamlessly can elevate your security posture by an order of magnitude. Might wanna check out RSA's ""VIA"" service."
AskNetsec,3bsovt,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:12:39 2015 UTC,"What would be ideal would be if the system could use SMS as a fallback method if the system had evidence it was being attacked (e.g. multiple failed logins or other metadata such as different geolocation). Of course the flaw with SMS would be if someone had complete ownership of the remote device, then that would, theoretically include SMS."
AskNetsec,3bsovt,covertc,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:21:02 2015 UTC,A good SMS token system would incorporate a PIN so it could be theoretically resistant to an owned mobile. Also another facet of a good fallback SMS solution should include a rapid and easy way to provision them out to people en masse.
AskNetsec,3bsovt,PwdRsch,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:13:10 2015 UTC,"Using MFA on a personal mobile device tends to be less secure than a dedicated MFA device (e.g. SecurID token), but it tends to be cheaper and easier to use in some scenarios.  For most corporate or consumer services using mobile MFA seems reasonably secure, although that will depend on the vendor's implementation."
AskNetsec,3bsovt,InfoSecGeek,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:02:02 2015 UTC,"OTOH, to get to the SecurID token OTP, you just look at the screen of the device, and it's fairly obvious what you have in your hand (since it's got the RSA logo on it). On a mobile device you would have to first unlock the device, and launching the token-app requires a PIN. This assumes attacker has prior knowledge that mobile device has application installed on it. While of course being able to compromise all this remotely adds a whole new twist, but when comparing apples-to-apples (no pun intended) I would say they are about the same."
AskNetsec,3bsovt,PwdRsch,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:18:29 2015 UTC,"The difference is that a OTP token device is dedicated to its singular purpose.  It can't get compromised (save a highly technically skilled attacker with physical access to it) or backdoored or anything else that a general purpose operating system can.  However, it's also less convenient to carry around and more expensive (assuming you don't incur the cost of buying users their mobile devices).  I don't think mobile MFA is a bad idea, but we have to face facts that it takes more effort to make sure it doesn't get compromised."

AskNetsec,3bnsmd,kizzzzurt,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:00:12 2015 UTC,"DoS attacks typically aren't the problem and DoS could be even as simple as tripping over a plug and pulling it out of the wire causing a denial of servie (DoS). A DDoS is usually the issue and they come from so many places, IPs, and often from an array of signatures.  The only way an IPS can stop things is if it doesn't look like typical traffic or is of a certain signature."
AskNetsec,3bnsmd,ZombieHousefly,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:41:14 2015 UTC,"Firewalls and IPSs are just specialized computers. They take input (incoming network packets), analyze them, and may produce output (more networked packets, usually just copies of the incoming ones). Hit it with enough input, and it can't analyze them at a rate greater than the incoming packets. At this point they either fail open (just let the packets through) or fail closed (block/drop packets), both of which have disadvantages. Failing open could lead to a security breach, and failing closed results in a denial of service. (simplified, of course)"
AskNetsec,3bnsmd,PM_ME_NICE_THOUGHTS,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:30:26 2015 UTC,As others have said a firewall is the wrong tool for the job. A switch could be configured to send all packets from the offending addresses to a blackhole. This still doesn't stop the lines from being over saturated with data which does prevent any stable connection from forming.
AskNetsec,3bnsmd,tomtomgunner,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:02:09 2015 UTC,"I assume you're talking about a layer 4 DDoS attack because DoS is a very broad term. Plus, even with L4 DDoS you're still going to come across more difficult to distinguish attacks, for instance a botnet spidering a website then performing an attack distributed through the various pages is very hard to distinguish from legitimate use In terms of layer 7 attacks, they are attacking the application by definition, and therefore have already passed the firewall because they are identical to legitimate traffic. IPSes can only really be effective if they can evolve faster than the attacks, because it is very difficult to keep up with new attack vectors in applications"

AskNetsec,3biwlt,siliconmon,4,Mon Jun 29 21:14:06 2015 UTC,"I was a pro intrusion analyst a few years ago. Heres how to learn a lot and unintentionally make everyone around you and the security software look like shit.   Step 1. Learn if you havent already how corp networks are owned. Familiarize yourself with common command and control (c2) beacons and what they usually look like. You cant find anything if you dont know what you're looking for. Oh and all networks are owned, never believe otherwise. So they're there, just gotta find em.   Step 2. Start looking into the low-hanging fruit thats easiest to catch traction with. Crimeware (banking trojans) are great for this. Learn Zbot, dyre..etc indicators and look for them. These families are always missed by AV if they're a recent compile. Hids would probably get them but I dont know what you guys have. Learn what the most common spam zip attachment names are and look for those on disk. Fake airline tickets, ups tracking doc..etc. Read popular trojan news, spam report campaigns etc daily to keep your minds eye sharp. This stuff changes faster than your security nodes can. Gotta be quick.   Step 3. Find full featured trojans (darkcomet) and other custom backdoor shells easily by only looking for dynamic dns domain traffic. A normal end user employee will likely never have coms with a dyn dns like no-ip. Usually only high security networks globally block dyn dns so chances are high if you see traffic, you've got an infected box or someones checking their nanny cams. If you do have dyn dns globally blocked, still check for dns lookups! Just because the implant cant get out doesnt mean you wont see it try.   Step 4. Prophet (sic).   There are tons other crafty ways you can find stuff missed by everything and everyone else. Just depends on how creative you like to get. Like I said before, even on the most locked down systems, there are and will always be intruders. Want to be the guy who finds one?"

You could potentially kiss your job goodbye if you 'oops' it and bring the server down which runs a critical app.  Testing for default credentials is pretty much never going to bring a system down but I err on the side of caution when doing other activities.  Also, when you say FTP is blocked, do you mean that FTP is blocked at the network egress/ingress points?

This works with all Windows applications and for the target applications it's not possible to distinguish between real keypresses and the ones simulated by Auto-Type.

With anything, you need to weigh the effort required to achieve the goal.   Firefox leaks data. All browsers do. They send your user-agent string to help websites identify what plugins you've got so that they can serve you the best experience. That user-agent string is identifiable. It is also editable. You can use tools like ""User Agent Override"" to make it something common. Keep in mind that if you say you're windows running flash, you'll get content designed for that, and things will break.  You decide if that hassle is worth it.  Searching: Use Duckduckgo. There are other options out there, but it falls into the ""good enough"" category for me.  Don't use Flash, Facebook, G+, etc. Any of those social networks you use will share information about you.  PrivateInternetAccess, and other VPN providers are only good if you trust them. They claim to not log, but, really, it's impossible to know. The moment your traffic leaves your physical control, you have to start trusting folks.  You can use https://panopticlick.eff.org/ to see just how ""unique"" you are. Keep in mind that even if you eradicate any and all identifying marks from traffic you place on the web, the ""lack"" of marks will work just the same.   If you're tying to keep yourself relatively safe online, you can use a privacy minded browser, and remove plugins.  If you're trying to avoid being profiled, etc, then you've done enough so far.  If you're trying to keep yourself from getting ""hacked"" then keep ipfw/iptables (Sorry, I think Arch uses ipfw, but I'm not positive) and drop any inbound connections. Keep all your apps patched, and don't use any suspicious websites, download warez, etc. Same thing as you'd do on Windows.  If you're trying to avoid government spying on you, good luck. There are things you can do to make it more difficult, like the VPN, but they can always tap your local connection, see that you're using PIA for VPN service, and then send over a NSL. Then they just tap your info at PIA's exit points. I strongly doubt that you're going to be subject to that level of scrutiny.  There are ever-increasing levels of paranoia, like using pre-paid burner credit cards you get from different gas stations, bought with cash, in a ever-increasing radius from your house. Going to coffee shops with free wifi, using USB wifi dongles, booting off a live CD, and then shredding the wifi dongle when you're done.  It all comes down to what are you trying to accomplish, and how much time, energy, and money, are you willing to spend to make it happen."

Either way someone is going to eventually assess that you are listening for ssh on that port if they can connect and start guessing your usernames and passwords.  The need to be right all the time when the other guy only has to be right once is reason for the approach of layered controls that I am recommending.  Maximize the quality of the passwords or use multifactor auth, minimize the amount of valid logins, log and assess failed login attempts, throttle the amount of guesses that can be made per source IP per unit time, encrypt communication whenever possible, exclude all IP space from which connections are not expected, provide additional controls for superuser accounts, disable any other services that can be exploited and wrap the whole mess in a local firewall."

There's an information security principle of Secure By Default which is aimed just at the issue OP brings up. We know that security is hard to get right and there's been significant leaps in the last few years to ensure software is indeed secure(ish) by default.

AskNetsec,3b8pju,minecrater1,2,Sat Jun 27 04:14:05 2015 UTC,"With the inbuilt XSS filtering, especially in Chrome -- it does a pretty good job, it's almost pointless to demonstrate POCs for XSS in modern browsers. My suggestion is to keep an older browser installed to develop POCs on for that issue. If the concern is building a working POC against the current release of popular browsers, prepare to do legwork.  As well, use an intercepting proxy (like burp) to deliver payloads, to avoid any browser interference. This goes for things like UNICODE, SQLi... other types of injections. When testing a web app, the browser just gets in the way.  It's been my experience that browsers do that encoding only back to the address bar once the URL has been submitted, and if you look at the request with a proxy, you'll see the single tick unencoded. As well, even if your single tick gets encoded, it should get decoded before it hits your SQLi vector. I'd analyze whether or not this is actually a problem first."
AskNetsec,3b8pju,aydiosmio,5,Sat Jun 27 05:50:01 2015 UTC,"It's been my experience that browsers do that encoding only back to the address bar once the URL has been submitted, and if you look at the request with a proxy, you'll see the single tick unencoded.   My experience has been the opposite. For example, I just requested:  https://www.reddit.com/?'""<foobar>   In Firefox proxied through Burp. The request went through, and the URL in the address bar remained the same. Burp saw it fly out as:  GET /?%27%22%3Cfoobar%3E HTTP/1.1    As well, even if your single tick gets encoded, it should get decoded before it hits your SQLi vector. I'd analyze whether or not this is actually a problem first.   Yep, for SQLi it shouldn't be a problem - the URL should be decoded before being thrown to the DBMS. For something like XSS, it's not uncommon to find non-persistent XSS that comes straight from the URL submitted and on to the page.  For example, the injection point might look like:  <img src=""/images/$USER_INPUT_FILENAME"">   If the server is stripping angle brackets, but letting double quotes go through, then doing this using Burp or curl:  GET /page.php?filename=asdfhjkl""/onerror=""alert(1)   Would result in:  <img src=""/images/asdfhjkl""/onerror=""alert(1)"">   Which gives NP-XSS, at least in Firefox.  However, Firefox URL-encodes double quotes before sending to the server, and if the server is injecting into the src attribute without url decoding it first, you'd end up with:  <img src=""/images/asdfhjkl%22/onerror=%22alert(1)"">   No bueno if you can't find a way to have your victim send the double quote raw and unencoded. I've heard that trickery with 300 redirects might let you keep the quotes unencoded... But I haven't looked in to it."

AskNetsec,3b87mz,Rootkitz,2,Sun Jun 28 01:44:55 2015 UTC,"Pentesting is pretty straightforward to get into, but you'll need to focus more on actual offensive security training and not just security training aimed at network admins (like Security+). From what I've seen, OSCP tends to be the certification most recognized by recruiters, with SANS cetifications (GPEN, GCIA, etc) not following far behind. They're expensive certifications, but the right employer will pay for you to get them.  Apart from certifications, compete in CTFs and run your own home lab to practice on. ""What kind of network setup do you run at home?"" has been a question I've had in every security interview I've done. A candidate that runs Raspberry Pis, Kali, a router they put OpenWRT on, and a server they spin up VMs on (some of which they practice breaking into) stands out compared to someone who just runs a couple Windows desktops on a wireless network. You'd also be surprised at how much weight ""I like to compete in security CTFs"" has, even if you aren't placing in the top ranks.  Also, get good at writing. As glamorous as penetration testing sounds, it's usually only about 30% or less actual auditing, and 70% or more report writing. In fact, lots of the entry-level penetration testing jobs are as simple as running automated scans (ex. Nessus) with specific profiles, and then doing write-ups of the results for clients. Things can get more interesting once you're off the ground floor, but report writing always remains an important part of the process.  Malware analysis is more complicated, and depends largely on what type of analysis you want to be doing. If you're looking at basic forensics (like working in a SOC), you don't need advanced malware analysis skills so much as you need basic incident response and technical support skills, which it sounds like you'll have from your current role and schooling. In these roles, an alert goes off that a system has been infected/intruded, and you are the responder that finds the machine and remediates the issue. You won't be firing up IDA Pro or sandboxing malware samples so much as you'll be using basic analysis (strings, ProcMon, etc) and device logs to figure out what happened, and then cleaning the machine.   The research side of malware analysis- pulling the samples and dissecting their inner workings- can be hard to get into. People I know in these roles tend to have experience with low-level programming (ASM), advanced degrees or experience in computer science/engineering, private mailing lists/sources they get threat intelligence from (seriously), and a breadth of overall experience in network security. Most of them also run blogs or websites they publish their findings on. I've seen a few companies looking for entry-level malware analysts that only have the programming experience and a Bachelor's, but generally speaking, these research positions are not entry-level."

It may or may not be against the github ToS (I honestly have no clue); but, let's not confuse that with a law please. Posting exploit code is a common practice for helping to educate the rest of the community about how an exploit works.  Posting full up malware code is done for the same reason.  One of the most important things that security experts can do is understand how systems will be attacked.  It's the old axiom, ""know your enemy"".

Secure AJAX Authentication without SSL http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/265305/Secure-Ajax-Authentication-without-SSL http://todo.ly/apiwiki/?authentication/basic-authentication   The flaw/hack in this sort of thing is not the length/strength of the hash, but how the integrity of the exchange is preserved, such as how the server side validates input.  So if the attacker can steal or set the session ID, then the fact that he cannot guess the ID is a moot point (ergo, what problem are you trying to solve).  So, for example, if the application allows a POST to get flipped to a GET, then all the obfuscation goes out the window. Overall using PKI key-pairs for symmetric encryption is preferable to hashing (e.g. the RSA Javascript library or jsccryptolib is a simpler way to do this).     https://code.google.com/p/jscryptolib/ If what you're doing is something like .net, then nevermind."

First, the BP is a privacy appliance. User control over features and functions is a big deal in our culture. Always try to frame the device in that context. Further, I suggest separating your question into data at rest (eg on the handset) and data in transit (eg applications).  SilentOS, like other AOSP forks, offers full disk encryption right from the initial provisioning wizard. If you would like additional data at rest resilience you can access apps we internally vet through Silent Store. Additionally, the BP offers fully transparent mgmt of app permissions, device features, etc. I'm not sure what you mean by base security review...we have extensive internal reviews as well as external third party assessments of both hardware and software. I don't work in marketing or sales so I'm not clear on how the review findings are shared.  Silent Phone and Silent Text offer a privacy conscious communications. The underlying protocols are actually open (eg Zrtp) and where legally possible we have source in our public repos. The apps are included in the BP purchase or you can install on iOS / Android.  I can't tell you to buy it. I used a bp1 that was good but a bit underpowered for my usage patterns. I have a bp2 prototype that I personally love and use in place of my myriad of current gen handsets.  If you're curious, just call sales and arrange to demo the product. Try it for yourself.

Instead of trying to use NeXpose to do the reporting and documentation, you need something that can take that data from the scans and move it, based on various policies, to a much more digestible format. Look into various Risk Management vendors and solutions, it will allow certain assets to be assigned to various responsible and involved parties, etc.   Aside from that, have you thought about using NeXpose dynamic asset groups to assign systems for teams? Like if you have a particular couple guys that work on Linux RHEL systems, have all those systems in a RHEL dynamic asset group or a LINUX TEAM group or something similar. 1, 2, 3, if those are supposed to be priorities or something, then you are using dynamic asset groups in a sort of convoluted way.   You can always assign systems to groups like, ""Dave, Steve, Tom"" if they are the particular engineer to mitigate the issue if that is how you would rather do it, then you could make granular profiles to assign people to and give them limited access in NeXpose.

Just talk with the vendor before purchasing and I am sure they will let you know if for some reason it doesn't import from multiple sources. From there you would want to assign an IP range to a given person or team. You can also generally give things a 'risk' score in the risk management consoles. For instance, you can give a certain asset or range of IPs a certain 'risk' because of their importance, IE production or customer facing systems or a low risk system, like your internal NTP server or whatever. Then, coupled with the risk given by the scanning engines it will do some formula that you specify and it will determine your overall risk score for that given vulnerability on that device. From there you can assign deadlines based on the risk score.   I've used this before, http://modulo.com/enterprise-risk-management/. I personally think it's a POS though, it gets the job done and helps for better organization but there are much better products, but I believe the price point on this one is far from expensive."

In theory, if you dump your open network connections (open up command prompt, netstat -an) and then make a video call to the person, and dump them again during the call, you MIGHT be able to figure out their destination.  That's a pretty strong might, however, as Microsoft tends to be inserted into the middle of things.  As for engaging law enforcement, you'd better have a very sympathetic cop.   The first question they'll ask is, ""how did they get the pictures?"" Only if the person violated the law in your district will you have any chance.  From there, you'd need to get someone like a district attorney involved, who was willing to go after the person.  Then a judge would need to sign a subpoena to release the ISP records and identify the individual.

IT security expert Steve Gibson explains this concept here: https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm  However, it should be noted that only long, complex and truly randomly generated passwords offer maximum protection against attacks."
AskNetsec,3b0sp1,iAsjAWl1ZfCVf-l,2,Thu Jun 25 07:04:39 2015 UTC,"First - good question, you've done some research, and you're on the right track.  Now the bad part: you haven't stated a threat model.  Secure against what?  Typically, how a password is stored is more important than how strong the password is. So, if your users are part of a Windows domain, you're kinda screwed to begin with due to lack of salts, and the fact that Windows helpfully saves every password used on the box in the registry.  However, let's skip all that, and try to answer your question anyway , making assumptions as follows: 1.) You are using a Windows domain 2..) There are at least 100 accounts in the domain 3.) An attacker has compromised a machine in the domain using malware, and grabbed all the hashes from the registry.  Under these circumstances, it's unlikely the attacker would bother doing a brute force attack on any single password, because they don't need to. They will instead first run a rainbow table to get any really bad passwords; then they will apply heuristics. An example of an easy heuristic is: a dictionary word, 3 digits, then another dictionary word. If the attacker's choice of heuristics match your password scheme, it's game over in a few minutes or less. To be secure against this threat model, you need a password scheme that can't be translated to an easy heuristic. The only way to do this is randomness... however, the entire password doesn't need to be random. Take your example: dictionary word, 3 digits, another dictionary word. That's too simple, but we can fix it like this: Three dictionary words; two numeric separators; a wildcard, and one capitol letter. Make the separators a random number 0-1000.  Now add the wildcard: a symbol, randomly chosen, and placed somewhere other than first or last. Finally, capitalize any letter other than the first. Now, it becomes very hard to write a heuristic; I don't know where the symbol is, so I have to try adding it to each possible location. I also have to try upper and lower case; this effectively kills my dictionary attack.  Edit - just to clarify - the position of the wildcard must be randomly chosen to make this scheme work. If you always place it at the start of the second word, for example, then you're just hoping the attacker doesn't try that heuristic."

Security is always a compromise between usability and security.  There are all kinds of thoughtful workarounds like pass phrases. User, you password is ""Seriously, I like to eat 47 donuts everyday!"".  In the grand scheme of things, if I capture your password, I will likely crack it. For under $4k you can build a rig with 8 graphics cards that can check 8,000 NetNTLMv2 hashes per second.  It will run through all possible 8 character Windows passwords in something like 7 hours."
AskNetsec,3b0sp1,mustangsal,2,Thu Jun 25 01:53:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed, however with each additional character, your crack time goes up exponentially.  According to https://howsecureismypassword.net/, the password ""qk5QLlu0N%GF"" is 12 characters long, and at 4 billion guesses per second, it would take 344 thousand years. Lop off the last four characters, and we're down to an 8 character password that would take a typical desktop pc about 15 hours to crack at the same guess rate.  The same website rates ""Interest694Food"" which is 15 characters long without any punctuation as taking 6 billion years. Seems to me we're back to the point of ""a longer password is generally more secure"" assuming the attacker knows nothing about the password or the strategy used to create it.  Let's consider something else though. Assuming an attacker knows that the password generation strategy we use is 2 English words separated by a 3 digit number, and both of the words have a capitalized first letter. Assuming the attacker uses a wordlist of 20,000 words, wouldn't the possibilities be 20,000 * 19,999 * 1,000? That gives us just under 400 billion combinations (specifically 3.9998 × 1011). In an offline cracking scenario with 8,000 guesses per second, I suppose that's about 1.5 years assuming my math is correct.  Is this secure enough for someone's domain/email password?"

Your estimates of computing power are way off. A single entry level GPU will do 9 billion NTLM hashes per second so your 1.5 years is actually about 44 seconds. If you are using SHA256 instead, then it blows out to a whole 6 minutes.  You can build a machine with 4 or 5 good graphics cards and break the passwords in less time than it would take you to type them.  If you need to protect against an offline attack, I wouldn't use anything less than 16 random characters or 6 random words.  EDIT:   The same website rates ""Interest694Food"" which is 15 characters long without any punctuation as taking 6 billion years.

Whenever you log in, you have to remember to run 'export PATH=/var/log/apache\ :$PATH' in order to stick the real binaries at the front of your path so you can work.  Other ways of security through obscurity: run a trapped sshd on port 22 that runs shutdown upon someone logging into it via port 22.  To ACTUALLY login, run the real sshd on 445 or something else that looks non-suspicious to have open.  You could always run the web server in a chroot or container and have processes outside the container monitoring what's going on inside.  One of the coolest things I've heard about recently was some guys that put a custom firmware on their hard drive such that they could trigger an action if certain drive read patterns were carried out on the drive, to return different data.  Their use case was actually where a malware hack could embed itself in the drives' firmware, and then hide its payload on storage blocks that were reported to the OS as unusable.  You had to send a correctly signed system call to the drive firmware to unlock the payload.  It was awesome sounding stuff, but way out of my league.

One of the people I spoke to was in a typical SOC/analyst role and felt that they just weren't being challenged enough. Their boss was insistent that they shouldn't be trained because they might develop skills that would lead them to leave. The other was in a role where they had a solid job but it was soul destroying - constant meetings to get things done, an environment crippled by change management processes that were inherently resistent to change.  We talked about how they felt. That whole cog in a machine feeling you're getting is very common. Ultimately you need to identify the difference between what you want to do and the environment in which you want to work. The reason for this is that knowing those two things will help you identify where you want to work.  If you love tech but hate bureaucracy then doing a cool job at a military contractor will still make you feel bad. If you're more concerned about the bureaucracy than the tech, then maybe you should look to change your working environment rather than your role."

The short answer is that it means very little for encryption. AFAIK, all factoring ""programs"" which can run on the D-Wave chip require exponential time. Further, there are a few major issues currently:   The 512 qubit chip was way too small to even perform normal-sized problems, much less big ones, and the 512 qubit chip has major problems with noise and precision.   Many programming techniques for the D-Wave involve creating chains of qubits, so that they act as a single logical qubit. However, noise and precision issues often cause these chains to be broken, which basically results in a bad run with an incorrect solution to the problem. The more chains you have, the more likely a chain will break; the bigger the problem, the more chains you'll have.  It's possible that the new chip is better in these respects, but don't expect a push to post-quantum crypto for awhile.  EDIT: Of course, I forgot to mention. The D-Wave can't run Shor's algorithm, due to its implementation."

Shor's algorithm, which is what's being implemented on quantum computers for this purpose, effectively halves the bit length for symmetric key encryption, so a 256-bit key works like a 128-bit key - and in order to get this benefit, you have to deal with all the complexities of decoherence, which make the quantum computer more expensive than a classical computer that can solve the problem in the same amount of time. The only real issue is with public key encryption, which is particularly vulnerable to Shor's. However, it seems likely that someone will come up with a way to strengthen key exchange in a way that is resistant to this attack. And if you really need security, you can always avoid using RSA, such as by using certificates at both ends. (I realize this is impractical for general web-surfing.)"

It's out of your control if your servers' certificate is resigned at presentation to the user unless your site is whitelisted/excluded from Websense policy, which there's no reason to do if your site has a valid SSL cert from a trusted CA. There really isn't any need for concern on your end.  Websense isn't really a dodgy or disreputable company in these manners. Probably one of if not the biggest name in web filtering, including SSL deep packet inspection. They've been around for years and I always find it amusing when people discover they're being filtered and their traffic inspected and the subsequent outrage over it, even over SSL.  Speaking from my personal view, I don't give a shit what sites users go to. However, I'm under the thumb of regulatory agencies, Gaming Control Board and PCI-DSS, that network security is a much bigger deal than msot other places. Dealing with them and fines associated with them is much more of a hassle than filtering users' traffic. No ethical or moral dilemma for me.  We have a pretty tight Websense setup based around AD groups and it's not actively monitored thanks to thresholds and e-mail alerts for all the various categories and protocols it filters. The only time we have to run reports is when we're being hassled by some supervisor who thinks their graveyard employees are spending too much time on Facebook (they are) or a request from my boss. The transparent proxy mode (MitM, effectively) in Websense is a godsend from an admin perspective as opposed to pushing out a policy or agent to config client PCs to go through the proxy normally.  If the Websense box is compromised there are far bigger worries than Websense being compromised."

If you are like me, and you don't qualify or quantify things that you 'perceive' , then what is the motivation? If i were working for a home security place i would work there happily because i enjoy the technical aspects of implementing high-end door locks, window kits, alarm systems, etc. etc. But i don't intrinsically give a flying squirrels ballz weather the actual ultimate 'security' is achieved. In fact , it cannot be achieved. The best response to a security incident can never be preemptively proven. Although excellent response to security issues is all one can hope to do. The defense of security issues is also thankless because no one appreciates soft threats like what an actual cyber attack looks like. So what is a InfoSec Pro left to do?"

The standards, policies, sensors and systems you put in place will most likely see all kinds of operational problems in your organization.  Kindly bring up the operational issues you see with upper management and fix the issues.  Upper management will see benefits to security outside of the traditional method (which is attempting to scare people half to death).  Once you gain upper management's trust it doesn't matter what the lackeys below you think of your security... then you can proceed with putting your tyrannical system of total control in place within your organization and then your security is complete as you transition from fixing operational issues to fixing security issues.  Upper management will realize training is lacking and slowly begin training staff or re-staffing removing another hurdle to good security in the user.  Use industry metrics such as SANs Top 20 critical controls and Australian DOD top 35 mitigations.  Always weigh business processes changes with security controls because if you damage your ability to make money it doesn't matter how insecure or secure you are... if you don't exist it doesn't matter.  I've seen a lot of security pros and consultants try to scare upper management into instituting security and controls and I think this is the wrong way to go about getting the job done.  Good security across the board will create a well organized environment that has best practices implemented and this will ALWAYS effect the bottom line in a beneficial way and this will make C levels very happy."

(If the latter, then you must have a huge corporate LAN if Google Maps is part of the rogue AP detection). Basic radio-direction-finding of Access Points is fairly simple since they typically have a maximum effective range of <500 feet.  Devices like the FLuke, or any of the many site-survey applications on a laptop with a directional antenna, or other dedicated devices can do that job easily. If you're talking about geolocating an AP, like any AP globally then that is more complicated since it's typically a LAN device, and thus things get infinitely more difficult in terms of tracking these things over the Internet, and then your geolocation really boils down to the location of the public IP of the user who happens to be using WLAN.

If they respond by sending a note from their lawyer or threatening you, you're kinda SOL.   If they don't respond in a few weeks time, you have a few options:   Do nothing. This is the course of least liability Notify major clients of the company that there is a problem without disclosing details and let them put a fire under the company's ass. Escalate the issue up the chain or to relevant governing bodies. If there's a compliance issue, for example, PCI DSS or HIPAA. US CERT or similar organizations might want to know if the site is relevant to their interests. Tell everyone. This is not smart, but will probably get the problem solved the fastest.

There's no real way for VPN providers to prove they won't log anything, because it still has to go through their network/servers. They can give you a tour and show you all the servers they own, then flip a switch and log everything after you leave.   All we really have to go on are the reputations of the company, the laws the provider must follow, and the free-market nature of this. Provider A wants you as a customer, and if they give up logs when they say they don't keep them... People won't trust them, and their reputation gets worse.

While you're right, @shadybusin3ss, in saying that it's incredibly difficult to prove to customers that you don't keep logs, I think reputation stands for a lot and if a company is willing to give you names, details and engage in open conversation, they are willing to be accountable.

I wouldn't."

AskNetsec,3aju2x,IWillNotBeBroken,5,Sun Jun 21 00:14:58 2015 UTC,"You're right.  Look at your bill or ask for the private key.  Ask about their IPSec deployment.  It doesn't make sense for a carrier to encrypt an IPVPN.   Let's talk about number 3.  I am a provider.  I offer internet in the form of a default route or full table at commodity rates.  It's pretty cheap.  I offer a value add in the form of an IPVPN.  It's not commodity, the table is limited to whatever you advertise to us.  It's a service I can bill you for.  Now, to top off both of those services, I can stick some managed IP gear out there, like a Cisco ISR or an SRX or something.  The ISR can be used to perform class of service functions, or more enterprise routing things, like EIGRP.  Or it can be used to provide an IPSec tunnel between two internet connected sites.  So this last part is kind of important.  You're the customer.  Think about your costs.  Why would you buy an IPVPN when you could just buy internet from the same provider for cheaper, then IPSec between those sites and get exactly the same results?"
AskNetsec,3aju2x,jiannone,2,Sun Jun 21 03:13:20 2015 UTC,"Why would you buy an IPVPN when you could just buy internet from the same provider for cheaper, then IPSec between those sites and get exactly the same results?   Well, they're not exactly the same -- especially if all your sites' uplinks are not with the same provider.  MPLS VPNs are just a newer way to deliver point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connectivity (just like good old TDM technologies did).  At least for us, one big differentiator is that we honor QoS across the network (and partner networks) for the MPLS VPN services.  Large businesses especially seem to love keeping their own (remember, point-to-point) low-priority traffic from interfering with their high-priority traffic (voice, usually)."
AskNetsec,3aju2x,IWillNotBeBroken,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:41:19 2015 UTC,"I can see how this is confusing.  You've inserted two orthogonal points.  First, you talk about different providers.  I make an assertion that if you can get an IPVPN from a provider at two or more locations, you can get an internet service from the same provider.  I also assert that you're over paying if you encrypt an IPVPN service, because you lose almost all the benefits of that IPVPN service by encrypting transit traffic.  COS is a really good example of that lost benefit.  Second, you talk about quality of service.  Unless you're particularly savvy and your vendors are particularly supportive, I doubt you're getting QOS with IPSec protected traffic.  You'd have to implement a specific combination of IPSec mechanisms and COS functions in your gear to get the traffic marked the way you wanted.  You'd probably want ESP Transport mode, so your original IP header stayed intact, which means you abandon a lot of the higher level security functions provided by your expensive firewall.  Your QOS mark policy has to occur pretty deeply within your network, at least one hop before the IPSec edge.  So you have to know what you're doing there too.  In my experience, that's an unreasonable request from the enterprise IT folks."

VPN's don't prevent those with access to your local network from seeing a that a connection exists, but they do prevent them from seeing what data that connection is sending/receiving. The encryption fully anonymizes your datastream, and is impossible to crack without the decryption key, which is solely hosted on our VPN gateway itself, and thus is not accessible by any other outside agency.The most they would see is that you're connecting to a remote IP, but nothing beyond that, nor would they know what is being sent/received. As such, so long as the VPN is operating, then your connection and all traffic between you and our servers should be fully anonymized and protected.

You have to understand that they are often times catering to people that don't even have internet access.  It could be that one bank did this and then the rest followed, then whenever someone in the banking industry seeks to do customer authentication this is the 'best' scenario that they can find given their systems on the backend and a slue of other possibilities honestly."
AskNetsec,3afzrr,ldpreload,2,Fri Jun 19 21:42:14 2015 UTC,"Probably the threat model they have in mind is a keylogger on the client device. If I type the entire password, someone with a keylogger can replay it. If I only type a few letters, and next time I'm asked for a few different letters, the keylogger doesn't help.  If I worked at infosec in a bank, I could see myself believing that my servers' security is great and my customers' security probably isn't, and so it's okay to trade off a riskier approach on the server side (password hashing only matters if the servers get broken into) for a safer approach on the client. I'd probably be wrong, but I can see the chain of thought there.  One other reason I'd be wrong is there are better solutions for defeating keyloggers, like two-factor authentication, that are compatible with good security practice on the server side."

Yes, they do have a chapter or two on the fundamentals you need to know.  However, their pricing model is based upon week/month/etc.  So if it will be very expensive if you pay to learn fundamentals over 2-3 months at an OSCP Price, it would be like buying a plane ticket for a 60 mile trip.   If you are the type of person who needs a curriculum, I would recommend eLearnSecurity Pentesting Student (PTS).  I haven't taken that course due to already having OSCP when I found out about ELS but have taken their wAPT and wAPT-X course.

If I were you I would work on some more entry level certifications (CEH and CCNENT come to mind). These won't make you ready for OCSP but they will expose you to knowledge that OCSP will demand from you. I would also read books and blogs about cyber security, make a virtual lab, or signup for one, and really learn as much as you can and try, in a safe and legal way, what you learn.  OSCP is huge and demanding. If you don't believe me search for reviews and you will find people have have years of experience struggling and talking about how hard it is.

For example, if you are pulling down 20-30GB per month all by yourself, they are going to wonder what the hell you are doing.  If they get hit with a DMCA takedown, they are going to take a look.  If you are just browsing porn and the communist manifesto, no one is going to give a shit. Either way you slice it, your traffic will be tied to your system.  If you use the PEAP MSCHAPv2 system, they will have your username tied to all of your traffic.  If you use the MAC address, they probably already have a database join setup which will tie your username to your traffic.  Neither option is going to gain you anything in that regard.     Everyone here normally connects through the PEAP, so I'm wondering if I might not be so large on their radar via the mac way.   Quite the opposite probably.  If you are trying to blend into a crowd, don't stand out from the crowd.  If everyone normally uses PEAP, being ""that guy"" who insists on the other method is gonna get you flagged (assuming they care)."

That may mean that in your attempt to keep your browsing private, you are imperiling your education.  That does not strike me as a good plan; but, that's your call.  If you are actually spoofing a MAC address (I assume you know that the first several bytes identify the type of network device) then the only thing to be wary of is either port blocking turned on for that device class; or, if they are doing heuristic traffic analysis and your device pops up as abnormal (this is probably not likely).     Is 20-30GB a month really that much anymore these days though?   Honestly, I just pulled those numbers out of somewhere without sunlight.  I've not had to set network rules in a rather long time.

I realize that MAC addresses identify the type of network device, but I typed in a random mac and it was approved about an hour later.  I doubt they will actually realize that that mac couldn't have possibly come from a PS4, as according to the network the mac is already approved.

AskNetsec,3a6x6o,Telnet_Rules,2,Wed Jun 17 20:18:08 2015 UTC,"I'm extremely surprised they actually care about VPN traffic, specifically SSL based VPN traffic. Are you saying they don't allow VPNs outbound at all?  Either way though, from a network monitoring perspective, either method of connection you mentioned above will most likely still be monitored. And they will still be able to tie you to what you do historically, though the amount of data retention on what you do varies based on their tools.  When I say they know what you do, I mean they have from/to IP addresses, the tie in to you as a user, what port you were connecting to, the time it happened, and the amount of traffic sent to/from that connection. Deep packet inspection only means they can see those things even if you obscure the traffic based on a different port, like bittorrent over a common low port for example. It also may do some analysis on the type of traffic to make a guess at the application used, like email, ssh, bittorrent, rdp, or any number of things you might do.  There is no magic here to get around that monitoring. If you do enough traffic to a single source, you'll stand out. If your traffic patterns vary in time or destination or are lower speed, you'll stand out less.   Note that the monitoring also highlights things over time. As an example I get a report of top talkers, senders, destinations, conversations, and the like once per week. If you were spreading out your usage but still doing it throughout the day, you would show up on that weekly report since your traffic would still total a large amount, just spread out over time."

AskNetsec,3a5kn4,jamie-mc,4,Wed Jun 17 12:05:52 2015 UTC,"Is a Vuln Assessment and/or a Pentest even appropriate given that there are no servers?   Yes, absolutely.  Many attacks do not start at the servers.  They will target the weakest link they can find to get a foothold in the target network.  For example, consider the breach of the Target network.  The attackers started by breaching a company monitoring store HVAC systems.  From there they used poorly secured credentials to pivot into the Target network. Since your customer is going to have remote access to the client network, the client needs some assurance that your company isn't leaving the credentials laying about and isn't going to be hosting an attacker.     Should the reports include a SOC3 from Google or something, since Google Drive for Work is used to store the in-scope client data?   In the final report, you may want to include some information on how you intend to secure your client's data while utilizing cloud services.  Any agreements you have with Google pertaining to security, data-at-rest, and disaster recovery will probably need to be included.  However, this is probably stipulated by the contract from the client.   Should I scan the Mac clients for security holes?   If you think Macs are immune to security vulnerabilities, please find someone to beat you about the head and shoulders until you come to your senses.1  Yes, scan the Macs, they are an attack surface.   Or can we somehow get away with reports that merely assess the external firewall/router?   If you build a 10 foot high wall, the attackers will show up with an 11 foot ladder.  Do not think of your network as a fortress with barbarians milling about outside banging on the firewalls trying to get in.  Chances are that the attack will start with one of your users making a mistake.  They will click on a link, respond to a phishing attempt, or just get unlucky and browse to a website which has been hacked and is serving malware.2  In short, the attackers will make it past your firewall.  If that is the last line of defense on your network, you're fucked.  You should be looking at everything from the ground up.  Are your client machines configured in a secure way?  Do they have host based firewalls and intrusion detection?  Do you have network based intrusion detection?  Do you have application whitelists (e.g. Applocker) defined on your workstations to prevent malcious code from running?  Is all software on all machines up to date?  Do you have good backups for when someone fires up a copy of CryptoLocker?  Do you have filesystem and security auditing enabled on your systems?  How are those logs reviewed?  Do you receive automatic alerts when suspicious activity shows up on a host or the network?  In short, you need to expect that the attackers will make it into your network and design your systems to mitigate the damage they can accomplish once that happens."

AskNetsec,3a5kn4,_o7,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:55:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry -- I hear you, but in these circumstances, I must disagree.  I'm not sure that the lack of hiring a security expert as their 4th employee implies that they are providing shit services.  The company does not provide security services.  Just data crunching in this case.  So the next hires will probably be more resources who provide the directly billable services -- or sales people to sell the same.  IMHO, the right move at this juncture.  Obviously, no startup (that wants to ever make money) would run away from a very large client requesting services that the startup CAN provide, just because the large client wants a rigorous IT Security Survey to be completed.  In this particular case, this startup just happens to have a very large client who have a STANDARD IT survey of 1000+ questions and about 6 major docs that are required.  It is a shotgun approach that they apply to ALL providers, regardless of whether   The initial assessment performed by an in-house generalist is just the first step.  There are plans -- later -- to hire an independent third party security expert to do more stringent analysis, as required.  But, with the short due date for this IT survey, there has not been enough time to do both in-house and third party.  So -- turning away from the snap judgements -- and back to the actual question... Is a Vuln Assessment and/or a Pentest even appropriate given that there are no servers? Should the reports include a SOC3 from Google? Should I scan the Mac clients for security holes?  Thanks again for any help pointing me in the right direction on this."

AskNetsec,3a3ens,dynamicfusion,10,Tue Jun 16 22:32:30 2015 UTC,"/u/ComputersAreDumb gave a very incomplete and confusing answer. You should ignore it.  Yes, by default your home router essentially acts as a de facto firewall due to NAT. It does not pass any inbound traffic to anything on your local network unless you explicitly forward a port, or set it to DMZ mode (which for a consumer router essentially means ""forward all ports"", so equivalent to disabling a firewall). In the default configuration, no one will be able to access hosts on your local network simply by sending traffic to your external NAT IP. The router itself is unlikely to be vulnerable to remote exploits (keyword remote) itself; just make sure remote management is disabled. You can port scan it from another host, 1-65535 TCP and UDP, to confirm there is no vulnerability surface.  The router still very well may be, and in fact very likely is, vulnerable to client-side attacks like XSS and CSRF, and its web panel and firmware is likely vulnerable to various issues that will allow code execution and privilege escalation.  Your definition of ""unhackable"" is very vague. No, you are definitely not unhackable. You simply (probably) aren't exposing listening services on your devices to the Internet; that's it. There are many, many other ways to exploit the router and the devices behind that router."
AskNetsec,3a3ens,catcradle5,2,Wed Jun 17 00:07:57 2015 UTC,"I second this. /r/ComputersAreDumb is on the right... track. He seems to be trying a scaring tactic, claiming that your router's default security is a joke. That's not necessarily the case.  Your router has 65535 TCP and UDP ports. If any ports are opened or not filtered correctly, they may be potential attack vectors for someone on the Web. People may run port scans (using nMap, Nessus, an online service, etc...) on your router to check for open ports. An open port may allow two-way communication between your modem and an external host (someone else's computer), which would potentially compromise your network's security.  As for phishing, malware, and RATs, these is all client-side attacks. Someone could compromise one of your hosts (computer, tablet, phone) and thus open router/firewall ports from within your network. These are not direct attacks on your router."

A Hypothetical: I have this ASUS router, and say a windows server behind it as a fileserver. If this server is only for LAN use and has no services forwarded to the outside, can I have a reasonable expectation that if any arbitrary hacker were to know my IP address of the router, they would not be able to uncloak any devices running behind the router? From my nubish point of view, it seems I am completely anonymous and protected as far as the WAN -> LAN interface is concerned. If you can't peak into a LAN to attack a device through the router from WAN, then the only option left is to somehow gain access internally through physical or malware (user-stupidity) means. Am I right?"

I am more curious about the external WAN attacks trying to get into the LAN.   Sort of. The thing is, with XSS and CSRF, all you have to do is visit a web page containing a few lines of Javascript, and suddenly someone has full access to your router. They can change the DNS servers, replace the firmware with something malicious, actively MitM you, etc.  You share a LAN with your router, your browser can access the router, so XSS/CSRF -> router access from the point of view of your computer/device.   Ways to protect yourself from that:   Use NoScript everywhere, only whitelist sites you fully trust. Upgrade your router firmware if you learn that a vulnerability in it has been uncovered. Use a non-default username and a strong password on the router. If you don't have an active session with the router, then a browser-sourced exploit will either have to try and bruteforce the credentials (which is quite common), or find an authentication bypass to the router, which unfortunately is also pretty prevalent.   And of course, all of this is on top of the usual risks of typical client-side exploits and malware.  Check this article out:   http://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2015/05/an-exploit-kit-dedicated-to-csrf.html  https://threatpost.com/exploit-kit-using-csrf-to-redirect-soho-router-dns-settings/112993   can I have a reasonable expectation that if any arbitrary hacker were to know my IP address of the router, they would not be able to uncloak any devices running behind the router? From my nubish point of view, it seems I am completely anonymous and protected as far as the WAN -> LAN interface is concerned.   To an extent. They won't be able to learn anything about your internal network, in the default configuration of most modern consumer router, just from having your IP. However, things change quite a bit if you visit a malicious web page. They can get the LAN IP of your computer (research WebRTC), cause you to effectively probe the rest of your network, and in some cases port scan or exploit other devices on the LAN."

AskNetsec,3a3ens,Sol_Sanctum,0,Tue Jun 16 23:11:41 2015 UTC,"Routers aren't designed to do large Access Control List (ACL)'s.  Every time a packet comes in, it needs to run against all the rules.  As you can imagine when you have a lot of rules, it can slow down the routing (which you want to be fast).  Additionally, Routers are Stateless while Firewalls are Stateful, which just means firewalls monitor the TCP Session from start to finish. While Routers associate every packet as a different one.  In the end.  As long as you don't have any ports open (port forwarding/NAT/DMZ/remote admin/etc configured).   Someone won't be able to hack you with just your IP Address.  That doesn't mean they you won't be immune to being hacked if they attacker gets you to execute code.  For example there was a Russian TOR Exit Node recently, which was placing detecting when the person was downloading an EXE.

What I did notice though is that the following check does list ciphers:  NVT: Check for SSL Weak Ciphers (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.103440)   It was in all my reports that also triggered the ""SSLv3 Protocol"" alert (Protocol and Ciphers are 2 different things), so you could check if that one is in your scan results with a list of ciphers you would want to deactivate. The only other way I could imaging the ""SSLv3 Protocol"" alert being triggered is by a ""secure"" cipher that is being offered via SSLv3 (not sure if that is possible, I tend to just deactivate the SSL protocol altogether and only offer TLS). But I'd assume that Qualys would have found and pointed out anything running on SSLv3.  Other useful resources for checking / setting up SSL/TLS:  nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 <ip>   or with     https://github.com/jvehent/cipherscan  Settings suggestions: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS"

With a non-interactive shell, such as the type you sometimes get with certain exploits, you are basically entering commands blindly without getting any direct feedback about what it did.

For example, if you have a php webshell  <?php     system($_GET['cmd']); ?>   you are able to execute commands on the server and you will see the output, but the shell is still not interactive.  An interactive shell is a shell where you can modify and influence the state between command calls. Simple example: if you run bash on your system and run ""cd /tmp"", the shell will change the working directory to /tmp and stay there. If you were to do the same with the webshell above, it would also change to /tmp, but your next call to your shell would not know about the change.  Another example: Imagine you have a simple python program:  n = raw_input('What is your name? ') print 'Hello ' + n   If you run this program in your local terminal, you can interact with the program, meaning you can ""reply"" to the question. If you call this program using the webshell above, you can't enter your reply, because the webshell is non-interactive."

AskNetsec,39wql0,_o7,4,Mon Jun 15 22:17:40 2015 UTC,"Hey, Nylithic. The CEH is all over the place with what it wants to talk about and how to talk about it. Extremely disorganized course material. The all-in-one book will teach you more about ethical hacking than the real EC-Council books, to an extent. But the reason you get the CEH is to simply have it on your resume. It is a stepping stone... that's all it is. If you hear someone bragging about being a CEH... they're young and ignorant or just stupid. I enjoyed my experience because I did a camp... but the process to get to the camp and get my cert afterwards were insane. I will never take an EC-Council certification again or re-certify. EC-Council is ridiculously hard to deal with.   As a late teen, I am still working on my Associates, so I have very little IT experience overall. I landed a Security Analyst job last week BECAUSE of my CEH. It started the conversation with this company. Keep in mind, I am in the middle of PWK/OSCP but I haven't finished or certified for that yet. CEH is and shouldn't be anything but a stepping stone. It is a subtle joke among security professionals... but a lot of them still have it.   Edit: And to answer your question /u/TheOriginalRK, I agree with /u/NetSecPentester. Since you're in school, I would definitely try and go CEH. If you want to get into the pentesting world... that will help you with getting a job out of school. Camps aren't cheap though, and you can't get the cert without going to a camp unless you have 2 years of experience or something. You can speak with EC-Council directly about ignoring that though. OSCP is great but a lot of information. Make sure you're able to move around Linux decently and I would play with Kali a decent amount beforehand. Having your CEH will really help with getting a job as an Analyst but not teach you a ton. The OSCP will teach you a lot and possibly get you a job as a Jr Pen Tester. Go to security conferences, go to CTFs, read as many books from Amazon as you can, and keep up to date with exploits. (Twitter is great for this)  Your Bachelors/Masters will help you a lot with getting a job if you have the skills to back it up from these certs/self-study.  Forensics is not my cup of tea as a career but CHFI (another EC-Council cert) is a forensics certification. You can also look into GIAC certs for forensics, I haven't done a ton of research about which certs are better than others... but you are free to do so. :P http://www.giac.org/certifications/forensics From what I've heard about getting into forensics as a career... it is boring. Please take my words with a grain of salt... but it just sounds like a non appealing career to me. You aren't finding nuclear launch codes from hard drives most of the time. It pays REALLY well but meh. So does pen testing. I use forensic methods when pen testing a fair amount. If someone here has more knowledge about forensics, please jump in and call me out."

There aren't that many books for pen testing overall. You have to find books about specific topics.   I am a big social engineering buff, so I have a lot of books that you could read in that department, but social engineering isn't necessarily something you want to spend your time on right now. It's not very hard to implement if a company wants it as a part of the test. (Which isn't very common because it works 125% of the time) I am big on psychology and... ethical... manipulation.   Courses by Offensive Security are amazing. It's hands on and they really push their students to 'try harder' when stuck on something. I recommend doing OSCP/PWK when you feel like you're ready. There is plenty of information in this subreddit about that.   I don't know where your technical education is at so I can't really offer perfect advice on what you should do, but most of the time you start off as an Analyst or some kind of help desk position. So you have time. A VERY simple/standard road map for certs could be... Network+ > Security+ > C|EH > OSCP ... A lot of people do OSCP after working for a while.  You can also look into doing Cisco certs. CCENT isn't too difficult to get and looked at nicely. Grab a Microsoft cert somewhere. MCSA: whatever. Offensive Security offers another intermediate course, the OSWP but that would be something I recommend taking after OSCP. Also, look into GIAC. They have the most expensive certifications typically because you go through SANS camps/courses to learn, but most/all companies love GIAC.  I've given you quite a bit of general information.

Honeslty, college isn't necessary either, get the CCNA and start working in IT then after a few years move into security. I know most of the people coming out of high school in the last 20 years have been told go to college its the only way and that's true for many profession but not IT, it is extremely rare to find a college degree valued higher than experience in IT. I speak from experience I am still in my 20's and in my organization the next step in my career is management (CISO) I already make more than double a few friends who are also in IT security and got degrees first."
AskNetsec,39zeue,netsecwarrior,3,Tue Jun 16 00:57:30 2015 UTC,"Just about any bug defined purely in terms of business rules is a logic flaw. I don't think there's any real way of classifying these, and they don't gather much attention because a ""logic flaw"" in some systems might be desirable behavior in others. I can see a $-100 transaction making sense in a system that allows the transfer of debt as well as credit. Or just plain borrowing. A management program for communal resources might allow ""purchasing"" negative quantities of some product.  Computer security therefore focuses on things that are unambiguously technical flaws. Whatever you are trying to accomplish, there should be no reason your system is vulnerable to SQL injection, or susceptible to being a Confused Deputy, or uses a memory buffer after freeing it, etc etc."

Sure someone may download a shitty spyware toolbar but those are largely adware and not focused on giving a focused attacker remote access to the network via a RAT.  It's much more important that you focus on patching the various 3rd party apps automatically that you find in your software portfolio, and hardening your Windows security settings.

Normally takes quite a bit of ""paying your dues"" before you go into it. So this is a longterm goal, virtually nobody becomes a pen tester right out of college. Those that do make very little money for a while.  Developer: Easier to get a job after college, but money is going to depend on your area, coding language, and skill. I know some devs who make ~$50k I know others who pull in ~$100k. I don't know the particulars on that.  Security engineer: Same story, different chapter. Skill/area/industry/experience/company all are going to play a part in your salary. I was offered jobs as a security analyst making $35k, I have friends who make close to ~$100k being security engineers. To me, it's to much compliance, check box, spread sheet work, and not enough hands on.   I am a Jr. level Pen Tester right now, I like the mental challenge that it provides, and the salary is ok (nothing to write home about). After a few years, Im sure the money will come in, right now Im focused on proving my worth and sharpening my skills more than anything.  This was my progression: Associates in Programming > Bachelors in Information Security > Internship for Sys Admin > Job as Sys Admin > OSCP cert > SSCP cert > Jr Pen tester.

We conduct internal pentesting, manage vulnerabilities and remediations, design security testing for new systems and processes, implementing new security controls and devices, etc. Basically a security engineer is a SOC analyst, pentester, and much more all rolled into one roll. It might be different in some organizations. Most of the compliance reporting, spreadsheets, check box work is ISO/CISO (management).

But from my experience in USA and parts of Europe it's not illegal to run pentests as long as you have permission from the organization being scanned. This is something you will probably need to look into yourself.  Most hosting providers have clauses in their ToS prohibiting stuff like hacking, scanning, DDoS from their servers; and have systems in place to monitor outgoing connections that look malicious. So expect to trip those and raise some red flags, may even automatically block the server for a short time. But in my experience a short email from the organisation to the hoster stating the nature of the scans, that they are intentional, and the scope (source, target, type of scan,...) clears things up. Here is the problem you will run into: some hosters may place you on a ""whitelist"" for your scans, some won't or can't. If the hoster won't or can't allow your scans unhindered (even though you aren't doing anything illegal or technically violating their ToS, even if it looks like you are), then it is time to move on to a different hoster.

AskNetsec,39pl3f,CloudGnome,3,Sat Jun 13 18:03:46 2015 UTC,Likely someone guessed the password you used on an account that has access to that info.  It doesn't matter much in the scheme of things. You use that number for hardware maintenance from Dell.   I'd just go change every password to every account to a new and unique value from a known clean machine.

AskNetsec,39lon5,timconradinc,4,Sat Jun 13 13:34:11 2015 UTC,"Here's what I'd do (and have done). Keep in mind that you're shooting for the stars here, you want to have things that may be just outside of what's actually possible.  Make a list of things you need your firewall to do today   Basic Rule Sets for allow/deny Blocking inbound malware, spyware Web Content Filtering VPN? site-to-site? Client-based? QoS? Whatever else.   Next, come up with a core list of things you think any firewall should do:   Web Based Interface Support IP v6 (yeah, yeah) Stateful Packet Capture on Firewall   Next, think about where you see not only your organization is going to be in 3-5 years (since you're stuck with your decision for that long), but also where tech is going to be in 3-5 years.   with bring your own device do you need captive portal functionality? What's the UI like? If it's old and creaky and cavernous, it's likely going to continue to be so Other things I can't think of right now.   Look at what you actually do on your firewalls today, and what your environment is like today and in the future. Are you doing many changes to the firewalls now? Could, in theory, an API assist in those changes? While I haven't glued the things together, I've got scripts that can create objects on the firewall, assign them profiles on the firewall, then add them to the load balancer, so basically a single script could handle end-to-end deployments.  In most organizations you need to be able to say why you picked something at some point. Look at the Gartner reports for products, not only they may list things you haven't heard of, they're generally accepted by PHB types as the authority on products.  The sad part about this is that much of it comes down to your presentation, elevator pitch, and argument skills. On a checklist, most things end up being 'yes' - 'will this car get you from point a to point b?' Yes. But, one is a Fred Flinstone car, and the other is a high end BMW. One gets the job done,  sort of, but the other is so much easier to use.  That being said, I have 4 palo alto clusters in prod and they're great. They have the luxury of having a modern UI design and a modern firewall design. They have a lot of features that makes doing things on them really easy. We use wildfire in front of our mail servers and it regularly catches things that our mail gateways don't catch for an hour or two. I use their QoS features to rate-limit all the cheap hosting providers so hosts can't easily send us thousands of messages per hour. The log searching abilities are to notch and I think the ad-hoc reporting is the best i've ever seen in a non-ad-hoc reporting tool.  However, I have issues with Palo Alto, as well. Their documentation tends to run the route of the 'how to draw an owl' image. At one point, their ssl intercept document was about 2 pages of how to import the root ca from AD, and a line of 'now import that into the firewall.' Their tech support has been pretty good when I've used them"

We were provided with several VMs that we had to network together by configuring networking on the clients as well as a firewall, router, and IDS (Snort) using a few guidelines like certain clients were allowed access to specific services on a server. Then we had to use a few preloaded tools on a ""hacker"" client to attack the server then add rules to the firewall and IDS to detect and block the attacks. The project consisted of 7 VMs - user (win7), corp(win7), pfsense(firewall), linux(router), linux(snort), server(win2k8), hacker(win7). One of the tools/attacks was LOIC to DoS the server.  For simplicity, if the focus is on securing, I'd recommend finding LOIC and running that. If you really want to make your own botnet, you can use this which was posted on /r/netsec the other day. The only real legal way to construct a botnet is if you own all the systems being used as well as your network so its easily doable if you have a powerful machine or two that can run multiple VMs in an isolated network. If you're not strong in networking, setting up a network in VMs is incredibly easy and everything you need is in google (I had no idea what I was doing with that project and was able to find everything I needed to know after a few hours of research) so you can get everything up and running with ease."

On modern OSs, however, allocation doesn't always guarantee it's really available.  First, the memory (or other memory) could be swapped out to disk to make more RAM available.

I'll likely move to Qubes in the next few months. 95% of the time I running on one of my Linux VMs. I use a Surface with Windows for stuff like Spotify, watching TV, and taking notes/making diagrams. I really only use Windows when running games. I try to avoid internet browsing on my work machines when running Windows.  Authentication is handled from a RaspberryPi instance that has no ssh access. Passwords and ssh keys are managed through a combination KeepassX and encrypted partitions. The key for the encrypted partitions are kept in Yubikeys that I keep on my car keys. Backup keys and hard copies of Passwords are kept in a safe. I sync the partition images weekly to keep my passwords up to date across devices. Use google chrome for browsing. Thunderbird for email. There are better apps out there, but I like being able to manage security updates through a package manager. Keeping up with all of the security issues by hand can be time consuming. I don't bother with PGP because I just avoid using email for anything important.  I don't really use my phone for any sensitive work, but I do use it to for 2 factor auth through Duo.  My main concern isn't the government spying on me. I'm mostly concerned with leaking information about clients, or someone else gaining access to one of my clients through one of my machines. So I don't worry about stuff like duckduckgo or google spying on me through chrome.  All of my servers run Debian or OpenBSD. Shorewall for firewall on the Linux boxes.

A lot of simple things to help keep things secure, unattended upgrades for security, key based auth, one service per vm, etc.  If Docker proves to be secure, I'll probably slowly start migrating everything to that.  I'll likely get tripwire setup on everything and push more authentication through my Kerberos system in the near future.  I don't use anything like Facebook or Google Plus (and I've try to scrub the internet of my private existence) as those are popular tools for potential attackers. I do have stuff about my professional life and my company on the web though. I generally use a different username on all of my accounts and they are mostly just gibberish words.  This might be a little overkill. Most of these systems I set up as preparation for implementing similar systems for clients.

AskNetsec,39gf4j,ForestC,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:08:31 2015 UTC,"1) Initially I had a set up like the one described here: http://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Secondary_GPU_Passthrough  Not knowing that this setup only works with ATI I bought an nVidia graphics card in February (because of better Linux support). This was going to take a lot of work to get working. Rather than waste the card I just decided to dual boot Xen and Windows. In order for me to play games, I have to shutdown all my VMs and reboot into Windows to play games. The work on QEMU vga passthrough is promising, but I don't want to mess around with it until its a little more stable.  Edit: I think the easiest way to create that balance is by having multiple computers and servers. I have a number of old low power computers doing various things all of the time, and they stay on constantly. Anything that needs to be on all the time is running on one of those machines. My desktop (which I use for gaming) only contains things that are ephemeral, that way if I decide to shut all the VMs down so I can play a game, nothing is lost.  2) I didn't really get rid of my online past as much as I just stopped adding to it. The first step was just to identify everywhere I had an online presence, and simply delete everything and never go back. This includes all email address, reddit accounts. Anything that you used in your previous life is deleted. Clear all of your cookies refresh your IP address. Next reopen all of the account but with fake names. Create an email address with a fake name, create a new reddit account with a new name, etc. Block cookies.  Eventually all of the data about you that remains on the cloud becomes so out of date that its useless. Also if your name is common and enough personal details about you change, you'll sort of fade into the background noise.  Its all about striking a balance between anonymity and personal control. If you can keep personal control over your data, its ok to have it on the Internet because you're not going to give it to anyone you don't want to have it, and you can remove it if necessary. If you have to use another service, like Reddit, remain anonymous. If your information cannot be linked back to you its useless.  For personal things (and things between family and friends), I usually just run my own personal versions. For example, instead of Dropbox I use Sparkleshare. When I want to show someone photos, I upload them to my ownCloud server and then delete them once I'm done with them. I run all of my own email servers. Basically I just run everything that I can. In the event that I don't want the information out there, I can remove it.  As for professional stuff, I have all kinds of info out there somewhere. One of the problems of having to sell yourself is that you have to be out there. I run my work website and there is a fair bit of personal info on that. I have a linked-in and a G+ account for my work. I'm really not that concerned with people knowing information about me (I'm not dumb enough to use birthdays or addresses for passwords). My biggest concern is that a irate employee or someone else I've managed to piss off will come after my personal accounts or my friends and family (who probably are using their b-day for a password) or getting fired from a job because I said something stupid on my Reddit account. By staying anonymous on the internet; you make it harder for people to identify where and who to attack."
