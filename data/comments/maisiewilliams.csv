maisiewilliams,321bop,scrumpy613,-18,Thu Apr 9 19:56:48 2015 UTC,"Eh, I would say my generation (Same age as Maisie) has kicked itself in the teeth.  I was born in Manchester, most of the people I went to school with, went to college, got places to do A-levels and after a few months dropped out and decided weed, getting pregnant and lot's of sex is a good decision. I don't blame the politicians, the resources are there for almost everybody to make something of themselves, it's just most don't want to earn it, they want to be given it...or they don't just know what they want at the age of 17. But anyway, this has been going on for decades; all youngsters are dumb and stupid. But, I think my life is better off since Cameron came to power, my particular town was rather depraved, but it got a government grant to develop it. Now a massive amount of homes are being built, people are getting jobs, my nieces and nephews who I grew up with have all either gone to college, got a job or got apprenticeships and a new town centre has been built.  I think Cameron gets harsher criticism than he deserves. He said a few weeks ago that he wouldn't stand for a 3rd term, he answered honestly, he could have dodged it by saying ""let's focus on this"" or ""I would let to get this done first"", but he answered it straight. What happened? The media and opposition slaughtered him for causing a ""leadership race among the ranks"", and then we wonder why politicians are not more frank. He also gave homosexuals more rights, which the apparent social democratic opposition failed to do. But, it seems to be the cliché these days to just think ""politicians are all evil and selfish with no beliefs"", which is probably why Russell Brand is so popular among teenage anarchists, but then when you actually ask somebody to give examples showing that all the politicians are evil and selfish, they usually fail or give an example that completely demonstrates a complete lack of understanding when it comes to how the country is run. Too many people think they're entitled to something for nothing these days and are not willing to work hard to get to where they want to be. Very few people are actually being pushed down and pinned by the governments decisions, get a bit of chalk on your hands and go and get what you want, because unless you're in the Royal Family, it's not going to be given to you."

maisiewilliams,30xb9z,BlindStark,2,Wed Apr 1 00:22:22 2015 UTC,Not him but I made two:  2560x1920  1920x1080  If you need another resolution for a phone or something I can probably make you one.
maisiewilliams,30xb9z,kaizeru,1 point,Wed Apr 1 04:31:06 2015 UTC,Man this is perfect for my Xperia which uses a scrolling wallpaper. Thanks for your time.
maisiewilliams,30xb9z,kaizeru,1 point,Wed Apr 1 04:39:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe he did his own version with photoshop or something. Sadly I never had the skill for those programs, paint was always my secret weapon to cut picture's parts."
maisiewilliams,30xb9z,BlindStark,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:44:56 2015 UTC,Paint still works! I don't have a Photoshop on my new computer yet and I used to paint to make these:  2560x1920  1920x1080
maisiewilliams,30xb9z,Khal_Me_Drogo,1 point,Wed Apr 1 04:32:28 2015 UTC,I made my own version in photoshop.  This is how it looks on my phone
maisiewilliams,30xb9z,kaizeru,2,Wed Apr 1 05:18:02 2015 UTC,It fits really well.  I love this one as Arya. http://imgur.com/MVQWivt
maisiewilliams,30xb9z,Khal_Me_Drogo,2,Tue Mar 31 18:56:30 2015 UTC,Could you please post your image? It has more background and doesn't have the 'glamour' watermark.

maisiewilliams,306uup,ApplesandEve,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:47:06 2015 UTC,In this case my comment was about Maisie in general. I think I just don't like white very much.
