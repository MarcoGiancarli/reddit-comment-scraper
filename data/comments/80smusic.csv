80smusic,3dq492,TheHorseWasADiabetic,3,Sat Jul 18 10:21:28 2015 UTC,One of the most underated songs of the 80's.
80smusic,3dp73q,Elderthedog,6,Sat Jul 18 03:05:26 2015 UTC,"Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor."
