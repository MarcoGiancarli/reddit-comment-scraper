bobdylan,3e2dm0,rotsky_1,5,Tue Jul 21 17:53:57 2015 UTC,Vol. 13 - a 7-disc box set of Dylan's unreleased iPhone voice memos.  Vol. 14 - a 2-disc set composed of two songs on each album that aren't even Dylan's.  Vol. 15 - a 90-disc box set composed entirely of reproducible napkins and scrap pieces of paper that might have possibly been written by Dylan. They will redesign a turntable (Jack White will somehow have a hand in this) that is able to play music from pieces of paper. It will include 3 discs made entirely from paper mâché in which Dylan recites his favourite Russian fairy tales to the beat of 'Uptown Funk'.

Although, I could see it being possible. How much of this stuff could exist that we haven't heard? I hope it's not something like 30 takes of each song from Highway 61 and Bringing It All Back Home."

bobdylan,3dvi1h,sonnezlacloche,13,Sun Jul 19 21:39:13 2015 UTC,"One of his biographers (I can't remember which one, sorry), when discussing A Hard-Rain's a Gonna Fall, said something along the lines of, ""at some point, you have to consider that maybe he just saw a white ladder all covered with water.""   The idea being, maybe sometimes he just wrote words because they sounded nice.  That being said, Visions of Johanna has kept me occupied for a while.  I've always wondered if the ""Little Boy Lost"" isn't Bob himself."
bobdylan,3dvi1h,droughtypol,8,Sun Jul 19 22:15:50 2015 UTC,"Oh, ""Visions of Johanna"" is a beautiful tangle of imagery. The thing about this song is that there are the lines, the stanzas, then the whole, and you have to piece everything together to come out with a good interpretation. Sounds simple enough, but in ""Visions of Johanna"" it's difficult to find one precise meaning for the different parts because they alter each other's meaning so thoroughly. I've often ended up ping-ponging back and forth without any conclusions.   It seems that this is the case with most of Dylan's songs from the '65 and '66 period--they seem to say so much, but upon closer inspection it all falls apart (""the sun's not yellow, it's chicken,"" ""on the back of the fish truck that loads""). It's as though the listener can only get so close before logic fails, kind of like impressionistic paintings. We try to understand the whole through the parts, but the parts mean nothing without the whole. Where does that leave us?   I think that it's this unattainability that makes Dylan's work legit pieces of poetry. He was heavily influenced by Beat poetry and French Symbolism, and it seems like he combined both to make something new, bordering on surrealism but not quite there. In my opinion, the work he put out in '65 and '66 are lyrically his best in terms of intricacy and aestheticism (his thought-dreams of white ladders covered with water are somethin' else)."
bobdylan,3dvi1h,absee,8,Sun Jul 19 23:27:26 2015 UTC,"""The sun's not yellow, it's chicken,"" makes a whole lot of sense in the context of the verse: John the Baptist, who heralded Christ appearance, is so revolted by the violence and torture that the second coming of Christ is committing, he vomits. The second coming, meanwhile, now known as the Commander in Chief, or President, is a John-Wayne-like macho man who threatens to kill all who are weaker than him - he's so blinded by his rage that he mistakenly attributes an emotion to the sun's yellow color - since it's yellow, it's afraid, or chicken. The President of the US believes himself strong and braver than the motherfucking sun.  Doesn't fall apart at all, it's a beautiful condemnation of the violence of christianity, the US in Vietnam and pop-culture of early 60's."
bobdylan,3dvi1h,0andre0,2,Mon Jul 20 02:49:08 2015 UTC,"You did what I wanted to do, but way more elegantly and completely. Kudos."
bobdylan,3dvi1h,Pop_pop_pop,2,Mon Jul 20 03:49:59 2015 UTC,"I think that's reading too deeply into it. In pretty much all of his interviews he says his music has no deeper ""meaning."" His book Tarantula is a great example of this. In No Direction Home (the documentary), the camera zooms in on some of his prose writing. He just wrote stuff that sounded interesting and rhymed.  I don't really believe that much of his music, especially Bringing It All Back Home through Blonde On Blonde, has a real meaning. Some of it is obviously meaningful, like Sad Eyed Lady (later admitted to be about his wife in Desire) and Like A Rolling Stone, but the more confusing songs simply don't meaning, and he wrote them to sound interesting and catchy. He's a ""song and dance man.""   Of course, maybe he was creating his ""image"" of a misunderstood musician and creating his mystique, but I doubt it."
bobdylan,3dvi1h,SOPA_NO,4,Mon Jul 20 06:31:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's a fool's errand to try to fix an interpretation, especially a narrative interpretation, to some of his songs. I've always believed that in that first Playboy Interview (1966), he essentially admitted that the surreal or nonsensical nature of his lyrics was the result of trying to mimic traditional music from the back door, trying to pick the lock; coming up in a vacuum with what happened organically as the result of decades and decades of interpretation of uncodified material in the hands of hundreds of performers.  ""You'd think that the traditional-music people could gather from their songs that mystery - just plain simple mystery - is a fact, a traditional fact...It strikes me funny that people actually have the gall to think that I have some kind of fantastic imagination. It gets very lonesome. But anyway, traditional music is too unreal to die. It doesn't need to be protected. Nobody's going to hurt it. In that music is the only true, valid death you can feel today off a record player. But like anything else in great demand, people try to own it. It has to do with a purity thing. I think its meaninglessness is holy."""

""he Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly Saying, “Death to all those who would whimper and cry” And dropping a barbell he points to the sky Saying, “The sun’s not yellow it’s chicken”""  Basically, the C-in-C is using political double talk... No, you are right, it is convoluted."
bobdylan,3dvi1h,Pop_pop_pop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:47:21 2015 UTC,"Think of it like a Picasso painting.  Every line, every shape on the image is a real thing, and if you squint just right, you can see it.  If someone who knows tells you what it is, you can see it, or maybe you'll just take it for granted.  Many of his songs are similar.  Lines and phrases don't mean anything in a linear sense, and may not even be related to each other, but each one of them represents something."

Something about this contrast makes the dwarf ""scream/As he weeps to wicked birds of prey/Who pick up on his bread crumb sins.""

bobdylan,3dvi1h,ThinWildMercury1,4,Tue Jul 21 17:58:36 2015 UTC,"Ballad Of A Thin Man? Though I guess this is purposefully confusing given the theme of the song is not knowing what's happening and a general sense of nothing being quite as it seems, at least from Mr. Jones' perspective."
bobdylan,3dvi1h,ThinWildMercury1,4,Sun Jul 19 21:49:07 2015 UTC,"Dylan has stated as much that it was a sort of diatribe against the media who tried but couldn't possibly understand the meaning of Dylan's work.   He said:   ""This is a song I wrote a while back in response to people who ask me questions all the time. You just get tired of that every once in a while. You just don't want to answer no more questions. I figure a person’s life speaks for itself, right? So, every once in a while you got to do this kind of thing, you got to put somebody in their place... So this is my response to something that happened over in England. I think it was about '63, '64. Anyway the song still holds up. Seems to be people around still like that. So I still sing it. It's called 'Ballad Of A Thin Man'.""   Mr Jones is essentially an embodiment of all those reporters who badgered Dylan in '64 and '65 (particularly over his electric conversion). I like to think that this interview is the non-musical narrative version of 'Ballad of a Thin Man'. What confuses people the most is that weird way in which it was told - with prose partly influenced by Arthur Rimbaud, to whom Dylan bears a stylistic similarity. The true intention of the song is clouded by all this odd imagery.  It's a very angry song, an attribute often supposed to be the result of his alleged LSD taking during that time (which accounts for both the odd images and the angry nature of the song)."
bobdylan,3dvi1h,strangerzero,2,Sun Jul 19 22:12:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've heard plenty of people say that Time Magazine reporter is the embodiment of Mr. Jones, though he would have already written the song when he did that interview.    Interesting fact about Ballad Of A Thin Man I've shared on here before, Black Panther leader Huey P. Newton was convinced the song was a comment on racism in American society, as depicted at the end of this scene in I'm Not There"

I suppose all that is enough to make a man question who his friends really are.  Never done LSD, but from what I've read psychedelics like that aren't usually prone to cause anger. This quote from him: ""But LSD is not for groovy people; it's for mad, hateful people who want revenge"" seems like a recapitulation of Highway 61 Revisited, and is the possible source for all those theories that LSD made him more cynical."

I remember it because he specified that part. During the funeral, the priest quoted a passage from the bible about how everyone has castles in heaven or something along those lines. So for him, that line could've been about his friend in one of her many mansions in god's house, protected from hell.   Which is a pretty neat observation. I've always loved the song, but figured it was about a pretty girl a bit past her prime, working the same job she had when she was young. So that guy's take away added another layer for me.  But you know, I've always thought, since these songs are meant for mass consumption. Where you have Bob penning those words, singing them and releasing them, their meaning are not in his domain anymore. It doesn't matter what he meant by them, because we all take away bits and pieces from it. Not saying it's not interesting to know where his head was at, but with Bob, you just never know."

""Mama, You've Been On My Mind"" is another one that hits me . I might also throw ""Roll On John"" in there (I know it isn't exactly a heartbreak song, but it is heartbreaking). ""Love Sick"" is another one."
bobdylan,3dhb2h,bastite,2,Thu Jul 16 13:15:28 2015 UTC,"Just re-listened to ""Sara"". I think it's possibly the saddest song on Earth (if you know its backstory)"

bobdylan,3ddqjh,aheadyriser,5,Wed Jul 15 13:53:50 2015 UTC,"I think it's a song dedicated to the downtrodden - it's a hopeful song that supposes there's something on the horizon for even the underdog and that the strikes of lightning are a unifying force. That the downtrodden are unified under this shared, dominating force of lightning; basically Dylan's version of John Donne's ""ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.""   ""Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake/ tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked/ tolling for the coutcast, burnin' constantly at stake/ an' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'""  ""Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts... tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute/ tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the/ mistitled prostitute.""  ""For the countless confused, accused, misused/ strung-out ones an' worse/ an' for every hung-up person in the whole wide/ univere"".  It supposes there's redemption for all those beaten down people. It's a very rich song, lyrically, and I think a song which you would have no trouble calling poetry."
bobdylan,3ddqjh,Buck1Mulligan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:53:12 2015 UTC,"I certainly agree that it's one of his finest displays of poetry. The connections to Rimbaud are made plenty of times with this song, but I absolutely think that the lightning is what he views as a unifying force.   I like the idea that the lightning might even symbolise JFKs death, and that could play on to the idea of bells tolling for the dead since JFK was seen by many as an agent of change for the downtrodden.   The last verse also gives me the idea that the downtrodden are the ones who realize that everyone in the universe, even the ones who are oppressing themselves, are united by the idea of Freedom, or in this case a force of nature."
bobdylan,3ddqjh,CenturiesChild,3,Wed Jul 15 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"It's one of those songs which I don't listen to very often, but every time I do it absolutely blows me away. I think it's one of his most beautiful, and one of his most well executed songs. His phrasing is immaculate. Could you imagine writing down those lyrics and singing them so succinctly and perfectly?  Ultimately I think it's a song about hope. It's a hopeful song, and it's actually harder to write a hopeful song than it is to write a melancholic pessimistic one, but naturally, somehow Dylan does/did it with ease."

bobdylan,3d9o8x,PQQKIE,16,Tue Jul 14 21:23:51 2015 UTC,"Townes Van Zandt.  Steve Earle famously said that Townes Van Zandt is the best songwriter in the whole world and he'd stand on Bob Dylan's coffee table in his cowboy boots and say that. To which Townes Van Zandt commented ""I've met Bob Dylan and his bodyguards, and I don't think Steve could get anywhere near his coffee table."""
bobdylan,3d9o8x,TheSouthernThing,10,Tue Jul 14 18:05:06 2015 UTC,"Townes was an absolutely fantastic songwriter and musician, but he lacks that certain chameleon-like quality Dylan has. Dylan wrote a lot of songs that lived in the in-between space between genres, in addition to having entire phases of his career devoted to a particular genre (folk in the early 60s, rock for most of the mid-60s through the 70s, with some country sprinkled in, gospel music and Christian rock in the 80s, and blues/blues rock for much of the time since 1997). Townes had a pretty consistent sound for most of his career, so I wouldn't call him ""the next Dylan"", I'd just call him one of the greatest songwriters who ever lived."
bobdylan,3d9o8x,metatron207,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:33:32 2015 UTC,"I agree Townes didn't cover as many genres or go electric but to be fair Dylan has already outlived Townes by 20+ years.  Also I've never thought of Dylan's strength as being the multi-genre artist that he is, a lot of his most influential work was during his folk stage or his early electric work.    I did read one story about Townes being shorted money for a show (possibly the money was stolen or something) in Texas and the Allman Brothers who were also in town offering to play the next night's gig with him to try to make up for the lost cash.  I would love to hear Townes backed by the Allman Brothers.   I'd just call him one of the greatest songwriters who ever lived.   Which in my book makes him more like Dylan than anyone else I've heard.  Jim James of My Morning Jacket is someone I think has excelled in a lot of different genres but that doesn't make me think of Dylan.  Honestly with Jack White's different bands and his bluegrass work on the Cold Mountain soundtrack he's covered almost as many genres as Dylan, again that doesn't make me think he's almost as good Dylan because Dylan's strength to me was always his songwriting.  That's just my opinion though, you're definitely correct on the genre-bending and switching that Dylan achieved that so few others are able to achieve."

Amazing songwriter, a technically weak voice, and he changes it up pretty much every album with a lot of different projects happening.   I guess as a direct ""next Bob Dylan,"" Tallest Man On Earth would fit. But, I don't think he's anywhere near influential enough to be named that. That, and he doesn't sound very unique or interesting in my opinion. He is a great writer, though!  Taylor Goldsmith of Dawes is one of the greatest songwriters I've heard since probably Neil Young. They opened for Dylan a few years ago and even Dylan told Taylor about how much he liked ""A Little Bit of Everything."" But, again, it's hard to say he is the next Dylan, because there's more to that name than just being a great songwriter."

I've had so many friends try to get me into his music, but everything I've heard really rubs me the wrong way. Admittedly it's been a few years since I listened to any of his work. I just remember that his lyrics all struck me as being pretentious rather than profound. It's obvious he's a smart guy, and technically proficient in his writing...I just couldn't connect with any of it.  I'm surprised that no one here has mentioned Beck yet. Like Dylan, Beck had a stretch of his career where he played around with a lot of nonsense lyrics and waste words but still managed to come up with meaningful lyrics; like Dylan, he's dabbled with a bunch of different sounds; and like Dylan, he has more of a monotonous voice that causes you to focus on the words, rather than a melodious voice that draws you to focus more on the music.  Edit: Downvotes for disliking Oberst, or for comparing Beck to Dylan? I don't care about the votes, I just want to talk about it. We all came to this thread for barstool discussion, didn't we?"

It's not just about the quality of his songwriting or his gritty, down-to-earth style; it's the fact that he heard what his culture was saying and was able to put it into song-form. He was, quite literally, the voice of a generation.  Have we had anything like that for the few generations that have followed?

bobdylan,3d9o8x,peki39,-1,Tue Jul 14 23:21:50 2015 UTC,"A lot of the artists I see mentioned were literally playing shows with dylan in his prime. If we're talking about newer artists, then it's hands-down, no contest John Darnielle of The Mountain Goats.   I'm a huge Dylan fanatic and I think John is the better songwriter of the two. He was a poet and is an award winning author and that seeps into his music. He tells stories through his albums, but changes character perspectives throughout the album but in a way that's hard to notice. After propably 50+ playthroughs, I'm still trying to figure out the ""narrator"" of some songs on All Hail West Texas And none of his albums feel 'forced' like some concept albums do.  His writing is mostly about people, some broken, some homesick, some with wanderlust.    His newest album is (don't laugh) about Professional wrestling, except it isn't about professional wrestling. It's about giving help, but not receiving it when you really need it. It's about death. It explores the good guy/bad guy dichotomy that is prevalent in wrestling, and how after being the good guy your whole life while never being in the receiving end of that ""good"", sometimes to survive you have to ""turn heel"", which is wrestling talk for becoming a bad guy. Fantastic album, and you'll hardly even know it's about wrestling. I think it may be the best of his career. It's called Beat The Champ and it's up in its entirety on YouTube.  He's not political like Dylan, and doesn't have the 60's hippy bullshit pseudo-intellectualism lyrics that Dylan sometimes wrote ex. ""Nobody's free, even the birds are chained to the sky.""  I love Dylan, almost to the point of obsession. But he was the champ in his time, and that time has passed, and now John Darnielle holds the belt.  Hail Satan."

Or Isaac Brock's of Modest Mouse. Those are my 3 favorite song writers of ALL TIME but they all made some music that is downright unlistenable to me, and why should I hide those views? It doesn't detract from my love if their body of work and I don't say it with malice, it's just my personal opinion."
bobdylan,3d9o8x,BabyBlueSedan88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:55:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with all three of you guys. I always think that this business of people saying the next Bob Dylan is frankly dumb because there was a time and a place and he filled it and made it his own. If we are only saying the level of songwriting, I'd say John and even then he may be better. All I have to say is the Alpha Cycle. His ability to tie an intricate string of songs all over into stories is his own amazing gift to songwriting."

bobdylan,3ctv9u,timwenzel,15,Fri Jul 10 19:01:21 2015 UTC,"I think that 'hobo' vibe comes from Woody Guthrie's influence on him. Woody Guthrie was identified as being a sort of hobo, wandering around America - usually hopping on trains or 'riding the rails' - and singing hobo ballads. If you listen to the song 'Song for Woody' on Dylan's first album, it makes reference to Guthrie and his associates.   In America, in the 1930s, the Great Depression forced many americans out of work, and so a great number of men (and some children) took to riding the rails, hoping to get off somewhere where they could find work. Guthrie's songs dealt with his own experiences in the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression.   Bob Dylan was himself influenced (as many of the beat generation were) by this sort of nomadic lifestyle, and tried very early on his career to be like his idol, Woody Guthrie. So his music (especially his first few albums) has that sort of Hobo sound to it."
bobdylan,3ctv9u,Desolationrose,2,Fri Jul 10 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"This is seriously one of the best answers to any question I've seen on this subreddit.   I would also add that Dylan was heavily influenced by early American Folk music, especially these recordings.  This Anthology is the primordial soup from where two of the three great veins of American Music (Blues and Country - Jazz being the third) would spring. Some of it is very old and odd and just plain weird, but always fascinating. There is a relationship between these and Dylan's Basement Tapes sessions."

bobdylan,3ctv9u,horkenlad,0,Sat Jul 11 02:55:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure exactly, but I do know that Bob Dylan was influenced by a group of authors called the ""Beat Generation"", which gave rise to Beat culture which consisted of, according to Wikipedia: ""rejection of standard narrative values, the spiritual quest, exploration of American and Eastern religions, rejection of materialism, explicit portrayals of the human condition, experimentation with psychedelic drugs, and sexual liberation and exploration"". Maybe Bob sees some connection between that Beat culture and hobos, as they both go against traditional norms."
bobdylan,3ctlc0,bastite,2,Fri Jul 10 17:49:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's a very interesting song for a few different reasons. In a way it's a quintessential Empire Burlesque song, and '80s Dylan song in particular, in that there are parts of it that work really well and parts that don't.  It's also interesting because of the (deceptively simple) message, which sticks out to me, especially considering it's not so long after the Christian period, when ""Trust Jesus"" was a much more common theme. But then, there's the last two lines of the bridge: ""Don't put your hope in ungodly man/or be a slave to what somebody else believes."""
bobdylan,3ctlc0,DietVanillaBS,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"Not one of his all-time best songs, but still a decent one. Certainly one of the better from that album. The lyrics don't blow my mind away, they're not very original, but I like them nonetheless. It's a good song to put on when you're in ones of those ""Fuck the world, I don't need nobody"" moods, along with 'Positively 4th Street'."

The other two tracks are from the same performance only with Bob providing backing vocals to Ramblin' Jack Elliott.  4 & 5 - are outtakes from the Desire sessions.  6,7 & 8 - from the John Hammond TV Special.  9,10 & 11 - are taken from Renaldo & Clara.

The most expensive one I paid for was Blonde on Blonde ($40 Canadian). The rest ranged from $7-$25 Canadian. (I got Slow Train Coming for free).  Over $1000 for sure. :( damn, oh well... worth it.  EDIT: I'm not sure how my math was so far off.... It would be more like $300-$400 CAD."
bobdylan,3cqv1v,yourexzacklyright,2,Fri Jul 10 02:21:18 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth it. Blonde On Blonde has been my recent go-to album. But I just realized I'm missing everything between John Wesley Harding and Before The Flood, any suggestions?"
bobdylan,3cqv1v,yourexzacklyright,2,Fri Jul 10 04:08:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say Nashville Skyline. A complete dive into country music. It's got a few good hits, as well as some good lesser known stuff. Plus it's got Johnny Cash featured on Girl From The North Country.  For me, anything after that and before Planet Waves was the lowest point. New Morning isn't terrible though."

As the 50th anniversaries of many of his great albums of the 60s pass by, I like to try and live through a period I was born far too late from. Put on a record and pretend I am listening to it on its initial release day. For me, many of the lesser-known songs are fresh, as for the longest time I was mostly only familiar with the mega hits."
bobdylan,3cqv1v,horkenlad,2,Fri Jul 10 04:42:25 2015 UTC,"Hell ya. I was born in 91, ~50 years before Bob, so I always imagine myself releasing his first albums when he's my age, and it's just so hard to do! The depth of lyrics he had at 22 is extraordinary."
bobdylan,3cqv1v,aheadyriser,2,Fri Jul 10 04:51:46 2015 UTC,"On top of what OP said, out of all those albums I liked new morning the best. Nashville Skyline is great, but I never really had the urge to go back to it as much as new morning, or sometimes self portrait. I feel like these albums get a bad rap because of what people were expecting at the time, but I really think they stand out as some of Dylan's most interesting music. I'd say top two of that period is New Morning and Nashville."

Lots of new morning songs on there, as well as Nashville Skyline too. A couple versions of Went To See The Gypsy which are both awesome. Great wigwam alternate take. Copper Kettle. Only A Hobo. This Evening So Soon and etc.Probably my favorite official bootleg and easily has some of my favorite bob recordings easily. It may be my favorite release of his ever, this or basement tapes. Play it real loud on a quality system and it'll be be like bob is right there with you in the room. Just a masterpiece of Americana if you ask me."
bobdylan,3cqv1v,andersma,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:53:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's definitely one of my favorites as well. This Evening So Soon is one of my favorites from that collection because like you said, you get the feeling that you're sitting in that room listening to Bob improv. Unfortunately a lot of people I talk to don't regard that period of Bob's career as some of his best stuff, but for Americana fans and fans of classic folk music it's got so much to offer."
bobdylan,3cqv1v,andersma,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:15:43 2015 UTC,"I was never into self portrait till the bootleg came out. I had heard it a couple times, but I guess I never really listened to it or something. Not sure I've heard the ""DYLAN"" album and Planet waves has a few tunes I like , but Nashville Skyline, new morning and even the soundtrack to Pat Garrett  with Knockin and The Billy song are amazing. The guy was just trying different things that all started with John Wesley Harding, or ended with John Wesley Harding. I'm not sure. That record is kind of an amalgam of his writing more on a political tone like he always had, but more laid back and easy going music sounds. This is also when the basement tapes where recorded. It's kind of like this was his serious material while he was off jerking around with THE BAND. I don't know this stuff just came to me now. Yeah I'm listening to John Wesley Harding now and i forgot how good it was. It's kind of his forgotten masterpiece."

It was mostly a last ditch attempt to profit off of his music by releasing a collection of outtakes. Bob had zero input into this release. He had switched labels and announced his first major tour since 1966. With the pubic excitement of this, Columbia released this album.   Two outtakes from the Self Portrait album, and seven more from New Morning.  He would eventually return to Columbia Records in 1975."

bobdylan,3cpk7b,Desolationrose,6,Thu Jul 9 19:18:44 2015 UTC,"I suppose ol' A.J Weberman's ""Dylan to English Dictionary"" would keep you entertained - for a price. It's a 500 page book with interpretations of Dylan's lyrics, as divined by Weberman himself.   A.J Weberman supposes that a lot of Dylan songs are addressed to himself, as in some secret code. ""Where are You Tonight"" is, according to Weberman, about a 1972 encounter they had - when Dylan found Weberman rooting through his garbage and the two had some sort of scuffle.  If you've got 32 dollars, and can sleep soundly at night knowing that you've given money to A.J Weberman, you might pick up the book. I can't justify spending 32 dollars on baseless interpretations by a madman, but maybe you can."

You can watch some of his insights, including further Dylan interpretations (highlights include 'Bob Dylan has AIDS' and 'Bob Dylan wants to assassinate Obama'), for free on his YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/ajweberman/videos"
bobdylan,3cpk7b,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Fri Jul 10 13:20:40 2015 UTC,"In the 'documentary' (a.k.a. powerpoint presentation mashed up with badly filmed and badly lit 'interviews' with secondary characters) ""Inside Bob Dylan's Jesus Years"", A.J. Weberman gets the final word and it is about his interpretation of 'Precious Angel', which according to him is deeply anti-semetic. I don't recall his precise reasoning, but it was a load of bullshit.    I wondered why the maker would allow this to be included in the 'film', but then I checked and saw that he has also made three documentaries 'proving' president Obama is secretly a Kenyan muslim communist. So there's that."
bobdylan,3cpk7b,Whooptheefuckingdoo,2,Fri Jul 10 18:16:23 2015 UTC,"The Ballad of a Thin Man interpretation makes a lot of sense to me, at least it seems to be heading in a particular direction. Dylan was using an awful lot of fanciful, ""throwaway"" language in the mid-sixties (something he lamented when releasing JWH) but I always thought this song had too many possible references to a gay or effeminate man to be coincidental. After all, it's a dis song; maybe Dylan decided to add another layer to the dis."
bobdylan,3cpk7b,metatron207,2,Fri Jul 10 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. It could be argued that the diss is aimed at people who had no problem jumping on the black civil rights bandwagon yet who would be shocked by homosexual behaviour and would never extend any civil rights to oppressed gay people.

For instance, Maggie's Farm doesn't make any sense until you realize that he wrote it during his transition from folk to electric - and that 'Maggie's Farm' is representative of the folk scene (most of the songs from that album are critical of the folk scene). Tarantula just seems like a side project he might have started, then bored with quickly, and then churned it out because he was being pushed to finish it by his manager.  Despite what the singer says in many of his early interviews, nearly all of his songs have a distinct idea they're trying to push, sometimes in a more confused prose. But if you do look at the lyrics, in the context in which they were written, you begin to see meaning. The book doesn't make sense, even knowing that context."
bobdylan,3cry9h,BamaDillert,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:52:15 2015 UTC,"What you've described are not messages or meanings, but interpretations. If you take that interpretation of Maggie's Farm faithfully, then No More Auction Block (which Dylan didn't write) means the same thing, and Dylan performed and recorded that at the beginning of his tenure as the center of the folk revival world. What's really the difference between It's All Over Now, Baby Blue and Man of Constant Sorrow?  My theory is just as valid: that Dylan arrived at these seemingly nonsensical songs by intentionally randomizing the language in an effort to emulate the mysterious turns in traditional folk music, turns that became embedded there as a result of decades of oral-tradition sharing and being handled by hundreds and hundreds of interpreters each with no codified version. What Leadbelly and Mance Lipscomb arrived at organically, Dylan arrived at by manipulation. Which, of course, is not to reduce Dylan's genius, but to be in awe of it. My only evidence to support this theory--besides the songs--is Dylan's own insistence that ""mystery is an essential fact"" of folk music.  I suppose that if I wrote songs in the manner that Dylan was writing them at the time, and had to write a book, I would probably write a book like Tarantula."
bobdylan,3cry9h,gwmercure,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:16:37 2015 UTC,"Tarantula is...kind of one of those things you have to love for what it is, it's nonsensical but enjoyable at the same time.   The book publication was pushed back a number of times, most significantly after the crash in '66, and from what I've read I'm not sure Bob had that much in mind for the book, more just writing for writing's sake."

bobdylan,3cnnvt,PQQKIE,2,Thu Jul 9 21:02:21 2015 UTC,"thx for the post. great stuff. as much as I love both versions of  'Idiot Wind', I still think the original album cut is the keeper."
bobdylan,3cnnvt,PQQKIE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:31:01 2015 UTC,"Glad you enjoyed it!  In terms of Idiot Winds, I would say Fort Collins 'Hard Rain' version is the towering one. Compared to that one, the New York IW offers a much greater contrast, which is why I prefer it to the 'in between' album version."
bobdylan,3cnnvt,strangerzero,2,Fri Jul 10 13:08:21 2015 UTC,"Some of it could just be what I am used to. If I had either of those versions embedded in my DNA like the original, I might just say the opposite. The thing that kills me is that Dylan can just make up alternate lyrics seemingly on the fly. And the lyrics are as awesome as the ones that you've memorized. Missed 'from the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capital' on one of the cuts. Also, on the first released cut I preferred how he drawled out the 'slowly' on the the 'spring time turned slowly to autumn'. It's all good."
bobdylan,3cnnvt,DylanFloyd,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:38:48 2015 UTC,"I think Dylan made the right decision. The released version is superior on every track. Not that these are bad performances at all, but the official versions have a certain spark that these outtakes lack. Thanks for the upload!"
bobdylan,3cnnvt,bastite,6,Thu Jul 9 12:44:55 2015 UTC,"It's a 'reason vs. heart' thing for me. Looking at it objectively, I agree: as an album, the released version is better than the test pressing.   Having said that, I personally listen to the New York versions far more than the released album: Dylan is more out in the open, an openness that makes BOTT what it is, and on some songs (notably Idiot Wind) I prefer the New York lyrics.   But I do understand that the full 'open E' album can grow a bit static musically and come across as glumly and depressingly as a Leonard Cohen record."
bobdylan,3cnnvt,solarandlunar,3,Thu Jul 9 13:12:16 2015 UTC,"But I do understand that the full 'open E' album can grow a bit static musically and come across as glumly and depressingly as a Leonard Cohen record.   LOL  As far as the sessions themselves, one of the most important bootlegs of his to pick up IMO.  And I tend to agree that a case can be made for either version in almost every song.  I like most of the released versions better, especially something like Tangled, but on the Idiot Wind outtake (and the bootleg series cut) there is a tenderness that doesn't come through on the album cut.  Not to say it is ""better"" but just different in mood."
bobdylan,3cnnvt,bastite,2,Thu Jul 9 14:26:39 2015 UTC,"The released version seems better for a commercial release. As is often the case with Dylan, these songs have so many facets that each version just reveals a new layer."
bobdylan,3cnnvt,bastite,2,Thu Jul 9 20:06:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean - I think we appreciate the New York version so much precisely because the released version exists. If the New York recordings was what we got, we wouldn't probably like them as much.  They're good alternatives to the album but I think the released versions got it just right."

bobdylan,3cpgne,willydNthebgd,6,Thu Jul 9 18:50:06 2015 UTC,"You said: ""had he not gotten into that motorcycle incident, he would have continued to make some great songs.""  Just my opinion, but some of his finest work occurred after the accident. Blood On The Tracks, Oh Mercy, Infidels, Desire, Nashville Skyline, Time Out of Mind. He's easily equaled, if not surpassed, his pre-1966 output."
bobdylan,3cpgne,bastite,4,Thu Jul 9 20:15:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I totally feel that he's gotten better since 1966. Most recording artists peak, and then burn out. Dylan peaked, fell off, and then surpassed the previous peak. Every time?"
bobdylan,3cpgne,gwmercure,3,Thu Jul 9 22:21:02 2015 UTC,"I think you're going to get the typical 'you're just not looking hard enough' response to this question. There are good artists out there nowadays, but you're right, nothing even comes close to comparing to what Dylan produced in the mid-60s, both lyrically and musically.  There was a lot of hate, a lot of veneration in Highway 61, Bringing it all Back Home, and Blonde on Blonde, specifically for superficial people in Dylan's crowd and the media. If he hadn't crashed his motorcycle, that would have kept him going in the same lifestyle - amphetamines to keep him going through shows, dealing spitefully with journalists, dealing with unruly crowds. All that fueled his material. With that subtracted from his lifestyle, he no longer had to give it such attention, and it more or less forced him to focus on inspirations closer to home. He moved from wild, cynical put-downs to mostly reserved, introspective material. It was still his life he talked about in his songs, but more plainly and with less mystery.   However, I think if he kept going as he was, without the motorcycle accident to slow him down, it's likely he would have burnt himself out creatively, left the business of music altogether, or he would have ended up taking a break from performing anyway (though perhaps not as long as the hiatus the crash caused).   Dylan's greatest material for me will always be that hallucinatory sound produced in the mid-60s, but what he did produce after his crash is still good too. He's never quite managed to regain what he had done in '65 and '66, but I don't think he's ever tried to. If he kept trying to do the whole 'electric folk' thing, I think he would have wore out what the genre is capable of (running the risk of becoming a monotonous, one-trick pony), and I'm glad he moved on to try other things.   I don't really seek out modern music, but I'm sure there are good artists out there, though incomparable to Dylan. I can't say that I've listened to anything even remotely close to Dylan without it seeming like a poor imitation. No one else could possibly replicate such a man, and I suppose I'm glad that his type of music isn't the sort that can be replicated by any musician, new or old."
bobdylan,3cpgne,Buck1Mulligan,2,Thu Jul 9 22:22:55 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly feel Dylan has a special gift we are unlikely to see again in our lifetimes. But, people like Leonard Cohen and Tom Waits can often come close. There's also good new music out. I've been listening to John Fullbright and Jason Isbell recently. Maybe you'd like them? Another conversation Id enjoy would be learning what new artists other Dylan fans enjoy."

bobdylan,3cpgne,gwmercure,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:18:03 2015 UTC,"I think the only way to compare Dylan's music with contemporary popular music is to take as your Dylan sample the music from the first three rock and roll albums: Bringing it All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, Blonde on Blonde, and the '66 tour. It was the closest he came to real pop music. The way it pushed the boundaries and still belonged to something, well, there isn't a lot of music like that on the radio these days."

bobdylan,3ce9z2,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Tue Jul 7 14:34:41 2015 UTC,"Excellent point. Violence and desolation throughout his last few. And on self titled, don't forget the inclusion of In my time of dyin, Fixin to Die, and See that my grave is kept clean. He started this early."
bobdylan,3ce9z2,nutt_butter_baseball,3,Tue Jul 7 14:38:53 2015 UTC,"Very true - death runs throughout. I was referring more to the graphic nature of his lyrics, as particularly Tempest is rather gory (lots of blood, consumption of organs etc.), which is something that isn't unheard of with Bob (""flies buzzing around your eyes / blood on your saddle"" for instance), but the high concentration of it on that album is quite peculiar. Maybe it's just an outlier though - we'll just have to see what the next album of originals brings, I guess.   Although I fear that if we keep this up, we'll realise that most of Bob is just meteorology, death, belligerent women and God."
bobdylan,3ce9z2,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Tue Jul 7 15:01:46 2015 UTC,"I think he said something somewhere along the lines of ""I've been singing songs about death since I was 12 years old""  in a recent interview."

bobdylan,3ces6l,Whooptheefuckingdoo,4,Tue Jul 7 13:24:34 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more. Thank God we can keep the music and forget the reviews.
bobdylan,3ces6l,bizzycarl,2,Tue Jul 7 17:31:53 2015 UTC,"Seriously though. They said of Pink Floyd: ""By their own admission, Pink Floyd will never bring home any blue ribbons for their instrumental abilities. Their mastery of their tools peaks at competence. The illusion of complexity that caused their drooling legions to make wild claims of high-art accomplishment was actually nothing more than the skillful manipulation of elements so simple — the basic three chords everyone else uses — that any collection of bar hacks could grind out a note-for-note reproduction without difficulty."" This was in a review of Wish You Were Here, out in the same year as Blood on the Tracks. 1975 must have been a bitter year at Rolling Stone.   And the rest of the review is just as petty, calling their playing on Dark Side of the Moon 'elementary'. It's like they went out of their way to hire people to be snobbish."

Also, on their 100 greatest artists of all time, they had PF only at 51!    51, behind Led Zeppelin (14), U2 (22), Nirvana (30), Madonna (36), Public Enemy (44) and Run-DMC (48)!"

bobdylan,3cbe3y,RealVinnieBoombatz,4,Mon Jul 6 16:22:25 2015 UTC,Can we just give BOTT the deluxe Bootleg Series work over already?  Disc 1: A remaster of the official original release.  Disc 2: The New York sessions version.  Disc 3: Outakes from both NY and Minnesota sessions.  Disc 4: Live performances of BOTT material.
bobdylan,3cbe3y,RichHixson,4,Mon Jul 6 16:47:35 2015 UTC,"I have to say, for me that would be quite an underwhelming BS. A remaster isn't exactly BS material. The New York sessions have been circulated heavily and from the descriptions of the uncirculated outtakes, there isn't really much to get excited about that hasn't been released yet.   As for live performances, we have BS5 and, furthermore, again, Rolling Thunder #1 has been circulated quite well. As for RTR #2, I'm not quite sure it fits within the 'BOTT' sphere of things.   Basically, it would be a release of what is already available, only in a slightly upgraded quality - then again, that's what they did with the Basement Tapes BS, so they could well do it again.  I'm not quite sure what they can do to a BOTT BS to make it great though, at least without really stretching the remit of 'BOTT' (say, by including Salt Lake '76 as part of it)."
bobdylan,3cbe3y,SurrealistSwimmer,3,Mon Jul 6 17:33:55 2015 UTC,"Personally I really like the official BS series and enjoy how much they do to clean up each track whether I already own the material or not.  I suppose if you wanted to go down the ""It's already been released"" highway then you could make that argument about almost every set so far in the series.  BS 5 only has two BOTT songs (Tangled and SToF). Not sure I would consider that a great source of live BOTT songs.   I'm pretty sure there's a host of unreleased live performance of BOTT material that could easily be included to make up a live disc. Even if they did nothing more but clean up and organize the ""already out there"" live performances I'd be happy.  I think sometimes we hard core collectors have to take a step back and realized that the majority of the record buying public (showing my age) does not have much of this material (if any) and the New York sessions would stir up quite a lot of publicity if and when they are ever officially released. The version I have is good, but I know they could be so much better sonically. Hope we see see something for this Holiday season.  Seeing as how this is the 40th anniversary of BOTT's release, and the fact that many fans and critics consider it to be Dylan's high water mark, it makes sense they would push something out this year."
bobdylan,3cbe3y,RichHixson,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:31:41 2015 UTC,"Sure, a clean-up would be nice, but for me personally it would still be underwhelming. Of course, releasing it would open it up to a far greater audience - you're absolutely correct there - but I would still hope there would be something on it to lure in the 'hardcore collector' - even if on some swanky deluxe edition. Another Self Portrait, Tell Tale Signs etc. had plenty of new material, but it's difficult to do that with BOTT.   As for the release date, I heard it was meant to be the next one, but that recent post on ER seems to suggest it'll be Blonde on Blonde first. Which would kind of make sense - they need to get the '65 and '66 material off the copyright precipice fairly soon after all."

It is a state of observation of many worlds at the same time: the world where Dylan's personal life is believed to be exposed, where there is no fourth wall; the world of American mystery (the ""essential fact"" of folk music: that ""old, weird, America""); the world of the listener--how Dylan is such a supreme actor and inhabits his songs like no other songwriter before or since and how we all relate to the song on a personal level no matter how surreal or exotic or removed or contrived the song is. The thing with Dylan is this: when other singers perform, they make themselves us; when Dylan sings, he makes us all Dylan. It's why we want to know about him, why his mystique is so compelling, so irresistible, so maddening.  These elements are not more evident on any Bob Dylan song than they are on Up to Me. There is no piece of art like it. And there is no song in his catalog that stops me, at least, in my tracks like that song does. And if happens to be playing and I'm too distracted, too diverted, too busy to really notice the way I usually do through the first batch of verses, I will still always, always, always stop and feel that rush of joy and madness and sadness when it gets to ""...So if we never meet again..."""

To say it's anything less than incredible would be a lie - he talks in between playing maybe 15 (?) songs, I can't remember how many for sure, some of which he would never be recorded playing again. And during the interview he weaves his tall tales of growing up with the circus and living in Sioux Falls etc. in line with the Woody Guthrie persona he had going on.

Not only is it underrated by the public, but it was also underrated by Dylan himself. It was recorded during the Oh Mercy Sessions, the producer wanted to included it on the final album, but Dylan disagreed, so it wasn't released until the Bootleg Series 1-3.  It's a great song, has that same atmospheric feel as Most of the Time. You can really tell the producer was the same guy who produced some of U2's 80's songs."

bobdylan,3bsv7t,framwhite,9,Thu Jul 2 00:32:07 2015 UTC,"Well there are always the classic unreleased songs which are often brought up on here, and I'd always recommend listening to, including Up To Me, Abandoned Love (and the far superior live version of this), Blind Willie Mctell, Tell Me Momma.  But to be honest any answer here will only be scratching the surface given Dylan's enormous back catalog and countless hidden gems.    Personally I'd say almost all of his studio albums are worth a listen to bar maybe some of his 80s work and Christmas in the Heart (though some people have soft spots for these), and then if you want to start getting into his back catalog properly all the official bootleg series releases are well worth listening to and contain much of my favorite work of Dylan's.    Hope this helps, and happy listening (I envy people who are still discovering some of Dylan's best stuff)"

I'll skip anything before 1979, as the underrated albums there (JWH, Nashville Skyline, New Morning, Planet Waves, Street-Legal) are all packed with gems and are worth listening to in their entirety.   Spanish Is The Loving Tongue - Dylan (although the album version is probably the worst version of the song he ever did - check out the BS single version instead)   I Believe In You - Slow Train (although the whole album is great)  In The Garden - Saved  Every Grain Of Sand - Shot Of Love  Jokerman - Infidels  I'll Remember You - Empire Burlesque (but check out the superior versions from Farm Aid and Masked & Anonymous)  Emotionally Yours - Empire Burlesque (cheese allergy warning)  Brownsville Girl - Knocked Out Loaded (Lord knows it's the only song worth listening to on that... 'album')  Oh Mercy and anything after Time Out Of Mind are, as with the pre-1979 albums, really worth listening to in their entirety, so I shan't include those songs and I do hope you'll find the time to listen to them, as they too have many excellent tracks on them (leaving you with Not Dark Yet from Time Out Of Mind, Workingman's Blues #2 from Modern Times, Changing Of The Guards from Street-Legal and Going Going Gone from Planet Waves just to illustrate).   EDIT: Of course, once you're done with the albums, there's always the Bootleg Series to explore. And then the bootlegs themselves. So... yeah... enjoy!  :)"
bobdylan,3bsv7t,SurrealistSwimmer,3,Thu Jul 2 00:56:26 2015 UTC,"All I've listened to is from 'The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan to 'Blonde on Blonde' and then Blood on the Tracks and 'Desire'   If that's where you're up to, forget about ""less popular songs"" and get stuck into some of the following albums:   Time Out of Mind.  Some would argue his best album.  Full circle back to traditional folk/blues type material, with amazing layered production. Love & Theft.  Also amazing.  More sprightly than TOOM, from the same period, great sort of retro-folk-Americana.  Smells like wood smoke and civil war battlefields. John Wesley Harding.  A change of pace but still great.   Slow Train Coming.  Christian weirdness, but actually a very good album IMHO. Infidels.  Uneven, but has some of his best songwriting. Oh Mercy - overlooked masterpiece. Modern Times and Tempest - not as good as TOOM, Oh Mercy and L&T from the 'modern' era, but both good albums (MT is better).   If it's overlooked songs then you can't go past Blind Willie McTell.  Find the version with the minimal backing band, piano heavy (Bootleg Series Volume 3 has it, I believe).  In my opinion, close to the best song Dylan has ever written, and it was recorded when his voice was very strong too.  Another truly great non-album track is ""Cross the Green Mountain"".  Came out of nowhere, recorded for a shitty movie, and it's a masterpiece worthy of his best albums.  He has a history of inexplicably leaving great tracks off albums, so there are a shit ton more out there from every era."

To add to that, there's the ""eyes of the idol with the iron head"" line in Jokerman, and the fact that in Paradise Lost much of Satan's legion is composed of pagan idols.   But I think the song is more about Satan as an idea, and not specifically Paradise Lost Satan. Milton gave the most interesting and beautiful account of the story, so a lot of our conception (and thus Dylan's interpretation) of Satan stems from that.  My Dad has always insisted that the song is about Ronald Reagan."

bobdylan,3bk8id,WiredEgo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:48:52 2015 UTC,"I always saw it as being about Jesus. The opening line is about standing on the water. He talks about being ""a friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame."" A big shift in Jesus' teachings from then-current Jewish doctrine is how willing Jesus was willing to be in the presence of, preach to, and even touch people who his followers saw as unworthy or even dangerous. A famous example would be the story of him and the prostitute (woman of shame) who he annointed. Another would be him eating dinner with a tax-collector; probably the closest thing to the the Devil you could find when your following is almost all former fishermen. And he laid hands on and healed a person thought to be possessed by multiple demons.  The parts you talk about Moses are fairly compelling though. Especially ""freedom just around the corner for you."" I would say the promised-land which Moses never got to see is a defining feature of his story."

bobdylan,3aw9k1,hermanlerman,14,Wed Jun 24 00:32:43 2015 UTC,"Some incorrect information here. I don't know what the reaction was, but I know that the prevailing theory behind the white make-up was not to highlight certain features or as protection from stage lights.  Dylan used the make-up sporadically during the first Rolling Thunder tour, on days when performances were being filmed for Renaldo and Clara. The principal inspiration for Renaldo and Clara was a French film called Children of Paradise, which featured a mime character named Baptiste, who wore white-face. That's the inspiration: emulating Baptiste for the performances that would be filmed.  As far as the reaction, the only ""reaction"" I'm aware of that's been documented is the following exchange, paraphrased from memory: Audience Member: ""Why the make-up?"" Dylan: ""I want you to hear my words, not see my face.""  I think it's a compelling look, and it makes for dramatic images. It was used to great effect in I'm Not There when Jim James wore the same make-up.  If I had been there, I imagine my reaction would be ""where has this guy been, what does this represent? What kind of mad things has he been exposed to in his travels? I would have been intrigued. Further, some of the regular songs from that period, you can imagine the narrator/speaker in that make-up, some stray occult cowboy gypsy reporting back from a world none of us will ever see: Isis, One More Cup of Coffee, Romance in Durango..."
bobdylan,3aw9k1,gwmercure,7,Wed Jun 24 13:34:56 2015 UTC,"stray occult cowboy gypsy     Man, that's a perfect description of Rolling Thunder Bob.

I've been listening to a lot more of Van Morrison, and he has that whole wandering gypsy vibe going on too, it's right up my alley."

bobdylan,3aw9k1,SurrealistSwimmer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:22:32 2015 UTC,"There was a kind of whiteface thing in popular culture in the mid-1970s. Think of Joel Grey in the film Cabaret, Marcel Marceau, or Shields and Yarnell.  Dylan fit right in."
bobdylan,3aw9k1,strangerzero,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:16:01 2015 UTC,"From what I've spoken to/read from people who were at the shows and also from the few paper reviews of the '75 shows I've read, the whiteface wasn't as big a deal then as it is now. Most of the concert goers who got to see a 'whiteface show' remember it as just one of the many other mad things happening on stage.   You have to remember, Rolling Thunder was a completely unprecedented endeavour, both in terms of Dylan's career and popular music in general. The things that shocked the audiences most was the number and scale of unreleased songs, the amount of various guests as well as the Dylan/Baez duets (Blowing In The Wind starting in complete darkness as the curtain is raised to reveal Dylan and Baez face to face strumming acoustics). The whiteface, for most of the audience, was just one of the slightly more 'weird' things, alongside the carpets, masks and Ginsberg.   As for the reviews, the ones that mention it seem to generally lump it into the whole 'travelling minstrel gypsy band' lore that has been built up around the Revue from the start.   Dylan himself has given many answers in terms of the inspiration - he said it comes from the film (/u/gwmercure goes into that very well), he also said it was a means of allowing the audience to see his face from further back, whilst some speculate it's a nod to minstrels or, as /u/strangerzero points out, it's just one of those things artists did in the 70s. The truth is probably a combination of all of the above, but all we can do is speculate on this point.   But yes, in short, the reaction was one of intrigue and perplexion, but it's not something people doted on all that much."

I think it was in On the Road with Bob Dylan that Joan Baez (or someone else) said he did it to highlight the most important features of his face, his eyes and his lips.  Regardless, it wasn't a racial thing at all if that's what the original poster was suggesting."

The left-most Dylan and 'Get Born' Bobs can be removed, bringing modern Bob back into view on small screens. The /r/BobDylan / reddit bit can get a facelift and the section between the /r/BobDylan bit and the first Dylan can be scaleable, so that the whole banner is responsive.   Just a though. Some good suggestions in this thread otherwise, but I don't quite find myself screaming ""That's the one!"" with any in particular."
bobdylan,3artuh,SurrealistSwimmer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:13:56 2015 UTC,"I think we need a new banner altogether. The current one isn't eye pleasing, even with your suggested changes. And it's always nice to change it up every so often. Personally, I would suggest someone do a static /r/bobdylan title, with a blank background. Every so often (every month or so) we switch through backgrounds.   Like in /r/pinkfloyd, they have the subreddit name and a small logo as a primary element up front, and then a background of the album covers which is sort of grayed out and can be easily switched. The suggestions here are one-layered, images of banners - like what we already have.  If I had some sort of artistic ability, I'd submit something of my own."

No limit, in math means (at least, how I understand it) that a number sequences actually comes to fruition--if I can word it that way.    So, I've always taken it to mean that love/no limit means that love itself has no limit, that its ends and means are too vast and infinite, that almost anything can happen or make sense under the guise of love.   What does that mean for the song, though?  Basically it explains the juxtapositions like ""She knows there's no success like failure and that failure's no success at all.""  How failure even be considered a success? Well, in love, there's no limit to the ways a failure could be a success.   Maybe that doesn't make any sense, but that's how I've always looked at it."

Several attempts were made by Bob to flesh it out, but unfortunately nothing came of it.  Here's another attempt, or maybe the end part of one attempt -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ubi0E3LTYS0  And the lyrics -  When I'd asked why the painting was deadly nobody...  When I'd ask why the painting was deadly  Nobody could pick up my sign  'Cept for the cook, she was always friendly  But she'd only ask, ""What's on your mind?""  She'd say that especially when it was raining  I'd say ""Oh, I don't know""  But then she'd press and I'd say, ""You see that painting?  Do you think it's been done by Van Gogh?""  The cook she said call her Maria  She'd always point for the same boy to come forth  Saying, ""He trades cattle, it's his own idea  And he also makes trips to the North  Have you ever seen his naked calf bleed?""  I'd say, ""Oh no, why does it show?""  Then she'd whisper in my ear that he's a half-breed  And I'd say, ""Fine, but can he paint like Van Gogh?""  I can't remember his name he never gave it  But I always figured he could go home  Til when he'd gave me his card and said, ""Save it""  I could see by his eyes he was alone  But it was sad how his four leaf clover  Drawn on his calling card showed  That it was given back to him a-many times over  And it most definitely was not done by Van Gogh.  It was either she or the maid just to please me  Though I sensed she could not understand  And she made a thing out of it by saying, ""Go easy  He's a straight, but he's a very crooked straight man.""  And I'd say, ""Does the girl in the calendar doubt it?  And by the way is it Marilyn Monroe?""  But she'd just get salty and say, ""Why you wanna know about it?""  And I'd say, ""I was just wondering if she ever sat for Van Gogh.""  It was either her or the straight man who introduced me  To Jeanette, Camilla's friend  Who later on falsely accused me  Of stealing her locket and pen  When I said ""I don't have the locket""  She said ""You steal pictures of everybody's mother I know""  And I said ""There's no locket  No picture of any mother I would pocket  Unless it's been done by Van Gogh.""  Camilla's house stood on the outskirts  How strange to see the chandeliers destroyed..."

Pennebaker did shoot this footage for Dont Look Back, it wasn't actually put in the film (I'm guessing because of the interruptions).  It's an outtake and iirc it was put on 65 Revisited, which is an extra for Dont Look Back (the footage that wasn't used for the film).  In Dont Look Back we only see It's All Over Now, Baby Blue!"
bobdylan,3an1nf,MrMisantrop,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:16:37 2015 UTC,Is there a full performance of Baby Blue from that Dont Look Back shoot at all? That performance is one of my favorites of all of Dylan's and I'm frustrated that it is so truncated.

bobdylan,3ak2ds,Desolationrose,4,Sat Jun 20 23:37:48 2015 UTC,"I am positive street legal can cure obsessive compulsive disorder, alongside a whole long list of other mental illnesses. It's such a great album. Music is too much of a personal thing to be told what albums are good or not though, if you like an album you like the album. If you can relate or can't relate to the feelings of the music, the words or message it might affect you in a different way. Be open minded Slow Train Coming is a great album too, you mentioned you couldn't get through it, maybe give it some time... you'll come around. New Morning is great. Just listen to the music, and the lyrics let them flow through you, get up and dance if you must. It happens all the time to me. This era of bob(70's-) is a great era for bob. How did you feel about blood on the tracks?"
bobdylan,3ak2ds,lieutenanttom,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:59:41 2015 UTC,"I liked Blood on the Tracks a lot, I think it's one his best albums. It sounds closer to 1960s Dylan than any of his subsequent albums (at least what little I've listened to seemed that way)."

bobdylan,3ak2ds,andersma,3,Sun Jun 21 01:00:31 2015 UTC,"New Morning has some cool songs, but overall is just okay. I made my own track listing by mixing that and stuff from the Another Self Portrait bootleg series and it's way better.   To answer OP, Planet Waves, Street Legal, Shot Of Love, Oh Mercy, Time Out Of Mind (my favorite Dylan album behind Blood On The Tracks), and maybe even one of the 90's acoustic albums like World Gone Wrong.   Dylan has tons of amazing stuff after the 60's. There's even some cool Christian stuff (like Shot Of Love) and I'm not even Christian. Plus, his live shows throughout the years have been amazing. So, check out the bootleg Hold The Fort For What It's Worth and maybe an 81 show. Even the acoustic stuff in 87 was awesome!"
bobdylan,3ak2ds,nostrilz,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:25:15 2015 UTC,Good taste. I think TOOM is his best after BOOT too.

I left If Dogs Run Free just so that that aspect of New Morning wasn't completely abandoned, plus I find the Another Self Portrait version to be a little more tolerable.   If you have any questions, let me know. I love doing this with Dylan albums!"
bobdylan,3ak2ds,Aureolin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:46:28 2015 UTC,That's pretty good! What other album mashups have you done?
bobdylan,3ak2ds,andersma,2,Sun Jun 21 21:02:02 2015 UTC,"They are usually just me shortening the albums (like with Blonde On Blonde), but Time Out Of Mind and Oh Mercy turned out pretty cool. Also, I've always liked the acoustic Blood On The Tracks stuff that is more depressing, so I made an alternate version of that."
bobdylan,3ak2ds,DylanFloyd,3,Sun Jun 21 21:07:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely Love and Theft.  Also Modern Times and Tempest if you can handle his late voice.  And as others have noted, Time Out of Mind, Oh Mercy, and IMO Empire Burlesque are great, plus his solo acoustic albums in the 90s.  And make sure you get the Bootleg Series 1 to 3 if you haven't already."

bobdylan,3ak2ds,35Rhum,2,Sun Jun 21 21:09:22 2015 UTC,"Love & Theft is my favorite of his records. I'll also speak up for Shot of Love. It's the best of his Gospel era, and one of his more overlooked. I love it."
bobdylan,3ak2ds,Awkward_Arab,2,Sun Jun 21 15:01:46 2015 UTC,"Planet Waves, Street Legal, Infidels, Oh Mercy, and Time Out of Mind. I think those are some of Bob's finest records. If you're looking to choose between any of the ones I mentioned, go with Planet Waves, and ""Something There Is About You"" is a good song to start off with, it's a song you can crank all the way up and horribly sing along to."
bobdylan,3ak2ds,Whooptheefuckingdoo,2,Sun Jun 21 15:18:59 2015 UTC,"I'm partial to Street-Legal (1978) myself. It's radically different from anything Dylan had done before. It seems like it's a divise album. Some people don't like it at all (one critic called it ""utterly fake""), while other people, like me, appreciate it immensely for its musical variety, its powerful, convincing and sometimes heart-breaking vocals and for the magical lyrics in some of the songs. 'Changing of the Guards' and 'Where Are You Tonight' are among Dylan's best songs ever.    (Just make sure you get the 1999 mix, ""as Dylan intended it"". The initial release had muddy production. And no, the 'remastered' version on Spotify is not that 1999 mix.)    Another album that you definitly want to check out, is Time Out of Mind (1997). In my opinion, that is one of his top 3 albums. It's a very dark, moody record, steeped in depression and despair. But man, is it beautiful. I never knew misery could sound this wonderfull. This is a very mature Dylan, recounting all the hardships a man faces in life, phrased in such a way that is both universal and personal. It's not a light album, but it is very rewarding.    Lastly, I want to urge you to listen to Oh Mercy (1989). Easily a top 5 Dylan record, no doubt about it. From the first moment I put it on and I heard the very first seconds of the opening track, I was blown away. I thought I had heard it all from Dylan, but this proved me wrong (yet again). It's one wonderful song after another. It's very atmospheric. If 'Most of the Time' doesn't get to you, I don't know what will.    Finally, Dylan did some GREAT songs in the 1980's that sadly didn't end up on his records. They've since been released on Biograph (1985) or on The Bootleg Series, Vol. 1-3 (1991). Don't forget to check out magnificent pieces like 'Foot of Pride', 'When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky' (original version), 'Someone's Got a Hold of my Heart', 'Carribean Wind', 'Series of Dreams' and 'Blind Willie McTell'!"
bobdylan,3ak2ds,solarandlunar,2,Mon Jun 22 01:48:08 2015 UTC,I'll throw Tempest and Shadows in the Night firmly into this category.
bobdylan,3ak2ds,willington123,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:03:22 2015 UTC,"I'll really just reiterate what most have said already, but aside from a few albums which aren't great, but not too bad - I'd say every album of bob's has it's merits. Yes, even Knocked Out Loaded and Down in the Groove - though you might have to look really hard to find those merits for the last two!"
bobdylan,3ak2ds,andersma,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:14:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those two are... rough. I'd even throw Empire Burlesque in there with them. But, you're right. There's at least one decent song on those albums even. And if you're hating the album stuff from a certain time period, you're bound to find 100 awesome live things from then anyway!"
bobdylan,3ak2ds,willington123,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:10:59 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, of course, Empire Burlesque should definitely be in there - though after that previous post I should mention that I have a bit of a weird soft spot for Down in the Groove - I'm not sure why.  But yeah that's definitely true, I've just started getting into the beginnings of the NET - starting in 1988, just after the release of Down in the Groove - having just got a new book about it, so it's definitely cool to hear some incredible live even if the album isn't quite up to par."
bobdylan,3ak2ds,Whooptheefuckingdoo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:51:02 2015 UTC,"I think 'Clean Cut Kid' is a great song, which deserves a lot more attention. Also, 'Trust Yourself' has good lyrics, 'Seeing the Real You at Last' has amazing vocals, and then there's 'Dark Eyes' of course! I even like the other songs, sometimes despite and sometimes because of the 1980's sound if them. The original 'When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky' is vastly superior to the one on Empire Burlesque, but even the disco version has grown on me.    It's far from his best album, but it's better than it gets credit for, in my opinion."
bobdylan,3ak2ds,dorky2,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:09:04 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for more of 60s Dylan, you'll be disappointed.  The man and his music changed over time, which I think is a great thing.  Why not start with Greatest Hits Volume 3?  That has many of the songs that I think were his best from the late 70s and 80s.  And don't miss Time Out of Mind and Love and Theft."
bobdylan,3ak2ds,andersma,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:26:41 2015 UTC,"I've already commented in here, but I just thought about this. If you're having a hard time transitioning into the 80's-present stuff, check out the Bootleg Series Vol. 8. It's definitely in the top 3 BS releases, and I'm sure it's at the top of a lot of people's lists.   It will definitely catch your interest and lead to you to certain albums."

There is some incredible poetry and dark, percussive songwriting on there that's like nothing else ever written. Sure, he was going a little off the deep end during that album, but he's still Bob -- he's still a genius, and even his weirder stuff can speak to you if you open your mind :)   (For the record, I'm not religious at all, but Infidels is still one of my personal favorite albums)."

Was it a fuck you gesture to Bob and his generation? Oh, wait, Bob Marley is from the same generation? It just seemed too ambiguous. Perhaps she just wanted to appeal to Bob's sense of humor.

I'm off tomorrow (flying to Germany for... well... I guess those familiar with Dylan's touring schedule can guess why), but I'd like to offer some quick feedback:    Promotion - sounds like great plan Layout - I agree about the banner. It actually covers a chunk of his career, but only if I view it on my big screen. If I visit the subreddit on my laptop, it cuts off somewhere around Blonde on Blonde Bob, so yes, a bit more of an even spacing would be good. With regards to the CSS, graphics etc., I actually quite like the simple, non-distracting feel of the sub - others may disagree though, so perhaps this could be a more community-driven initiative? Perhaps voting-based, like we did with the subreddit Description Wiki - good idea and I'd be very happy to help with this    As for some 'off the top of my head' ideas:   Regular 'things' - I'd quite like to see the return of weekly/fortnightly/monthly sub debates/events. For instance, discussing an album or bootleg per fortnight or even a film. I was thinking of suggesting we all watch Masked & Anonymous one week and talk about it, although that sort of thing would perhaps work only once we have a wider userbase More informative side-bar? - I'm thinking current tour dates and perhaps more links: boblinks is one conspicuous omission (and Dylanstubs is dead) and perhaps a section with links with concert recordings would be good (the latter can also be covered by the wiki)   All I can think of for now, but I'm sure others will chip in with more suggestions.

What a comeback, only a handful of years since the debacle that was 'Masters of War' in 1991.  He showed he still had it,  new song, great performance, and that idiot had to ruin it."
bobdylan,3abds2,DylanFloyd,2,Fri Jun 19 01:53:46 2015 UTC,"I have to admit that I think it enhanced it.    One time I was shooting a wedding, and the wedding canopy came down on the bride while her groom was giving her red wine to drink.  It spilled all over her.  The canopy covered her handicapped Father, leaving him alone on a stool, looking like a hyperventilating ghost.  The bride cried her eyes out.  All I could think, while laughing, was that ""these are the events we remember, and in the end even the bride will look back on this fondly and laugh.""  Two years later when I photographed the party celebrating the birth of their child, that's indeed what happened.  Everyone was joking about it.  Some fuckups like these are not tragedies...rather they make the event unique and memorable."

bobdylan,3a9zh9,SurrealistSwimmer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:39:54 2015 UTC,"I have to say, Renaldo & Clara is something that I've very much struggled with over the years. I have seen it a couple of times, even tried the edited version, but felt little joy above that I would feel if I just watched a 'best of' on YouTube.   The primary reason for this, I think, is that the film is so full of references to Dylan's career, the careers and works of people who influenced Dylan and to Dylan's life as a whole, that the only person who seems to have the capacity to fully understand and appreciate the film is possibly only Dylan himself. With anyone else, I'd call an effort like this 'indulgent', but my experience with Bob's other work is that if one puts in the effort of grappling with it, the reward will generally be worth it. For that reason I've always wanted to read the book of interviews Dylan has given about the film, just to at least begin to grasp what he was getting at. Alas, I haven't had the circumstances thus far.   Having said all that, I found your write-up extremely interesting to read and you made some excellent observations that I haven't seen elsewhere. I'm not going to watch the film now, but I already know this is something I will be thinking of when I finally decide to take the plunge to fully appreciate R&C one day. In other words - thank you very much for taking the time to write these thoughts.   By the way, have you seen Masked & Anonymous? Unlike R&C, that's a film I bonded with instantly, so I was curious as to what your thoughts are on that one."

bobdylan,3a9zh9,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Thu Jun 18 22:52:31 2015 UTC,"I'd go with 'I'm Not There squared' or perhaps even 'cubed'. For instance, one gets the reference of the Rimbaud character in I'm Not There. In Renaldo & Clara, that sort of reference would take the shape of a character who only speaks in anagrams based on the journal of Rimbaud's cousin trice removed. If you're not familiar with Rimbaud's cousin and you don't enjoy anagrams, you won't get it.   Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh on R&C here, but a lot of it is deeply self-referential."

bobdylan,3a64vx,DylanFloyd,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:00:21 2015 UTC,"Stumbled across this today. Rotterdam has always been one of my favourite shows from 1978, so to see it on video and (for 1978) in such good detail is a real treat.   Dylan sounds very spirited on the recording and it's good to see that impression seemingly confirmed by this footage.   Also, the little false stop at the end is fantastic to see!   I should stress that this is the reggae version of DTT he did that tour, so it might not be everyone's cup of tea, I suppose."

bobdylan,3a64vx,theveganvulcan,2,Thu Jun 18 15:40:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed, 'Tangled' is great, 'Shelter' is interesting sometimes, and the 'Street Legal' songs are great because they were so rarely played - or not at all - afterwards.    But 'Its Alright Ma' with that arrangement - heresy!"

Been back once or twice since then just to have a look, and it's always pretty deserted barring the odd waiter standing out the back of the Savoy with a cigarette.   It took me a while to find it first time at the Savoy Steps, but it's still really cool, and like a few other Dylan related places in London it's certainly worth a visit."
bobdylan,3a5dca,willington123,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:33:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's an odd one that. We were shooting a video there a while back, so we were pinned to the spot for a whole afternoon.   There's a surprisingly steady traffic of Dylan fans that pass through there (considering how poorly advertised and difficult to find it is), but we haven't seen two groups there at the same time - perhaps one set of people every 20 minutes or so.   The odd thing was that the Savoy staff seemed to have little clue as to why this happens and were quite baffled by it. When we started setting up, a security guard immediately galloped towards us to ask what we were doing there. I explained the reasons and the Dylan connection, to which he, completely startled, answered: ""Is that why all these people come here all the time? Is Bob Dylan really that good?""   Sadly, no one had a CD on them, but I hope the gent found the light eventually..."
bobdylan,3a5dca,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Thu Jun 18 15:37:03 2015 UTC,"Oh well that's good to hear at least, ss - that some Dylan fans still make the effort to go out there - most times I'm in London I like to go to a few Bob places. When I go to see him in October I'll probably pop down to the Savoy Steps again and stop in at the King and Queen for a drink.   Yeah and I agree about the staff there, most of them probably just stand there wondering why people keep coming to have a look at a square of pavement!"

As they are from 1966, and as the next ""50th Anniversary Copyright"" collection is due for 1965, I would like to suggest it will cover 1965/66 from BIABH to BOB with the 66tour as well. In the course of conversations with ""the powers that be"", apparently it will be issued as a double CD, a 5CD De Luxe version with 140 page book and an EXTREMELY limited 18CD version.

bobdylan,3a3220,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Tue Jun 16 23:36:33 2015 UTC,"It's not just the price - which is bound to quite dear, judging by their previous track record - but if it is a de facto 'Copyright Extension Series' release, I expect the physical availability to be quite limited as well (i.e. only a handful of music shops across the world).   Unless there's some truly remarkable undiscovered uncirculated set of gems on the big boy, I'll stick with the 5-CD one."
bobdylan,3a3220,dylanthegrey,4,Wed Jun 17 07:52:03 2015 UTC,"I remember an interview not too long ago with someone involved in compiling the series that said a Blonde on Blonde volume of the Bootleg Series was in the pipeline. So, this could be true.  That said, and this might come off as blasphemy, I hope it isn't. That period has been covered extensively as it is, and I can't imagine there's much left in the vault."
bobdylan,3a3220,apollojl68,3,Tue Jun 16 23:06:08 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I have a feeling there are a lot of studio outtakes that haven't been released yet, or even made it out as unofficial bootlegs (Like the Sad-Eyed Lady outtakes). I bet there are some home demos they can get out too."
bobdylan,3a3220,v1s1onsofjohanna,3,Tue Jun 16 23:24:16 2015 UTC,"Sad Eyed Lady outtakes would certainly be intriguing.  But, I just kinda wish they'd give the 60's a rest for a bit. All of the series except volumes 3, 5, and 8 are from that decade. We all love that period, but it'd be nice to give other eras their due."
bobdylan,3a3220,SurrealistSwimmer,4,Wed Jun 17 01:06:19 2015 UTC,"I would have to agree. It would be great to see some BOTT/Desire outtakes (could you imagine if there's a better live recording of Abandoned Love???) or some live recording from the NET, but this is what will be most profitable while Bobby is still kicking. Not to mention the copyright extension motive."

However, I had my heart set on Vol. 12 being the New York sessions from 74, compiled into how Blood on the Tracks would have sounded before he re-recorded in Minnesota. I love the minimalism of the New York sessions and, compiled, I would probably call it my favorite album."

bobdylan,3a3220,willington123,2,Wed Jun 17 05:25:40 2015 UTC,"There've been rumors for years that the ""next release"" would be focused on the mid 70's, but it keeps getting pushed back (if it was ever really planned).  That's what I'm hoping for too. It'd probably the best chance we'd have to get ""I'm Cold"" and the other reported '77 songs (if it they were ever actually recorded), which is the Dylan Holy Grail in my opinion."
bobdylan,3a3220,SurrealistSwimmer,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:15:25 2015 UTC,"On the bright side, surely after this there won't really be anything left to release from the 60s. I mean, I doubt JWH has scores of unreleased outtakes.   So, really, after this they can presumably leave the 60s alone (unless, of course, they do a DVD BS and start releasing videos) and focus on 70s/gospel/early NET."

Mostly because the British press seemed to have a thing about Donovan being the 'emerging talent' at the time. But aside from that, they seemed pretty friendly with each other."
bobdylan,3a2nw4,willington123,3,Tue Jun 16 19:33:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know.  I thought Donovan came off as really wanting to be pals with Bob and Bob kind of brushing him off.  The way Bob seems to direct ""It's all Over Now, Baby Blue"" to Donovan seems particularly pointed to me"
bobdylan,3a2nw4,Thelonious_Cube,3,Tue Jun 16 20:35:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah quite possibly, though to me Donovan looked more happy to be there, rather then actually being there for any particular reason - he struck me as a bit sycophantic, but maybe that's a little harsh.  And someone pointed out to me a couple of weeks ago on here that Donovan actually asks Bob to play 'baby blue', so it's not just Bob wanting to show Donovan up. Though of course he does just by playing the song in comparison."
bobdylan,3a2nw4,willington123,2,Tue Jun 16 21:19:31 2015 UTC,"I thought he just asked him to play something and Bob chose ""Baby Blue"" - I could be mis-remembering that, though"

The papers crescendoed  him Englands dylan, or something to that effect, which is funny as dylan had always been bigger over seas. It was also a lot to put on a young donovan.   The first time they met donovan, dylan and I think it was Manuel, wore masks and were snarly to him. They hung out at newport. It was just harsh banter at the expanses of donovan."

bobdylan,3a2nw4,DylanFloyd,3,Tue Jun 16 21:22:54 2015 UTC,"At that point in England, Donovan was being heralded as the new Bob Dylan. Donovan dressed like him and was singing the same sort of folky protest tunes that Dylan. And because of Dylan's increasingly post-modern and esoteric lyrics, a lot of his fans (especially in England) were flocking to Donovan's camp.  Dylan, being a normal 24 year old, didn't take very kindly to some rip-off trying to bite his style. Especially in that hotel scene, where it's mostly Donovan's friends hanging out, tensions were a bit high when Donovan plays his song. There seemed to be a sense of satisfaction from his buddies, as if he had proven that he had taken Dylan's throne. But then Dylan plays his song (""Baby Blue""), albeit in a drunken, slightly vitriolic manner, and crushes him artistically, looking right at him most of the time. Donovan's reaction is priceless. He knows he just got trumped and has this grin-and-bear-it sort of expression on."

bobdylan,39wu6k,Odnoen,3,Mon Jun 15 13:39:44 2015 UTC,This is one of my favorite scenes ever! It's so ridiculous. He's obviously high/drunk. I think he was mad that somebody might have littered in the street. Someone who was apart of his crew.
bobdylan,39wu6k,bamberjean,2,Mon Jun 15 15:13:14 2015 UTC,"I really like donovan, who offers to help clean up the glass. In doing this everyone stops and looks at him. Like there is about to be a fight, and they just look at donovan who at that point realizes he should have not said a word and looks at his feet.   I always felt bad for donovan in this scene as funny as this scene was.   Also, it was not really littering, they show how high his room was, they the glass shelves he had and tossed it out the window. They should not have been where they were, and they could have hurt some one and no one was particularly happy about that party."
bobdylan,39wu6k,CatMadeOfFur,3,Mon Jun 15 23:27:27 2015 UTC,"Its not just that, later in the scene when they're kind of making up before he starts playing his guitar, he just says ""I didn't want anyone to get hurt man.""

bobdylan,39ksms,litewo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:16:27 2015 UTC,Apparently Paul Simon has something of a small hatred for Dylan (at least as a musician). Paul has always been compared to Dylan and always gets put second in that comparison. He talks about it in this article.

bobdylan,39ks6h,throe,4,Fri Jun 12 12:32:50 2015 UTC,"That is kind of a good point. Considering the size and general dedication of the Dylan community, it is quite surprising there hasn't been an attempt to catalogue all that enthusiasm and knowledge and put it under one roof.   I mean, there are lots of niche sites - dylachords for the guitar stuff, stubs for the photos (now seemingly defunct), bobsboots for the commercial bootlegs, hisbobness for historical concerts, boblinks for set lists etc. - but there's nothing to tie it all together. ER, really, is the place where one would generally search for trivia and detailed info, but that's a forum and very cumbersome as an encyclopaedia.   Wikipedia's input on Bob is somewhat decent, but developing that runs the risk of the Wikipedia admins deeming the content to be too granular. A dedicated platform makes sense and it could then serve as a hub for the wider Dylan web.   My only concern with an open source project is the prospect of the slightly more... esoteric... fans making outlandish edits, e.g. ""Like A Rolling Stone is Dylan's zionist call for extermination of African Americans and pandas"" (and, unfortunately, there are people like that), which could be difficult to police on an open source platform. Then again, there is nothing stopping one from allowing intra-article 'polemic', i.e. offering alternative points of view on a particular issue/song/event (I'm already fantasising about what the 'Gospel Years' section would look like).   The other concern is copyright: what would the wiki's host attitude be towards bootleg discussion and illustrative videos? What about photos, lyrics etc.? It would be a shame putting all that effort into a good wiki for it to be then shut down by an over-zealous host."
bobdylan,39ks6h,SurrealistSwimmer,4,Fri Jun 12 19:49:44 2015 UTC,I would imagine if someone (we?) took the initativ and got it going it would prosper and grow in a very short period of time. I just love the idea of someone getting into Dylan and having a catalouge of information/anecdotes/interviews on each specific concert/song/album/lyric.
bobdylan,39ks6h,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Fri Jun 12 19:56:24 2015 UTC,"Indeed, a resource like that would be absolutely invaluable, not just for new fans but also for long-term fans, I reckon. After all, I think many of us still discover gems despite years of listening to Dylan.   I have to admit, my biographical knowledge of Dylan's life is very rudimentary - I only read what I need to to appreciate the music a bit more - but I'm happy to help with what I can.   Perhaps one approach is to get a few enthusiastic people on board and come up with a basic structure for the wiki and fill up the relevant stubs and also to make sure content stays up to date.   For instance, from a core article about Dylan, a visitor could then explore a year further. Within a year, one can then click through to a detailed list of shows, from which one then can view more details about a particular show: set list, notable performances, comments from Dylan/audience etc. Same approach with albums, songs etc. as well as biographical details of note.   Of course, there would be parallel strands, e.g. for Dylan's interviews, instruments etc. Naturally, one would have to spend a good deal of time working this structure out, as there's a lot of possible strands to consider.   Once this basic structure is in place, one could then do a wider 'publicity push', on ER and elsewhere, to get the wider community involved and to introduce detail, nuance and better sourcing of the articles.   Getting the goodwill and/or cooperation of folks like Olof from bjorner.com, Les Kokay, the folks from the Lossless Bob project and so forth could provide a good layer of depth for the more 'seasoned' fan. One could even do more fanciful things, e.g. if the hisbobness folks have an API or are open to collaboration, we could use that, add the data from boblinks and present the hisbobness data in an up-to-date (and less iframe-ey) manner. In this way you could quickly and easily check when a particular song was last performed, how often it's performed etc. (although I do realise I'm getting way ahead of myself).   The thing about the above approach is that whilst it is organised, it is a top-down approach with wider input coming in late. An alternative way of doing it is a 'startup approach', which would imply first consulting a wider base of people on how to do the site and then building it based on that sort of 'market research' and public consensus. The downside with the latter way, however, is that it is difficult to drum up interest in a project that doesn't exist (and the Dylan community, I find, can be quite cynical).   Something to think about, anyway.   The other thing to consider is perhaps getting someone with IT skills on board for CSS and back-end management. For instance, it would be great to implement Google Analytics to monitor traffic through the wiki, which would then allow the admins to see whether a particular structure is working or not and do A/B tests to ensure the best visitor experience. Wikia has a custom analytics system built in, so perhaps that's good enough, but there also may be other alternatives to Wikia.   At any rate, enough rambling - I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's an interesting project and if we can get a few people on board, I'm happy to help in whichever way I can."
bobdylan,39ks6h,sonnezlacloche,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:39:23 2015 UTC,I find that the actual wikipedia pages for Dylan's songs and albums are quite extensive in themselves. I think a dedicated wiki would be redundant.

'65 to me reeks  uncertainty, particularly the US dates (the UK is, of course, another story, but I never quite got on with it, for whatever reason), whilst '63 is just a little too preachy for my tastes. '64 strikes a nice balance of confidence, good material and that little hint of detached cynicism which I so enjoy with mid-60s Dylan."

Dylan sounds fresh, relaxed, urgent and so present. It's also a huge mistake that he left this off of ""Desire"" and replaced it with the craptacular ""Joey."""
bobdylan,39c0ll,SurrealistSwimmer,3,Wed Jun 10 21:40:39 2015 UTC,"I still can't quite grasp the general hate for Joey. Sure, there are better tunes than that on the album and I prefer the unreleased alternate take to the album one, but I still feel it fits better on the album than the somewhat absent-minded studio version of Abandoned Love (the above live take, of course, is a completely different story).   And, as far as album outliers go, I still reckon it ranks far above the likes of New Pony on Street-Legal or Meet Me In The Morning on BOTT.   And yet, poor old Joey is usually met with almost universal derision. Can anyone help me understand why?"
bobdylan,39c0ll,ThinWildMercury1,2,Thu Jun 11 11:53:53 2015 UTC,I agree!
bobdylan,39c0ll,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Thu Jun 11 14:16:09 2015 UTC,"Ever heard the alternate take? The intro is a bit odd, fair enough, but overall I find it's got a whole lot more spirit to it than the actual album version. Not exactly sure why they didn't go for that one."
bobdylan,39c0ll,RichHixson,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:05:53 2015 UTC,"The great Lester Bangs makes a case against ""Joey"" far better than I ever could. Here's his article.  In a nutshell. The song monotonously drags on and on for something close to 11 minutes with no life to it and the lyrics are all crap (i.e. absolute lies).  Joey murdered at least two men, beat his wife in front of his children (once breaking her ribs), was a diagnosed psychopath and committed numerous felonies as well as bragged about raping a guy in prison while holding a knife to his throat."
bobdylan,39c0ll,SurrealistSwimmer,3,Thu Jun 11 15:43:50 2015 UTC,"See, this is the thing: what the real-life Joey Gallo did has, in my mind, nothing to do with whatever Dylan (or Levy, in this case) does with the story.   Dylan has always done this. Do you think his depiction of Rubin Carter's life is accurate? Or that of William Zantzinger? Or, for that matter, do you believe men like John Wesley Hardin, Billy the Kid or Jesse James deserve elevation and adulation?   Dylan has always taken a pinch of reality to create a mythology, to make a point or at least to spin a good yarn. At the same time, Dylan was always fascinated with rather naked violence - themes that run all the way from Freewheelin' to Tempest. Joey, in this respect, is thematically no different to any other Dylan song.   What makes people sore, I suppose, is that his story was too recent and it couldn't be made as ambiguous as Hurricane or his side couldn't be as easily sold as with Hattie Carroll. People get so lost in reality that they forget to listen to the song, which is decidedly fantasy.   Just look at any other song on Desire (and, in fact, this is the reason why I always argue against the inclusion of Abandoned Love): they're all outlandish tales of outlaws who lived outside the regular boundaries of our lives. Hurricane, Isis, Coffee, Joey, Durango etc. They are all myths, all symbols. The only song vaguely connected to reality is Sara and even that is a myth - the myth of Dylan's own muse.   In this respect, Abandoned Love has no place on Desire (unless it replaces the, in my mind, superior Sara) but Joey most decidedly has.   Musically, yes, it is a bit meandering and I strongly prefer the unreleased take I posted above. But, as I said earlier, I don't think it is anywhere near as meandering as New Pony, Meet Me In The Morning, Pledging My Time, Obviously 5 Believers, Rollin' and Tumblin' and so forth. Is it a great song? No, not in a million years. Is it a bad song? No, not in a million years either. It's an average song and the hate it gets, from what I understand, stems more from the fact that people expect Dylan to be a historian rather than a story-teller."

bobdylan,395oko,jelly_head,2,Tue Jun 9 23:36:36 2015 UTC,"I've long held that Street Legal is Bob's response to punk rock. I seem to remember reading once (can't find it now) that Bob met the Clash after a show in around 78; as I recall Mick said Bob liked Mick's leather jacket and asked where he got it, then Bob went to Camden Market or wherever the next day and bought one in every color."

Can anyone tell me the allure behind this bootleg?"
bobdylan,395brz,pageplantzoso,2,Tue Jun 9 13:55:06 2015 UTC,"Ah cool, not a problem, man. And I think, aside from the odd soundboard recording, most of the recordings of the concerts are from the audience, so if you think these are mid 60s personal tape recorders being used, nothing too technical, then it's understandable that most of the recordings are quite bad.  From the concert recordings of the soundboards you can hear how great Bob and the band are, so it's certainly not a problem with the performers, just the basic technology being used to record it.   As for the allure, for me personally, it's that the '66 world tour was so (in)famous, with Bob seemingly floating on a cloud of amphetamine through the tour, barely held together, yet delivering incredible performances against a baying and belligerent crowd. Also, for posterities sake it's nice to have something complete."

All you would have to do is:    right click on a folder go down to 'send to' then click on 'Compressed (zipped) folder'.   Then you can just upload the zip files themselves to the website, and people can download entire discs instead of individual tracks. You might have to find a different file sharing website to upload them from (Sendshare only allows for 300MB file uploads), I would suggest using Dropbox.

Here are my very initial thoughts on 1-25-76:  Masterpiece - wow, Bob is very hoarse!  Otherwise sounds more or less like a '75 show  Maggie's Farm - I guess the Masterpiece was just a warm up, he sounds full of energy and indeed the arrangement is a mostly-there 1976 one, without the stops and starts.  Quite nice, too bad the sound quality is so low.  One Too Many Mornings - love it.  4th Street - very interesting, I never heard this arrangement before.  The lack of 'Blood on the Tracks' songs is surprising given their prominence on both the '75 and '76 tour.  Hurricane - sounds very rushed and Bob sounds a bit uncomfortable."

The 1965 Free Trade Hall show is a good one for acoustic '65 performances, they weren't calling him Judas either.  His '66 performaces in Australia are great, check out Melbourne for instance."

That's in the ""British Judas Concerts"" bootleg that the OP mentioned, if you wanted to check it out. I don't know if there's a recording of the entire concert. The Judas Concerts only has a few songs from that date.  The entire dialogue before Like A Rolling Stone is this:  ""I never done this before but I want you to meet Robbie Robertson here, and Garth Hudson, Mickey Jones, Rick Danko, and uh... and Richard. [quietly, as if to the band] You promised me you were gonna leave. [Back to audience] It doesn't mean a thing, you know I mean you don't have to... but they're... they're all poets, understand? Uhhhh... if it comes out that way, it comes out that way, but... all the gr- all poets, you know. This song here is dedicated to the Taj Mahal. Now we're gonna leave after this song and I want to say goodbye to all of you people, you've been very wo- great people. Uh... you know, I l- well. You've been very nice people. I mean here you are sitting in this great huge place. And believe me we've enjoyed every minute of being here [sarcastically, as some of the audience boos].""

Some of the audio quality of these recordings (especially the Forest Hills concert) are abysmal yet essential.   I would also add one of the sets covering his '65 BBC appearance, such as At The Beeb.  1965 was a transitional year for Dylan and at least to me can be a bit rough around the edges. By '66 the fire was burning brightly. The Jewels and Binocular 26 CD set is as exciting as it is essential."

bobdylan,38ao5m,SurrealistSwimmer,3,Wed Jun 3 09:58:16 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea. I have always liked the musicians who were the most experimental (bar drums, which ought to be steady), so I'd love to hear the noise this mish-mash grouping would make:   Drums - Receli (current NET band, drumming since 2002)  Bass - Stoner (Rolling Thunder Revue #1 and #2 and Japan leg of '78 tour - 1975-1978)  Guitar - GE Smith (band leader and guitarist during early NET - 1988-1991)  Guitar/Violin/Miscellaneous - Larry Campbell (with the NET band 1999-2002, seen in Masked & Anonymous)    EDIT: Added eras, as per /u/Grizzlyhorse's rather sensible request."
bobdylan,38ao5m,DylanFloyd,2,Wed Jun 3 09:35:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with this although I might substitute Tony Garnier (1989-present) on bass for Stoner.  That being said, putting Garnier in would make the band dangerously close to being the band he actually toured with from 2002 or so forward.  I suppose Stoner would make things more interesting and give him a 2nd backup singer along with Campbell.  I guess it depends on the sound he is going for.  For the ""garage band"" sound I love the 1988 ensemble of Smith (guitar), Aaranson (bass), Parker (drums).  For the more majestic and complex arrangements I like the 2001-2002 group of Campbell (guitar/steel/violin/mandolin), Sexton (guitar), Garnier (bass), and Receli or Kemper (drums).  Sexton later rejoined the group and Garnier of course has played with him since 1989."
bobdylan,38ao5m,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Wed Jun 3 13:47:38 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I was toying with putting in Tony instead of Stoner but I figured that would be a bit too... conservative, I suppose. The niggle I have with Stoner is that he so frequently seemed to want to 'outperform' Dylan, something Tony never does.   It also hugely depends on which Dylan one would have with this band - the above band would probably drive current Dylan insane, so I was thinking of pairing it with '88 Bob (EDIT: this almost sounds like on of those 'Wine & Cheese' evenings...).   In terms of the bands he actually had, I would absolutely agree with you: those two bands are by far my two favourite Dylan backing groups (well, consistent ones - see '84 Letterman for 'what could have been'), but I do think that we'll give the current band a lot of credit as well, once it becomes consigned to history. It's not the most progressive of ensembles, but for what they are trying to achieve, I think they're brilliant."

Dylan's role as producer has basically been to assemble the musicians and give general guidelines about how he wants the studio set up (or rather what he doesn't want)."

bobdylan,37zfs2,bizzycarl,3,Mon Jun 1 12:38:18 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you that folks get hung up on the lyrics and frequently miss the greatest aspects of his art. (Personally for me it's the chord changes). But I have to slightly throw a little water on your concepts of Producer Bob. Everything I've read has led me to believe he works super fast, doesn't want to get bogged down in engineering details, and that it's the MUSICIANS he works with, not studio expertise that provides the stunning sound.   I am quite sure that his 50 years of studio time is invaluable,  but I just don't see him geeking out about reverbs, eq settings, etc. That band, however? Total sonic artists. The best guitars, the best amplifiers,  and of course the best technique. They were hired BECAUSE they sound like an old record, dig?  And yes...Time Out of Mind stoned is killer! But remember: that's the work of Daniel Lanois,  and I highly suggest anything he's produced...especially Emmylou Harris' Red Dirt Girl."
bobdylan,37zfs2,nn_nn,1 point,Sun May 31 19:36:32 2015 UTC,"Lanois co-produced with Dylan, I didn't mean to overlook his work but we shouldn't overlook Dylan.  And saying that Dylan just gathered the musicians is like dismissing a director's work, saying he just gathered everyone there and they did all the work. Of course he surrounds himself with great artists, engineers, musicians, etc. Saying someone produced something isn't trying to take away from the other work everyone else did but at the end of the day, they're the producer.   I see everywhere that his role is downplayed when people describe it and shit but I bet you the dude is meticulously interested with his sound. People try to make it seem like he just walks into a studio, plays, and walks out, no thought even, just pure energy. But I'm sure there are ideas he has about his work we can't even begin to know.  If a team wins a championship, you also gotta credit the coach, don't you?"
bobdylan,37zfs2,nostrilz,2,Sun May 31 21:05:34 2015 UTC,"I haven't got much to add, just wanted to say that if you want to hear the production value on Love and Theft, listen 'Bye and Bye'."
bobdylan,37zfs2,nostrilz,2,Sun May 31 19:26:52 2015 UTC,"Absolutely true, friend. Haven't heard this in years until you just wrote it. Holy shit!"
bobdylan,37zfs2,62Silvertone,2,Sun May 31 21:06:26 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with you, and I think his rise as producer roughly seems to coincide with his decline as a guitar player, which makes sense. He lost the ability to use a trusty old tool, so he picked up another one in its place.  I generally like his production style, especially on Love and Theft. However, I hope he lets someone else produce him again eventually, to get nudged outside of his comfort zone to see what happens.   For example, Dylan didn't like Daniel Lanois' production on Time Out of Mind, but I think it mixed amazingly well with his songs. Maybe we'll get another bit of serendipity like that again some day, but you can never predict that."
bobdylan,37zfs2,Mrgreen428,2,Mon Jun 1 15:08:26 2015 UTC,"I can totally agree with that. All I wanted to do was give props to the dude's production because a song a lot of the time is more a product of a producer than of the actual people playing. At least, musically the ideas are (most of the time) theirs. If you hear a song live, yeah, that's the band.   I think Bob is one of the most interesting record producers out there, that's all I was saying. I'd be interested to hear what someone else can do with his records, too.  I'd also love to hear Bob produce someone else's record. Don't know who that would be, though.  Maybe Alicia Keys?"
bobdylan,37zfs2,DylanFloyd,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:16:34 2015 UTC,"True, it'd be interesting to hear him produce an R&B singer like that, or someone else completely outside of his genre. A Dylan-produced metal album would probably have some redeeming qualities."
bobdylan,37zfs2,FizzPig,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:20:46 2015 UTC,"As a producer/engineer, Dylan has made some of the best sounding records I've heard over the last 15 years. Modern Times isn't a sonic masterpiece, but the arrangements are great. Dylan captures a very classic sound. I'm pretty sure he's still tracking to tape. It sounds great. Love and Theft is one of his best records, hands down."
bobdylan,37yjo9,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Sun May 31 14:11:19 2015 UTC,"I kinda wish Bob had played Woodstock, was so much more iconic than IoW and can you imagine the kind of reaction he would've got?  Would've been on a whole new level"
bobdylan,37yjo9,ThinWildMercury1,2,Sun May 31 15:06:07 2015 UTC,"See, I find that difficult to imagine. I mean, can you picture Dylan coming on after all the psychedelia, counter-culture etc. in his white suit, mellowly chiming Lay Lady Lay? Considering what the build-up would've been, I wouldn't be surprised if the audience reaction would've been quite hostile.   It just wasn't his scene at the time - Woodstock was for the Hendrixes and Jefferson Airplanes, so I can see why he wouldn't want to do that and instead opted for something s far away from there as possible.   Now, if Woodstock happened in 1971, when he seemed to be in a completely different groove, I think that could've really been something special."
bobdylan,37yjo9,ThinWildMercury1,2,Sun May 31 23:30:29 2015 UTC,"can you picture Dylan coming on after all the psychedelia, counter-culture etc. in his white suit, mellowly chiming Lay Lady Lay?    Sure, Woodstock was far more of a psychedelic rock/hippy counter culture scene, but so was the IoW crowd really- and to both these sets of fans Dylan was god, I reckon they'd have been blown away by any Dylan appearance.   can you picture Dylan coming on after all the psychedelia, counter-culture etc. in his white suit, mellowly chiming Lay Lady Lay?    Sure the Airplane and Hendrix were there, but Arlo Guthrie, Joan Baez, Richie Havens and even The Band themselves all played to a great reception, so I'm fairly sure Dylan, like the next level up from all of them, would have been much the same and probably even better given he'd barely performed since '66.  That 1971 recording is awesome! How have I never heard it before?  What was the event for him to be playing live at that time?  I was only really aware of The Concert for Bangladesh in terms of live Dylan in 1971."
bobdylan,37yjo9,TeddyPickNPin,1 point,Sun May 31 23:43:51 2015 UTC,"Same here. It's insane how much ""secret"" stuff there is with Dylan. I though he was pretty reclusive besides studio work until 73 or so."
bobdylan,37yjo9,nutt_butter_baseball,2,Wed Jun 3 19:05:55 2015 UTC,So in today's dollars he got paid about $900000 for an hour long concert. Woah.
bobdylan,37x0rl,IDOWNVOTECATSONSIGHT,9,Sun May 31 02:43:54 2015 UTC,"I think Martin Carthy perhaps put it best when he said that Bob was 'an ordinary guy with an extraordinary talent'. He is of course just a regular guy, with a family, a house, he watches the same tv shows, and I'm sure reads the same books as some people.   Though I think Bob is just much more introverted, he likes making music and loves writing songs - and then at some point in the 1960s he became 'the spokesperson for a generation', he became, for a period of 3 or 4 years, under a period of intense scrutiny with photographers following him, film crews following him and journalists looking to turn every little thing he said into the next grand statement. Hence why he played around with journalists so much during the tours of '65 and '66, I don't think he was being hostile in his answers, he was just giving answers that equaled the quality of the questions - I mean, how is a 24 year old guy supposed to be the spokesman for a generation, and answer questions on behalf of a generation when he's had this title thrust upon him. I'm sure I'd be much more hostile that Bobby ever was.  As for the early years, well, Bob wasn't exactly from a rich family but he was from a family with money - I'm of the understanding that they did send money from time to time in the early years, he stayed with friends in Dinkytown at UoM, and had his own places like any student. The early NY days, he couch surfed a lot - see Iniside Llewyn Davis - and then got a place before he met Suze, then they had a place afterwards. And I guess before he got famous he paid for this through the same ways we all have/will, cobbling together what little money we have etc.  Bob was always close to his parents I think, and they were well aware of his wanting to go to NY. The way I see it is that 'Bob Dylan' became Bobby Zimmerman's persona in the early years - this travelling hobo with neglectful parents, who travelled with the circus and made it in New York - then when the truth came out, it was merely just Bob reinventing himself. He left Minnesota and became Bob Dylan and adopted a new name and a new persona.  I'll stop rambling now - but Bob is known to have a killer sense of humour, he's known to be loyal to some friends, and perhaps less so to others, like all of us. And that's it really,  Bob is you and me, and himself, whoever that is."

bobdylan,37x0rl,Nogbadd,6,Mon Jun 1 00:17:50 2015 UTC,"There can few other figures in the twentieth century who defy categorisation to the same extent as his Bobness. The Queen of England has never given an interview, while Dylan has given numerous interviews, but I think we can more certain of what sort of person Lizbet is than what sort of person the artist formerly known as Robert Zimmerman is.   This elusive character has spawned countless books, articles, essays and blog posts attempting to answer the questions:   ""who is Bob Dylan""? what do his songs mean? what is going on in his head?   Answers to some of the contextual questions that you have asked can be found in those sources. ""Did he ever talk to the crowds during his concerts?"" ""I don't believe you! You're a liar!"" answers that one. My favourite is ""...that's straight from Chicago....this is from the Mohave Desert!""  I'm not sure why you are using the past tense, as I'm not aware that he has passed on, but I certainly agree with the labels ""mystery"" and ""enigma"" ;-)"

bobdylan,37x0rl,unfitfuzzball,3,Mon Jun 1 00:17:22 2015 UTC,"In 'No Direction Home' Liam Clancy describes Bob as a shape shifter, which I think is an apt description.  This guy can change his entire demeanor and way he presents himself in a way I don't think anyone else I know of can.  Even in the 4 years from '62 to 66 he changed from a scruffy folk singer playing woody guthrie songs in NYC folk clubs, to the coolest rock star on the planet basically setting the entire genres standards, and that's only a small fraction of his career/life.    To answer some of your questions, yes he did speak to his parents- his mum even joined him on stage during the 1975 leg of the Rolling Thunder Revue (see the woman on the left here)  Yes he does speak to the audience, basically his entire career till about maybe 2004, he would speak a lot to the audience.  If you get the 1964 Carnegie Hall concert bootleg series half of greatness of that show is him talking with the audience, he cracks them up between most songs. He still sometimes does talk with the audience, see here for instance.  Anyway, I don't think we'll ever really know what Bob's really thinking and when he's being sincere or having us on, but maybe that's part of his appeal, you can never pin him down, he's constantly unpredictable.    This is my take at least, I'm sure others have very different and no less legitimate opinions."

That same resourcefulness meant he could figure out how to just get by in the meantime. Then when it took off, he got real big, real fast, and he's had to deal with the trappings of that kind of fame ever since.   It's kind of a like a Michael Jackson thing where he's a little weird to start with because that went hand in hand with what made him special, but then when he got famous he got even weirder because of only being surrounded by yes men all the time."

I think he really likes his privacy, but not having information about him only fuels our fires to find out more.  Really strange duality.  But at the same time, I think he uses this to manipulate his image, he enjoys throwing us off.

bobdylan,37w1og,moonshiners,2,Sat May 30 22:38:04 2015 UTC,"Apparently Bob Dylan hadn't even planned on doing an electric set - the wikipedia page says he decided earlier in the day that he would perform with a band. The decision came about not because Dylan wanted to experiment or test his sound, but because one of the organizing members of the Newport Festival had apparently made some disparaging remarks about the Paul Butterfield Blues Band to the audience when they performed (without Dylan) on the opening night of the festival. It was a last minute thing, and Dylan meant it as a 'fuck you' to the organizer."
bobdylan,37w1og,autowikibot,1 point,Sat May 30 23:57:54 2015 UTC,"Section 1. Newport 1965 set of article  Electric Dylan controversy:       At the 1963 Newport Folk Festival, Dylan had been received enthusiastically when he performed ""Blowin' in the Wind"" with Joan Baez, Peter Paul and Mary, and other Festival performers.  At the 1964 Newport Folk Festival, Dylan performed ""With God On Our Side"" and ""Mr Tambourine Man"".   On Saturday, July 24, 1965, Dylan performed three acoustic numbers, ""All I Really Want to Do"", ""If You Gotta Go, Go Now"", and ""Love Minus Zero/No Limit"" at a Newport workshop.  According to Jonathan Taplin, a roadie at Newport (and later a road manager for the acts of Dylan's manager Albert Grossman) Dylan made a spontaneous decision on the Saturday that he would challenge the Festival by performing with a fully amplified band. Taplin said that Dylan had been irritated by what he considered condescending remarks which festival organiser Alan Lomax had made about the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, when Lomax introduced them for an earlier set at a festival workshop. Dylan's attitude, according to Taplin, was, ""Well, fuck them if they think they can keep electricity out of here, I'll do it. On a whim he said he wanted to play electric.""  Dylan then assembled a band and rehearsed that night at a mansion being used by festival organiser George Wein.  On the night of Sunday, July 25, Dylan's appearance was sandwiched between Cousin Emmy and the Sea Island singers, two decidedly traditional acts.  The band that went on stage to back Dylan included two musicians who had played on his recently released single, ""Like a Rolling Stone"": Mike Bloomfield on lead guitar and Al Kooper on organ. Two of Bloomfield's bandmates from the Paul Butterfield Blues Band also appeared at Newport: bassist Jerome Arnold and drummer Sam Lay, along with Barry Goldberg on piano.

bobdylan,37k3m8,SurrealistSwimmer,7,Thu May 28 13:47:56 2015 UTC,"Wonderful post and a great coupling. Frankly, I don't think I can top that, however long I think about it, but there are two songs that always struck me as a couple: Shelter From The Storm and Up To Me.   Musically they're almost twins and I suppose that was one of the main reasons why Up To Me was left out of Blood On The Tracks. But I don't think the musical similarities are a coincidence (despite the fact that there are only so many tunes one can play in an open E tuning before it all starts sounding similar). I do think that Up To Me is a follow-up of Shelter, perhaps seen from a few days later or months or years.   Shelter tells the tale of a man rescued and subsequently stranded by a passionate night with a woman (at least that's how I see it). Up To Me finds him still unable to let go.   The alternate take of Shelter hints at the future that is to come: ""It's a never-ending battle for a peace that's always torn, come in..."". The very first verse of Up To Me references a struggle, a battle of sorts. He's still fighting for his peace, even though the woman is now seemingly all but lost.   There are more relations. Shelter: ""Now the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount / but nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts"". Up To Me: ""We heard the Sermon on the Mount and I knew it was too complex / It didin't amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects"". This line strikes me as very similar to the ""staying up for days, writing Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands for you"" in terms one song (or the events from one song) being referenced in another.   The other one that foreshadows the future is from Shelter: ""Well I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line / beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine"". In Up To Me, he reaches that line: ""Well, I just can't rest without you, love, I need your company / But you ain't a-gonna cross the line, I guess it must be up to me"".   And so on and so on. I probably could spend all day writing about these two, but the point remains: I think these two songs are meant to be two sides of the same coin and were written as a tandem. As such, whilst nowhere near as poignant as the Sad Eyed Lady / Sara couplet, I think they stand out as a very unique effort in Dylan's catalogue."

bobdylan,37k3m8,SurrealistSwimmer,4,Tue Jun 16 12:41:52 2015 UTC,"Ive always thought boots of spanish leather and simple twist of fate were intimately linked, despite being written over a decade apart and presumably about different women.   In each song the singer is attempting to distance himself emotionally from a woman who left him and went overseas and who sent him a note or letter that broke his heart.  In boots, all he wants today and tomorrow is her sweet kiss and (unspoiled) return home. But when he gets a letter from her saying she has no immediate plans to return, he drops all that and asks simply for a nice set of boots. He's moved on.  In simple we get a more intimate and mature portrait of what ""moving on"" looks like. He again gets a note ending the relationship, and again tells himself he doesn't care. He pushes back the blinds and tries to greet a new day, but theres an emptiness inside. Her leaving hurts so bad it should be a crime. So much for moving on - our singer is down at the docks with the sailors hoping to find her again.   I've been looking for a coda to this story in Dylan's work, but if it's there I haven't found it yet."
bobdylan,37k3m8,nostrilz,3,Thu May 28 17:04:51 2015 UTC,"Haven't really thought of this before, but reading your comment: Not Dark Yet perhaps?   ""She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind / She put down in writing what was in her mind / I just don't see why I should even care / It's not dark yet, but it's getting there""   Perhaps the coda is a man who has gone through so many of these heart-breaks that he just became numb from it. Hardly a happy tale though."
bobdylan,37k3m8,willington123,2,Thu May 28 17:18:31 2015 UTC,Call Letter Blues is about a man struggling with having just been left by a woman.

bobdylan,37k3m8,moonshiners,3,Thu May 28 18:32:43 2015 UTC,"Okay so I'm going to cheat a little bit but I'm going for three songs, and in my opinion three of Bobby's best - 'Girl From the North Country', 'Don't Think Twice it's Alright' and 'Boots of Spanish Leather'.   Although lyrically there isn't perhaps too much in common, meaning that I can't quote lyrics that are particularly similar, BUT the subject matter and the lady in question brings them together somewhat.  I think these songs, although not a part of Bob's abstract songwriting - ie perhaps the songs considered to be his best - are still pretty incredible. They show a youthful, adolescence and an insight into relationships that I think can only be experienced at a certain age, especially in comparison to the type of songs that would make up Blood on the tracks.  Of course, Suze Rotolo is the lady in question of the latter two songs with Bob putting into song his feelings while she was away in Italy - in pretty breathtaking and beautiful prose. The first song however, Girl From the North Country, may not be his best, but I think it'll always be my favourite - although of course, the girl in question differs and it's debatable as to whom the Girl From the North Country is - Echo or Bonnie Beecher, after reading Toby Thompson's excellent Dylan book, I'd plum for the former!"
bobdylan,37k3m8,DylanFloyd,3,Thu May 28 21:17:38 2015 UTC,"This is also a little cheating but I love it how he makes these references to old time folk characters. He talks about the roving gambler in Highway 61, gypsy davy in Tombstone blues... If you listen to the songs he was listening there is so much more magic to discover in his lyrics. Something else, if you listen to Tin Angel on tempest, you recognise the story from the folksong black jack (or gypsy) Davey, the song by Dylan is way more detailed and cruel than the original folk song, different ending but definitly about the same characters. He did the same thing with scarlet town and Barbara Allen."

He went to see a jazzsinger in a café in New Orleans and something about the voice of this jazzsinger triggered him to make anew album then and there. New voice, instruments... He invited Daniel Lanois (whom also worked with him on Time out of mind) to help him produce the record. There was this atmosphere in New Orleans he wanted to capture in his songs, the misty foggy streets at twilight... He told he best captured that feeling in Man in the long black coat. He already recorded some songs, one with a saxophone player (Where teardrops fall). The saxophoneplayer never said a word to Dylan and just sat there in the studio in a corner wearing a long black coat. That inspired him to write the song."

bobdylan,37k3m8,sartorissnopes,1 point,Fri May 29 14:12:18 2015 UTC,"Man in the long black coat is an excellent song, it has such a eerie and desolate vibe, which is why I've always thought he was referring to death.

bobdylan,37k3m8,LowlandLightening,3,Fri May 29 22:35:07 2015 UTC,"Girl From the North Country and If You See Her, Say Hello -- both songs look back with a sort of grief on something that's passed, both are about people trying to pretend like they don't really care (and in the process revealing that they do), and both are phrased as a note to a friend freer than the narrator -- but then turn into a love letter to a woman who is more memory than person.   I always think of Girl From the North Country as February, and If You See Her, Say Hello as August.  In both, the girl is far away both geographically and time-wise, and Bob can't quite kill his love -- no matter how hard he tries."
bobdylan,37k3m8,SurrealistSwimmer,3,Fri May 29 02:11:32 2015 UTC,"""The Times They Are-A Changin"" and ""Things Have Changed"".  A young man's certainty and idealism for change versus an old man's end-of-the-world type recognition that the times are always strange, nothing he can do about it.    I don't think the two songs are specifically connected by Bob. They are just two good songs that deal with the same topic from two perspectives.   Bob was in his 20s for ""The Times They Are-A Changin"" which has a voice speaking to and for many other people. He was close to 60 for ""Things Have Changed"" and it revolves around the narrator only, and a shrug of the shoulders to the chaos that changes around him."

When else do we know of him staying up for days, writing a song in mad passion for someone? It was the genesis of their relationship.

Apparently Spider John brought home a vinyl of Dave Van Ronk from a festival and Bob up and left for NYC saying he had to meet him. I'd sit and pick spider John's brain about folk music and the old days when Dylan was just a kid starting out. It was amazing.

It's never been among my favorites, though: I've always felt it isn't lyrically sophisticated, some of the songs do nothing for me and have the feel of filler, and there isn't much there that a listener could ONLY get from Bob Dylan. It sounds terrific, though: I remember seeing Silver Linings Playbook in the cinema and being blown away by the sequence which used Girl from the North Country. My opinion has been that for most other acts, it would be a seminal album; but for Dylan, it's middle of the road, at best."

That would become a problem with a lot of his records in the 1980's.    He left off some great songs, which later surfaced on The Bootleg Series Vol. 1-3, while including mediocre ones which dragged the album down a bit (Trouble; Dead Man). The production also could've been better and he could've used better takes for some of the songs.    So all in all, I would say the material was there and there was a possibility to create a great album, but due to some bad decisions it became less than it could've been.

She knows this car would go out of control""  “We’re going all the way ’til the wheels fall off and burn ’Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies”  ""Now I’ve always been the kind of person that doesn’t like to trespass but sometimes you just find yourself over the line Oh if there’s an original thought out there, I could use it right now"" (kind of sums up Bob's songwriting state of mind at that point in his career)  You always said people don’t do what they believe in, they just do what’s most convenient, then they repent And I always said, “Hang on to me, baby, and let’s hope that the roof stays on”"

bobdylan,371qaq,MothermaryHo,1 point,Mon May 25 10:59:38 2015 UTC,"Right, the idea I believe is songs written by/with or songs inspired by the Dead.  Perhaps the Dead covered that song at some point too?   As much as I would like to take credit for the collection, I didn't select them.  I found this collection online some time ago."
bobdylan,371ffd,Wiffle_Hammer,3,Sat May 23 23:38:38 2015 UTC,"Someone else can correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I know the Blu-ray has what is on the VHS plus the extra bonus footage that wasn't on the VHS version.  This was actually my 1st Bob Dylan show and easily the most memorable concert experience I've ever been to. Being able to see all of those people on 1 stage in 1 night is not something I can ever forget or not be grateful for getting the chance to see."
bobdylan,371ffd,TheDanimal438,2,Sun May 24 00:36:44 2015 UTC,"I liked most of the performances by the musicians paying tribute to Dylan, but I thought Dylan himself gave a very lackluster performance."
bobdylan,371ffd,TheDanimal438,1 point,Sun May 24 02:13:03 2015 UTC,I think because he tends to shy away from those kinds of events or adulation so I imagine it was a little hard for him to sit through that all night before he went on. Even during the backstage rehearsals you can tell he's kind of going through the motions instead of enjoying playing with all of his friends and admirers.

However, just to complicate things, I'll note that there is a 4 disc ""complete Bobfest"" which contains rehearsal footage and a few tracks that didn't even make it onto the Blu Ray.  It's a bootleg, and I do not have it, but it exists."

bobdylan,36z6w1,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Sat May 23 10:52:01 2015 UTC,"Man, this is incredible, thanks so much! I've been looking to get into RTR for a while now and after listening to Hard Rain, and loving it, last week I was pretty intrigued.   This and Bob's gospel periods are both unknown entities for me - mostly because I just haven't had the chance to get around to listening to these albums and performances. But yeah this is really cool, I got the Rolling Thunder book for Christmas last year as well so this gives me a good reason to start that now too."
bobdylan,36z6w1,willington123,1 point,Sat May 23 14:25:33 2015 UTC,"You're in for a treat, I tell you that.   I'd say get the key '75 shows first, as a bedding of sorts for '76. RTR #1 is far more pleasing to the ear, however, RTR #2 is more interesting, I think, as the shows are much more varied and experimental depending on the setting and Dylan's mood. For all of RTR #1's greatness, the shows and performances are generally very similar to each other and true surprises more infrequent.   Afraid I won't be able to help much with the gospel era though, as I only have a few shows from that period. But once I upload the other three shows from RTR, I might do a couple of the gospel ones (certainly Massey Hall from 1980 and probably one of the '81 ones)."
bobdylan,36z6w1,willington123,2,Mon May 25 15:10:47 2015 UTC,"Awesome, SS, thanks for your response, you certainly know the RTR back to front. I've finally got around to downloading the Plymouth show, and I'm planning to listen to it tomorrow while I plough through a heavy revision session.   It's interesting that you hold the Fort Collins (Hard Rain) show, and the '76 shows in such high regard, I love Hard Rain personally - But I remember reading that that reviews of the second leg weren't particularly glowing, owing mostly to the fact that some had thought the RTR had pretty much run of steam, so I'm interested to hear what you think about that."
bobdylan,36z6w1,DylanFloyd,1 point,Wed May 27 22:28:03 2015 UTC,"Hehe, no worries, but I'm far from an RTR scholar. Regretfully, I'm still missing some '76 shows, but there's a chunk of life to go yet, so perhaps one day...   I can certainly see why people thought they ran out of steam, but as I wrote above, I just don't think that's the case. Dylan's mood changed and with it the purpose of RTR. RTR #1 was a circus journeying on a wave of musical mysticism. It was a performance and Dylan was the band-leader.   RTR #2 is Dylan's catharsis. I've always figured that RTR #1 was Renaldo's road trip, as played by Bob Dylan, whilst RTR #2 was as close to a human Dylan has ever offered us live. The fact that this was a bitter and broken Dylan means it wasn't pleasant listening, and therein lies the hate for RTR #2. Give someone completely unfamiliar with Dylan's music RTR #1 and RTR #2 and most will prefer #1 (even though they might find it a bit weird). RTR #1 celebrates the joy of the creative mind. RTR #2 highlights its perils. It's not a difference of 'steam' or 'energy': we'd simply much rather listen to joy than pain.   Having said that, whilst I don't think Dylan himself ran out of steam in '76, I think the negativity affected the band and here, perhaps, we see signs of fatigue and/or lack of enthusiasm. Still, it couldn't have been that bad, as several musicians expressed interest in RTR #3 that many thought the '78 tour would turn out to be (retrospective Nelson Muntz-esque ""Ha ha!"" is in order here).   Why I enjoy '76 so much? Firstly, I just listened to '75 far too much and looked for the next best thing. Secondly (and now mainly), '76 is much more interesting as a tour. There are entire shows missing from that year - legendary ones at that (e.g. Salt Lake). There are shows like Tallahasse - magnificent performances that were recorded through a third generation mouldy potato. With '75, every show (bar New Jersey), you pretty much knew what you were going to get. '76 is much more varied - some shows are angry, some shows are sad, some shows are indifferent and there even are happy ones. Songs themselves change - You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome evolved from a slow meandering musing to a spirited send-off. There are more surprises, re-imaginings.   Overall, it's just a much less polished and more experimental affair than RTR #1. Some find that off-putting and I can absolutely see why - a lot of it doesn't sound good and a lot of the experiments fail (the It's Alright Mas are just painful to listen to). But I enjoy it because the tour hits home much more than '75 - it's more akin to real life, with all its failures and successes, all its triumphs and all its mundacity. I just feel an affinity to it and this is also what attracts me to early NET, which is a similar sort of thing, but with an older Dylan."
bobdylan,36z6w1,DylanFloyd,2,Thu May 28 11:23:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting!!!  I just listened to that 1976 'Tangled.'  Fascinating!  Hard to believe - I've been collection Dylan recordings for almost 15 years and somehow I never knew he performed it this way in 1976.    Just when you think you've heard them all, there's always a few more surprises..."
bobdylan,36z6w1,BredToUpset,2,Mon May 25 11:52:14 2015 UTC,"Indeed, it seems to be one of those 'blind spot' performances.   I think the problem is also that it is just too different. It's not one of those performances that you would exactly go sing the praises of to other people and it's not from a show with great sound (seeing as most Fort Collins bootlegs just include the soundboard stuff and ignore the audience recordings), so I suppose it gets lost amongst the more discernible highlights of '76.    But I do reckon that of all the curve balls he threw in '76 (Positively 4th Street, Visions, that If You See Her from Lakeland), this was probably one of the biggest ones. Speaking of If You See Her, have you ever heard the version from Tallahasse? Atrocious audio quality and cut as well, but bloody hell... I would give my figurative right arm to hear a soundboard of that.   At any rate, thought you might be interested in the Just Like A Woman rearrangement as well, so I uploaded that for you here.   I will say one thing about that take though: this is the only reasonably 'complete' take of the song. As with Tangled, they tried a whole lot of other tempos and arrangements (JLAW was tried as a pure blues song, Tangled with almost Pink Floyd-esque instrumental meanderings), but I suppose seeing as this is the only one they managed to get through, it's probably closest to what was played live (mind you, it's still very much a rehearsal).   But who knows, perhaps they switched rhythms mid-way through this one as well, because why not..."
bobdylan,36z6w1,DylanFloyd,1 point,Mon May 25 14:54:49 2015 UTC,Awesome!  I'm downloading JLAW now ... gonna take a few more listens for me to gather an opinion of the Tangled.   The only If You See Her I've heard from 1976 is the Lakeland one.

But this performance still shines through. It's difficult to distinguish the lyrics, so here's an attempted transcription, via Les Kokay's  RTR guide:   If you see her say hello, she might be in outer space She left here in a hurry; I could have got her to her place (gotten over to her place?) You might say that I'm in disarray, and for me time's standing still  Oh I've never gotten over her, I don't think I ever will  A bright light from me I saw salvation in her soul  Just one of those reckless situations, which nobody controls Well, the menagerie of life goes by, I try not to go  [We all do the best we can, (.....) grow ] (?)   If you're making love to her, watch it from the rear You'll never know when I'll be back, or liable to reappear For its natural to dream of peace like it is for rules to break  And right now I don't have too much to lose, so you'd better stay away  Sundown, silver moon, shining on the haze (hate?)  My heart can't understand no more, what my head don't tolerate  Well I know she'll be back someday, of that there is no doubt And when that moment comes Lord, give me the strength to keep her out"

bobdylan,36wzzb,tonyfranciosa,2,Sat May 23 01:05:37 2015 UTC,"""The Parrot that Talked"" is usually regarded as Chekov's homage to the demise of Dylan's marriage, though some commentators regard ""The Blind Man at the Gate"" as an equally likely contender."

bobdylan,36lqy6,SurrealistSwimmer,4,Wed May 20 10:44:36 2015 UTC,"It's suuuuuuch a good record, though, mate! I feel so bad that you don't like it 'cause I think it's one of his best, period.   I listen to it in the subway sometimes. Something about being underground, watching all the people pass by, everyone with their own narratives, their own problems - the poetry of the music just engulfs you. And the music is so perfectly played that, like butter, it just spreads across his singing - it literally feels like you're searching for shadows in the night. I guess I can also identify with a lot of what he's singing there.   I don't buy the whole thing about him just being old and wanting to reminisce or even the Sinatra tribute thing. I think these are absolutely stellar songs, the kind of which music has not seen since, and the way Dylan sings them... it almost seems like time traveling. Like you're sitting in the corner of a smoke-filled saloon, hat down, eyes in your pockets and any day your long lost love might walk through that door and take a seat right across from you. And you're just waiting and waiting and waiting for shadows in the night..."
bobdylan,36lqy6,solarandlunar,2,Wed May 20 16:17:16 2015 UTC,"That was very neatly written and quite possibly the most enjoyable review of SITN I've yet read - thank you for taking the time to write it.   Trust me, I too am quite disappointed in that I don't enjoy it. By no means is it a bad record and I appreciate the quality of the recordings. But for me... there is just something missing for me to be able to enjoy it. Nevertheless, I've had this with Dylan records before and some took me years to get into (looking at you, gospel years), so perhaps this will be the case with that one too.   I think part of the problem is that I've always valued 'Dylan the Songwriter' more than 'Dylan the Song Interpreter'. This is a gent I'm quite convinced will be one of the top three names mentioned if someone asks 'Who is the most important artist of the 20th century?' 200 years from now. To see him on such a roll as he is now and not writing/releasing his own songs... I value him as an artist and he's always been his own man, but I just wish he'd release a record of original material instead of Sinatra covers.   But then again, I enjoye the 90s acoustic records, so it can't just be the fact they're covers. I guess it is something about the songs too. Who I am and where I am in my life - they just don't speak to me like they do to you and I sincerely wish they did. Maybe in another age, things will be different.   Live, however, live it is another matter entirely - both Stay With Me and Autumn Leaves have been the highlights of this year, so I wouldn't at all mind if he plays more SITN songs come summer/autumn when I'll be seeing him a rather unholy amount of times."
bobdylan,36lqy6,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Wed May 20 17:26:57 2015 UTC,This sounds really similar to the studio recording though
bobdylan,36lqy6,ThinWildMercury1,5,Wed May 20 11:14:54 2015 UTC,"It does. I'll put it this way: Dylan put out some great sounding records in the 2005-2012 period but I felt he rarely gave his songs the 'album' treatment live. By 'album treatment' I don't mean the musical arrangement, but mostly care and time.   For instance, songs like Workingman's Blues or the 2007 studio Hard Rain sounded great on an album, that same period often saw them upsung and then barked live (along with many other fine tunes).   So to see him put so much focus and dedication to his live performances so often and so consistently, it warms my cynical heart. I only started seeing Dylan some 10 years ago and always accepted the fact that I'd never get to witness 'peak Dylan'. This recent renaissance of his, propagated by the Set, shattered that unfortunate expectation and I look forward to the shows I'm seeing with glee and delight I've never quite experienced before.   Would I prefer a re-arranged version of the song? Perhaps. But it's not the arrangement I admire: it's the fact that here, right now and before my very eyes, stands Dylan in such form I can proudly turn to all my acquaintances and say: now that's a bloody artist!"
bobdylan,36lqy6,SurrealistSwimmer,6,Wed May 20 13:23:40 2015 UTC,That was a spot on intro by Dave. Agreed on all points!
bobdylan,36lqy6,nostrilz,9,Wed May 20 13:57:19 2015 UTC,His voice sounds amazing!
bobdylan,36lqy6,kakature,2,Wed May 20 09:32:33 2015 UTC,sounded amazing seriously
bobdylan,36lqy6,MallowCocktail,6,Wed May 20 17:10:27 2015 UTC,"I liked it, but being that I haven't seen Dylan live in a long time I am seriously curious (and a little concerned) about what all the little aimless shuffling around the stage is about."
bobdylan,36lqy6,TheDanimal438,19,Wed May 20 15:13:21 2015 UTC,"I felt like that should have been narrated, a little something suggesting his internal monologue: ""Stupid jacket...Stupid jacket...Come on, now, jacket, stick with me...Better grab the harmonica. Nope, there's no harmonica in this song. How would I even play harmonica on a song like this? Now what do I do? Vamp on the guitar I gues--shit. Back to the piano, ah shit, no. Donnie's playing the steel for another moment or so still. I'll look at the camera. That was probably weird. Walk around. Walk around where? Just walk around. I'll go near the drums. Look natural. That's not natural. Hurry up, Donnie. Alright, get to the mic, it's time to sing again. Woops, not quite yet. Okay..."""
bobdylan,36lqy6,willington123,5,Wed May 20 15:24:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure either - I know what you mean by your concern though, as he appears a little bit lost, but I think he's just a bit unsure of what to do with himself while the instrumental part comes in."
bobdylan,36lqy6,TheDanimal438,2,Wed May 20 15:38:33 2015 UTC,"It was more the way he acted at the end of the song that made me lean towards the ""concerned"" end as he looks a little lost when the song ends and barely registers that Dave's coming over to greet him.  One of those subtle things I'm gonna miss about Dave is his little nod and ""O.K."" sign to the drummer. ""All brushes."" I love that Dave approves of the all brushes."
bobdylan,36lqy6,willington123,3,Wed May 20 17:28:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah I see what you mean, though I think it's more nervousness than anything - I must admit I'm not sure I've ever seen Bob entirely comfortable during a TV performance."
bobdylan,36lqy6,litewo,4,Wed May 20 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"In a real concert, he'll wander over to the side and strike poses where he puts his hands on his hips and just sort of stares off at the audience. In this song, he doesn't know what to do with himself when he's not singing. I'd imagine he'd be at the piano if he was playing a regular show."
bobdylan,36lqy6,j1mcamp,3,Wed May 20 16:08:34 2015 UTC,Those were his dance moves!
bobdylan,36lqy6,I_Fuck_Whales,2,Thu May 21 03:44:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah me too. Does he do it on purpose? I don't get it, he does it at the live shows I've been to recently."
bobdylan,36lqy6,mandalore237,6,Wed May 20 15:16:11 2015 UTC,I think he just gets a little awkward when he doesn't have anything to do on stage
bobdylan,36lqy6,MallowCocktail,2,Wed May 20 17:03:16 2015 UTC,i think thats typical of him to move a bit

bobdylan,36nmrn,kakature,2,Thu May 21 08:55:06 2015 UTC,Yeah something like that. It's really annoying. There are 2 price categories (€ 70 and € 80) and you just pick a category and hope you get a good seat. For some events you're able to see where you'll be sitting but not for Bob.

bobdylan,36hrau,ps_,5,Tue May 19 17:06:43 2015 UTC,"Great article, thanks, man.  That performance, especially Jokerman, is one of my absolute favourites. A couple of months ago someone posted a link to an online discussion - I can't remember where - and JJ Holiday, one of the guitarists accompanying Bob, was replying to questions and talking about that performance on Letterman and rehearsing with Bob. I remember him saying that there was discussion of them cutting an album together, it never happened of course. Though I'm sure it would have been pretty incredible."
bobdylan,36hrau,willington123,3,Tue May 19 17:47:34 2015 UTC,The article also says there was talk of an incognito bar tour.   That would have been amazing.
bobdylan,36hrau,willington123,3,Tue May 19 17:59:42 2015 UTC,"Haha I know right, incredible, but probably a little bit surreal if Bob Dylan just showed up and started playing!"

bobdylan,36hrau,ps_,3,Tue May 19 18:04:47 2015 UTC,"Funny, but not unexpected.  He could have almost as likely made them his new fulltime band."

bobdylan,36hrau,Koko2315,2,Tue May 19 18:12:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, admittedly it is a little strange. Apparently, instead of cutting an album, Bob decided to go on tour with more famous guys, i.e. Mick Taylor, instead and that's where they recorded Real Live.   Shame really, a new wave album with Bob and these guys would've been awesome."
bobdylan,36hrau,ps_,3,Tue May 19 18:27:24 2015 UTC,"So not surprising  ""The tunes may have been simple enough, but Dylan’s instructions could be inscrutable. Holiday remembers him asking the band to play one song “with a stripper beat and add a marching band onto it"""

It's one of those songs where the melody is pleasant and compelling, but it's subtle; the rhythm has a nice lilt to it, and you move with it, but there are songs with more compelling rhythms, more mysterious rhythms; the lyrics construct a world we've definitely heard him construct before. So what is it? I don't know.   The same applies to Things Have Changed, too, I think: what makes those songs soar so high in that unparalleled field of timeless songs? Don't know, just dig it."

bobdylan,36f475,TobyCelery,2,Mon May 18 23:53:48 2015 UTC,"I always thought of this as his most lyrically sophisticated song. It reads like a much older man wrote it. There isn't a parallel in popular music, as far as I can tell, except maybe some Sondheim lyrics. I only ever am reminded of plays by this song, and vice versa: Strindberg's The Creditors; Ibsen's Hedda Gabler; Stoppard's The Real Thing are this song's cousins. it has no relations elsewhere. His most literary achievement.   Good choice. My compliments."
bobdylan,36f475,gwmercure,2,Tue May 19 01:12:55 2015 UTC,"Hey, I know people who like 'Joey'! And it's not a bad song at all, in my opinion. It's a bit too long and drags here and there, but it's a nice story and it has some good lyrics and imagery (I especially like the part of Joey pushing over the table to protect his family and staggering into the streets of Little Italy).    Now to answer your actual question: it's almost impossible to pick my favorite Dylan song. I think the best he has ever done is 'Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands', but I don't know if I would call it my favorite. (Similar to how I think 'Citizen Kane' is obviously one of the best films ever made, but I wouldn't say it's my favorite because I never rewatch it --though I listen to 'Sad Eyed Lady' often!).    I think if you define 'favorite' as: which song do you play more than others; which song can you hear over and over again without ever getting tired of it; which song always gets you excited, no matter how many times you've heard it... I'll have to go with 'Changing of the Guards' (1999 mix).    Its sound, its musical richness, its haunting atmosphere, its beautiful imagery, its lyrical complexity, Bob's powerful singing: it all builds on each other to form a most perfect unity. I could listen to it for days. In fact, after I first heard the album I kept playing the song every single day for about a month. :)    I also like this live version very, very much. I can totally lose myself in it whenever I listen to it, it's so great:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1RXVc4TYkU"

Infidels was one of his first albums that wasn't an outright gospel album after Shot of Love. So you have Bob Dylan, using the already amazing poetic imagery of the Bible, making an album with Mark Knopfler, Mick Taylor, and Sly and Robbie. His voice is good, the guitar is restrained but effective and the lyricism is as good as he's ever written and he plays great harmonica.  You can tell he believes what he's saying.

Just Like Tom Thumbs Blues. That is a heck of a song, one of my most played songs of his. But... Desolation Row. A song really deserving of the title 'masterpiece'. I mean, the lyrics and the vocal cadences tear me apart. 'And you would not think to look at him, but he was famous long ago'. So definitely Desolation Row. A Rimbaudian free form narrative that somehow captures the human condition in all its painful glory. I dont think it can be topped."

But some of my other favorites include ""One More Cup of Coffee"", ""I Want You"", and ""My Back Pages"".  But my all-time favorite Dylan tune is almost undoubtedly ""It's Alright, Ma"".  It's so close to perfect.  The lyrics open with a bang and never let up, the riff he plays between the verses is great, and his voice is incredibly forceful.  ""He not busy being born is busy dying"" and ""Money doesn't talk, it swears"" are also two of his best lines."

bobdylan,36d568,SurrealistSwimmer,6,Mon May 18 13:02:16 2015 UTC,"Hard Rain is a very peculiar beast. Much like you, I hated it when I first listened to it. It just seemed painfully angry. Fast forward a few years and Rolling Thunder #2 is one of my favourite tours.   The trouble with Hard Rain (and Bootleg Series #5) is that they're not representative of a whole show from that era. They're just performances pasted together in seemingly no particular way. If you take a sample set list, let's say Fort Worth, you get this:    Mr. Tambourine Man (acoustic) It Ain't Me Babe (acoustic) Vincent Van Gogh Maggie's Farm One Too Many Mornings Mozambique Isis     (break of 13 songs performed by Joni Mitchell, Roger McGuinn and Joan Baez respectively)     Blowin' In The Wind (w/ Baez) Railroad Boy (w/ Baez) Deportees (w/ Baez) I Pity The Poor Immigrant (w/ Baez) Shelter From The Storm I Threw It All Away Stuck Inside Mobile Oh Sister You're A Big Girl Now You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome Lay Lady Lay Silver Mantis (T-Bone Burnett) Going Going Gone Idiot Wind Knockin' On Heaven's Door Gotta Travel On   The '76 shows started with acoustic numbers (just Dylan, harmonica and guitar) followed by a 'sign-along-y' VVG. Then came a quartet of electric songs (with the rather slow One Too Many Mornings in its midst) which finished off Dylan's first set. Other artists did their bits and the second Dylan slot started with Dylan and Baez doing four acoustic duets. A longer solo Dylan set followed, again with a slow middle section in Oh Sister and You're A Big Girl Now. There was another break with T-Bone Burnett, following which we took a stroll via Going Going Gone to reach the show's climax: the desperate Idiot Wind. Once the audience recovered from that, we got two further sing-alongs with Heaven's Door and Gotta Travel On.   So, as you can see, a '76 show was much more dynamic than what the album would make you believe.   Frankly, I don't know what the rationale behind the TV special was. They filmed one at Clearwater (the 'unrealeased Hard Rain') which is much quieter and more intimate than the Fort Collins show that was eventually shown on TV. Nevertheless, Clearwater was arranged specifically with the TV special in mind, so a few excellent performances aside (Tambourine Man, Just Like A Woman), the show felt a bit devoid of spirit. At the Fort Collins show, however, Dylan was in full 'raging bitterness' mode that is so often associated with Rolling Thunder #2.   I would assume they were limited in terms of how long the TV special should be. So they put a few songs together and showed that on TV. It probably wasn't enough for a full LP, so they added some Fort Worth songs and released that. The result was... underwhelming, to say the least. I would argue they aren't bad performances, but they are taken out of context and aren't necessarily the finest performances of the shows, let alone the tour.   So, why the hate for Hard Rain? Firstly, it was the wrong Rolling Thunder for official release. RTR #1 was mystical, fascinating, inspired. It was the renegade gypsy minstrels of the 60s, roaming a nation and spreading their tales of magical love, Mexican heists and a jailed boxer.   Someone at the record label must've clocked this and once Rolling Thunder #2 got going, they felt this was an opportunity to cash in. Alas, by this point, Dylan was elsewhere. Marriage not only collapsing but seemingly irrecoverably so, Dylan seems to have given up on the magic and portrayed a broken, bitter man. There was little real love left by RTR #2 - it was regret for a love once great but now out of touch and a desperate game of trying to find someone to blame.   I adamantly disagree that RTR #2 is Dylan 'running out of steam' - far from it. The band, perhaps (after all, who here likes working for a broken boss?). RTR #2 is the hangover of RTR #1. It is not pleasant viewing or listening. We want to watch comedies, super hero films and feel-good love stories. No one wants to watch a man break apart. That's where Hard Rain (and RTR #2 as a whole) becomes commercially poisonous. That's also where it becomes almost painfully relatable for those who have gone through it.   You're not 'wrong' in not liking Hard Rain. I still think some performances are superb: One Too Many Mornings, Mobile, Lay Lady Lay, You're A Big Girl Now and, of course, Idiot Wind. It's much easier to see what's going on if you watch the video.   But Hard Rain certainly isn't what '76 was about. '76 was about the soaring Tambourine Man. The cynical It Ain't Me Babe. The bleeding If You See Her, Say Hello and the resigned Just Like A Woman. The see-saw of using music to get away from life and that same music bringing you back (I Threw It All Away in particular is a frustrating ride in this respect).   He's trying to do something new with his music (Shelter, Maggie, Tangled Up In Blue, Seven Days), trying to re-create the magic of RTR #1 (Isis, Durango), trying to please his audience (Tambourine Man, Rolling Stone, Baez duets) whilst fighting his own relentless demons (If You See Her, You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome, Idiot Wind). Rolling Thunder #2 isn't 'nice'. It is a snapshot of Bob Dylan, the human. It is, in fact, a snapshot of any human trapped in the circus of life, where he juggles his own innovation, nostalgia, desire to be loved and his loss and heart-break. And that is why Rolling Thunder #2 is, in my mind, reaching something greater than any other Dylan tour."
bobdylan,36d568,comet3popeye,3,Mon May 18 14:15:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your well thought out reply. Do you happen to write profesionally (for a living)? Seems like you could. You have a way with words. I really enjoyed reading what you had to say about RTR and Hard Rain. Although I'm not by any means a newcomer to Bob Dylan and am quite familiar with his backstory/lifestory that's intertwined with his music and performances throughout his career, you provided some new insights and fresh perspectives on the man in relation to the shows in RTR #2. I appreciate that.    I had read that the main criticism from fans and critics alike has always been that the records never tried to recreate the structure or atmosphere of the original shows. Even though the Bootleg one seems to have garnered a lot of praise, that still remains the main criticism. I would have loved to see/hear a complete show from the first leg of the tour. Going by your post, Hard Rain isn't a true representation of it at all. Your post gives a very detailled idea of what a show in RTR #1 was like, I appreciate that.    I was surprised to see some of the tracks you listed as being among your favorites on Hard Rain. Particularly Lay, Lady, Lay which I did not enjoy at all. The background information that you provide certainly gives important context to the performances and are helpful to understand in what place Dylan was at the time, but it still doesn't make me like it any more. I just think it sounds very bad.    By that I don't mean everything has to sound pitch-perfect. If I wanted that in music, I would've never become a fan of Dylan (with his ""ugly voice"", as people say). It's just this shouting/yelling style that I find very off-putting. Maybe I'll get used to it, though. I've seen a performance of Isis that he did in that way and that was great. But maybe that's because it's just one song and an entire album full of it becomes tiring..."
bobdylan,36d568,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Mon May 18 15:53:06 2015 UTC,"Give it 30 years, you'll love every little hiss and fart on there."
bobdylan,36d568,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Mon May 18 17:17:46 2015 UTC,"Ah, thank you very much for your kind words! I fear the extent of my writing (reddit aside) only goes as far as unnecessarily candid and verbose out-of-office replies, but one never knows what one'll do when the joints get old and rusty...   In terms of RTR, the above set list was actually a mid to late 1976 show, nevertheless, the format was similar, even though the acoustic slot was usually later on in the show after the Baez duets.   I plan to post the Fort Collins '76 show here on Saturday (seeing as it will be its 39th anniversary) but I'll find a good-sounding '75 one (probably Plymouth #2) and post that one as well, so you can compare. It'll only be the Dylan set though, not the full thing (which may be a blessing to some).   To be honest, I really didn't like that Lay Lady Lay arrangement for a long time. I think this one was a case of listening to it so many times whilst listening to other things that I just got used to it. A bit like a beer you don't enjoy at first and then find yourself ordering it round after round. Some might say I uncovered some hidden meaning or nuance, which may be so, but I honestly think that my brain simply re-calibrated itself to cope with the amount of times I've listened to it and chose 'love it' as a default setting.   However, it depends on the version. The Clearwater one from the 'Unreleased Hard Rain' is a bit more intimate, which I think suits the song better than the Fort Collins stadium ambience used on the official live album.   I find it interesting though that you don't enjoy Hard Rain because of the shouting whilst I don't listen to many of the '78 shows for the exact same reason (and yet you like Budokan). The '78 tour, to my ears, is much more shouty, particularly when he reaches the US later in the year. Some performances even seem like one long wail. Don't get me wrong though - when '78 gets on form, it is sublime (the European shows spring to mind, or individual US dates). But I find it interesting that it bothers you more on Hard Rain than it does on Budokan."
bobdylan,36d568,DylanFloyd,2,Thu May 21 14:43:07 2015 UTC,"That would be so great, if you would post both those shows on here! I would greatly appreciate it and I'm sure lots of others would as well.    You're right, 'Lay, Lady, Lay' deserves a more intimate treatment; it doesn't work that well if it doesn't have one (in my opinion).    I haven't heard much from the '78 tour except Budokan. I've heard some songs he did in the US, but not much. I think it's because they're a different kind of shouty... if that makes sense. ;) I mean, I feel like he still used more nuance and variation in his voice during the Budokan/'78 tour. Hard Rain seems to be the exact same tone of voice the entire time. It sounds monotonous to me. Whereas in this performance of Changing of the Guards (which I absolutely adore) he's still ""shouty"" but does it in more varied tones. There seems to be more passion in his voice. Just the part where he goes ""fortune CAAAAAALLS"" early in the song gives me goosebumps all over.    That's not to say there are no lackluster performances during that period either. His Budokan rendition of 'Shelter from the Storm' is entirely monotonous as well. Apart from the musical backing, it sounds like it could've been on the Hard Rain album. But overall, when I think of all the tracks, like Mr. Tambourine Man, It's Alright Ma, Ballad of a Thin Man etc., I can't say he was shouting really."
bobdylan,36d568,showbizkid,1 point,Thu May 21 17:08:23 2015 UTC,"Indeed, Charlotte '78 (where that Changing of the Guards is from) is regarded by many as the best show of '78.   Budokan is an odd one. Even fans of '78 seem to dislike it, but I've always had a soft spot for it. The Japan tour early that year was apparently all sorts of uncomfortable, with musicians who thought they were signing up for Rolling Thunder #3 getting saxophones and backing singers instead and even Dylan himself seemingly unsure of what he was doing. But I quite like that atmosphere of him trying yet again something completely different and it sometimes working very well and sometimes not at all.   With a few band changes, I think the European shows that followed in the summer hit a sweet spot, with still a little bit of uncertainty, a little bit of experimentation but a whole lot more confidence. Some performances from that tour are my favourite of his whole career.   By autumn and the US shows, it has become a much more confident enterprise and Dylan was really belting it out. But it was at this point where I feel it became a bit more shouty and, despite what people say, I'd rather listen to Budokan than some of those shows.   Hmmm... if people enjoy the Rolling Thunders, a '78-off after that might be a good idea  Speaking of '76, here's a different side of what RTR #2 was about (in case you haven't seen them) - Mr Tambourine Man, Times They Are A-Changin' and Just Like A Woman. Not really the best performances of the tour (bar the JLAW, which is my favourite version of the song) but it shows a different side to how that tour sounded."
bobdylan,36d568,showbizkid,2,Thu May 21 18:07:49 2015 UTC,"Well said.  The choice of songs and the lyrical 'Blood on the Tracks' changes show a man in great emotional pain.  At this point he is no longer pining to reunite with his love (RTR #1 - Sara) while on a political crusade (RTR#1 - Hurricane).  Indeed the original RTR has some of Bob's best singing and performing of his life, captured well on the Live 1975 official bootleg release.  That being said, the 1976 RTR#2 is more emotional and more interesting to me.  The album Hard Rain failed to capture much of the magic, as noted above.  My favorites are the brilliant 'A Hard Rains A-Gonna Fall' in which he directs the band mid-song(!) to sing the chorus the way HE is, not the way it was on the record (why was this not on the album named Hard Rain???).  Also the Blood on the Tracks songs - at least they DID get the biting 'Idiot Wind' and the great rocking arrangement of 'Shelter' - that weren't on the album: 'You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome' and a truly remarkable lyrical rewrite of 'If You See Her Say Hello' - ""if you're makin' love to her, watch it from the rear ... you never know when I'll be back or liable to appear"" !!!  So, you really have to seek out the bootlegs - a few concerts were recorded with great quality.  But my first impression of the album wasn't great, either - I didn't understand the new arrangements or the brevity of the album."
bobdylan,36d568,showbizkid,4,Mon May 18 14:35:14 2015 UTC,"I love Hard Rain. It's a punk album, isn't it?....also Dylan has way more shouty vocals on Before The Flood than HR."
bobdylan,36d568,kingtao,2,Mon May 18 21:14:41 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think Dylan is much more in control over his voice on the Before the Flood record.

It's all there, the passion, the history, the improvisation, momentum, control, belief, tone, love, no fear, so brave, lost in performance.

bobdylan,366g4r,Buck1Mulligan,9,Sat May 16 16:45:54 2015 UTC,"I believe at one time Dylan said that Sad Eyed Lady was the best song he ever wrote. Also, the song's initial recording was a kind of once in a lifetime moment - the band was apparently unaware of how long it was, and attempted to play towards a peak with every chorus, leading to them constantly try to top themselves as it went along.   Given all that, I think it's fair to think that Dylan never thought he could replicate it live. He seems to like playing with songs' arrangements because he never feels that they're complete and wants to revise them, or build on them more. Sad Eyed Lady, however, is perfect."
bobdylan,366g4r,willington123,6,Sat May 16 18:45:00 2015 UTC,"I think from all of these listed we just have to accept that Bob is Bob and he pretty much plays what he wants when he wants.   For instance, he's performed Million Dollar Bash once, at the Brixton Academy in 2005?! Why and for what reason I'm not sure anyone knows.  Also, in my opinion, his greatest song, Abandoned Love, played once at the Other End in New York, 1975 - though I'm thankful for that performance, it is without doubt my favourite recording/noise of anything ever."

bobdylan,366g4r,BamaDillert,3,Sun May 17 09:25:16 2015 UTC,"I think you might find this list quite helpful. It appears he played Subterranean Homesick Blues quite a lot - 120 times. However, he didn't play it live until the 1980s.   Blonde on Blonde came out near the end of his touring in 1966 - I believe it came out the same month that his world tour ended. Of course, after the motorcycle accident he stopped touring for a while, so it wouldn't have given him a chance to play stuff from Blonde on Blonde live. He did have the final version Sad Eyed Lady of the lowlands recorded in February of 1966, so he could very well have played it live in any of concerts, but he never did. He did, however, play a number of other songs from Blonde on Blonde before the album's official release during his concert at the Manchester Free Trade Hall. He did have the option of choosing to play Sad-Eyed Lady live, but he may have chosen to omit it from his set list due to time constraints, or because it was a difficult song to replicate during a live performance.   The other songs from Blonde on Blonde were much easier to reproduce live because the backing instruments could easily be replaced by a lone acoustic guitar and the song wouldn't suffer. Desolation Row, though nearly as long as Sad Eyed Lady, was musically simple, and the only difficult there would be remembering the lyrics. I'm sure he could have figured out a way to play it live with his band, but there were much better alternatives that were far less of a challenge.  On top of all that, it's a very personal song, and by the time he started going on tour again in 1974, his relationship with Sara wasn't too strong (they seperated in 1977). It might just be that he never got the chance to play it in '66, and then never had the desire to play it on subsequent tours on account of its subject matter. And by 1974, he had plenty of other material (in addition to his older stuff) to play."

But given his commitment to introducing the new material, I'm surprised we haven't seen Narrow Way, Life is Hard, Shake Shake Mama, Someday Baby...  Related: I've had a fantasy for quite some time that one day Dylan will announce his retirement from touring and live performance. A final tour will be a huge event: stops will be littered with tunes that have never been performed live--Temporary Like Achilles, I am a Lonesome Hobo, Abandoned Love*--culminating in the last encore of the last date: Up to Me."
bobdylan,366g4r,Awkward_Arab,3,Sat May 16 20:37:40 2015 UTC,Abandoned Love has already been performed live and it'll never be topped
bobdylan,366g4r,gwmercure,2,Sun May 17 19:42:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I love that version, and it was the reason for the asterisk. I don't know how official that performance is.  Whether any live performance can be topped is a dubious suggestion: I don't think the man judges them that way. There are some clunkers out there, but I get the impression that the spirit has been to reinvent the tunes. I don't think he ever has the idea that, for example, a country soul version in B will better serve a song than a blues version in F. How well he inhabits a song in performance has always been the test for me: and as their performances change, the songs and their meanings change, and so, necessarily, does that factor.  This is not necessarily your perspective, but I get from a lot of Dylan fans that that particular performance of Abandoned Love is definitive, which takes the emphasis away from the song itself; it's a great song, and I wish I could hear more lives for it."

bobdylan,366g4r,gwmercure,1 point,Tue May 19 01:31:34 2015 UTC,"I think Infidels got plenty of play during the 80s, midnite cafe actually uploaded a sweet show with a couple tracks off the album. I've got a lot of love for Infidels (truth be told, I can say that for pretty much all of Bob's work), it's chock full of good tracks that seem to get little love from casual fans. Sweetheart like you, license to kill, and especially I and I, it's one helluva track, 'someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm only listening to my heart', is a killer line.  I wish he would've played dirge live, I don't think he's ever done it before. I think that's a song that would definitely suit his singing style nowadays, it's line after line of venom, he sang it brilliantly on planet waves, just full of rage. With the right musical arrangement, he can recreate it into something else entirely. Kinda like how masters of war sounds different on the later shows, it was accusatory when he was young, and it sounds ominous in the later shows, same words, just two completely different songs. That's why I love how much thought Bob puts into the music behind the words he pens."

There are a few other good re-writes in that version, but this one, for whatever reason, always gets me.   Oh, and the whole '76 re-write of Idiot Wind is I think superior to both the New York and Minnesota versions.   The '84 Tangled Up In Blue is also immensely interesting as a re-write (I believe Dylan said something to the effect of the '84 version being closest to what the song is really about) but I do prefer the '75 live version the most, I have to say."

The Rolling Stones were told to change “Let’s Spend the Night Together” to “Let’s Spend Some Time Together” — and obliged. The Doors were told to change a line from “Light My Fire”    Let's Spend the Night Together was written in 1967. Light My Fire was written in 1966. Dylan's appearance occurred in 1963.   This author has an interesting understanding of chronology.
bobdylan,35veoi,justinrcary,2,Wed May 13 20:57:16 2015 UTC,"""You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go"" is what immediately pops into my head, although it's very clearly a love song and I'm not sure if that's what you're after.  ""On the Road Again"" is a nice silly description of being in a place you don't belong and being ready to move on. ""Honey, how come you don't move?""  ""Mississippi"" maybe? ""Everybody movin’ if they ain’t already there Everybody got to move somewhere Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow Things should start to get interestin' right about now""  ""Isis"" is about a journey and starting anew.  ""It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry"" is about living life on the move.  And ""Forever Young"" is a wonderful good-luck wish. I prefer the fast version, but listen to both.  I'm sure other people will have other choices. The problem with some of these is that they're rather melancholy, but that's what you get with Dylan. Hope this was helpful!"

I think these songs put on some kind of playlist would be a nice soundtrack for a road trip or first few months of a new city. They all have a certain vibe that one can probably generalize with when getting a fresh start in a new city or something like that.  Songs about moving on and understanding how not to make the same mistakes and evolve I guess. Songs about life and living it.

One such example is from the last Philadelphia show.   But I quite like this slightly more raw early version (the audio from my original post came from the tour's first show in Chicago) even though I think at some point I hear some people trying to do a clap-along. I sincerely hope they have been punished later on in life if that truly was the case.   Still, I've always felt it was a real shame he kind of gave up on the song mid-way through the tour, as it's one that perhaps could've grown quite well. A '76 rendition of it would, I think, have been very captivating indeed."

In the collection of ballads compiled by Francis James Child in the late nineteenth century, it is indexed as Child Ballad number 95; eleven variants, some fragmentary, are indexed as 95A to 95K.  The Roud number is 144. The ballad existed in a number of folkloric variants from many different countries, and has been remade in a variety of formats. It was recorded in 1939 as ""The Gallis Pole"" by folk singer Huddie ""Lead Belly"" Ledbetter, but the most famous version was the 1970 arrangement of the Fred Gerlach version by English rock band Led Zeppelin, which was titled ""Gallows Pole"" on the album Led Zeppelin III.

Every single day. Flip through your local paper until you find one.   And that's been the case for over thirty years, give or take.  When Dylan, God forbid, passes on, it's likely that ten different broadcasts will mark ten different songs as his best known. Blowin' in the Wind; The Times they are a' Changin', Knockin' on Heaven's Door, Mr. Tambourine Man.  Take the most foolish, uneducated, insulated, in-curious young person in the world and say ""Romeo and Juliet"" to them; say ""The Mona Lisa"" to them; say ""...To be or not to be..."" to them. It will sound familiar, so integrated into western culture beyond drama and theatre and Renaissance painting are Shakespeare and Da Vinci. THAT is Dylan's legacy: not The Beatles, not Elvis, not the Rolling Stones: Shakespeare, Da Vinci, Dante, Cervantes, Homer..."
bobdylan,35g3u9,gwmercure,13,Sun May 10 13:04:14 2015 UTC,"All I know is it's going to be one of the worst days of my life when he does pass on.  To me, what Dylan does really, really well is portray the experience of being an outsider. He never quite fit wherever he was: the folk music movement was suffocating him, so he went electric. The ""voice of a generation"" adulation made him uncomfortable, so he completely reinvented himself in the late '60s and again in the '70s. He turned to Christianity after that, and that still seems important to him today, but eventually he left that movement too. And even now you never have any idea what the hell he's going to do, because he's not easily labelled. And I don't think he could let himself fall into that kind of pattern if he wanted to.  And that feeling of never quite fitting in, the self-conscious inability to stick with any group for very long, is something that he portrays in his music better and more consistently than anyone else has. Sometimes very explicitly, like in ""It Ain't Me"" or ""It's Alright Ma."" ""Desolation Row"" is a bunch of outcasts trying to get by. ""Visions of Johanna"" is the yearning for something else even when surrounded by people who you like and who like you. And on and on and on.  So as far as his legacy, yeah, of course people will remember his songs, and people will remember him too. He's one of the most important cultural figures of the 20th century. But I think more importantly than that, there will always be people who don't quite feel attached to the world around them, who are restless regardless of who they're around or what they're doing. And where (many of) those people are, there will be Dylan."
bobdylan,35g3u9,t-pat,5,Sun May 10 02:08:05 2015 UTC,"This is wonderful. But I must add something about Dylan being an outsider.  There is something stridently American in Dylan's legacy: he seems to have experienced first-hand everything that was a marvel to him as a young man growing up in the infancy of broadcast media, and everything he was somehow locked out of: he was a working class kid from the midwest who found dreams and a different world in the country, blues, and rock and roll on the radio, a distinctly urban experience, and one that often drew from a sharp contrast between the classes; he was a Jew living in America who converted to the prevailing faith of the American people; he was a small-town kid in an insular world fixed by imaginary boundaries of class, family, income, and, according to him, climate, whose first identity approximated that of the boundless troubadour, galloping from Gallup, New Mexico to Woody Guthrie's sick-bed; he was a folksinger, the darling of the white-guilt left, who changed that accursed rock and roll forever; with major label demands and domineering guidance from an overzealous manager, he recorded one of the most compelling and influential collections of popular songs of the twentieth century. In a basement. Then didn't release it. He is the universally panned vocalist who has won a Best Male Rock Vocal Grammy and recorded a heralded collection of standards; he's been treated tepidly by rock radio, and he's been a DJ; he was appointed the voice of the folk left, so he identified with the man who killed Kennedy...and on and on and on, even down to his guitars: strongly identified with Martin acoustics, he rejected the company's efforts to prepare a signature edition, claiming he didn't want to be associated with only one guitar maker, then did a signature edition with Gibson.  It isn't that he is a hypocrite, and it isn't that he is an outsider: it is that he REFUSES to be an outsider: from a small town? We'll see about that. Not a Christian? We'll see about that. The voice of a generation? We'll see about that. Can't sing? We'll see about that. Folksinger? We'll see about that. Not known as a piano player? We'll see about that. He's not an outsider at all, not by a long shot: he's a master at picking locks that would overwhelm most others, no one has picked more of them than Bob Dylan.   He's the most liberating artist of a hundred years or more. He's the Moses of America. He is the personification of the American Dream: he is the American Dream walking around, pissing on Horatio Alger books.  When they want to know about the enlightenment's influence on art, they will go to Da Vinci; when they want to know about the influence of myth, history, and pan-European literature on drama and poetry, they will go to Shakespeare; when they want to know about American art as it was influenced by American ideals and the proliferation of broadcast media, they will go to Bob Dylan. Dylan's voice among American letters is equal to Walt Whitman. Not because he was an outsider but because, like Whitman, he refused to be."
bobdylan,35g3u9,gwmercure,5,Sun May 10 18:50:29 2015 UTC,"As someone who discovered Dylan as a 16-year-old, much like you (though 20 years ago) I understand where you're coming from.  To answer your legacy question, I need only cite the sidebar here.     the poet laureate of rock 'n' roll.    He'll live with me forever, and if I can help it, with my children as well, having sung them to sleep with beautiful Dylan ballads.    I started with ""Times"" and ""Blowing in the Wind"" but hardly ever listen to those any longer.  He's so much deeper than that and I envy your ability to discover him in the age of the internet.    Here's one of the first videos I ever downloaded from the internet.  I coveted it as a college student, but it's freely available now.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32ZMSNAZcsA"
bobdylan,35g3u9,arizonabob,3,Sun May 10 03:43:26 2015 UTC,"It is difficult to say what his legacy will be shortly after he dies. People will naturally write grand obituaries, play his music for a few weeks and I think we will see a lot of releases of uncirculated material that he didn't want released during his life. But this happens for any reasonably major artist of our day and Dylan's importance, I think, will be lost amongst this cynical glorification of everyone with an imdb credit.   Dylan's legacy won't be apparent in the decade after his death nor will it be for as long as those of us who have experienced him whilst he was still alive are around.   But once we are all dead and gone, once the sagas of Britney Spears, the excesses of ZZ Top and AC/DC, the meanderings of Joni Mitchell (sorry folks) or the brief flickers of Kurt Cobain are reduced by the weight of history to a footnote of the Encyclopaedia of the 20th Century, then, like for all centuries before that, will we see the ones who really had something to say remain.   I do reckon the Beatles will be treated as our day's Mozart 200 years from now. The Stones might be a Beethoven or perhaps just a Chopin. Dylan, however, will get a different treatment in my opinion, as Dylan isn't just a musician. Dylan is a study in characters, in lives, in poetry. Dylan will be our day's equivalent of Shakespeare, someone to be studied in school and quoted. And it is not something completely unthinkable - I remember my glee in a national English exam, where the main assignment was to analyse a Dylan lyric. And this wasn't a popular song - this was something that had only been circulating on bootleg.   And I think we will see more of that once those of us who remember him are dead, same as Mozart or Shakespeare only really gained in popularity once their contemporaries perished.   Not too long ago, I spoke to a prominent taper of Dylan's shows about his motivations. Surprisingly enough, he admitted that he didn't even consider himself a Dylan fan. I was puzzled, but then he upped his game: he said that, as ridiculous as it may sound, he considered himself an apostle. He didn't really care about his own relationship with Dylan: his goal was to preserve as much as possible of Dylan's career as a performing artist, not for himself, but for posterity. He felt Dylan will be far more appreciated in the future than he is now and he didn't want the people of the future to miss out on Dylan's live shows.   I am not quite sure I can necessarily endorse it in such glowing terms, however, I do think his legacy will be greater than what we may credit him with."
bobdylan,35g3u9,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Sun May 10 21:02:23 2015 UTC,"This is such a great question but also such a difficult one. I think that without doubt Bobby will go down as one of the 'greats' along with Elvis and the Beatles etc. and I think in that regard he'll go down as the great songwriter of 20th century popular music.  For me those are the certainties, that and his 60s image as 'leader of the generation' and 'counter culture' prince, but aside from that I think it's incredibly difficult to know what history will hold on to and choose to look back on. I mean of course, history will always hold onto his music, but whether people in 50 years time will solely be revering his 60s output, or listening to Planet Waves or Knocked Out Loaded that remains to be seen."

bobdylan,354krt,ilikepieman,6,Thu May 7 01:31:03 2015 UTC,"For me, Dylan is an ever changing phenomenon. Like all music, it depends what mood I'm in when I decide what to listen to, but that lasts for a few hours or a day and a half. With Dylan's music, I get in the mood for one of his albums, and I stay there for up to a couple of weeks. Whether I want to listen to ""Sara"", and then listen to Desire on shuffle for a week, or do the same with Highway 61 Revisited after I listen to ""Tombstone Blues"". I can never pinpoint my favorite song for more than a day or two, because then it changes. I have a list of top 10, but even that can change over time and then revert back. His music speaks to everyone differently and to the same person different ways at different times. Every time I start listening to a different album, the songs hit me a different way because of what's gone on since the last time. Somehow his music can be used for any situation and the lyrics are almost always applicable. That's what he is to me, even if that didn't make much sense."
bobdylan,354krt,Snoop_Dogg_Attending,2,Thu May 7 01:53:59 2015 UTC,"""I can never pinpoint my favorite song for more than a day or two, because then it changes."" This is really true, I move around a lot as well. I went from being rather bored by Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands (it's just 11 minutes of the same pattern over and over) to being completely entranced by the sort of dark mysticism in it, though I have no idea what changed or where the feeling comes from. I find I go back and forth a lot more on the electric albums (Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues has always been one of my favorites, though sometimes I'll listen to it and not get that feeling at all) than I do on the acoustic ones-I've never listened to Hattie Carroll and not felt the message, but sometimes I'll listen to Memphis Blues Again and feel like it's just a bunch of random sentences strung together. Sometimes I like a song so much that the next time I listen to it my perspective has shifted and I keep unconsciously looking for some grand message behind it."

That happened to me with a few songs on Highway 61 Revisited like From a Buick 6 and It Takes a Train.  I always skipped them but now they're some of my favorite songs.  It's weird because it happens with so many of his songs.

I mean if you or me would be called the voice of the generation we would probably keep on doing that stuff even though we can't stand it anymore, because we wanna be loved by people. But Dylan?

That legacy is made even stronger by the fact that he refuses to tell what his songs are about (or if they're really about anything). This allows everyone to take their own meaning from his songs, which is what people do anyway. But with Dylan, unlike other musicians, the meaning you take from it is the meaning.

bobdylan,352l1k,solarandlunar,2,Wed May 6 19:31:06 2015 UTC,"I can't wrap my mind around this. Kings of Leon went from seriously awesome to shit by turning pop; Dylan went from seriously awesome to even more awesome by going electric. But M&S were never seriously awesome, and have now gone from pop to electric pop. Where does that leave them? I am confused.  I mean, they were so full of shit to begin with...with the outfits and affect and everything. Does it matter? At least Dylan, sincere and authentic or not, definitely SOLD the sincere and authentic thing.  Does it matter much, the music playing in the background while we hear about their relationships and stuff?"

bobdylan,34sg63,thepeachtrees,3,Mon May 4 10:03:46 2015 UTC,Self Portrait has always been like '73 Dylan for me. I like much of it.
bobdylan,34sg63,Mitchull,1 point,Mon May 4 14:34:37 2015 UTC,"The difference is that while Self Portrait was Dylan purposefully doing a bad album, the 1973 Dylan was released without his permission by Columbia after he switched to Asylum Records.

bobdylan,34sg63,Grizzlyhorse,3,Mon May 4 19:09:36 2015 UTC,"I've never really bought the ""I did it on purpose"" thing.  I've always seen it as a genuine attempt at playing music he was into, rather than more of the same rock that he was obviously moving away from but that people wanted to hear.  Yeah he didn't try to make a polished album, but like /u/clean-cut-kid mentioned above there's just too much beauty on this album to believe that Dylan wasn't trying.  I think that's just to protect his cool guy image a little, after the fact, and totally because of its horrible reception."
bobdylan,34sg63,HylianWalrus,1 point,Mon May 4 19:42:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know, man. I might have to respectfully disagree here. There was about a decade and a half when he tried to make serious music and failed. Couldn't he try to make non-serious music and fail at that, meaning he accidentally made good music?"
bobdylan,34sg63,81_iq,1 point,Mon May 4 20:21:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I do believe he purposefully put out a severely weakened album. I don't believe Dylan looked at all the things he was recording and thought the selection that became 'Self Portrait' consisted of the best songs. He had too keen an eye for always getting the right songs and takes and put them on album (it was only during the 1980's that he seemed to lose that ability). I can't believe Dylan honestly felt his abominal rendition of The Boxer was better than Pretty Saro, or that he thought his Blue Moon deserved to be on the album more than Spanish is the Loving Tongue. All the best recordings only surfaced with the Bootleg Series Vol. 10.    In Chronicles, Dylan writes he was throwing all kinds of things at the wall to see what stuck and then picked up the stuff that didn't stick and released it anyway. I know not everything he says in the book can be taken at face value (""Blood On the Tracks had nothing to do with my divorce"") but I find this explanation very plausible, especially if you consider he goes on for more than 10 pages about how fans would drive him crazy at that time.    New Morning, the follow-up, was also started reluctantly, sparked by a request to write songs for an off-Broadway musical. After he pulled out of that, he build on that flimsy foundation and took some songs from the Self Portrait sessions and added them to New Morning. (Check the recording dates on BS Vol. 10.) It was like he was padding until he got enough to get another album. Which, despite all the praise from the critics about ""having Dylan back"", was nothing like he produced in the 60s and not groundbreaking at all. So all that combined makes it look even more like Dylan genuinely wanted to get away from his fanbase.    The material was there, he was recording great stuff. He just deliberately chose to not put that out."
bobdylan,34o1gj,midnitcafe,3,Sat May 2 22:53:44 2015 UTC,"Gopherstick's compilations were amazing. He was a valuable resource back in the early 2000s for finding the best NET shows.

Going to all three myself and also possibly Manchester - depends on what's happening between the 23rd and the 27th. And also on whether there will be variations. I do very much like the static set list, but not 'I'm seeing it 5 times in one week' much.   I'm wondering whether we'll see a smaller town on the 25th or whether they'll do a 4th RAH show, considering the 3rd sold out so quickly."

Wow that's awesome - I'd love to go more than one show, but I'm getting married this year so that's certainty out of the question, but I'm jealous anyway.  And yes, I too like 'the set' as well, though a lot of people don't seem to. Also, I think a few more shows will be added on, I've seen a few rumblings about the possibility of another show on the Saturday, 24th, because that weekend is completely free.

bobdylan,34hg06,SOPA_NO,5,Fri May 1 04:28:28 2015 UTC,"For me, it's the one that started it all...  I was in the car, listening to a generic, classic rock Pandora radio station, when the song came on that I was unfamiliar with. That song turned out to be ""Like a Rolling Stone"". I was so mesmerized by the lyricism and overwhelmed by how much this song captivated me. I've heard this song 100's, if not 1000's of times, and I still love it to death, but nothing will ever top the first time I ever heard it.  Some others for me would have to be: Tangled Up In Blue, Ballad of a Thin Man, When The Ship Comes In, and The Times They Are A-Changin'."

I thought Tangled Up In Blue sounded annoying the first time I heard it. Now I think it's probably the greatest song of all time. I remember the exact moment I 'really' heard it for the first time. I wish I could have that again.   And then there are songs like Like A Rolling Stone, where I would give anything to hear it again for the first time. That song's just supernatural."

Planet Waves, Desire, Blood on the Tracks is probably my favourite of Dylan's ""trilogies"" if only because of how different they are to one another yet how incredible each one is in its own right.  The bass and drums of 'Planet Waves' have never sounded like that in any other song I've ever heard."
bobdylan,34dxcm,solarandlunar,2,Thu Apr 30 13:45:15 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite songs by him. Where can I get an audio copy of this? Is it a bootleg only?

bobdylan,34cfcf,BillyShears17,8,Thu Apr 30 01:01:27 2015 UTC,"One of my favourite Dylan songs, if only for its obscurity. I'm a writer, so the weave he and Levy are able to spin is absolutely incredible. Especially with how he's able to dig the melody out of some words like 'Soviet Ambassador'. Just pure genius.  Plus, it's almost the culmination of the gypsy vibe that he tries to create throughout the whole record. This song and Romance In Durango are amongst my favourites."

bobdylan,34cfcf,SOPA_NO,2,Thu Apr 30 04:31:57 2015 UTC,"That violin, though...!"
bobdylan,34cfcf,solarandlunar,5,Thu Apr 30 04:58:09 2015 UTC,Easily one of my Top 10 favorite Dylan songs. Not to mention one of the many many songs made even better by Emmylou's backing vocals.  Desire as a whole doesn't get talked about as often as it should when discussing great Dylan albums.
bobdylan,34cfcf,TheDanimal438,2,Thu Apr 30 01:27:50 2015 UTC,I never understood that as well. I believe it's a great album but I do tend to skip Joey.
bobdylan,34cfcf,TheDanimal438,1 point,Thu Apr 30 01:51:49 2015 UTC,"I admit that I tend to skip Joey, but every so often I'll sit through it again and am reminded that it's a decent song. I think the album tends to get overlooked because Hurricane is one of those played too often songs from his catalog, Romance and Isis have been trumped by the live Rolling Thunder versions, people tend to skip Joey and Sara is probably too direct and personal of a love song for some people's taste.  Looking at it as an album as a whole though there really is nothing imperfect about it and though we may skip Joey it's not a ""bad"" song. I haven't even mentioned Oh, Sister which is another one of his great love songs and I love how personal of a song Sara is. ""Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel writing Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands for you."" still gives me chills and is possibly the most truthful, personal lyric he's ever put on record."
bobdylan,34cfcf,solarandlunar,2,Thu Apr 30 02:03:13 2015 UTC,"The only reason I ever skip Joey is that it's too damn long. I even sit through the first four minutes because it's actually a great fucking song.  ""Let ConEdison take the blame!""  But like his other longer songs, when I'm in the mood, it's going on."
bobdylan,34cfcf,desolategrunt,2,Thu Apr 30 02:13:53 2015 UTC,I agree all the way. I love the Rolling Thunder era. I agree with the Hurricane statement. I love Isis and Romance in Durango which are great songs. One More Cup is also amazing. The way he sings it is unique.

bobdylan,34a1fl,solarandlunar,5,Wed Apr 29 14:21:10 2015 UTC,"Still today, people who go to see him on stage are expecting to see a guy singing folk songs with his acoustic guitar, like they didnt listen his music since 1964."
bobdylan,34a1fl,Gibolin,3,Wed Apr 29 22:14:54 2015 UTC,"When I saw him in Seattle last fall, I overheard some guys bickering and pissed about how they didn't know any of the songs and that he didn't play [X song] from 1963. All I could do was smirk and walk on. It's like they don't know he's got another 30+ albums."
bobdylan,34a1fl,comancheshower,3,Thu Apr 30 04:13:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when I saw him live for the first time in Amsterdam in 2013, I ran into this guy in his 60s who didn't recognize most of the songs. That night, Bob played almost all songs of Tempest and some other post-2000 songs with only a few 1960s and 1970s songs. I wondered why this guy would come to see Dylan if he stopped following the artist after the 1970's."
bobdylan,34a1fl,woweezowee34,6,Thu Apr 30 12:48:00 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more. It's strange how someone with so much versatility and so much to offer gets boxed into this nasally sounding poet with an acoustic guitar.
bobdylan,34a1fl,easy_lucky_freezing,3,Wed Apr 29 14:50:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly; not only is Dylan only considered a folk singer, he's almost always lumped in with this confessional-type of writing he ardently ran away from early on.   You can hear his vitriol whenever he talks about Blood on the Tracks being a series of love stories instead of straight up confessions on his divorce. The amount of time the dude takes in referencing literature, writing imagery and rewriting to fit the music... I'd be annoyed, too."
bobdylan,34a1fl,Neil_young_freak,4,Wed Apr 29 15:02:40 2015 UTC,"Do you believe Dylan when he says Blood On the Tracks has nothing to do with his divorce from Sara? Because I don't believe him for a minute. There's a reason he left 'Call Letter Blues' off the album at the last minute. He didn't have the heart to put out those lyrics at that time. ""The children cry for mother/ I tell them: mother took a trip"". Why wouldn't he want to put that out if it wasn't deeply personal to him?"
bobdylan,34a1fl,Neil_young_freak,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:35:30 2015 UTC,"I think the word 'about' becomes tricky. I'm sure his divorce highly inspired and shaped his message for the album but the lyrics aren't confessional. 'BOTT' has some of the most fanciful imagery and storytelling he's been able to come up with.  I think the record is more a collection of tales about love and loss that when looked as a whole, present a picture about relationships that isn't necessarily very uplifting, hah. But I don't think it's as 'about' his divorce as people say it is. One can't deny that personal experience informs your art, but when he speaks in the first person in the record, I don't think he really means himself."
bobdylan,34a1fl,Neil_young_freak,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:38:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with you to a large degree, I don't think it's all 'about' Sara and him (especially Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts doesn't make sense in that context), but I do think it was very heavily influenced by it. Moreso than Dylan himself admits. He says it was about Chekov's short stories but that doesn't sound very convincing to me. Certainly, like you said, he used very fanciful imagery in his lyrics that go beyond something as 'basic' as a divorce. They go beyond that. But at the same time, I can't imagine anyone writing lyrics like those in 'Idiot Wind' and singing them with that much fury and venom when it's not about them personally."
bobdylan,34a1fl,pooroldedgar,6,Thu Apr 30 17:17:17 2015 UTC,"Especially considering Highway 61 is one of, if not, his greatest album of all time. (It's my favorite anyway.) I love Folk Dylan but you're right people greatly underestimate the power of Rock Dylan."
bobdylan,34a1fl,kickstand,7,Wed Apr 29 14:54:24 2015 UTC,"The more I understand about him the more I get annoyed that even most fans don't understand the scope of his brilliance, and what his genuine art really is. He has created a myth. A myth as far-reaching and nuanced as the bible. And it would seem as if that was his plan all along.  He isn't as much a musician as he is a sociologist that explores and manipulates narratives, with his own as the center. He's a sculptor, and human history and culture is his clay.   The songs are fantastic, the means are incredible, but he hasn't mis-stepped once in his overall creation. Joni Mitchell wasn't insulting him when she said that he's never done an original thing in his life. She was explaining what he really is and becoming a part of his actual work."
bobdylan,34a1fl,kickstand,10,Wed Apr 29 18:43:13 2015 UTC,"I think he realized early on that there was a separation between man and artists and that he could never live up to the image people had of him. He quickly learned to play with that, to sort create the artist and then he'd create the music, almost. I don't know if I'm being understood right now.  I always remember this one story I had heard; this musician (I've read this a long time ago so the details escape me) was talking about something Dylan had told him when they were in the studio. They were trying to find a groove and Dylan noticed this guy tapping his toes and told him that if you wanna find the rhythm, you have to tap your heels, not your toes. That's where the music is. And you know what? Something so simple can really redefine your entire understanding of music.   Being Latino, this concept was something I had learned intuitively because Latin music, especially Latin dancing is about stepping on the beat with your heels. That's where the core lies.  I'm sure it's like that with a lot of kinds of dancing but that's how I associated it. If you listen to all of Dylan's music, you'll notice that it's all about ""groove"". No matter what genre or style, the one thing that ties Dylan together throughout the years is his attention to groove as the real backbone of the music. It seems almost essential to any song if you think about it, but a lot of musicians, especially these days don't really pay as much attention to groove as they do to melody. I've played some Dylan for people who said he almost sounds like he's rapping; they're absolutely right because the things Dylan pays attention to in his music are the same building blocks of hip-hop. It all stems from the same lineage of music."

This and other albums from the era aren't great musically, but they fit the overall picture very well. I don't know if the announcer still does the intro at his shows like this anymore, but in the early 2000's he was opening with a whole list of Dylan's career moves as recorded by music history before saying ""Ladies and Gentlemen, Columbia recording artist - BOB DYLAN!"" He's a folk actor...and that seemed to be aimed at driving that point home.   The only part of his career for me that doesn't fit that picture is around the time when he played with the Traveling Wilburys.  He really didn't seem to be playing the Dylan character there, rather just another musician in a group."

Two? Three?  But, to be honest, part of why it doesn't bother me is because I don't think it's accurate. I think 'new dylan' does get a lot of credit. He's viewed as an elder statement now, been in an apple commercial, had some of his biggest hits, been awarded the nation's most prestigious civilian award by Obama himself, and topped the Pazz and Jop list 2 or 3 times. You can't get much more appreciated than that."

Or Darwin as an old guy with a long beard, and not the young man who went off to explore on the Beagle.  Come to think of it, I much prefer that people think of Dylan as a young, vital, influential performer, rather than think of him as an old guy."

bobdylan,34a1fl,tanhan27,2,Wed Apr 29 20:09:34 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you, and it's a really good point - I remember when Bright Eyes became really big, and Conor Oberst was referred to as the 'New Dylan', I remember thinking that, although I love Bright Eyes, this chap wasn't the New Dylan, but in fact its just a fairly lazy means of categorising a 'young guy, who can write a good song'.   Part of me also thinks that its simply an easy way of pinning someone like Bob down, when you consider how many different stylistic and personal changes he's made during his career, by referring back to his early folk years - which are synonymous with that portion of the more 'radical 60s' - its simply an easier way of labelling him."

I knew a lot of people who bought it and made it seem like they were huge Dylan fans, but they had never listened to anything from Dylan post 65.

The same is bound to happen with any artist - if you only look at their most popular work, you make an assumption that that work is representative of the whole, which in Dylan's case is false. It's a shame that most people don't think about his other work, (Blonde on Blonde perhaps being the biggest travesty in that regard), but that's just the way it goes. His earlier work is arguably more socially important because it is tied with the civil rights movement; his name is tossed around with MLK and others. In his later work, he became less of a public figure, more elusive, and more indecipherable, and while his music had an enormous impact on his contemporaries, it didn't have the same sense of importance as his earlier work.    And yes that ""New Bob Dylan"" is complete bullshit. We had already had a version of Dylan, his name was Donovan and he wasn't all that special. Nowadays people are inclined to indicate that these new folksy artists are the next ""Bob Dylan"" because they can't sing quite as well as the others and happen to write their own lyrics. Again, it's bullshit. They might be good in their own right, but no one can ever replace somebody like that."
bobdylan,34a1fl,tanhan27,0,Thu Apr 30 06:01:15 2015 UTC,"But it is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the negro poor has worsened over the last twelve or fifteen years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice and humanity.   -The Other America   I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.   -Letter from a Birmingham Jail"

bobdylan,3480ij,BillyShears17,6,Wed Apr 29 02:16:10 2015 UTC,Born In Time  Most of The Time  Make You Feel My Love  Tears of Rage  This Wheels On Fire  I Threw It All Away  Tell Me It Isn't True  And alot lot lot more
bobdylan,3480ij,BillyShears17,3,Wed Apr 29 03:39:50 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of people overlook Make You Feel My Love (maybe they're sick of Adèle getting all the credit?) but if you really let the lyrics sink in, it's one of the finest yet heart-breaking songs Dylan has ever written. I'd say it's deceptively simple; it cuts right to the core. What's remarkable about it, is that the song even holds up in translations. I know of two very beautiful Dutch translations and they really hold up. I think that speaks to the ability of Dylan to express universal feelings in a way that everybody can relate to."
bobdylan,3480ij,Rule56,2,Fri May 1 01:03:04 2015 UTC,"funny thing for me is the first version I heard of that song was by Garth Brooks on his ""Double Live"" album. Here I am as a 7 year old in 1998 singing that song and it would take me until high school to realize it was a Bob Dylan song and I was blown away by it. The reason I don't listen to that song in my car is because, your right, that song is heavily associated with Adele now. It's okay but I hate when people (listeners) take a song and run away with it. My redneck friend prefers the Limp Bizkit version of ""Behind Blue Eyes"" than The Who's version and I look to him like WTF? Can't win 'em all. G&R version of ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"" is one of the worst covers I have ever heard."
bobdylan,3480ij,Tinavicious,2,Fri May 1 01:35:49 2015 UTC,"Happen to have a link for those?  To be clear, the Dutch versions. Not Adele..."
bobdylan,3480ij,Rule56,2,Fri May 1 02:27:34 2015 UTC,"Sure.    This one is from Claudia de Breij, from a much-acclaimed theater show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpMXItUyLco    This is done by Bart Peeters, a Flemish singer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um8OvFO2JHU    They both have the same title but the lyrics are very different. Still, what impresses me is how both artists captured the essence of the song so masterfully. They didn't make a literal translation, sometimes they stray far from the original lyrics. But to me it's obvious they grasped what Dylan wanted to say with the song and that meaning remains intact, even in another language."
bobdylan,3480ij,Tinavicious,4,Fri May 1 10:49:35 2015 UTC,Don't think twice it's alright
bobdylan,3480ij,dudecoolhat,4,Wed Apr 29 01:17:06 2015 UTC,I didn't list that because he doesn't want the girl back in that song. It's alright with him that they've split up and it aint no use crying about it.
bobdylan,3480ij,JohnRegular,8,Wed Apr 29 01:21:45 2015 UTC,There's a few lyrics in that song that kind of made me think otherwise. The songs you picked were spot on though.
bobdylan,3480ij,captain__sock,3,Wed Apr 29 01:40:43 2015 UTC,The explaination on the back of the record sleeve explains it pretty well. I'll see if I can find a picture of it online otherwise I'll take a picture of it tomorrow.
bobdylan,3480ij,t-pat,5,Wed Apr 29 04:08:01 2015 UTC,"""Dylan treats Don't Think Twice, It's All Right differently from most city singers. ""A lot of people,"" he says, ""make it sort of a love song- slow and easy going. But it isn't a love song. It's a statement that maybe you say to yourself to make you feel batter. It's as if you were talking to yourself. I can sing it sometimes, but I ain't that good yet. It's a hard song to sing. I don't carry myself yet the way that Big Joe Williams, Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly and Lightnin' Hopkins have carries themselves. I hope to be able to someday, but they're older people. I sometimes am able to do it, but it happens, when it happens, unconsciously. You see, in time, with these older singers, music was a tool- a way to live more, a way to make themselves feel better in certain points. As for me, I can make myself feel better some times, but at other times, it's still hard to go to sleep at night."""""
bobdylan,3480ij,captain__sock,4,Wed Apr 29 15:34:33 2015 UTC,"He does sound a bit hurt in the last line: ""You just kinda' wasted my precious time"""
bobdylan,3480ij,ObdwellaX,3,Wed Apr 29 02:15:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've always thought of that song as, ""Hey, I'm leaving now! Yep! Leaving! Nothing you can do about it!

See ya!"" all the while hoping she'll come to her senses."

Only 100 vinyl copies were produced - the sole intention of the 50th anniversary collection was to extend copyright in Europe (if they hadn't re-released the songs, they would have become public domain there). If you wanted a CD, it's gonna run you some serious dough; about $120 bucks. here's one.  If you're a true die-hard fan and have $800 bucks lying around, you can get a vinyl copy here. I'm not sure of the authenticity (again, only 100 vinyl released) so you'll have to take a chance. I'm sure there's bootlegs of this thing somewhere out there in the world, and if you don't want to lay some serious cash for some Dylan songs, you could always try a torrent site - I'm almost positive you'll find it on the pirate bay. Happy hunting."

It would be nice to have on a properly released compilation album or something (another bootleg series volume), but this is likely the best we're going to get for a long time."
bobdylan,345p5m,Fourth_Time_Around,9,Tue Apr 28 14:40:23 2015 UTC,"If they're stoners, I'd say to start with Bringing It All Back Home or Highway 61 Revisited.   I've introduced people to Dylan's music starting with Modern Times, too, and they loved it. I wouldn't start off with the folk scene Dylan unless they're into that."

bobdylan,345p5m,ItFrightensMe,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:19:16 2015 UTC,"What got me started was Bringing It All Back Home (specifically Mr Tambourine Man). I'm a fan of folk scene Dylan (first 4 albums), so if they're not into the twangy sound I'd go a little later. Starting with Freewheelin' might push them out because it's a) a product of its time, and b) sounds way more twangy than most people these days like.  I started one of my friends out on Highway 61 Revisited, he absolutely loves Like A Rolling Stone and Tombstone Blues and recently got into Bringing It All Back Home.  Blood On The Tracks is what my other Dylan-loving friend started on (independent of me), his favorite song being Shelter From The Storm."

Lennon further thought the very similar tempo, chord structure and lyrics were mocking NW. As mentioned, the ""crutch"" line was also seen by Lennon as a direct attack."

bobdylan,33jrql,BillyShears17,2,Thu Apr 23 02:09:08 2015 UTC,Context?
bobdylan,33jrql,davy_crockett,5,Thu Apr 23 11:30:12 2015 UTC,"I believe this is from 'Hearts of Fire'; a 1987 film starring Bob Dylan as a washed up Rock-star-turned-chicken-farmer. It's not a very good film, only view-able for the novelty of Dylan's acting. Even then, it's probably not worth sitting through the entire thing. You know what, just pretend this movie never existed, you'd be better off for it."

It's madness; no one managed to get that kind of colour before or since.  It's like someone took the blues and took rocknroll and dipped into the biggest vat of acid they could find.

The way he interacts with the audience, getting more and more fed up as it goes on and finally explodes in one of the best renditions of 'Like A Rolling Stone"". Its magic.

bobdylan,33h138,vansebastian,3,Wed Apr 22 17:50:51 2015 UTC,"It's the ""Bootleg series Vol. 4: Live 1966: 'The Royal Albert Hall' Concert"". It was passed around as a bootleg for a while, but in the 1990s the record label picked it up and started distributing it as part of the bootleg series. Highly interesting, great renditions of all the songs."
bobdylan,33h138,BamaDillert,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:04:33 2015 UTC,This album is on Spotify but there doesn't seem to be any interaction with the audience on that version. Anyone know what's up?
bobdylan,33h138,mehmehmee,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:38:56 2015 UTC,"I should clarify that the audience interaction is minimal and only really appears on the second half of the album - the electric half. And even then it's usually just the audience booing and clapping when Dylan is trying to introduce songs. The worst it ever gets is when someone from the audience shouts 'Judas' and Dylan says ""I don't believe, you're a liar"" and then someone else in the band says ""play it fucking loud"" before they start 'Like a Rolling Stone'. But again, mostly just booing and shouting before the songs start, then once the band starts to play, they're all silent.  It's possible that the spotify version just cuts out those parts in between songs - sometimes theres up to a minute of just Dylan tuning his guitar or the band getting ready. The version I have is just a continuous recording of the concert, the only cut in the album seems to be in the middle, where Dylan switches from acoustic to electric. If you want, I can set up a dropbox account and give you access to it so you can download the version I have from there."
bobdylan,33h138,BamaDillert,2,Wed Apr 22 19:06:44 2015 UTC,"That is 100% Bob telling The Band to ""Play fucking loud!""  My favorite bit of fan interaction is when Bob starts mumbling nonsense under their obnoxious clapping until they all stop to hear what he's saying ""...mumblemumblemumble if you only just wouldn't clap so hard."""
bobdylan,33h138,MaximumDestruction,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:29:16 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to start an argument but that is most certainly not Bob Dylan - if you watch the video of the incident, you see Dylan seem to mouth the words. This was an editing mistake; in the documentary which the footage appears, the footage is wrongly synced with that audio.   For one the voice is accented (play it fookin' loud) could be Robbie Robertson (I think that's his name), and sounds almost too deep to be Dylan. And second, it would have been louder if it was Dylan, as he's closer to the microphone - in the video he says it directly into the microphone, which doesn't make sense because it's not amplified. To my recollection none of the other band members had vocals on the songs, so no microphones, which is why the Audio is slightly more faint than when Dylan says ""You're a liar, etc"". I do wish it was him who said so because it's badass, but I don't think that's the case."
bobdylan,33h138,BamaDillert,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:39:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure which video you are referring to if its this one then yeah, looks like its not from that same show.  Anyway, I think its ""I don't believe you...You're a liar!"" before turning away from the audience and the mic to tell The Band ""play fucking loud!""   There was a documentary I remember from the 90's that had some different footage of this moment that looked like the actual Manchester show.  There was also an interview from one of the members of The Band (I think it was Robbie Robertson) saying how Bob was pissed and said to ""play fucking loud.""  This is probably my favorite Dylan release of all time and have heard it many, many times.  I would bet hundreds of dollars that is Dylan being a badass and telling what was, at that point, his backing band how he wanted the song performed: loud enough to piss off these asshole folkies."
bobdylan,33h138,MaximumDestruction,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:16:32 2015 UTC,"Huh. I thought he said it into the microphone, but I guess that doesn't make any sense. I guess it could have been Dylan who said it. I still have my doubts, but I suppose there's a very good chance it was him."

Certainly, a '66 DVD is much more likely than a '75 one, as most of the latter footage was (allegedly) accidentally destroyed.

There's a really good mix of content in the shows, with lots of great songs to look forward to. My favorite album has always been Blood on The Tracks, and he sings 2 from there.

As long as you are going there to see Dylan and not a tribute act performing the 'hits', it would be a great shame if you missed the opportunity to see present day Dylan."

Obviously his voice isn't what it was but damn he makes good use of what he has now. He still can play the hermonica incredibly well, so get ready for that. He didn't play the guitar at all during his performance but it didn't bother me.   He went back and forth from standing to sitting playing the piano. He didn't speak to much to audience but saying thanks before heading off for a quick intermission break. He is who he is and I respect that.   Like others said, he goes from one song to the other without saying really anything and then leaves when it's all over. I didnt care at all, I got to seeing fucking Bob Dylan!"

bobdylan,33ffj5,mitch172,1 point,Sun Apr 26 01:18:52 2015 UTC,"I saw him four or five years ago when he came to Winnipeg. I had just started really getting into his work, though not much used to anything after his voice really changes. Seeing him live was great just to know it was Dylan up on that stage, but the voice was kind of a bummer. It was kind of upsetting knowing that he had been touring for so long, continues to tour, and how can he possibly muster the energy and passion to make it a worthwhile performance for an audience to see.   As I grew up and continued to immerse myself in the man's work, I remembered that this is what he's always done and always loved to do - why would it be any different now? Surely he's enjoying himself at least as much as (if not more than) he did back when people would heckle him just for changing his tune. He can be sure that the people seeing him love the music."
bobdylan,33dpxt,pike360,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:14:32 2015 UTC,"That's a fantastic version.  What a voice and really caught the feel to that song. Unfortunately only 3 of the 5 verses though.    Really impressed how she gets through the ""fish truck unloads"" portion of the last verse.  That isn't an easy cadence to get.  Anybody know what the guitar is tuned to?  I kind of like how the guitarist keeps hitting the bass note, wonder if it is drop D or something."

He was freaky to me...because I still believe that he’s the only prophet we’ve had since Jesus. I don’t think people are gonna realize it for another two or three hundred years when they figure out who really did help stop the Vietnam War, who did change everybody around and why our children aren’t hiding under the damn tables now worrying about an atomic war. One day they’ll wake up–and they’ll realize what they had–instead of asking what kind of album he did and is it as good as the last one. That was always bullshit to me."" http://www.b-dylan.com/pages/samples/bobjohnston.html"

I remember hearing it for the first time, after having been familiar with 'Tight Connection to my Heart' and thinking: ""this song is so goddamn perfect, why did he have to tinker with it so much?"" Just as he did with 'When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky', he took a great song and messed with it until it became much less stellar than how it started out.    I still get goosebumps every time I hear: ""You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that I desire/ But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire"""

I came across one of her songs and the distorted guitar in the beginning reminded me of neil young's guitar playing for some reason, the sound is just familiar, and the song is a great listen. Here's a link, last kind words.  *And she does a phenomenal cover of Odetta's waterboy, I thought you guys might get a kick out of her live performance on letterman, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHnh8_8Cx7E, he was pretty much blown away, for good reason. She has such a great stage presence, and the backing band is great, when she whispers 'you jack of diamonds' around the 1:30 mark, and the music kicks in, man, it's something. Can music have swagger? Because man, that's exactly how it sounded like."

My wife's grandfather was a bricklayer at the University at the time of the rioting. He said he was terrified because people were picking up his bricks and throwing them.

Two people did die and it wasn't properly documented but I do not have a proper link for you to cite that for information. If I'm not mistaken it was two white people who were killed in the rioting unintentionally by the rioters. I could be wrong though."

bobdylan,325p0r,nostrilz,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:50:39 2015 UTC,"Nice to hear the original!! It's pretty cool that the Old Crow Medicine Show guy heard this and thought to write the rest of the song.   And the old crow version really is so great. They really nailed it out of the park writing the verses and they nail the performance on the recording too. It's basically become a bluegrass standard in 15 years. I think it's a standard the same way ""somewhere over the rainbow"" is a ukulele standard now. It's just so popular that most bluegrass bands will give a groan when it's requested.   I loathe the Darius Rucker version. It adds the standard empty country drums to help out a less lively performance, reduces the harmony parts, and adds nothing to old crow's melody at all except an inferior singer.   It's nice to hear the root performance again, and feel so lucky somebody was recording and that bootleg circulated enough to to find hands that could finish it."

bobdylan,321akc,FizzPig,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"I always liked the titles much more than the covers. Some of them sound really great, even when the albums themselves may not be all that good. I just like the sound of titles like 'Empire Burlesque', 'Knocked Out Loaded', 'Together Through Life', 'Blood On the Tracks', 'Shot of Love' etc.    Now when it comes to covers, it's hard to pick a favorite and a least favorite. He has had some very ugly ones, which I all hate for vastly different reasons. I think he looks ridiculous on the cover of 'Empire Burlesque' and the entire design around it is almost a parody of the 1980's, it looks terrible.    'Tempest' has one that seems totally ""off"" to me. Just doesn't look like a Dylan record. I don't like the font and everything about it seems just lazy and uninspired. Just like the one for 'New Morning' is uninspired, but at least it's not ugly, rather just mediocre.    The absolute worst has to be 'Knocked Out Loaded'. I was going to say 'Self Portrait', but KOL is definitly the ugliest of them all.    The best one is probably 'Bringing It All Back Home'."

It just seems crazy to me. Instead, I'll probably just print out this one and hang it because anything over $50 is simply (IMHO) unfair. The song's something of a bohemian anthem to me, and as a guy who is himself an artist living a bohemian life, I could never afford that. Is there something I don't understand about the material, printing process, etc.? I'm not so convinced of the 'hundreds of hours of research' done, though I do consider it quality work.

This is something someone spent time on. If you want art that costs $50 you can get dogs playing poker. Less than $200 for this is a fair price."
bobdylan,31o99a,comancheshower,0,Tue Apr 7 19:35:36 2015 UTC,"That, ""This is something someone spent time on"" argument is so repellent to me. I'm a few months from finishing my first fiction novel. As of today, I've spent fourteen months of my life on it. I quit my job to write full-time and have been pinching pennies. I sacrificed my long-term relationship and so much more. Squalor and all that. I could never imagine charging more than $20 for a copy of my book, and if I have my way with whichever publishing house I end up working with, considering their costs, I hope the thing is as low as $15, i.e., affordable. It's almost 200,000 words, and in no way fluffy. Yeah, they are different mediums that typically have different running prices—but if I were a painter instead, I'd have the same mentality. You'll move more if it's affordable, anyway. I don't know, man, it seems as though you're saying 'real' art is expensive, and populist dribble like the dogs playing poker can be affordable, but this is why common people can't collect painted/drawn/whatever visual 'art,' and why, in that respect, painted visual art remains elitist in an age in which a person with a common salary, by means of the internet, can possibly be more of an admirer, and more studied and intellectual than wealthy collectors, yet incapable of owning prints of their favorite pieces, not arguing the piece itself, mind you. In addition, records, books, films, and TV series often have far more time spent on them, and in the end are sold at fair price, while satisfying a far greater number of employees, or 'artists.' I understand some of these get funding to complete the work, but quite often bands, writers, and films do not and have to do the whole independent thing. While static mediums like this painting can have a lasting resonant value, I would argue all other formats I've listed often offer the interpreter far more, though in its way, a static piece has its enduring merits as decoration in a home. I promise my book takes you farther places than this painting does. Hell, I think Dylan's song does just that—and guess what? The song's probably a buck online. If it were the original, sure, sell it for thousands of dollars—but a print? Almost $200? No way. This weekend, I hung four picture ledges on my wall so that I can display my favorite records, swap 'em out when I feel, etc. Art you already own, right? A record is half the size of this piece, often features great art printed well, and you have a vinyl disc with which to enjoy the sonic side of the art. Some bands spend two, three, ten years on a single album! And almost none are more than $50 unless you're talking collectables. This painting's price just pushes it further into obscurity. Maybe that was the artist's hope, that only a couple hundred sell to serious fanatics who appreciate the piece enough to dish out the dough so that it remains tasteful somehow, unlike certain Pink Floyd posters or something that are in every other kid's bedroom. Considering all this, I still don't agree to the price. Got any other argument for this curmudgeon?"
bobdylan,31o99a,LarryHolmes,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:06:46 2015 UTC,"The price correlates to the rarity of the skill and the rarity of the physical product.   Growing up in the US public school system, I had reading, spelling, and writing classes 5 times a week, and also used those skills in social studies, math, and, here's the big one-talking to people everyday all day. I had art class once a week for a total of less than an hour until high school, when I then had 49 minutes a day. This is how the vast majority of people are educated-in fact most have even less exposure to art classes than I had-and because of this, painting and drawing are scarce skills, and hence worth more.  If you need a good birthday clown, you might have to do some searching but eventually you will find somebody for a reasonable price. If you need a good tax attorney, it will cost you significantly more money because there are less good tax attorneys than there are good birthday clowns. I am not comparing what you do to being a clown, but it is a job that does require unique skills that not everyone possesses, but there are still many more of them than there are good tax attorneys.  How about the price of materials? Paint and canvas is expensive, while I'm pretty sure every writer would own a computer whether they were writing a novel or not. I am not a novelist and I own two.  A print of an artwork is obviously less expensive to make than creating an original piece, but the physical product is still more expensive than creating a physical copy of a book. This is to say nothing of copying an ebook, which is nothing, unless you want to figure out in pennies how much hard drive space it takes up for the seller.  An artist will always sell fewer prints of a painting than an author will sell of a book. This is because paintings are hung on walls and anyone can see them. I don't need to buy the painting in my doctor's waiting room because I can see it there, but I might want to buy the book my doctor is reading. I definitely have read books recommended to me by friends, while I have never seen wall art in a friend's house and then purchased it for my own house.  This means if something is, by nature, more rare, and the demand is the same, the more rare thing would be worth more.  I don't think that authors are less wealthy than painters, sculptors, photographers, or other types of artists, in fact it's probably the opposite, as there are more book readers than art collectors. As for individual copies of the media in question, it's the rarity of the skill and the relative rarity of the physical product that sets the price. It's supply and demand."

bobdylan,31k0pj,nostrilz,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:14:27 2015 UTC,"Hey Folks: My name is Andy Hill and I'm one of the producers of Dylanfest, being mentioned here. I want to address the concern over ""HailCorporate"", a phrase I am unfamiliar with, but which I think I follow the gist of. First thanks to ThinWildMercury for exercising discretion in his words so as not to completely write off the event while expressing his concern.     Here's the deal: We've been running this Dylanfest for 25 years as a grassroots operation, and this is the first year we asked fans to communicate to Dylan fans on social media. We really believe if Dylan fans knew about it, they would come and enjoy it. This site fits the profile. We don't mean to offend in any way, but we don't know a better way to contact you.   I guess our question is: Does an 8-hour festival of over 60 live Bob Dylan songs performed by about 70 musicians, bands and singers seem like a fun and unusual event? If not here, where is the appropriate place to talk about it?   My reasoning in asking our folks to reach out was that as more ardent than average Dylan fans, (as I am), it seems that this site might be exactly where members would go to hear about this stuff.  Again, it is not our intent to offend, just to inform in good faith! Please check our website if you have suspicions. www.andyandrenee.com.  We are a totally grassroots operation out of Southern California with no corporate affiliations. Dylanfest is only one of (but our favorite and THE longest running) the many musical projects we produce. We won't contact you about Neil Young, Van Morrison, Woodstock or The Last Waltz!  If anyone has any particular questions about Dylanfest, (or with suggestions as to how we might better get the word out), please feel free to contact me directly at andyhillmusic@hotmail.com.   Keep on keepin' on! Andy"

I wonder if Dylan is too loose to accomplish something like what Johnny Cash and Rick Rubin did. From what I understand, Cash really trusted Rubin to guide those sessions and bring him songs he may have never heard or considered recording. Would Dylan, at this late stage, be able to relinquish control over the sessions to someone else's vision?   I personally hope we get something like that or maybe something like the most recent Pops Staples album where Jeff Tweedy took old, unreleased recordings and stripped and re-purposed them into something really raw and special."

bobdylan,30ppg6,gwmercure,2,Mon Mar 30 14:06:39 2015 UTC,"Considering Dylan called these albums ""notorious low-grade stuff,"" I don't think he has a whole lot of respect for Rubin's process."
bobdylan,30ppg6,litewo,2,Thu Apr 2 00:01:23 2015 UTC,"Man, I really wish Neil Young would do this, too.  But he would never let another producer tell him that a song he wrote is a piece of shit that needs to be better before getting recorded.  BTW, Rubin also did great work with Donovan and Neil Diamond as well.  It's brilliant what he can pull out of these guys so far past their ""prime."""

And in the end that album sounded like Young just came over his house in the middle of the night to take a dump on his floor and leave.    Jack White came closer, if not only because that wasn't Neil writing hasty new material.    Tweedy can do this! Thanks for passing that on and giving me something to dream about."

bobdylan,30ppg6,Neil_young_freak,1 point,Tue Mar 31 04:02:21 2015 UTC,"I think Dylan duets work when he respects the person he's singing so much, that he reins in his own idiosyncracies. For example, in the excellent duet he did with Ralph Stanley, he practically plays the straight man: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ho3wlCUydAU  The problem is, I think the only people he respects enough to do that for are mostly older than him, meaning they're mostly dead.  Though I would definitely love to see Dylan let Rick Rubin produce him. A Jack White-produced Dylan album would probably be pretty cool too."

bobdylan,30i3ab,Mitchull,2,Sun Mar 29 17:07:02 2015 UTC,A few I like:  Hamilton Camp does an album with 4 or 5 Dylan songs.  This was mid 60's so early to be giving that much of an album to Dylan.  Road Songs by Townes Van Zandt.  I wish this would come out on vinyl. It's full of good songs and includes Gambling Willie and God Gave Name to the Animals.  It is all covers and includes the version of Dead Flowers that turned up on The Big Lebowski soundtrack.  My favorite  of all Dylan covers is Masked and Anonymous soundtrack.  Oh another cool one I just thought of is Mary Lee Corvettes covering Blood On the Tracks live.

bobdylan,302diu,RobbieBulsara,8,Mon Mar 23 22:32:09 2015 UTC,"So so many. I think both the New York 'open E' Idiot Wind as well as the Rolling Thunder #2 version of the song are superior to the studio take. Both far more personal, albeit in such opposing ways: whilst the New York sessions take is almost pleading, the live version is drowning in bitterness.   Then there's the extra verse from the Shelter From The Storm outtake:    Now the bonds are broken, but they can be retired  By one more journey to the woods, the holes where spirits hide  It's a never ending battle for a peace that's always torn  ""Come in"", she said, ""I'll give ya shelter from the storm""   The Rolling Thunder #2 If You See Her, Say Hello is also interesting, but that one is a bit too vicious for my taste.   Probably the most notable re-write is Tangled Up In Blue, which always seems to change. The 1984 version, however, is I think the most significant re-write and one that also sheds a lot of light on what the song is (probably) actually about.   My favourite though would have to be the various small changes of Simple Twist of Fate. I have a very weak spot for this song, but it never ceases to amaze me how small changes here and there can create a whole new atmosphere and experience. Take the most recent change: the addition of 'wedding' in the ""but I lost the [wedding] ring"" - takes the whole story from a naïve chance encounter to something much more involved and painful."

Similarly, he has reworded ""If You See Her Say Hello"" to be less heartbreaking and more of a ""see ya, nice knowin' ya"" type of song."

My head says that it's time to make a change But my heart is telling me I love ya but you're strange.   Great stuff!  Tangled Up In Blue is perhaps the song he's changed the verses of most in his career, i reckon the 1975 RTR version is my favorite incarnation."

bobdylan,2zwcr5,TheDanimal438,16,Sun Mar 22 12:31:40 2015 UTC,"Objectively, this is quite possibly Bob's greatest album - take all these songs on a song by song basis and you can barely understand how awesome they all are in their own way.   The quick draw lyrical brilliance of Subterranean, the incredible longing nature of She Belongs and Love Minus Zero, the fucking genius of Mr Tambourine Man and It's Alright Ma, and the ending of Baby Blue is just incredible.   I think Bruce Springsteen said that when he heard like a Rolling Stone it was like the door of your mind being kicked open, well this album runs riot in your mind.  Take Mr Tambourine Man; 'Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves Let me forget about today until tomorrow.' - this verse kills me every time."

bobdylan,2zwcr5,Odnoen,2,Mon Mar 23 01:04:43 2015 UTC,"That verse is one of my all time favorites in Bob's catalog. Instantly takes me somewhere else, every single time I hear it."
bobdylan,2zwcr5,TenderFiddles,7,Mon Mar 23 01:55:56 2015 UTC,"Subjectively, I like it quite a bit, but it's not my favorite. It has a nice mix of acoustic and electric songs on it. It's got some of his most classic and popular songs on it and I think a nice hidden gem on it is ""Bob Dylan's 115th Dream""."
bobdylan,2zwcr5,Bonzai1442,4,Sun Mar 22 12:40:10 2015 UTC,"Objectively I would say it's a close second to Blonde on Blonde as his ""best"" album.  Is it my personal favorite? Yes, it just might be. I was already familiar with Bob's more popular radio songs when I really started getting into his music and It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding) was the song where I got it and became a lifelong fan. Aside from  3 of the songs in the middle the rest of the songs on here are some of the greatest songs written by him or anyone for that matter in the history of music.  Favorite track: It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding). Those lyrics still hold more true than ever 50 years after being written. ""It's easy to see without looking too far that not much is really sacred.""  Least favorite track: On the Road Again. Not a bad song, but more of a throwaway song if anything."
bobdylan,2zwcr5,qrtrp,2,Sun Mar 22 13:09:46 2015 UTC,"I think I would agree that Blonde on Blonde might be his ''best'', even if I feel like for Dylan it's more a tier list of best to not so good than a straight up list. It's too hard to compare all his albums to each other. As for bring it all back home I think I love it as much as Blonde on Blonde, every song is pretty good and there are some that are just some of his best writing. I think my favorite track would probably be Baby Blue, Bob Dylan's 115th Dream being close second because I just love how he tells a story as the main character."
bobdylan,2zwcr5,agrice,4,Mon Mar 23 00:06:36 2015 UTC,I may look like Robert Ford but I feel just like a Jesse James.
bobdylan,2zwcr5,grahamlester,2,Mon Mar 23 01:15:31 2015 UTC,Not his best but perhaps his most important because it's the album where he goes electric and where he wholeheartedly embraces poetic quasi-surrealist lyrics. I think the acoustic side is easily the most consciously poetic run of songs in Dylan's catalogue.
bobdylan,2zwcr5,poetYH92,3,Sun Mar 22 13:11:40 2015 UTC,"Man, this album is a lyrical tour de force. Mr. Tambourine Man, It's Alright Ma, and Subterranean Homesick Blues especially. Not to mention the timelessness and influence these songs proved to have over the past few decades.  I usually find myself disappointed about certain outtakes not being included in albums, but it seems like Bob made the right call on these.  Not that they're not great songs. They just wouldn't fit well in this album."

bobdylan,2zwcr5,fuuured,3,Sun Mar 22 13:15:54 2015 UTC,"I really love this album, it's my second favourite, after The Times are a-Changin'. Subterranean Homesick Blues, She Belongs to Me, Love Minus Zero and It's Alright Ma are my favourites from this, but it's a great album all around. Although I do prefer the Bootleg Series 6 version of Gates of Eden to the album version."
bobdylan,2zwcr5,showbizkid,3,Sun Mar 22 17:35:44 2015 UTC,Nine masterpieces and two rockers on this album...
bobdylan,2zwcr5,nostrilz,3,Mon Mar 23 03:46:41 2015 UTC,"I'm in the minority in that Mr. Tambourine Man is a track I always skip. And then I'm probably further in the minority in that I only sometimes like Love Minus Zero and Gates of Eden. But the rest of the album is pretty consistently great, including the outtakes. I've never heard You Don't Have to Do That, but I'd like to do that."
bobdylan,2zwcr5,DylanFloyd,1 point,Mon Mar 23 15:19:02 2015 UTC,"Yea, I can readily admit to skipping Mr. Tambourine Man, but every once in a while I'll sit down and listen to it and I'm reminded how deep and poetic the lyrics are."
bobdylan,2zwcr5,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Mon Mar 23 17:26:09 2015 UTC,"Amazing.  It was the first record of his I heard.  The half acoustic, half electric dynamic.  The opening Subterranean Homesick Blues.  The love songs (She Belongs to me and Love Minus Zero). The bizarreness of Gates of Eden.  The hilarity of 115th Dream.  The 3rd verse of Mr Tambourine Man.  And, of course, the sheer stark brilliance of Baby Blue and It's Alright Ma.  I was hooked immediately."
bobdylan,2zwcr5,ThinWildMercury1,2,Mon Mar 23 01:37:02 2015 UTC,"Objectively is it Bob's best album?  Hard to tell what is objectively his best album as it is difficult to define 'best'. Most significant of his career as a popular music artist? Most important of his albums in terms of its impact on the music scene? Probably yes to both. His greatest achievement as a song-writer? I would say no to that - there are plenty of albums that came afterwards where I think his achievement is greater, although few of them are as universally accessible as this one.   That is not to say it isn't a good album - Tambourine Man, It's Alright, Ma and even Baby Blue are amongst the most potent songs he has ever written.   Subjectively is it your favorite Bob album?  No. Not even in my top 5. Pre-1967 Dylan just doesn't do it for me as much as later Bob.   Favorite/least favorite track?  Hard one. I think It's Alright, Ma is the best track, but it is a hard one to listen to. Favourite would have to be Tambourine Man. Least favourite... Subterranean Homesick Blues. I'm sorry."
bobdylan,2zwcr5,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Mon Mar 23 12:10:58 2015 UTC,"Subterranean Homesick Blues least favorite? Interesting choice, I (and I reckon most Dylan fans) love that tune, whole bunch of great one liners and just generally pretty pioneering musically and in the idea of a music video."
bobdylan,2zwcr5,ThinWildMercury1,2,Mon Mar 23 17:29:42 2015 UTC,"Pioneering - exactly. That is exactly what it is. But pioneering implies 'first', not necessarily 'best' and this is where I have to divorce importance from quality.   I feel people attach a lot of significance to SHB in particular - it certainly is a pivotal moment in Dylan's career and one of the milestones of Western popular music in the 1960s.   But do many people remember the first 'talking' film? The first film to feature a 'The End' at the end or the first film to be filmed in colour? Most people probably don't, even though all of those have been pioneering pictures.   I went to a pub today (and stayed for far too long, but that is another story) and even though I go there once every fortnight or so, today took me by surprise for when I came in they put Dylan on. Album by album, chronologically, starting with Freewheelin'. I was taken back, but it was interesting. I rarely hear Dylan in public settings - to me, listening to Dylan is a rather private thing. At any rate, the albums come and go and Highway 61 Revisited comes on. And I just kept thinking ""Blimey, some of these songs are absolutely magnificent but, my God, it's such a shouty album!"" And it is. Blonde on Blonde was better, Wesley Harding was great and midway through Nashville Skyline, someone shouted ""Turn that fucking noise off!"" and they stopped and put Lana Del Rey on. But I digress.   Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 are very important albums - for Dylan as a musician and for popular music as a whole. But that doesn't mean they are untouchable. SBH has a great video - but that is irrelevant to its musical quality. SBH has a great sound, but it's no different from the Strokes or Arctic Monkeys. As far as 'one chord songs' go, I prefer Tomorrow Never Knows, which came out the year after - it is a much more complex and satisfying approach to the concept. And lyrics? Sure, there are some catchy couplets, but what is the song actually about? What is it trying to say? What does it say to you?   I ask myself that and I can't come up with an answer. Give me a line that even comes close to the quality of ""The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on"" or ""Behind every beautiful thing, there's been some kind of pain"" or even ""Money doesn't talk, it swears"" from the same album.   This is my problem with the entire 60s 'electric trilogy': it isn't about much. In of itself, that is. Sure, it is a statement against the tides of culture and society, but as actual songs, there's not a lot to them. A lot of it is sub-conscious coupling of phrases that you can't quite explain but that sound good together (I'm being a bit harsh on Blonde on Blonde and individual songs of these albums, but the overall point I stand by). That is not to say it wasn't revolutionary - it absolutely was, but the reputation clouds artistic merit. I completely agree with Lennon in his assessment of 60s electric Dylan: it's not about what Dylan sings, it's about how he sings it. But here's the thing: I like to like what he sings. It usually is quite challenging stuff. BIABH and H61 in particular though are albums when Dylan says the least in the most amount of words.   I suppose what I'm trying to say is this: BIABH and H61 are popular music and at that they are very good. But later Dylan, I feel, adds the element of poetry, an element of himself. Later Dylan adds as opposed to defrocks - builds as opposed to destroys. Later Dylan puts himself on the line - be it with Nashville Skyline, Blood on the Tracks, the religious lot or the Christmas album.   SHB epitomises the whole concept of BIABH and H61 for me. It is a song that has altered how music was made. Great. But what came afterwards is the person who made that revolutionary song getting older, learning the lessons of life and reflecting on them. And that, to me, is much more satisfying than watching a young Bob flip cards with words on them in front of a scaffolded Dorchester.   I'm not in a state, I fear, to accurately communicate how I feel about SHB, but hopefully this rather extended post explains things at least a little bit. To be honest, Outlaw Blues is probably a song I rate much less than SBH, but it is the mythology of SHB that to me makes it far more grating than any other song on the album."
bobdylan,2zwcr5,hypnotist-collector,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:39:06 2015 UTC,"You must have been in the pub a while to get through all those albums!  Wish I went to more pubs that played Dylan's discography...  On some of the points you raise:   Give me a line that even comes close to the quality of ""The only thing I knew how to do was to keep on keeping on"" or ""Behind every beautiful thing, there's been some kind of pain"" or even ""Money doesn't talk, it swears"" from the same album.    I've always liked the line: ""Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters""- it's just a simple yet brilliant quip about authority, with something as mondane but symbolic as parking meters being used as a measure with which one can see how much authority is creeping into public life, at least its my reading.  ""20 years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift"" is another, very much sums up the potential one builds up throughout education that is so often wasted in some meaningless job, which brings me onto another point:   What is it trying to say? What does it say to you?    The songs instructions on life.  Done in a comedic fashion, I think it's a kind of guide to some of the banalities and absurdities one encounters in life, played in a fast paced and rather hectic fashion- somewhat like life itself.   SBH has a great sound, but it's no different from the Strokes or Arctic Monkeys   Bareing in mind SHB came many decades before either of them had formed and that it is still being played far more than the majority of either of those bands songs I think this says a lot as to its quality when compared to their songs (not that they're bad bands).  But hey, 'to each his own, it's all unknown...'"
bobdylan,2zwcr5,Kodlin,2,Mon Mar 23 23:43:37 2015 UTC,"Probably my favourite album of all time. The riff as Subterranean kicks in lets you know it's gonna be great! Also there's a good mix of slower/love songs (She Belongs to Me and Love Minus Zero) and fast ones (Maggie's Farm, Subterranean and Outlaw). Great variation so it doesn't get repetitive.   IMHO best track: It's All Over Now, Baby Blue (watch the hotel scene with Donovan from Don't Look Back), least favourite: Gates of Eden. I know the lyrics/imagery are superb but it just makes me tired for some reason! For anyone who hasn't heard them, the outtakes (especially Farewell Angelina) are definitely worth a listen. I think they're mostly on Bootleg Series 1-3."

The artists and producers seemed to execute their mission with reverence towards Dylan and his genius. I appreciated that.

Can't really articulate why though."

bobdylan,2zylp1,solarandlunar,2,Mon Mar 23 15:29:41 2015 UTC,"I think being a purist about the 'Dylan' aspect of this project is a little unfair to the music. There are incredible tracks on there. 'Nothing To It', 'Spanish Mary', 'The Whistle Is Blowing'. I'm a BIG fan of the record.   There are some duds, it's a 20-song record, after all, but there are really great moments, too. 'Stranger' and 'Liberty Street' and 'Down On the Bottom' - the latter of which being the closest anyone gets to channeling Dylan's voice.   You oughta watch the documentary on it, it's very illuminating as to the ins and outs everyone went through. Writing, rehearsing and recording a record in two weeks with people you've never met before is insanity and these guys brought out really quirky and charming music. 'When I Get My Hands On You' is so catchy in its simplicity.  Obviously, the music isn't for everyone but it's a great experiment and a great story and we should encourage interesting music making like this and not get hung up that it doesn't sound like our idea of what a 'Dylan' song should sound like."

Watching the four performances the opened that video, I was possessed by the fleeting thought that he should have stuck with it. Of course, given the enormity and brilliance of some of the music since Saved, I know better. But damn, another album like STC wouldn't be unwelcome in my house."

bobdylan,2zbflr,Grizzlyhorse,8,Tue Mar 17 06:11:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think he wrote it, but there's something about ""He Was a Friend of Mine"" that's just so.. plaintive, and emotive, it quickly ended up as one of my favourites of his.   His small, sad little voice in that song breaks my heart a little bit whenever I hear it. Same with ""Moonshiner"" - again, not his, but there's something about the soulful, meek little young (but so full of understanding) voice singing about something so sad that gets me every time. Bob Dylan's Dream and A Song to Woody also fit this category for me, but they're actually his.  Lay Down Your Weary Tune is one of my favourites, but as far as I know it was never hugely underrated and is still acknowledged as one of his higher-rated songs, along with Percy's Song, Farewell Angelina, Dark Eyes, I'll Keep It With Mine, etc.  EDIT: On another note entirely, Talkin' Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues cracks me up every damn time."
bobdylan,2zbflr,liah,7,Tue Mar 17 05:32:50 2015 UTC,"Some great choices in this thread.   This is a hard one though, as there is 'underrated by the general public' (which, let's face it, most of Dylan's catalogue is) and 'underrated by Dylan fans'.   The ones I think are underrated to some extent by both of these groups are:    Nobody 'Cept You One of Us Must Know - I know it's on bloody Blonde on Blonde, but I still do believe it doesn't get the credit it deserves exactly because it is on BoB between Visions and I Want You I'll Remember You (listen to the Masked and Anonymous version!) Dark Eyes Disease of Conceit   Of course, on another day, the list might look like this:    Percy's Song Po' Boy Seven Days Angelina What Good Am I   Then there are whole albums which I always felt ought to get more love, particularly Planet Waves and New Morning. Street-Legal is an oft mentioned example of an underrated album, but it's so 'oft mentioned' that it has almost become appropriately rated.   Oh, and regardless of how highly one rates Tangled Up In Blue and Idiot Wind, it's still not enough.  ;)"

That is if Hibbing is 'the little Minnesota town'.  4) Heart of Mine - From Biograph of course - just an incredible song, and great singing from Bob.  5) Narrow Way - Bob channelling the Mississippi Sheiks, what could be better? - I love Tempest, and this is a great one but doesn't seem to get much love.

Most of these should be available on bootleg.   The 'lawsuit' version (a slower, more explicit take) is also available on bootleg - they were forced to re-record this due to legal threats.   A total of 13 Hurricane takes have been recorded, three in the summer and 10 later in October.

bobdylan,2yk1um,SurrealistSwimmer,4,Wed Mar 11 01:30:43 2015 UTC,"Pretty much as surrealistswimmer has said, it really depends on what kind of thing you're looking for. Maybe think about which period of Bobby's career is your favourite?  For me, I love Bob's very early stuff - so I've got a few little tapes from right back in the Hibbing days, then you've got recordings of around the time of his first album and the first few years in New York etc. But like you said there's so much out there, so if you've got a good idea of what you're looking for, that's probably the best way to start.   Also, I'd recommend having a scout around bobsboots, if you click on 'CD' and then 'dates' you can view a ton of boots in chronological order which is cool.   Also, they have a list of the best boots here which might be useful - http://www.bobsboots.com/CDs/00_Musthave.html"

Before, the sheer volume of bootlegs to choose from was kind of daunting, but now it doesn't seem quite as intimidating.  For some reason, what does amaze me now is how long he's been out there, being a legend and making all this great music, much of which hasn't been officially released.   When I was first getting into Bob (about a year ago exactly) I was reading the YouTube comments on a video of Lay, Lady, Lay as I hadn't bought Nashville Skyline yet, and some guy there was saying that he wished he could just lose the memory of any Dylan he ever listened to so that he could start over again, and experience all of the best albums for the first time in one month the way he did when he was fifteen.  I didn't understand what he meant, because I was fifteen and in the middle of the magical month of hearing the electric trilogy, the folk stuff, Blood on the Tracks, etc. for the first time and having it all be new.  Now I sort of do, though, and it means a lot to be connected with a new avenue through which to reach the as-of-yet untouched (by me) frontiers of the Dylanverse.     Sorry if that was too long and sappy, but I'll definitely look around Bob's Boots and search for what you all have suggested."
bobdylan,2yk1um,SurrealistSwimmer,5,Wed Mar 11 01:26:32 2015 UTC,"My, didn't realise you were still so young! Excellent stuff - you have many years of discovering new Dylan ahead of you...  :)   My two bits of advice, should it help:    Don't rush. I know there's a lot of people here and elsewhere screaming ""Get this!"" or ""You must listen to this; it's awesome!"" about a thousand times over. Frankly, you can't listen to it all at once and if you do, you'll miss a lot of it. I speak from personal experience: there are periods I rushed through, didn't enjoy and relegated as 'shit'. Years later, a chance listen made me realise just what I missed. So don't feel you must listen to everything all the time and all at once. Skim through some of the suggestions here (maybe listen to a few songs from each show), figure out which sound you like and explore a bit more of that. If you get tired of it, you can always pick the next set of boots - with Dylan, one can literally spend years discovering new eras and new nuances of already explored eras, so no need to cram it all in: it's not a school test.  Don't feel ashamed if you don't like something. Many decibels of screaming were sent my direction over the years because of my dislike of things like the Supper Club shows or Brixton 2005. I'm sorry, I just don't like them and pretending I do only means I'm forced to listen to it more often. At the same time, many don't get my fetish with '76 (which, incidentally, I initially hated). So don't feel like you have to listen to something over and over again because you feel you ought to 'get it'. If you don't, you don't. Don't fret. Maybe there's nothing to get - people can be crazy, after all. Maybe you'll get around to it at some point later on, like I did with '76. Maybe never. Or, who knows, maybe I'll be here 20 years from now, cursing anyone who doesn't appreciate the majestic beauty of a rasped amelodic 'Waiting For You' from 2005..."
bobdylan,2yk1um,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Wed Mar 11 01:45:31 2015 UTC,"Uff, that is a difficult question that will get many answers. What are your preferences? Do you prefer Bootleg Series-style compilations of the 'best' performances or complete shows? Studio outtakes?   Do you have favourite eras or would you rather have a representative sample from across Dylan's career? Do you have a lot of listening time available to immerse yourself into multiple shows from a tour or do you want a more precise 'tactical' selection?   It really depends on the above. For a long time, I relied on sample shows from across the decades and when a show interested me, I looked into more shows from that period. But I eventually discovered that I missed out on a lot of great experiences because I didn't initially click with the 'sample' show from that period (looking at you, '87-'91).   Edit: Also, how tolerant are you in terms of audio quality? There are a lot of, say, '76 shows I enjoy immensely but others cannot stand, simply because the audio quality is, lightly put, atrocious."
bobdylan,2yk1um,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Tue Mar 10 15:56:52 2015 UTC,"I think I'm mostly looking for stuff from around the Rolling Thunder period and maybe a general survey of the best live performances he's done on the Never-Ending Tour, if such a thing is even possible considering the duration, range, and awesomeness of that venture.    Considering that I've been listening to a whole bunch of old Delta blues from the 30s lately, audio quality isn't really a problem.    I also don't want to wade through a whole bunch of raw outtakes, so I guess I'd mostly be interested in live performances, or maybe a curated collection of better outtakes."
bobdylan,2yk1um,DylanFloyd,12,Tue Mar 10 19:33:21 2015 UTC,"Right, so generally post-60s stuff then. '75 is pretty well-liked by most people, but after that we run into the territory of personal preference. Nowhere is this more true than with the NET, where you will find people who have been following Dylan for decades (and who generally agree on most things and are fairly nice people to boot) getting into vehement, fierce and at times relationship-changing arguments.   You will find people openly mocking 1991 and you will find others who will listen to little else. Particularly with shows after 2002 will you find most disagreement, although I think most people agree the 'static set list' shows of post-2013 are of very high quality, even if of low surprise factor (with exceptions).   With this in mind, I'll compile a short list here with boots that I think are worth listening to and some other people (i.e. not necessarily me) believe are worth listening to.   Also, I should note that I'm not a big fan of Dylan's studio outtakes and I think most of the stuff worth listening to has already been released officially, so I won't put much of that here. Finally, whilst historically Dylan bootlegs have been referred to by the name of the commercial releases they first appeared on, the Internet has made this a rather archaic thing to do, so I'll refer to boots by show dates, as opposed to bootleg names.   Now, without much ado:    Year Show/Performance Choice by... Notes    1974 Los Angeles, 14 February (afternoon) people 1974 isn't my thing and, frankly, I don't enjoy any of it. But a lot of people are full of praise for this show. To me though, it doesn't sound any different from the rest of 'em... I would track down a live 'Nobody 'Cept You' though, as those are better than the BS 1-3 outtake   1974 Blood on the Tapes all Blood on the Tracks outtakes. Essential   1975 (VIDEO) World of John Hammond people Pre-Rolling Thunder TV performance featuring 'Hurricane', 'Oh, Sister' and 'Simple Twist of Fate'. Interesting, but pales compared to what was to come   1975 Live at the Bitter End all Worth just for the piercing Abandoned Love. Get it, I'll say no more   1975 (VIDEO) Renaldo & Clara songs all The film is difficult to watch and if you want to sit through all four hours of it, I would recommend in reading Dylan's interviews discussing the subject before watching it - they will help you 'get' (or at least pretend to 'get') the film. The songs however, both from performances and from Rolling Thunder rehearsals played in the background, are the best of Dylan's career, in my opinion   1975 Rolling Thunder Revue #1 (RTR) all/me I'm an RTR nut, so I'd say ""just get all of them"". But, if you want popular opinion, get Plymouth, 31 October; Waterbury, 11 November; Boston, 21 November (evening); Toronto, 1 December and New York, 8 December. I also like Montreal. But how can you have a show without 'Mr Tambourine Man', played so well during 1975? Or what about the unique performance of 7 December? See? This is why I say ""just get them all"".   1976 (VIDEO) Hard Rain all Fantastic performance under the soaking sky, captured on video in all its glory. The 'Idiot Wind' is absolutely chilling and, in my opinion, the best of the whole tour   1976 (VIDEO) Unreleased Hard Rain me A more subdued performance and not all performances are equally excellent. But 'Tambourine Man', 'Times They Are A'Changing' and 'Just Like a Woman' are all hauntingly beautiful. Don't skip this   1976 Houston, 25 January me A fascinating show, this. It's 'Night of the Hurricane #2' but the energy is very odd - somewhere between '75 and '76, not quite either. The performances are also changing and are in-between. Bad sound quality, but as a bridge between the two RTR legs, it is worth finding   1976 Rolling Thunder Revue #2 me People sure hate 1976. Dylan has dropped the 'Renaldo' act and is tired, bitter, at times mean and at times broken. It's the full spectrum of a man worn out by life and it is a haunting listen. I still say ""get them all"", but if you find it difficult to listen to, I (and people) would at least recommend New Orleans, 3 May (evening); Fort Worth, 16 May and Fort Collins, 23 May. I personally also find the first show, Lakeland, captivating, but the sound is horrible on that one   1978 Rundown Studio Rehearsals some/me Look, it's big and messy, but an interesting look into how Dylan prepared for tours. Plus, some performances are really really good. It's a better rehearsal collection than the one from 1976, I think   1978 Paris, Charlotte & LA all/me I love 1978. I even love 'Budokan'. But if 'Budokan' isn't your thing, at least check out the shows that followed, once the band was fully into it. The thing is, 1978 is full of gems and surprises, but they take time to unearth. For complete shows, listen to Paris, 6 July; Charlotte, 10 December and I'd even say LA, 2 June. After that, you may find you'll want to seek out more of 1978, particularly Europe   1980 (VIDEO) Toronto, 20 April people Gospel Dylan isn't my thing, but I have to admit the performances are full of passion. This one was captured on video and even I can't resist watching it occasionally. A lot of people adore it, so do have a look   1981 Avignon, 25 July all 1981 is really the last tour with Dylan at his vocal best and here he brings back his 'secular' songs. The Avignon show is a universal favourite, but London, 29 June; New Orleans, 10 November and Houston, 12 November are also good if you like Avignon   1984 (VIDEO) Letterman all You can find this on YouTube, but if you haven't seen it, do. 'Jokerman' in particular is outstanding and very different from the album version   1986 Sydney, 24 February and (VIDEO) Hard to Handle people Dylan's tour with Petty. The Sydney show is all right and there is a good video of the Australian leg, but it never really struck a chord with me   1988 Wantaugh, 30 June some/me Right, we're entering very subjective waters here. 1988 is early NET: chaotic, improvised, moody and with his covers often outshining original material. From here on in, Dylan's tours will always be better known for individual performances than whole shows. This, however, is a cracking concert as agreed by many   1990 London, 8 Feburary many/me My second favourite show of the entire NET. I could write a whole essay about it, but suffice to say this is early NET at its best. The 'Disease of Conceit' is magnificent. Listen to it. If you like it, a lot of 1990 Europe is worth perusing   1990 'Toad's Place', 12 January crazy people This... is a very 'unique' show. It is basically a very long public rehearsal, where Dylan is in a very loose, talkative mood and is even playing requests. It's not 'great' in the traditional sense (in fact, I've never been able to listen to the whole thing in one go), but it is interesting   1991 Stuttgart, 17 June no one Look 1991 gets a lot of bad press. The second half of 1991 has some very good moments. But if you want to know what all the negative rage is about, listen to this show and imagine you paid money to see it (although now being there is considered some sort of masochistic triumph)   1993 Supper Club, 16-17 November people The original 'MTV Unplugged', the Supper Club shows were recorded for an official release that never happened. Dylan is focussed, the band is impeccable. Maybe it's because of this that I don't like it - it's just too... 'perfect'... for my taste. A lot of people consider these the best shows of the NET though   1994 (VIDEO) Woodstock, 14 August some/me For years, I pretended to dislike this show because of its context. However, aged as I am, I can't deny it is a spirited show that I enjoy watching, despite the 'MTV' camera work. For another great video from this year, check out the Japan orchestral performance of 'Hard Rain'   1995 Prague, 11 March all sane people and me Look, all European shows of 1995 are in my eyes magnificent. Bust this one is my favourite NET show, period. Dylan was struck with illness the night before and almost cancelled the show. Instead, weak as he was, he came on stage without a guitar and delivered a stunning intimate performance. 'Tambourine Man', 'Shelter'... all great. Not to be missed and, should you like it, look up other shows from this early European leg   1996 Berlin, 17 June all 1996, like '95', had many highlights but Europe got the best of the year again. This Berlin show... listen to the 'My Back Pages'. If you like that, listen to the whole show. If you like that, see you down the rabbit hole   2000 Portsmouth, 24-25 September all 2000 is a bit like '95-'96 - a lot of it is good. But for me, the Portsmouth shows are stand-outs in that they are both almost through-and-through great and have some great highlights as well. If you like it, explore more of 2000   2002 UK shows me For many years, I considered 2002 Dylan's last great touring year. Sure, there were highlights after that too, but this one, I felt, was the last tour with whole solid shows. Of those, Brighton through Birmingham (2-10 May) are the most enjoyable ones   2013 London, 26 November me 2013 was a revelation. The static set lists put off many, but the quality of the shows rose substantially. The highlight of that tour (and of the whole post-2013 renaissance) is still the first Royal Albert Hall show, in my opinion. Closed with a poignant 'Roll On, John'    And that's it! My... 'short'... list. With regards to the big NET gaps post-1996... firstly, I ran out of space and, secondly, it is a contentious period. Some shows I like and people don't, some vice-versa. 8 December '97, 19 May '98, 9 June '98, 28 April '99, 12 July '01, all of London '03 and '05 and Glasgow '04 are representative. Post '05 is generally more interesting for set lists than performances. But let me know if you'd like to expand on the NET more."
bobdylan,2yk1um,willington123,3,Tue Mar 10 23:50:16 2015 UTC,"Ill second of all these suggestions, especially 1975-6, 1988 and 2000 as well as 1986 and 2002."
bobdylan,2yk1um,SurrealistSwimmer,3,Wed Mar 11 12:02:08 2015 UTC,"Shit, this is incredible. Thanks for posting all of this - it reminds me that I need to desperately add to my collection.  I've heard great things about Avignon, the supper club shows and a lot of Rolling Thunder - a period I have rather embarrassingly got very little of.  Though I'm working my way through, and bloody enjoying, Bob's Hammersmith residency in 1990 which is incredible. I also love going back to the three date gig at the Royal Albert Hall in November 2013, I was there for the final night - so far my only time seeing Bobby - and it was so damn great."
bobdylan,2yk1um,willington123,2,Wed Mar 11 12:15:49 2015 UTC,"No worries - always glad to take people across the Styx and into the wonderful world of Dylan bootlegs, a world few escape unscathed...  :)   If you like the 1990 residency, I'd really recommend looking into some '95-'96 shows. They're a bit more tame compared to 1990, but I have always thought of those two periods as the best of the NET. If you like a more 'raw' sound though, '88 and '89 are your years.   Avignon also has a video of it (decent-ish), but if you want a full audio/video experience, both Tolouse and Mannheim are shows of similar quality to Avignon, but with very good and reasonably clear (for the time) video to boot.   Actually, same for the London residency (particularly the last night - it's captivating to watch the tape).   As for 2013, you really picked the long straw there. I went to a few shows of that tour and whilst all of them were of a high standard, it all really came together for the last Blackpool show and the three London ones. The third and first London are, to my ears, both equally great: the first one only edges it because of 'Roll On, John'."
bobdylan,2yk1um,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Wed Mar 11 12:39:21 2015 UTC,"You certainly know your stuff, man. Just as a general wonderment, do you ever frequent ER?   And yes, I'll certainly do that, though I've already got so much in my 'to sort' folder; a strange little set of outtakes from Madhouse on Castle Street, the recent 50th anniversary collection and Jewels and Binoculars  - bloody massive boot which took me like 3 weeks to get, of everything from 1966.   But I may make an exception for Avignon as I've heard great things. Also, there does seem to be something pretty appealing about '88 and '89, with them being the early years of the NET. But if they're anything like Down in the Groove I might struggle; any suggestions for this time though, dude?   Haha, yeah it was so great. Just a shame Bobby hasn't come back since, but I'm thinking a European leg and a UK visit may come later this year, or at least next?!"
bobdylan,2yk1um,willington123,2,Wed Mar 11 20:29:50 2015 UTC,"ER is an absorbing place - I used to go there when I had more time, but now it's mostly just to check out the boots section and for tour news. Plus, a lot of the people that used to be there when I was there are now mostly banned and I'm just too curmudgeonly to make new friends... ;)    Yourself?   Ah, Jewels and Binoculars. That is a monster. Incidentally, that was my first Dylan bootleg - I guess if you get into it, you might as well do it properly. I listened to those discs so much that I now seem to develop a rash whenever I even hear the word '1966'. But it was a glorious time - I'd certainly recommend wading through that and the other early stuff before getting into the NET. Even Avignon might seem a bit alien, but it is a good show (especially in the context of it coming right after the gospel years).   '88-'89 sound-wise is unlike any Dylan album, really, but if I had to compare it to any, it would be 'Good As I Been To You' and 'World Gone Wrong'. At least the acoustic sets. So it depends on whether you like that sort of thing.   The two recommendations for that period would be the Wantaugh show of 30 June '88 and New York, 19 October '88, both excellent and inspired shows. The very early '88 shows are also interesting from a more anthropological sense, as this is the NET taking shape - it's experimental and often very up and down. In fact, a lot of the '88 and '89 stuff is, which is the problem - very rarely do you get a whole show that is excellent.   You can have a show where the first half is fantastic and the second have is inexplicably dreadful. Or shows where the whole thing seems like one big alcoholic haze, only for a superb performance of a single song to shoot straight at you out of nowhere. Sometimes this can happen within a single song (there is a late '88 show I remember where he plays a very good 'Twist of Fate', only to completely mess up the words towards the end). In this respect, '89 is even worse than '88.   If you want the best of it, I would suggest you look at Hollis Brown's YouTube channels (there are a few) and browse through the 1988 and 1989 videos. He is generally very good at collecting the best performances of each year and matching the best audio and video available. Only after such 'acclimatising' would I consider listening to whole shows, as they can sound messy otherwise. Don't get me wrong though - it's still a period I very much enjoy listening to, precisely because of its seemingly 'completely at random' unpredictable nature. But you have been warned.  :)   As for European shows, you're in luck! A tour was just announced (and went on sale) today - I've made a thread for it. It doesn't look likely there will be any UK shows though, but I strongly suspect we'll have them in autumn. All just a rumour for now though."
bobdylan,2yk1um,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Fri Mar 13 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, that's interesting - yeah I frequent ER pretty regularly, I always like to talk Bobby Dylan, as you may have guessed, and everyone on there seems to be pretty cool and welcoming.   Haha, J&B is indeed a monster, in all honesty I haven't really tried to tackle it, mostly owing to the fact that I don't even know where to start - though perhaps the beginning might be an obvious place - but still it's strangely intimidating with a boot of that size. I don't know, maybe I'm just being weird.  And I will certainly check those '88, '89 shows out - so thank you for the recommendation - and I'm a big fan of the nineties folk albums so I'm looking forward to hearing them. And yes, I did see the your announcement, though the dates looked a bit tentative for BD, I was of the assumption that he usually announced a long list of dates - though I'm sure once he's on the continent more dates will follow - fingers crossed for some UK dates, man!"
bobdylan,2yk1um,ThinWildMercury1,1 point,Mon Mar 16 09:52:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the best thing is just plunge straight in from the start. Frankly, some of those discs you'll only listen to once and never again because of the poor quality (I mean really, a few of those Australian dates sound like they were recorded through loo roll from the parking lot outside the venue), so you'll whittle it down to a more manageable size after the first listen.   If you like the late folk albums, there are also a few compilations of just the acoustic stuff from those years - that also might be a way to go. I usually like to listen to whole shows, but one can only listen through so many '88 Subterranean Homesick Blues, so the compilations are a good way to just get the best stuff, albeit out of context. If early NET is great for one thing, it's the covers, which he sometimes seems to care about more than his own songs, so they usually are the stand-out performances of each show.   As for the current tour, a few people are saying it's pretty much certain there will be no UK dates in the summer. Autumn, however... I'd recommend starting to save up for those tickets (although nothing is ever fully confirmed until it's fully confirmed)."

bobdylan,2yk1um,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Fri Mar 13 16:55:17 2015 UTC,How many Dylan shows have you been to?
bobdylan,2yk1um,Thelonious_Cube,2,Wed Mar 11 04:28:39 2015 UTC,"Only about 30 or so. I got on board quite late and, sadly, my life swung from a place where I had budgetary constraints at first to where there is little time for me to follow tours now (which is quite a fun thing to do - I do recommend following a few shows of a tour once, although it's a bit less exciting now with the static sets).   Some people might baulk at the phrase 'only 30', but your average dedicated NET follower you see on the road has seen 100-200 over the years (and some have seen much much more). I once met a lady who has seen 50 shows despite not being much into Dylan at all - she just accompanies her slightly more obsessed husband every now and then."
bobdylan,2yk1um,Imipolex42,1 point,Wed Mar 11 09:08:26 2015 UTC,"a curated collection of better outtakes   You might look for the ""Genuine Bootleg Series"" (4 volumes of 3 discs each) - a bootleggers response to the Official Bootleg series.  Each volume is a well-curated collection of studio outtakes and live tracks.  The only drawback is that the live cuts aren't complete shows and you may end up duplicating a lot of that stuff - but that's a danger with any ""best of"" set.  The original Scorpio CD editions tend to be expensive, but I think other bootleggers have issued them more cheaply (OMS, for example) - and you can probably torrent them all"

Of course all of the ""official"" Bootleg Series sets are all essential. Other than those I'd say my all-time favorite is The Blood on the Tracks, New York Sessions. Simply amazing. I am hoping that this becomes a part of the next official bootleg series as rumors say it will. http://www.bobsboots.com/CDs/cd-b28.html  Next, I'd say Plymouth Rock. It's a bootleg from the first Rolling Thunder concert venue. The recording is not anything hi def but I love the energy of the whole thing. Also I'd recommend ""Hold the Fort, for what it's worth."" http://www.bobsboots.com/CDs/cd-p16.html  The official bootleg of the Rolling Thunder tour has some great performances but they are collections from various places and, to me, completely fail to give a sense of what an actual RTR concert was like. Hold the Fort really gives you a sense of how loose and fun one of those concerts were. http://www.bobsboots.com/CDs/cd-h37.html  Another one I'd suggest, from the early years is ""Stud's Terkel's Wax Museum."" There's ton's of bullshit stories Bob tells about his past leavened with some great early solo performances. I especially love the version he does of ""Farewell"" on this one. http://www.bobsboots.com/CDs/cd-s73.html  ""Thin Wild Mercury Music"" is an incredible collection of electric Bob in the studio working out tracks for, mostly, ""Highway 61."" Awesome stuff that deserves another official clean up. http://www.bobsboots.com/CDs/cd-t21.html  Here's a list from the Bob Boots site that might give you a bit more guidance. http://www.bobsboots.com/CDs/00_Musthave.html#release"

It's easy to do so since it's super religious, but all through 1980 he was on fire, playing with a hell of an energy.  And by the fall, Dylan was playing a bunch of his older stuff with his gospel band so expect lots of organs, backup singers and good playin'. Some neat originals from this period, too, like Caribbean Wind.   Oh this year has plenty of BobTalk, which is really why people like bootlegs! Crazy sermons, weird stories from the road and Bob just generally being Bob!"

Here's a bunch from 2002, besides Mutineer: Accidently Like A Martyr, Boom Boom Mancini (a couple of times), Lawyers Guns And Money, End Of The Innocence, Old Man, Brown Sugar, Something (one-off), Brown Sugar, Hummingbird.  Here are some others, mostly from 1999-2000, many show openers: Wait For The Light To Shine, I Am The Man Thomas, Stone Walls and Steel Bars, Cocaine Blues, Hallelujah I'm Ready To Go, Not Fade Away."
bobdylan,2yhyp6,DylanFloyd,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:51:41 2015 UTC,"I had this version of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah on a random mix CD from years ago.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-SZaaABrl40  It looks like he only played this song twice - Montreal and LA in July and August 1988, respectively. It's obviously one of those shows.  People might disagree with me but I feel like he channels another Canadian legend through his singing and guitar playing on this song. I'm talking about Neil."
bobdylan,2yfdlk,jkelaty,2,Mon Mar 9 09:42:12 2015 UTC,"Wow, early, even before Freewheelin' was released. Love hearing the progression of his songs, like Hollis Brown, which by the time it ends up on Times is quite different than here (opposed to Boots, which sounds here exactly as the album version). Love the songs I'm not too familiar with like Walls of Red Wing and Hiding Too Long. Love that youthful confidence in voice, but also love the careful determination of Hard Rain (where there was a big cheer as it starts, showing its popularity before the album release). Love the driving, nonstop pace of the show. And I love the photos in the background; hadn't seen many of them before!"
bobdylan,2yf924,AllisonSam,1 point,Mon Mar 9 08:21:01 2015 UTC,"Rumours of new tours during the year usually don't surface until the previous tour is under way, so I would reckon mid-April is the earliest time we're going to get any whispers of the next leg (and whilst whispers often get the dates wrong, they rarely get the continent wrong).   As for official confirmation, that usually happens two months before a tour, so in the case of July, we're looking at May for anything official.   Edit: Well then, the thing with Dylan is, you can never count on anything and the same goes for the general schedule of Dylan rumours. I just received an email full of speculations and whispers, and it seems the summer leg (July is the whisper) could well happen around Southern Europe (Croatia is the country mentioned). Nevertheless, these are just rumours, mind."

bobdylan,2yb0oy,Twathammer32,2,Sun Mar 8 03:41:29 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, there were five takes of this song in the format you are looking for - in 3/4 time, with just the piano and harmonica and a lone guitar I think. The one on bootleg series 1-3 is the longest take and the last one done in the 3/4 time format with just the piano. I don't think they got past the first chorus in any of the other recordings during this first session.  The next session, they used Kooper's organ and Dylan was on the electric guitar, and they recorded the final version of the song. So I think the best you're going to get is what's on the bootleg you mentioned.   I just paraphrased what I found here."

bobdylan,2y7atl,dylanthegrey,1 point,Sun Mar 8 01:28:59 2015 UTC,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wR3_RMpBksI  I saw him a few years ago and it was interesting. I know he spends more time behind the keyboard now than a guitar so be prepared for that. His voice is extremely gruff and warn and he's not the best at enunciating. From what I have read his performances have been a little better the past two years but he's a 80+ year old man so don't expect too much galavanting on stage.
bobdylan,2y7atl,dorky2,1 point,Sun Mar 8 13:05:42 2015 UTC,"It's all keyboard, baby grand, and harmonica now. I was lucky enough to see Bob play some guitar in my first show."

But then I love My Back Pages, I think I could listen to it every day for the rest of my life and still love it, so god knows!

bobdylan,2xueg8,willington123,3,Wed Mar 4 03:14:18 2015 UTC,Chimes suffers from the same problems as the original Another Side version of Mr. Tambourine Man: the vocals from the session are too unfocused for such a long song. The version from Newport 1964 soars and does the song justice.
bobdylan,2xueg8,Breakfasty,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:37:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, though that version's still pretty special with Ramblin' Jack Elliott on it.

That said, I agree that no one sings Dylan like Dylan, and I prefer the originals in all cases.   But I have always appreciated how radical and inventive the Byrds' interpretations were. They didn't just make Dylan top 40 friendly (which he wasn't at the time), but they re-imagined the songs from the ground-up. I had a chance to meet Roger McGuinn, and we talked about how the Byrds' ""Tambourine Man"" uses a Bach-influenced guitar intro, the beat from the Beach Boys' ""Don't Worry Baby"" and the overall Beatles harmonic approach to create a new amalgam. Then add those lyrics? What a package!"

bobdylan,2xfuof,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Sat Feb 28 19:38:10 2015 UTC,"Indeed it is.   The problem with these '66 clips is that they all come from Eat The Document, quite possibly one of the most chaotic attempts at making a film ever (well... perhaps besides Renaldo & Clara).    Now I've heard multiple interpretations of what happened and why we only have snippets of filmed performances, the gist of which is:    Pennebaker deliberately only filmed short segments of songs to suit his needs and therefore no complete videos exist  Full performances were filmed but only snippets were used for Eat the Document because... well... Dylan was doing the editing and he's the typical contrarian Dylan. These full performances are now, however, lost or beyond repair Full performances were filmed, Dylan should never edit films and the original recordings are kept under a hundred locks in Pennebaker's possession   I used to believe the first theory, considering this is '66 we're talking about and everything was done upside-down back then, but with NDH, we all of a sudden got full performances of Like a Rolling Stone and Just Like a Woman, so I wouldn't be surprised now if there actually turned out to be a lot in the archives.   Same as with The Beatles' Let It Be or Dylan's '76 and '79-'81 stuff though, I think we won't see any of this until the principal actors are gone and the cash flow and veto powers are gone with them."

bobdylan,2xfuof,SurrealistSwimmer,2,Sun Mar 1 18:35:16 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I just hope it's not 18 hours of a stoned Dylan arguing over breakfast and that at least some of it is proper concert footage. Would make a good basis for a video Bootleg Series (should they ever actually decide to do it).   Although personally, I would sacrifice all 18 hours of '66 outtakes (and more) to get the unused concert footage from Renaldo & Clara (which was apparently all destroyed in a fire some years back)."

bobdylan,2w1kjk,woweezowee34,3,Mon Feb 16 13:53:28 2015 UTC,"If we're just looking at guitar (i.e., without singing or harmonica), I'd say ""Girl from the North Country."" It's painfully beautiful, has an interesting harmony, and sounds good either fingerpicked or strummed. Hell, even its new live versions, which use a simple Dadd4/9 - C - G (instead of the original e9 - D7/F# - G) for the verses are fun to play in their own right. Close calls are the Gaslight version of ""John Brown,"" and Tell Tale Sign's version of ""Tell Ol' Bill.""  If we include singing/harmonica in the matter, ""Up to Me"" has a wonderful vocal melody rhythm that just amazes me everytime I come into contact with the song. Really dig ""Ramona"" from Another Side as well."

Takes some getting used to as a beginner but once you've got the chords down it's really cool.

I play a sort of mix between the Concert for Bangladesh version and the 1966 Live version. I also throw in some other minor stuff that he usually does in songs with similar chord progressions.  For the lyrics it would have to be Visions of Johanna, hands down.  But the one I think is the most fun to play would have to be Open The Door Homer (Take 3).

Honourable mention to the 2011-2013 barked Ballads with an echo reinforcing each word. But those needed to be experienced live - a video doesn't do them justice.   '74 and '78 are also interesting versions, but I find the former a bit too neurotic (alongside the entire tour) and the latter far too strange. People say the versions from 1986 are also good, but I've never had the urge to actually dig a show up from that era."

bobdylan,2vvnk2,SurrealistSwimmer,3,Sat Feb 14 17:13:10 2015 UTC,All about the '75 leg of the Rolling Thunder Revue anyway
bobdylan,2vvnk2,ThinWildMercury1,1 point,Sat Feb 14 17:19:02 2015 UTC,"Uff, bold claim. 1975 is something magical, it really is, but, as with '66, I felt I gravitated away from it over the years. It can be a bit too much at times.   Some of '76 is truly masterful: Idiot Wind, Just Like A Woman, You're A Big Girl Now, One Too Many Mornings, Johanna, I Want You etc. But it is harder to listen to, I give you that. The '76 shows make reality hit harder. The '75 ones take you away from reality altogether.   1975 RTR will always be special but between that or a '76, '78, '90, '95 or even 2000 show, I'm not sure which I'd pick on any given day. But at least I listen to it every now and then, something I can't say for 1966."
bobdylan,2vvnk2,SurrealistSwimmer,3,Sat Feb 14 17:27:34 2015 UTC,"What? 1966 is awesome!  Tell Me Momma, Leopard Skin Pillbox Hat, One Too Many Mornings- all so good! And then the entire acoustic set is hypnotic.  As for '75 vs '76 Rolling Thunder, '76 certainly had its moments (You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go and Idiot Wind are some of my personal favorites) but even the people on the tour say by '76 the energy had somewhat ran out and that the intensity and brilliance of the tour was most concentrated in '75.    Just my opinion though!"
bobdylan,2vvnk2,ThinWildMercury1,1 point,Sat Feb 14 17:37:12 2015 UTC,"Of course, all we can have about Dylan are opinions.  :)   But it's fun discussing them.   To explain my slight antipathy towards 1966: I used to adore it. For a few years, it was all I wanted my life to be: explosive, irreverent, ground-breaking. I went out of my way to acquire the whole 'Jewels & Binoculars' set (comprising all known 1966 recordings) and played it on loop.   But... suddenly it felt untrue. It felt loud. Yes, there was a lot of noise and yes, it was different and it was great, but what did it tell me? What did I gain from it? It somehow felt... shallow. It was an important cultural statement, but, once my 'life energy' faded, I didn't feel particularly invested in it. In fact, the guy in it felt annoying.   I just couldn't relate to it anymore. It was a statement - a pose. Once the lustre wore off, all I found was just a lot of noise and harmonica solos.   Also, I think I just listened to it a bit too much and had too much of a 'good thing', as they say.   In fact, I think I feel about 1975 in a similar way. 1975 is very different from '66, of course, but it also felt like a statement. Compare the two Just Like A Women (?):    1975: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFmoBNpayWo (this was incredibly difficult to find, Web Sheriff - I don't like you)  1976: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_o8ks4yIu0   The 1975 version is great - magnificent even. It's dynamic, it's creative. But it feels like it's 'Renaldo sings Just Like A Woman' and Renaldo happens to be played by Bob Dylan. It feels like a show, like most of 1975 is and does.   Fast forward through the 1976 version and you will miss it, but there lies a lot underneath the slow, understated approach. Where the 1975 version breaks down for all the good reasons (improvisation, pace), here it breaks down for all the bad ones - heaviness, pain, cynicism. It feels like it isn't Renaldo singing anymore. In fact, Renaldo probably long lies dead in some ditch.   This is Bob Dylan singing it. And it hits hard. I can't listen to it often, as it exhausts me. It is almost uncomfortable (even for the band and audience it seems), but god is it towering. There is emotional greatness in there that neither the '66 version (adding the video for reference) nor the '75 one can touch.   Are the '66 and '75 ones more entertaining? Definitely. Which is the more 'human' one, I feel? Which one can I relate to? 1976, by a mile, an elephant and three grasshoppers.   And this goes for the tour, as well as Just Like A Woman.   My gut feeling is that this is also why Dylan's people won't touch 1976 with a barge pole until he is gone and there is no one left to have to re-live those difficult few months.   EDIT: I should also say that I completely get that people feel '76 'ran out of steam'. It felt tired. That's because it was, as was Dylan. But I think therein lies its appeal and its uniqueness. Few performances have ever captured tiredness in this way (I mean... it could've been like 1991, which is a prime example of how not to channel tiredness well)."
bobdylan,2vvnk2,SkipBittman,2,Sat Feb 14 18:13:00 2015 UTC,"1966 isn't shallow to me at all.  It's a battle between Dylan and all the press and folk purists had pinned him down as.  It was punk a decade or so before that culture even emerged.  It's also Dylan battling his physical limits.  He would literally walk off stage and collapse and have to be carried to his car after some shows and yet he still gave it his all.  When he sings 'I'm going back to New York City, I do believe I've had enough' he is Tom Thumb, down and out in Juarez and has very much had enough, and he's singing his heart out saying so.  As for '75 being Renaldo and not Dylan, I'm not so sure.  Dylan's been playing a character his whole life to some degree anyway, but if you listen to Sara from '75 how can you hear that as anything other than an intensely personal and painful experience for Dylan? The same applies Tangled Up In Blue or Simple Twist of Fate.  Edit: '1966' not '!966'"
bobdylan,2vvnk2,nostrilz,1 point,Sat Feb 14 18:35:28 2015 UTC,"Totally agree - I think Surrealist misses the mark on the '66 and in the face of that his preference for '76 is a little curious. (I also prefer '76, it sounds angrier.) But he is right that we are all entitled to an opinion - especially when it is all so bloody subjective."

bobdylan,2vt0xm,SurrealistSwimmer,1 point,Fri Feb 13 21:09:08 2015 UTC,"Dylan was severely ill with a bug before the show and there was talk of it being cancelled. Not to be deterred by the puny shackles of physical frailty, Dylan took the stage regardless and delivered one of the most cherished concerts of the NET.   Whilst clearly uncomfortable throughout the show, this duress produced moments of true magic, such as this spellbinding Shelter From The Storm. In a throwback to the days of Isis and 1975, Dylan performed most of the show without a guitar, harmonica in hand (probably because of his discomfort).   Fortunately, the quality of this show wasn't a one-off and the rest of 1995 proved to be one of the NET's finest years.   EDIT: Having now successfully gone through an entire evening of binging on 1995, here is another simply wonderful performance: Mr Tambourine Man from April (Manchester). Not only is it a truly magical performance, it's also one of the rare videos from that era where the cameraman has managed to get a steady close up shot of Dylan performing."

bobdylan,2vlp5x,charles_barkley_bot,4,Fri Feb 13 00:27:25 2015 UTC,"'Is Your Love In Vain?' has always been a guilty pleasure of mine. I love the melody, but whenever I started listening to the words I thought: ""My god, this is utter shit, isn't it?""  Then I came across the live version he played in Gothenburg 1978. Hearing that broken desperate wail, I suddenly felt I 'got it'. It's not patronising. It's not the sexist uncharacteristic nonsense I took it as. It's the unfiltered cry of a broken man. And just like that, the song went from being my shameful guilty pleasure to being one of the Dylan compositions I hold on some of my highest pedestals.   Or maybe it's just because I like my Dylan broken. I'm twisted that way."

I think it's such a terrible shame he has not sung any of the Street-Legal songs live since then (except Señor). I would give anything to hear more live renditions of Changing of the Guards and Where Are You Tonight or True Love Tends to Forget. Such an underrated album. By the way, great rendition this was. I also never cared much for this song, but now I'm hearing it in a totally different way."

I love the sharp, wordy  lyrics and Dylan's half-spoken delivery. If he stripped away all the cheesy production and backup singers and did it more like Long and Wasted Years, it would have been a great song."

I know taste is all relative and that that's the whole point of this thread, but still I fail to see how it could 'objectively' be seen as a truly bad song. I know Empire Burlesque often gets bad reviews, mostly deserved, but there are a few ""bad songs"" on it that I really like. I enjoy 'When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky' (though the original Stevie van Zandt version on Bootleg 1-3 is way better) and 'Clean Cut Kid' a lot."

I would've left off Dead Man, Dead Man and Trouble in favor of You Changed My Life and Angelina. Also the production could've been smoother, though Dylan wanted it to sound rough.

bobdylan,2vhgzk,kingtao,2,Wed Feb 11 06:40:38 2015 UTC,It makes no sense from what we know publicly.   It's not really as harsh as the headline indicates. In fact he's complimenting Merle.   I saw Dan Rather interview Merle a few months back and he spoke about Bob out of the blue talking about how he encouraged him to go back to playing guitar. John Mellencamp on Howard Stern said that bob is hysterically funny. Maybe it was all a joke that flopped.

bobdylan,2vhzge,kerouacrimbaud,5,Wed Feb 11 03:53:29 2015 UTC,"I agree.  For me, the spoken part adds a light-hearted note that perfectly offsets the tension that is raised for me by the magnificent singing that precedes it.  The tension arises for me because I don't subscribe to the sentiments, but get swept away by the emotion.  I've always assumed that Bob felt something similar (his move to Christianity still being 10 years off).  The real masterstroke for me, though, is that he manages to reconcile the two at the end, bringing back the singing and ending with ""just sing your song and all your troubles will pass right on through"" which is very non-sectarian.  It also aligns well with his later statements about his religion being ""all in the songs"""

bobdylan,2vg9zg,Beksense,8,Tue Feb 10 20:05:08 2015 UTC,"That recording is from Bobby's controversial 1966 world tour - more specifically the concert at the Manchester Free Trade Hall - for years it was a bootlegged and thought to be from the gig at the Royal Albert Hall, hence why the entire concert when officially released by Sony as Bootleg Series 4, was referred to as The ""Royal Albert Hall"" concert.  Anyway, to say that Bob and the Band's new electric sound - this was the first time Bob and the Band had played electrically in the UK - was met with hostility would be an understatement. Literally everywhere they went they were constantly and consistently heckled by the audience after every song in the second half of the show - the first half of all shows was Bobby alone on stage with an acoustic guitar.   Anyway, the night at the MFTH everything came to a head - it's widely considered to be a landmark concert in rock and roll history - one of the guys in the audience, a young guy  - I can't remember his name right now - shouted 'Judas!' which you can hear fairly audibly on the recording, followed by Bob shouting back 'I don't believe you'...'you're a liar' - then more cheering and shouting - and then Bobby turns to the Band and tells them to 'play it fuckin' loud', and they then go into a rip roaring fucking incredible version of Like A Rolling Stone.   Recommended, and I promise this is the last thing I'll say, is obviously the concert itself in it's entirety, but also video footage emerged a couple of years ago of the heckling and the performance of LARS, which as you can expect is awesome - it was shown at the end of Martin Scorcese's No Direction Home documentary, and I'm pretty sure it can be easily found on YouTube.  Oh and I'm reading CP Lee's book, Like The Night, about this very evening right now, definitely recommended.   This concert is honestly my favourite damn recording of anything, including Mr Dylan's catalogue, ever, it's incredible."

""I don't know what critics mean when they say I made a career off of confounding expectations."" Yes, you do, Dylan. Your deliberate contrariness is obvious...AND TOTALLY FINE. If you're motivated by a need to do the opposite, great, it led to some awesome changes (and some atonal disasters).

bobdylan,2v8lx3,SurrealistSwimmer,5,Sun Feb 8 23:04:30 2015 UTC,"Was wondering all day why the 8th of February seemed to bear some special significance in head. And then, as the day is almost over, it hit me: today, 15 years ago, Dylan played one of my all-time favourite shows at the Hammersmith Odeon in London.   The whole residency is excellent, but the last show stands out as something special. Whilst many will say there were better performances on the night, this is to me the most precious: impassioned and seemingly unplanned, this is the sort of raw unrehearsed vintage Dylan live performance we rarely see these days. Plus, it's one of my all-time favourite Dylan tracks in a version that far surpasses the studio take.   From Andy Muir's 'Razor's Edge':    ""All week long Dylan had been teasing us by circling the piano without ever touching its keys. As Dylan now approached the piano once again, the crowd's anticipation was tinged with apprehension that this was another put on. The cheer re-doubled when we realised that this time it was for real. Dylan briefly returned to the front of the stage to revel in the applause before returning to the piano, for an inspired rendition of 'Disease of Conceint'.""   EDIT: Mind you, I cannot mention this show without linking to the possibly most joyful rendition of 'I Want You' Dylan's ever played - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaWvS5DWvcs  EDIT #2: And I just realised 1990 was 25 years ago, not 15... Christ. From hereon in, 8th of February will also signify the day I became one of those old codgers who get dates wrong by a whole bloody decade."

bobdylan,2v50wk,DylanFloyd,3,Sun Feb 8 20:53:49 2015 UTC,"Seriously, that was amazing. I always love hearing that he's much more human than people make him out to be. From what you read in the press, anybody could get the idea that he doesn't even give a shit, that he just releases out of the blue records just to fuck with people.   But he's authentic to the bone and truly cares about whether or not his music connects. I love that."

bobdylan,2v4mj4,ander3jc,3,Sat Feb 7 21:29:23 2015 UTC,"IIRC Dylan could only perform It's Alright Ma during his speed-taking phase because he couldn't keep up with it sober. but that might just be an urban legend.    I remember being really blown away by Idiot Wind when I first bought Hard Rain.  The whole album is great but you get to that last song and its incredible and then the albums over and you're speechless.    I first listened to Bootleg Series Vol 5 when I was on drugs and it blew my mind hearing all these familiar dylan songs take on a new sound, that rock-and-roll touch applied to his classic folk songs really blew me away"
bobdylan,2v4mj4,LastOfTheCamSoreys,3,Tue Feb 10 02:40:39 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, the first time I heard ""It's alright Ma"" I was absolutely blown away. ""If my thought dreams could be seen, they'd probably put my head in a guillotine."" Man, that's as vintage electric Dylan (The tracks acoustic of course, but in terms of the lyrics) as it gets.  My biggest ""Blown away"" moment was the first time I heard ""Idiot Wind"" as well (sorry to piggy back LastOfTheCamSoreys!). I was on vacation in the Smokey Mountains in Tennessee with my family and was sitting on the balcony of our hotel on a warm summer night, reading East of Eden by Steinbeck (Can't make this shit up)!  ""I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me You'll never know the hurt I suffered not the pain I raise above And I'll never know the same about you your holiness or your kind of love And it makes me feel so sorry.""  All you can say to that is wow. I remember I started crying then, and I cry most times I hear that verse even to this day. I always though BOTT-Desire era Dylan was some of the most profound."

A big mistake, in my opinion."

Was just horsing around with the title 'Thievin' Dylan', couldn't give a toss if artists are always 100% original or not, doesn't affect my enjoyment of them much. As Bob himself said in that Rolling Stone interview from 2012, when questioned about his use of quotations from other writers in his songs, such as the civil war poetry of Henry Timrod:   And as far as Henry Timrod is concerned, have you even heard of him? Who's been reading him lately? And who's pushed him to the forefront? Who's been making you read him? And ask his descendants what they think of the hoopla. And if you think it's so easy to quote him and it can help your work, do it yourself and see how far you can get. Wussies and pussies complain about that stuff. It's an old thing – it's part of the tradition.   I think the same applies to musical ideas."

bobdylan,2uspne,Thelonious_Cube,1 point,Thu Feb 5 19:32:47 2015 UTC,"Just like to state that I did not intentionally intend to rile anyone up with my choice of words or spark deep debate.. I've attempted to explain ""Thievin'"" already, 'borrowed' sounds vaguely accusatory.. To anyone who I've upset: Whoops!  I realise that there are quite a few versions of 'Lonesome Road' out there, in case you didn't or couldn't listen to the playlist, this is the version I am referring to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5AM8xtl-uU.  I thought this version at least sounded very musically similar.   what similarities are you hearing?   I think the majority of these similarities transcend mere subjectivity and would stand up to being more intimately analysed in musical terms. Not that this takes away anything from the songs or taints my opinion of Thievin' Bob, personally.."
bobdylan,2uspne,Thelonious_Cube,0,Thu Feb 5 23:59:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the version of Lonesome Road I listened to - I don't really hear a similarity in the melodies.   I think the majority of these similarities transcend mere subjectivity and would stand up to being more intimately analysed in musical terms.   Perhaps that's so, but ""borrowed melodies"" means just that - not similarity of chord structure or an odd chord change - you're saying ""the melodies are the same"" and I don't hear that.  As to your explanation of ""thievin'"" you seem to be saying ""I don't care if he did"" rather than ""I didn't mean he stole the songs"" - that's not the same thing at all"
bobdylan,2uspne,solarandlunar,2,Fri Feb 6 00:20:37 2015 UTC,You could list the songs here.  How many are traditional melodies and therefore not stolen at all?
bobdylan,2uspne,Thelonious_Cube,2,Thu Feb 5 00:39:45 2015 UTC,"What makes something 'traditional' and therefore not thieving? Don't get me wrong, I don't think Dylan's work is 'thieving', I just mean to say that their traditionalist has nothing to do with it. It is absolutely absurd that someone can claim ownership of a melody, of a sound. It's completely ridiculous. It's like someone taking out a patent for the way light reflects on a mirror, it seems absurd.   Music is a tradition meant to be passed down and shared and explored by everyone. To claim ownership and to slander those who expand on it as 'thieves' misses the point of music entirely. It's a completely corporatized view of creation and it happens to be very shallow and so utterly sad."
bobdylan,2uspne,solarandlunar,0,Thu Feb 5 07:14:33 2015 UTC,"What makes something 'traditional' and therefore not thieving?   Well, if it's a traditional melody, then no one owns it or authored it - there's no one to steal from - certainly you could suggest that the credit ought to be ""melody: trad, words and arrangement: Dylan"" but due to the way royalties are paid, that doesn't affect the money, so no one bothers.  However, if it's a trad melody, then you are free to write your own lyrics and Dylan should not be able to successfully sue you.  Note that there's a big difference between ""thievin'"" and ""borrowing"" - OP's title refers to both - one is value judgement, the other is a matter of historical record.  In the case of traditional melodies, the value judgment is misplaced.   It is absolutely absurd that someone can claim ownership of a melody, of a sound. It's completely ridiculous.   So you object to copyright in all forms?   To claim ownership ... misses the point of music entirely.   I disagree - artists should be compensated for their work.  Copyright is a highly imperfect system that was developed in a much different time period (and has been abused by corporate interests), but your view seems thoroughly naive to me."
bobdylan,2uspne,Thelonious_Cube,1 point,Thu Feb 5 19:20:54 2015 UTC,"I know the legality and practicality of it and that's not disputed. I mean, in practical terms, you have copyright and so on. I guess I was just talking more in an idealistic sense.  I mean, it's arbitrary, what makes something 'traditional' vs. something that isn't. It's time. But time is an arbitrary judgement on things. You could say that Jay-Z and Skrillez are traditional musicians. They just happen to be traditional of our times. I know copyright law is there to keep the whole cycle going. It was more of a questioning of what is ""stealing"" by taking something and passing it off as your own and what is simply the practice of borrowing other pieces of music from somewhere else and changing it to fit you. I mean, that's what all of music is. That's what all of art is. It seems like the more blatantly you point that out, the more people get offended by it and call it 'stealing'."
bobdylan,2uspne,Jashin23,1 point,Fri Feb 6 04:04:47 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  It's not just about time, it's also about knowledge. and it's not just 'arbitrary'  Presumably someone composed the melody of ""Yankee Doodle"" but we don't know who it is...thus ""traditional""  On the other hand, we do know (assuming he didn't steal it) who wrote ""Camptown Races"" (Stephen Foster), but it's entered public domain...thus not ""trad"" but ""Foster, P.D.""   You could say that Jay-Z and Skrillez are traditional musicians.   i don't think the term ""traditional musician"" has any real meaning, but if it it did, I'd think that they would not qualify, since I would take it to mean a musician who specializes in music classified (as above) as ""trad"" - which they don't.   I mean, that's what all of music is. That's what all of art is.   Yes, all artists stand on the shoulders of those who've gone before, but that doesn't make the distinction between ""having influences"", ""borrowing"" and ""stealing"" completely without value, either - even in an idealistic sense.   And that doesn't mean that ""all art is"" is borrowing and stealing - that's a gross oversimplification."
bobdylan,2uspne,SuperDane,2,Sat Feb 7 00:43:02 2015 UTC,"Lol. Thievin Clapton then, and Led Zeppelin, and Guthrie, and Robert Johnson. We have a unbelievably narrow conception of copyright now that big money is associated with it. Had we been so narrow-minded before, I doubt half our art would have been done the way it is."
bobdylan,2uspne,hokaloskagathos,-2,Thu Feb 5 01:10:20 2015 UTC,"Why even post this?  Every rock and roll act stole from blues acts, and blues acts stole from gospel and gospel from somewhere else and so forth and so on.  Jesus Christ people are quite arrogant if they truly think they created a melody or rhythm of thin air."
bobdylan,2uspne,SuperDane,5,Thu Feb 5 14:02:08 2015 UTC,Because it is interesting to know where the melodies come from.
bobdylan,2uspne,Thelonious_Cube,-2,Thu Feb 5 17:47:06 2015 UTC,"They don't come from anywhere.  2000 years ago someone played the damn melody, then 1300 years before that someone else did."

It creates this haunting atmosphere where the notes and the music seem to just droop down in this cascade of blue; the production is impeccable. Every song sounds kinda similar to each other but different enough at the same time, so listening to the whole record is this unified experience.  It really did knock me right off my socks. I figure you have to already be a fan of that type of music to enjoy it - I agree with one reviewer who called it a ""late-night record"". I definitely think it captures that moment past midnight where everything is still and it all matters a thousandfold more than it does when the sun is out. It's reflective, it's sorrowful but there's this sweetness to it, this gentle appreciation for even feeling those feelings in the first place and Dylan guides you through those feelings in the song with his voice."

bobdylan,2ukwrc,porter_esq,1 point,Tue Feb 3 00:59:30 2015 UTC,One of Dylan's best performances of the 90s and his career for that matter.
bobdylan,2ukwrc,DylanFloyd,3,Tue Feb 3 14:33:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I had forgotten how great that was. What a marvel Dylan is, that with a catalog so bloated with world-famous songs, songs that have changed the face of popular culture, songs that have won Grammies and Oscars, songs that have become part of the popular vernacular in a way with which only Shakespeare's dialogue can compare, he can pull out a dark horse, performed maybe three times in his career, recorded once, and make it a legendary highlight of such a high-profile event. No one else."
bobdylan,2ukwrc,gwmercure,2,Tue Feb 3 14:56:39 2015 UTC,"What's crazy is apparently, Old Blue Eyes himself requested the song. In a concert full of artists performing their renditions of Frank's repertoire, to have Dylan performing one of his own songs for Frank is telling. MOJO magazine says it's Dylan's version of ""My Way,"" and maybe that's true, but in any case, it's a moving performance, and a very personal one at that."

I can imagine the lyrics being merely the P.S. at the end of a larger letter that, as time goes on, gets shorter and more distant.

bobdylan,2ug2ev,dorky2,11,Sun Feb 1 22:35:37 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily the saddest, but I think ""Shooting Star"" is worth mentioning in this context."
bobdylan,2ug2ev,chapinha,5,Mon Feb 2 01:38:25 2015 UTC,I think the MTV Unplugged version gets across the sadness better. The build up of excitement during the bridge contrasted with the disappointed final chorus comes through a lot clearer than the studio version.
bobdylan,2ug2ev,normcaterson,11,Mon Feb 2 14:11:38 2015 UTC,"A psychiatrist acquaintance of mine once described 'Not Dark Yet' as the ""most accurate portrayal of depression ever heard in a song"". Seeing as he is not even a great Dylan fan, I shall have to go with that.   Of course, there are heart-breaking live renditions of other songs ('76 'If You See Her', 'You're a Big Girl Now' and the early 90s Australian versions of 'Desolation Row' are the ones that immediately spring to mind) but as a song in itself, I'd have to go with 'Not Dark Yet'."
bobdylan,2ug2ev,MahoganyLover,2,Mon Feb 2 01:41:10 2015 UTC,"I go with Not Dark Yet as my number one.  As though it's not as bad as it can get, but soon it will, and admitting things are headed that way are the heaviest point of it.  And ""she wrote me a letter and wrote it so kind, she put down in writing what was in her mind.""  That kind acceptance of devastation is what makes it so, almost, unbearable.   To deny things or get angry is one thing but to be so nice about something like... I can't think of many other songs like that."

bobdylan,2ug2ev,willington123,17,Tue Feb 3 02:33:14 2015 UTC,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again:  The acoustic version of ""Idiot Wind"" perfectly counters the blistering rage in the studio version by remaining solemn and resigned, though both versions can cut you to the core. On the acoustic one, though, if the lyrics moving, essentially, from ""Fuck you"" to ""Fuck the both of us"" don't get you, the extended harmonica solo that closes the song should do the trick. Those last couple of licks contain some of the strongest pathos Dylan's ever committed to acetate, and he doesn't even use his words."

I remember a few years ago hearing a recording on youtube that was supposedly the first live performance of ""Desolation Row"" in front of what sounded like a couple dozen people and they were laughing too.  It makes me think about when he talked about on No Direction Home how sometimes people's first reactions to things are sometimes really odd. And he mentioned how when another artist first performed a song that's now considered an amazing song, no one clapped. (I forgot the name.)"
bobdylan,2ug2ev,meatsbeat,2,Mon Feb 2 14:10:10 2015 UTC,"There some funny lines in there 'I love you, but your strange' for instance, which gets the biggest laugh.    My dad saw Dylan in '66 and said people were laughing a lot at some of the lines in the acoustic set.  For instance 'The jelly faced women says geeze, I can't find my knees' apparently got a laugh from the audience, and I've heard versions where this is the case, despite Visions in that tour being such an intense and heavy song.   I guess for everyone in the audience in both these cases it was the first time hearing these songs and they will have been pretty much hanging on every word (my dad even said the concert he was at in '66 had people with note books jotting down lines they liked) so funny, unexpected lines will get laughs."

bobdylan,2ug2ev,dylanthegrey,1 point,Mon Feb 2 03:46:53 2015 UTC,"Probably because you claim the song is about something with such confidence, as if he said it, or there is no way the song could be about something else.

Everyone doesn't have to be bellering and leaping around all the time. Bob doesn't do that. Bob looks bored singing his songs most of the time live.   Which is not to say how you feel is not valid. You are absolutely entitled to feel how you want about anything.

Two reasons: (1) Not really busy with work, but hey, the Basement tapes... come on. It's not that it's not interesting or anything, but it's too much work. Really. I'm too old to spend hours deciphering what's probably incoherent syllabization anyway, from not-as-studio-quality-as-one-might-wish tapes, over simple tunes that are mostly not very interesting, muscially/guitar-ally speaking. In short: if someone would produce the lyrics, I'll have the chords done in a day or two.... (2) As someone mentioned: I believe I've already done most of the INTERESTING songs from the BT. At least the intersection between interesting and doable....  Ok, there was a #3 as well: (3) I can't really say I think his live work is very interesting these days, and his creative efforts have been sub-par since, dunno, L&T, maybe, so I haven't quite had the motivation to go all-in in a while.

I guess for me what I've loved about his site compared to the regular ultimateguitaresc chart is that he seems to really be listening closely and dissecting every last little detail of the playing. I'm not very good at picking out chords, it would take me a few hours to figure out a section of a song, and it'd probably be wrong.    The subtle things are like the riff from ""Big River (Take 2)"" or ""Folsom Prison Blues"" or Robbie's work on ""All You Have to Do Is Dream (Take 2)"" from the solo to the back beat guitar strikes. Or more simply the chords to 900 Miles From My Home, I'm Alright, or One Too Many Mornings.   Though I can't blame him, he's done a life's work already on that site."

bobdylan,2tf55g,maehren,8,Fri Jan 23 22:44:34 2015 UTC,"To me there is no mystery. The pressures of constant touring, handling the media frenzy, making music, the drugs, etc all led to one strung out, pushed-to-the-limit dude. Then the accident which must have been an awakening as you say, after which it seems reasonable to just step back for awhile. The whole seclusion thing maybe didn't much matter to him at the time anyway, he was still writing and making music, never caring much for media attention and baring his whole life for his fans."
bobdylan,2tf55g,monk_hughes,3,Sat Jan 24 02:29:59 2015 UTC,Completely agree with your synopsis. It's also worth pointing out that Dylan used his seclusion to rediscover himself as a different songwriter with a country sound and Hank Williams white suit image totally at odds with what was popular at the time....Woodstock so wanted Dylan but he wasn't there and had no interest in the counterculture at all even though they adored him.

bobdylan,2tex2q,SurrealistSwimmer,1 point,Sat Jan 24 15:58:36 2015 UTC,"Indeed, it's one of those shows I decided to travel to on a whim. One never knows how the start of a Dylan tour will go: sometimes you get a refreshed eager performance with passion and sometimes it feels like a rusty old truck barely able to move. I've certainly had tour starts where it felt like the latter but, I don't know... the Scandinavian shows are usually quite good.   The night before was nice because it was a small club and the first show after years where he played guitar but, really, it felt like a warm-up gig.   This second night, however, is still one of the best shows I've seen live (and, in terms of experience, probably in my top 3). Focused performance, five songs on guitar and a very strong Don't Think Twice (as seen above), It's Alright Ma, Nettie Moore, Girl From The North Country and, shockingly enough, Country Pie.   Of course, there were both lyrical and guitar flubs, but I think the fact that he was challenged by the guitar led to some very raw renditions."

bobdylan,2t72t7,throe,8,Wed Jan 21 18:34:31 2015 UTC,"In his memoir, Chronicles, Dylan was assumed to be referring to Blood on the Tracks when he wrote: “I would even record an entire album based on Chekhov short stories. Critics thought it was autobiographical – that was fine.” No one was certain whether he was serious about the Chekhov.   I found this really funny. I can't speak to its authenticity since I don't know anything about Chekhov but didn't Dylan make up a lot of what appears in Chronicles?   “’You’re a Big Girl Now,’ well, I read that this was supposed to be about my wife. I wish somebody would ask me first before they go ahead and print stuff like that. I mean, it couldn’t be about anybody else but my wife, right? Stupid and misleading jerks these interpreters sometimes are…I don’t write confessional songs. Emotion’s got nothing to do with it. It only seems so, like it seems that Lawrence Olivier is Hamlet… Well, actually I did write one once and it wasn’t very good—it was a mistake to record it and I regret it… back there somewhere on maybe my third or fourth album.” (He was referring to 1964’s “Ballad in Plain D,” an exploration of his breakup with Suze Rotolo, which he claimed was the one time he ever overtly mined his own emotional trauma for a song: “That one I look back and I say, ‘I must have been a real schmuck to write that.’”)   This is really interesting. I don't think there's any denying that at least some of Blood on the Tracks is a result of Dylan's marriage but it is a good point that we always assume Dylan is talking about himself and his life in every song.   The nine-minute “Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts” is so much a first take that you can hear Dylan realizing in the opening bars that his harmonica is in a different key than he thought and adjusting on the fly.   I'm gonna have to listen for this next time but I'm not a big music guy so maybe I won't be able to notice."

You can hear how great of a guitar picker he was in those gaslight tapes early on in his career, like his take on the cukoo is a pretty bird.   I like those albums, it's just a guy and his guitar covering some songs that he really enjoys. I mean that's why I really enjoyed Neil's A Letter Home, it doesn't get more barebones than that, especially his take on girl from the north country. The way he does it, almost changes the meaning for me, it's like you can hear the spite in his voice, there's always been a little rage in his voice.   Man, tangents, I do them well."

My favorite part has to be when he sings the conversation, not so much for the words, but the delivery is always greatm especially when you're blasting it   She said where you been, I said, nowhere special She said you look different, I said, well, I guess She said you been gone, I said, that's only natural She said are you gonna stay, I said, if you want me to, yesss!     Then the music just drops, and man, how it swells in the background just tops off a stellar performance.

Abandoned Love, an outtake from Desire, sweet Jesus, there are few words that do that song justice. It might just be Bobby's best in my opinion."
bobdylan,2t2a7f,TheDanimal438,5,Tue Jan 20 20:29:01 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you said that as I consider Abandoned Love one of my top 5 favorite Dylan songs. I also think Black Diamond Bay off of Desire is one his underrated gems, but I am also a sucker for Emmylou Harris' backing vocals."
bobdylan,2t2a7f,willington123,5,Tue Jan 20 21:23:52 2015 UTC,"It's so great isn't it? And yeah Black Diamond Bay, as well as Mozambique are both underrated.   Weirdly - though not weird if you're Bobby Dylan - Abandoned Love has only been performed once. He did it at The Other End in NYC, after Ramblin' Jack Elliott coaxed him on to the stage.

bobdylan,2t2a7f,Rule56,3,Thu Jan 22 08:04:18 2015 UTC,"Great album, great stories... I'm big on Black Diamond Bay and just about all of the others too. But to introduce some fodder and some controversy... Is it really a legit ""Bob"" album? How much credit does the listener owe to Jacques Levy? Bob's a storyteller but are these really his stories? (And, no I'm not including Sara in this mix.) Does it matter? - An awesome album is an awesome album but I'm interested in hearing whether it is accurate to include this one in the same category as Blonde on Blonde, Highway 61 Revisited or BOTT?"
bobdylan,2t2a7f,solarandlunar,3,Wed Jan 21 00:16:19 2015 UTC,"Nah, doesn't matter to me. No one else but Bob could have delivered this album."
bobdylan,2t2a7f,SkipBittman,3,Thu Jan 22 02:03:56 2015 UTC,"That's like saying that his first record isn't a Bob Dylan record because they're covers. I think Dylan has been trying to prove that no one owns the stories; it's up to the storyteller to tell 'em his way. I mean, Levy penned them but Bob is really the instrument, no?   It's one of my favourite records of his. The whole gypsy-folk concept along with the imagery of the lyrics is complete insanity! 'Joey', I think, is an amazing song for this purpose. Every time he screams, ""Let ConEdison take the blame!"" I get a shiver in my spine."
bobdylan,2t2a7f,dorky2,2,Thu Jan 22 23:34:50 2015 UTC,"Totally agree and kudos for the neat insight but you raise an interesting point - and I really don't mean to come off like any of this matters, its just great to chat Bob - but I'm not sure the two albums can be fairly compared. I think it is more of a development thing, I guess, because I hear a lot more Bob on Desire (and World Gone Wrong and As Good as I Have Been to You) than I do on ""Bob Dylan"" (if that makes any sense). I don't really have a point to argue but if I were to make one up, does Desire have less edge than the other albums I mentioned, and is that the ""Levy effect"" because that edge seems to return on Street Legal. (Desire does have that edge at times but overall it is not as haunting.)"
bobdylan,2t2a7f,Rule56,2,Fri Jan 23 00:45:19 2015 UTC,"It's a very good, but flawed, album. I really love about half of it (Black Diamond Bay, Sara, Isis, One More Cup of Coffee), and feel ambivalent about the other half.   Word is that at the last minute, Dylan decided to replace Abandoned Love with Joey. This one change, trading (in my opinion) one of his best songs for one of his worst, really hurts it.  Still, it's got a great atmosphere working in its favor. It's one of those albums, like Exile on Main Street, that feels like a place you can visit. And I think it's strengths are strong enough to outweigh its weaknesses."

bobdylan,2sc625,Thelonious_Cube,3,Wed Jan 14 00:05:06 2015 UTC,"All the tracks I've heard so far are outstanding. His voice sounds in the form it was in on Modern Times.

I'm always interested to check out whatever new thing Bobby's into.   He says this about the recording process, which sounds interesting: ""I've wanted to do something like this for a long time but was never brave enough to approach 30-piece complicated arrangements and refine them down for a 5-piece band. That's the key to all these performances. We knew these songs extremely well. It was all done live. Maybe one or two takes. No overdubbing. No vocal booths. No headphones. No separate tracking, and, for the most part, mixed as it was recorded.""  And really, it seems to me like the logical conclusion to a lot of the stuff he's been doing for the last decade, starting with some of those songs on Modern Times, like Spirit on the Water and Beyond the Horizon."

The singer finds himself in Juarez, Mexico, at Easter time, amidst sickness, despair, whores and saints. While there, he encounters corrupt authorities and women of dubious character, named in the song as ""Saint Annie"" and ""sweet Melinda"", before seeking succor in drugs and alcohol. The song establishes a nightmare vision as the singer is influenced by gravity, negativity, sex, drugs, drink, illness, remorse and memory. In the song's final verse, the singer decides he has had enough and finds the means to leave it all behind and head back to New York City, where things may be better"

bobdylan,2rl1py,Roberto23,1 point,Wed Jan 7 09:15:56 2015 UTC,"I remember standing in a library browsing a Dylan book and the author went on for pages about the song Delia, it has a long history. And even though i'm a long time Dylan fan, i was impressed with his guitar playing on 'Frankie and Albert', wondered why he didn't show off his guitar playing a bit more."

bobdylan,2rl1py,heavym,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:29:05 2015 UTC,No one mentioned Another Side Of???  That is a great glimpse into Dylan just immediately before he goes electric.  But knock the electric stuff - Dylan has always been a rock and roller at heart
bobdylan,2rl1py,manthey8989,1 point,Wed Jan 7 12:29:21 2015 UTC,"You will appreciate the electric stuff with time.  But for now, The Freewheelin, and Another Side of Bob Dylan are what you are asking for...but everything that everyone here is saying about Blood on the Tracks I very strongly second...also Bringing it all Back Home was his transition into electric so if you want to start where the electric came from...listen to that one."
bobdylan,2rl1py,solarandlunar,1 point,Wed Jan 7 14:09:46 2015 UTC,"When I read he 'needed help', I thought he meant that he became addicted and his Dylan obsession started screwing with his regular life. Not that it happened to me or anything. Heh. Heheheh. Ahem.  Heh."

bobdylan,2rl1py,andersma,1 point,Sun Jan 11 02:31:34 2015 UTC,"A lot of people here are suggesting Freewheelin, which, seems right up your alley considering you loved Times They Are A-Changin', but I think it's his most overrated album. Definitely get Blood On The Tracks though. Another thing to look at are the acoustic performances from 1966 (there's a bootleg series with a disc full of them), they're the best of the best when it comes to acoustic Dylan.   Bringing It All Back Home and Blonde On Blonde would be great ways for you to appreciate his electric stuff. Both of those albums are sort of a half and half."

The massive number of people in prison in the US, the government and corporations that spy on us and track us. Then he would dropout and move to a rural area, without Internet, live off the grid, raise a family. When he returned to the stage his marriage was in shambles and he would gather some of his old pals together like his old girl friend Lana Del Rey, as well as his friends Ninja and Yolandi and Lupe Fiasco, etc. and form a traveling revue that played small venues. When his marriage ended in divorce he would write a heartbreakingly beautiful Internet only release about it. Then he would alienate most of his fans by converting to Islam and releasing several Islamic albums. After that it's anyone's guess what will happen."

bobdylan,2r8c77,SatantheMagnificent,6,Sat Jan 3 20:19:26 2015 UTC,Not really. There are a few good passages but most of it is just surrealism. Chronicles is infinitely more enjoyable.
bobdylan,2r8c77,grahamlester,6,Sat Jan 3 20:35:22 2015 UTC,"I have an original copy that my uncle owned, but it's pretty hard to read. A lot of babble. Chronicles is a much better read if you're looking to explore Dylan's mind."
bobdylan,2r8c77,62Silvertone,6,Sat Jan 3 20:44:28 2015 UTC,"I don't really get comparing it to Chronicles. They're totally different types of books.   Tarantula is fun to read in chunks. The first time I picked it up, I read all of it. That wasn't a ton of fun. But thinking about it in the context of when Bob wrote it is fun. If you're not up for making it feel like homework, I suggest reading it bit by bit, like a coffee table book."
bobdylan,2r8c77,izimulation,2,Sun Jan 4 19:03:49 2015 UTC,The fake letters are sort of funny but the rest is lame.
bobdylan,2r8c77,PQQKIE,2,Sat Jan 3 21:33:33 2015 UTC,Yes. I believe the book is in need of reappraisal because it is one of the few artistic statements from Bob Dylan that is not operating in the mode of a popular song and because it's a fine chunk of Burroughs-influence postmodernism.
bobdylan,2r8c77,FizzPig,2,Sun Jan 4 18:20:20 2015 UTC,"It's a funny read. I'll pick it up and read a few pages every once in a while. Some of the stuff is really similar to his lyrics on his albums from the mid to late 60s. Some kind of like Visions of Johanna, some more similar to his 115th dream."

bobdylan,2r8c77,willington123,2,Mon Jan 5 12:34:59 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, if you are in Dylan in a big way. It's essentially a whole book in style of Highway 61 and Bringing it all back home's liner notes, it is surrealist. Here is a good article"

bobdylan,2r2l0b,AllHailHeisenberg,5,Fri Jan 2 04:45:03 2015 UTC,"Can't listen to this all right now but this is my favorite type of bootleg. Similar to Peco's Blues, it's just the straight tape from the sessions which is always on when he records and you can hear it all come together. If anyone enjoyed this, look into Peco's Blues. You can literally hear Knocking On Heaven's Door Take form. Or how the all encompassing five note riff from the final theme came about from the guitar player literally playing a random exercise between takes and Dylan going ""I like that! What was that? Do it again."" Few make music like this anymore. Everything is preorchestrated and played to click tracks."

bobdylan,2r2997,AllHailHeisenberg,4,Fri Jan 2 02:44:23 2015 UTC,It was recorded and released on a film soundtrack.
bobdylan,2r2997,62Silvertone,6,Fri Jan 2 04:10:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think it was North Country. Too lazy to google. Movie about a woman who was fighting for equal rights and treatment at a coal mine. The released version really pales in comparison to Tell Tale Signs, in my opinion. And what's weirder, if I recall correctly, the difference between the two is he took the minor chords of the original take (at least I think it was the original take) and made them majors. But instead of playing A minor and playing the relative major C which would make sense, he would play instead of A minor, A major. Really weird."
bobdylan,2r2997,v1s1onsofjohanna,6,Fri Jan 2 04:51:46 2015 UTC,"I'm partial to just about every version on Tell Tale Signs, especially both versions of Mississippi."

bobdylan,2r2997,Dr-Sardonicus,3,Fri Jan 2 11:01:49 2015 UTC,"I keep wondering this because it's an amazing song, imho it's one of the best songs he's ever done"
bobdylan,2r2997,FizzPig,2,Fri Jan 2 23:11:34 2015 UTC,"Interesting to listen to the major key version as opposed to the one on Tell Tale Signs. The lyrics, in my opinion, are much more suited for the minor key version. It's such a contemplative, brooding song. Yet listening to it in the major key is really a trip, and adds an interesting depth to it. I've always found the allusion to the folksong Tell Old Bill/This Morning So Soon interesting. Lyrically, it's a subtle allusion in which the narrator turns to another unnamed character to tell ""Ol' Bill"" that anything is worth a try, the narrator is not alone, and that the hour has come to do or die. In the folksong, it centers around ""Old Bill's"" wife and how Old Bill has a habit of messing around with other women that inevitably gets him killed somehow. In Dylan's tune, there's clearly this anguish in the singer that seems to revolve around someone (likely a woman) that's stuck in his head, as if eating him from the inside out. Interesting concept that Dylan is playing around with. I guess my point--through the rambling--is that the song would've stood on two feet just fine without the allusion to the folk song, but with the inclusion of it, it adds a new dimension and possibly a deeper explanation."

When you say hardly anyone there what is the capacity of the room you see him in and how many people are there.   Also as a deadhead you surely realize that they allowed and encouraged taping of their shows for free trade. Dylan never has.   There are shitloads of bootlegs of Bob more than most other artists who do not encourage taping.

The album was recorded at Jackson Browne's Groove Masters Studios in Santa Monica, California. Dylan wrote all of the songs himself with the exception of the track ""Duquesne Whistle"", which he co-wrote with Robert Hunter.   Tempest was very well received by music critics, who praised its traditional music influences and Dylan's dark lyrics. The album peaked at number three on the Billboard 200.

I'm not sure how true that is, but I took that to mean that Bob Dylan is more influential than he is popular.  I'll say this, though: Bob is going to die one of these days. And when he does, he will be the lead on all the news programs, and his songs will be played on all the radio stations, and his albums will rocket to the top of the charts, and sell probably more than they did during his lifetime.

bobdylan,2qz7tz,mehmehmee,2,Fri Jan 2 19:03:28 2015 UTC,"From the man himself (Chronicles):  ""My mother and my aunt Etta were staying with us and they’d be up early, so I wanted to be up early, too. The next day was overcast and a fog hung in the air. My aunt was in the kitchen and I sat down with her to talk and drink coffee. The radio was playing and morning news was on. I was startled to hear that Pete Maravich, the basketball player, had collapsed on a basketball court in Pasadena, just fell over and never got up. I’d seen Maravich play in New Orleans once, when the Utah Jazz were the New Orleans Jazz. He was something to see — mop of brown hair, floppy socks — the holy terror of the basketball world — high flyin’ — magician of the court. The night I saw him he dribbled the ball with his head, scored a behind the back, no look basket — dribbled the length of the court, threw the ball up off the glass and caught his own pass. He was fantastic. Scored something like thirty-eight points. He could have played blind. Pistol Pete hadn’t played professionally for a while, and he was thought of as forgotten. I hadn’t forgotten about him, though. Some people seem to fade away but then when they are truly gone, it’s like they didn’t fade away at all."""
bobdylan,2qz7tz,willington123,1 point,Tue Jan 6 05:26:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true, when Bobby does depart I think a lot of people will come out of the woodwork and listen to his music.  I imagine a lot of these people will be 'plastic fans', but I guess it will get new people into his music as well!"
bobdylan,2qz7tz,JewyLewis,2,Fri Jan 2 09:37:15 2015 UTC,"You are right (see: Michael Jackson, he died in June and topped the charts with various albums for rest of the year.)  But man, when Bobby goes, I'm going to be distraught. I fear that day so much."
bobdylan,2qz7tz,SirFudge,5,Sat Jan 10 00:39:49 2015 UTC,"Not full? I know that in some arenas in the States, there can be empty spaces, but normally that's more because of inappropriate venue choices. He sold out 3 nights at the Royal Albert Hall and puts on 100 gigs a year, so the demand is there. The only issue with the Never Ending Tour is that as he comes around within 8 months or so again, it's not quite the same touring model as other artists, so immediate demand may be lower.  But Bob has taken on the 'popularity status' of an older artist that still puts out critically acclaimed music but it's just not going to get into the charts, it's not made for that kind of scene. Amongst a certain demographic, he is of course still incredibly popular, but he has taken on a 'legend' moniker almost, so it's not quite as simple as being 'popular' and 'unpopular'. Either way, he's in a lot better place within the music industry than he was 20 years ago.  And I have pretty much every Dylan gig pre-2011 (still catching up!) so if there's any show in particular you want, PM me."
bobdylan,2qz7tz,Imipolex42,5,Thu Jan 1 15:38:23 2015 UTC,"But it is hard to find his shit outside of the released stuff.  I have more high quality recordings of Grateful Dead music than I will be able to listen to in my life. I understand that Dylan was not as praised as a live act, and that he was not as prolific with the live shows, but can anybody help me out with getting some recordings of Dylan's live stuff?   Bob Dylan rivals the Dead as one of the most heavily bootlegged artists in the history of popular music. There's literally thousands of hours of bootlegged live Dylan concerts out there spanning the past fifty years, including some of the most legendary concerts in rock history. You can find most of them on the internet for free. Try torrent sites and the Rare Recordings section of Expecting Rain. (If what you're looking for isn't listed there, just post a request and someone will probably re-upload it for you).   Here are some good guides to live Dylan boots:  http://www.bobsboots.com/ - An ancient 90s site for sure, but definitely an invaluable resource for Dylan collectors. You can search for boots by title, venue, and year. You can't download from this site, but it's a pretty definitive guide to several decades' worth of bootlegs.  http://www.expectingrain.com/ - You need an account to see the aforementioned Rare Recordings section. There are hundreds of concerts ranging from the early '60s to last month. Some of the links are dead but as I said the people at ER are more than willing to re-upload them if you post a request.   A few articles to get you started:  http://ultimateclassicrock.com/bob-dylan-bootleg-albums/  http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-10-best-bob-dylan-bootlegs-20110511?page=3  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan_bootleg_recordings  And, of course, there's plenty of released live Dylan recordings as well. The Bootleg Series Volumes 4 (Live 1966) and 5 (Live 1975) are legendary and absolutely essential, and Hard Rain (1976) and Before the Flood (1974) have lots of great moments.   It sounds like you're only just starting to get into live Dylan, so let me just say I envy you! I remember when I first started listening to live Dylan bootlegs; it was amazing hearing such legendary stuff for the first time. Live Dylan is the best Dylan; the man is such a magnificent performer it's almost impossible for him to play a bad show. (Except for that drunken '91 tour--stay away from that one!). Good luck and have fun!"

bobdylan,2qv3h9,62Silvertone,6,Wed Dec 31 15:56:46 2014 UTC,"Well, a friend of mine told me this story. This was late 90s I believe. Her dad worked at Duke Hospital in Durham, NC, and was outside smoking a cigarette.  Man walks up to him and asks for a smoke. Dad gets a cigarette out and hands it and a lighter to the man. As the man is lighting the cigarette, Dad really looks at him for the first time and it dawns on him.  ""You're Bob Dylan aren't you?"" asks the dad.   Bob hands the lighter back, looks at dad and says, ""Keep it under your hat,"" and walks away."

bobdylan,2qv3h9,62Silvertone,6,Wed Dec 31 17:12:08 2014 UTC,"Not sure how relevant to this thread this anecdote is, but it's pretty funny and characteristic of Dylan. I heard this story from a friend who's tight with Tom Petty.  Apparently Dylan doesn't like being ""lit up"" from the front when he's onstage. Well, at this one show back in the 80s he was doing with Petty, the lighting guy was getting frustrated because a bunch of fans were yelling at him that they could barely see Dylan. So the lighting guy shines one stage light right on Dylan and Dylan marched right off the stage. He sits down next to Tom Petty on a couch backstage and the two of them just sit there and have a smoke, chilling as if they weren't in the middle of a show. Dylan turns to Petty and says: ""Man they got me lit up like Disney World out there."" Petty takes a puff of his cigarette and says ""Bob you ain't never been to Disney"" Dylan just says something like ""You're right"" and he goes back out on stage and finishes the show."

And since Dylan is always trying something different, he's always compared to his other work. Every time he releases something, I try to pretend that it's his first work.   I'm not fascinated by particular works of his as much as with his outlook, his attitude and approaches to his art, the personality of the pieces. That's why I can probably find something to love in everything he does."

bobdylan,2pd7i4,zensunni66,2,Mon Dec 15 16:14:04 2014 UTC,"Claudia Cardinale:       Claudia Cardinale (born 15 April 1938) is a Tunisian-born Sicilian actress who appeared in some of the most prominent European films of the 1960s and 1970s. Notable credits include Luchino Visconti's Rocco and His Brothers (1960) and The Leopard (1963), Philippe de Broca's Cartouche (1963), Federico Fellini's 8½ (1963), and Sergio Leone's epic Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). The majority of Cardinale's films have been either Italian or French.  Outspoken on women's rights causes over the years, Cardinale has been a UNESCO goodwill ambassador for the Defense of Women's Rights since March 2000. In February 2011 the Los Angeles Times Magazine named Cardinale among the 50 most beautiful women in film history.

A Swedish experiment simply called 'Experiment Alone' has done a few episodes on their Youtube channel were the premiss of the show is to see how people act when they do different things alone, for example sing karaoke or go to the bar by themselves. For the last episode they wanted to do something spectacular so theY invited a Swedish TV-host who is an extremely big Dylan fan to get a concert played for him only. This is the result, it's really awesome and you can really see how he enjoys it :)"

I'm sure they're played some tunes to just a couple people in theaters where they were preparing before shows. Or is Dylan that divided from that?

bobdylan,2or2nz,gwmercure,4,Wed Dec 10 01:14:37 2014 UTC,"Nope he did not, but the music industry operated in a completely different way back then. Ironically it was Dylan who was THE major influence in changing away from singers performing songs written by professional song writers which had been given to them by A&R men.  I may be mistaken, but I believe that the tunes Dylan is covering here were given to (or specifically written for) Sinatra to initially record, and then chart with. Since Sinatra was the first singer to record these songs he is associated with them being ""his"" songs.  The same thing applies to Elvis. As far I know Elvis did not write any of the songs he recorded (and even covered other artist versions of songs) but many tunes, such as Hound Dog or Jailhouse Rock are associated as ""Elvis songs."""

Some of them, perhaps, but certainly not all.  In fact I'm pretty sure other singers had bigger hits with Some Enchanted Evening (Mario Lanza - written for the stage - ""South Pacific"" I think), Autumn Leaves (originally French) and What'll I Do? (Johnny Mathis) and none of those are songs that most people into that genre would associate particularly with Frank.  Others (Stay With Me for certain) were given first to Frank and are associated strongly with him   but many tunes, such as Hound Dog or Jailhouse Rock are associated as ""Elvis songs.""

bobdylan,2or2nz,Thelonious_Cube,1 point,Wed Dec 10 19:34:55 2014 UTC,"Agreed. Clearly Dylan was not the only one, nor the first one, but he has been widely credited as the greatest single influence in killing off the Brill Building.  It was Dylan who directly influenced John Lennon to move toward more personal and introspective lyrics. It's my opinion that it wasn't so much the fact they Dylan wrote his own lyrics as what and how he wrote.   While many predecessors wrote their own lyrics, Dylan began writing in a more deeply introspective and very personal way vs. the more traditional, June, Spoon, Moon style of Holly or the humorous miniatures of Chuck Berry. That's not to diminish either one's work, just a statement of the difference in style. I personally love, and admire, both Holly and Berry's music and lyrics."

You certainly wouldn't call it a ""Max Martin and Rami Yacoub cover""  ""Cover of"" generally refers the hit version or the version that was the most likely influence (you could, for example, cover Burl Ives' Froggie Went A-Courtin' rather than The Wiggles' version or Chubby Parker's).  It's actually a pretty loosely defined term.  So I would say ""Sinatra covers"" is entirely appropriate"
bobdylan,2or2nz,Thelonious_Cube,1 point,Wed Dec 10 19:44:00 2014 UTC,"I guess I would just go with ""Dylan is putting out an album of Standards"" instead."

bobdylan,2or2nz,Thelonious_Cube,1 point,Wed Dec 10 20:50:54 2014 UTC,"You're right, and it seems to be an album of Sinatra covers. But neither the statement at large from the record company nor Dylan's statement included within it mentions Sinatra. Sinatra's name was attached in the responses to the announcement. Some of these songs may be better known for the versions recorded by acts other than Sinatra.   Whatever it is, his recording it at all is our greatest songwriter's greatest tribute to song, and I can't wait to hear it."

bobdylan,2org2t,autowikibot,2,Tue Dec 9 16:01:36 2014 UTC,"Let Me Die In My Footsteps:       Let Me Die in My Footsteps is a song written by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan in February 1962.  The song was selected for the original sequence of Dylan's 1963 album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, but was replaced by ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall"".  This version was recorded at Columbia studios on April 25, 1962, during the first Freewheelin' session, and was subsequently released in March 1991 on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991.    A later version, recorded as a demo for M. Witmark & Sons publishing company in December 1962, was released in October 2010 on The Bootleg Series Vol. 9 – The Witmark Demos: 1962–1964.    The song's first release, however, was in September 1963 on The Broadside Ballads, Vol. 1, an album of topical songs compiled by folk musician Pete Seeger and Sis Cunningham, publisher of Broadside magazine. This version was recorded on January 24, 1963, with Dylan performing as ""Blind Boy Grunt"" (for contractual reasons), backed by his friend Happy Traum.  Broadside had published the song's lyrics under its original title, ""I Will Not Go Down Under the Ground"", in the magazine's third issue in April 1962.

The 2CD ""Raw"" set is a great compilation, but does leave out some significant things.  The original 1975 album has its charm, but it's effectively superseded by these new releases.  If the money's not a problem, get the 6CD version - you'll eventually want it all anyway - but listen to the main items (those on Raw and a few other crucial tracks) first.

You know personally, I think this entire album is completely overlooked - sure it's pretty straightforward Roots-rock, but musically I'd say it's the best album Bobby's ever done. The Band, and especially some of RR's guitar playing, are incredible.  Lyrically, there are some bloody superb songs - hell, all of them are great - Hazel, Dirge, Wedding Song and Forever Young (the faster version) are the picks for me.  As for it above BoB, don't get me wrong I love BoB but I never really connected with it as much as others have I suppose. I'm not entirely sure why, I love all of the live '66 - to which I recently procured a copy of a nice bootleg - but the album itself I don't know.   Oh, and as for the Forever Young version, I'm more partial to the faster version on Planet Waves, though I do love the sort of middling speed one on Biograph!"

It is possible that in preparing the album, there were some subjects, even entire songs, culled from Bob's back pages.   Dylan's occasional insistence that certain songs or albums were not ""about"" what they seemed to be about (mortality, on TOoM; his marriage on BotT) has been at best a mystery and at worst a disappointment to me: if others and I can relate to SToF as being about the end of his relationship with Suze, and TOoM a meditation on mortality, and if we can read so much of his other material without the fourth wall, why not?

bobdylan,2odiw8,willington123,1 point,Sun Dec 7 00:36:31 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah. One of my memories of that day is being in an icy panic, rushing from work to pick up my (then a toddler) son at daycare at the Jewish Community Center and get him home. Still, I stopped at a music store on the way home and picked up the album I had been looking forward to for four years. Played it as soon as I got home, still glued to the TV. I remember watching the events in Manhattan near noon, talking with the baby-mama, when suddenly she stops and says ""is that a Bob Dylan song you can dance to????"" referring to Summer Days.   Also, it was impossible not to read it this way on that day, but many lines on L&T eerily echo the events:   Sky full of fire, Pain pouring down; Well the fog's so thick you can't spy the land; If it's information you want, you can get it from the police; I'm leaving in the morning, as soon as the dark clouds lift; Today has been a sad and lonesome day, I'm just sitting here thinking with my mind a million miles away; Tryin' to bully you, strong-arm you, inspire you with fear; They say times are hard, if you don't believe it you can follow your nose; They all got outta here any way they could; Pretty much all of High Water (For Charley Patton); Well, I'm stranded in the city that never sleeps; I'm avoidin' the south side the best I can; When I left my home the sky split open wide; Some things are too terrible to be true, I won't come here no more if it bothers you. There's a Southern Pacific leaving at 9:45: I'm havin' a hard time believin' some people will ever arrive; I'm here to create the new imperial empire, I'm gonna do whatever circumstances require..."

bobdylan,2odiw8,RichHixson,1 point,Sat Dec 6 19:58:42 2014 UTC,"I don't think you've taken my statement in the spirit with which it was rendered.

I don't think that my comment presented anything other than opinions. I do think that you take this matter a great deal more seriously than I do. I'm sorry to have provoked such hostility. I'm sorry that it will not cause less hostility when I tell you that I will relate to and engage Blood on the Tracks however I relate to and engage it, and that in that way it will be about whatever I want it to be about."
bobdylan,2odiw8,gwmercure,1 point,Sat Dec 6 20:54:25 2014 UTC,"Clinton Heylin sure seems to think the song is about Suze, pointing to the song's subtitle in Dylan's notebook (""4th Street Affair"") and the fact that Dylan actually added Suze's name while singing it live in 1981 (Earl's Court, London)."
bobdylan,2odiw8,litewo,1 point,Sun Dec 7 15:42:51 2014 UTC,"Heylin has been known to be utterly dismissive of anything but his own opinions. Perhaps the best quote I've read about Heylin is ""Dylan might have been there – but only Heylin knows what actually happened."" From The Independent.   I also would put too much credence into the fact that Dylan used Suze's name once while performing the song. As any Dylan fan knows he regularly changes the lyrics of his songs during live performances."

bobdylan,2obiwj,youtubefactsbot,8,Sat Dec 6 02:53:29 2014 UTC,"He does his own thing. He never played anywhere for Levon Helm either. It is probably a combination of what /u/showbizkid and /u/piney said. He probably does his tributes by playing their songs at his shows, if he feels like it. I know he's played The Weight live. He played on the Paul McCartney tribute album that just came out. He played at Concert for Bangladesh, so we know he had good relations with George.   Anyway, he's a strange guy. I wouldn't try to understand him too much."
bobdylan,2obiwj,Weis,6,Fri Dec 5 03:23:58 2014 UTC,Bob was booked to play Madison Square Gardens that same night as part of his tour. Before the Concert for George had even been announced Dylan had sold out the Garden and was committed legally to the gig. That's my understanding of the way it played out.

bobdylan,2obiwj,DylanFloyd,7,Fri Dec 5 13:13:57 2014 UTC,"Nobody knows.    Bob Dylan has never been one to do what's expected of him.  George wasn't going to be there obviously, so he'd be playing for everyone else left behind who felt Bob should be there, and what would that prove? And why does he owe them that?  Bob is also a very private person.  I'm sure he was square with George at the end - and if he wasn't, how would playing this show change things?  Clapton was the bandleader for the concert, and I'm trying to think of the last time Bob Dylan played live for the camera in a situation where he was not backed by a band of his choosing.  It's been a good long while if ever.  Bob had just completed a leg of his Never Ending Tour the week before and maybe he just wasn't up for it. He did mention the tribute from the stage at Madison Square Garden a couple weeks before, as an introduction to his performance of Something."

bobdylan,2nydzv,nostrilz,6,Mon Dec 1 17:12:33 2014 UTC,"I think you're right about arthritis, but it's more of a back problem than something in the fingers : the guitar is too heavy for him to lift during a whole show, hence why he only ever does a song or two with it."
bobdylan,2nydzv,Jashin23,3,Mon Dec 1 19:28:42 2014 UTC,"I'd agree with this. There's no doubt he's larger than life, but let's keep in mind he's always been a pretty small-statured man. Not very tall, and quite thin.  I remember when I first got close enough to see the twinkle in his eyes as he delivered some if his brilliant lines. I was near the front row of standing room in an arena show in Seattle in 2009. I was shocked at how tiny and frail he looked, even as I was looking up at him. My hero is human, and he's getting very old. I'm pretty sure the weight of a guitar would be too much for him for several hours per show, especially with how much touring he still does.  Plus, his touring band is pretty damn amazing."
bobdylan,2nydzv,privatebadger,1 point,Tue Dec 2 06:01:28 2014 UTC,"I'm on the fence about this one. If this were the case, he could play guitar sitting down, which wouldn't be any different from sitting down to play the keys. Plus, one of his recent hobbies is arranging and welding pieces of heavy scrap iron.   But maybe back problems are behind it all. Maybe he's self-conscious that playing guitar sitting down would make him look old, and maybe he has helpers do the heavy lifting in his metal sculpture work. It's an angle I hadn't considered before."
bobdylan,2nydzv,gwmercure,6,Tue Dec 2 15:45:19 2014 UTC,"The official answer is that he was unable to find a touring piano player who understood how he wanted the songs played (the old triplets thing), so he does it himself. That's the official answer, from a fairly recent interview, though I don't have a source.  I play piano and guitar, and I find differences in how they impact the hands. I have physical issues similar to the ones suggested, and they make the guitar difficult to play. I think, though, that if he were so impaired that he was unable to play the guitar, he would also be unable to play long sets at the piano two hundred nights per year. I think he just wants to play piano. Regular reinvention has always been his only constant, so it's easy to accept that he almost completely abandons the guitar for the piano."
bobdylan,2nydzv,mehmehmee,3,Mon Dec 1 22:11:02 2014 UTC,Can anybody find the source of the official answer?  Edit: http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-dylans-america-20090514?page=3
bobdylan,2nydzv,62Silvertone,3,Wed Dec 3 00:35:05 2014 UTC,Probably because he has much better guitar players in his band. If Charley Sexton was in my band I wouldn't play guitar either.
bobdylan,2nydzv,JewyLewis,2,Thu Dec 4 01:07:06 2014 UTC,"Could be arthritis. I always figured he got bored of playing the same songs on guitar at the shows, so switched to piano.  But the arthritis thing makes sense. Would piano be less of a strain? I play guitar, can bang some chords out on the piano (like a young Dylan, only in key of c) but can't really speak for difficulty of playing piano with arthritis."
bobdylan,2nydzv,JewyLewis,1 point,Mon Dec 1 17:51:02 2014 UTC,"Maybe pressing piano keys is easier than fingering a fretboard. I'm not sure either. I remember a few years ago he started playing live again with a Duesenberg electric guitar, plucking out occasional melodies with a big fat low tone. But that was only for a couple songs at a time and it certainly didn't last."

Edit: Couldn't find a YouTube video but here's one nonetheless - https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=2010243904869&permPage=1"

When you see him whacked out in early interviews it's amphetamines.   I've never really heard about Bob doing heroin"
bobdylan,2nn3oa,CatMadeOfFur,2,Fri Nov 28 20:02:09 2014 UTC,"It has been a few years and i can pull some sources, but I believe bob never played Woodstock for this reason.  He lived in Woodstock with his first wife, Sara. At that time he had four kids under their roof (Jakob was born in '69). The festival wasn't held in Woodstock but a town over, that didn't stop people from taking a pilgrimage to see Bob Dylan. Most of the time he would meet then sheen the road. However people made it onto the property and a gent got into their bedroom once. Which lead to bob having a gun on hand. I can't remember the full quote but when quizzed on the subject he did not want to play for hippies. He played the isle of Wight's festival instead."

""Dylan gives a major interview for Westwood One to form part of a three hour radio special called Dylan On Dylan which was broadcast throughout America. The conversation is interspersed with his songs. It is conducted at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in New York by Bert Kleinman (BK) and Artie Mogul (AM) (who signed Dylan up with Witmark in 1962) sometime during the Summer of 1984, shortly after Dylan’s return from the European tour, but was not broadcast on FM until later in the year, commencing on November 13 and then at different times at different locations through the U.S."""
bobdylan,2nigt9,Zolathan,7,Wed Nov 26 20:52:10 2014 UTC,"I don't have any figures, but I would expect that he is certainly popular enough in Germany to tour there regularly. His music has been recorded in German; his world tours since the seventies have usually included stops in Germany; he played a nineteen-song set in Munich last July. I think he's popular everywhere, except at Joni Mitchell's house."

She's got a crusty ego."

bobdylan,2nigt9,gwmercure,2,Thu Nov 27 00:12:40 2014 UTC,"Yes and Yes. The old generation are certainly big fans of Bob Dylan. I was in Hamburg last year on Dylan's concert and there was full house attendance. I was in kind of side stand that was higher than other seats and I could see all the audience below were bald or white haired. I remember there were only few young people including me (23 years) and most of the youth were foreigners. He is certainly famous and well regarded but the current generation in Germany has a different taste in music and hence, Bob is not so well known among them."

bobdylan,2n8s9q,ThinWildMercury1,9,Mon Nov 24 12:18:55 2014 UTC,"His music never strayed far from religion from the get go.  I personally enjoy his ""religious"" period albums.  Pressing on from Saved is just one example of an excellent song from that time.  I happen to like Dylan during any period he has made music."
bobdylan,2n8s9q,ObdwellaX,7,Mon Nov 24 09:31:41 2014 UTC,"In my opinion, the gospel period (and, to a lesser extent, Infidels) shows a Dylan oscillating between an inner quest for meaning and a discourse that has clearly been forced upon him. I find the songs derived from the former most poignant, but the latter irritates me because it seems that some proselyte is speaking through Dylan and I don't like that at all...  If you want an example, I love Every Grain of Sand, but Property of Jesus just seems an odd attempt at some self-justification.  What I find most striking as a whole, however, is that Dylan's conversion to hard-edged Christianism coincides with an assessment of nationalism, so to speak. If you take Slow Train Coming, for instance, it's really astounding how he intertwines God's judgement on the misbehaving men with mentions of the need for America to take back its destiny in its own hands (Sheiks walking around like kings /... Deciding America's future from Amsterdam and Paris). It's the same thing in Infidels, where he starts with the Jesus-like figure if Jokerman and follows later on with Union Sundown, about outsourcing industry to the thirld world. As a European, it is most interesting to see that Dylan associates himself with the long tradition that sees America as the new City of God, but with a degree of disappointment that enables him to conjure up the God of punishment from the old testament, that is more familiar to him given his roots.  As you see, I reckon that this period is not any less interesting than the other eras, and I hope I didn't come off as pedantic with this wall of text : I was just trying to formalize the thoughts I've been having about this."

Given the possibility that God actually does exist and assuming an infinite gain or loss associated with belief or unbelief in said God (as represented by an eternity in heaven or hell), a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God.

bobdylan,2muakk,whatadaythatwas,1 point,Wed Nov 26 03:22:02 2014 UTC,"It depends whether or not you prefer a more modern mastering job. I'm pretty sure they were done at Sterling Sound - which, in my opinion, does a pretty good job cleaning up and compressing Dylan's latest bootlegs while still retaining a good dynamic range. That being said, the safety tapes are always fun because they're actually the real, raw deal that is the reason we like the Basement Tapes in the first place.  The track ""I'm Not There"" is definitely worth the new purchase alone perhaps though. The vocal was panned to the center like it belongs. ""Santa-Fe"" sounds slightly less shitty as it did on the Bootlegs 1-3.  Edit: Actually, I take that back. It seems it was mastered at The E Room and Battery Studios."

It feels sorta like a bridge between the psychedelic/garage rock sound of the 66 tour, and the enigmatic dusty-cabin folk sound of most of the set and John Wesley Harding."

Later Richard Manuel would come along and write his own line and the two would go back and forth like this.  Are these ""found lyrics"" from that typewriter or are they solely Dylan's alone?"

bobdylan,2lzcrk,RichHixson,7,Tue Nov 11 17:18:05 2014 UTC,Live stuff from the neverending tour. Not gonna sell as well unfortunately but I'd love to hear it professionally produced.  Tom Petty 86-87 tour was awesome would love to have something from that. Tho they did put out the concert video. There's a lot more.
bobdylan,2lzcrk,RightWingersSuck,4,Tue Nov 11 17:29:30 2014 UTC,I would do anything to hear Bob sing 'Across The Borderline' on a bootleg series
bobdylan,2lzcrk,BillyShears17,3,Tue Nov 11 17:54:46 2014 UTC,Yeah.   Here's one with the heartbreakers  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0iTXU8bSpk
bobdylan,2lzcrk,RightWingersSuck,2,Tue Nov 11 18:00:46 2014 UTC,Yeah. Thats the one im referencing. Is there any studio versions of it?
bobdylan,2lzcrk,BillyShears17,2,Tue Nov 11 18:30:18 2014 UTC,"Willie nelson has a studio version it's the name of the album, I think that's the same record with the duet with bob on heartland.

bobdylan,2lzcrk,RightWingersSuck,2,Tue Nov 11 18:58:00 2014 UTC,"Came here to see this. More than 25 years of Never Ending Tour - there are a lot of treasures there. Volume 8 gave us the tiniest of insights, and I want more."
bobdylan,2lzcrk,CaptainDread,2,Wed Nov 12 00:12:06 2014 UTC,"100% Agree. There are so many ways they could go with this: a 3-CD ""best of the never ending tour"" release, or a whole series of complete concerts in the style of the Grateful Dead's ""Dick's Pick's"" series, or just a choice concert one-off.    Personally, I love his live stuff circa 2001 and would love to see an official live release of concert material from that time."
bobdylan,2lzcrk,glibrar,8,Thu Nov 20 02:47:19 2014 UTC,"I would like a ""de-80's-fied"" bootleg series that revolves around Infidels, Empire Burlesque, and Knocked Out Loaded. I would love to hear 'Maybe Someday' without the background singers. I believe those albums are lyrically great but the production of the time has made them age terribly. I mean, they gave us a taste in Bootlegs 1-3 with 'When The Night Comes Falling From The Sky' and 'Someone's Got Hold of My Heart' I dont know. Maybe because Infidels is my favorite album, I would like to hear more. Especially a official release of 'Blind Willie McTell' band version.  TL;DR Bob Dylans 80's album ""unplugged"""
bobdylan,2lzcrk,BillyShears17,3,Tue Nov 11 17:54:05 2014 UTC,100% with you on this. Good idea.
bobdylan,2lzcrk,nostrilz,3,Tue Nov 11 19:42:43 2014 UTC,Blood on the Tracks seems like the most likely. Especially with that alt. version of Meet Me in the Morning as the B-side to Duquesne Whistle. Columbia has also hinted at releasing the Blonde on Blonde sessions in the future.
bobdylan,2lzcrk,taylorharrison,3,Tue Nov 11 17:51:20 2014 UTC,"Oh man, if they'd release Blonde On Blonde sessions, I'd be sooo happy."
bobdylan,2lzcrk,AllHailHeisenberg,3,Wed Nov 12 01:42:53 2014 UTC,"The BOTT bootleg set is almost certainly going to be the best release, but as for a 'time' that I'd like to see covered by the series...  Yeah something NET tour related - maybe even, something from Bobby's folk albums from the 1990s, up to World Gone Wrong.  I don't think they'd be too much public interest in it, but it's honestly one of my favourite periods of his!"
bobdylan,2lzcrk,willington123,2,Tue Nov 11 20:37:10 2014 UTC,All I want is 'I'm Cold' and those other rumored tracks from 77.  That's the Dylan Holy Grail as far as I'm concerned.

All of Rhiannon Giddens' tracks are good. Her solo version of ""Lost on the River"" is much better than  Elvis Costello's version. In general this is a strong album. T Bone Burnett's production is a little sterile and ""NPR like"" for my tastes, but I'd recommend this album for Dylan fans."
bobdylan,2lx618,strangerzero,1 point,Tue Nov 11 09:49:03 2014 UTC,"""Sterile"" isn't exactly an adjective I'd imagine being used to describe T-Bone Burnett. I feel his production is almost exactly the opposite - tons of bleed, cheap mics, analog tape and board... everything is done in a way that's fairly ""old school"" Capitol Records style."
bobdylan,2lx618,Mrgreen428,1 point,Tue Nov 11 17:04:17 2014 UTC,"Maybe that is the wrong word, but there is something too slick and perfect about his production to my tastes. I think most of these songs could benefit from a little more looseness. The record often sounds like the style of production that is used on new country records. It's too commercial for my tastes."
bobdylan,2lx618,strangerzero,1 point,Tue Nov 11 22:15:34 2014 UTC,"I still feel like I disagree completely with your description. The way in which they are recorded is so antithetical to modern country and utilize the same techniques from the 1960s. They aren't as lo-fi as the actual basement tapes perhaps - they're recorded on 24 track rather than 4 but still way closer than something like this straight from Nashville: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxVKTwAkv1k  And speaking of 4-track, I believe the stuff he recorded for O Brother Where Art Thou was all done on 4 track tape."

I'm seeing him tonight, and though I know what songs to expect and have seen Dylan twice before, I'm just pumped to be in his presence again and see how he brings it all to the table. It's so fortunate that Tempest was such a good album, too-- I love having the chance to see Dylan perform songs as he releases them, and his Tempest songs are gnarly live!"

bobdylan,2ls61p,Murder_Ballads,3,Sun Nov 9 20:52:26 2014 UTC,The Cadillac is awesome. The atmosphere of it is incredible and his bluesy style gives it that sort of Old Chicago feel. It's a pretty small theatre so all seats are good. I was 9th row which was perfect. I couldn't let you know about parking as I stayed with my uncle and just took the train there and back.

It got hard to go. He changes all the songs, sometimes I think they're making it up as they go. He doesn't sound great. Usually doesn't play too long.  It was a sad day when I wanted to be somewhere else.   I'll always be a huge fan. Glad I got to see him.   Having knowing what I know now, I'd still go see him if I had never before."

bobdylan,2lp6y6,RakeRocter,3,Wed Nov 12 07:26:58 2014 UTC,Yes.  I like that he doesn't monotonously play the same songs the same way over and over again.  Part of the fun of modern Dylan shows is figuring out what song he's playing.  Just don't go expecting original studio versions of anything.
bobdylan,2lp6y6,Amerikaner,2,Sun Nov 9 00:12:00 2014 UTC,... I saw him a couple years ago when he was in town and he was amazing. I can't wait to see him again at the end of the month.
bobdylan,2lp6y6,Damoratis,2,Sat Nov 8 20:33:33 2014 UTC,"I saw Bob last June and it was one of the best shows I've ever seen. Dylan was on form, the whole show was perfectly themed and his harmonica playing was worth the admission price alone.   I also saw the Pretenders a few years ago and they were a great night out. Chrissie Hynde was outstanding and they played all the hits interspersed with some newer stuff. Either way your choices are good however Dylans show is pretty special."
bobdylan,2lp6y6,showbizkid,2,Sun Nov 9 00:04:26 2014 UTC,"Well, the Pretenders won't always be touring, and Dylanx and his band will be playing us out til the end of time, however close or far off that may be."

I think maybe the last time I saw him live was in the late 2000s, and at that show he seemed to be specifically toying with turning most words into unintelligible slurs/mumbles/grumbles/growls.

I'm in no way saying Bob owed him or Levon was expecting him to come or anything like that. I'm just curious as to why he never showed up.
bobdylan,2lhps4,justahunk,1 point,Thu Nov 6 18:09:57 2014 UTC,"Do you show up to every work party of every acquaintance you've had for the past 40 years? No, you have a career, and a family & your interests and personal life has gone in different directions.  Add to that that when you're famous, not only does everything have to be arranged through managers, lawyers, tour managers, publicists, etc., you are also held responsible if unwanted press shows up or all of the attention from the stars (such as Levon) gets diverted due to your presence,etc.  When you reach the level of fame that Dylan has, you lose a tremendous amount of freedom. You can't just ""do what you want to do"". Every action has a thousand reactions. One wrong move could cost dozens of people their careers.    You've simplified a very complex situation."
bobdylan,2lhps4,strangerzero,1 point,Fri Nov 7 02:36:25 2014 UTC,"On the contrary, I think you've complicated a rather simple appearance. Its Bob Dylan. I don't think he has a troop full of managers and lawyers who guide his every move. He does what he wants. If he didn't feel like going for whatever personal reason like not wanting to revisit the past that's one thing but I don't think its accurate at all to say he didn't go because he was advised not to. Bob of all people wouldnt want to let fame dictate his actions. Also its not some random event that he would have come upon by chance. It was a pretty big deal for Levon in the last stretch of his life. You talk like Levon was a guy Bob played with a couple times and forgot.  He was a major part of Bob's sound back in the day and a major part of music as a whole."

bobdylan,2lcnys,willington123,2,Wed Nov 5 19:31:03 2014 UTC,"This is awesome, dude.   Though I've always wondered whether the 'Genuine' release was the same as 'A Tree With Roots' - as in, do they have the same track listing only under different boot names, or is one more complete than the other?"
bobdylan,2lcnys,litewo,4,Wed Nov 5 20:04:58 2014 UTC,"A Tree With Roots is basically a remastered version of the 'Genuine' 5-disc set and was a little more complete. I think the only song added was Come All Ye Fair and Tender Ladies, which sounds much better on the new official release, along with everything else.   The new release pretty much makes these early bootlegs obsolete with one minor exception—for some reason they edited out the part of See You Later, Allen Ginsberg where Richard Manuel makes Dylan crack up by changing the word to Allen Ginsberg. Maybe they were avoiding adding a songwriting credit to much a minor song?"
bobdylan,2lcnys,willington123,2,Wed Nov 5 22:31:10 2014 UTC,"Ah okay, thanks for clearing that up, man.   I must admit though, I'm going to miss 'A Tree With Roots' - don't get me wrong the remastered BT is probably incredible - I haven't listened to it yet, as I've long preordered the vinyl release, and the release has been pushed back - Roots, although, not great in quality, to me is how the BT should sound; it shouldn't sound entirely 'clean', it should have a little interference, and a few nuances that keep it a little bit rough.  Saying that however, I am incredibly pumped for my listen of the new BT!"

bobdylan,2kdq78,redditguy001,8,Sun Oct 26 16:57:29 2014 UTC,"Not me, but my uncle used to know him to some degree. Back in the mid 1960s my uncle had the opportunity to travel around to various folk festivals and whatnot with American folklorist Ralph Rinzler. Rinzler was, amongst other things, a curator for the Smithsonian Folkways project, organizer of various folk festivals, field recorder and archivist for the Newport Folk Festival and all sorts of other stuff. He would organize concerts featuring Dylan and other folkies of the day, is credited with ""discovering"" Howlin' Wolf and bringing him to the 1966 Newport festival (which my uncle was also present for -- said the guy had enormous hands and would play back any melody you could sing him note for note on the guitar on command) and was in a group called the Greenbriar Boys. You can Google him and find pictures of him with Dylan, Pete Seeger, Doc Watson, Bill Monroe, you name it. A short bio of Rinzler can be found at http://www.folklife.si.edu/center/legacy/rinzler.aspx .  Anyways, my uncle traveled with Rinzler to all sorts of festivals and the after parties and all manner of events. Dylan was at several of these parties and they met on various occasions. He said he recalled that Dylan was generally pretty quiet and reserved and kept to himself. He'd stand off to the side drinking a beer or whatever, watch what was going on, that sort of thing. At one particular party, Dylan was enamoured that the Clancy brothers were there and he sort of barricaded himself in a room upstairs from the party. At some point he yelled downstairs for ""Willy"" to come up and nobody knew who he was talking about except for a handful of folks who knew Liam Clancy was know to close friends as Willy. (""Liam"" being short for ""William"".) Rinzler, or someone in the know, found Liam and let him know Dylan was looking for him and off he went. I guess they drank together for a while and weren't seen too much for the rest of the night.   My uncle didn't know Dylan too well but they knew each other to see each other sort of thing. My uncle was 16 or 17 at the time and Dylan would have been 24 or so at the time. Close enough in age to frequent the same parties, basically, especially with my uncle bouncing around with Rinzler.   Other tales and whatevs since I'm writing it down.    apparently my uncle at least once had to hold a bucket for Joan Baez to throw up in during a show. She used to get terribly nervous performing and was known to throw up. Rinzler had the honour of holding the bucket on various occasions. My uncle got to help out in this case.  Howlin' Wolf was intense. My uncle was about 6'3"" and although Howlin' Wolf's height is often described as 6'3"", my uncle swore he was taller, or that maybe it felt taller. He had huge hands too. But when he wasn't on stage, he was a pretty nice guy.  the Clancy Brothers name checked both my uncle and grandfather a few times and dedicated some songs to them during a handful of concerts when they'd come to town which made my grandfather go nuts. He was a fan.    All of these stories only really came to light while my uncle was dying of cancer a few years ago and I never really got to talk to him about it. Most of this was told to me by my father. I only really found out about all of this craziness after my uncle passed away. Kind of saddens me to think I never got the chance to talk to him about it.   A couple of years ago I posted scans of the 1966 Newport Folk Festival playbill magazine at http://m.imgur.com/a/E2LMu (reddit thread at http://www.reddit.com/r/folk/comments/z3km7/scans_of_the_program_booklet_for_the_1966_newport/). My great aunt and uncle are mentioned in the playbill, as is my uncle, although he was more of a roadie and never actually performed.   So that's at least part of my uncles Dylan story. I'm sure there's tons more to it, and apparently some pictures somewhere amongst his belongings and who knows what else. Rinzler did a lot of recordings and we have some tapes that he did, although it's mostly of local musicians. When I get a chance I'm going to hunt through the stuff to see if there's anything interesting -- who knows, I might unearth some previously unseen photos of Dylan or some other folkies of the era."

Anyway, he and his girlfriend left to leave, and he and Bob looked at each other, and they both just nodded. Bobby gave the guy a wry smile and that was it.   I'd do the same, I think."

Anyway, his music teacher (choir, band?) was a Mr. Zimmerman - Dylan's brother.  Dylan just came in to visit his class one day, talked a bit about what it's like to may a world-wide music icon and such, played a G chord or two, and left before lunch.  Another guy, a chaperon at my high school dance saw me wearing a Dylan tee-shirt, asked if me if I'd ever met him.  Stupid question.  But he had met Dylan right around the time he had converted to Christianity, and they discussed their mutual faith in Jesus and the power that comes from God's forgiveness.  I'm not a Christian -  but I bet Dylan could convert me.  Definitely a man I'd like to meet.  Nay - A man I'd like to hear simply talk."

Perhaps the language specifics you point out are merely used for imagery: switching to ""you"" to bring the listener closer in and empathize, a lone coyote certainly matches with the austere picture he's painted, and a cabin door banging on its hinges the same. I think in the end, it's a tough song about the hard life, poverty, isolation. It's cold and hopeless, but he's telling it like it is."
bobdylan,2kbmc9,monk_hughes,1 point,Sun Oct 26 00:50:55 2014 UTC,"That does seem pretty sensible. The coyote and cabin door banging on its hinges are great images in the song that do adhere to the mood of the song. That's probably just what they are, though: relevant and compelling imagery.  I'd have to agree that, no matter which interpretation (I'm fond of both, and think the one without the murder/mystery is probably right), the song is about how cold and hopeless life can be for those in poverty. It's depressing in that regard, but it's a part of reality that I think Dylan did a great job with inspiring empathy for.  Thanks for contributing!"
bobdylan,2kbmc9,Madmystic94,3,Sun Oct 26 06:35:20 2014 UTC,"I'll have to say as a Dylan fan, i have not heard that alternate interpretation that u speak of.

bobdylan,2kbmc9,Grizzlyhorse,1 point,Sun Oct 26 00:17:20 2014 UTC,"That's the story that seems the most popular, and I do agree with it because it is logical and fits. That said, I somehow missed it the first couple of times listening to this song (hence how I formed my interpretation). I could just be over analyzing it, thought, which is probably the case. Nevertheless, it's a bleak song that explores the horrors of poverty and what it drives people to do."

bobdylan,2kbmc9,IKnowItWasYouAlfredo,2,Sun Oct 26 00:22:33 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your support! The shift is interesting and I haven't been able to find a reliable reason for why Dylan decided to switch. I know that the ""you"" makes the listener closer to the story and inspires empathy, but I'm still not sure why Dylan would mention Hollis Brown at all if that was his intention all along. The only way that it could make complete sense is if Hollis Brown were an actual person, but I can't find anything that says he is."
bobdylan,2kbmc9,Awkward_Arab,2,Sun Oct 26 06:43:12 2014 UTC,"It's just a songwriting technique...He's introducing the story and the character as ""Hollis Brown"". He's bringing the listener into the story with ""you"". At the end it goes full circle and it's back outside of Hollis's point of view (cause he's dead). It forces the listener to empathize with Hollis's plight by turning the listener into Hollis. Dylan makes the listener kill his family, kill himself, then rise up above the situation reborn.  It's a good song, but there's no mystery in it."

His songs are recognizable, but he changes them at least every year to freshen them up and it's great. The new stuff is fantastic and lively.  But his voice does crack all over the place and its sometimes painful to hear. Up to the early 2000s he still had some control but no more. Whoever says otherwise is kind of in denial.   But the point is it doesn't matter. He's a legend who puts on a great and extremely relevant show that goes completely against the current fads and trends. If you haven't seen him, it's a must. A lot of people will be disappointed but those people didn't know what to expect, and apparently didn't like him enough to learn about the man and why he does what he does,   Find new shows on YouTube and you'll know what's up."

It is bad and looks like he is hurting while singing. Also he is having some trouble walking on stage for long time. But looks like he is still playing and liking it. Also yeah, He only sings new songs. He did Duquence Whistle and other songs from Tempest while in Hamburg last year. But that is Bob always exploring his horizon. Though in the end, with request for encore he sang Blowing in the wind but it was completely different than the original. And took me till the chorus to recognize the song. But I think it was worth it. To see the great man himself. It was fun for me.  I enjoyed all the songs.

His voice has changed and continues to change, but it's not ""gone,"" whatever that means.  I like a quote I heard once from a Rolling Stone writer, it was something to the effect that his voice only becomes more Bob Dylan-y over the years."

bobdylan,2k9cr8,strangerzero,-1,Mon Oct 27 17:49:36 2014 UTC,I prefer not to see Dylan in concert anymore because I don't like how he butchers his own songs. He is still writing and recording great songs though.

bobdylan,2k67jr,Mitchull,11,Fri Oct 24 17:52:17 2014 UTC,"The turning point in Dylan’s career was not just when he “went electric” (although one could write an entire Master’s thesis on the importance of this moment in modern musical history) it was when he discovered the poetry of The Symbolists.’  After this his lyrics changed dramatically from heavily Folk and Woody Guthrie influenced songs to true poetry.  Trying to distill the Symbolists into a short sentence or two is a tough task so I’ll quote from Wikipedia:  “The Symbolists believed that art should represent absolute truths that could only be described indirectly. Thus they wrote in a very metaphorical and suggestive manner, endowing particular images or objects with symbolic meaning.”  “Symbolists poems were attempts to evoke, rather than primarily to describe.”  “In a nutshell, ‘to depict not the thing but the effect it produces.’  One standout example of Dylan using the influence of The Symbolists in his lyrics is “Desolation Row.” The song is filled with real and fictional characters such as Cinderella, Bette Davis, Romeo, Ophelia, and Einstein disguised as Robin Hood.  When the lyrics are viewed with the knowledge that these figures are not just the literal person themselves but stand as symbols who evoke very specific emotional connections (emotional shorthand?) to each of us then one can see that Dylan is attempting to take the listener on a different kind of musical journey where the song is experienced on a deeper, personal, emotional journey.  Almost all other lyricists– both current and historically – use either the “Moon, Spoon, June” rhyming style or metaphor and simile, “Your love is like the wind, it’s here then gone.” Dylan goes for a singular style, influenced by poetry and The Symbolists that helps us connect to his songs in a completely different way.  In the documentary “No Direction Home” Joan Baez says (not sure I’m quoting with complete accuracy) “People either get Dylan or they don’t. Those that do get him get him deep.”  I’m of the opinion that those who do get Dylan deeply are the ones who are touched on a deeper, emotional level that connects with us on a deep subconscious, atavistic level. Even though they may not be able to fully express that fact.  Even further toward creating deeper connections, Dylan has very rarely expounded upon the meaning behind his lyrics. Rather he has given each of us the gift of allowing us to pour our own experience into his lyrics and have a singular, unique connection to each of his songs, thereby making each one somehow our own."

From the very beginning he never seemed to be in it for the money, but he's always been captivated by fame instead.  So few performers have a real message and they don't dig down deep like Dylan does - they are looking for a 'hit' instead of telling an important idea.  I've always appreciated his willingness to change drastically.  It's given me the courage to do the same."

And of course, his voice his more strained now than it previously was, but c'mon he is 73 years old and plays over a 100 shows a year!   Some of those vocals from the 1980s though - especially Shot of Love; Heart of Mine and Groom's Still Waiting At the Altar and Jokerman, especially the Letterman performance, are something else.  And of course, for the softly, crooning Bobby, we have Pretty Saro!"

If I were attempting a chronological walk-through, I'd do the live recordings mixed in with the studio stuff - all chronological (though listening to the entire '66 tour before moving on might be too much repetition)  You might also want to skip forward to some of his newer stuff since he's still touring - maybe you should see him live while you can  But to help you wade through all of the various bits and pieces:  Clinton Heylin's Bob Dylan: The Recording Sessions will help you integrate the bootleg and ""Official Bootleg"" studio tracks into the overall chronology (up until wherever it runs out...it won't help with Tell-Tale Signs much).  Heylin also has two volumes tackling the songs in approximate chronological order of composition (though that won't help you with cover songs or folk material).  He can be a pretty snarky writer, but he does his research.  Online you've got Olaf Bjorner's site: http://www.bjorner.com/bob.htm which features a pretty complete sessionography as well as a year-by-year assessment of what went on and interviews and all kinds of stuff  And there's bobsboots.com which will help you figure out what's on which bootleg and which are worth hearing (and which are duplicates, etc.).    bobdylan.com has lyrics to most songs and you can look them up by album  As to ""analysis"" besides the two Heylin books (and Griffin's book on the Basement Tapes if you want to get that focused) there's also Michael Gray's Song and Dance Man III (not part 3 but version 3, so no need to look for 1 & 2) which is extremely dense and very interesting."

My own approach was chronologically but not move on to the next album until you feel the particular album is under your skin and you know most of the lyrics. So you give each album at least some days or a week to sit with you, then move on to the next. I'd often backtrack and go back and listen to the past albums again after breaking in a new album and then sort of work up again to where I was...I listened to the bootleg series when they fit in the time line, so Witmark demos before and between the debut and Freewheelin, and the Royal Albert Hall after Blonde on Blonde etc Currently i'm on Self Portrait but have gone back and listened to John Wesley Harding and Nashville Skyline a great deal, next album to listen too is Another Self Portrait bootleg :)"

But for me, these added tracks, the incredibly improved sound - like someone else said previously, give some of the already taster released songs a listen; Don't ya tell Henry, Lo and Behold etc. and enjoy the superb quality - and of course, the thing that makes it a true revelation; this release is everything that is on Garth's reels, absolutely everything!"

bobdylan,2jv2m7,HazeandGrains,1 point,Tue Oct 21 21:12:24 2014 UTC,"80s Dylan albums are something I had to sneak up on when they weren't looking. That being said, Real Live is a fun listen. Straight ahead, well played rock n roll. Mick Taylor on guitar is super cool."
bobdylan,2jx1fy,poppinwheelies,1 point,Tue Oct 21 19:28:16 2014 UTC,"Well then I guess a vast majority of artists have alzheimer's. Few artists will radically change their setlist from night to night. Bob Dylan can do whatever the hell he wants and play whatever songs he wants - just like any other artist.  With all the rearrangements he does of his songs, he would be last person I would suspect of having Alzheimer's."
bobdylan,2jx1fy,HazeandGrains,1 point,Tue Oct 21 21:10:28 2014 UTC,The Alzheimer's part was a joke. It's just very unlike him to be playing the same set night after night after night. One of the reasons I've enjoyed his live shows so much was never knowing what to expect. I skipped out on his recent local (for me) shows for this very reason and I'm glad I did.

The buildup to the harmonica solo just sets it up so well, then the rush you hear from the crowd as he launches into that exuberant first flourish. You can tell he's really giving it all his passion. It's a simple melody, but damn does it ever sound triumphant.  Gives me chills every time."
bobdylan,2jslxk,LordShivaOfTehBhang,1 point,Tue Oct 21 07:19:18 2014 UTC,"The harmonica near the end of Percy's Song is, to me, the best. It's understated and is counterpoint to the guitar, but it triggers an emotional release after the story of the song reaches it's conclusion. It says what the lyrics leave out."

bobdylan,2jgmpz,BillyShears17,3,Fri Oct 17 01:51:03 2014 UTC,Lyrics. I'm in it for the lyrics.
bobdylan,2jgmpz,Edgar_Allan_Poo,3,Fri Oct 17 00:08:30 2014 UTC,"It depends on what kind of Dylan I'm listening to and how busy I am at the time. If I'm working hard, I'm more likely to listen to later Dylan or the bootlegs; if I am not so busy and can focus on the lyrics I usually listen to earlier Dylan. Yesterday at work, I listened to Modern Times, Blood on the Tracks, Desire, then started on Freewheelin' but stopped halfway through and finished it at home.   I love Blonde on Blonde more than most of his albums, but I don't even listen to it much because it's so beautifully dense and I don't often have the time to fully enjoy it."
bobdylan,2jgmpz,I_Fuck_Whales,1 point,Fri Oct 17 12:36:12 2014 UTC,"Blonde on blonde is my favorite. I only listen to it on special occasions  loud at night with glasses of wine, green fumes, and a pretty lady."

bobdylan,2jgmpz,unfitfuzzball,2,Fri Oct 17 00:50:08 2014 UTC,I'm neither good nor bad at remembering lyrics really but Dylan's lyrics seems harder than most artists to get into and remember for me for some reason :)
bobdylan,2jgmpz,kickstand,2,Sat Oct 18 19:44:58 2014 UTC,"Both. I love both in all of his albums/songs, most evidently that it's not just lyrics, but both, is when I listen to Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat, or Pledging My Time, or Absolutely Sweet Marie, I just lose it, it's not just the best lyrics that ever existed, it's the music that makes my blood flow faster, I immediately get into a great mood, and just wanna sing and dance along."
bobdylan,2jgmpz,jelly_head,3,Sat Oct 18 08:25:46 2014 UTC,"It's funny. A lot of people get into dylan because the lyrics are of a higher standard than a lot of what they're used to, and that's the big exciting change. The trade off, they feel, is that the music is somewhat boring, simple and his voice is divisive.   As you get deeper into the discography though, you find that the mix balances out, and the music and the lyrics compliment each other in brilliant ways. My favorite example is ""Idiot Wind"". The acoustic New York version doesn't carry the same rage and feeling as the album version."

I'm really excited to finally get to see him again, but I am slightly bummed that the place I'll be seeing him, (Keller auditorium in Portland) has no general admission, and is all seating. He was great in 2012, and I've really liked the look of his set lists in Australia."

I've seen him 12 times starting in '99.   Hey /r/dylanthegrey, 1.) I like your user name; and 2.) when was your first Dylan show? Was it underwhelming? And what made you curious to see more?   If you like hearing Dylan in his ""old age"" period, you might like this 2001 concert where he was still doing lots of guitar - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vugtvpqr0L8"

I've seen him on his summer tour with John mellencamp, then those two shows in 2012, the second of which was with mark knopfler. He played some guitar for the first show, but I don't think I've seen him play it since. My dad has been to about 10 shows, one of which was with Merle Haggard, and another was when Kings Of Leon were opening for him. Thanks for the link, I'll be sure to check it out! I've always been a Dylan fan, probably due to my dad being a fan also. I'm also named after him, haha. I didn't truly get into Dylan until about 10 years ago, and I doubt there's a day that's gone by since then where I haven't listened to him, it's really more of an addiction than an interest at this point."

bobdylan,2j9sm1,dukemantee,1 point,Wed Oct 15 16:04:21 2014 UTC,Saw him in Honolulu in April for my first time. Seeing him again this Saturday in Seattle. Hoping the setlist is unique from my last show. Pretty fortunate coincidence that I just moved to Seattle a month ago and he's starting his tour here.
bobdylan,2j9sm1,DundahMifflin,1 point,Thu Oct 16 03:28:17 2014 UTC,Have only seen Bob twice: on the tour with Tom Petty in '86 (I think) and at the Hollywood Palladium in maybe '95. Would love to see him at the Dolby here in LA next week but I'm going to be OOT.

My dad has been a Dylan since his Christian days, so he took all of us with him. Merle Haggard opened, I almost fell asleep, then Dylan finally took the stage.  I wish I cared about him more. I really didn't understand how big of a deal it was to see him play, but hey, that's what I get for being a stubborn teenager.   Now I just need to see him again. :("

bobdylan,2j9sm1,ThinWildMercury1,1 point,Sun Oct 19 06:51:56 2014 UTC,Wonderful as expected. I was really hoping he'd play an alternative setlist from the show I caught in Honolulu this April after hearing from this sub he changed it for some dates after. It happened to be the same.

I kind of have a theory that the reason he never remarried after his 2nd marriage was because his heart was still with her after all those years. If you read what he has to say about her in Chronicles, it's clear that he was thinking about her for a very long time after they parted. Not to mention how he grieved heavily after her death a few years back by making a rare public appearance at a synagogue with a grief-stricken face.  It's all speculation really, but I would like to think that he always wanted to stay with her."

Sometimes it's comforting to think we're being watched over or that there is a force that can help us overcome our troubles. If its ""out there"" or in ourselves, it's not much of a difference as long as we recognize the potenial for change."

And anyway, our teacher have us a C - we of course stood there broken, after out bloody hard work, and we asked her why we hadn't gotten an A, and she said that we'd copied it from Bob Dylan - we were about 14/15, we sort of knew of Bobby - knew he existed, knew about Blowin' in the Wind etc.   So we went back to my house after to search for this 'Bob Dylan' video that had screwed us out of our beloved A grade - cue black and white video, behind the Savoy; Subterranean Homesick Blues, my friends walked away after the first 10 seconds, I watched it repeatedly for about an hour trying to learn the words, and I haven't looked back!"

bobdylan,2ip776,RightWingersSuck,3,Thu Oct 9 03:25:15 2014 UTC,Unplugged. I used to subscribe to columbia house under false names. I was a 90's kid.  Own everything now (I bought it) and have seen Dylan 22 times.
bobdylan,2ip776,strangerzero,3,Wed Oct 8 22:33:47 2014 UTC,I had heard of Dylan vaguely in the 60s as a kid. First real exposure was on the Concert For Bangla Desh album. I loved Dylan's set. First album of his I owned was probably Blood on the Tracks.
bobdylan,2ip776,Awkward_Arab,3,Thu Oct 9 01:22:19 2014 UTC,I was 11 or 12 and I joined the columbia record club and picked a few double albums cause I thought they were a better deal. I got bob's greatest hits part II and the grateful dead's long strange trip.  Changed the entire course of my life.  I hadn't heard anything of bob's before then except versions of his songs by other bands and only knew he was like this legendary rock star. After getting it I became totally obsessed until I was 20 or so. I used to try and transcribe lyrics.
bobdylan,2ip776,jelly_head,3,Thu Oct 9 02:08:16 2014 UTC,'Twas in another lifetime... when I bought Blood on the Tracks in 1975. I was in high school. I had heard Shelter From The Storm and Idiot Wind on the radio and thought I got to get me some more of that. So I bicycled down to the Woolworth's and picked up the LP. New records cost about $4.49 then. I've been listening to that album ever since on every format they've come up with. It is still one of my favorite albums.
bobdylan,2ip776,jelly_head,3,Thu Oct 9 07:47:16 2014 UTC,"It was an assortment of songs at first, either late middle school or early high school. My first Dylan album that reeled me in was Blonde on Blonde, worked my way up, then down, then back up again. For all the changes in my life, the only constant thing was a good Bob Dylan track. My most vivid memories are often tied with songs that bleed into those moments, and listening to Dylan is like watching a reel of my memories unfold in my head. Atleast, when I'm in that nostalgic frame of mind, but mostly I just enjoy the music."

bobdylan,2ip776,Mitchull,1 point,Thu Oct 9 03:08:46 2014 UTC,Interesting that you didn't purchase Infidels. Was it more that you were intrigued by him and less by the song?
bobdylan,2ip776,I_Fuck_Whales,2,Thu Oct 9 03:19:17 2014 UTC,Perhaps that had something to do with it. But mostly I think it was that I was pretty young and living in a rural area. I didn't have access to the internet at that time and I seem to recall the local Target being very limited on their selection of Dylan albums!
bobdylan,2ip776,nvcradio,2,Thu Oct 9 16:02:52 2014 UTC,My brother told me at a young age that Dylan doesn't cover songs.  I had heard a lot and decided to go chronological. I thought for about 2 years that dylan wrote a lot of songs he did not.

About a year and a half ago, I started getting into other artists of the 60's, CSNY, Neil Young, Simon & Garfunkel and then decided to branch out a bit... I can't remember the first song I had heard of Dylan's but almost the day after I heard it, I download his entire discography... The album that first captivated me was Bringing it All Back Home and it still probably my favorite."

This one will be out of date as soon as Dylan releases a new album (probably in 2015). I wish it was possible to update the book or expand it with the arrival of new albums. Also does anybody know if this will include the lyrics from volume 11 of the bootleg series to be released in November??

bobdylan,2ii9hw,ddshroom,-7,Tue Oct 7 00:37:39 2014 UTC,Too bad it's a lip sync. It's rare for Dylan to do that sort of thing.
bobdylan,2ii9hw,Mrgreen428,3,Tue Oct 7 03:30:00 2014 UTC,This is definitely not a lip sync.
bobdylan,2ii9hw,I_Fuck_Whales,1 point,Tue Oct 7 13:24:57 2014 UTC,"Why I suspect something is afoot here:   No visible mics - at that distance it's pretty impossible to get that kind of distinct vocal coverage only with boom mics as well as to be able to effect the vocals with the kind of plate (it sounds like) reverb. There's nobody playing the accompanying arpeggiated acoustic part: they're both strumming. Most noticeable around 2:20. While the crowd is cheering in the very beginning you can hear Bob and Johnny saying something to each other that sounds like it was recorded at the beginning of the take but their mouths aren't moving. The second piece of dialogue sounds like ""Sounds good"" just before they begin. Everything about this performance sounds so much like an alternate take of the song on the album down to the type of reverb and mic setup.   I have my doubts as well - the performance seems really genuine and the laugh Johnny gives at the end stands out. Perhaps they're only playing with a track of some sort. As someone who works very frequently with mics and performers I can't imagine how they could record this without visible mics. Professional Lavaliers didn't really exist then and if they did they'd sound like shit and be the size of a tube of toothpaste."
bobdylan,2ii9hw,Mrgreen428,4,Tue Oct 7 14:14:36 2014 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_WsvGlQrt8 - that's the full episode of the show.  The Dylan section starts at 25 mins.  Joni Mitchell is on first, also with no visible mics, but Johnny is talking to her and they go straight into a duet (around 11 minutes in).  The first bit of dialogue when Bob comes in for the duet is ""Take a seat, Bob"" (with Johnny gesturing for him to sit down).  I think Bob then asks ""Was that alright to you?"", prompting the ""Sounds good"".  For the extra guitar part, it may be one of the band filling in a bit (still mic'd up from the first two songs)."
bobdylan,2ii9hw,tltn,4,Tue Oct 7 15:39:36 2014 UTC,Oh man. Watching the whole episode I can tell you're right now. I'd have sworn their vocals were running through a plate or something but I guess the room really does sound like that.  Edit: At least this one definitely is - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7FzXn7AZ38  Are people really downvoting me for admitting I'm wrong?
bobdylan,2ii9hw,Mrgreen428,1 point,Tue Oct 7 17:19:13 2014 UTC,"Also, at like 0:16 Johnny switches chords to the Bm too early, but you don't hear it."
bobdylan,2ii9hw,woweezowee34,1 point,Tue Oct 7 17:16:47 2014 UTC,"I have to disagree. A lot of the songs on the Johny Cash Show were sung without microphones. I see the lips moving for the part you talk about at part two. I'm pretty sure I hear Dylan, after they sat basically say he's going to sing the first verse, and you see his lips move. They're definitely not play syncing.   And I also just have to disagree on the fact that, I don't think I've ever heard Dylan play the same song twice in the exact same way with the same rhythm etc. Even if you listen to the unedited Freewheelin' tapes, he does a couple versions of a song that would eventually be ""I Shall Be Free."" I think there is one time the lyrics are the same and even if you account for the fact he's playing in a different key, you can clearly tell the difference. Also, the times when they sing, at least when Dylan sings, are often whenever he wants. It's not like a classic, measure and a half rest and then back to singing. You'll see him hold on to a verse a little longer sometimes. I just don't think that especially at this time, he would take the time to memorize that type of stuff. He freaked out when he was going to sing ""I Threw It All Away"" and they had like a fake tin roof shack built on the set he was going to sing in front of. I don't think he would tolerate lip syncing."
bobdylan,2ii9hw,v1s1onsofjohanna,1 point,Tue Oct 7 19:12:20 2014 UTC,"If you look I wrote a retraction on someone else's comment. Nothing is recorded ""without microphones"" - they're just further away from the singer(s) than I thought.  And Dylan has lip-synced but I guess that was confined to the 80s."
bobdylan,2ii9hw,Mrgreen428,1 point,Tue Oct 7 19:22:26 2014 UTC,What did he lip sync for? I'm not doubting you I'm just wondering.

There are almost no mics in the room though and certainly none on vocals or that gigantic compressed-reverb-sounding snare Sly Dunbar is playing.  Edit: 53rd not 58th"

bobdylan,2hn8l4,Edgar_Allan_Poo,1 point,Wed Oct 1 04:04:39 2014 UTC,"That's Bob Johnston. He was the replacement drummer for The Band when Levon split during the '66 European tour. He also produced Nashville Skyline, Self Portrait and officially was the producer on New Morning, but I think that was only because the Self Portrait sessions kind of fed into the New Morning ones. I think Al Kooper had pretty much taken over producing duties for the tracks that became New Morning.  I've always loved Bob Johnston. I don't really know why Dylan and him parted ways, at least in a work capacity. He seems like he has the same mentality and sensibility as Bob. He actually reminds me a lot of the producer for Shot of Love, I forgot his name. He'd let Bob do what he wanted with no preconceived notions of where anything was going, which is a very Dylan way of recording. But he would also push him. You can see an interview with him on the documentary ""Both Ends of the Rainbow"" which is on youtube. I'll try to find the part with that guy.  Edit: Found it  Seems like a very cool guy. I play guitar but don't really record or anything. If I were thrust into a studio, I would want someone like Bob Johnston or ChucK Plotkin in the booth."

bobdylan,2guo36,throe,1 point,Fri Sep 19 11:16:12 2014 UTC,"Thanks for posting this nice rendition and tribute to the gypsy Bob went to see, stayin' in a big hotel.  The King's first RCA record, first number 1 hit, first million-seller, HH was co-written in 1955 by Hoyt's mom Mae Boren Axton as a topical response to a Miami Herald newspaper account of a man who ended his own life, leaving a note that said ""I walk a lonely street"".    Back in the day, Bob and other early 60's Greenwich Village protest singer/songwriters often worked the same way, creating material after reading a newspaper story, like the one about a six-month sentence handed out strongly to the person who killed for no reason at a Baltimore hotel society gath’rin’, another lonesome death."
bobdylan,2guo36,readygoset,1 point,Fri Sep 19 19:14:16 2014 UTC,"Heartbreak Hotel:       ""Heartbreak Hotel"" is a song recorded by American rock and roll musician Elvis Presley. It was released as a single on January 27, 1956, Presley's first on his new record label RCA Victor.  It was written by Tommy Durden and Mae Boren Axton.  A newspaper article about the suicide of a lonely man who jumped from a hotel window inspired the lyrics. Axton presented the song to Presley in November 1955 at a country music convention in Nashville. Presley agreed to record it, and did so on January 10, 1956, in a session with his band, the Blue Moon Boys, the guitarist Chet Atkins, and the pianist Floyd Cramer. ""Heartbreak Hotel"" comprises an eight-bar blues progression, with heavy reverberation throughout the track, to imitate the character of Presley's Sun recordings.  The single topped Billboard's Top 100 chart for seven weeks, Cashbox's pop singles chart for six weeks, was number one on the Country and Western chart for seventeen weeks and reached number three on the R&B chart, becoming Presley's first million-seller, and one of the best-selling singles of 1956. It would eventually be certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Presley had first performed ""Heartbreak Hotel"" during a live show in December 1955 during a tour of the Louisiana Hayride, but the song gained strong popularity after his appearance on Stage Show in March 1956. It became a staple of Presley's repertoire in live appearances, last performed by him on May 29, 1977 at the Civic Center in Baltimore, Maryland.

bobdylan,2gpdm1,ModRod,4,Thu Sep 18 04:29:23 2014 UTC,"Really, what I've come to believe is that it was a defense mechanism. He did not want to be a media darling voice of a generation and frankly was not equipped for it.   I think he was rather insecure and used being an asshole to protect himself.  Joan Baez called it anticharisma."
bobdylan,2gpdm1,RightWingersSuck,1 point,Thu Sep 18 04:31:48 2014 UTC,"Exactly, we often ask so much of these people and get frustrated when they avoid interviews of play aloof at the fans but this whole media, fame machine is something we built around these people.  Not every famous person, not every celebrity wants to be one. It's a side-effect of the work, the nature of the industry. But us asking them to be okay with that, without debate, is extremely unfair. I mean, a lot of professional artists never wanted to be famous the way that we think.   Imagine how you would feel seemingly overnight, your entire world and your privacy are reduced to what you can make out of them. Suddenly, the entire world proclaims you shining star and saviour and you are just there singing your songs without any interest in the machine. Are you supposed to just let your dignity and your sense of privacy down just to play a part in this system that you never wanted to be a part of?   Everyone, when I have this debate, always answers, ""Well, you should have never become a rock star if you can't handle it, then!"" But it's no one's decision to become famous, that's not a thing you can decide to be. It's a product of the work. There are ways of handling and maybe Dylan might have been a little cold about it, but reading all thee interviews and things, no one really seems to have the right to ask such questions of Dylan. He strikes me as being annoyed at having to play the song-and-dance man routine for all these strangers he probably feels superior to in the first place."
bobdylan,2gpdm1,solarandlunar,2,Thu Sep 18 05:51:09 2014 UTC,I remember reading some late era rolling stone interviews (late era being anything since the 80's) and noticing a pattern.  The interview would ask a dozen questions and bob would give terse elusive answers. But when they asked a question he actually had a lot to say about. He would be lucid and an answer could be paragraphs long.   He was more than willing at that point to talk about stuff he cared about.   A light went on for me.

bobdylan,2gh7y3,Weis,2,Tue Sep 16 04:09:22 2014 UTC,"I like both of those songs, words and all. But the first is a about a girl gone, and swept away in her travels. Where she can't be blamed, what's not near is bound to grow less dear. He thought she was coming back, but the days grew longer and she traveled even further. That's why I love how the song flows, you can hear the heartbreak.   He's settling verse after verse, from wanting her to come the day before tomorrow, and not budging on his intent of seeing her again. But when he figured she was gone and not coming back, he went from kisses that rivaled diamonds to boots in hoping she might keep him in mind by getting something material.   The second is about a girl that stayed in a small town with the same faces. He's the one that's gone, she's a girl that's wrapped up in all he recalls about his roots, and that's the great thing about a love like that. It's not just the person whose pull is strong. It's about shared memories, hopes, and a sense of familiarity, that feeling of home.  That's how I see it."

Because of this a relate the lyrics so that Love Minus Zero is the beautiful beginnings of love and a relationship and It's All Over Now is the ugly break up.   Just my interpretation.

The best way is to let them remain on the web where tens of thousands of fans can listen to them and rate them.

bobdylan,2g3krw,willington123,4,Thu Sep 11 12:50:13 2014 UTC,"Hey guys,  So here's a bit of backstory for the photo, of the photograph!  I wrote a little bit in a post by u/Scrantonicity83 a couple of days ago about a couple of Bob Dylan related places that I've visited in London over the past couple of weeks.  I'm not sure if anyone else is really too interested, but I think it's pretty cool; Bob Dylan first left the US in the winter of 1962 aged 21, still a bit of 'complete unknown' at this point, he had only months earlier released his first album. He was asked to come over to the UK to star in a BBC play, The Madhouse on Castle Street.   He was spotted playing in NY by BBC producer Philip Saville who arranged with Albert Grossman for Bobby to come over and star in the play, playing the originally titled 'Bobby' character. The Madhouse on Castle Street was apparently something of a typical, boarding-house drama of the 60s - hell, I'm English and I have no idea what that is.    The Madhouse on Castle Street contained the first public performance of Blowin' In the Wind, as well as a traditional 'The Ballad of the Gliding Swan' - of course, the BBC junked the footage in 1967 and only extracts of the play and recordings exist. The BBC did a pretty great documentary on it a couple of years ago looking for people who may have recorded the play, I can post a link if anyone's interested. -   He came over to London in the middle to late part of December, and arrived into one of the coldest winters in British history - temperatures of around -20 apparently, believe me, we're really not used to that, and apparently the snow didn't thaw out until May '63.  During this time a young Bob Dylan became immersed in the British folk scene and played a number of gigs in the capital before and in between shooting of the play. Now I've been trying to do some investigating to try to find out which venue he played first, as there seems to be a little bit of confusion as a number of different places purport to be the place Bob first played outside of the US.  My fiancee and I recently had a weekend in London and she, knowing the fan I am, arranged for us to go for dinner at the Troubadour, which was also one of the places Bobby played during his short time in London; the place was awesome anyway, it has been there since the early 50s and was essentially an English version of the Gaslight, and other such New York coffee houses, it's got a dark interior and is honestly really cool, though there's nothing really in the way of Dylan memorabilia.   I then went down to London last week for a job interview, and with the afternoon to kill I decided to make a pilgrimage to the King and Queen Pub. Again so the K&Q is another place Bobby played, only this time they have a framed picture of him from 1962 hanging innocuously to the side of the bar.  The pub itself is lovely, it's only small but they do some damn nice beer - in fact 2 pints of EPA later and I could barely stand, and the folk club that fills the second floor is still very active which is possibly the best part. I spent the afternoon reading a book and taking in my surroundings and took a few pictures of the photograph itself.  Apologies as I've rambled, but I just thought it was pretty cool that a tiny pub in London has a great little piece of Bob Dylan history hanging right there. If anyone wants to ask anything I'm more than happy to answer."

bobdylan,2fuj12,RichHixson,10,Tue Sep 9 15:24:17 2014 UTC,Street Legal and Infidels are my two facorite unsung albums of his
bobdylan,2fuj12,BillyShears17,15,Tue Sep 9 01:53:09 2014 UTC,"Gun to my head, Street Legal is my favorite album. World Gone Wrong doesn't get enough love but Street Legal is so underrated it's upsetting.  In my mind, there are two kinds of Bob Dylan songs: one is ""personal songs"" (not songs that are very autobiographical but songs where he's really putting a part of himself on the tapes like Visions of Johanna or Dirge) the other is ""songwriter songs."" These are songs where he just says, ""I'm gonna write a song. It's gonna be a love song."" He's pretty much just flexing his singer-songwriter muscles. They're not any less important just more thought out. See any songs he was writing around Nashville Skyline or most of Desire.   Street Legal, in my opinion, has the perfect blend of these attitudes. If you look into his personal life around that time, it's fairly turbulent. Sara caught him cheating; he allegedly struck her in front of their kids which spiraled into a seperation. One of the players on the wiki article about the album really hammering the point hime is quoted talking about how he was chain smoking, always late, and overall in a bad mood. He also didn't have patience for studio engineers placing microphones correctly which is why, to some, the quality is a little lacking.  At the same time, with all these personal struggles, I feel that unlike the mid-sixties when he was eating and breathing music morning till night so any horrible feelings could be funneled into writing and playing, around this time, especially after all the Renaldo and Clara criticisms, music around this time was clocking in and clocking out for him- at least in terms of studio work.  That mixture I feel really evens out the album amazingly. On many songs that just seem like riffing like ""New Pony,"" the lyrics are just some standard blues bathroom stall writings, but he's spitting venom so much while he's singing you can practically hear it hitting the microphone.  The flipside of that coin: ""Changing of the Guards."" He's been quoted as saying that every time he sings that song it has a different meaning. Saying that about a song as obscure as it when compared with the rest of his catalogue implies there was a fairly direct purpose behind its writing. But while it's playing, you can almost sense that he doesn't want to be singing that moment. He's gotta have the whole band surround him in the mix and they're just feeding off his negative energy to really belt it out. And that feeds back into him thus creating one of the best Dylan tracks of all time cause he's been completely overtaken and won over by the music by the title verse which gives it so much velocity, he couldn't contain himself. It sounded like a religious epiphany in a song.  It's the perfect Bob Dylan album because like most things concerning the musical Bob Dylan, it puts a magnifying glass on its imperfections and owns them completely."
bobdylan,2fuj12,v1s1onsofjohanna,6,Tue Sep 9 07:31:38 2014 UTC,"Ah buddy, you're spot on! Dylan always took his imperfections and ran with them, and I guess I never really saw it that way. Street Legal is a phenomenal record. I love jamming to New Pony, the lyrics are eh, but fuck me if it's not a great song to turn all the way up. Or is your love in vain, which is a great listen too and even better to sing along to.  As for my ""best"" underrated Dylan album, which is not saying much, since it changes day to day. Currently it's john wesley harding, especially the title track, I like to listen to it on my way to work and think how great it would be to be some righteous gun toting cowboy. It just takes me back to being a kid and eating up stories about Buffalo Bill, and hell even that one sharpshooter, Anne Oakley. People that walked this earth, like you and me, but have just become lionized through time.   That's what I like about Dylan I guess, he's a myth of someone that still exists, you can only imagine the stories/folktales about him that'll follow his death, mine and yours too for that matter."
bobdylan,2fuj12,Awkward_Arab,2,Tue Sep 9 17:39:59 2014 UTC,"Hey thanks for that, gonna go and give Street Legal a serious listen. Think I'd just skimmed through it before, but the few tracks I know off it are great."
bobdylan,2fuj12,sydrduke,1 point,Tue Sep 9 12:45:26 2014 UTC,Ha. Yeah. The comment got away from me there. I could literally analyze every song on the album using that two song style template.

bobdylan,2fuj12,Tcmjdj,2,Wed Sep 10 22:23:11 2014 UTC,Agreed. Where Are You Tonight? is one of my all-time favorite Dylan songs and both of those albums are completely solid in my opinion.
bobdylan,2fuj12,jelly_head,1 point,Tue Sep 9 16:51:49 2014 UTC,I came here to add Street Legal. I recently bought that album on vinyl and it re-opened my eyes to how good it is.
bobdylan,2fuj12,fresh2deafbill,11,Wed Sep 10 23:21:00 2014 UTC,I feel that Love and Theft and Time out of Mind don't really get as much love as they should seeing as they are more recent and a lot of people only know his 60's and 70's work.
bobdylan,2fuj12,Plecboy,8,Mon Sep 8 22:08:15 2014 UTC,I think Time Out of Mind is Dylan's best
bobdylan,2fuj12,Gopnik_jaguar,5,Tue Sep 9 19:47:12 2014 UTC,Love and Theft is my all-time-favorite album.
bobdylan,2fuj12,poppinwheelies,8,Tue Sep 9 19:04:20 2014 UTC,PLANET WAVES
bobdylan,2fuj12,Fergus_CL,3,Tue Sep 9 04:18:02 2014 UTC,"I second Planet Waves - the musicianship alone of the recordings is mindblowing. I would say the trilogy of Planet Waves, Blood on the Tracks and Desire is amongst the best of any series of records for any artist. This fuck spit them out back to back.   I would also include Tempest in there. The fact that people don't give that record more credit amazes me. The production of that album is absolutely pristine. Everyone should listen to old Sun records and then listen to Tempest again."
bobdylan,2fuj12,solarandlunar,2,Tue Sep 9 05:09:00 2014 UTC,"This fuck spit them out back to back.    And they're very, very different from one another. It's just astounding."
bobdylan,2fuj12,Friedso,7,Tue Sep 9 14:20:58 2014 UTC,I'm extremely fond of New Morning. And I think Under the Red Sky gets a bad rep.
bobdylan,2fuj12,CaptainDread,9,Tue Sep 9 06:42:54 2014 UTC,IMO Bob never sounded more happy and carefree as he does on New Morning.

bobdylan,2fuj12,kingtao,4,Tue Sep 9 13:08:44 2014 UTC,"Hard Rain is maybe my favorite live recording of anyone of all time. The drive, passion, and almost punk attitude of both Dylan and the backing band are amazing."
bobdylan,2fuj12,RichHixson,6,Tue Sep 9 15:28:52 2014 UTC,"You're going to get wildly different definitions of underrated, but ""Planet Waves"" and ""Slow Train Coming"" are really good."
bobdylan,2fuj12,Friedso,6,Mon Sep 8 21:57:19 2014 UTC,I really enjoy Shot of Love
bobdylan,2fuj12,mike8902,4,Tue Sep 9 03:23:40 2014 UTC,"Street Legal is great, great stuff.  I also think that the closing song ""Where Are You Tonight"" does not get enough love.  It's an epic song that I feel is deeply personal.  The last verses are astounding."
bobdylan,2fuj12,PikeDeckard,3,Tue Sep 9 17:58:03 2014 UTC,"New Morning and Desire, I'd say, if we're talking pre-1980 stuff."
bobdylan,2fuj12,afb82,3,Mon Sep 8 23:39:17 2014 UTC,"Desire is highly critically acclaimed, and had one of Dylan's most popular song on it. Wouldn't say it's really underrated."
bobdylan,2fuj12,mcwilly,1 point,Tue Sep 9 01:48:36 2014 UTC,"I was thinking it gets comparatively little attention compared to its predecessor, Blood on the Tracks."
bobdylan,2fuj12,afb82,1 point,Tue Sep 9 02:06:25 2014 UTC,Yeah that's true. It's underrated in it's own way I guess.
bobdylan,2fuj12,mcwilly,3,Tue Sep 9 02:11:38 2014 UTC,"Plus, aside from ""Hurricane"" which is, rightly, one of Dylan's best-known songs, I feel like the rest of the songs don't get their due in the Dylan canon for some reason.  I, of course, know them all inside and out (as I'm sure many others here do), but I feel like Desire is an album that doesn't get recommended as much as BOTT might.  I guess I'd call it one of Dylan's lesser-known good albums."
bobdylan,2fuj12,afb82,3,Tue Sep 9 02:17:42 2014 UTC,Infidels always seems to be overlooked. It's one of my all-time favorite records. So good.
bobdylan,2fuj12,DundahMifflin,2,Thu Sep 11 04:32:15 2014 UTC,"Saved, Down in the Groove, Oh Mercy, Street Legal.  So many of his albums don't get the credit they deserve.  I call almost every other album his ""comeback"" album."
bobdylan,2fuj12,ObdwellaX,2,Tue Sep 9 04:51:19 2014 UTC,"Down in the Groove, John Wesley Harding and World Gone Wrong, if I had to pick a few. I also really like his 90s and 00s albums, which many people don't listen to."
bobdylan,2fuj12,fuuured,3,Tue Sep 9 15:31:21 2014 UTC,I always thought John Wesley Harding was one of his highest rated albums
bobdylan,2fuj12,ryyder,1 point,Tue Sep 9 16:10:22 2014 UTC,"Is it? From what I've read people consider it a disappointing comeback after the motorcycle accident, and it's also overshadowed by his previous 3 albums."

bobdylan,2fryil,AllHailHeisenberg,4,Mon Sep 8 06:17:30 2014 UTC,"I don't really have any anecdotal stories about Bob, not any I can think of right now, but I can expand a little bit about Bobby and his trip to London in 1962 in which he ended up playing at the Troubadour in London, as mentioned above.  He was asked to come over to perform in a BBC television play called 'Madhouse on Castle Street', which is pretty incredible really as he was only 21 years old and still relatively unknown after only releasing his first album so far.  He was spotted playing in New York by Philip Saville who was working for the BBC and producing the play, and Saville arranged for him to come over. It's crazy as the play container the first televised version of Blowin' in the Wind. By all accounts the winter of 1962 was pretty damn cold with temperatures reached as low as -22, which as English man sounds bloody cold.  During his time in London, he became immersed in the British folk scene; which is where he met Martin Carthy who's version of Scarborough Fair, Bobby adapted with Carthy's blessing and then proceeded to write Girl From the North Country.  Quite a few places in London purport to be the first place Bobby played outside of the US; the Troubadour of course, then there's the King and Queen pub near Mayfair and another place which I can't remember the name of!   My fiancée and I went down to London for the weekend last month for our anniversary, and she surprised me by taking me to the Troubadour as she knows I'm a huge fan of Bobby's and it was incredible; we stayed and had dinner, and it really doesn't seem like it's changed since the 60s; it's dark interior and makes me think that it was similar to the Gaslight and other coffee houses of the time.   Anyway, I'll stop rambling now, but I was down in London just this week and stopped into the King and Queen pub for a drink or two and took a couple of photos of the picture they have of when Bobby played there in 1962, so I can post it if anyone's interested.  Also if anyone wants to know any more about this particular time, I can answer some questions and things; apologies again for rambling but that's one of the hazards of being a History student and a massive fan of Bobby's!"

She told us that when Bob went to see Woody for the first time (nobody knew who he was), it was the daughter that answered the door, and she said go away. And Bob kept knocking, so this girl said he wasn't there. But eventually Arlo answered the door and let him in.   My teacher heard this from that Guthrie daughter, I heard it from her, and now you're hearing it from me, so I'm sure the details have been distorted. But still, cool story. If anyone ever gets the chance, ask Arlo about it."

bobdylan,2fdo3z,nostrilz,5,Mon Sep 8 23:29:26 2014 UTC,"Stopping drinking had a big impact on Bob's personality. That was the biggest change. Anyone who's fought addiction like that can attest to the changes you endure, alcohol is mask you can wear to hide your insecurities, when you stop drinking you're forced to confront yourself and redefine who you are socially. That happened to Bob, he was much quieter the first couple of years sober but then began to be much more social."

bobdylan,2fdo3z,nostrilz,3,Tue Sep 9 15:48:28 2014 UTC,You can pretty much find any show performed by Bob Dylan on SoundCloud or Youtube. It's pretty remarkable.
bobdylan,2fdo3z,JimsBeams,2,Tue Sep 9 20:46:03 2014 UTC,"But the question was about recordings ""by Bob Dylan's people"". I think it meant uncirculating recordings made by employees and archived.   Did your father ever mention that, rather than audience recordings by fans?"
bobdylan,2fdo3z,EdRicardo,9,Tue Sep 9 21:10:15 2014 UTC,"Ah, gotcha. Yes, Bob asked my father once to drive to universal. No specific reason given, Bob just said he needed some things picked up. When Victor got there, the employees at Universal started loading up my dads van with boxes. They didn't stop till it was completely full, only then did my father realize they were loading up ALL of Bob's masters. Everything he had ever recorded was headed from the vault at Universal to Bob's personal vault, for that brief 50 mile drive my dad's shitty blue van was the worlds most valuable shitty blue van. (it was short lived) The sound engineers also record the shows professionally, just incase there's ever a need for a recording. All those recordings just go into the vault, saved for no particular reason..."

The intro is good but tame and by the end they match his roar. He's got so much swagger it just doesn't matter that he's just making up new words left and right. One of my all time favorite Dylan vocal moments is when he leans into that 'I can hear that LONESOME WHISTLE BLOOOOWIN'' near the end. You hear how much fun he's having just destroying his vocal cords. Anyone who wonders what the hell happened to Dylan's voice over the years should start here. So good.

bobdylan,2eqo8w,iaminthecloset,3,Wed Aug 27 17:35:20 2014 UTC,"The last few I've gone to were around 50+15 in fees, but I'm sure it depends heavily on the type of venue and what the seating will be (general admission, middle ground, back row)"
bobdylan,2es2vl,Fitzelli,2,Thu Aug 28 00:58:58 2014 UTC,"Wow that's a big question, asking to sum up Dylan as a performer. I'm assuming you haven't seen him before, so here is what to expect:   The set list will be mostly recent songs; expect something similar to this The lyrics will be hard to understand unless you know them by heart The song arrangements will be very different from what is on the record version Bob will probably not play any guitar Bob will play some songs on keyboard/piano, and others just standing behind the microphone singing with his harmonica -- but always backed by his band. The real big hits will be saved for a song or two on the encore   It's not that he is not 'into' it... it's just that he is 73 years old now, which means he is physically incapable of performing like he used to.   He performs for his own pleasure. It is really nice to see. He treats his band like a ""bar band,"" not afraid to try this or that approach on any given night, and he doesn't care if you like the results or not.  The North American tour dates that were announced appear to be mostly ""theater"" venues, which is great for a first timer: good acoustics and seating for everyone. Give him a chance because he won't be around much longer.  Full disclosure: I've seen him 12 times since 1999. I thought the first show was underwhelming and unintelligible, but there was a no-frills, care-free attitude that made me curious to see more. It grows on you.  TIP: the closer to the front row you can sit, the more you will dig him. There is a natural charisma when you can clearly see his eyes."
bobdylan,2es2vl,glibrar,2,Thu Aug 28 02:37:33 2014 UTC,"His voice has been in good form recently, for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGK7t5084Tc or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KHpYJsl-Ko"
bobdylan,2es2vl,ThinWildMercury1,1 point,Thu Aug 28 16:08:20 2014 UTC,"Nice! He's always been able to sing as clearly as he wants, which is proven by the fact that he annunciates so much more on his records, even the later year ones. That's not just studio trickery. Hopefully he keeps this new live voice around for a while."
bobdylan,2es2vl,nostrilz,1 point,Thu Aug 28 17:02:09 2014 UTC,"Saw him last summer and he killed it on some songs, a little shaky on others. But I've heard that he's been in good form lately so ya never know what you're going to get when ya show up.   His set was pretty Tempest-heavy at that time so I'm hoping for more variety on this tour!"

It seems they changed their mind about BS11 being about ""Blood on the Tracks"" and want to get in on the momentum of ""Lost on the River"". Good for them.  Most importantly: an official release for ""I'm Not There (1956)"". What's next? A Christian Bootleg Series release?"
bobdylan,2em5zb,Friedso,2,Tue Aug 26 11:46:27 2014 UTC,Actually 'I'm Not There (1956)' was released on the soundtrack to the film which took its name.

bobdylan,2em5zb,litewo,2,Wed Aug 27 00:13:36 2014 UTC,"My guess is Shadows In The Night has been delayed, perhaps until 2015.   The supposed release date of August 26, 2014 has already passed.

I think it's about a guy and his mother who glorified being in the military and fighting for your country, but once both are exposed to the true essence and consequences of war it's too late.

But his piercing gaze is interesting to behold here. Shame it's most certainly heavily photoshopped though
bobdylan,2e9tt0,strangerzero,2,Fri Aug 22 21:14:19 2014 UTC,"I have this magazine. I love this cover, as well"

bobdylan,2e9tt0,CatMadeOfFur,1 point,Fri Aug 22 22:57:19 2014 UTC,Good as I need to you album cover
bobdylan,2e9tt0,BillyShears17,1 point,Sat Aug 23 05:16:53 2014 UTC,"This one. I don't know why, I guess it's just that he looks really cool in it."
bobdylan,2e8usx,PikeDeckard,7,Fri Aug 22 03:32:58 2014 UTC,"Open tuning on ""buckets of rain."" ""don't think twice"" is amazing. I like the riff, simple but fun, on ""I don't believe you (she acts like we never have met)"""
bobdylan,2e8usx,TobyCelery,8,Fri Aug 22 03:57:38 2014 UTC,Don't think twice is some impressive playing.
bobdylan,2e8usx,dark_side_of_steven,7,Fri Aug 22 08:20:39 2014 UTC,"I really like the stuff on World Gone Wrong, the riffs from It's Alright Ma, A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall and House Carpenter. This is just off the top of my head, I'm sure there are more."
bobdylan,2e8usx,fuuured,4,Fri Aug 22 04:05:59 2014 UTC,I love Delia and Blood in my Eyes especially
bobdylan,2e8usx,Grizzlyhorse,2,Fri Aug 22 04:26:16 2014 UTC,"Agreed I really love the intimacy of his guitar work on the WGW/GAIBTY albums.   Also Slow Train comes to mind, there are some tasty licks on that track."

bobdylan,2e8usx,london_callingDylan,1 point,Fri Aug 22 23:13:11 2014 UTC,"There actually was this live electric performance of ""Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest"" in the 80s where Dylan pulled an impressive and smooth guitar solo on. People never comment on his guitar-playing, but that was one of those rare moments when precisely that caught the audience's attention."
bobdylan,2e8usx,ZeeDDD65,1 point,Sun Aug 24 15:32:40 2014 UTC,"Of course Dylan doesn't shred but his picking style is beautiful. He has some serious rhythm as well.   I particularly like Don't Think Twice,I was young When I Left Home and It's Alright Ma"
bobdylan,2e7mth,62Silvertone,5,Thu Aug 21 20:09:16 2014 UTC,I protest the banner. It doesn't represent Bobs full scope.
bobdylan,2e7mth,62Silvertone,3,Fri Aug 22 00:31:35 2014 UTC,"I agree, you're absolutely right! I think we should use one picture for each Dylan incarnation, meaning less '64-'66 and more 70's, 80's and 90's. But I just wanted to get changes going as fast as possible.  Thank you for your feedback, 62Silvertone!"
bobdylan,2e7mth,CatMadeOfFur,2,Fri Aug 22 04:50:40 2014 UTC,It feels good to be heard. Current bob is my favorite bob.

bobdylan,2e7mth,CatMadeOfFur,4,Thu Aug 21 23:16:43 2014 UTC,You have no idea how much your comment means to me. Thank you!
bobdylan,2e3by3,SympatheticDevil,13,Wed Aug 20 16:14:36 2014 UTC,"Since the new mod said he was looking to bring some changes to our beloved niche sub, I thought I'd try my hand at helping and made a banner! The pictures are arranged in chronological order so the banner is also a small timeline from the early 60's to present day.  If the mods do decide they want to use it I saved the .psd so I can make any requested changes. If they decide they don't want to use it that's cool too.  Bonus: Potential new Bobby Alien STHSB style! Before anybody calls me out, yes, I am painfully aware of how bad I am at doing hair.  EDIT: Wow, my first ever gold! Massive thanks to /u/ThePeculiarPenguin for being such a generous redditor! I have a feeling he's going to be a great mod."
bobdylan,2e3by3,Pope_of_Eruke,5,Wed Aug 20 16:20:39 2014 UTC,"Nicely done. Maybe a little heavy on one era (5 of the 7 pictures are from a 3-4 year period). I'd like to see a picture from the eighties, plus a current day picture."
bobdylan,2e3by3,62Silvertone,1 point,Wed Aug 20 17:42:47 2014 UTC,I want to see some current bob in there! Maybe a chronological bob banner.
bobdylan,2e3by3,maehren,12,Wed Aug 20 17:28:38 2014 UTC,"Here's my suggestion:  http://i.imgur.com/dbWVm9J.jpg  A little bit more simple. But I like how the pictures seem to be different people interacting with each other. ""Woody Dylan"", ""60s Dylan"", and ""Old Dylan"" just seem like totally different people to me, so I think it fits well."
bobdylan,2e3by3,Mr_Spam_Man,4,Wed Aug 20 18:25:08 2014 UTC,"This looks great. You're right, it really captures one of the things I love most about Dylan's work: how much he's changed over the years."
bobdylan,2e3by3,ThePeculiarPenguin,3,Wed Aug 20 18:39:07 2014 UTC,"Wow, that one is great too! Very elegant! Perhaps we could switch it up once in a while and use different banners?"

bobdylan,2e3by3,BillyShears17,2,Thu Aug 21 18:39:38 2014 UTC,"Looks good to me, I'd only suggest trying out a different typeface on the /r/bobdylan part, for example something with a typewriter-style font set."
bobdylan,2e3by3,nostrilz,1 point,Wed Aug 20 18:12:47 2014 UTC,"Could the header just be his picture on the front cover of ""Good As I Been To You""?"
bobdylan,2e3by3,BillyShears17,1 point,Wed Aug 20 19:54:07 2014 UTC,"I like the album, but that always seemed like a ""phoned in"" album cover to me. Maybe I'm missing something though. What do you see in it?"
bobdylan,2e3by3,nostrilz,2,Thu Aug 21 14:41:50 2014 UTC,"Idk. I just always found the picture intresting. Hes probably thinking ""Im gonna wait 7 years before I win a Grammy"""

bobdylan,2e02rf,breakdown95,3,Tue Aug 19 17:40:58 2014 UTC,That's fantastic! I can't wait to hear the rest.
bobdylan,2e02rf,thebichedder,3,Tue Aug 19 22:36:35 2014 UTC,Cool! Here's some more information for people who aren't really up to date and didn't really know what this video was (like me!): http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/hear-bob-dylans-new-basement-tapes-cut-nothing-to-it-sung-by-jim-james-20140819
bobdylan,2e02rf,kakature,3,Wed Aug 20 12:26:00 2014 UTC,"I'm liking this, the music is absolutely solid. If the album holds up to this song's production value, I'd think T Bone did a top notch job. I'm glad they didn't try to copy late 60's Dylan, but use his words as a springboard to do their own thing. Which in a funny way, their own thing, really reminds me of The Beatles, maybe it's Jim's vocals?"
bobdylan,2e02rf,Awkward_Arab,2,Thu Aug 21 19:01:06 2014 UTC,I was skeptical but this track is growing on me. Reminds of a John Lennon tune. I'm intrigued to hear the rest of the album for sure.
bobdylan,2e02rf,jelly_head,1 point,Wed Aug 20 18:22:29 2014 UTC,"Pretty good song, I'm definitely looking forward to hearing more. The lyrics are interesting, because I wouldn't have placed them in the basement tapes era if I had just read them."
bobdylan,2dv8wx,fuuured,10,Mon Aug 18 07:38:11 2014 UTC,"Flairs would be pretty cool. I'm thinking different icons representing Dylan's eras. So it'd be folk Dylan from the early 60s, electric Dylan mid 60s, folk Dylan again in the late 60s and so on. It might be a bit hard to do though.   Album covers might work as flairs too. It would also be easier to do."
bobdylan,2dv8wx,CatMadeOfFur,3,Mon Aug 18 15:38:00 2014 UTC,"What about iffrent things that make dylan, dylan? mouthharp, raybands, a chicken, light bulb, etc."

bobdylan,2dv8wx,ThinWildMercury1,2,Tue Aug 19 19:40:12 2014 UTC,That is a superb idea! I'll start working on it right away!

bobdylan,2dv8wx,fuuured,2,Mon Aug 18 14:53:39 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the warm welcoming and great feedback, Tigris! You can expect visual changes within a week."
bobdylan,2dv8wx,fuuured,5,Mon Aug 18 18:10:08 2014 UTC,The side description needs changing.  A while back there was a thread asking for suggestions and I think the top voted comment was pretty good- see here
