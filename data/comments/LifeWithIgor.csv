You get to chat up more neighbors (otherwise if you stay in the back the old, rotund, shirtless dood next door will chew your ear off about how the neighborhood is going in the terlit). You can keep an eye on the neighborhood kids. Those dang kids. Comes in handy with their parents let them climb in the back of a stangers pick-em-up truck and use it as a trampoline. These kids were most likely the reason said neighborhood was terlit bound."

And all of these men were pope before the beginning of the 3rd century AD.   However, if he converts to Anglicanism he has a chance. The Roman Catholic church has accepted some married Anglican Priests as Priests. And they get to stay married and have sex with their wives. (No openly gay and sexually active priests are allowed in or out of wedlock in the Roman Catholic church.)"

LifeWithIgor,34qkcu,KinderSpirit,3,Mon May 4 00:21:11 2015 UTC,"That is how I always hear it. A man is married and becomes a priest. Everything is good.

LifeWithIgor,34qkcu,saricher,2,Mon May 4 01:48:18 2015 UTC,"The Catholic Church is made up of different rites, the largest being the Latin rite that you most often see.  In the Latin rite, priests remain celibate and take that vow at their ordination, UNLESS a married Anglican priest and his family converts - his ordination can be recognized and he can be a priest in the Latin rite.  However, in some of the Eastern rites - Maronite, or Melkite - married men can become priests.  In both, a priest cannot marry, meaning he cannot be ordained a priest first and then go looking in his congregation for a wife.  Also, permanent deacons in the Catholic Church must be married men (and their wives must agree to them becoming deacons)."

In fact, in none of the various apostolic faiths can a man become bishop while married (Orthodox, Catholic, Oriental). Since the Pope is by definition the Bishop of Rome, that rules Igor out regardless of any other hoops he jumps through (conversion, ordination to the priesthood, etc). If he become's widowed, things might change, but I wish a long and healthy life to your sister, so that seriously dampens any possibility of Igor becoming pope."

I'm not a big fan on allowing animals sleep in the same bed as me, so we made the dog sleep on the floor.  I had gotten up to use the bathroom at some point during the night, and sure enough I get back and see the dog is curled up face buried in my pillow. I try to tell the dog to get down and she then tries to push my then girlfriend off the bed so she could sleep next to me.  I had to leave the next day to travel, and sure enough I get a text saying the dog had taken my worn undershirt to her bed and was sleeping resting her head on it.   I've never owned a dog, so I've never experienced something like that before. After seeing the connection that dog felt towards me I have no doubt that a trained therapy dog can do magic.

Thank you for your sensible comment. I think the ONLY reason some people overcook bacon is due to their irrational fear of undercooked pork; trichinosis to be specific. But there hasn't been a single case of trichinosis in the U.S. in decades (I may be slightly overstating this but basically it's nothing we need to worry about). Floppy bacon is good bacon. Safe bacon. Crispy crumbly bacon is awful. A pig died in vain."

LifeWithIgor,33wz0c,littledinobug12,4,Sun Apr 26 14:19:11 2015 UTC,"I mostly meant because I rarely get to eat with someone who can share the struggles. Especially the raw veggie thing, I basically don't have any veggies I like cooked (peas, corn, greenbeans, and aside from corn I'll eat those all raw too), so it's a pain in the ass to find meals when eating out that aren't ""fried food with fries on the side""."

Never a garden salad.  Of course the fact that he's got these issues makes it kind of a boon when he goes to work on his aircraft (He's in the Canadian Military and is flight crew) so he gets the boxed lunch, sometimes he doesn't want what's in it so he just brings it home, devours anything he comes across in the form of ramen or hamburger and rice, and let's the kids pick at his lunch from the day.    Unfortunately flight feeding has stopped catering to allergies so now if there's a lobster roll or a crab sandwich he will have to throw it out because my son is also deathly allergic to seafood.  (Can eat tuna and salmon at least.)"

As a kid, this drove my mother insane, because she said I was wasting food.

I like a small splash in pho and in mayo -- but I don't understand why I can't embrace it.  Hell, I love every kind of condiment there is -- hence my username -- but I buy Siracha and say I'll try it again and get used to it until the time I can say ""I want it on everything.""

LifeWithIgor,337yfa,girl_of_bat,38,Tue Apr 21 02:38:37 2015 UTC,You're in trouble now /u/DisgruntledPlebian Now we need both Igor AND bunny updates.  Except if they die - don't ever tell us if they die
LifeWithIgor,337yfa,Betsy514,9,Mon Apr 20 22:14:56 2015 UTC,"Well, I just checked on them this morning. We had a pretty bad thunderstorm roll through last night, lots and lots of pounding rain.  The babies were all dry, warm and pink. The tarp above them had a huge pool of water on it that was actually pushing down on the babies.  I'd be willing to bet money that if Igor hadn't put up that tarp....  Well, I'm not allowed to talk about that, so I don't have to."

LifeWithIgor,337yfa,str8pipelambo,23,Tue Apr 21 13:01:24 2015 UTC,We have a nest of rabbits too...we're afraid to move it in case the mom can't find them afterwards. Is that ridiculous?
LifeWithIgor,337yfa,LittleTillyFooFoo,44,Mon Apr 20 12:35:12 2015 UTC,We read online that you can move the nest up to 10 feet away and the mama should be able to find them again. Mama bunnies are only at the nest for maybe 5 minutes morning and night so you have to check the babies and make sure they're still pink and warm a day after you move them
LifeWithIgor,337yfa,Trekkie_23,15,Mon Apr 20 13:10:43 2015 UTC,"Ok cool cuz by the time we saw the bunnies they were furry and I think have left already. O well, two weeks of watching my dogs like a hawk out in the yard weren't a total waste."
LifeWithIgor,337yfa,saintcazorla,6,Mon Apr 20 13:37:55 2015 UTC,Why did you have to move them?
LifeWithIgor,337yfa,SetFireToTheRane,26,Mon Apr 20 14:19:28 2015 UTC,"They were in our garden, and between the soil tilling, watering, and planting, we didn't think it was the best place to have bunnies.   We moved them about 3 feet away (you can see the half-fenced in garden plot in the picture and although the tarp hides them, they are up against some rocks, and we've got extra chicken wire to hopefully continue to protect them."
LifeWithIgor,337yfa,ceejiesqueejie,23,Mon Apr 20 14:24:52 2015 UTC,"I love this!   A few years ago, my parents wouldn't tell me if they found a rabbit's nest because I was pregnant at the time and baby bunnies didn't always make it (we lived in the country). I finally convinced my dad to show me after it had just rained through the weekend.. Their burrow had filled with water and they all drowned. :-( it had never crossed our minds to think of them in the rain. I won't ever forget it, but now we look out for them if we find them."

LifeWithIgor,337yfa,darksorceressmonoke,4,Tue Apr 21 01:08:07 2015 UTC,Urine does kill grass. That's why it's not uncommon for people with dogs to have yellow/dead spots in their yard.

LifeWithIgor,335jmf,Astronaut_Sasquatch,12,Mon Apr 20 01:22:11 2015 UTC,Are these products Igor approved?  More importantly would they be safe for a 5 year-old to use (she's just hitting the playing with make-up stage)?
LifeWithIgor,335jmf,xDangeRxDavEx,19,Mon Apr 20 00:45:59 2015 UTC,"I see no reason why they wouldn't, although younger children tend to have more sensitive skin, so I would definitely do a spot test with any new product. I've tried my absolute best to provide products that have less of the 'nasty stuff' that mass produced products have. I've actually got a 'kid line' in the back of my head featuring fun scents and products (i.e. bath bombs with little plastic toys inside, bubble baths, etc) which will hopefully make an appearance as I hammer out the details. I've got a 15-month-old nephew/guinea pig and I wouldn't sell anything marketed to young kids that I wouldn't trust myself to use on him.  All that being said, if you do decide to try them, make sure she knows the sugar scrub is NOT for eating!  And Igor likes them, or at least he feeds my ego and says he does. Though he said the sugar scrub needed to be rougher. Like, peeling his skin rougher."

LifeWithIgor,31ay12,usmc50cal,2,Sat Apr 4 01:25:59 2015 UTC,Igor! Is it truly you?! There could not possibly be any goal loftier.  And I live in the Pacific Northwest :)   Edit: a word
LifeWithIgor,31ay12,fuck__this,2,Wed Apr 8 20:08:54 2015 UTC,Ah I see I live in the Atlantic northeast! But if I make it out west I will keep you informed.
LifeWithIgor,31ay12,usmc50cal,2,Wed Apr 8 20:21:04 2015 UTC,I really like this Igor. :)
LifeWithIgor,31ay12,Cobaltsaber,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:38:37 2015 UTC,Goggles with lights on them were an important plot point in one of the Doctor Who novels ... not sure of the name but it has Rory and Amy.  Perhaps Igor escaped from the world of fiction.

LifeWithIgor,316i97,Drawtaru,42,Thu Apr 2 17:13:42 2015 UTC,Is he using a dremel?
LifeWithIgor,316i97,dinosquirrel,69,Thu Apr 2 12:01:46 2015 UTC,"Yup! The sandpapery head grinds the nail down to a much smoother end than normal nail clippers. The result is no sharp scratchy just-cut doggie nails. I've found you're also far less likely to hit the quick, since you're grinding the nail down slowly and smoothly rather than just cutting it.  The dogs aren't big fans of nail time regardless, but they are all used to the dremel. Allie usually does the corgis nails, though, so Marvin is putting on a super melodramatic show."
LifeWithIgor,316i97,Difren,16,Thu Apr 2 12:34:03 2015 UTC,"That's cool, thanks.  My Great Dane loved having his nails clipped by my dad.  He'd just keep trying to give you his paw, even tho dad wasn't done with the other foot yet!"
LifeWithIgor,316i97,digitalyss,9,Thu Apr 2 12:39:17 2015 UTC,"My dog loves getting her nails dremeled.  I say ""Come get your nails did!"" and she comes and sits in my lap and usually falls asleep while I work."
LifeWithIgor,316i97,bindsaybindsay,-29,Thu Apr 2 18:51:57 2015 UTC,"Please don't use a Dremel. The head speed is high and heats up what it's grinding, VERY quickly, including dog nails and can be painful. Pedi Paws is the same device but much slower with a nail guide. I understand he's being Igor, but this isn't the best for the dog.   Pedipaws is about 5krpm and I could totally be wrong here, but in my experience with grinding, I'd be careful."
LifeWithIgor,316i97,willkinton247,22,Thu Apr 2 13:14:35 2015 UTC,"Most dremel tools (At least every single one I've seen) are multi-speed. Besides, you're not supposed to go at a nail constantly with any grinding tool. Grind. Wait. Grind. Wait. Gives the nail and the tool head time to cool off."
LifeWithIgor,316i97,cheesecake-gnome,16,Thu Apr 2 13:39:39 2015 UTC,Veterinarians use Dremels.
LifeWithIgor,316i97,boobsmcgraw,10,Thu Apr 2 16:53:18 2015 UTC,Pedipaws doesn't get the job done and the guard just makes it difficult to use. If your smart about how you use the dremel you'll be fine. Just don't hold it on one toe for too long and keep it moving around.
LifeWithIgor,316i97,cheesecake-gnome,-2,Thu Apr 2 15:58:11 2015 UTC,That's a brilliant idea.

LifeWithIgor,316i97,boobsmcgraw,3,Thu Apr 2 12:19:21 2015 UTC,"My bf uses it on our frenchie, hee freaks out a lot less than with regular clippers. It also lessens the chance of us going below the quick."
LifeWithIgor,316i97,iamajellybear,3,Thu Apr 2 12:38:36 2015 UTC,Yep. I'm a groomer and use them on the daily. They're pretty neat but they get nail dust everywhere.  Every.   Where.
LifeWithIgor,316i97,boobsmcgraw,2,Thu Apr 2 16:20:11 2015 UTC,it's very normal! we do it at the vets office I work out. makes the nails smoother than when you do it with clippers and some dogs freak out less.
LifeWithIgor,316i97,whiskey84,1 point,Thu Apr 2 15:05:03 2015 UTC,I would have thought the noise and vibration would freak them out more.  The more you know!
LifeWithIgor,316i97,kingeryck,1 point,Thu Apr 2 23:25:26 2015 UTC,"it really depends on the animal! for some of them the loud sudden sound of clippers is worse, whereas with the dremel you can let them get used to the sound for a minute before you put it near them."
LifeWithIgor,316i97,Artrobull,2,Fri Apr 3 05:05:36 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense
LifeWithIgor,316i97,AlyssaXIII,1 point,Fri Apr 3 07:13:54 2015 UTC,"It freaks our dog out a little less, but only when we use the extent ed handle thing that has the motor a little further from her. And you wind up with very smooth nails."

LifeWithIgor,30wv4f,Smogshaik,19,Tue Mar 31 12:23:39 2015 UTC,"That's weird, because they genuinely were edits as well. They were right after I posted them though, if that would make any sort of difference.   Edit: just seeing if it shows up as edited"
LifeWithIgor,30wv4f,badamang,24,Tue Mar 31 12:33:20 2015 UTC,It only comes up as *edited * if you do it more than 10 minutes after posting (or some similar amount of time). That way you can fix the obvious glaring grammatical errors that inevitably slip past the proofreading process without people calling you on editing shenanigans.

LifeWithIgor,30wv4f,jicuken,13,Tue Mar 31 15:08:29 2015 UTC,English has a tendency to mug other languages and steal their words. Kielbasa is also the English name of that particular sausage.

I think my morning bitchiness amused her.)   She walked up to the counter and ordered twenty. Why twenty? ""Because I'm adult with his credit card. I show him."" She then laughed maniacally the whole way home while periodically shoving her face in one of the bags to smell them.   She didn't let my brother have a McGriddle from her stash."
