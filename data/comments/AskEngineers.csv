AskEngineers,3e4bmi,imnormallosers,20,Tue Jul 21 21:17:20 2015 UTC,"One of the more important traffic considerations is that there are likely different vertical and horizontal road curve requirements in each direction at the point of crossing. This is especially important for highways, and why the two directions of a freeway are infrequently perfectly parallel for anything but straight sections. Sometimes it's more economical to cut in the mountain a bit and build one bridge, sometimes it's the cut/fill that's more prohibitive.  It's uncommon, but sometimes, when increasing road capacity, an old two-way bridge is repurposed into a single-direction bridge and a new one is built beside it. Those are usually pretty obvious cases."
AskEngineers,3e4bmi,SkyNTP,12,Tue Jul 21 22:12:48 2015 UTC,"One of the big considerations in doing freeway work is not completely destroying the traffic flow for however long it takes to build the new road.  Because of this the projects are built in phases to keep people moving during construction.  If an overpass needs replacing either with a wider structure to increase capacity of the overpass or a longer structure to increase capacity of the freeway, you can build the new next to the old.  Then when that is done, reroute traffic to the new structure, demo the old and build an identical one next to it.  Then just re-stripe into the final configuration.  This is also why you might notice a horizontal shift right before a bridge starts."
AskEngineers,3e4bmi,NordicNightmare,5,Wed Jul 22 00:16:52 2015 UTC,This is the main answer. Still allows traffic movement while allowing construction on the adjacent structure to be built.
AskEngineers,3e4bmi,Acorogia,5,Wed Jul 22 00:48:01 2015 UTC,It's the fastest way to increase capacity without significant downtime.
AskEngineers,3e4bmi,AGlassOfMilk,4,Tue Jul 21 22:52:41 2015 UTC,"Your point about failures is an important one, and I think construction staging is another. The impact on traffic flow (although it will obviously be slowed down significantly) from redirecting all traffic to  one bridge while demolishing and reconstructing the other and then repeating the process is much less than that of closing off the road completely for half the time."
AskEngineers,3e4bmi,lurkerish,2,Wed Jul 22 00:15:49 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what happened/is happening with the Inner Belt Bridge in Cleveland.  I-90 cuts right through downtown Cleveland, and a massive nearly mile long bridge carries it over the Cuyahoga River.  For its rebuilding, the traffic was diverted to the northbound side and the southbound bridge was torn down and replaced.  Then traffic was diverted to the new bridge and the northbound bridge was torn down, and is in the process of being replaced.     By doing this, I-90 stays open throughout the entire project.  Diverting all the traffic to I-490 and then I-77 for a couple of years would be phenomenally disruptive."
AskEngineers,3e4bmi,brickfrenzy,-1,Wed Jul 22 02:46:50 2015 UTC,"In some cases the two bridges were built at different times but in similar styles to maintain symmetry and aesthetics.  Originally there may have been a two or four lane bridge on the site, but when that proved insufficient to manage traffic a second bridge was constructed next to it.  Then traffic is routed across the two bridges in obvious fashion."

AskEngineers,3e28f2,Couchtiger23,86,Tue Jul 21 19:37:23 2015 UTC,"Your tires are responsible for working with your suspension to dampen and minimize bumps on the road.

AskEngineers,3e28f2,obsa,8,Tue Jul 21 16:18:41 2015 UTC,With the higher mass the wheel doesn't transmit high frequency vibrations not the body instead absorbing it into deforming the tire (and heat). This smooths out the ride some.
AskEngineers,3e28f2,smpstech,2,Tue Jul 21 16:22:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, sure, but that would only work if the tire was perfectly filled with fluid under load, so somewhere right around 14psi to match atmospheric pressure. Problem is, you'll never be able to maintain that as the suspension jounces. As the tire deforms, the water will be pressurized, likely transmitting vibration better, not absorbing it. I am doubtful that the ride quality would be improved."
AskEngineers,3e28f2,Nf1nk,2,Tue Jul 21 20:00:27 2015 UTC,But the tire can't deform as it is filled with an incompressible fluid.
AskEngineers,3e28f2,pm_me_your_rockets,6,Tue Jul 21 17:15:05 2015 UTC,Tires are more stretchable than you might hope. Something is going to give and the rubber is first in line. The steel belts are remarkable but the variety of tire failure modes is good reading.   Probably also blow off the bead.
AskEngineers,3e28f2,Fearlessleader85,2,Tue Jul 21 17:20:33 2015 UTC,Rubber is stretchy bruh. Your right that when the tire is full of air the air just compresses. A water tire would have it the tire compress locally and expand around the rest of the rim.
AskEngineers,3e28f2,Nf1nk,6,Tue Jul 21 22:43:37 2015 UTC,"The tractor tires aren't filled completely with water. Usually just half. If you did just water, it would make the car ride much stiffer as the tires would have virtually no give."

AskEngineers,3e28f2,Moull1968,16,Tue Jul 21 20:55:10 2015 UTC,"Your tires would be much much heavier. This means your engine has to do more work to move the tires the same amount.

I'm expecting to see the frequency content because I'm looking for a heterodyne. The light I'm capturing on my photo detector is coming from two intersecting beams being scattered.

The higher frequency content I'm expecting to see is the beat frequency from the two beams being scattered with some Doppler shift.
AskEngineers,3e2pa5,LeaveittoTIM,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:32 2015 UTC,"Yea you won't see your 1 MHz signal unless your sampling rate is way higher. Let's talk about your 25 MHz sampling rate test. You're saying you took data at this frequency but the FFT looks completely wrong. Have you looked at the time history of the data? Can you identify your event? If the FFT looks wrong and you think you did it correctly, the first place I would look is the time domain.   Regarding the application of a HPF, do you have Simulink? That would make it very easy. You just need the From Workspace block, the Transfer Function block, and a scope or To Workspace block. Create a filter by placing a zero, then a pole (so the zero is at lower frequency than the pole). Make the DC gain low, and boom. Done. HPF. If you don't have simulink, design your filter in the frequency domain then translate it to a differential equation (replace s with d/dt). Then just iterate through time, feeding the derivatives of your signal through the diff eq. The output will be your filtered signal.   Since you are post processing you might want to apply a zero phase loss high pass filter... because you can. This involves taking the output of the first filtering operation then running it backwards through the filter again."

That concept retired with the boomers.  Nobody is really looking out for you except for you. Sad reality. Boomer gen learned this the hard way when all the pensions they toiled away to get fell through. If a company can get away with paying you less, they will. Do not be the pushover.   I will note that you can only job hop so many times in a given period before you look like a liability on paper. Generally you will want to stay in job at least a year before you start looking again.

Not because I am paid below market, or because I want to be paid more than market, simply because changing jobs can really suck.  Especially if changing jobs requires moving.  Double especially if there is a significant other and/or kids in the mix.  Gotta make it worth my while to cause so much chaos in my life, and the life of my family.  But it also isn't a hard and fast rule that anything less than a 25% raise is immediately declined.  I would also take into consideration the benefits package and the company structure itself.  If my new job would put me at or near the top of the pile at a new company (meaning not much room for advancement), 25% might be too low.  If there is lots of room for advancement within the new company and it is near where I already live, 25% might be too high.  As with everything, there is a gradient.  If the resulting salary seems unreasonable for your job, you will know immediately.  If the resulting salary does not allow you to raise or maintain your standard of living in the new arrangement, you will know that immediately.  For changing jobs, a 25% raise is a quick and dirty rule of thumb that you will add and subtract from depending on the details."

If you are good (I have no idea what that means for finance) you can make SERIOUS cash when you're in your early to mid-20's.  Don't do anything big, don't spend a lot of cash, bank it in an interest account, or well, if you're any good, invest the shit (I mean you DO WORK in the field).  Stay 2-3 years before you burn out, take everything and go somewhere where the cost of living is 1/2 the cost, double your savings.

AskEngineers,3e0jce,evanbananas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:25:36 2015 UTC,"So if you got into banking with just a BS originally   I actually went into strategy consulting first with an MBB firm.

You can sort of put in your dues either in consulting or banking -- banking is the more ""sure"" way to do it.    How did you sell yourself to companies and prove that you had the knowledge to be involved in investment banking?   This is actually the easiest part. As an engineer, how much of what you did today was something you learned to do in school? Basically nothing, I'm sure. You learn fundamentals, and then when you get into the workforce, you learn specifics. Same with banking or consulting -- you learn nearly everything on the job. There is usually a technical component to the interview, but it's usually just mental math and some basic finance/accounting, for which there are plenty of cram books you can use without even taking a real course. I did practice quite a bit, but probably didn't need to work quite that hard. It's a lot more important to network, be good at interviewing, be enthusiastic about the company, etc.    In your school years did you only take internships in finance   Actually no... I did two engineering internships. Got an offer from both.    Also how important do you think it would be to have graduated from a top 5 engineering school in order to get into finance?   Top 5 is definitely aggressive, but you do need to go to / have gone to a good school. It can be a great engineering department at a decent school (like the midwestern state schools), or it can be a great school with a decent engineering department (Princeton, for example), or it can be both (Stanford, Berkeley, etc.).

AskEngineers,3e0jce,NittyB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:49 2015 UTC,"The best times to get into finance are at degree points - either right out of undergrad, or right after a Masters (most likely an MBA). Mostly, it's because the recruiting process is built around those huge pipelines and it's harder to field candidates that don't come to you that way (the timing is wrong, they want to do first rounds on campus, they want a big superday, etc). I guess they also like MBAs in general, but in principle you could get a pre-MBA role at a smaller bank if you network your ass off and are only a few years out of school."

If you're a computer scientist, the high frequency and trading firms are all pretty interested in you - the ability to build software to do things humans are too slow to do.   If you want to do banking, you can go get an MBA, and as long as you go to a top 10 or so you should have no problem getting into banking at the associate level.

It's a career that takes a huge amount of discipline, detail orientation, many hours, and is governed by a ton of regulation; it's not for everybody. If you decide you really do want to be on the investing side in VC, it's best if you're young and coming out of a top bank, PE/HF, or consulting firm, and perhaps have an elite MBA already (although some people will say the MBA hurts you.... that's silicon valley for you...)  If you'd prefer to be on the operational side of things, VC-wise, you'll need to have a very strong entrepreneurial record and have something to offer. It's super competitive, and you have to have a very differentiated skill set vs other people that want the job. Those skills are usually around business development, hiring, monetization, and other things startups need to do to get off the ground. You'll have to show your VC overlords that you got a startup off the ground, were super successful, and it wasn't just luck -- and that you can translate that success to their investments.

I did that for a while and now work at a hedge fund, where I look at publicly traded stocks and bonds, and try to pick winners and losers, rather than buying and operating whole companies.   Basically, my day is research and modeling. I go through company reports, I talk to the company's management team (CEO, CFO usually), I build a financial model. I get an opinion on what the business outlook is, then I try to figure out what ""the market"" thinks the outlook is. If I'm different somehow, and I can back up my disagreement with ""the market"" using logic and evidence, then there's a trading opportunity. (Super simple example: Let's say all the analysts think Apple will sell 1M watches. I think they'll sell 100M watches. Therefore, I should buy the stock. It's never this simple.)

I'm not trying to look poorly upon it, I just think like engineers without borders for example would be a amazing opportunity, is there a financial organization that works for the betterment of the less fortunate before diving more into a analyst role.  Also how would you describe the schooling and wages?

In the job, you're typically managing money for huge pensions and retirement funds, among other things. Your performance helps endowments fund scholarships, helps public retirees enjoy a secure retirement, and helps charitable organizations grow their assets.

When you move to a new startup you get a new lottery ticket with a different winning number.  When you stay at your current startup and vest more options, you get another ticket with the same number.  So if you work in startups for 8 years, do you prefer 8 lottery tickets all with the same number, or do you want 8 lottery tickets all with different numbers?  Concentrate your bets, or spread them out?  Employee #99 at Webvan might ALSO have been employee #99 at Facebook.  I myself worked at several startups and received employee stock options from each.

Is there any opportunity for computer engineers to work in the hardware/design side?  I ask because hasn't most computer hardware design like architecture, microcode, and chip design been done to hell by pretty much everyone by now? It feels like nowadays, companies and startups just choose widely available chipsets (e.g. ARM processor), and design software to run on it. In other words, it feels like software is where all the money is right now.  Sort of a long-winded question but I'd appreciate if you could comment on it."
AskEngineers,3e0jce,dangersandwich,9,Tue Jul 21 03:01:56 2015 UTC,"What do you mean done to hell? Arm, Intel, Microchip... all these companies are trying to make faster processors. Designing chip architectures is an iterative process and improvements are incremental. If you mean that we are reaching an upper limit on speed - maybe so, but you can always shove more cores or larger caches on their. And there are always new problems that demand dedicated solutions - VR, bitcoin mining, network integration... My friend recently got a job testing nvidia architecture.  Granted, it's hard to enter in the Microchip manufacturing market since it's very expensive to make them. But dedicated chips are really common."
AskEngineers,3e0jce,Gabe_Isko,4,Tue Jul 21 04:48:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I'm mainly asking for a friend of mine who's a computer engineer but is ignorant of what his degree is capable of, or what career path to take.  Do you have an idea of what the job market is like for those types of jobs? Specifically, ones where you do design work and develop solutions from the ground up, not testing completed products or working on lifecycle stuff."
AskEngineers,3e0jce,dangersandwich,4,Tue Jul 21 06:08:11 2015 UTC,"It's hard to get design work with a bachelors. That's true of any engineering field. From my understanding, micro architecture design is generally considered a masters level job. If your friend is confident that he is qualified based on past experience, you could still just apply to jobs that ask for a masters. It's a pretty ballsy move, but it's not unheard of. Still, the safest route would be to A) get a masters or B) work at a company for a while and then either get promoted or have them pay for your masters. I'm not exactly sure which CE jobs lead to chip design, but I can ask a couple of my friends. I think testing is one of them though.  If he is just looking for a job though, computer engineers are definitely in demand. Tons of stuff uses embedded electronics, and even if you aren't building them, companies want people to help integrate. My university actually doesn't offer a solely computer engineering degree - it is combined with electrical engineering and you either choose to concentrate in power or digital. Everyone I know with that major is in demand though."

I don't think graduate degrees correlate well to effectiveness in industry. That's not to say that graduate degrees are worthless - they're necessary in academia and they're great for getting insanely deep on a subject, but having only a BS doesn't relegate you to be a mindless drone.    Graduate degrees are also great for talking to VCs and people who are into credentials and don't evaluate work on its own merit very well."
AskEngineers,3e0jce,jwhat,3,Tue Jul 21 08:25:41 2015 UTC,"Yes the appropriate phrases in the startups where I worked, would have been long and clumsy.

Employees 51-99 were ""immensely talented engineers whose skills and abilities were known and vouched for, either by one of the first 50 employees, or by a trusted colleague of an employee.

Know your coworkers, know your partnerships, get in good terms with your clients, go to conventions, get training, everything you can do to network out in your field. You can still work an honest living while building your network then when the time comes and you need a good reference to jump to the next rung on the ladder you'll have no problem."

AskEngineers,3e0jce,rex8499,2,Tue Jul 21 19:37:02 2015 UTC,"Offshore to midstream is very similar design wise. The midstream cryo plants can get a little complicated but still fairly simple. Upstream is all about separation of oil, gas and water (for the most part). Midstream is just taking the gas from the wellhead or platform and drying, treating, more separation and compressing it for sales.  Downstream refining is much more complex both from a process and mechanical standpoint but transition wasn't bad. A lot more exotic materials and complex vessel designs but the fundamentals remain. Much more stable workload."

I'm unaware of any way to directly measure a Reynolds number, but if you had such a device, it would be a pretty simple backwards calculation once you accounted for every little detail in the system.    Just off the top of my head: air temperature, prevailing winds, distance to car, boundary layer conditions that will vary for different types and models of cars, vehicle speed, vehicle acceleration, vehicle surroundings (you'll get different turbulences for a car going through a tunnel vs. a car on an open country road), whether the car has been moving for long enough for flow of air around it to be fully developed, pavement temperature, solar heating, precipitation, exhaust location type temperature and volume.

AskEngineers,3e23g1,Science_Monster,4,Tue Jul 21 12:03:00 2015 UTC,Typically you can model wake effect by looking at the vortex shedding of the car.  A simple method would be to use a vortex lattice code with which you can get the induced velocity of the air for every point upstream and down stream of the car.  Then you could parameterize that data in terms of time since your observer will be at a fixed point while your car is driving by.  So you can make a trace of the observer's position relative to the car and plot the xyz induced velocities due to car wake.

Lately we've also been dealing with a lot of EMC issues with server chassis designs - so they've been getting involved with EMI shielding, gaskets, adhesives, labels, etc.      From the design side they create heatsinks, heatpipes, fans, brackets, enclosures, mounting solutions, latches, DFM and DFT.  They occasionally get into LEDs, light pipes, plastic moldings, etc.    Their primary tools are Solid Works and FloTherm, and they spend a fair amount of time dealing with Cadence Allegro and Gerber files.  They also do a fair amount of automation programming in LabView and a fair amount of time doing documentation and technical writing.  Our tolerances are usually in the single digit mils - for larger components a bit more.  But every project/customer/application is different, so the requirements change quite often.  Hope this helps."

AskEngineers,3e30m4,WRSaunders,2,Tue Jul 21 19:40:48 2015 UTC,"Buoyancy is the weight of the fluid displaced.  Under high G, the weight of a liter of anything increases.  If your object's mass doesn't increase, it will need to displace less liquid.  This makes it ""more buoyant""."
AskEngineers,3e30m4,shoozy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:03:08 2015 UTC,"I understand it by applying the same principles that are easily observed in a centrifuge.  As you rotate a centrifuge faster, the denser items move further away from the center of rotation or move in the direction opposite the acceleration (just as in your example).  This movement of the denser material displaces the less dense material and causes it to move towards the center of rotation or, for your example again, towards the direction of acceleration. I believe its simple as that."

Or 'lease' half the plant to someone so you're each selling half to the grid, but most of what your business partner makes will go back to you as the lease. You'd need two meters but depending on how the legislation is worded it might not be too bad.  Anything else you do is a new business that you may not want to get in to. While power costs are a big factor in many businesses, it's far from the only one.

Also, the substation can only handle a total of about 1MW per phase before becoming unbalanced so they need to make sure other people can net meter as well.

I'm an engineer and I work in healthcare at a major academic medical center so I know a lot of doctors young and old.  It's a pretty miserable existence.  Once you're established in your late 30's you'll hopefully find a way to live a normal lifestyle, but the vast majority of the docs I know are still putting in 60+ hour weeks and have to schedule all their time off a year or two in advance.  It's brutal.  And that's not even getting into the experience of researchers or tenure track folks."

And that's unfortunate to hear :( what do you do in healthcare as an engineer?  I don't think I can even spend half a year in an office (the one I'm at is lab/office setting, but all the same IMO) without thinking about blowing my brains out. I want to be in a much more dynamic environment and be directly helping people.  I honestly feel like working as an engineer made me more introverted than I think I am. And with quick research, most of engineering involves being in an office.. :/"
AskEngineers,3dzfus,Bedevilled_Ben,4,Mon Jul 20 21:06:56 2015 UTC,"I'm a former biomed engineer that worked in industry for a few years before going back to med school around age 30.  I'm just starting my 4th year and I'd be happy to answer any questions you have.  Like you, I hated the office setting of engineering and much prefer the hospital.  It is not an easy path, and I think the typical ""engineering"" outlook doesn't translate well to medicine which can make it especially difficult to shift careers like that."

How was your GPA and did you need to take any additional courses or take another undergrad?  Was it worth all the work and risk? How's your financial situation?  edit: Also, how is studying for the course materials differ from engineering? I imagine its more rote memory than conceptual."
AskEngineers,3dzfus,redditor1256,2,Mon Jul 20 21:30:06 2015 UTC,"I was tangentially involved in orthopaedic surgery and interfaced a lot with doctors and nurses and other hospital staff in my previous job doing orthopedic implant design.  I eventually realized that I was more interested in the biology than in the engineering and was kicking around the idea of doing a MD/PhD and focusing more on clinical research.    So I saved up a bit of money, quit my job, took a massive pay cut, and worked as a patient aide in an emergency department after doing much research on the admissions process .  I loved that job so much that I stayed there for almost 3 years while completing some missing pre-req classes (mostly organic chem, a bit of extra biology as well). I also did some volunteer research at an academic hospital to beef up my CV.   My GPA was like a 3.4 or something, no good for US schools.  Not much you can do to change that after 4 years of physics and math. My MCAT score was pretty solid at 32. I applied poorly after getting terrible academic advice and ended up only getting two interviews and no acceptances my first cycle.  So I worked harder, continued doing research....and still didn't get in the second cycle. Being frustrated and impatient, I applied to a couple of the top-tier Caribbean schools and ended up getting accepted and going there.  That is a whole other story with a whole different set of challenges and pitfalls.  Despite that, I've done very well academically and have little doubt that I will be able to secure my preferred residency next spring.   The worth is entirely subjective.  I was miserable as an engineer, and I love medicine.  Even on the 24th hour of a 36 hour shift, I still love it.  When patients are flinging poo at me and cursing me in seven languages, I still love it.  When an untrained $8/hr employee dresses me down in front of the entire floor staff, I still love it.    The cost is expensive.  If you're doing it for money, don't do it.  Reimbursements are going down, costs are going up, and inefficiency is huge.  I'm going to end up close to $300k in debt by the time I'm finished, with a total payback closer to probably $600k after interest. Paying that off on a family practice income is tough.   That said, most still live very comfortably.  You just have to work really really really hard to do it. You won't make shit the first 7 years of your career.  The courses are different in that the volume of information is just insanity.  There are relatively few truly complicated concepts in medicine, but the volume of information that you have to retain, and be able to access quickly, is daunting.  Also, I always felt ""smart"" as an engineer, even when I wasn't.  People see engineers as answer-people that can solve problems.  Doctors don't get that kind of respect anymore.  I can fully manage a patient from the time they walk in the door to the time they leave with perfect medical acumen, diagnose them, prescribe them the right treatment, and they will still think I'm an idiot because I can't get nutrition service to bring them orange juice instead of Diet Coke.  The general public has absolutely ZERO concept of the complexity of medical care, and it can make your job very frustrating at times.   Lemme know if you have any more questions!"

The case presented is based upon solely the evidence presented in the case and demands unbiased judgement. Specialists such as engineers tend to bring in personal knowledge which can sway the minds of an entire jury based on minor technicalities that the rest of the jurors don't know anything about. Essentially the idea is the people of the professions mention have a hard time putting away biases and judging solely on the case presented.

One side of the case brings in an accident reconstruction expert to testify on behalf of the prosecution.  He throws out all of these equations and physics as evidence that the defendant is guilty.  I see that his analysis is flawed (being an engineer).  The defense attorney doesn't catch it and doesn't have an expert witness to refute the analysis.  Am I supposed to just pretend that the analysis is fine, or do I bring in my outside knowledge of engineering to help show the rest of the jury that the evidence is flawed and his testimony shouldn't be considered?"

In some places you can try to get out of jury duty by saying you don't respect the law, or will interpret the case as you see fit. Other places you should look like a thug. In Baltimore (represent) you have to figure that to be the biggest outsider possible you should dress like you work on Wall Street. The defense team doesn't want some unsympathetic fat cat voting guilty on a 20-something year old black male from the inner city just on appearances. If the crime involves a female victim, being a father with a daughter could make you desirable to the prosecution. Oddly enough female jurors would be good for the defense.

If you don't like the case, there are plenty of things you can say to get you excluded, but you really should do your best to be on the jury.  Juries need all the level headed people they can get.

Another panelist was a nurse, I led her through the logic, she agreed, and we let the rest of the jury know what we found.

AskEngineers,3e0vne,titebotine,2,Tue Jul 21 02:30:31 2015 UTC,"Can you confirm that you plan to use the throttle valve to control the pressure vessel inlet flow ? (and not to allow air to escape through an outlet (relief valve)) ? If so, you might want to add a relief valve for safety.  If you assume an unlimited constant pressure, you need to focus on the throttle valve. How is the throttle going to be set during the test : fixed position ? PID controlled ? (manual adjustment ?)  You would need to know the Cv value of the valve (or the complete Cv vs valve position curve) to compute the air flow through the valve depending on the pressure differential. You could use this online calculator. For more information about the equations, look at this ISA standart (Flow Equations for Sizing Control Valves).  I'm not sure you can derive an first order PDE.  BTW :  That make me think about this post on AskEngineers a few days ago. The question was about time needed to pressurize something (a tire) using a centrifugal air compressor, more specificaly, about how to derive an equation to the problem. The PDE wasn't solved. I submited P(t+dt) = P(t) . ( V + [ b - a.P(t) ].dt ) / V (with the given assumption) and I submitted a spreadsheet giving Pmax, P(t), F(t) and dP(t) using an incremental time step approach."

I'm trying to get funding to put in a PID loop/PLCs/HMI/motor operated valve system. That hasn't been approved yet so I'm sticking with my worst case of ""make this dumb system work.""   Your spreadsheet is pretty much exactly what I was looking at creating for my equipment. I'll have to see if I can find the flow coefficient data for that throttle valve.

AskEngineers,3e0vne,Hydromeche,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:17:47 2015 UTC,"If you have a depressurization (rate) limit, you would better not have to use the burst disk during the test, as it would mean a sudden depressurization, which could compromise you pressure vessel. Idem if your valve is a pilot operated safety valve rather than a true pilot operated relief valve. Still, have them ready for safety. (If depressurization rate is an issue, you might also need to consider how you'll depressurize your vessel at the end of the test. Using another valve ?)  Ideally, your pressure source's maximum pressure (see the compressor curve) would be lower than the maximum allowed pressure of your vessel.  If you can use a PID controller (and assuming your valve/loop is quick enough), you don't have much modelizing to do since the pressure rate should follow what you want.  For the spreadsheet, the case was obviously quite different since the problem was with a limited and non constant pressure source (see compressor curve), but you should be able to use the same numerical general approach (which still don't solve your PDE equation) all the more if you use a throttle valve in a fixed position. Considering the valve as part of your pressure source system, you could compute a pressure/flowrate curve for the system and use the same spreadsheet if you use the same hypothesis (ideal gaz and isothermal process)  I'd be happy to see what you can come up with."

Beyond that it's mostly just the cost of copper and aluminum.  As far as why there isn't subsequent news of Tesla's price dropping - they'll charge what the market will bear.

I've had some Sugru before, was pretty stoked about it too.

AskEngineers,3dyd5m,badgerfluff,6,Mon Jul 20 15:19:53 2015 UTC,"Most processing equipment in my field needs to be modified or made from scratch so I have some experience here.  You can use literally any steel that is of 316 grade or higher as the ""food contact surface"". This means the part your food will touch. This is considered food safety zone 1. A light buff job will make it nice and shiny. I recommend experimenting with the thickness of the plate you are cooking on, you will experience bowing if it is too thin. Thin steel is also difficult to weld cleanly so keep that in mind as it will increase production yield loss (cost to you in scrap). You definitely don't need to be looking at anything more than 1/4"" just as a sanity check.   Zone 2 is what supports and surrounds your food contact surface, excluding floors and floor drains, ceilings, etc.  This would include the portion you are considering making out of steel sheet metal. I would recommend building this out of 304 grade stainless steel, and giving it a sandblasted finish. 304 is cheap, still rustproof, and won't corrode easily unless your end user is cleaning it with some nasty stuff. Sandblasting is very cheap and fast and will give you a nice clean matte finish.  I would recommend against using mild sheet steel. You definitely cannot powder coat this thing willy nilly, that is almost certainly a no no. You may be able to find the coating/paint used to paint the inside of grills but i would personally just go with the 304 stainless. The material costs should be fairly close, but more importantly making the piece out of mild steel and then painting may take more time in processing than making it out of stainless and then bead blasting it. I would expect that the quality of paint coat would need to be inspected and that any flaw would result to bleeding brown rust after a few uses, wheras the sandblasting on the stainless part is solely cosmetic and can probably do without quality control and the possibility of rework without much risk. This will be critical to keeping it made in the USA as labor rates are high here, so process time should be minimized.   I would recommend reaching out to a large distributor like Ryerson and buying your stock in bulk just as an additional FYI. You will probably have to do some convincing because the good ones don't sell to individuals, make sure they know you are intending on ordering much larger orders than what you order to test with. You can probably already find sheet/plate in an acceptable thickness and a good distributor will also cut to length, which can be absolutely huge for your production time per unit."

AskEngineers,3dyd5m,dangersandwich,4,Mon Jul 20 16:34:32 2015 UTC,"You'll want to use AISI 300 stainless steel. Also look up 3-A Sanitary Standards, which requires 316 stainless. First, the pieces need to be mechanically finished (e.g. sand and polish) to remove microscopic deposits. The mill might be able to do this for you. Once that's done, they'll need to be passivated with nitric acid to create a chromium oxide layer on the outside, which prevents the iron molecules from oxidizing.  Source: http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/fs119"
AskEngineers,3dyd5m,smh5003,4,Mon Jul 20 15:46:47 2015 UTC,"Passivization is very nice but i would say may be overkill for an application that is constantly going to be constantly  (re)covered in protein fat, leftovers from propane combustion, and gets sterilized each time it is used.  ""Very Nice"" is usually replaced with ""Good Enough"" in terms of consumer goods and if it works for your competitors to do it cheaper then it can also become the difference between ""Not Profitable""  and ""Profitable"""
AskEngineers,3dyd5m,dangersandwich,3,Mon Jul 20 16:17:50 2015 UTC,"I agree, bead blasting is a more economical alternative if passivation isn't needed. Most sheet metal shops will do bead blasting for an extra $50 - $100, per part."

AskEngineers,3dyd5m,bobroberts7441,3,Mon Jul 20 16:09:19 2015 UTC,"Your best best is probably to contact the sheet metal place you used to work at and have them order it for you, especially if they carry steel as inventory because it means they can do a large order and then resell it to you in smaller quantities. Most mills aren't going to care about one guy ordering $500 of steel and probably hang up when you tell them how much you want."

AskEngineers,3dux2z,mck1117,8,Mon Jul 20 05:54:02 2015 UTC,They will just deny you the job probably. And you'd have to get every single hair.
AskEngineers,3dux2z,Account_Admin,2,Mon Jul 20 01:13:36 2015 UTC,"Shaving can work. They won't take from your eyebrows, there's just not enough hair and it would make you look weird. I've dodged a hair test by shaving my whole body and trimming my head free of the 'dirty hair' based on 0.5in growth/month plus a week for the dirty hair to surface (got a surprise job re-offer after a rescinsion for other reasons). They gave me a piss test instead but I had to go back when my hair was long enough.  If you were in really dire straights you could find a look-alike that could pass for you, but that's a pretty extreme measure that could have severe legal consequences if it backfired. They ask you a lot of questions about stuff on your ID to make sure you're the real person before the test IME."

I.e., I abstained for ~2 weeks beforehand, drank lots of water day of, and took a vitamin B12 pill (so pee still yellow despite drinking so much water).  After I got the all clear, I went back to my old habits.  Actually, started smoking more after that, as the fear of ""you'll never amount to anything if you smoke so much"" was taken away.  (It was a great job working on NASA projects; far exceeding parents expectations.  They could not give me shit ever again.)  I don't discuss this with my colleagues, unless I know them very well outside the office.  An anonymous tip could lead to a retest.  Probably wouldn't be fired right away, maybe a substance abuse class?  They'd test more often though, and I'm sure multiple violations would be career ending.  A decade in, I had a bad breakup (understatement), and crazy chick sent some ""anonymous"" letters to various agencies telling lies about me, like I showed up at work stoned every day, and had stolen data.  After a long investigation, I was cleared.  I started to abstain again as soon as I found out, but they never tested me; didn't really care about that part of it and it was obvious I wasn’t high at work.  But potential data breaches get taken seriously.  In the end, the worst thing they found was by auditing my time cards for a month.  I charged 8 hours a day, but the logs of my entry/exit times averaged 7.5 hours.  ""I don't use a stopwatch"" I claimed.  (A lie; I did use a stopwatch, I just didn't pause it over lunch.)  ""Be more careful"" they said.  I was good at my job, made the whole department run smoother; they were motivated to keep me around.  After I was cleared, they investigated the chick for making false statements; no idea what came of that (probably nothing).  I have never applied for security clearance, which has limited my opportunities in the industry somewhat, and raised some eyebrows as I have to give other reasons why I don't want to.  (Politics, not wanting to bother my hippie/artist friends with background check interviews, wanting to continue talking about my cool job at parties, not wanting to work on weapons, etc.)  But really, the issue is the question about drugs.  Smoking pot is an infraction, not even a criminal offense here anymore.  But lying about it on those forms is a felony.  No thank you!  (And being honest about it on those forms is a bad idea.  One colleague told me he answered honestly about taking a hit of a joint passed around at a party a few years prior.  They made him write a fucking essay like a schoolboy, saying he wouldn't do it again.)"

AskEngineers,3dux2z,namo2021,4,Mon Jul 20 07:59:55 2015 UTC,"For some, it has no chance of it affecting your work. For others, it very easily will. For example, I have a coworker who is an alcoholic. He regularly skips work or comes in very late hungover. Of course, he's the reason why we have rules like this. Everyone else can handle themselves, whereas the one person can't.  As for the company being entitled to know what you do, they have a liability with employing people who can be arrested due to their activities. No one cares if you go golfing.

AskEngineers,3dux2z,namo2021,2,Mon Jul 20 19:46:03 2015 UTC,"Post-tax salary, yes. I don't have a perfect view because I'm still getting paid in America even though I'm living abroad, but I saw the numbers that went into my tax return and I would be making significantly less net salary. Number-wise, the gross salaries are similar~ish (maybe a little less), but there's always the EUR/USD conversion to take into account (that is, 60000e/$60000 is common). My effective tax rate in the USA is in the ballpark of 20-25% whereas in Finland it's up to over 40% (""state"" tax was 20%!).  Cost of living in my area is VERY high compared to other European countries, so again my view is a bit skewed. I would find it very hard to have the same savings rate between being an engineer in the USA and an engineer in Finland based off of these two factors alone. However, Finland offers great post-career government benefits, so the need to save for a 401k is less pressing here."

There might be occasional jokes about a work trip to Colorado but that's the extent of it.   I had a roommate in the past who was a bit older and working full time who smoked each and every day after work several times a day. He did fine at his job, but he had a really shitty attitude about work which made me wonder how much of that was due to how much he was smoking. But, he had no issues with tests so I think it really depends. I have other friends and colleagues who never touch it due to tests or simply due to maturing and deciding the risk isn't worth it    I recommend very strongly that you dial it down to a rare indulgence; it will be very necessary to be able to be ready for drug tests and ready to drop the habit altogether with ease.

AskEngineers,3dux2z,GeoffIsSpankman,7,Mon Jul 20 02:35:15 2015 UTC,"My rough-observation is there is an exponential decline in the number of “frequent” users from second year in school to about first year out-of-school.  It is rare to see anyone at this level of consumption after their first year out-of-school because they have either self-selected themselves out, been told to leave because the people you are going to be working with are not fools, or find something of note in their lives and can move beyond frequent use.  In my experience this final category is the most common reason people stop being frequent users – they have nothing beyond it in their lives, and when they find something to focus on (career, a person or people, a calling or fine interest, etc.) it is in fact easy to stop frequent use.  I don't think I have seen a frequent user who I would ever refer to as “mature,” regardless of age.  As to occasional users – it depends on your environment and workplace regs.  Anecdotally, the best commentary I have heard on this was by a heavy-equipment operator I worked with: “I miss it, but I have to piss clean to keep this job.  And this job is worth way more than an occasional high.” But, beyond that, even if you are in an environment that is tolerant of it, or at least non-inquisitive, the moment it affects your work – well, this ain't Kindergarten.

I decided that if our clandestine organizations were at all effective, then they must also be logical, otherwise if either proved to be untrue I would self-terminate employment for the govt myself. As such being my core beliefs, and having a close friend that is a field agent for a division of the NSA, I chose the route that they ""seek honesty not angels.""  Oh the irony. I was terminated because it was a private firm that hired me for EW work and failed to attain my interm prior to me onboarding like normal companies would do..

I could rat out at least 20 people who are PMs inside of very secret R&D agencies. Instead I marvel at the hyprocacy and how brutal that fact was to learn.    Every single person who is effective in their work in the clandestine community has experienced a lot of different things. That is why they are who they are. It's about what you believe, and your capacity to be of value that should be measured.

AskEngineers,3dyb1q,smh5003,2,Tue Jul 21 01:51:19 2015 UTC,"You are pretty much straight out of school. Did you have any experience working in engineering prior to this appointment (internships? coops?)?.  I am assuming you are working in manufacturing as I do. I started out in your role with a few additional project based responsibilities because of my intern work.   I am going to speak from anecdotal experience. I think you feel like something is missing because you aren't yet living the ""ops consultants'"" mission. I think ""process engineer"" is a pretty shitty term and i prefer internal operational consultant for several reasons.    The first reason is that it actually has the word ""operations"" in the title. That word encompasses why your job position exists, to assist with ""operations"", aka ""the production of the object(s) that are part of our organizational mission statement"". This means if you are a ""process engineer"" in automotive manufacturing then you are really ""a process expert who is a production consultant for mid to upper level operations management, and oh yeah none of that matters, all that really matters is how many cars we got out this shift"".   The second reason is that I assume you are not actually embedded into a production group, but that you are probably rather a part of an engineering team. This seems logical because you are placed with like minds but it unquestionably increases the disconnect between technical subject matter experts, such as your self, and the operation itself.   Third: something that has probably been repeated to you in academia is ""to let the process lead"" or to be ""process centric"", and that is the line of thought most engineers maintain. The problem is that no customer is the world is paying for the ""process"", rather they are paying for the ""results"", which are distinctly different. This ""process"" focus leads engineers to design and build projects that amount to be very expensive science experiments but that don't actually do anything to help production... You can see evidence of this daily in your own work by asking older employees for examples of how we have tried to implement Lean, Six Sigma,  SCRUM, ISO9XXXXX, etc... The ""process experts"" who ran these implementations will say they followed the prescribed process to the T, and that someone else just didn't do their job.... well that is always the excuse, and if you ask the people on the production side you will get a different story.  So to sum up my point:   Go work with the production guys, from the lowest operator all the way up to the plant manager.  A mediocre engineer with a good working relationship with these people will be twice as effective as someone with 5-10 years of experience who sits in their office all day and won't get dirty. You will quickly find that eliciting good actionable information from these people is an art in itself. This is increasingly true the lower rank the operator, but these operators also know where the lowest hanging fruit is in terms of operational improvement. Build up a rep for helping these people and then find a way to get into the plant managers morning meeting, or weekly production summary meeting. etc... Listen to what people are saying; is there a production metric that people are focusing on? A lot of manufacturers hang on a single metric, like plant cost per ton of production. Find out how this ""key process indicator"" is calculated and work backwards using your rigorous problem solving methodology to drive improvements. You will see the fruits of your work and you will actually be ""part"" of something instead of living in an engineering silo where three or four guys that have no clue how a process works is going to decide how $10MM in capital will be allocated over the next year. Long story short a bunch of people getting paid your salary x10 decided things were better this way, welcome to middle class america."
