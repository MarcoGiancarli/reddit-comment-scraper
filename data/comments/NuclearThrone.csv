NuclearThrone,3e2qnw,Mate9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:51 2015 UTC,"I was worried that something along these lines would crop up as they recently changed the beam to be a lot more detail-oriented.

NuclearThrone,3e36ad,ik1ne,7,Tue Jul 21 16:34:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even with the nerf/buff it's still great.  It's also a good idea to throw your active as Plant at the start of the throne fight.  This means it can't run you down and if you have Throne Butt it'll go down the moment it drops below 33%."
NuclearThrone,3e36ad,damimp,2,Tue Jul 21 16:50:23 2015 UTC,What? Does Plant's active hold the Throne? Wow. Didn't know that. Should try that next time.
NuclearThrone,3e36ad,damimp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:55 2015 UTC,"It sure does!  Slows it right down to barely a crawl, which is great for getting up close and collecting ammo and stuff."
NuclearThrone,3e36ad,TheProudBrit,0,Tue Jul 21 17:19:05 2015 UTC,Especially with how it is now with the damn Guardians...
NuclearThrone,3e36ad,ledraps,3,Tue Jul 21 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"Plant's good with the bosses that rely on movement as a threat. BB wont charge through cover, the throne wont run you over, and lil hunter wont strafe around (as long as he doesnt jet pack out)  An easy nerf would be to allow bosses to move out of the snare. BB can destroy the snare if he charges, lil hunter should fly up if he's caught in the snare for more than 3 seconds, and the throne should be able to destroy the snare with its primary beam attack.  We've gone from 50% to 33%, I dont think it needs any more nerfing, but rather the slow down effect plant has does. Cheesing the throne comes from locking it down and collecting its drops as I slowly kill it with my pop gun or screwdriver."
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,SliverCrepes,22,Tue Jul 21 01:04:20 2015 UTC,"I still think that the situation played out different than it should have. Bottom line, the devs had a problem with Chicken and instead of adjusting the ability she's had for so long so that it was more reflexive like Crystal's ability with a short use and longer cooldown, they ditched it for a gimmicky new active.   Their best bet, honestly, is to revert and adjust. I don't see that happening, though. They've already implemented the idea and they like their gimmick. It's attracted new players that enjoyed Hotline Miami, and publicity is the name of the game so close to a final product.  In theory, her active works. If you're out of ammo, throw your weapon. At 24 damage, a great amount of monsters will die with a direct hit. So, you throw your weapon when you have the opportunity.  In practice, it doesn't work out this way for most people, I feel is the general consensus of those speaking against it. Most weapons do more than 24 damage in the amount of time you can throw the weapon and retrieve it or wait for its return. You're better off to carry an Auto Crossbow and Flame Shotgun and just watch your ammo, the name of the game, really.  In the early game, the ability can be useful - a slightly more powerful crossbow shot that actually makes Chicken Sword useful. A few levels in, it loses effectiveness exponentially. In the late game, it's like a tertiary weapon that uses your own guns for ammo - a new take on Horror's beam. Really, the focus on the ability only works if you don't have two guns that do more damage over time than the thrown weapon, which is a rare and pretty shotty setup. If you're stuck in that situation, I feel kind of bad for you. Sure, you might have piercing, but it's basically a ""Medium Crossbow.""  I appreciate the new ability, but I don't think it's strong enough. I'm not swayed to take it over Ultra A, ""Harder to Kill."" I should have to think about it, it's the final mutation. The ultimate mutation. It just doesn't feel ultra.  Again, I doubt we'll see any real changes - a new active altogether. I do think that more tweaking will come with the dissatisfaction many have had."
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,Beardalelist,11,Tue Jul 21 01:42:04 2015 UTC,"I would say that the throwing ultra needs to be part of the basic active just to make it usable.  Then make the thrown weapon damage scale in some way.  Maybe base it on ""weight"", maybe on ammo used per shot, maybe on min difficulty for the weapon to appear.  Lastly, give chicken a new and awesome ultra.  Perhaps thrown weapons return reloaded, or weapons have a chance to fire on impact, or fire rate on your other weapon is increased until the thrown weapon returns to your inventory."
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,fuzzywolf23,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:59:21 2015 UTC,Those are very reasonable ideas. I like your comment all around.
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,Beardalelist,9,Tue Jul 21 04:19:11 2015 UTC,"Good points were raised up.  In the end, it feels like a gimmick ability and whenever I see extremely good streamers using Chicken occasionally, they ignore the active completely because they know how....bad and unintuitive it is.  Before you get Ultra B, you can't even gauge where your weapon's going to end up after you throw it away.  There's no auto-pickup for weapons so it's tedious to use it semi-frequently.  All in all, it feels like the developers threw away a very interesting ability for Hotline Miami gimmicks that don't work in a game that's not Hotline Miami."
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,Beardalelist,7,Tue Jul 21 01:48:12 2015 UTC,"Essentially. The only real benefit Chicken has now is her built-in ""Weak Spirit,"" or poorer version of Strong Spirit i.e. Hard to Kill."
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,Gammer001,5,Tue Jul 21 02:08:28 2015 UTC,"I still think that the situation played out different than it should have. Bottom line, the devs had a problem with Chicken and instead of adjusting the ability she's had for so long so that it was more reflexive like Crystal's ability with a short use and longer cooldown, they ditched it for a gimmicky new active.                                                                       The main reason they ditched her active was because it was inherently counter to the way the rest of the game was. Constant action and dodging and whatnot. Whether you or I agree is another story but that is why they changed it. Good points though."
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,Beardalelist,4,Tue Jul 21 03:16:44 2015 UTC,"I can understand that as well. I recall them saying that it was too jarring and slowed the game down too much. Sorry if I glanced over that.   Thanks for keeping it civil and helping towards a more fruitful discussion.  Personally, I understand the dodging and action, but it feels forced. To intentionally endanger yourself by tossing a weapon is reckless, although reasonably fun by some standards. There isn't enough incentive as it stands to actually use the ability for me. It may be another story for other players, but that is my experience on the matter."
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,Dirst,6,Tue Jul 21 03:38:00 2015 UTC,"I could see it having scaling damage based off of how much damage it looks like your weapon might do if it hit something real hard. Like, a thrown Revolver, Laser Pistol, or Splinter Pistol might only do 6 damage or something, but melee weapons like Chicken Sword might do a lot more, and super-heavyweights like Double Minigun and the SPC doing 30+.  Or just rework Chicken again. Even if every throw did 50 damage, it's still barely worth losing your weapon for it. I had an idea for a different character in the past that would work well I think. Active throws a Shuriken at the cost of 1 bolt ammo (she would start with some bolts as well), doing 6-7 damage or so. Less than Crossbow or even Splinter Pistol, but is a usable weapon without costing a weapon slot. TB upgrades it to a thrown Kunai that does maybe 16 or so damage (crossbow is 20). Fits with Chicken's wannabee Eastern lore, and I think it'd be a good mechanic. Less damage than real weapons at the same ammo cost, but being able to attack while using other weapons would be a nice perk. Imagine those clutch situations where you've fired your Plasma Cannon, you just killed an enemy with your Heavy Slugger, an Assassin is sneaking up on you, and you turn around and toss a Kunai in his face just in time while both your weapons are reloading.  I dunno. What are paragraphs."
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,Gammer001,3,Tue Jul 21 04:11:03 2015 UTC,"I use her active early game, for say scorpions or big maggots. It can also kinda be used on big bandit for a somewhat quick kill, especially since I usually wait until the Sewers to open any chests in the hopes of getting a heavy crossbow out of the big chest there. My main issue is that it doesn't scale well. I think it only really scales with throne butt, and even then not a whole lot. Not enough to make me take and keep using it past the dessert anyway. I think an auto pickup system would be the way to go, for sure. Even give her a little more range for the pickup on a weapon tied to that."
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,Beardalelist,3,Tue Jul 21 03:11:31 2015 UTC,"That's basically my stance on it more or less. If the ability scaled with weapon weight, for instance, that would be very interesting for the late game. If Cannons would basically be two Heavy Bolts worth of damage."
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,RedXIII304,3,Tue Jul 21 03:41:19 2015 UTC,"It needs a quality of life adjustment, like if you walk over a weapon and have an empty slot you automatically pick it up."
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,schist_,3,Tue Jul 21 05:25:35 2015 UTC,"What if instead of piercing, her throne butt was boomerang weapons?"
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,QTheNew42Q,2,Tue Jul 21 08:11:25 2015 UTC,"Her new active is really fun, but ends up killing you most of the time. The only real downside though is that you become completely defenseless for a while spamming e to pick up a weapon that won't go into your fucking primary slot. Her Throne Butt just makes the problem even worse. If you get throne butt, accidentally right-clicking can be deadly."
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,ThePigWarrior,2,Tue Jul 21 02:43:50 2015 UTC,"I think the throw should scale with the difficulty, and so should the Chicken Sword. That way it makes carrying the Sword through the game, instead of dumping it over the first weapon you find."
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,Acheroni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:19 2015 UTC,"It definitely needs work. It just isn't worth using, even if it hits and kills.  It needs some extra effect to make it worthwhile, like maybe a thrown weapon gets more powerful as it kills, or it replenishes ammo on a kill. My personal favorite idea is to have time slow down while the weapon is flying, and you still move at the same speed. Kind of a mix between the old power and the new."
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,UniversalSnip,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:06:35 2015 UTC,why not make it work like the gun gun where what you throw fires continuously as it travels?
NuclearThrone,3e0l22,stevaloo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:24:24 2015 UTC,"Chicken needs boomerangs.  Also, throne butt should be changed to thrown weapon will fire off a shot when it connects."
NuclearThrone,3e3fcc,Beardalelist,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:38 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed this Plant run. I've done several since and had similar luck.  Do you miss the 40% Thronebutt, or do you think that the difference is negligible? For those of you around when 50% was the status quo, do you think that the game has changed for better or for worse?"

NuclearThrone,3e0jau,toxicbox,4,Tue Jul 21 00:56:16 2015 UTC,"That went right over my head while thinking about the topic. The game is so far along in development that they've recently made clear that the game will more than likely stay at 30 FPS for ease of programming and stability.  I can definitely see some interesting fan adaptations being built to circumvent this barrier, though. For instance, /u/Nommiin built his own version from the ground up as 60 FPS. Maybe fan adaptations will become more mainstream as the final product draws closer."
NuclearThrone,3e0jau,sociodouble,5,Tue Jul 21 01:04:14 2015 UTC,Steroids doesn't seem to get much attention.
NuclearThrone,3e0jau,A_BEAUTIFUL_PONY,3,Tue Jul 21 01:04:29 2015 UTC,"Very true. I think Steroids has gone untouched for a very long time just because of his simple design. Left click, left weapon, right click, right weapon. There isn't much to change in that respect. His passives make sense and they don't cause trouble. I, too, would be surprised to see change coming for Steroids."
NuclearThrone,3e0jau,Zeocis,3,Tue Jul 21 01:07:16 2015 UTC,I'd like to see some changes to his Ultras... They seem very underwhelming.
NuclearThrone,3e0jau,Shamison,2,Tue Jul 21 01:41:15 2015 UTC,"They are. I can confirm that. I think that Steroids is more of a ""fun"" character, though. What other character can you get double Ultra weapons every level, or have peace of mind for ammo?  I'd like Steroids to keep those traits or chances of double weapons if at all possible, but changes to his Ultras would be an interesting and novel change."
NuclearThrone,3e0jau,sociodouble,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:44:40 2015 UTC,It wasn't that long ago that they changed steroids. He used to have only dual wielding and his throne but gave him fully automatic weapons and made 1 in every 5 shots not cost ammo. I don't remember when that change was but I honestly don't think it happened ages ago.

""It's not fair, it's not right""  He's definitely the only challenging boss, and to top it off, his attack patterns are so erratic that everything from that point on feels so slow.

NuclearThrone,3dz5bf,RedXIII304,3,Mon Jul 20 23:52:00 2015 UTC,"Gotta bring the right weapons for 0-1. Also gotta learn how bad enemies are at aiming so you can dodge all the IDPD. When I say bad, I mean they shoot straight at you every time, so they'll never hit if you walk sideways."
NuclearThrone,3dz5bf,Dirst,2,Tue Jul 21 00:14:02 2015 UTC,"What weapons work best? I think I had a heavy slugger last time I remember, a laser would've saved me from the shielder though."
NuclearThrone,3dz5bf,RedXIII304,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:18:33 2015 UTC,"Heavy Slugger's a pretty bad weapon in general. I like to always carry an anti-Shielder weapon (lasers, lightning, melee, bolts) as well as a high damage ammo sink type weapon for taking down the ghost Throne, and Auto Crossbow fills both roles. I think if you have an Auto Crossbow, you can probably do multiple loops regardless of secondary weapon."
NuclearThrone,3dz5bf,Dirst,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:57:13 2015 UTC,Started out with playing a lot with Melting. Not sure if that is the reason or something else. Took me 14 hours-ish to first loop

NuclearThrone,3dyn0u,Sgt_Barrel,2,Mon Jul 20 16:30:48 2015 UTC,This bug has been around for a while. Probably a problem with depth.
NuclearThrone,3dy37d,TmrGast,5,Mon Jul 20 14:03:03 2015 UTC,I think that a big part of the appeal of this game is how incredibly different gameplay is with so many of the mutants.  Giving the lowest hp mutant a rediculously powerful attack (as it is currently) makes him much more interesting than if he had the highest defence imo.  Similarly I think it's ok for the highest hp mutant to have the best defence because she's also the one with the lowest attack power.
NuclearThrone,3dy37d,Emc73,0,Mon Jul 20 14:27:32 2015 UTC,It just seems a little overkill on crystal's survivability
NuclearThrone,3dy37d,MajorStupidity11,4,Mon Jul 20 14:47:44 2015 UTC,"The point of the nerf was to make her less OP, which she now is.  I'm fine with her in the current state, but Old Crystal was much more fun and OP."
NuclearThrone,3dy37d,Valliac,3,Mon Jul 20 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"I agree. You can make her a monster with Rhino Skin, Bloodlust, Second Stomach, Rabbit Paw, and Ultra A.

NuclearThrone,3dwcyv,epic_potatoe,4,Mon Jul 20 02:09:42 2015 UTC,TFW I'm at 31 hrs and the farthest I've got is Palace stage 2.
NuclearThrone,3dwcyv,8988303682,2,Mon Jul 20 07:40:28 2015 UTC,I'm at 40ish hours and just now getting to the palace consistently.   I feel so ashamed. Good job on the loop.
NuclearThrone,3dwcyv,Valliac,2,Mon Jul 20 16:11:03 2015 UTC,Nice. Does it feel good having all that hard work pay off?(Now you just have to start looping) Not sure my hours since offline mode doesnt record it. Just beat it with fish wave gun and energy sword. If you can loop consistently you should try gun warrant it can be really fun.
NuclearThrone,3dwa5h,Venemouse,5,Mon Jul 20 01:44:04 2015 UTC,"What about having it use 5 bolts and make it penetrate everything that is not a wall, and do exactly 60 damage."
NuclearThrone,3dwa5h,LITTLE-GUNTER,3,Mon Jul 20 03:41:34 2015 UTC,"1 bolts, has a little delay like laser cannon."
NuclearThrone,3dwa5h,Swo117,2,Mon Jul 20 10:45:43 2015 UTC,"Isn't a hyper launcher a pseudo railgun?  An explosively powerful single shot bolt would be awesome. The nuke launcher of bolt weapons (idk, I guess energy ammo is also appropriate)."
NuclearThrone,3dwa5h,stevaloo,2,Mon Jul 20 22:19:48 2015 UTC,"Yes! WIth so many awesome guns in game it's surprising that the railgun, one of the most classic of awesome guns, isn't in it."
NuclearThrone,3dwa5h,professorMaDLib,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:50:35 2015 UTC,i cant place it but for some reason i like the idea :p  but in all seriousness it could be a pretty interesting weapon if designed in the right way. i kind of like the idea of the shockwave damage
NuclearThrone,3dxyl7,xAlfafllfflx,2,Mon Jul 20 13:22:29 2015 UTC,Trigger Fingers makes all slow-firing weapons insanely fun.
NuclearThrone,3dxyl7,TheLonelyPotato666,2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:16 2015 UTC,Plutonium Hunger for sure. It allows you to play much more safely.
NuclearThrone,3dxyl7,RedXIII304,3,Mon Jul 20 23:53:59 2015 UTC,I'll say what everyone is afraid to say.  I like hammerhead
NuclearThrone,3dxyl7,Problematicar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:13 2015 UTC,Bolt Marrow probably tops the list. Followed by Rabbit Paw and Bloodlust.
NuclearThrone,3dxyl7,Valliac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:20:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Once made a Heavy Bolt curve through three Snowbots, swerve around a corner and blow up a tank."
NuclearThrone,3dxyl7,LITTLE-GUNTER,2,Mon Jul 20 17:30:58 2015 UTC,"And if you snag an Auto Heavy, the game just gives up"
NuclearThrone,3dxyl7,CryoCrisis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:44:08 2015 UTC,Indeed. Even with the nerfs it's still amazing.
NuclearThrone,3dxyl7,LITTLE-GUNTER,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:13:55 2015 UTC,"Bloodlust, Lucky Shot, and Trigger Fingers scale super well into the late game.  They're a trifecta of defense, sustainability, and offense!  Hammerhead is really, really good for avoiding BS Spawns and for use as a safety ticket.  I take it as a replacement for Strong Spirit usually."
NuclearThrone,3dus1f,CotRA,4,Sun Jul 19 17:59:22 2015 UTC,"So basically, if you're curious what multiple player spawn does:     The game spawns multiple versions of the player, but each has their own HP and pickups. This basically means that everyone has their own ammunition and health pool and weapons aren't shared. Every spawned mutant reacts to the player's input. So if you use pop pop, all player entities fire their guns. If you try to go back to the menu the game just restarts and gives you another player, there's no escape unless you quit or die. Copies follow you around until they die, then the HUD blanks out. The game only ends when all players are dead. You can airhorn.wav in the portal and Yung Venuz shakes around."
NuclearThrone,3dus1f,Aldahe,3,Sun Jul 19 18:07:57 2015 UTC,"This is a hilarious bug, has anyone tried doing this with rebel and spawned minions to see if it stacks?"
NuclearThrone,3dus1f,Harakou,3,Sun Jul 19 19:13:59 2015 UTC,"Oh god, I really wanted to do that, but missed the chance."
NuclearThrone,3dus1f,Aldahe,3,Sun Jul 19 19:29:25 2015 UTC,It does. You could have dozens of allies on the screen.

NuclearThrone,3dvovy,bfoster543,3,Sun Jul 19 22:37:16 2015 UTC,"Throne Butt by itself is a nerf, the entire change was a mix of both a nerf and a buff. Crystal's supposed to be a quick-shield now instead of a turtle."
NuclearThrone,3dvovy,riceyricedude,0,Mon Jul 20 00:10:20 2015 UTC,"Here's why I'm confused, the patch note says:  ""Reworked Crystal, with a more mobile, snappier shield, usable Throne Butt""  Implying it was not usable before the patch but is usable now.  So that means either:  1) Vlambeer fucked up, not realizing it was good before and sucks now. 2) Like you're saying they actually did mean to nerf, that must mean that the patch notes are a troll?"
NuclearThrone,3dvovy,riceyricedude,2,Mon Jul 20 00:19:47 2015 UTC,"Well, the wording's weird. The original Throne Butt was overpowered because of high mobility, ability to phase through obstacles, as well as the fact that you're invincible after you teleport, assuming you keep the shield up. I personally believe Vlambeer meant it as 'not-as-abusable-as-before'."
NuclearThrone,3dvovy,spatsi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:49:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with all that and that's why I played almost exclusively teleport style before, but at the same time nobody else used it.  I spent some time looking for streamers and there are almost no Crystal players.  Squerc is the best I found and he's amazing, but his style is a lot more turtle-ish.  I never found anyone that actually abuses teleport such that it resulted of top daily finishes (like Squerc has done with his fortress/gamma guts stuff).  So, one style of play has been completely killed and it wasn't even the best style, while the other styles get buffed, it's a little confusing.  Lowering the shield duration was a great change though, the longer duration promoted boring play and turtling, but a usable teleport promotes more aggressive styles and diverse play.  Maybe somewhere in the middle is the way to go?  A slight delay instead of a super long one might make teleport playable again."
NuclearThrone,3dvovy,BehindJK,3,Mon Jul 20 01:00:41 2015 UTC,"I actually do like the new Throne Butt. With the previous one, it was too easy to accidentally teleport right into the enemy."
NuclearThrone,3dvovy,BehindJK,0,Mon Jul 20 01:27:38 2015 UTC,"You had to put time into learning it, but once you did it was really powerful and rewarding."

NuclearThrone,3duhc0,RoDDusty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:49:17 2015 UTC,"Well, was. The wrong build of the game accidentally went live, which is why things were so crazy. It had a lot of experimental features and dev shortcuts."

NuclearThrone,3dspd3,stewartisme,0,Sun Jul 19 12:20:30 2015 UTC,"...why not?? 60fps would make the game much smoother and more enjoyable to play, why is support restricted to the developer build?"
NuclearThrone,3dspd3,gtdp,3,Sun Jul 19 12:37:59 2015 UTC,"This is not a dev build, it's (probably) a modification of Update 20 code. AFAIK /u/Nommiin is not a Vlambeer developer.  The reason why we won't see 60 fps is that the whole game was made in Game Maker, and Game Maker ties game mechanics to game frame rate, in this case 30fps. Double the framerate and everything becomes double as fast."
NuclearThrone,3dspd3,LITTLE-GUNTER,3,Sun Jul 19 12:52:31 2015 UTC,He made the engine himself. It's not modified nuclear throne.
NuclearThrone,3dspd3,ledraps,2,Sun Jul 19 20:13:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not a developer for Vlambeer, this is actually an engine I made in my spare time (from the ground up, not based on Update 20)  It's made in GMS, and I just started the engine with a focus on on 60 FPS"

NuclearThrone,3dw1ot,QTheNew42Q,3,Mon Jul 20 00:28:21 2015 UTC,I think his Boomerang Ult should be his TB and his ult should give piercing and more damage (or a different buff to make it worthy of an Ultra).
NuclearThrone,3dw1ot,RedXIII304,2,Mon Jul 20 05:14:52 2015 UTC,yes. this
NuclearThrone,3dw1ot,Fblthp_is_god,2,Mon Jul 20 04:57:59 2015 UTC,"I think the changes to chicken are interesting, but also a little bit gimmicky. I would say make it so she can pick up weapons and return them to her secondary slot just by walking over them, instead of having to pick them up with E again (because that's just far too slow in the heat of combat). Also, the boomerang ability from her ultra mutation should be added to her thronebutt (without removing the current effect of the thronebutt, since you basically need the boomerang ability if you also have the piercing, causing the weapons to be further away from you when they stop). The new ultra mutation that replaces the boomerang one should be her old slow down effect + thronebutt (where the world is slowed down but you are walking at full speed). I miss that matrix feeling of dodging every shot SO MUCH and I wish they'd put it back in some way. I think putting it in as an ultra mutation, in it's old thronebutt'd form, would be the best course of action."
NuclearThrone,3dw1ot,NaomiNekomimi,2,Mon Jul 20 06:25:12 2015 UTC,"I think both the Chicken Throw should scale with weapon damage and current dificulty, and so shuold the Chicken Sword.

NuclearThrone,3ducpe,Parafusion14,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:46:17 2015 UTC,"I believe he started with crown of blood, which isn't legit.

As the OP says here, at first glance that isn't true at all, it was a massive nerf.  So did they:  1) Nerf it on accident, not realizing how strong it was before, as the patch notes imply  2) They were trolling in the patch notes and actually did mean to nerf it."
NuclearThrone,3dufp4,bfoster543,2,Mon Jul 20 00:48:09 2015 UTC,"It was purposeful and they aren't trolling. Before you teleported instantly which seems good at face value. The only actual uses for teleporting are making sure you get you drops, or getting to safety. Since getting to safety means there is imminent danger, then being able to focus down to where you need to go to is difficult. Now you can shield into safety and take a couple seconds to think about your next move, also making crystal more noob friendly which is one of her key strengths in design. A shorter shield isn't that big of a deal, plus it forces you to teleport a little quicker than otherwise."
NuclearThrone,3dufp4,Gammer001,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:10:14 2015 UTC,"Instant teleport was ridiculously good for my style anyway, how much time did you put into learning it?  For me it's such a big nerf I can barely bring myself to play... it's like logging into world of warcraft and seeing the patch notes are ""we've decided to delete the warrior class from the game"", and my max level character vanished out of thin air.  That's how much time I spent playing teleport, hundreds of hours.  I'm not trying to argue from authority, if I'm wrong and you really have played a ton of teleport I'd love to hear more details on why you stopped."
NuclearThrone,3dufp4,bfoster543,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:44:08 2015 UTC,"I've played a fair amount, not as much as you for sure. I think the key to crystal's design is noob friendliness and obviously needing to practice throne butt for a long time is a bit counteractive. Don't get me wrong, I love those high skill ceilings but it's definitely better reserved for things like 11 loops or CoB melting kinda stuff."
NuclearThrone,3dufp4,Gammer001,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:03:13 2015 UTC,"Who cares about the design intent originally, even if it was an accident the end result was that teleport crystal was insanely fun and dynamic to play, why make it boring instead?  Noobs will die over and over in this game regardless of these tweaks, it's a hardcore game."
NuclearThrone,3dufp4,bfoster543,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:44:23 2015 UTC,"Also, the shorter shield was a great change i agree 100% on that, it pushes towards much more dynamic play and I'm a big fan of it.  Maybe I'm biased because I just watched Evo today, but there's a reason why Smash Melee is still the preferred game for competitive play over the newer Smash games... super high skill ceiling.  Nuclear Throne is a hardcore game, not a casual one, I'd much rather see high skill ceiling mechanics like the old teleport that reward extra practice."

NuclearThrone,3dufp4,Pink_Fluid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:32:51 2015 UTC,"It was really good before the patch, just really tough to learn how to use.  It's not very intuitive initially because we're all used to right clicking to shield when in danger, all while having the cursor forward and firing the whole time - when you're first learning how to teleport that means a lot of landing right on top of dudes and dying.  To use it effectively you had to play much differently with and without throne butt, it was a lot of fun and I hope the nerf was an accident."
NuclearThrone,3dufp4,metroid_slayer,4,Mon Jul 20 00:49:45 2015 UTC,"I always thought Throne Butt was the most fun part of Crystal. I practically never used her active to block damage, because it didn't work well with Throne Butt. This change actually means that You can block with your cursor on open space and then move it to a wall to cancel the teleport, which makes the shield more usable under normal circumstances while keeping most of the functionality of the shield."

NuclearThrone,3dqlli,Battle_Bee,2,Sat Jul 18 18:28:48 2015 UTC,"It's extremely simple. Mouse wheel to select what tile you want to place, left-click to place, right-click to delete.

Or you can control how long a Timer tile waits before activating whatever it's connected to."

NuclearThrone,3dsijg,rewindthegamer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:04:36 2015 UTC,"I guess this is because thronebutt only updates every couple of minutes (every 10 min I think). And your daily wasn't done yet when thronebutt updated for the last time yesterday's daily, and the next time thronebutt updated the new daily had already rolled around, and it doesn't record the couple of missing scores from the daily before that if a new one has already rolled around I guess.  This is just my guess.  The best thing to do is try and finish your dailies at least more than 10 minutes (again, I think that's the update frequency) before the new one rolls around.  You can always report it to the admin of thronebutt (contact info is on the website), and maybe he can even try and fix it if it's possible."
NuclearThrone,3dsijg,Stef-Verzelen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:00:17 2015 UTC,"So, you don't think runs that carry over into when the next one is open are recorded? It would surprise me if none of those crazy 5+ hour, 20k+ kill daily runs went over, but I guess it's possible they didn't. It's really not that big of a deal, just a little annoying it had to be one of my better runs."
NuclearThrone,3dsijg,i542,3,Sun Jul 19 09:57:29 2015 UTC,"Hi. I coded the site!  /u/Stef-Verzelen is right - the site is updated with new scores every 10 minutes (at :05, :15, :25, etc.) with the scores from the current daily and the all-time scores are updated twice every hour to prevent excessive load on the database. The reasons for the first are that Steam has a limit on how often can you pull from its servers and that there's a lot (several thousand) scores and players that need to be updated each day, and I don't want to overload the database. The reason for the second is that every time the all-time leaderboards have to update, the system has to go through all ~450000 scores and calculate totals for all ~50000 players.   The daily run is supposed to last for 24 hours - so, you're supposed to start and finish within those 24 hours. All 20k+ kill daily runs have conformed to that. I do periodically update all leaderboards while performing database maintenance for consistency with Steam leaderboards, but that's on average twice every month.  I do, however, have to update the site today or tomorrow with a few new additions, so I will add another job to check for the previous day's scores once at the end of the day (when the site performs its last update and tweets out the daily winner). That means everyone will have 48 hours to finish a daily run in order for it to appear on the website."

Although I do think his TB should be buffed, I don't think it should be as complex as what you're thinking of. My idea would be that he creates a ""water wave"" in front of him while rolling that deals 0 damage, but will reflect/destroy projectiles. An easier way to explain this is while you are rolling, you have a constant wrench swing in the direction you are rolling that deals no damage.  Edit: To clarify, the water wave replaces the current TB, it won't add to it."
NuclearThrone,3dqimv,8988303682,2,Sat Jul 18 15:58:41 2015 UTC,"I like this! It doesn't make you invincible because you can still be struck from the side or by contact damage, but it's a worthwhile upgrade.

NuclearThrone,3dqimv,geckojsc,2,Sat Jul 18 16:35:08 2015 UTC,"I think I'd prefer that TB if it didn't make the roll infinite like the current TB does, and is just the normal roll with a water wave in front.

NuclearThrone,3dqimv,Dirst,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:02:33 2015 UTC,Your comment is a little difficult to understand but I think you have the wrong idea. The water wave replaces his current TB. It would be the exact same as without TB except for the deflector in front.

Pyromaniac  Homing explosives  Panic Mode  50% chance to explode when hit. Player is immune to this explosion  Shake Wake  Your corpse flies further and hits harder on death.

And I understand how explosives don't have a mutation, but i think boiling veins is good enough unless you have a flame weapon or jackhammer.  Also Panic Mode would be completely useless as Rogue and seems too much like a shorter ranged version of Sharp Teeth.  Unfinished Business is just an overpowered version of Strong Spirit,  Shake Wake is pretty much infinite lives if you get to a loop, transition level, or if the labs has 20 necromancers.   Bonus Calories is a much weaker version of Gamma Guts,  Aggressive Nature(for me and probably not anyone else) would make people try to save their first shot for a Golden Scorpion or Rhino or Salamander etc. and die because you haven't even shot a single enemy yet.  No Pain No Gain is the only idea I actually like, but the name(as mentioned by /u/9joao6 ) doesn't have a bodily mutation-like name.

NuclearThrone,3dfa8h,bycisnet,2,Thu Jul 16 01:54:49 2015 UTC,I always thought the challenge of big dog is that he covers most of the stage with projectiles and forces you to run around. During loops this is a bit more challenging because you have all kind of enemies to deal with all at once.
NuclearThrone,3dfa8h,oposdeo,2,Thu Jul 16 00:54:26 2015 UTC,What about little beyblade puppies that zoom around quicker? That way they become alternate targets without having to make the map huge or making big dog into a little dog

Crystal, played patiently, can survive a level entirely filled with bullets in a way that no other mutant can, now that Horror's beam is less effective at clearing projectiles. This makes her well-suited for pushing up to, say, 11 loops, which I think is the current record."

JW has already said they are changing crystal, not necessarily a nerf, but in the sense that you won't be able to withstand 20 BBs firing at you at once. If any character is so massively better than any other late game, of course they are going to change how the character works. There will most likely be 1 character better than others at any given time, but by the end I don't think it will be a very big difference, as we have seen in the past."

Most of the time you could end it before the boss lays a finger on you, but any hesitation could outright kill you if you're not taking cover.  Your ideas sound balanced, but I'm still sticking with Big Dog having Gamma Guts/Hammerhead during his bullet spin."

NuclearThrone,3ddu66,purehatred89,3,Wed Jul 15 14:34:32 2015 UTC,"If you are talking about the big ammo chests, then that is a bug. If you are talking about ammo drops from enemies, then that is a feature.  The way it works is that depending on the current amount of ammo you have in your weapons, the ammo drops will have a different chance to be either primary ammo or secondary ammo.  The more ammo you have in one of your weapons, the less chance that the ammo will be for that type of weapon. e.g if your shotgun is almost full, but your crossbow is almost empty, you will most likely get bolts.  if one of your weapons is a melee weapon or is full on ammo, then there is a 50% chance that it will be a random ammo type."

NuclearThrone,3db62p,Jatsala,3,Tue Jul 14 22:28:23 2015 UTC,"I found that with A, mutations like rabbit's paw, back muscle, plutonium hunger, weapon specifics largely, trigger fingers stop being quite as vital. Periodically shoot in piercing weapons (like heavy crossbow) or weapons that damage everything (cannons) or just hard hitters in general and the chain reactions kill everything.   Basically if you already have all the vital mutations, A makes you significantly less dependent on many other mutations whilst also itself being incredibly strong. This isn't even mentioning the health penalty.   If I was missing vital mutations I'd go B and hope for rhino skin if I didn't already have it."

NuclearThrone,3d7opt,Beardalelist,10,Tue Jul 14 03:59:07 2015 UTC,"In a lot of ways I feel like this whole Crystal situation has arisien entirely because of the recent change to Big Bandits. He's by far the hardest boss in l3+ now, and is a huge limiting factor for how far the other characters can get.   I've been forcing myself to take Blood Cannon way more often now, because I just can't get past the fight without it on later loops if I'm not playing Crystal."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,toxicbox,6,Tue Jul 14 04:40:15 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting point you have, I never really considered it as I normally end up with a Blood Cannon when I loop that far anyways.  Maybe if they came in waves? Or if there was a Giant Bandit that called in several Big Bandits, much like Lil' Hunter does with the IDPD? Instead of cheap spam, we'd have the ability to take out the waves as they came or, in the case of the new boss, take him out before his lackeys come in."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,TheLonelyPotato666,2,Tue Jul 14 04:52:56 2015 UTC,"I think they should all spawn together, but not on the same place."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,damimp,3,Tue Jul 14 09:50:03 2015 UTC,"That sounds reasonable. As it stands, you pretty much have to take Crystal or a blood weapon to get through that spam like /u/toxicbox mentioned. Spawning them all over the map might make it harder to locate them, but at least it would be more realistic for the other characters and just in general."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,damimp,18,Tue Jul 14 15:18:20 2015 UTC,"The problem is not that players will find a new meta to get a ridiculous score- the problem is the enormous gap between a ridiculous score with Crystal and a ridiculous score with anyone else.  The fact is that Crystal can get past challenges that other characters simply cannot get past, such as fighting 20 simultaneous Big Bandits.     We want diversity for our ridiculousness!  We want new and ever changing strategies and combinations!     Crystal's shield obviously will not be taken away, and making it useless would be silly.  But giving it a tweak certainly wouldn't kill the spirit of the game.  I mean, look at Horror.  He's still a viable character after his deserving nerf."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,BKachur,6,Tue Jul 14 04:12:46 2015 UTC,"I'm totally picking up what you're putting down, man. Crystal is insanely powerful for bullet-hell - no lie. She can cope with rougher situations than most. The shield accounts for most of the high scores. A small tweak to account for that would be fine - I just don't want another chicken situation where we loose a fun ability altogether.  Do you think it's possible that maybe Crystal's strength is around the right place and that she could possibly be a standard that other character's balancing should try to reach in the endgame? Or do you think that more mutations that don't compliment Crystal as much as it would another character are the answer? I find myself looking at Crystal, and so many of the mutations just make the most sense with her as opposed to say Fish or Y.V. Maybe the other characters should be buffed?   Edit: Missed your Horror comment. I wish I could comment on Horror, but I don't play as him so much. His nerf does sound appropriate, though, from what I could piece together.  Edit: My thing is, I'm worried about what steps they would take to nerf her, as her ability is so minimalistic already. Shield for a few seconds, few seconds of cooldown. How much more will they break it down?"
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,BKachur,5,Tue Jul 14 04:28:30 2015 UTC,"Balance is a tricky business, so it's hard to say what the best possible change is.  As it stands, I think Crystal's ability does need a rework, but the core concept doesn't have to change.   I enjoy playing as Crystal too, and have some of my best runs with her.     Another possible solution would be to introduce challenges that Crystal cannot handle as well as other characters can.  For instance, since the shield does not block explosives or energy beams, introducing new enemies that utilize such attacks may help tip the balance back in order.  A character like Fish, because of his roll, excels against enemies that target a specific location, like the Crystal Cave Crystals or Snipers, so these are obstacles that a character like him does better against.  I think new obstacles that work around the shield could overall bring Crystal into balance."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,BKachur,3,Tue Jul 14 04:40:06 2015 UTC,"I like the ideas that you bring to the table and I appreciate the input. I've never really cared for Fish, but you do make a point on how a snap reaction to an explosion lets you roll away, but as Crystal, you wouldn't have the chance. More enemies that do AoE damage like exploding plants or maybe even crossbow enemies (seeing as shielders are weak to crossbows) would be fun enemies to add to the mix.  More enemies or situations that circumvent the shield as opposed to making the shield inherently weaker sounds like a fine idea."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,Lilscribby,3,Tue Jul 14 04:50:01 2015 UTC,"While its ultimately up to the Dev's of the game, I could see their issue, although I can't break 3-4k so I don't know why I should pay for the one guy that can get 30k. From a game balancing perspective there is something not quite right with Crystal.   I was watching a stream of sleepcycles when he was fish with super plasma Cannon, gun warrant + ultra shovel and he could spawn in, shoot 3-4 SPC shots (with trigger fingers) and just swat away the bullet hell with the ultra shovel clearing levels in like 30 seconds. A dev in the stream said ""watching something so fucking broken is a nightmare for a dev trying to balance a game, but I want to leave this in just because it looks like so much fun."" I'm sure they are getting the same impression watching krinku's crystal runs. It's clear no one else can get that far at this point, the bullet hell from any of those bosses is just way to much. Again, the issue appears more widespread because of thronebutt. The average score the day krinku got 35k and squirk got 28k was only 245 so while 2 people got all time highscores for the majority of players the game is still a substantial challenge."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,2br00tal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:17:49 2015 UTC,"I was there for that SleepCycles stream. It was fantastic. JW seemed to be so conflicted, haha.  I can totally understand where the devs are coming from. On one hand, they want to keep the spirit of Nuclear Throne - a bullet-hell that is challenging through and through. In doing that, though, they have to decide whether or not to remove elements that, although fun for the player, the devs see as broken or imbalanced. I'm sure that the devs will do their best to keep the community in mind before making any game changing decisions, but only time will tell unless they have a announcement.  Your main comment is where I'm coming from. I don't see why any of us, nearly 5k people on the subreddit alone at this point, should pay for the actions of a small group of players, literally just those in the top 5, if that."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,Thelemonish,3,Tue Jul 14 07:15:54 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to fix the issue, without making a clear nerf to the character is just to create a short cooldown after crystal pops out of her(his?) shield before before she can pop back inside. I always felt that the ability to pop in and out of the sheild within 1/2 a second of popping out was a little to powerful. This way, it ill prevent the situation of players literally walking through bullet hell just popping in and out of the shield, and I think won't be too detrimental to the character, although it will make her even more defensive than she already is. Krinku should not have been able to tank the bullet hell the way he did, but I don't think the special ability needs a complete rework, just enough to prevent permanently staying in crystal mode."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,TheLonelyPotato666,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:28:00 2015 UTC,"I agree that this is the most direct and simple solution. /u/SwordSaint892 made a similar suggestion a bit earlier, calling for a longer cooldown and potential short up-time. Not to mention /u/InvalidGnome claims that the hitbox delay allows for an infinite shield effect as well.  Should they tweak the active to have a longer cooldown, I'd be fine with it. I rarely walk into the center and hold down right click, despite saying that in the Biweekly Rage Post a few weeks back. It's a more realistic approach to the shield, I feel, and would put an emphasis on the defensive gameplay.  Again, I hope that the devs don't go off the deep end with it. I could throw numbers out there all day long for what I think is fair for timings, but many may dismiss that. So, as a player, I'll say that the cool-down shouldn't feel much longer than the ability. If the shield is down for the amount of time it can stay up, that's plenty enough to nerf it if the devs have to, if not more than enough."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,Fblthp_is_god,3,Tue Jul 14 07:39:13 2015 UTC,"If the shield is down for the amount of time it can stay up, that's plenty enough to nerf it if the devs have to, if not more than enough.   I hope its not this. That is taking it way to far and is a substantial nerf. I think just a second between shields or possible even reducing the size of the sheild would be sufficient (like when crystal shields it's actually extends out a block in all directions)"
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,InvalidGnome,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:14:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my thoughts exactly. That's why I said ""Plenty enough."" I hope they do something closer to an additional second if they do feel that they have to nerf it, but I still am holding out hope that Crystal will stay the same old Crystal, more or less.  This thread has brought some valuable information to my eyes about Crystal's shield and some bugs associated with it. Of course, I want Crystal to stay the same at the end of the day, but I accept that tweaks will be made. And that's what I hope they are - tweaks, not reworks."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,SwordSaint892,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:33:53 2015 UTC,"What if, instead of being able to shield for a period of time, she can only take a certain number of bullets (or a certain dmg) before losing it? That would make a lot of sense, and give it a bit of a nerf without making it too bad (the amount of damage could be on the order of 20)"
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,Lilscribby,3,Thu Jul 16 13:11:01 2015 UTC,"I'm with you OP, I don't feel Crystal should be changed for the worse. Crystal excels where others do not: with Defense. Crystal is very defensive in her characteristics, given the +2 base health with a +6 ultra mutation. And with that, building to the strengths of that character you can do well in that way.  I believe that if you play to a character's strengths and play to them well, you get far. Of course, sheer skill and a feel for the game is a big part of how far people can get on a run. When those select few people get to those insane lengths of the game with certain characters, they know exactly how to utilize that character's strengths.   Eventually there will be people out there who go beyond the recent scores with different characters."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,Lilscribby,2,Tue Jul 14 06:11:15 2015 UTC,"I look forward to the day that we have someone break the 30k marker with a Eyes run or a Melting run. Maybe then some of the more nerf-happy members of the community will take a step back and say, ""Hey, these guys are actually really good. Let's not just automatically attribute it to the character they play.""  I get fairly far with Crystal because I only play Crystal and Melting. I focus on those skills that come with them, and it rewards me well. These players have just taken it one step further.  I appreciate your view on the matter. You managed to fit a strong point into a concise space, a point that many overlook."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,micahbrown,0,Tue Jul 14 07:20:05 2015 UTC,"It is probably impossible to get a score of 30k with any character other than Crystal, and you would have known that if you had watched the run of Krinku or squerc1."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,MajorStupidity11,3,Wed Jul 15 18:55:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe per kill a bar should charge up and using the shield makes the bar go down. This wouldn' really matter pre-loop since you don't have to use it that much, but you wouldn't be able to keep using it non stop like Krinku did for the 35k run.  Another idea is to make enemies that die because of reflected bullets from Crystal's shield not count as kills. You would have to do at least one damage to an enemy with one of your two weapons to make it count as a kill. This way the shield would only be used defensively."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,TushieCushie,2,Tue Jul 14 10:00:15 2015 UTC,"Those are two very creative and down to earth ideas. Thanks for the input. I feel that more actives based on dynamic situations have a lot to offer for this game in terms of meta.  Seeing as it could be a kill based-charge, I could realistically see me save it for bosses or dire straits. I wonder how Crown of Blood would work though. At some point, I feel that you'd be bringing in more kills than the meter requires and that you would essentially nullify the necessity of the meter. On most runs I end up with some form of cannon and trigger fingers. Would we end up with a Bloodlust situation where you can take as much damage as you please for several seconds, but you can keep activating it due to the sheer number of kills? The idea is still an interesting thought, and brings more focus to getting ammo mutations in the long run, as getting more kills would result in better shielding capabilities.  This is probably the most straight-forward idea I've seen on here. I'm surprised I haven't seen it yet. If others have mentioned it, forgive me - I just crawled out of bed. We had the change a few updates ago with the resurrected fish. I don't recall exactly what it was, but it more or less stopped people from farming them. This change would put a focus on using the shield for defense instead of offense. Again, we would still be able to put up with the insane Big Bandit fights, but the focus there is mostly survival. I am curious, though, how many of the 35k kills were due to the shield. If we had some way to tell, it could go a long way for the devs in this regard. On one hand, that might knock off several thousand, and in the other, the amount might be negligible.  All in all very solid ideas."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,Cadllmn,2,Tue Jul 14 15:29:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, when i watched the big bandit gif, i saw that the shield wasn't on cool down. I think that needs to fix so the shield actually works properly with cool down first so that this kind of thing doesn't happen where it can literally tank 20+ big bandits."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,lipman19,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:15:04 2015 UTC,"I can understand that. The cooldown is very short. Maybe a longer cool-down? Or a cool-down proportionate to how long you used it before? That would let you tank through an entire wave of Big Bandits, but you wouldn't be able to use it for a time after."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,lipman19,3,Tue Jul 14 05:25:20 2015 UTC,"It's mainly the fact that the hitbox stays out longer than the animation itself, making the shield, if timed correctly, almost basically always up."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,the8cell,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:14:15 2015 UTC,"See, I did not know that. There are many occasions where I felt I should've taken damage a few loops in, and the bullets just seemed to melt off me. Maybe if they corrected the hitbox issue that would be a good start for the balancing. That would probably make the player's run much tougher from that small fix right there."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,Galenor,2,Tue Jul 14 07:27:13 2015 UTC,"I remember reading awhile ago on the wiki that it has been intended for a long time for Crystal's shield to not be as easy mode broken defense as it is.    Reducing how much time it can be up and creating a much larger cool down between activation would be some pretty good solutions.    Could even treat the shield kinda like Horror beam and make it cost rads either over time or per attack that it blocks. That could be interesting too, but Crystal doesn't fit the whole ""rad burning"" theme like glowing green Horror does."
NuclearThrone,3d7opt,greatzimkogway,2,Tue Jul 14 06:29:51 2015 UTC,"That's a good suggestion, and thanks for throwing that info from the wiki in there. I'll be sure to check that later - I mostly use it for looking up mutations.  I think that if they did go with a change, then your first idea is the most likely change they'd make.   I can respect the validity of the shield costing rads to use, but I don't think it would fit Ultra A or the default shield. I think that Ultra B should use rads as you move while shielded. It would be a pretty decent thing to consider, but the rate at which the rads are consumed would be tricky to find a middle-ground for, lots of tweaking to come.  I think that your idea definitely deserves some attention by the crew. Simple, but elegant."

Its really great to have people coming back to the game, and especially people who are this enthusiastic!   (You still get the same amount of weapons if you skip the first crate, so it normally is better to take it first but it doesn't matter a ton because the weapons will be better in the next crate)"
NuclearThrone,3d9ywo,ruler14222,5,Tue Jul 14 17:31:03 2015 UTC,"It's not that one is better over another, big chests are a game mechanic that is supposed to prevent you just mindlessly opening every weapon chest.  Take a small chest when you are not satisfied with your current weapons, and skip them if your build is ok at the moment. That's it."
NuclearThrone,3d9ywo,PixelLeaf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:35:04 2015 UTC,"In general, taking all weapon chests won't give you more or less weapons than waiting for a big one.  The key difference is if you like what you already have or not.  One reason to wait for a big weapon chest is that since better weapons drop at higher levels, the bigger weapon chest has the ability to drop better weapons than the chests before it.  It's also a lot like taking a patience- if you don't need to swap weapons yet due to having good weapons and a lot of ammo, then getting a big weapon chest later when you might potentially be low on ammo can be a huge help.  In summary, don't worry about getting a big weapon chest all the time, just when you feel like you can handle less weapon drops for a bit for a chance to get ahead of the weapon curve."

NuclearThrone,3d9ywo,xDishonored,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:25:50 2015 UTC,"Skipping a chest will give you a 25% chance to have a large chest at the beginning of the level. This bonus stacks up to 4 times in which you will get a Big Weapons Chest GUARANTEED. 3 Skipped chests means there is a 25% chance to not have a BWC.  Btw, opening a chest when you have already skipped 2 does not reset the bonus you get."

NuclearThrone,3d5i7d,IntentionalMisnomer,5,Mon Jul 13 18:47:59 2015 UTC,I think this is the best idea. When the shield breaks you can bring it up again almost immediately. This makes it so Crystal can survive those 20+ Big Bandits when every other character gets slaughtered

NuclearThrone,3d5i7d,Thelemonish,6,Mon Jul 13 18:42:59 2015 UTC,"Too many mobs on screen would instantaneously destroy the shield.

I'm just gonna keep saying that both Crystal and Plant share the same problem as Slow-mo chicken."
NuclearThrone,3d5i7d,stevaloo,4,Mon Jul 13 18:34:26 2015 UTC,Crystal's shield is the ultimate nerf by itself IMO. Crystal's shield can easily lead a novice player into a false sense of invincibility which will temp them to do dumb things that they'd not try with a character that couldn't shield.

It even resembles those in fighting games with its longer ending lag.   I'd say if that aspect of the active is to be nerfed, the end lag should be made even longer. Meaning if you're under fire by 10 Big Bandits, you can shield immediately and be safe, but can't unshield and reshield straight away without getting hit. That unshielding moment is where you should be vulnerable."

NuclearThrone,3d2b97,Gammer001,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:59:56 2015 UTC,0 loops - red 1 loop - green 2 loops - cyan 3 loops - blue 4 loops - purple    and then it starts over from red.

NuclearThrone,3cz107,_Dio,3,Sun Jul 12 02:38:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely a shame about Plant, but I think it's a pretty fair nerf. I think the balancing in this update is by and large some good stuff. (Also, shouldn't this post say Update #81 instead of #82?)"
NuclearThrone,3cz107,Chakyl,5,Sun Jul 12 02:50:25 2015 UTC,"I still think they should have switched his throne butt for ultra A. I mean, even now I'm not sure if I'm going to stop taking B every time."
NuclearThrone,3cz107,_Dio,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:02:46 2015 UTC,"I hadn't thought of that, actually. That's an interesting thought; I've generally found the ultra A to be pretty underwhelming as well.

I don't think this is ""completely fair"" at all."
NuclearThrone,3cz107,toxicbox,6,Mon Jul 13 10:25:11 2015 UTC,"Looks like Plant took some pretty hefty nerfs this week.  Anyone know what flame weapons being more ""fuel efficient"" means? I can't play right now and it's sort of an ambiguous statement. Does this mean that the flame cannon uses less ammo again?  Glad Lil' hunter took another nerf. The shielders he spawned were so annoying.   I like that Forettress got a buff, Crystal can now get up to 20 hp! Still don't know if I'll take it over Juggernaut though.  I think the biggest change this week was the less hp drops on further loops. I'm hoping this will make everyone's runs shorter, because playing for over an hour on a run where you loop a few times can get tiring. I think we might also see people prioritizing bloodlust more, not that it already wasn't a great late game mutation."

NuclearThrone,3cyyfb,Puzzlesque,18,Sun Jul 12 01:36:07 2015 UTC,Plant Throne Butt now kills enemy under 30% instead of 40%.    Confirmed worst update.
NuclearThrone,3cyyfb,UnbiasedLactoseMotel,6,Sun Jul 12 02:16:06 2015 UTC,"Update #151 - Plant's Throne Butt now kills Plant under 50%. Don't ask how that's even possible, or we'll make it 60%.  But seriously, was this even needed? I can get 50% to 40% as a compromise, but doesn't this negate the benefit of getting Throne Butt?"
NuclearThrone,3cyyfb,AbsoluTeField,9,Sun Jul 12 02:18:41 2015 UTC,"negate   How so? It certainly seems to be worse than scarier face now, which sucks, but I imagine it's still a worthwhile mutation on its own.  I wish they'd just switch around the throne butt and the trapper ultra. Having a bigger snare for an ultra is pretty underwhelming, but giving it the ability to kill enemies under 40% hp actually changes how you play a lot. As well, it contrasts with the killer ultra really well, since the saplings are better against hordes of enemies, while the current throne butt is most effective against high-hp single targets, like bosses."
NuclearThrone,3cyyfb,Puzzlesque,4,Sun Jul 12 02:33:57 2015 UTC,"Now that you mention Scarier Face, didn't they adjust how Scarier Face affects enemy HP to make Plant's Throne Butt less effective as a combo? Or maybe it was the other way around?  Either way, my gripe is that Throne Butt tends to be a mutation that adds a noticeable personal benefit - not as much as an Ultra, but maybe enough to consider taking it over ""essential"" mutations. 40% worked well enough for Plant before, but this new update and other adjustments like the Scarier Face one makes it even less appealing. It's not even a necessary mutation to me right now (nice, but not so badly needed), and this will personally make me skip over it.  And now I'm wondering if 30% is the absolute lowest it will go. I don't even want to think about 20%."
NuclearThrone,3cyyfb,AbsoluTeField,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:52:19 2015 UTC,"I think they changed it such that scarier face actually lowers their total health, instead of just dealing damage. This means the two mutations now combine multiplicatively, which results in enemies having 4/5 * 3/5 = 12/25 as much health. Before, it resulted in them having 1 - 1/5 - 2/5 = 2/5 as much health.  Of course, those calculations are using the old value for plant's throne butt, which, yeah, didn't really need a nerf."

NuclearThrone,3ct5sa,ledraps,3,Sat Jul 11 13:09:25 2015 UTC,"I'd be inclined to agree with you. However, sometimes there are those awkward moment when your melee weapon just doesn't do enough damage, and you need to drop it for a  more balanced gun layout. I've tried wrenching to death snow bots, doesn't work that well."
NuclearThrone,3ct5sa,IamSpaghettiBox,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:56:21 2015 UTC,Ya I've been stuck with 0 ammo and only a chicken sword against snowbots and barely made it out (only to instantly die on the next level) so a gun just in case is always helpful
NuclearThrone,3ct5sa,SwordSaint892,3,Fri Jul 10 16:00:01 2015 UTC,"Melee weapons are really useful, especially for the bullet reflect/negation and the wall tricks like you mentioned; but some of them do really rely on specific mutations the longer you have them: Scarier Face for Wrench, still scales down hard right after 3-3; Scarier Face + Trigger Fingers (+ Long Arms) for Shovel, still really bad in the Palace loop 1; Trigger Fingers for Sledgehammer, still really bad in the Palace loop 1; Laser Brain for Energy Sword; Jackhammer, can be useful for awhile, but it costs lots of ammo and is pretty awkward; Ultra Shovel is godlike regardless of loadout/character.    Try not to pigeon-hole yourself into ""I NEED to have 1 melee weapon at all times!"" though.    I used to heavily bank on melee weapons (partially because I use a gamepad and my aim was garbage), but you really miss out on some good combinations and dps opportunities. Very commonly something like 2 good bolt weapons will be the best loadout for an extended period of time.    Melee weapons can be super good, but you do hold yourself back by relying on always having to have one, and when you play without them you'll feel more nervous because you won't be used to not having the protection they offer.    (To be fair, Bullet weapons mostly all rely on eventually having 2 of the 3 mutations: Scarier Face/Back Muscle/Recycle Gland; just because of how much ammo they consume, so weapons ""requiring"" specific mutations isn't that uncommon.)"
NuclearThrone,3ct5sa,DerpyDoseGamez,2,Fri Jul 10 20:04:03 2015 UTC,ultra shovel? eli5
NuclearThrone,3ct5sa,sociodouble,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:11:19 2015 UTC,given that I got to big dog on loop with steroids with only double wrench and crown of love melee is quite effective. It really does wreck most bosses if you can have a continuos stream of projectile destroying attacks however you should know that melee does not work in the crystal caves on loop.

NuclearThrone,3ct5sa,Galenor,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:27:00 2015 UTC,"I find that melee weapons are really nice to have, if they're on offer. My favourites are usually Shovel/Wrench for anything under Zone 4, and Energy Sword/Energy Hammer for pretty much any zone.  Melee weapons really help my survivability in Zones 2, 4, and 5. I really suck against enemies that rush at you to inflict contact damage, so melee weapons are a godsend.  Also, I've been noticing melee weapon's usage vs. Lil' Hunter. Stand by the shadow, and time the melee attack just right so that it cuts through the flames he emits. Then go ham on him, cutting through his bullets until he's dead."

Ranged burst damage is pretty useful against a lot of enemies, particularly Big Bandit Squad, Hyper Crystal, and Dog Guardians.

I went to Y.V.'s Crib, didn't get any Ultra Weapons (last time this happened to me I did though, so IDK why it didn't give them to me this time...), and then it sent me all the way back to Loop 0 3-3. I went through and fought through all of Loop 0 again before dying to the throne and getting a score of 809 and a difficulty of 26.    TL;DR: Took Y.V.'s ultra before I beat the throne and then got to go through all of loop 0 again."
NuclearThrone,3cra3y,damimp,4,Fri Jul 10 03:35:35 2015 UTC,"You got no ultra weapons because they only drop at a certain difficulty level, ordinarily loop 1 sewers.  Since you went to the crib at what would be before loop 0 throne fight, they had no chance of spawning.  The pizza sewers and multiple crown vault visits increase difficulty level, which might explain how you got ultra weapons that early before."

NuclearThrone,3cqgiw,moopdog,6,Thu Jul 9 23:18:17 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, you can usually pick your battlefield. Use those first ten seconds before he shows up to clear out a few enemies and make sure you aren't caught in a corner or enclosed space. That, and make sure you have some sort of high-damage, unavoidable weapon (Heavy Cross + Bolt Marrow works well; so do the various sluggers and double shotguns). Take him out fast. If you drag it out, you will die."

NuclearThrone,3cqgiw,Sir_Magic_Toast,2,Thu Jul 9 23:39:52 2015 UTC,"I've found that luring him into making his first landing inside a small enclosed space with only one exit can work well.   When you spawn in one of those little 'offshoot' areas leading into a wider space, first clear out the outside space, then head back to the spawn area. Wait until you hear Little Hunter yell and see his shadow appear in the spawn area. At that point, he's committed - so bail and wait on the other side of the entrance ready to hit him through the gap. His spread-shot will mostly hit the walls. If you've got a high-damage weapon, you can often nail him in one jump here."

I think people see ""prevent death once"" and go ""oh my gooooooooooooooood"" without considering that it's not going to be terribly helpful in most situations* that would cause your death.  *(I will say however that it might be more helpful when playing rogue since the blast armour would clear out any incoming bullets at the same time and also might actually be practical against melee enemies with the new cooldown between when they can hit you.)"

NuclearThrone,3crni5,sociodouble,12,Fri Jul 10 05:42:21 2015 UTC,"I can recall a similar argument on my stream about this before so let me have it recorded here. I've said Krinku is better than me. He had to shift his priorities for a period prevented him from playing for some time which is when I pretty much took over. He could have overtaken me a while ago in terms of rank because I'm now in the same boat he was in when I got top. I'm expecting to fall off of top by the end of the month at the latest. It's been fun and I enjoyed the ride.   As far as people saying I'm the best, that's public opinion and something I have no control over. I always like to show other good nuclear throne players and even those who may just be trying to get their first loop. I'm not really one to worry about whose the best or not because I was also a person who had difficulties looping, plus I'm not a very competitive person in general. The community's been good to me and all the love given to me I try to give back."

This was just me venting my annoyance at people being ignorant. You are an amazing player and I think it is really inspiring that you and some of the other great players out there are able to do so well at the game. Keep up the great work.

NuclearThrone,3crni5,zblackboxz,3,Fri Jul 10 08:50:47 2015 UTC,"It's completely opinionated, if people think that the best player is Azite for the most kills, let them. If you think it's Krinku for the best average score, that's fine. I personally don't care, and guessing from all the downvotes, others would probably agree."
NuclearThrone,3crni5,Akosss,2,Fri Jul 10 11:38:27 2015 UTC,"This is great and stuff, but you are incorrectly basing your judgement on ""average scores."" Pretty much everyone in the world can loop as many times as they like, so a true test of skill is this: Who can go the farthest with their eyes closed while reciting the alphabet backwards.  I haven't done this yet myself. But now that I've thought of it I'm going to do it as soon as I get home from work so that I can be the official best Nuclear Throne player."
NuclearThrone,3crni5,SwordSaint892,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:24:36 2015 UTC,You are absolutely right. Thank you for opening my eyes to how silly I have been. This truly is the the only reasonable and true way to test people's skill.
NuclearThrone,3crni5,Akosss,4,Fri Jul 10 21:17:17 2015 UTC,"Until we knew so... There is NO best in Nuclear Throne. Skills? Skills. Who cares about who looped 10 or something similiar i don't know times and killed like a billion enemies? Yeah that's impressive, but still: all that counts as what we really think of ourselves imo."
NuclearThrone,3crni5,stevaloo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:38:46 2015 UTC,"As cute as the sentiment is, if one was to judge who the strongest player was in Nuclear Throne, Average Daily score is the most fair way to do it, because it doesn't take points away from the players that have less chance to actually do the Daily.

Yaaay we can now host our mod again! Nuclear Throne: Community Remix is a mod that contains over 140 new, completely community-designed weapons, 6 new mutations, 2 new characters, a new IDPD, 2 new types of chests (one of them only post-loop), and loads of other little things, like a B button for Chicken and a moni trail for YV! If you've seen SleepCycles' streams, you're still only familiar with about 8% of the content in this mod.  (and yes, most (hopefully all) bugs and crashes have been fixed)  And of course, thanks to /u/BioOnPC /u/yyyfa /u/A_BEAUTIFUL_PONY /u/NotYourSagittarius /u/Pancakeflippers & everyone in the stream chat for contributing to the mod's assets!"

NuclearThrone,3cnyl7,StrangeInsight,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:43:53 2015 UTC,charging damage is not melee damage. It's contact damage.
NuclearThrone,3cnyl7,Valliac,3,Fri Jul 10 05:43:11 2015 UTC,Explosions and Melee will ruin crystal. I've had Big Bandit steamroll me on a fear-shield before.  Same with having a car thrown in my direction and killing me.

NuclearThrone,3cnyl7,Dancing_Anatolia,0,Thu Jul 9 20:20:17 2015 UTC,I believe that only assassins use a melee attack. I know that explosions deal damage but most chargers such as big bandit and snow bots do contact damage not melee. You have probably been killed by big dog while shielding because you shielded too late and he was already inside the shield. I know you can shield against him because I have done it.  edit: I have checked the wiki which is usually quite reliable and they also say that melee damage is unique to assassins.

NuclearThrone,3cizp4,oldbob12,7,Wed Jul 8 11:13:24 2015 UTC,"Developers would make their mods, then put all the assets and .exe file in a single .zip file.  Then, mods can be loaded and unloaded through this program, simply by pressing a button.   So for example, for you to distribute the Nuclear Throne Community Remix, you'd simply create a .zip file, and add in these files:  nuclearthrone.exe  resources.text - This will hold a list of all files to extract.  Any other extra assets.  Then the user would just put the .zip into their defined mods directory, and press a button. Then BAM! The mod would be loaded into their Nuclear Throne install directory, as long as they have the [mod] branch installed.  Sorry if it's a poor explaination, I'm super tired."

NuclearThrone,3cj4wv,Clauschauss,7,Wed Jul 8 09:00:20 2015 UTC,It does say in big letters it's very wip soo....
NuclearThrone,3cj4wv,Ontrevant,3,Wed Jul 8 10:49:38 2015 UTC,"I agree. not a big fan of the menu. I preferred the way the game just threw you to the character select menu.  but, it is a WIP, and I am sure it'll improve."
NuclearThrone,3cj4wv,wizzahd,2,Wed Jul 8 15:26:10 2015 UTC,"I'm actually really encouraged by this new menu - it's obviously in the very early phases, but it makes me optimistic for a more tweakable game, with things like display options and rebindable keys/buttons!"
NuclearThrone,3cj4wv,Astrimedes,2,Wed Jul 8 16:35:43 2015 UTC,"I think they could have done it differently, though. More customization options are always great, but I think they could have easily fit in the old options menu (maybe have the old option menu bring up the new one) so the character selection screen remains the main menu screen.  Being able to jump right into a game and then ragequit the fuck out immediately was one of the great things about NT, and now it's gone because of the menu."
NuclearThrone,3cj4wv,Dirst,2,Wed Jul 8 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"They could do a couple simple things to preserve most of that functionality though:   The game remembers the last character you picked, and every time you get to Character Select, your cursor starts on that last character As /u/stringerdell here suggests, on the death screen you could have a particular button that immediately quits to desktop   So, start game, press Start to get to Character Select, press Start again (without having to select if you want the same character as last time), and you're in the game.  Then, you die, press Back (or whatever) and then the game exits.  I think it's kind of disconcerting to see so many playtesters hating on this new menu screen - we can't just like things because that's how they already are - the game isn't done!  They're trying to do a good job of polishing this game, so let them do it!  I want rebindable controls and real menu options!  Shut up everyone who discourages this stuff!  No offense intended, but I think a lot of us are losing sight of what the purpose of Early Access is... and I worry that will rub off on Vlambeer and they will too.."

NuclearThrone,3cjfuu,nuclear__throwaway,8,Wed Jul 8 11:29:49 2015 UTC,"In general, you can try playing more patiently. Take your time and don't rush into big open areas. I know the ammo/rads can be tempting. As you play more, your reflexes will get better and you'll stop making as many stupid mistakes (Bumping into a bullet here and there, letting a rat bump into you in the sewers) and you'll have more health for anything that might be unfair.  If you're spawned in a big open area (your spawns should be relatively safe, by the way) pick a direction and make a mad dash. You have a few moments before everything starts pouring bullet hell on you.   When you get to 5-3, you have a little time to clear out a zone to fight Lil' Hunter in. When he jumps in the air, he usually tries to land on you - use this to your advantage and look for a little dark spot on the ground (that's where he'll land). Beyond that, just pray to God that he'll shoot his bouncy bullets more than his death-bullets.   If you beat Lil' Hunter, then congratulations! You've defeated the most difficult boss in the game!"
NuclearThrone,3cjfuu,zblackboxz,7,Wed Jul 8 12:41:11 2015 UTC,"Lil Hunter doesn't appear immediately. Use this time to clear out as many normal enemies you possibly can. When the fucker does show up, unload your most powerful weapons into him. Make sure you also bring a spammable weapon to ensure you can land a hit, and to clear out the IDPD agents he spawns. When Lil Hunter starts spamming shots, take cover and fire upon him with your strongest weapon when you see an opening. Keep this up until you hear the satisfying sound of his screaming. Once that happens, the second hardest boss in the game has died.  If you play as Y.V, bring a super crossbow and hope Lil Hunter spawns near you. Right click at him once and he dies.  As for spawning in open areas, locate the nearest area in which you can take cover, and immediately run for it and pick off the enemies. If you need to run out in the open to get some rads, resist the urge to do so until it's safe enough for you to get them all without getting hit.  On the topic of golden weapons, if you hold one when you enter a level ending portal, you'll be able to make the character you used to  find the weapon start with that weapon (for instance, if you find a golden shotgun as Fish, you can start with the gold shotgun as Fish, but not as anyone else unless you find the weapon with them). To do so, click on the character as if you're going to select them. Then, click the revolver icon to open the loadout menu. You can select the golden weapon from there, as well as any crowns you want to start with, and the character's B skin.  Finally, keep playing the game. It takes a lot more than 20 hours to master the game mechanics, which are quite complicated. If you get the opportunity, try to hold off on taking crowns until you're more experienced. They all come with downsides, some more severe than others. If dodging is hard for you, try using Eyes with Throne Butt and Euphoria. This makes bullets extremely easy to dodge as long as you hold right click to repel them. Alternatively, play as Crystal and shield whenever you see a lot of bullets headed your way."
NuclearThrone,3cjfuu,Exoskeletal65,6,Wed Jul 8 14:28:49 2015 UTC,"it's complete bullshit  plz rami, add this loading screen tip"
NuclearThrone,3cjfuu,FMarkassa,2,Wed Jul 8 16:46:12 2015 UTC,"Focus on dodging incoming stuff above all else. And like the other guy said playing patiently is a good habit to get into.   Theres no shame at all in struggling, NT is an insanely hard game. I killed the throne maybe 2 or 3 times in my first 40 hours, something just clicks eventually and now at 60 hours played I can loop about once every 5 deaths.  For lil hunter bring a big ass weapon like a super slugger, run up to him as he lands and hit him hard. Jackhammer is also useful for killing him with low risk to yourself."

They're also usually slightly better than the non-golden versions. Additionally, taking levels at a slow pace and thoroughly thinking through what mutations you should take and how you should play around your build will help you make the most of your mutations, as well as letting you get enemy patterns down."
NuclearThrone,3cjfuu,CryoCrisis,5,Wed Jul 8 11:33:44 2015 UTC,You actually have to pass through a portal holding a golden weapon now for it to register.

Are these in later levels?"
NuclearThrone,3cjfuu,CryoCrisis,2,Wed Jul 8 11:44:23 2015 UTC,"You get golden weapons either from Y.V's mansion (hit the gold-lined car in 3-1 with a screwdriver) or during looping. For bad level generation, consider taking Hammerhead, or just prepare for the worst."
NuclearThrone,3cjfuu,Clauschauss,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"You get golden weapons by going to yv's mansion. To do this, you must find a screwdriver, and attack a car in level 3-1. The car you're looking for is red with a gold trim. When you press e on this car, a portal will spawn, killing everything in the level. This portal brings you to the mansion, which is a relatively tough level. Inside the mansion, you'll find a slot machine looking thing. This functions as a weapon chest, spawning a random golden weapon. Take this through the portal, and you'll be able to select it next time you start that character. Alternatively, golden weapons can drop randomly on loops, but you mentioned you haven't gotten that far yet."

NuclearThrone,3ckmqu,TheLonelyPotato666,4,Wed Jul 8 17:33:32 2015 UTC,"3-3 is usually a very open level. Big Dog won't wake up immediately, though. He only wakes up if he takes damage or if you walk too close. Try to clear out the other enemies on the level before he wakes up. Make assassins and snipers your main priority.  There's definitely an element of luck to the game, but with enough practice, you'll be able to handle terrible spawns."

NuclearThrone,3ckmqu,madcontender,3,Wed Jul 8 23:47:21 2015 UTC,"At this point in the game's development, It's 60/40 strategy/luck.

NuclearThrone,3ckmqu,the8cell,2,Wed Jul 8 23:47:55 2015 UTC,"If you made it to 3-3 after 3 days of playing, you're actually pretty good IMO.   But it's really common to believe that the game is mainly luck-based when you first start playing, because it seems that way. Skill does play a lot in being good though. I'd try watching some streams from some of the better players and seeing what they do. That helped me get to that ""ah!"" moment. I won't say that the game is perfect now because Vlambeer needs to still do a lot of balancing though."

NuclearThrone,3ci1kq,ChainOfDeath,2,Wed Jul 8 01:53:22 2015 UTC,well I have no clue what PH is (please don't use acronyms). But throne butt seems to be the way the devs want it. It used to be 50% not 40% but they nerfed it a while ago and have left it alone since.  The reason you might be finding plant easier is that the extra speed makes dodging easier and the snare makes it possible to slow down if you get swarmed.   Plant is a very good character for a particular play style o he might just be the right character for you. You should also try to use other characters so you can get better in all situations.

NuclearThrone,3cholr,sociodouble,2,Wed Jul 8 02:03:47 2015 UTC,honestly the most important mutations while looping are trigger finger plutonium hunger and scarier face. these let you kill things as quickly as possible and get your drops without putting yourself in danger. It doesn't matter if rabbit paw is giving you all the drops in the world if a bunch of enemies are tanking damage while sitting on top of them.

NuclearThrone,3cf0hs,Blue_Link13,-2,Tue Jul 7 22:32:05 2015 UTC,is looping exactly what it says on the tin? Beat all the levels and repeat? As in the way that Risk fo Rain does it?

NuclearThrone,3cf0hs,2dumb5math,2,Tue Jul 7 14:18:36 2015 UTC,Some people don't count that as a true loop. You haven't beaten the Throne's final form. Personal opinion I guess.

NuclearThrone,3cb2gs,DusttoAshes,2,Mon Jul 6 20:25:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you could also give away modded copies outside of steam, which would make it bigger since we would now have the steam copies AND the modded copies m8."

NuclearThrone,3cb2gs,DusttoAshes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:43:40 2015 UTC,"Because it takes more time to upload, it makes what you are doing illegal (so a copyright claim can take all the files you hosted down), and it is pointless since the pirated versions are already available to everyone."
NuclearThrone,3cb2gs,minichibis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:21:34 2015 UTC,"the point is... most people wouldnt know where to throw the modded files, so uploading the whole game (modded) would be easier.. rami is just asking to us avoid this, uploading only the files and not the game"

NuclearThrone,3ceni9,Nommiin,3,Tue Jul 7 11:23:28 2015 UTC,"Technically, they didn't have to, but the way GameMaker works makes it so if you don't set it to 60 frames right from the getgo, you'll have to later change ALL the time-related variable in your game, or else it'll run at double speed.

NuclearThrone,3ceni9,yyyfa,0,Tue Jul 7 20:21:49 2015 UTC,"That's just like, your opinion man. Thing is, it probably wouldn't be that bad to go into game maker and change all the delta timing to get everything to run normal speed on a higher framerate. However, It would take a lot of time for little gain. I think the framerate is fine, so do a lot of other people.

NuclearThrone,3ceni9,Ethan_the_Lion,2,Tue Jul 7 19:54:48 2015 UTC,"The game would need to be reworked from the ground up to run at 60, since the engine it uses calculate motion on a pet frame basis  They probably went for it because it was the default of the game creation program and the game started as a game jam prototype."

NuclearThrone,3cbyrd,Chainguns,8,Mon Jul 6 19:00:18 2015 UTC,"Well, you know, it's only like my opinion, man. Games don't need menus that slow you down from the action!"
NuclearThrone,3cbyrd,Psychopath12,11,Mon Jul 6 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"Having a separate title splash and main menu is important for determining which controller is going to be deemed Player 1. This will become more important when co-op is finalized, but it'll also make it easier for a singular player to more-easily ""tell"" the game which control setup (keyboard or controller) they are using by using any input at the splash screen to confirm.  Menus are important because it gives the game ample opportunity to properly initialize variables that the player does not directly see or interact with. It's not just so the game looks pretty or professional, there are under-the-hood things that need to be properly accounted for.  Yes, the game was functional in its previous iterations, but it was extremely sloppy and frankly a bit unintuitive."
NuclearThrone,3cbyrd,HacksawUnit,4,Mon Jul 6 19:19:34 2015 UTC,"well, like I said, I thought it had a ""cool"" factor in it. that's about it"

NuclearThrone,3cc0ky,zanderthedestroyer,7,Mon Jul 6 19:03:48 2015 UTC,"/r/Nuclearthrone User   Backstory   Before the apocalypse he was submitting a text post to /r/Nuclearthrone describing the awesome idea he had for a new playable character for Nuclear Throne, after the apocalypse he become one with his computer, When he heard about the throne he couldn't give a fuck becouse he already gave them all to Nuclear Throne, so instead of starting his journey he just lurked around the campfire playing with himself (He's half a computer now, so he's litterally playing with himself, no masturbation jokes), He eventually suicided when he lost against Lil' Hunter/a Shielder for the hundredth time.   Appearance   He looks like a computer with acne and thick skin  glasses.   Passive   He gets more drops and he's immune to toxic gas and he can choose other characters passives/actives to use in addition to his own and he starts with his awesome starting weapon that deals x damage, x is determined by how overpowered you want him to be and by how much you like to post screens of loop death screens. But it's balanced becouse his starting weapon is cursed.   Active   He does a melee attack less powerful than the wrench and more powerful than the chicken sword that covers 360° degrees he also becomes the last enemy he killed and spawns the next enemy that he kills, but it's not overpowered becouse he can't spawn/copy bosses.   Throne Butt   Now he can spawn/copy bosses and all current and future cursed weapons are now uncursed.   Ultras   A:  You can choose the loop you're currently in and you can take the ultra B.  B:  You can choose how many enemies you've killed and you can take the ultra A.   ART, ART, ART   It's very WIP   Starting Weapon   He starts with a rusty revolver and you can't take weapons  Edit: Ok, I balanced the starting weapon, how is it now?   Backstory no wait i already did that Playstyle no wait i already did this too No wait i didn't   You click his icon and then click his icon again and you can play, but before you have to start the game and click play on the menu.  Let me know if this character is good, I really hope he makes it in the game xD, some feedback from vlambeer would be good too thanks everyone it's my first idea and it's very really work in progress but i think it should be good becouse he has all the abilities of the other characters. K thx bye."

NuclearThrone,3cc0ky,moopdog,3,Mon Jul 6 23:47:15 2015 UTC,"And now, a character suggestion i made on the last thread that nobody noticed or gave a shit about because the thread died down by that point.  Somewhat incomplete mutant idea.  Character name: Fireman  Appearance: Bald human male with a burnt face, surgical mask and flame retardant suit.   B Skin: Full hazmat suit? I'm not sure here. Open to ideas.  Unlock: Die to fire 3 times.  Backstory: Fireman was a surgeon before the apocalypse. A bomb landed near the hospital he worked at, not close enough to obliterate it, but close enough to light it on fire. A disgusting sickly green fire. He scavenged what protective gear he could, suffering a burn in the process. Then the hostile mutants showed up.  Starting weapon: Flare gun or standard revolver. Not sure here.  Passive: Nuclear Scar: Immune to fire (Making Boiling Veins less useful. Open to ideas here as well. Open to ideas basically anywhere.) Instead, the fire spreads around and behind him.  Active: Ignite: Fireman's next 15 shots are fire weapon shots. Explosive weapons spread out fire in their wake, while energy, melee and bolt weapons also have the fire weapon burn effect. Weapons that already shoot fire shoot additional projectiles. Buffs/nerfs? I'm also not sure how long the cooldown lasts, or what brings it off cooldown.  Throne Butt: First 5 shots under the effect of Ignite explode on impact with anything in addition to the fire effect. Grenades explode instantly on hitting a wall. Not sure what rockets do.  Ultra A: Pyromaniac: Ignite creates a burst of fire around Fireman.  Ultra B: Ashes to Ashes: Enemy corpses deal constant fire damage when enemies stand on them.  LOADING SCREEN TIPS   Fireman used to be a doctor Purge them You can't save them Do no harm Burn Hypocritical oath Fire cleanses Just a little longer Almost over Fireman still has hope Pyromaniac: All things must end Ashes to Ashes: Dust to Dust   I've got no art at the moment.

I have a few suggestions that what might be it:  1: You might be colour blind, and a special enemy is very hardly seen, or not at all, and it hits you.  2: Tiny enemies are hiding behind walls, and hurting you.  3:You swung a Blood Hammer, that takes away 1 HP if you miss an attack."

NuclearThrone,3c7bwc,Akosss,11,Sun Jul 5 16:57:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, scorpion bullets are just a few shades greener than the desert ground. With colorblindness, that must make them even harder to see."

NuclearThrone,3c7bnn,TheStupid0ne,8,Sun Jul 5 17:23:25 2015 UTC,my opinion is you cant really blame the game when it was the player's choice to use 2 weapons with VERY high ammo consumption. with YV too.
NuclearThrone,3c7bnn,leonvision,9,Sun Jul 5 22:14:23 2015 UTC,"So yeah, this is totally your fault. But melee for empty weapons is still a great mutation idea."
NuclearThrone,3c7bnn,TheMostCuriousThing,3,Mon Jul 6 00:08:58 2015 UTC,Whose fault is that?
NuclearThrone,3c6lgh,bigdooraoc,3,Sun Jul 5 09:18:03 2015 UTC,"Hold up, you never pick Boiling Veins when playing as Rogue? Risky business, that, especially since you never pick Strong Spirit or Rhino Skin. Guess that's a sign of confidence if anything."
NuclearThrone,3c6lgh,TwentySharks,3,Sun Jul 5 12:49:06 2015 UTC,"Originally I found myself VERY dependent on Rhino Skin or Boiling Veins that I couldn't get very far without them, so I forbade myself to pick them up. During the process I started to appreciate the all-aggressive-mutations build and realize RS and BV are not as important as I thought they are."
NuclearThrone,3c6lgh,TwentySharks,3,Sun Jul 5 13:06:28 2015 UTC,"I have actually found that Boiling Veins lets me be more aggressive since I can live without fear of Explo Freaks and Snowbots (and use the Portal Strike on top of my own head if I'm playing Rogue) and I like picking either Strong Spirit or Rhino Skin as a kind of insurance. I play Horror a lot so I find that I have enough offensive power either way.  By the way, good on you for picking Shotgun Shoulders. A lot of people seem to underestimate its strength but it is a good mutation. I don't pick it a lot but it's never disappointing when I do."
NuclearThrone,3c6lgh,Ethan_the_Lion,3,Sun Jul 5 13:17:00 2015 UTC,Your mutation choices heavily contrast what I would choose. Very interesting to see other players play styles considering you looped 9 times.

NuclearThrone,3c5wmd,Batteryhorse,3,Sun Jul 5 21:21:42 2015 UTC,It comes and goes in waves. I personally think it's because of the recent surge in modding. Now all these ideas that were just figments of our imagination have the chance to be playable characters in a mod. I imagine there was a recent surge before Vlambeer announced that Rogue was the last character to be added.
NuclearThrone,3c5wmd,BioOnPC,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:11:15 2015 UTC,how did they menage to create characters? i heard it was not possible/too hard
NuclearThrone,3c5wmd,jetio4,2,Sun Jul 5 03:17:13 2015 UTC,"If you mean the modders, it IS hard. Not too hard, mind you; just a bit of looking through the code and tracing everything back. But it is hard to actually be able to mod the game itself, because of the tools you need and how Gamemaker works."
NuclearThrone,3c5wmd,9joao6,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:30:18 2015 UTC,"To add to this, if you're already modding the game and adding content, the hard part of adding new characters isn't giving them stats/balancing/abilities/whatever, it's finding a place to put them on the title screen. You could add one where Big Dog used to be, I guess, but you'd probably have to change the entire design of the character select screen."

Steroids modified him, and so little dog became alive. Lil' Dog is smarter than his Big Brother. -at least he can use weapons. He knows nothing about the Nuclear Throne, but still wants to beat it.  Abilities   Passive   All bullet-projectiles (AKA Beachballs) damage you for 2hp instead of 3hp.   Active   Lil' Dog spins like his big brother, shooting bullet projectiles. (Jhoao's Note: It would be cool as heck if he shot 5 of whatever weapon he's holding. Imagine a laser spin!) Each spin costs 5 ammo (with more than 5 projectiles). They do 3 damage to enemies. (This would need to be changed if Lil' Dog could shoot whatever weapon he's using.)  Throne Butt  While spinning, Lil' Dog will shoot more projectiles.  Ultra A  While spinning, Lil' Dog will shoot slow-mo homing rockets. Lil' Dog is immune to them.  Ultra B  While spinning, Lil' dog will shoot a shitload of heavy projectiles, each one will do 6 damage to enemies. Each spin will cost 10 (!) bullet ammo.    That is actually a pretty neat concept for a character and the first I can see going in-game."
NuclearThrone,3c4qnm,Batteryhorse,3,Sat Jul 4 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"Decent concept, but the idea of having only 1/2 charges on the active doesn't fit the game very well.  I can see it encouraging players to make a wall and sit behind it for as long as possible, hoping enemies come into range so they can kill them safely. Not a fan of that sort of pace-slowing active, and neither are Vlambeer.  I'd suggest reworking both passive and active, making the active fire piercing shots at the cost of a few rads or something, and the passive something else."
NuclearThrone,3c4qnm,Dirst,2,Sat Jul 4 19:51:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your input!  What if the limit on the current active were removed? I mean, I mostly put the limit on because without it it seemed too much like Crystal's active, with Ultra B just being an objectively better version of the Crystal shield.  Your idea of having the passive become the active is an interesting one, but I'm not a fan of having it cost rads, since that's thematically Horror's thing, and I can't very well think of another viable downside. Maybe having it double reload time? But then it's veering into Pop Pop territory... Hm."
NuclearThrone,3c4qnm,Dirst,3,Sat Jul 4 20:42:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's tough to make a design that doesn't clash with existing mutants. Actually a pretty good sign that Vlambeer have done a great job on character designs themselves, since they cover all these basics.  If the limit on the active got removed, it would basically just be a better version of Crystal shield, as you said. Not sure how you can make this concept work as a whole, to be honest, without overlapping with existing things.  Then again, characters overlapping somewhat with mutations is already a thing. Crystal passively has extra health (Rhino Skin), Plant is fast (Extra Feet), so maybe one of Mole's abilities could be burrowing through walls (Hammerhead). Maybe you could work something out where you have to dig up blocks before being able to place them with the active. Manipulating the stage this heavily isn't something any characters can do, so it might be good. Would still need some kind of cost to placing or digging up blocks though, since otherwise one could make a tunnel and block it off to be practically invincible. Would be better to have the cost on placing though, since if it was only on digging, getting stuck would be possible."
NuclearThrone,3c4qnm,Dirst,2,Sat Jul 4 20:58:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'm not sure if this would be possible, but it might be a good idea to have the game perform a check as to whether constructing a wall would block off an important part of a level (aka chest, canister, or enemy) and block the construction if it would do so.  Actually, that does give me an idea! What if the active worked kind of like Plant's? Mole would be able to create up to X wall blocks at a time at the cursor's location, which would disappear in order as new ones were made."
NuclearThrone,3c4qnm,alrickattack,3,Sat Jul 4 21:14:25 2015 UTC,"That could work. Different enough from Crystal Shield to warrant being a new character, and completely different usage to Snares."

The second one is like Chicken's throw, expect not throwing weapons and has a cool down. Throne Butt is soppoused to only increase specials, not HP or anything at all. 3 health is now just insanely useless and its just Rebel's passive. Ultra B is good, but what if you don't catch the controllers? Basicly you pretty much have to wait about 5 minutes to get your controllers back.

Slugger (You can't take this off in any way) - Requires no ammo but takes 1HP for each shot   This is a pretty huge thing to notice. What happens if you fire it at 1 HP? Your starting weapon has awesome damage potential but is extremely deadly to yourself, potentially more dangerous than Melting in 1-1. And since you can never take it off, it would need to be a very good damage dealer in the late-game."
NuclearThrone,3c05nt,Jekh,7,Fri Jul 3 16:23:17 2015 UTC,"I can imagine the Adv. Slugger having no reload time (shoots as fast as you click), to make it strong lategame. The fact that it costs health to shoot means no matter how fast it fires, you probably don't want to spam it anyway.  I think that even with that, it would be a mediocre weapon, since 1 HP is always going to be worth more than 1 shell, and Gattling Slugger exists and is amazing.  Maybe if enemies killed by the Adv. Slugger had a much higher chance to drop pickups..."
NuclearThrone,3c05nt,Wiwiweb,5,Fri Jul 3 16:39:04 2015 UTC,Maybe instead of costing health every time it costs health when you don't have ammo like blood weapons and it consumes a lot of shell ammo and energy ammo to fire because energy would be used to make the shell powerful so you would need enough of both in order to fire like maybe 5 or 7 shells and 3 or 5 energy that might be a good way to balance it

NuclearThrone,3c1g3i,zanderthedestroyer,9,Fri Jul 3 21:54:03 2015 UTC,"Hades  And his pet dog  Starting Weapon  Old Revolver  Unlock  Beat Big Dog  Passive - Heavy Burden Hades can only carry one gun, but has increased max load for all weapons. His other slot is occupied by the heavy leash for his pet.  Active - Guard Dog Hades pet dog, Spot, is attached to him via a chain. The leash is short, and drags Spot as Hades moves, though doing so slows down Hades. Activating Spot causes him to leap in target direction and attack. Pulls Hades along slightly. Spot does contact damage and reflects bullets that hit him.  Throne Butt   Spot's chain length increases, and he no longer slows down Hades, instead following him before the leash pulls him.  Ultra A - Three Heads are Better Than One  Spot gains two extra heads and does significantly more damage.  Ultra B - Training  Free Spot from his leash. You gain a second weapon slot.     [CHANGELOG]  July 3, 2015 - Ultra B - Training nerfed. Spot no longer attacks on his own.  July 4, 2015 - Guard Dog - Spot now reflects bullets."
NuclearThrone,3c1g3i,kinglylightning,2,Sat Jul 4 03:48:07 2015 UTC,I really like this one.  Would Spot be usable for blocking enemy shots? Would he take damage from doing so?
NuclearThrone,3c1g3i,Dirst,2,Sat Jul 4 15:29:49 2015 UTC,"I had considered it. I wasn't sure if he should take damage and eventually pass out, or just reflect bullets all together. Unlike Rebel's Allies he's contact damage only, so he should be more durable, at the same time though I couldn't be too sure if he should be able to take damage so there was a risk for using him like that. Without actually being able to test it I couldn't say.  Right now I thought he would just be untargetable. Bullets would just go through him."
NuclearThrone,3c1g3i,kinglylightning,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:11:49 2015 UTC,"I think he should reflect bullets, but if he takes too much damage,  he should die and come back in the next level."
NuclearThrone,3c1g3i,TheLonelyPotato666,2,Sat Jul 4 17:42:35 2015 UTC,I changed it to him just reflecting bullets. Spot passing out for a level is a MAJOR hinderance considering you would then have to lug him around the rest of the level.
NuclearThrone,3c1g3i,kinglylightning,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:58:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe he'd just fall off, so you wouldn't have to carry him around.  But him reflecting bullets without a downside is actually a better idea imo."

After the apocalypse, his arm grew a little.   Appearance He looks like a crab. He has a red shell and his underbelly is a biege white hue. Because he is a fiddler crab, one of his arms is like 4 times the size of the other.  Passive Hard shell, weak underbelly - Crab -1 damage from above him, and +1 from below him.  Active Fiddle - Crab plays his fiddle and his enemies stop and listen (bosses excluded). Crab can still move when he is fiddling, but he cannot use his weapons. Bullets and all projectiles will move, but enemies will stand still and enjoy the 8-bit version of ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia."" Enemies can still attack and fire, but they'll be stuck in place mesmerized by his songs.

NuclearThrone,3c1g3i,Dirst,2,Sat Jul 4 04:45:26 2015 UTC,i think be because the player either faces left or right maybe a turtle standing upright would fit better. then the player could skillfully turn the other way if they knew they were getting hit to tank the damage.

NuclearThrone,3c1g3i,kinglylightning,6,Sat Jul 4 04:58:41 2015 UTC,"With the written permission of /u/munupu, I have been allowed to compose a re-worked version of his original idea. This is very much a work in-progress and feedback is appreciated.  To start things off...  The Artwork: http://imgur.com/o8DpDND (courtesy of /u/munupu)  Mutant Name:  Placid (Freak is already the name of an enemy type in the game and had to be replaced by a temporary placeholder.)  Origin:  Created in the Labs by rogue scientists enthralled by the Nuclear Throne's promise of power, Placid is a combination of an Alligator (captured as a live sample from the Sewers) and a Necromancer who willingly agreed to be experimented on in the name of science. Placid's weapon even reflects that of the Necromancer in design as further proof of this theory.  Starting Weapon: The Warlock  A revolutionary fusion of the common Shotgun and the Necromancer's revival weapon. Shoots a wide spread of enhanced shells (red in appearance) contained as ammo on the side of the pack worn on Placid's shoulders. Has a fire rate marginally faster than that of the normal Shotgun. The shells contain a non-lethal poision that causes enemies shot with it to temporarily attack their own allies (identified by a red glow in their eyes) for an unspecified amount of damage. Bosses are unaffected by this added effect but will still take damage from the initial shot. The weapon cannot be removed because it is connected to Placid's neural systems that are monitored by the scientists. To counter this dilemma, the damage of the weapon and the duration of mind-control scales with the difficulty of the level capping off at 25 (as to make it viable as a multi-looping weapon but not make it overpowered. This aspect of the weapon is very much in-progress).  Passive:  Due to mutations implanted in Placid, he will take reduced damage from attacks with a very small state of invulnerability afterwards. Strong Spirit does not add extended i-frames to this passive ability.  Active:  Releasing heat exhaust from his pack, a red cloud of noxious gas will be emitted as long as the user holds the right-click down. Placid has a meter similar to Rogue's Portal Strike to indicate how much exhaust he has left. Exhaust is built up over time by using his starting weapon. Placid is immune to these gases.  Play Style:  Mildly aggressive. Making use of Placid's various utilities is vital to clearing the game with this character. Due to the strong presence of such a mutant, Placid is only unlocked by looping and clearing the Labs and the Sewers in their respective orders twice. When re-working this mutant's idea, I couldn't help but think of how Horror is currently the most powerful mutant and how it might need balancing by including other powerful mutants to the roster. Probably not the most ideal way to balance a broken character.  Throne Butt/Ultras A & B not yet implemented  (Mutant ideas very much in-progress. /u/munupu may also provide feedback and ultimately controls the direction of this idea.)"
NuclearThrone,3c1g3i,regenking,3,Sat Jul 4 07:58:43 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you were going for it, but it seems like his active should really act as a reload for The Warlock. Once the Warlock builds up enough exhaust, you have to dump the whole thing before being able to fire anymore.  Other random ideas: Have the shells only have a percentage chance of inflicting enemies.   The Red Shells maybe can't bounce off walls unless the mutation for extended range is taken.   Being able to still only have one weapon, but you can switch it with other pick up's; different weapons generate different heat loads.  For a Throne Butt you can change the active to be able to dump a toxic package down that can be shot for a blood explosion around it, or toss the package initially."

Her two ultras emphasize potential gameplay strategies: either staying close-ranged and going completely wild, or taking a more careful, potentially more rewarding approach.  CHARACTER PORTRAIT: http://i.imgur.com/rlz23kS.png  IDLE STANCE: http://i.imgur.com/MsrrNcp.png  BACKSTORY: Mole was a coal miner before the apocalypse. As the radiation slowly took her, she found her hands growing, her skin becoming thicker, her other senses becoming sharper as her eyes slowly disappeared...  APPEARANCE: A mole standing on two legs, with a miner helmet.  PASSIVE: DIGGER: Can break through walls of thickness 2 or less. BLIND: Every level has the darkness effect of transition levels.  ACTIVE: COVER BREAKER: Shoots her active weapon at triple ammo cost. The shot(s) produces will ignore up to seven wall tiles before despawning.  THRONE BUTT: Decreases Cover Breaker's cost to double ammo.  ULTRA A (FULL BORE): All shots have the Cover Breaker effect. Active now pierces through enemies as well as walls.

Character name: Fireman  Appearance: Bald human male with a burnt face, surgical mask and flame retardant suit.   B Skin: Full hazmat suit? I'm not sure here. Open to ideas.  Unlock: Die to fire 3 times.  Backstory: Fireman was a surgeon before the apocalypse. A bomb landed near the hospital he worked at, not close enough to obliterate it, but close enough to light it on fire. A disgusting sickly green fire. He scavenged what protective gear he could, suffering a burn in the process. Then the hostile mutants showed up.  Starting weapon: Flare gun or standard revolver. Not sure here.  Passive: Nuclear Scar: Immune to fire (Making Boiling Veins less useful. Open to ideas here as well. Open to ideas basically anywhere.) Instead, the fire spreads around and behind him.  Active: Ignite: Fireman's next 15 shots are fire weapon shots. Explosive weapons spread out fire in their wake, while energy, melee and bolt weapons also have the fire weapon burn effect. Weapons that already shoot fire shoot additional projectiles. Buffs/nerfs? I'm also not sure how long the cooldown lasts, or what brings it off cooldown.  Throne Butt: First 5 shots under the effect of Ignite explode on impact with anything in addition to the fire effect. Grenades explode instantly on hitting a wall. Not sure what rockets do.  Ultra A: Pyromaniac: Ignite creates a burst of fire around Fireman.  Ultra B: Ashes to Ashes: Enemy corpses deal constant fire damage when enemies stand on them.

NuclearThrone,3c10yk,Exoskeletal65,2,Sat Jul 4 05:04:54 2015 UTC,"Did you open all of the chests on 1-1 without killing very much? If so, beating Big Bandit quickly will take you to a hidden level called the Oasis."
NuclearThrone,3c0wyr,piemonke,6,Fri Jul 3 19:22:47 2015 UTC,"I like the concept of a ghosty character, but the passive and active both need work. The idea of cursed weapons being stronger doesn't really work anymore because you can swap cursed weapons for other cursed weapons, meaning they're a lot more viable than before, and giving them extra damage is a bit silly since the character will only ever use cursed weapons anyway.  And I don't like the idea of an active that requires you to take damage before it's usable. Would be better if it just resurrected the spirit of the last enemy you killed, at some cost, be it health or rads. Actives that can't be spammed aren't really part of this game, and all actives are designed to have no cooldowns, and only limited by resources (ammo for YV/Steroids, health for Rebel, rads for Horror, charges for Rogue, no limits on others)"
NuclearThrone,3c0wyr,Dirst,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:33:36 2015 UTC,"i kinda like the passive, it will use only cursed, yes, but he will only get like half of the weapons he can get, making good weapons rarer.  i agree with you for the active tho"
NuclearThrone,3c0wyr,FMarkassa,-1,Sun Jul 5 03:11:58 2015 UTC,I was literally just about to post a character idea named spectre.  2 hours 2 latei cri everytiem  now i have to come up with a different name
NuclearThrone,3c2eyh,sociodouble,2,Sat Jul 4 03:17:35 2015 UTC,I really really really like this. I hope Rami or JW read this because it seems like a very cool character.

I mean; A nuclear apocalypse. Ying-Yang would INSANELY just stick out from the others. Sorry, but negative feed back. I highly dislike this idea."
NuclearThrone,3c2eyh,Akosss,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:45:10 2015 UTC,do you dislike the mechanics or the appearance? I understand that it would stick out but I was simply adapting the idea. You could have a character that switched with its own shadow or something with the same abilities. Would you still dislike the character if the appearance changed?
NuclearThrone,3c2eyh,Akosss,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:45:39 2015 UTC,"Not at all. The mechanics do sound fun, just a literal Yin Yang symbol  would just stick out from the other mutants."

NuclearThrone,3c0te1,darklightofnigh,5,Fri Jul 3 18:55:48 2015 UTC,Ball mum is just the worst because you can't get close to her most of the time because of all the toxic which you have to dodge. You end up wasting all your ammo and she still wont die because you can't use your ammo quick enough and the toxic she creates keeps healing her.
NuclearThrone,3c0te1,sociodouble,2,Sat Jul 4 00:20:23 2015 UTC,you have to have the right weapon set for sure when it comes to ball mum
NuclearThrone,3c0te1,lipman19,3,Sat Jul 4 01:41:49 2015 UTC,I know but you might need to take weapons that aren't right for ball mum because they are better for everything that isn't ball mum. Also it isn't always possible to find the right weapons.
NuclearThrone,3c0te1,sociodouble,2,Sat Jul 4 03:30:13 2015 UTC,yeah I know I think I was more getting at the point of needing to take certain weapons to beat a boss being dumb

NuclearThrone,3c0te1,Emc73,2,Sat Jul 4 02:26:59 2015 UTC,Lil' Bandit because he's such a small target.

NuclearThrone,3c0te1,Mate9,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:52:30 2015 UTC,Lil' Hunter because I've never beaten him >.<
NuclearThrone,3c0te1,purehatred89,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:12:32 2015 UTC,"Lil' Hunter. Easily the most difficult just for the sheer spam. Most recent update doesn't help, either. Had over 20 IDPD spawn in less than 15 seconds on my most recent run against him. It's just stupid.  As Crystal he's nothing. Just stand in the spawn and wait, reflect bullets back. I haven't had a difficult time with any boss except for him."
NuclearThrone,3c0te1,Beardalelist,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:09:21 2015 UTC,"Lil Hunter, because it is such a sporadic and unforgiving boss especially for how early in the game it appears. I'll have a good run going and make one small mistake and get insta killed. Maybe I will get a bad spawn and get overran by everything on the screen. All in all it is a very tough boss which is only getting more and more tough as the updates roll out to the public."
NuclearThrone,3c1mdw,QTheNew42Q,4,Fri Jul 3 22:45:43 2015 UTC,That passive seems crazy op. You could just hide inside of walls whenever an enemy shoots at you.
NuclearThrone,3c1mdw,8988303682,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:18:33 2015 UTC,What do you think of his new passive?
NuclearThrone,3c1mdw,8988303682,2,Sun Jul 5 02:02:05 2015 UTC,But you can melee through walls. Also it's basically like Crystals shield that you can move around with.
NuclearThrone,3c1mdw,FMarkassa,2,Sat Jul 4 17:53:44 2015 UTC,"btw, you can uncurse a weapon going inside crown vault....  edit 1: why did you set when you can find a scythe if its his starting wep? normally exclusive-character's weapons cant be used by others (chicken's sword, rogue rifle, guitar and golden pistol)"
NuclearThrone,3c1mdw,zanderthedestroyer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:56:36 2015 UTC,"I didn't know that actually, thanks  Also, I was going to edit the scythe's effects so I might as well make it exclusive to him."

NuclearThrone,3bzhb8,Sharp_butter_knife,2,Fri Jul 3 14:50:12 2015 UTC,One thing that might help is to play more patient. Sometimes it's just completely wrong to run out guns blazing.
NuclearThrone,3bzhb8,Gregar70,2,Fri Jul 3 16:17:53 2015 UTC,I always play patient and always made it to the second leve of the frozen city and could never get past it.

NuclearThrone,3bzhb8,thefirstjoe,2,Sat Jul 4 02:29:23 2015 UTC,"Time, more than anything. What I've learned from playing for 200+ hours is that what gets people to improve is experience. You'll slowly develop a sense of what to look out for (like shooting at ammo chests after 1_3, or at least looking for the glimmer), when to hide, and how to avoid certain enemies. Don't give up, just keep playing and keep learning."
NuclearThrone,3bzhb8,Snoopymario987,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:20:53 2015 UTC,I just hope that practice makes perfect in this game (i suck probably more than you.)

Bisnap's commentary is very informative and analytical (kinda his motto but has more or less faded). He knows his stuff about the game and does an episode pretty much at least every other day if not every. Last I checked on his schedule he has 2 time slots for potential NT episodes, but never more than 1 per day."

IS THERE ANY GOOD REASON TO ADD CHEAP DIFFICULTY LIKE THAT TO THE GAME? LET US HAVE A SECOND OF INVINCIBILITY FOR STRONG SPIRIT - I'M TIRED OF HAVING IT AND DYING TO EXPLOSIONS AND CONTACT DAMAGE OUT-AND-OUT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS BOILING VEINS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SHARP TEETH AND GAMMA GUTS. I CHOOSE STRONG SPIRIT BECAUSE IT'S A SAFE GROUND BETWEEN ALL OF THEM. JEEZ, I'VE BEEN KILLED BY EXPLOSIONS CARRYING OVER THROUGH STRONG SPIRIT SINCE THE UPDATE MORE THAN I CAN COUNT. CONTACT DAMAGE FROM SNOW WOLVES AND SNOW CYBORGS STILL CARRY OVER. LITTLE HUNTER FLAME DAMAGE STILL CARRIES OVER. NUCLEAR BEAR CONTACT DAMAGE STILL CARRIES OVER. IT ALL CARRIES OVER. 1/6TH OF A SECOND IS LUDICROUS. DURING THE FULL SECOND UPDATE, I CAN'T THINK OF ONE TIME THAT I DIED DURING AN EXPLOSION OR CONTACT DAMAGE. IT WAS FANTASTIC AND MADE IT A VERY STRONG MUTATION THAT SERIOUSLY HELPED RUNS. NOW IT'S BACK TO LITTLE TO NO PURPOSE, MAYBE A VERY NICHE SITUATION THAT IT CAN HELP IN.  LITTLE HUNTER'S BUFF IS CRAZY. I STILL BEAT HIM THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME, BUT CHRIST ALIVE, IT'S A WHOLE 'NOTHER LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY NOW. IT'S FUN, BUT CRAZY FAST PACED. I CAN BARELY CLEAR A AREA FOR FIGHTING BEFORE HE SPAWNS IN. THE CONSTANT STREAM OF IDPD IS NUTS. IN ONE FIGHT WITH HIM I HAD AT LEAST 16 IDPD SPAWN IN, 2 BY 2 AS SOON AS THEY DIED. COME ON. THAT'S CRAZY. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT MANY IDPD ON THE THRONE FIGHT.  I LOOPED TWICE 4 TIMES IN A ROW TODAY. SUCK IT, THRONE.   SPEAKING OF LOOPING, I FIND EVERY CHARACTER OTHER THAN CRYSTAL BASICALLY POINTLESS FOR EXTREME BULLET-HELL GIVEN THE STANDARD WEAPONS YOU FIND ON AN AVERAGE RUN. I MEAN, CHRIST. I CAN WALK INTO THE MIDDLE OF CROWN OF BLOOD AND HOLD DOWN RIGHT CLICK AND CLEAR A DECENT AMOUNT OF SPACE. SHE ISN'T OVERPOWERED. SHE HAS THAT TIMER ON HER ABILITY FOR A REASON. I JUST THINK THAT SHE IS THE MOST PRACTICAL, LATELY - ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THE TWEAKING TO I-FRAMES AND NEW BUFFS TO ENEMIES.  SPEAKING OF RIGHT CLICK, I'M STILL ANNOYED WITH CHICKEN. GRACIOUS, I MEAN IF YOU THINK SLOW TIME SLOWED DOWN GAMEPLAY, THROWING A PERFECTLY GOOD WEAPON DOES IT EVEN MORE. IF ANYTHING, WHY WASN'T CHICKEN'S SLOW-TIME ABILITY PUT ON A TIMER LIKE CRYSTAL'S SHIELD? IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME THING - ONE SLOWS TIME ENOUGH FOR YOU TO DODGE BULLETS, ONE LETS YOU REFLECT. COULD'VE LET CHICKEN SLOW TIME 5 SECONDS AT A TIME AND HAVE A COOLDOWN. WOULD'VE BEEN SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO SOLVE ANY ISSUE RIGHT THERE AS FAR AS I CAN SEE. HECK, YOU COULD HAVE IT FADE FROM GRAY-SCALE TO COLORED AGAIN TO SHOW THE AMOUNT OF TIME LEFT ON THE TIMER. I HAVE TRIED AND TRIED AND LOOPED AND LOOPED WITH CHICKEN. WHY WOULD I EVER THROW MY SUPER PLASMA CANNON OR AUTO HEAVY CROSSBOW? WHY? DO I LOOK LIKE A SCRUB THAT RUNS INTO AMMO PROBLEMS? SURE, LET ME JUST TOSS THIS PRACTICALLY GAME-WINNING WEAPON FOR ABOUT AS MUCH DAMAGE AS A BOLT AND GO FIND IT AGAIN - NOT TO MENTION NOT GET ANY AMMO FOR IT IN THE INTERIM. THE ABILITY IS A CUTE REFERENCE TO HOTLINE MIAMI OR WHATEVER. SO WHAT? IF I WANTED TO PLAY HOTLINE MIAMI, I'D GO PLAY IT. IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A NINJA CHARACTER, GIVE HER SLOW MOTION. GOODNESS. I FIND CHICKEN POINTLESS, NOW. SHE HAS HER HEADLESS ABILITY - BASICALLY A GLORIFIED STRONG SPIRIT. I HAVE HAD IT SUCCESSFULLY ACTIVATE LESS THAN 10 TIMES IN ALL THE TIME I PLAYED HER. BLOODLUST AND RABBIT PAW DON'T GO FAR WHEN YOU'RE BODY CAN'T EITHER. BETTER YET, LONG ARMS. GIVE HER LONG ARMS.  EYES PASSIVE IS UNNECESSARY. WITH EVERY OTHER CHARACTER, JUST HUG THE WALL AND WORK YOUR WAY IN ON LEVELS THAT YOU CAN'T SEE. WHY DO I CARE WITH EYES? WHY? DO SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE - GIVE HIM EAGLE EYES OFF THE BAT - THAT'S AT LEAST USEFUL.  WHERE DID THE VAULT GUARDIANS GO? THOSE GUYS WERE AWESOME AND UNIQUE. WOULDN'T BE SO MUCH OF A CHALLENGE FOR SOME PEOPLE IF STRONG SPIRIT ACTUALLY WORKED.  I'M ANNOYED WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF THE CROWN VAULT, BUT I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND IT IS A WIP AND THAT WE SHOULD MAKE THE BEST OF THE CURRENT SITUATION.  I KEEP SEEING ALL THESE 60 FPS MOCK-UPS OF THE GAME AND IT LOOKS AMAZING. I UNDERSTAND THAT 30 FPS WAS DECIDED UPON NOT ONLY FOR AESTHETIC PURPOSES BUT LIMITATIONS OF THE GAME ITSELF. STILL, THOUGH, BLEH. WANT IT.  I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE JUNGLE IN IT'S CURRENT STATE. IT HAS NO ADVANTAGE TO THE FROZEN CITY. PIZZA TIME HAS HEALTH, THE OASIS IS A SHORTCUT, Y.V.'S MANSION HAS GOLD WEAPONS, BACK 2 BIZNIZ HAS A SHOOTING GALLERY, BASICALLY, THE CURSED CRYSTAL CHEESE CAVES ARE A PUNISHMENT FOR CURSED WEAPONS, THE CROWN VAULT HAS CROWNS - WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT THE JUNGLE? AND DON'T TELL ME ABOUT UNLOCKS, LAH-DEE-DAH. NONE OF THE PRIOR HAD UNLOCKS BUT STILL SERVED A PURPOSE. GIVE IT A SPECIAL WEAPON, ABILITY, SHORTCUT, OR BENEFIT AND I'LL GO. MAKE IT SKIP LITTLE HUNTER AND I'LL ALWAYS GO, PRACTICALLY. LITTLE SUAREZ NEEDS TO BE AVOIDABLE IF I HAVE TO TAKE LAST WISH.  ALSO, LAST WISH. COME ON. MAKE IT USEFUL IF I HAVE TO TAKE IT. JEEZ.  I LOVE THIS GAME."

NuclearThrone,3bwnyk,crazed-one,4,Thu Jul 2 19:36:42 2015 UTC,"I was actually thinking of something Similar to what RoDDusty said. Though alternatively I was also thinking Chicken could have a unique Alt Fire for every Melee weapon.  So for instance, Chicken Sword could do say the multiple slashes thing, on a long cooldown. Sledgehammer could maybe do the AOE attack. Shovel would like create a barrier in front of you, screwdriver could like, hack supply crates to change them or something."
NuclearThrone,3bwnyk,kinglylightning,3,Fri Jul 3 00:10:46 2015 UTC,"I think throwing weapons can work in a pinch, but like you said there's a major downside of not being able to attack without anything in your hands. I think Chicken should have an unarmed melee attack, since she can lose both of her weapons."
NuclearThrone,3bwnyk,Jerln,2,Fri Jul 3 00:42:28 2015 UTC,"chicken should have a stealth attack, where it goes invisible for 2-3 seconds and if it attacks in that time the stealth goes away and it does 1.5x damage. I think this could really work to get around some of melees weaknesses, and it gives melee on chicken more ""range"" by making enemies not able to shoot and dealing extra damage. This would be better than the pop-pop ability and much better than the weapon throw already there. My other suggestion is that if you throw a weapon after 3or 4 seconds another weapon spawns in its place, like something that you can't use to attack and you can only use to throw  Just ideas I'm putting out there!"

NuclearThrone,3bwnyk,oposdeo,2,Fri Jul 3 04:49:47 2015 UTC,"It could absolutly work with weapons, a 360 spin/higher rate of fire attack.

Ultra A = more dps/range (2x proc melee/X-Tra shots fired). Ultra B = Vacuume effect, suck in enemies while in use."

NuclearThrone,3bwnyk,RoDDusty,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:01:14 2015 UTC,"The longer I think about this ability the more problems I see with implementing it. (Spam right click to kill everything, would have to be very weak to prevent it from removing the need to use weapons, would have to make you temporarily invincible to damage to differentiate it from gamma gutts + run into enemy, not useful at all if it replaces thrown weapons since guns are more effective, etc.)  edit: Essentially, just don't throw both of your weapons if you can't get them back. It's not hard."
NuclearThrone,3bwnyk,oposdeo,2,Fri Jul 3 05:06:01 2015 UTC,"I never see a reason to throw my weapon while using chicken.  But I think the concept of throwing melee weapons is interesting.  I've got a few suggestions for buffing the throw.  Thrown weapons remain stuck in enemies until death, causing a bleeding effect.  Thrown weapons will be replaced with a fist until another weapon is picked up  New Throne Butt,  On a right click following a weapon throw, Chicken teleports to her nearest thrown weapon, if it is currently stuck in an enemy, she will immediately attack, throwing the enemy in the direction of the cursor.  If the weapon is not in an enemy, she will automatically pick it up.  Ultra B, Butcher;  Any kills via chicken's active will demoralize enemies in radius around the kill, causing them to freeze for 3 seconds."
NuclearThrone,3bwnyk,Xeo_Nespydonum,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:58:11 2015 UTC,"What about the utility aspect to the throw? Surely, when you factor that in, it gives it more of a use. No more wasting a slot to bring a screwdriver/grenade launcher to the next level, in fact, you could bring a screwdriver all the way from 1-1 and still get your two weapon slots. Or late game, you can bring all 5 weapons you saw on the previous level into the portal with you. No more hard choices between Gatling slugger, seeker shotgun, and lightning smg. You can have all three. Portals are weaker now so it's definitely feasible. Add that stuff to the fact that thrown weapons do decent damage and with throne butt is just ridiculous."
NuclearThrone,3bwnyk,TheMehr,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:22:29 2015 UTC,"I think Chicken is in a very good place as-is. She has a nice theme, hard-to-kill, in that it's organized and designed rather nicely for both running out of health and ammo (even the ultras line up!). I think throw is fine because it not only fits her theme very well as a desperation move when you're out of options, but with boomerang you essentially have an unlimited-ammo crossbow at your disposal at all times, allowing you to carry two short-ranged weapons without crippling yourself against enemies like big crystal and therefore emphasizing melee without even directly influencing it. Throw can save your life, you just can't use it whenever you feel like, you have to save it for desperate panic moments, and it certainly isn't underpowered, due to the instant reload on weapon pickup. When you're stuck in a corner with only a super-plasma cannon, throw will not only kill the freak that's about to maul you, but also let you lob another shot and instantly get you back into the action.  I don't think all actives have to be fantastic run-carriers like Horror's, Chicken is more passive oriented in general anyways and having a powerful active in addition to (arguably) the most powerful long-term passive in the game wouldn't really be too fair for the other mutants.  As well, I like that no character directly builds off of a certain weapon type, letting you keep your options open at any time. Some are /better/ on others (melee on chicken, laser on rogue, bolt on melting, etc.) but none have perks directly relating to a weapon type. Rather, the situations and abilities that they have slightly influence which weapons are going to be more useful, and Chicken already is the melee character because of this."
NuclearThrone,3bwnyk,Vulpenze,3,Thu Jul 2 22:11:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input.  I just can't agree about Chicken's active being good right now, though. For me its use drops ridiculously fast and it only every gets good with the Ultra + Throne Butt, but I don't think it's fair to judge an active solely based on when it's combined with Throne Butt and a specific Ultra.  I can't think of a single time the active would be more useful past the first area than a secondary, and for you to be using it as a life savior, then chances are you don't have much life left in you if a secondary can't do the saving or you're out of ammo on both of weapons.  I can agree about not limiting characters to a single weapon type, but at the same time, we do have YV which heavily favors ranged over melee.  Nonetheless, as it stands right now, it's not even close to being about the active being a fantastic run-carrier, it's about barely not even being there.  But I'm hoping to see better suggestions than mine or that Vlambeer, in the long run, improves the active further, because, as of now, there's two things I'm sure plenty people agree with: Chicken is probably the worst character and there's quite a few imbalanced/not fun Throne Butts and Ultras, so I don't think passing judgement solely out of comparisons is fair."
NuclearThrone,3bwnyk,Vulpenze,0,Thu Jul 2 23:21:45 2015 UTC,"I'm exactly the opposite on ""Chicken is probably the worst character"". I think she's probably the most powerful character in the game post-loop, right now. Her Passive + Ultra A makes you essentially immortal.  Got this last week, for example. http://i.imgur.com/sY0nfyn.png And at several points in this run, almost always against big crystal or in a corner with little ammo and a freak right on me, I would've died without Chicken's throw because it's the only long-range alternative when you have no ammo left and which doesn't rely on weapon drops. It's not spectacular but it saves your life when you would've otherwise had no options left.  And I wouldn't say YV focuses ranged over melee at all. Sure, his active doesn't work with melee, but the synergy his passive provides with them more than makes up for it considering it can nullify the need for trigger-fingers to maintain a constant shield, only YV and Steroids can maintain it without needing stress/trigger-fingers."
NuclearThrone,3bwnyk,oposdeo,0,Fri Jul 3 00:05:15 2015 UTC,"This is turning a bit too much into a monologue.  Look, loop 5, yes, that's great, crazy even and props to you on that, but you can't balance a character's active solely on its combination with Throne But + the specific Ultra. I mean you can, but it's not a very good design.  Hell you even said it yourself the only reason you got that far was because of Chicken's passive with Ultra A, so I doubt it you wouldn't have manage it were the active still slow motion.  It's not because some people playing Plant with its Throne Butt and still struggling with early bosses that the mutation isn't kinda overpowered (at least before the latest patch anyway). Exceptions don't make the rules.   And I wouldn't say YV focuses ranged over melee at all.   Now you're just being annoyingly contrarian.   The passive affects all kinds of weapons so wherever you see an advantage on melee it applies to every single other weapon.   And his active, on the other hand, completely ignores all melees so how the hell does it not focus more on ranged?!"
NuclearThrone,3bwnyk,oposdeo,0,Fri Jul 3 00:27:40 2015 UTC,"YV's passive works on all weapons including melee, however due to game mechanics not related to YV, the melee projectiles are unable to all hit simultaneously.  He is also not restricted to one weapon or weapon type as mentioned earlier. There are 6 weapon types, and his active happens to be effective with 5 of them. He is a heavy burst fire kind of character, and of course, needs weapons that actually fire. Steroids' throne butt does not work with melee weapons either, nor does lucky shot, or rabbit paw, or anything related to ammo, becayse they don't use ammo. It would be ludicrous to call this a problem. Melee weapons are not guns, they should not act like guns."
NuclearThrone,3bwnyk,oposdeo,-2,Fri Jul 3 04:47:34 2015 UTC,"I think chicken's throw ability is one of the most powerful abilities, post-loop. With piercing and thrown weapons come back, he can easily mow down entire lines of enemies and deal extreme damage to bosses, from a safe distance, for 0 ammo which is great considering the constant issue of ammo people face during loops.  As far as I see it, with the ultra and throne butt, it is my favorite ability in the game, but before that it is very situational, kind of like eyes' active ability actually. That has been happily resting in the game for a long time without much criticism, and is similarly not very good if you don't know when to use it.  edit: I also think melee weapons are in a pretty good state. More melee weapons wouldn't hurt of course, but they offer ammoless, AOE burst damage and bullet reflection, which make even the sledgehammer a useful weapon far into the game. I would certainly like it though if you didn't get useless ammo types from ammo packs when carrying one."
NuclearThrone,3bwmkz,crazed-one,9,Thu Jul 2 19:26:37 2015 UTC,"I still thing that energy sword is the single strongest weapon in the game,simply because laser brain literaly doubles it's damage"
NuclearThrone,3bwmkz,mantrica,5,Thu Jul 2 20:04:22 2015 UTC,"Definitely, but I mean, do you risk choosing laser brain and long arms and maybe trigger fingers as soon as they show up or wait for the gun itself to show up and possibly miss the chance on the mutation(s) entirely?  Having a slight way of assuring you'd eventually get an energy melee weapons (or at least a higher probability, by having the said greater chance for any melee) should make the process a little more fun, right?  Or is it too much against NT's heavy RNG philosophy?  I'm genuinely asking, because by the way the post is getting downvoted with no comments I'm guessing it might be just that."
NuclearThrone,3bwmkz,hollyweedsfinest,3,Thu Jul 2 20:58:29 2015 UTC,"for me personally, i often find that the mutations i get later in the game (crystal caves+) decide, which weapon i will roll with. the spawns of the weapons are too random to decide your endgame weapon loadout. many great weapons (like the energy sword) start dropping at around the crystal caves, so you usually have a few mutations left to get something that benefits your weapon.  in the beginning of the run, i focus on muations which are always useful, like rabbit paw. thus, i wouldnt pick laser brain based off the thought that i MIGHT get an energy sword later. NT is too random for planning ahead."
NuclearThrone,3bwmkz,TheLonelyPotato666,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:14:53 2015 UTC,"Good point, maybe messing with weapon chance just isn't right for NT.  At least not directly, but you can always affect it by adding more melee weapons instead."

NuclearThrone,3bwmkz,Vulpenze,3,Fri Jul 3 15:18:42 2015 UTC,"I'll be making a detailed post about this in the near future, but I'd like to put my two cents in: Eyes with melee is deadly.   It's a risky strategy-yes, getting the right mutations won't always happen, and sometimes finding a decent melee is hard to come by, but if you can get a build going, the synergy with his active is extremely powerful. It's not just defensive, since you can pull enemies toward you and wack them to bits.  As an Eyes main, I've managed to loop using solely a golden wrench.  Edit: To address scarier face, there are only two points in which you could call it ""necessary"". It causes one-hit kills with the wrench on crows, and with the shovel on crystal spiders. If you can manage to get over those humps (or find an energy sword, ultra shovel, etc.) then a run is definitely okay without it. As for long arms and trigger fingers, yes, you have to rely on those. But from my experience having one and not the other is okay."
NuclearThrone,3bwmkz,Vulpenze,3,Fri Jul 3 00:35:24 2015 UTC,"I think you're looking at things the wrong way, melee is more of a defensive weapon type, not offensive. The ability to block/reflect projectiles/lasers and keep enemies away from you is one of the main upsides; the ability to multi-hit, immunity to reflection, insta-gib dashing targets, hit through walls, and more, it all help to solidify this, you take a melee weapon more for safety than for damage.  Edit: I should mention, as well, I personally think ultra-shovel is the single most powerful weapon in the game  with long-arms (once looping, obviously)."
NuclearThrone,3bxgbx,QTheNew42Q,3,Thu Jul 2 23:20:44 2015 UTC,Huh. I like the concept.

NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Nazerr666,29,Thu Jul 2 11:20:46 2015 UTC,"I take the Pop Gun over the Assault Rifle, always. I just don't understand the ""downside"" of having a larger hitbox, fuckin' BOUNCY BULLETS YO."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,9joao6,15,Thu Jul 2 12:35:12 2015 UTC,"infinite range is pretty nice to have, bullets also deal 50% more dmg than the pellets the pop gun fires."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,wour,2,Thu Jul 2 13:53:45 2015 UTC,"Infinite range can be very useful, true, but unless you're dealing with Snipers, most enemies should be inside your reach anyway, right?  I had no idea it had a damage penalty though, bullets seem to 2-shot bandits and so does the Pop Gun, but it seems fair."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,9joao6,13,Thu Jul 2 13:56:22 2015 UTC,"don't get me wrong, the pop gun's DPS is way higher, but it consumes a lot more ammo to get the same result."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,wour,7,Thu Jul 2 14:04:32 2015 UTC,Fair point!
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,9joao6,4,Thu Jul 2 14:09:22 2015 UTC,"Also despite being a bullet type gun, recycle gland doesn't effect pop weapons."

NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,piemonke,5,Fri Jul 3 06:04:43 2015 UTC,"I'm right with you.  The range of the assault rifle is nice, but I love the pop gun, the brutal dps shreds the desert and sewers, and the bouncy bullets are incredibly nice against the rats.  By the time I hit the junkyard I try to have some kind of decent non-bullet weapon anyway, so I'm never too worried about the ammo consumption."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,KoboldCommando,4,Thu Jul 2 20:03:09 2015 UTC,"Steroids, double pop gun, shotgun shoulders. Nothing else is needed. Well, until you die/run out of ammo, but it is crazy fun."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,xMusicaCancer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:34:49 2015 UTC,"AR is way more ammo efficient with only slightly lower DPS, but I agree that Pop Gun is a close second for early game bullet weapons. The fact that you can hold down your mouse for three seconds and kill Big Bandit speaks for itself."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Chryscord,12,Thu Jul 2 18:54:43 2015 UTC,"There's no actual mutation variety.  There's too many ""core"" mutations or, in other words, too many mutations that are too good and a bunch that are just bad.  How many people actually skip Rabbit's Paw, 2nd Stomach, Scarier Face, Back Muscle and arguably Strong Spirit or Rhino Skin?  In the end you don't choose 10 random mutations, you choose around 4,  or 3 if your character's throne butt is invaluable."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,crazed-one,3,Thu Jul 2 21:10:45 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. I don't care if it would ""clutter"" the mutation pool, having more specific mutations (such as only flame weapons or only lightening weapons) would make for more variable runs."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,piemonke,3,Fri Jul 3 06:07:28 2015 UTC,I think it would be better for the mutation to make all future weapons flame/lightning weapons.
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,FREE_OREO,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:19:06 2015 UTC,"I don't agree. The mutations should be balanced, but adding in mutations only affecting flame weapons (and other specific weapon types) would suck."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,TheLonelyPotato666,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:46:13 2015 UTC,"I consistently skip scarier face, rhino skin, and back muscle often. My ammo management is fine without back muscle, rhino skin changes nothing of my run, and I rarely find a use for scarier face. If I have bloodlust I'll pick that over anything you mentioned. NT suffers from some mutation disbalance, but it isn't just those that are the god mutations. Bloodlust is a lifesaver, racing mind saves runs, open mind is never a bad choice, impact wrists is a chaos engine, bolt marrow and laser brain are completely insane with the right weapons, etc... Alot of mutations in this game are great if you spend enough time with them and figure out how they work together.  Of the mutations, the ones I consistently skip over are Last Wish (obviously), Gamma Guts, Shotgun Shoulders, Recycle Gland(tfw popgun), Rhino Skin, Lucky Shot, and usually stress.  Almost every mutation in this game is good. Almost."

NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Mate9,18,Thu Jul 2 21:18:37 2015 UTC,"Lil hunter is my favourite part of the game.  He's such a cool, clever boss! More so before he got changed. Like, he used to dodge better than you can, his attacks were undodgeable nearly, he can kill you instantly, he can destroy your cover.  He's basically to you what you are to the other monsters in nuclear throne, which is the whole point of the IDPD, they're like the player. Lil hunter is just the only one with the killing power, abilities, health and tactics."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Emc73,24,Thu Jul 2 14:17:37 2015 UTC,"You're right. That is an unpopular opinion.  I can see where you're coming from, but I feel he was too much of a gear check when he was in his godlike triple bullet spray, dodging every bolt you throw at him mode."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Shgrizz,6,Thu Jul 2 14:42:19 2015 UTC,"You could always hit him when he lands, though. You just have to time it right. You can do it with any gear.  Basically, the way to beat lil hunter was to outsmart him. I liked that a lot."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Emc73,4,Thu Jul 2 14:55:33 2015 UTC,"I consider myself a pretty good player, and I'd estimate I get to the throne once in every 2-3 runs. However, I was getting to the point where I'd have to build specifically against lil hunter, as he was the thing which was by far the most likely to randomly end my run if I I didn't. Melee or homing bolts were the only things that would consistently kill him. Bullets, explosives, lasers, shells? Forget about it. You certainly did have to outsmart him, but he was a huge roadblock for enjoying the rest of the game. I can't imagine how noobs dealt with him."

I'm a hundred hours deep, and while rewarding is the word, it certainly gets more... I'm not sure. Definitely not less frustrating, or any easier. Certainly not satisfying. I guess you just build up enough hatred towards the game that you keep playing in the hopes that you can show it who's boss. It'll never happen though."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Shgrizz,3,Thu Jul 2 15:51:01 2015 UTC,"True the game never gets an easier, but as a player you just get incrementally better at playing it.   I don't know if there was ever an ""aha"" moment for me when the game clicked. It's been more like a slow and arduous journey of me consistently getting farther (on average).   I do think it gets less frustrating though.   You've seen everything and died in every possible way at a certain point that nothing comes as a surprise. Dying is almost certainly always the player's fault."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Funklord_Earl,3,Thu Jul 2 17:22:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I never really had an 'aha' moment, I just noticed that I was gradually getting further more frequently. Personally though, I find it more frustrating! I used to be able to play this game for 1-3 hours at a time and love it - if I died, I'd just jump right back into the action. Now, I get really pissed off if I get a good thing going and then mess it up, knowing that I could have had an awesome loop build on my hands. I play for about 20-30 minutes at a time, and then have to take a break, even though I'm way better than I used to be.  You're right about dying almost always being the player's fault, with a few exceptions. They're rare now though, thanks to fixed spawns and lil' hunter not being such a monster."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Shgrizz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:17:58 2015 UTC,"I think I've definitely hit an ""aha"" moment recently.  I went from barely being able to reach the labs, let alone getting past big dog, to being able to get to the palace fairly consistently within one sitting.  It was pretty satisfying.

NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,TheLonelyPotato666,2,Fri Jul 3 14:48:36 2015 UTC,Heavy crossbow + bolt marrow or good aim shits on the labs with ease. Just practice aiming through more than one enemy at a time. It's the same with all slow but heavy damage things.
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Extrmeme,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:20:24 2015 UTC,"Meh, I don't know. I can't do the labs with a heavy crossbow if I don't have BM or TF."

I'll still take things like Rabbit Paw over it but the ability to make your own cover on demand is invaluable the later the game goes. You can kill fire traps too as a nice little cherry on top."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Chryscord,2,Thu Jul 2 17:50:33 2015 UTC,I think I would take it more often if it broke a larger amount of walls. Or added some other kind of benefit.
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,KoboldCommando,2,Thu Jul 2 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Being able to create both cover and a really tight chokepoint almost anywhere is incredibly handy and almost impossible to beat, especially if you have the right weapons."

NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,purehatred89,4,Thu Jul 2 17:41:53 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate a little bit? Personally I'd go with Plutonium Hunger or Rabbit Paw.
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,KoboldCommando,8,Thu Jul 2 17:51:15 2015 UTC,"Every kill knocks 40% off the reload time if your weapons. It's invaluable on weapons such as the Super Plasma Cannon, especially with Crown of Blood!"
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,cant_drive,8,Thu Jul 2 18:28:23 2015 UTC,"The biggest point, at least for me, is that it knocks the reload time off of both your weapons.  This is super useful if you have one reliable weapon and another that's slow but situationally awesome, because you don't have to sit there vulnerable and reloading anymore."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Poshul,3,Thu Jul 2 20:08:28 2015 UTC,It works super well with Y.V.'s active.
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,cant_drive,7,Thu Jul 2 19:11:32 2015 UTC,"It makes so many subpar weapons insanely good. Sledgehammer, Energy Sword, and the Double Shotguns are all weapons off the top of my head that become amazing with the mutation.  You don't even have to be using the weapon to reap the benefits; for example if I have a Nuke Launcher and an Auto Crossbow I could fire the Nuke Launcher, switch to Auto Crossbow and nab a few easy kills, then switch back and use the reload reduction to fire the Nuke Launcher again."

What I've noticed with a lot of suggestions is how YV's abilities just make him fit play types you can already get with other characters. I've found my favourite characters often mix things up a bit - add new aspects to the combat. YV doesn't do anything the others can't do.

NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,KoboldCommando,3,Thu Jul 2 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"Even tho I really like robot I think him(it?) and YV are the most boring ones, since their active ablilities aren't that flashy."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,thefirstjoe,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:04:33 2015 UTC,Yes I think him and horror are my two least played characters.
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,TheLonelyPotato666,2,Thu Jul 2 13:02:57 2015 UTC,I think Eyes is one of the best characters.
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,thefirstjoe,2,Fri Jul 3 04:55:52 2015 UTC,"It may well be, I've never learned to play him properly."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,TheLonelyPotato666,3,Thu Jul 2 18:03:18 2015 UTC,I'm gonna make a detailed post soon about the viability of Eyes. I think he's one of the most undervalued mutants.
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Chryscord,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:05:16 2015 UTC,Can you tell me a couple reasons what makes him so good?
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,thefirstjoe,6,Thu Jul 2 18:07:42 2015 UTC,"It's quite possible that he just works well for my playstyle, but here's what works for me:   I typically tend to hold down his active as I run through a level. It allows for an aggressive playstyle, since bullets slow down and tend to avoid you, and enemies group up as well as line up for easier shots. Eyes is AMAZING with melee. My favorite loadout always includes a shovel/ultra shovel with long arms + trigger fingers. As his TK brings all the enemies close to you, you can just swing away. His TK is like having euphoria and a weaker plutonium hunger. It's like 1 1/2 free mutations.   Definitely not for everyone, but I can do pretty damn well with him."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,DaVincitheReptile,3,Thu Jul 2 18:11:21 2015 UTC,"I think the main issue with Eyes is just that he takes a very different mindset.  Bullets avoid you, so often the best way to dodge is to move as little as possible.  Enemies are pulled toward you, so low accuracy/high spread weapons and melee can be really strong defensive options.  And so on.  He turns a lot of the gut reactions you build up on their heads.  It's pretty common for a character or whatever set up like this to be unpopular even when they're quite powerful."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,thefirstjoe,2,Thu Jul 2 18:20:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. He's a very niche character, I just wish more gave him a fair chance. He doesn't get much love here."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Da_Plutonian,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:11:00 2015 UTC,What do you think about his Throne Butt?
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,thefirstjoe,2,Thu Jul 2 20:33:29 2015 UTC,"I never take it. I think it pulls enemies towards you too quickly, it's not worth the extra pushing power for bullets."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,DaVincitheReptile,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:54:18 2015 UTC,Exactly what I think. Vlambeer should add an interesting effect instead of just 'more powerful telekinesis'.
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Xeo_Nespydonum,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:55:55 2015 UTC,"How often do you take Throne Butt, Euphoria, or both?"
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Mecknavorz,3,Sat Jul 4 15:51:02 2015 UTC,"Personally I never take them. They both feel unnecessary and redundant. But to each their own, I'm sure many find them helpful."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,Xeo_Nespydonum,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:26:56 2015 UTC,"Throne butt IMO is not really worth taking, but Euphoria is amazing when you're going survival mode. Looping becomes so damn easy with eyes if you have Euphoria, Rhino Skin, and Second Stomach... you basically can't die."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,drchasedanger,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:32:07 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. Mutations are really subjective, so it's all about personal preference. Bullets don't really cause me trouble (it's contact damage that gets me) so I usually don't bother with it myself."

NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,KoboldCommando,2,Thu Jul 2 23:16:55 2015 UTC,"Extra Feet is my favorite mutation.  Being able to ignore webs and ice is extremely convenient,  the extra speed increases your ability to dodge and increases your offensive capabilities with all weapons, especially shotguns and melee weapons.  Combined with Euphoria it's almost a challenge to get hit in normal situations."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,DaedricAzazel,2,Fri Jul 3 07:24:32 2015 UTC,"I need to try using extra legs with euphoria now, it sound like an interesting combination. Edit: I just tried it, I have a new found respect for extra legs, that was incredible!"

Melee weapons and spammy things are fine but anything like crossbow is a no go."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,TheGr8_potato_Slayer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:51:13 2015 UTC,"I agree about the laser pistol.  I only take it if there's no other good long range weapon.  It only ranks slightly above the revolver for me.  At long range, I'd rather have a crossbow, grenade launcher or assault rifle.  Close up I'd rather have a shotgun, slugger, SMG or pop gun."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,DirkBrickAction,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:44:51 2015 UTC,"I mean, when you find it, probably at 1-1 or 1-2, it's got shit damage, shit fire rate, and almost any weapon is better than it at that point. It even seems to eat up ammo like crazy for some reason."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,TheGr8_potato_Slayer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:14:47 2015 UTC,"Main main issue is that it's only slightly easier to aim than the crossbow, and yet it takes 2+ hits to kill most things.  The ""one and done"" nature of the crossbow just outclasses it in my opinion, because you can shoot something and then be dodging or swapping weapons.  And if you're after spammability the AR is a much better mix between spamming and precision.  It's probably a better boss killer than either of them, but Big Bandit becomes a bit of a pushover after a while unless he pulls some kind of dirty trick."
NuclearThrone,3bv0zo,TwentySharks,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:56:53 2015 UTC,"I love the disc gun, as it does so much damage with no cost to the player"
NuclearThrone,3bzcpf,bitxbit,9,Fri Jul 3 11:09:22 2015 UTC,"[It] makes energy weapons the clear winner in terms of what weapon type to ""gun"" for.   This is hugely debatable. Shot for shot, excluding bullet weapons of course, just about every other weapon type deals more damage than energy weapons, in many cases even with Laser Brain. The main exceptions to this are the energy melee weapons, which have their own tradeoffs and need 2 dedicated mutations to use their full potential.  I love energy weapons to death, but even a basic crossbow with Bolt Marrow is going to serve you better most of the time than, say, a laser rifle with LB.  Other weapons benefit hugely from the utility their mutations bring because they already have the damage or the staying power, while energy weapons have things like penetration, instant hits, and homing, and need the damage in order to stay useful or be viable at all (looking at you, laser cannon).  That said, I don't like it as much as the others (aside from Shotgun Shoulders) even though it's alright as is.  Something I'd love instead is if you could 'charge up' enemies with an energy weapon, and after a few shots or on death it would have some sort of extra effect depending on the type. Laser basically give them Gamma Guts for a second or two, Plasma would hit them with a small plasma explosion, Lightning hits a nearby enemy with an extra lightning rail, etc. I think it'd be more fun instead of straight damage or size."
NuclearThrone,3bzcpf,MaidOfStone,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:07:32 2015 UTC,Whats so bad about shotgun shoulders?
NuclearThrone,3bzcpf,DerpyDoseGamez,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:55:45 2015 UTC,"All it does is make shells bounce a bit further. It does very little to make the shell weapons more viable, and it's definitely the worst weapon specific mutation (except maybe Long Arms)."
NuclearThrone,3bzcpf,Exoskeletal65,5,Fri Jul 3 14:31:15 2015 UTC,"Long arms is great for melee weapons which  are exceptionally useful for dealing with a lot of onscreen projectiles. Shotgun shoulders also doesn't just make them bounce a bit further, after the bounce it resets the distance to do extra damage, as if you fired the shells directly at an enemy while in close proximity"
NuclearThrone,3bzcpf,IamSpaghettiBox,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:37:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's bad, but with the way I use shotguns there's never anything for the shells to bounce off, so I rarely pick it unless I plan on picking up a slugger."
NuclearThrone,3bzcpf,MaidOfStone,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:26:39 2015 UTC,"Shot for shot, excluding bullet weapons of course, just about every other weapon type deals more damage than energy weapons, in many cases even with Laser Brain   Energy weapons also get more ammo than the other 50 bullet limit weapons, so they can get away with not 1 shotting the same things the others do. I really like the effects you've listed as well. The plasma one might be too strong though... Would that only be an on death effect, or would an explosion trigger instantly the moment the projectile contacts an enemy?"
NuclearThrone,3bzcpf,MaidOfStone,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:00:20 2015 UTC,"Probably on death, or maybe only after a plasma orb hits X number of times, so it wouldn't trigger on super low hp enemies. I don't know though, I admittedly don't use plasma weapons that often, so I don't have much of a feel for how powerful they are."

NuclearThrone,3bug2v,Dirst,7,Thu Jul 2 06:25:37 2015 UTC,"That's pretty cool though, since mimics drop so many pickups, and them spawning in a pack is like the game just giving you full ammo and health."
NuclearThrone,3bug2v,V_bob,3,Thu Jul 2 08:01:19 2015 UTC,I think this happened because enemy spawns can sometimes be quadrupled when looping.

NuclearThrone,3butqw,Time_Crusher,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:48:01 2015 UTC,"Wow I like this. Should probably be a multiplicative increase in proc chance rather than additive, since for example a 2% addition to Rabbit Paw would mean +42% drop rate, from 40%, and 2% increase to Bloodlust would be around 9.7%, from 7.7%, a much larger jump.  Maybe something like x1.4 chance for luck mutations to proc. That would mean 92.4% chance for Recycle Gland, maybe making bullet weapons viable lategame (finally)"
NuclearThrone,3butqw,Dirst,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:20:23 2015 UTC,That's even better! it has to be balanced though. i wanted to do 5 % first but i thought with blood lust that would have been too op.

NuclearThrone,3butqw,Cappop,4,Thu Jul 2 19:14:33 2015 UTC,Heavy Minigun.  Double Heavy Minigun.  These weapons must exist.
NuclearThrone,3butqw,Dirst,2,Thu Jul 2 21:18:10 2015 UTC,"This please. I hate having ammo, and want the most efficient way of having 0 bullets."
NuclearThrone,3butqw,nanosheep,3,Fri Jul 3 13:05:59 2015 UTC,Mutation - Heart of Gold  Gold weapons become a rare drop prior to looping.
NuclearThrone,3butqw,nanosheep,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:55:49 2015 UTC,I like that! Would work very well with Robot! Adding this to my list for tomorrow!
NuclearThrone,3butqw,nanosheep,2,Thu Jul 2 20:27:31 2015 UTC,"Pulverizer: Wrench-type melee weapon that uses Explosive ammo to create an explosion where it's swung, far away enough that it won't kill you. Not stolen directly from Killing Floor 2.  Not sure if this is  possible, but a mutation:  Huge Head: 2 active Crowns.  Meaning you can have up to two Crowns active, and picking a third will replace the older one (and picking no crown removes them all). Would be great fun to play with Double Crown of Blood, and other interactions would be nice too. Like ultra-masochist Crown of Risk + Crown of Hatred, to spawn an extra chest and start with 1HP, but opening any chest but medkit will kill you.  Also are you able to make weapons that alter positioning? Some big weapons currently push the player back and melee moves them forward slightly, but nothing major. I want to see a Hookshot utility weapon that uses Bolts to fire, does major damage (30-40), slow reload speed (2 sec maybe), and pulls the player towards the place (or enemy) that is hit."
NuclearThrone,3butqw,Batteryhorse,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:42:40 2015 UTC,I really like the idea of the hookshot. I'll play around a little and see what I can do!
NuclearThrone,3butqw,clockworktwelve,2,Thu Jul 2 14:18:05 2015 UTC,Spontaneous Combustion - Enemies have a 5% chance of exploding when killed  Implosive Ordinance - Explosive push forces are inverted.
NuclearThrone,3butqw,Batteryhorse,2,Thu Jul 2 13:56:07 2015 UTC,So kind of like crown of luck?
NuclearThrone,3butqw,mrhonk123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:06:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with that crown, is it something new?  EDIT: yes it is something new, didn't notice the new update, sorry! I made changes to my original suggestion."
NuclearThrone,3butqw,regenking,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:12:08 2015 UTC,Sounds pretty cool! Give me a little while and I'll get it done!
NuclearThrone,3butqw,TheGr8_potato_Slayer,2,Thu Jul 2 14:18:30 2015 UTC,"Sweet. The idea is that constantly firing explosives at enemies will cause them to group closer together, making them juicier meatier targets. There should be an inherent hidden attribute that causes enemies outside the blast radius to be slightly pushed towards the explosion depending on the damage the explosion does. Now if it also worked with Melting's secondary ability..."
NuclearThrone,3butqw,TheGr8_potato_Slayer,2,Thu Jul 2 14:21:21 2015 UTC,"Inverse weapons! These would reward high skill play by having a higher DPS/DPA than their regular counterparts in exchange for having to aim AWAY from enemies.  Inverse pistol: shoot backwards, bullets deal 3x damage  Inverse shotgun: shoot twice as many pellets backwards for 1 ammo  Inverse laser pistol: Laser brain effect added onto weapon, stacks with regular Laser Brain  Inverse grenade launcher: shoots double grenades backwards for 1 explosive ammo  Inverse wrench: like regular Wrench... BUT BACKWARDS (seriously I have no idea for this one. Lowered cool down?)  Inverse Crossbow: shoots heavy bolts for 1 ammo. (Not sure about whether to include the red line. Up to you!)  Thanks for reading!"
NuclearThrone,3butqw,TheGr8_potato_Slayer,3,Thu Jul 2 17:26:33 2015 UTC,Inverse revolver   Kinda like this?
NuclearThrone,3butqw,TheGr8_potato_Slayer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:20:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but with less suicide. :D"
NuclearThrone,3butqw,TheGr8_potato_Slayer,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:22:02 2015 UTC,bang  splat
NuclearThrone,3butqw,minichibis,2,Fri Jul 3 15:48:25 2015 UTC,"Weapon Idea: The Necromancer's Skull  Ammo Type: Energy  Weapon Effect: On use, you throw a Skull on the ground; after a little while, it activates and starts chasing enemies around with Green Fire and Glowing Eyes. Until you use the attack button again, the Skull will attack on enemies in proximity while draining 3 Energy Per Second.  Damage: 35 Damage (Contact)  Level of Spawn: 5-3"
NuclearThrone,3butqw,mrhonk123,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:05:30 2015 UTC,This one sounds like a lot of fun. I'll give it a shot!
NuclearThrone,3butqw,TheGreenDigi,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:06:46 2015 UTC,Can you change euphoria so that it slows charging ennemies (yetis and such)?
NuclearThrone,3butqw,TheGreenDigi,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:39:40 2015 UTC,I can make it another mutation but it'll seriously mess with the flow of the game...

NuclearThrone,3bthat,shoutsoutstomywrist,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:35:46 2015 UTC,This is awesome.  Also man Crystal is such a dopey looking character.
NuclearThrone,3bvpnl,TheGr8_potato_Slayer,7,Thu Jul 2 15:18:05 2015 UTC,I won't say it's a bad idea but they shouldn't be straight upgrades like your melting or y.v. examples. For example it could be alternative effects like plant's snare has a unique but different function or a balance change that makes it better in one way but less effective in another.  Otherwise you end up with situations like a few character's Ultra mutations where one is clearly better for most purposes than the other and there would be no reason to pick the old skin.
NuclearThrone,3bvpnl,I_RAPE_PCs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:16:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed that was my idea, but balancing isn't really my strong suit so I wrote what I could come up with in a short amount of time, but the idea is to have a slightly different variant of the character with a slightly different throne butt, so a slightly different way to play, to make them worth unlocking and add some playability.  Also you probably shouldn't do that to computers."
NuclearThrone,3bvpnl,RoDDusty,4,Thu Jul 2 17:44:20 2015 UTC,Yeah the B-Skins don't need a benefit to them. They're just gonna be something you can unlock and show off that you unlocked it.
NuclearThrone,3bvpnl,RoDDusty,-9,Thu Jul 2 15:36:11 2015 UTC,Some people don't care about bragging rights and would rather have a different way to play though
NuclearThrone,3bvpnl,RoDDusty,7,Thu Jul 2 15:38:58 2015 UTC,Except what if the skin you really don't like ends up being the 'best' way to play that character? I really never want to play as plant's b-skin but if it gives him the best throne butt then I kinda have to if I want a good ranking on a daily.
NuclearThrone,3bvpnl,RoDDusty,-5,Thu Jul 2 15:57:44 2015 UTC,"That will give you a reason to unlock him, which is the point, if you really don't like the skin but like the ability that's a whole other problem that depends on you, I personaly would play him even if I don't like the skin."
NuclearThrone,3bvpnl,RoDDusty,4,Thu Jul 2 16:08:13 2015 UTC,"Why does there have to be a point to unlocking things besides 'Hey, I have this now', out of curiosity?"
NuclearThrone,3bvpnl,Nommiin,-4,Thu Jul 2 16:19:03 2015 UTC,"Because if unlocking them is a complicated task some people might not care about ""hey I have this now"" it's like playing as the lost in BoI for no reason whatsoever, I mean who would bother unlocking plant's ugly ass B-skin?"
NuclearThrone,3bvpnl,damimp,2,Thu Jul 2 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"So you're basing the whole 'b-skins need a gameplay effect' on your assumption that they'll be difficult to unlock?  What if they're really 'easy' to unlock, like just visiting the corresponding secret area? Now, based on your examples, you've got a huge buff to a character for very little effort."

NuclearThrone,3bpxq8,Mate9,5,Wed Jul 1 07:08:37 2015 UTC,Boiling veins is good mutation as long as lil' hunter lives.

NuclearThrone,3bpxq8,InvalidGnome,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:47:19 2015 UTC,Probably because of melting's (and also chicken's) ability to have only 1 health. You wouldn't be able to have half health and then the mutation would be useless.

Seriously though, good ideas, I don't really like the Paradox one because I feel like flames would fit more than explosions, but whatever. This is a genuinely good idea, and the fact that it is the proto mutant and fits the proto mutant too just makes it kinda awesome. Seems like an hard but rewarding character with a really high skill ceiling, just what it needs to be my favourite and to not be removed by devs ""because it fucks up the speed of the game"" at the same time.  (I'll probably mod it in in some later versions when modding becomes less of a disaster than it is now)"

NuclearThrone,3bk9gf,CryoCrisis,5,Tue Jun 30 00:32:58 2015 UTC,"Nice design concept, but balancing needs so much work.  First off, ""2 less damage with every weapon"" means pellet weapons do zero damage, which is dumb. Damage bonus/reduction currently isn't really a thing in Nuclear Throne because all projectile types have the same set damage (shotgun pellets do the same damage as flak cannon pellets (2), revolver bullets do the same as minigun (3), etc), so it's tough to implement properly, but if anything, percentage based reduction/buffs would work better.  Otherwise, make part of the passive to give all enemies 30-50% more max HP (reverse Scarier Face), and make the clone do extra damage with all projectile types to make it simpler.  Also, Throne Butt is super broken. Anything that doesn't oneshot you cannot damage you, every 5 seconds.  Another thing, Vlambeer have said part of their intention was to make all actives have no cooldown, and design them to that they can be used as much as needed, but aren't always worth using (you can spam Horror beam as long as you have rads, but you usually don't want to). So the 5 second cooldown thing goes against that a bit.  Also, how would the flashback predict player movement with Ultra B...  Still though, I'd play it."
NuclearThrone,3bk9gf,Dirst,3,Tue Jun 30 04:05:39 2015 UTC,"To add to this, it completely negates health as a mechanic.  Both the throne butt and the ultra translate to ""if you're alive, you should be at full health.""  Add in Strong Spirit and it's gg loop517.  That's not fun and kind of ridiculously too-good, whether or not your damage output is nerfed.  Take a sledgehammer or something and you'll be fine."
NuclearThrone,3bk9gf,CryoCrisis,3,Tue Jun 30 06:31:35 2015 UTC,Are you saying pellets don't do zero damage?
NuclearThrone,3bk9gf,xAlfafllfflx,3,Tue Jun 30 09:16:59 2015 UTC,...Yeah I'm kinda saying that I guess. Pellets are great.

NuclearThrone,3bk9gf,Xeo_Nespydonum,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:19:21 2015 UTC,Horror is easily the most powerful character in NT atm with a very low skill floor/medium skill ceiling (This means that anyone can pick him up and be good with him with minimal practice as opposed to playing someone like Melting) and the devs don't want everyone just using one mutant out of all the others to choose from.

One poster suggested that, while the player character became a rootin' tootin' bandit-shootin' killer, all the rest of the mutants were only left with a revolver to defend themselves. As a result, the IDPD preemptively raided the campfire and killed the player's friends, in order to prevent the entire group from finding the Throne and threatening their dimension.    The solution, of course, is for Vlambeer to implement 12-person co-op."

The campfire level is the equivalent of the selection screen for a dimension in which throne 2 had already killed everyone because this is a dimension in which you weren't there to save the day. As a result of the throne's victory all of the levels are much harder.   Basically, after you save your dimension you save other dimensions that didn't have you to save them."

They both got stuck halfway and fused together. They now share minds and refer to each other as brother and sister.     Appeance: You can only see half of Split. Split is squat, yellowish and has eye stalks.  Example sprite     and    Example filling in the missing half     Passive: Split is small  Split has roughly half the hitbox size of other characters, but suffers a range debuff for melee and even a slight range debuff for ranged weapons.     Active: Project your other half  Using your active causes Split's other half to appear (it's dark yellow and transparent) and run in the direction you were going when you clicked. It cannot stop or change directions and is slightly faster than Split (stacks with Extra Feet) . While Split's other half is out, all weapons are fired from him instead of you! Split's other half is also immune to damage, but will disappear when he reaches a certain distance from Split. Enemies do not target Split's other half.     Throne Butt:  Enemies now attack Split's other half, drawing away enemy fire.     Ultra A: Gun Dimension  Split's other half can pick up weapons with E and use them independently of Split. (Not so sure about this one, it's cool in theory but too complicated)     Ultra B: Tandem Attacks  Split attacks at the same time as Split's other half.          And just because I like loading screen tips:  Loading text:   Split loves her brother Split's sister is annoying Split's brother is invisible Feeling hollow Feeling solid Together forever Half the world is dark Split's brother comes from far away Split is an amateur chef Too many cooks Split is eating for two So hungry...

B-SKIN: Hobo has green furry skin and hops around in a trash can, a reference to Oscar the Grouch from the Elmo TV series.  Backstory: Hobo was a homeless man living on the streets and surviving off of the stuff he found in trash cans. Once the apocalypse came, he was hiding out in a dumpster and preparing for his luxurious (disgusting) meal, and the dumpster was frozen shut. He pounded against the dumpster in vain, trapped underneath a huge pile of snow. The long exposure to the radiation gave him drill-like claws that allowed him to dig out, and once he opened up, he found the Frozen City.

Cacti, Toxic Barrels, Crystals, etc.) Hiding in a freak tube will quickly kill you. You cannot hide in rad canisters or the proto statue.

NuclearThrone,3bj8vi,clockworktwelve,2,Tue Jun 30 03:23:14 2015 UTC,"Well I mean... there's Big Bandit, Ballmum, Big Dog, the giant crystal, Lil Hunter, the Technomancer, and the Throne. I can't imagine that a flying crystal or a throne can really communicate with anything, and the Technomancer turning people into necromancers probably doesn't make him too many friends. I don't even know what Ballmum is."
NuclearThrone,3bj8vi,Jerln,4,Mon Jun 29 18:46:49 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that Lil' Hunter is also a gibbering maniac, which would probably make it hard for him to make friends."
NuclearThrone,3bj8vi,Dancing_Anatolia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:32:19 2015 UTC,"At least he's got Lil Gunther by his side, the only person in the wastelands who can really (and literally) understand him"

NuclearThrone,3big4y,Problematicar,2,Mon Jun 29 14:17:25 2015 UTC,"Same thing has happened to me. It's almost WORSE as Chicken because you just have to hopelessly watch your character bleed out instead of dying instantly.    Always try to be REALLY aware of your start when 7-3 starts, usually you can avoid the random projectiles, but sometimes it's really rough haha"
NuclearThrone,3big4y,SwordSaint892,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:55:34 2015 UTC,How are you at Throne at a loop but don't have an Ultra mutation?
NuclearThrone,3big4y,TehBossaru,6,Mon Jun 29 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"He did have an ultra mutation, the death screen just cuts off some of the mutation list for some reason."
NuclearThrone,3big4y,Dramlx,-2,Mon Jun 29 17:15:07 2015 UTC,well obviously not because you opened both the chests...
NuclearThrone,3big4y,zanderthedestroyer,3,Mon Jun 29 19:34:56 2015 UTC,What does opening the chests do to harm me?
NuclearThrone,3big4y,Gjones18,3,Mon Jun 29 19:55:46 2015 UTC,He was Chicken so he could run around headless for a little while. He's on 7-3 so there aren't any enemies that can spawn besides the throne itself and there's definitely no way to run across the map to spawn him and hope he drops a medkit
NuclearThrone,3bjd6c,DerpyDoseGamez,9,Mon Jun 29 18:27:24 2015 UTC,"Weapons reload by percentage, going from 0% to 100%.  Once a weapon is at 100% reload, you can fire it again.  Whenever you get a kill while you have Trigger Fingers, it automatically adds 40% to the current reload percentage.  It only affects your current reload.    This means a slow reloading weapon like Heavy Crossbow gains more benefit than a fast firing weapon like the Minigun, because a larger amount of time was cut from the reload.  It also  can proc multiple times during a single reload period, so getting two kills during one reload period will add 80%, and three kills guarantee bringing it to 100%.  If you're a numbers person, I'll use the Heavy Crossbow again as an example.  Ordinarily, its reload time takes 1.33 seconds to reload.  Getting a kill with Trigger Fingers will add 40% to its reload percentage, reducing reload time by .53 seconds (1.33 * .4).  Thus it will only take .8 seconds (1.33 - [1.33 * .4]) to fire again.  The next reload is not affected and will take 1.33 seconds unless you get a kill."
NuclearThrone,3bjd6c,damimp,6,Mon Jun 29 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"To add to this, if your secondary weapon isn't reloaded (=ready to shoot), it gets 40 % reload too."
NuclearThrone,3bjd6c,TheLonelyPotato666,-1,Mon Jun 29 18:50:09 2015 UTC,"Ah okay, that seems pretty not so useful"
NuclearThrone,3bjd6c,JD_Slidemaster,8,Mon Jun 29 19:03:06 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely fantastic, but it's obviously situational. It makes the shovel and the sledgehammer, two high damage super early game melee weapons, viable way into the games, making them labs and even palace worthy.  it makes heavy crossbow imbalaned.  It also does next to nothing for autoweapons.   So it's more than pretty not so useful, but it's not a mutation you should pick every run either.  HF with the throne :)"
NuclearThrone,3bjd6c,Epidemilk,4,Mon Jun 29 19:12:17 2015 UTC,Im to bad to get to the throne :(
NuclearThrone,3bjd6c,Gjones18,2,Mon Jun 29 19:13:12 2015 UTC,You're not alone. I can only get to 5-3 on a good run
NuclearThrone,3bjd6c,QTheNew42Q,4,Mon Jun 29 21:50:16 2015 UTC,"To add on to his Heavy Crossbow example, if you get Bolt Marrow to go with your Trigger Fingers and have some smart shot placement you can easily get 2-3 kills per shot allowing you to fire again pretty much immediately, basically upgrading your Heavy Crossbow to an Auto Heavy Crossbow without the drawback of reduced accuracy.     Overall it's kinda worthless with anything that fires quickly/is automatic and invaluable for weapons that can be too slow to help you in the late-game but are really good otherwise. It's also mandatory if you ever want to try the Fish + Gun Warrant + Super Plasma Cannon build for this nonsense."

NuclearThrone,3bg5sa,Gjones18,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:55:02 2015 UTC,"The only reason people just use it after all the other mutations are gained is because the current trade off is bullshit, being limited to 1 single choice of mutation for the remainder of your levels is completely stupid. They should've just left it as is until they had a full fix for it, because it went from being helpful after you max (and even then you had to hope to get something that would actually help you) to something that will rarely benefit you (the only time its useful is still in the exact same situation, when you find it after you've made Ultra, only it'll show up rarely at that point). Gaining one extra mutation is never worth losing the choice for the remaining 3-4+ mutations you might still have yet to reach + your Ultra :/"

NuclearThrone,3bgkdd,foxesOSGN,3,Mon Jun 29 02:23:14 2015 UTC,"The challenge got me. The game is hard... so every little bit of progress feels rewarding. First, Big Dog. Then the Caves. Then Lil Hunter. Then the Palace. Then the Throne. Then you get your first loop. Then your second. Then your third. It just feels so rewarding."
NuclearThrone,3bgkdd,IshThe2nd,3,Mon Jun 29 13:41:29 2015 UTC,"That feeling when you are being shot at by so many things and you blow off all your ammo to survive, you dodge so many bullets and lose strong spirit 3 times, but survive because of rabbits paw and second stomach.  It's this state of zen where you do everything right and it's amazing."

NuclearThrone,3bh10v,GameForDaysYT,2,Mon Jun 29 03:47:04 2015 UTC,"A little late for my story, but here goes:  I was about 25 hours into Nuclear Throne when I finally looped. I had watched NL and Sleepcycles play quite a bit, and was getting better myself. My favorite character is Rebel, because her allies are amazing when you have throne butt.  My first loop (after dying to the throne about 6 times in the previous 25 hours) came during a Rebel run where I got almost NONE of the mutations I wanted. No throne butt, no second stomach, no plutonium hunger. And yet I made it to 3-3 in the loop.  Still haven't looped again though lol"
NuclearThrone,3bh10v,2bQuiteFrank,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:43:21 2015 UTC,"I looped for the first time after 35 hours with Plant. It was weird, I'd made it to the throne like two or three times before, but most of my runs at this point were ending at the scrapyard or even earlier. I remember not even having that good of weapons, yet somehow ended up killing the throne."
NuclearThrone,3bh10v,rewindthegamer,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:53:38 2015 UTC,"I think I hit my first loop around 50 hours, though the actual progress I made varied. The first time I technically looped, I died on the IDPD raid BEFORE the second phase, which was a buzzkill. Then I got past that part and onto the second phase before touching the boss by accident and dying. Some time after those two, I finally managed to get smart and keep my distance and finally looped. I think I died on 1-2 L1 due to sheer hype.  All as Plant, by the way."
NuclearThrone,3bh10v,AbsoluTeField,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:33:41 2015 UTC,"My first loop came after about 40 hours of gameplay. Like you, I was Crystal -and though I made it pat phase two I also ran out of ammo and died after about 5 seconds of my first full loop.  My best loop ever came after about 80 hours (I'm on about 85 atm, so fairly recent) - with Plant. I got to 4-1 on my 2nd loop (beating the throne twice). I can just about remember my build - I had a scarier face/throne butt combo. 2nd stomach, rhino skin, strong spirit, plutonium hunger, back muscle, bolt marrow, gamma guts and rabbit paw (gained through crown of destiny) (mutations not necessarily gained in that order). I picked the sapling ultra and found an auto heavy crossbow. Hilarity ensued. I don't even remember my secondary, I don't think I switched out once (rabbit paw and plut hung doing their thing for ammo). Get a build like that and you can walk it.  On a side note - the only character I have never looped with is Melting, but Melting was the first character I ever got to the Palace with.  Anyway, that's my story!"
NuclearThrone,3bh10v,SMJ2893,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:56:15 2015 UTC,"My first loop was 20-25 hours in and i got to throne as rebel and beat it, killed second throne with no ammo left, and died to a kamikaze plant. After that i can only get to throne as rebel since her passive is too helpful."
NuclearThrone,3bh10v,ChainOfDeath,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:41:18 2015 UTC,I was YV and got to level ultra so I went to YV's Crib and almost killed myself exploding the cars. Then Went to YV's Mansion and died  Skipped 0-1
NuclearThrone,3bh10v,stewartisme,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:52:47 2015 UTC,Wow. Seeing all these people who have looped after 20-50 hours in is kind of embarrassing. Thanks for not making fun of me!
NuclearThrone,3bh10v,Fleshmaster,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:09:28 2015 UTC,"I looped at 85, so I'm up there too.  Crystal was also my first loop, but it was like the floodgates broke after I finally did it.  I've looped now with every character except Rebel and Melting, twice or more with most other characters."

NuclearThrone,3bfyyk,bllqbird,7,Sun Jun 28 21:56:43 2015 UTC,"Pretty nice idea, and gives me an idea too. I'd like to see a sort of ""ultimate mutant"" boss that can use the abilities of all the current mutants. Shooting snares, dodge rolling around, making allies whose corpses it can explode, shielding, etc."
NuclearThrone,3bfyyk,Dirst,3,Sun Jun 28 23:05:30 2015 UTC,That could've been the Labs boss.
NuclearThrone,3bfyyk,Dancing_Anatolia,2,Mon Jun 29 03:38:32 2015 UTC,"I think it would actually be a really fun boss fight. There would be so many things to keep track of, and if implemented well and in a way that the hazards are clearly indicated, it would be great fun dodging it all."
NuclearThrone,3bfyyk,Dirst,0,Mon Jun 29 04:11:38 2015 UTC,This should be in the IDPD level they might add. An IdPD agent who spied on the mutants for a long time and mastered all their moves.
NuclearThrone,3bfyyk,TheLonelyPotato666,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:26:04 2015 UTC,"As always this is super fun to imagine in the game itself. Even the concept of a 1v1 boss is only used once in the form of the Throne, and as a boss it's currently woefully straightforward. Meanwhile this boss sounds really fun to fight (Smash ability aside, why would you hate on the melee users like that)  The Crowns sounds like a cool thing for her to do but how would you clearly telegraph to the player what they did? ESPECIALLY the first and third ones? (Two and four, if the crowns being summoned was made apparent, would work fine imo.)  Why does she have to be related to Eyes though?  And if you don't have the first boss fight from Gun Godz as at least one of the YV's Mansion ideas I will be disappointed."
NuclearThrone,3bfyyk,TalixZero,2,Mon Jun 29 04:41:33 2015 UTC,I think you'll be glad at who (or rather what) the boss will be.

I don't think this is smart, especially in a pretty small sub like this one. The main reason being, I don't want to downvote content I don't want to see. I feel bad when I do, so I don't. I upvote content I like, but that means people who actively downvote have twice as much impact on the outcome than I do, and that doesn't feel right to me.  I dunno if this is coherent, I haven't slept in a while. but point made maybe."
NuclearThrone,3bbicz,jetio4,2,Sun Jun 28 09:46:27 2015 UTC,I vote for a weekly thread too.  The problem is that there are like 5 death screens for 1 other post. It's becoming too much.

NuclearThrone,3b9e1k,QTheNew42Q,3,Sat Jun 27 15:26:15 2015 UTC,"Oh man, OP is really getting slammed for his opinion. As someone else stated, I remember on the /r/bindingofisaac/ subreddit a huge amount of Eden start pics or pictures of an item pedestal of a rare item during a challenge run (because it wouldn't count towards completion) clogging up the subreddit. This game is getting more and more popular everyday and this can eventually be a real problem. And the suggestions of a weekly thread/megathread aren't too bad. I think the beast needs to be contained before it becomes an issue because it will at some point."
NuclearThrone,3b9e1k,TheMehr,15,Sat Jun 27 15:55:35 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree.  My reason being, I want to keep this a friendly community for everyone, especially newbies. And the best way to do that is to let them share their successes.  How would Kerbal Space Program's community be if they shunned pictures of Mün landings? It would be much smaller for starters because they'd effectively be turning away new players, and it wouldn't have the super friendly reputation that it has.  First wins are a massive achievement in Nuclear Throne. Remember your first Throne kill? How did you feel? Did you want to share that feeling? Would you like it if you were told to stop posting your stupid death screens because we get a few of them a day?  I mean, it's not like there are 20 on the front page all the time blocking everything else out."
NuclearThrone,3b9e1k,buster2Xk,10,Sat Jun 27 04:52:52 2015 UTC,"Personally, when I first killed the throne/looped, I was proud but I didn't feel like I needed to share it with a community of strangers. It's something I cared about, but I knew others wouldn't, since that's simply my personal accomplishment.   You hold a fair point with Kerbal Space Program. Still, I don't feel that this would necessarily shun new players. I feel like threads containing helpful tips and strategies would be much more welcoming and helpful than a subreddit full of ""look how well I did!"""
NuclearThrone,3b9e1k,DocTavia,3,Sat Jun 27 05:20:50 2015 UTC,"Your feelings about how you decide to share your achievements shouldn't reflect the subreddit policies.

Nuclear Throne is a game, people play it to have fun, and feel good about improvement.

NuclearThrone,3b7e0a,nanosheep,3,Sat Jun 27 00:08:25 2015 UTC,...I need to implement a melee weapon that spawns a ball that doubles in speed everytime you hit it now.  It needs to happen.
NuclearThrone,3b7e0a,TheGreenDigi,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:11:12 2015 UTC,"Make it an energy weapon (Energy Bat?). First click spawns/hits a small/big plasma ball. The rest goes as standard.  I think the hardest part for this would be making it so the ball has permanence long enough for it to be relevant to continue to hit it. And that you only spawn one at a time (Unless you don't want it to be limited like that.) Another potential difficulty, should you pursue it, is have the bat swing use less energy while the spawn + swing uses more."
NuclearThrone,3b7e0a,RoDDusty,2,Sat Jun 27 07:35:39 2015 UTC,"In line with this weapon's theme, a black hole vortex cannon should be implemented!  Sucks everything in, everything sucked dies."

If you're used to keyboard, it can be hard at first but it's very responsive, you just have to treat it differently than a mouse and keyboard. Aiming with the gamepad doesn't allow you to aim on the enemy, but in their direction and you get used to that. Otherwise I totally agree, showing the game in a poor light, and they obviously aren't doing it intentionally."

Personally I think those are great choices.  2) Auto-Crossbow is great for the throne. You'll want to keep that, especially with bolt marrow, as it can really help you post-loop. The smart gun was more the problem; it really lacks the DPS you'll need to fight the throne. You'll learn as you go on to get a sense of what weapons are better throne killers. Also, keep it in the back of your mind while in the palace to be conscious of your ammo while tackling the palace guardians, it's easy to finish 7_2 and suddenly realize you're out of bolts.

NuclearThrone,3b8cn5,Lucky1291,2,Fri Jun 26 21:28:25 2015 UTC,Do you know any good free video editing software? Real life sometimes gets in the way and it is just a paused screen for a few minutes :P
NuclearThrone,3b8cn5,Latimew333,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:08:06 2015 UTC,Uh... I mean. Windows base software seems to work OK if you're just gonna cut out some parts of a video.   Youtube's video editor seems OK too.  Other than that I don't really know of any free video editing software. Sorry. The videos I do I usually do in one take so they don't require any editing
NuclearThrone,3b8dxk,sjschmidt93,3,Fri Jun 26 20:14:23 2015 UTC,One thing I would recommend doing is taking the Hammerhead mutation before reaching 5-3. It allows you to break walls which you can use to make cover for yourself which can protect you from lil hunter's bullets.
NuclearThrone,3b8dxk,Aldahe,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:37:12 2015 UTC,"If you spawn in a safe area, great! All you have to do is walk around a little and wait for Lil' hunter to drop down. There will be a shadow on the ground where he will drop. Usually it's right on top of you.  If you get a bad spawn, clear it out real quick and find the safest area to bait Lil' Hunter out.   When he drops try to burst him down as fast as you can so he doesn't have time to be a pain in the dick."
NuclearThrone,3b8dxk,Krognol,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:32:10 2015 UTC,"Alright, i will just try to sum this up:  *Lil' hunter spawns after 5-8 seconds of entering 5-3.  *If your spawn is a box leading to a huge hallways, you are pretty much screwed.  *If you have hammer head, don't waste thoose seconds to create cover! He will either way destroy it, and by that time you could clear the next area so you can move around more!  *Homing weapons are the best against Lil' hunter. You can shoot at him without going out from cover!  *IDPD will CONSTANTLY SPAWN. Make sure you are prepared to fight Shielders and grunts!  *Lil' Hunter after being killed, will start flying around, then explode. Make sure you hide!  *Getting Boiling veins and being on 4 HP will 100% guarantee that Lil' hunters explosions and fires will NOT kill you. His kamikaze death will also not.  *[NOT SURE YET] If you kill Lil' Hunter with an explosive weapon, he will explode instantly.  *Lil' Hunter CAN harm IDPD! Use that to your advantage!  *When Lil' hunter shoots Red Pez/PSPs, hitting it back with a melee weapon is great! It can deal alot of damage and kill IDPD!  That's pretty much it for me."
NuclearThrone,3b8dxk,Akosss,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:01:45 2015 UTC,"Boiling veins would help, crystal's shield ability helps with dealing with him as well, but in general I've found as soon as he lands just never stop shooting him (helps to have a spammy weapon here) My first little hunter kill was with crystal due to the shielding ability, he's always a pain in the ass"
NuclearThrone,3b8dxk,Lucky1291,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:30:05 2015 UTC,"crystal makes little hunter easy, especially after the update. just have any good burst damage weapon and shield as necessary (don't get throne butt)"
NuclearThrone,3b8dxk,burningsensation,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"Along with the commonly used tips, DON'T PANIC! I used to panic all the time and I died more often than not to Little Hunter, even when clearing the way and having good weapons. Once however, I reminded myself to stay calm and I somehow killed him in a bad spawn with only a flame shotgun and a shovel."
NuclearThrone,3b8dxk,Chubbabelly,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:49:35 2015 UTC,"Nah, when I get there I just spam the fuck out of everything and usually do fine."
NuclearThrone,3b8dxk,manfartwish,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:06:15 2015 UTC,"My advice is to take your time. You need to instantly take cover when Lil Hunter comes down, you will most likely be able to shoot only once, but if you do it enough times it will kill him."
NuclearThrone,3b8dxk,_Jogger_,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:58:54 2015 UTC,"Watch for his shadow! If you see a shadow appear, get out of the way before that fucker drops down, and prepare to shoot whatever you've got in that direction."

NuclearThrone,3b4sub,Hypnodick,5,Thu Jun 25 23:42:21 2015 UTC,"Individual levels will be easier, yes, but bosses' difficulty will progress at the same speed. I always get fucked by triple BB on loop 2, taking CoB, although making things more difficult, will allow me to get more kills before I reach this BB wall.  OP has a fantastic username too."
NuclearThrone,3b4sub,SpyroAlmighty,2,Thu Jun 25 23:56:48 2015 UTC,"It's honestly a trade off. You will loop further if you don't take it, but bosses get continually more difficult and you'll have more IDPD spawning on higher loops. The throne fight especially on loop 5+ gets REALLY painful, even with back muscle and full ammo you won't be able to kill it without switching weapons or farming the glowing balls. This is a big reason I try taking crown of blood, it also means I don't have to play for as long, which is nice.  For reference, I've noted that getting to loop 5 without CoB gets me about ~5k kills while getting to loop 4 with it gets me about ~6k kills.   I'd be interested to know if the players getting 10k+ kills took it though."
NuclearThrone,3b4sub,toxicbox,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:15:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty balanced between wanting to get lots of kills before bosses become unkillable, and reliably getting to those bosses.  Personally I take it because I get bored fast post-loop and want more things to kill."
NuclearThrone,3b4sub,Dirst,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:40:36 2015 UTC,"1-3k is a rather big range. My all-time best daily is 4819 (5-19). Done without CoB. Until today (2397 kills) I've never taken crown of blood on a daily. My top 10 average is 2002. I place top 20 about 3x a week. I don't consider myself a particulary great player. Think about the perfect CoB mutation setup... on a non crown of blood run. You'll do well don't you think? Can you score 10k? No. 4-5k? Yes. Folks like Azite, Krinku, Squire, etc distort what a good run is a little bit. I will never get 8000+ and I doubt .01% of NT players ever will. My goal is to simply make 3k consistent with or without CoB."
NuclearThrone,3b2uab,Time_Crusher,13,Thu Jun 25 14:52:53 2015 UTC,"Which also means they're reworking YV's Crappy Ultra in some way, since the Ultra Ammochest is in the crib. Hopefully they let you revisit it every once in a while for ammo."
NuclearThrone,3b2uab,Dirst,9,Thu Jun 25 15:10:29 2015 UTC,The Ultra ammo chest shows up in the crib instead of the weapons chest if you have Crown of Love on
NuclearThrone,3b2uab,TalixZero,3,Thu Jun 25 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"Oh... So it's basically a nerf, since the weapon chests would give you full ammo most of the time anyway."
NuclearThrone,3b2uab,Dirst,5,Thu Jun 25 16:02:17 2015 UTC,"No, it's a buff. If you ever went Back 2 Bizniz with Crown of Love you'd only get 2 rinky-dink normal ammo chests. Now you get 2 ultra ammo chests."
NuclearThrone,3b2uab,Psychopath12,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:43:45 2015 UTC,"He's saying it's worse than not having Crown of Love, because you'll almost assuredly get full ammo from all of the weapons."
NuclearThrone,3b2uab,Dancing_Anatolia,-1,Thu Jun 25 21:11:30 2015 UTC,I don't get why people think it's a bad Ultra. Is a huge ammo resupply and a choice of whatever weapons you want a bad thing?
NuclearThrone,3b2uab,wow75,2,Thu Jun 25 20:59:20 2015 UTC,"It's because it's not a permanent thing, like why people hate Last Wish. And even less reload time can get you some crazy DPS."
NuclearThrone,3b2uab,Dancing_Anatolia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"Do the weapons not count as permanent? When I'm watching people deep in loops on the daily, they tend to stay with the same weapons as long as possible until they are running out of ammo. Wouldn't getting at least one of those weapons with around full ammo be worth it, especially starting into post-loop levels?"
NuclearThrone,3b2uab,wow75,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:28:43 2015 UTC,"Eventually you'll run out of the ammo you got, and you might want to change weapons eventually. So it can be partially permanent, but only if you decide to make the weapons permanent."
NuclearThrone,3b2uab,Dancing_Anatolia,-2,Thu Jun 25 21:32:18 2015 UTC,"What about his other Ultra then? With a faster fire rate and no ammo boost, you would run out of ammo way faster, and though your DPS would go up, your total damage wouldn't. Getting a good loop weapon with plenty of ammo seems just as good as firing a weapon faster in loop, if not better."
NuclearThrone,3b2uab,wow75,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:52:21 2015 UTC,"DPS is direct damage. The more you Damage per Second increases, the more damage you do, and lessens the time to kill enemies. Also, it's ridiculously fun."
NuclearThrone,3b2uab,Dancing_Anatolia,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:39:20 2015 UTC,"I'd consider them permanent, since ideally you find the weapon combo you wanted and stick with it for the rest of the run. The thing is, you could just get the other Ultra and pick up the weapons normally during the run. I've never been in a situation where I'd give up the faster fire rate on my potential endgame weapons than immediately have those weapons. Sort of a ""decent thing now or possibly amazing thing later"" deal."
NuclearThrone,3b2uab,Dirst,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:12:18 2015 UTC,"Always wanted for big ammo chest. And maybe Y.V. crib needs 1 ultra ammo,and 1 ultra weapon chests?"

NuclearThrone,3b2uab,Fluury,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:47:44 2015 UTC,Really like the big ammo chest idea but not sure how the ultra ammochest is gonna work with Y.V's ultra because the huge golden weapon chests already give you max ammo by walking over the weapons.

NuclearThrone,3azrux,RoDDusty,11,Wed Jun 24 21:27:22 2015 UTC,"The way GM works is that games more or less HAVE to be framerate dependent. It sucks but that's the way it works.  There are ways around it, I assume, but nothing I am personally aware of."
NuclearThrone,3azrux,Yanthir,3,Wed Jun 24 21:36:27 2015 UTC,That is the first argument I've heard against making games in GM. huh
NuclearThrone,3azrux,RoDDusty,7,Wed Jun 24 21:40:33 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad way to make games but it's also got it's own faults.  For example, GM has practically ruined me for actual coding. Everything is so easy in GM that I have to learn how to make the things that made it easy. Which isn't easy, at least for me.  It all depends on what you want your game to be, simple 'little' things like Nuclear Throne work great, but something more intense with more on screen clutter wouldn't work quite as well unless things were optimized to a T. Or you buy that expensive special compiler Yoyo released for GM:S."
NuclearThrone,3azrux,oposdeo,2,Wed Jun 24 21:44:43 2015 UTC,"The typical way around it is delta timing  It is very effective and allows you to make anything non-FPS-dependent. The problem is, like kbjwes77 said, this is the kind of thing you implement from day 1; It would take a long time to add it in now. It also makes the game a bit harder to code since you aren't in control of the frame-rate."

NuclearThrone,3azrux,Naso,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:59:16 2015 UTC,"As a fellow gamemaker-user, with a curiosity related to adding NT-style walls to his own project, how did you go about optimizing them?  Because the ones I tried implementing cause my game to lag like hell."
NuclearThrone,3azrux,ledraps,2,Fri Jun 26 02:46:50 2015 UTC,"Since that part of the code is my own, and is a completely new system not found in NT's source, I believe I have the right to share details of that. Basically, to generate the world, I place floor tiles (literally tiles, not objects) to lay out the map. Then I go through, and create walls (the walls are objects, not tiles) directly adjacent to any floor tiles, but not over top any existing tiles or walls. Then I repeat the process to make the walls double thick, mostly for asthetic purposes, but also a neat side effect is to catch any projectiles going fast enough to clip through the first set of walls.  Now that the world is generated, you are entitled to blow shit up. By entitled, I mean encouraged. So, back to the game. When an explosive hits a wall, it tells that wall to destroy itself, and place walls surrounding it (again, not placing walls over top any existing walls or floor tiles). The trick I used involved two optimization steps:  Walls must update their image_index and other variables to 'auto-tile' correctly. Instead of telling EVERY instance of obj_wall to re-calculate its image_index and stuff, I do a quick check to see if it is in the immediate vicinity of the most recent explosion/wall destructor. This culls the number of checks drastically, and reduces the calculation to potentially a single point_in_rectangle() check versus 20-24 position_meeting() checks. That's the major and first trick.  Secondly, before a wall actually destroys itself, I use its image_index to do something really sneaky. Because the image_index of the wall is an indicator of the walls surrounding it (or not, empty spaces effect the wall's image_index as well), I can use that instead of a position_meeting() check for the surrounding 4 walls. If its image_index is a specific value, I can even skip those 4 position_meeting() checks altogether, because the wall already checked previously and found floor tiles around it, so it could never place walls next to itself based on the destruction system.  So it took a little creativity and thinking outside the box but it really speeds things up. It went from a noticeable hiccup to a tiny temporary hogging of the CPU that lasts less than a frame in most cases. I'd say it's at least 4 times faster than the current system in the official game. Anyways, hope that helps!"

Fish gets a bonus to ammo and his roll gives you some extra maneuverability for tricky situations and closing up gaps. Crystal gets bonus health and can shield up against the trickier bullet hell portions.  Mutations are a bit trickier. You're going to have to get used to picking through them, but I'd get used to picking the following really highly: Rhino skin, bloodthirst, second stomach, rabbit's paw, open mind, boiling veins. The rest are largely dependent on your build and resources situation. (For instance, weapon specific mutations can be really really good, but might also be useless, obviously)  For weapons, nearly every weapon is viable in its own way. It's all about sorting through their power and ammo efficiency (For instance, minigun: super powerful, extremely inefficient) . There's some all-stars that can really help you out like the flak cannon, but you really do have to get used to using a wide variety."
NuclearThrone,3ay6ce,Lancer873,6,Wed Jun 24 13:36:22 2015 UTC,i think rabbit's paw is the best mutation

Personally, I rate mutations in tiers of how important or useful I find them.  Tier 1: scarier face, plutonium hunger, rabbit paw, and back muscle.  Tier 2: Bloodlust, lucky shots, rhino skin, second stomach, and maybe trigger fingers for the big guns on loops.  Tier 3: the weapon specialty mutations, eagle eyes.  Some mutations are definitely based on the character I am using though. I don't take rhino skin with melting. Back muscle is less important for me with Fish, Plant, and Rebel.   Throne butt especially depends on the character: fish=no, crystal=no, plant=tier 1, melting=tier 2, y.v.=no, robot=? (I don't play robot), steroids=tier 1, rebel= tier 1, chicken=? (I haven't played her enough since 'the change'), horror=meh tier 3, rogue=tier 2, eyes= depends on which ultra I will use no for A, and tier 3 for B.

NuclearThrone,3ay6ce,1D13,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:08:46 2015 UTC,"But crystal's TB can get you out of otherwise confirm death situations (Charging enemies, getting cornered, etc) which the normal shield can't. The TB also serves as a very quick mode of transport."
NuclearThrone,3ay6ce,Purppyping,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:49:45 2015 UTC,"It's a great mutation, but it requires you to immediately and drastically change the way you use the shield, and it's very hard to not get yourself killed with it"
NuclearThrone,3ay6ce,burningsensation,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:30:29 2015 UTC,"Why no on Fish and Y.V.'s Throne Butts? Fish's makes it easy to get around and Y.V.'s means a lot of late game is killed before they can attack. Also it's quad shot for triple reload, as opposed to double shot for double reload. Also with Impact Wrists it's like a pinball machine of enemies. It's a direct upgrade imo."
NuclearThrone,3ay6ce,tdtbaa,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:55:41 2015 UTC,"Are you looking for advice to beat the throne or to loop thrice?  Plant.  Plutonium hunger, strong spirit, rabbit's paw, bolt marrow, trigger fingers.  Homing shotgun, lightning cannon, auto heavy crossbow, blood cannon, auto crossbow, Gatling slugger, auto shotgun, auto flame shotgun, energy sword."
NuclearThrone,3ay6ce,LimeGhost,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:50:50 2015 UTC,"crystal. She makes the two most annoying bosses (in my opinion), Lil' Hunter and the Throne, cakewalks, and her Ultra B juggernaut makes even lategame crown of blood bullet hells a breeze, and will allow you to beat ballmum even if she gets too out of hand with the toxic ballguys.  Strong Spirit is the best mutation for less experienced players (still extremely good for experienced players alike). Once you start getting far (looping), bloodlust is an amazing mutation, and is very underrated but I consider NECESSARY for getting very far. Take plutonium hunger and rabbit paw whenever possible as well."

NuclearThrone,3ay6ce,mantrica,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:20:08 2015 UTC,"You should probably forget about looping for now and consider your goal to be ""getting past the bit you just died to"".  Crystal and Chicken are probably the most noob-friendly characters due to being harder to kill, and as for weapons, consider safe weapons that are easy to hit with and not so punishable when you miss, like Shotgun/Flame Shotgun/Auto Shotgun/Auto Flame Shotgun.  Experiment with all mutations, and while you're not confident, always pick up Rhino Skin and Strong Spirit, as well as Second Stomach."

NuclearThrone,3ay6ce,Dirst,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:46:13 2015 UTC,Honestly the only way to truely get better is to play alot. I used to die consistently to the sewer but liked the gameplay and put many hours(that I enjoyed putting into the game unlike some other games I have put alot of hours in) and now can consistently get to the throne. So all the advice I have is to play as many different characters with different weapons and different mutations until you get used to the game and can handle most situations.  And really for me one of  the best parts of the game is the feeling of acomplishment after seeing how much I have improved. Dont know if thats the case with you though.
NuclearThrone,3ay6ce,Shamison,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:27:26 2015 UTC,Play the game and take what you like
NuclearThrone,3ay6ce,jackctb,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm still shit at this game too and I've been playing for months!  What I've learned while playing Nuclear Throne is not to feel embarrassed or discouraged if you die. Remember that every run of the game is different and there are plenty of factors that could get in the way of success (such as spawning into a shitty location, not having enough ammo chests around, getting useless mutation choices, etc.).  Like others here said, the key is experimentation. Choose the mutant you're most comfortable handling. The game really requires good hand-eye coordination and concentration. If this is your skill, main the offensive characters such as Y.V. or Plant. If not, go with more defensive characters such as Crystal or Rebel. But you don't have to fall under these labels. Choose whoever you're the best with.  The others in here have covered some good mutations and weapons already so I'll keep it short. Along the way, you use the mutations you receive to build up a strategy that you want to put into motion. The mutations only last one run too so each game is a fresh start to experiment and strategize.  So, in conclusion..."
NuclearThrone,3ay6ce,calibore,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:13:31 2015 UTC,"Crystal is a good character to use to learn the game because she has 10 HP instead of 8, and she has the shield.  As for mutations, you definitely want to use Strong Spirit, Rabbit Paw, and Second Stomach. These are some of the best survival mutations to use, especially if coupled with Rhino Skin and Plutonium Hunger, maybe the Crown of Haste, too.  There are a ton of weapons in Nuclear Throne, so try them all out and see which one you like best. Personally, I find these to be among the best weapons in the game:   Heavy machine gun (although it loses its luster pretty quickly) Auto flame shotgun Gatling slugger Auto crossbow Seeker shotgun Blood cannon Any lightning weapon, especially the lightning cannon   Edit: HMG opinion"
NuclearThrone,3ay6ce,Exoskeletal65,2,Wed Jun 24 22:30:05 2015 UTC,"Heavy Machinegun stays relevant for a really long time if you've got Scarier Face, especially if you've got something heavy to deal with bulkier enemies"

NuclearThrone,3ay6ce,Epidemilk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:56:18 2015 UTC,"Weapons and mutations are more or less effective with different characters, so experimentation is key. Personally I tend to stay away from explosive weapons but you can get pretty far with a few different things."
NuclearThrone,3ay6ce,Gjones18,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:29:44 2015 UTC,"Git Gud  With all seriousness, while I'm in no way, shape, or form qualified to say this, (Only ever looped once, and I have 153 hours on the game) It all comes down to practice. That's all there is to it. You will develop your own feel and learn what works best for you. My advice is to practice, and every time you die, evaluate what you could have done differently in order to make it further. I literally just play for hours at a time, doing random over and over."

NuclearThrone,3awdau,GameForDaysYT,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:35:06 2015 UTC,"My favorite Throne Butts are Plant and Melting.  Plant's Throne Butt is like pre-nerf scarier face that you need to manually activate, while simultaneously keeping them in place. If you combine it with scarier face, the enemy essentially has 60% less health, which is simply incredible for bosses.  Melting's Throne Butt is amazing because it's so much fun. In some situations, you can get a chain reaction that will take out every enemy on the screen, which is just way too fun to give up. Also, blood explosions destroy projectiles, which can be really, really useful, especially on Big Dog.  Here's another question I'd like to see what people think about: What are the worst Throne Butts?  I'd say it's Fish and Crystal, and I don't imagine many people disagree."

NuclearThrone,3awei9,chaospudding,5,Wed Jun 24 01:34:40 2015 UTC,I would call that good luck. The screwdriver sucks!
NuclearThrone,3awei9,Ethan_the_Lion,2,Wed Jun 24 01:38:32 2015 UTC,Not if you want Golden Weapons.
NuclearThrone,3awei9,Dancing_Anatolia,2,Wed Jun 24 02:37:14 2015 UTC,"At this point youre better off using nuclear editor for golden weapons. Otherwise you spend a couple hours getting a good golden weapon for your favourite mutants, use them for a few days then have to do it again."
NuclearThrone,3awei9,stringerdell,-1,Wed Jun 24 07:30:06 2015 UTC,And so it starts. Why play the game when you can just edit it in?
NuclearThrone,3awei9,Ontrevant,5,Wed Jun 24 12:36:35 2015 UTC,You would have a point if golden weapons didnt reset every week. Restarting 1-1 ad nauseam for a screwdriver and getting disappointed by the 3rd golden machine gun in a row isn't 'playing the game'.
NuclearThrone,3awei9,stringerdell,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:46:16 2015 UTC,Just saying it worked before. But editing in a specific weapon is where it all unravels.

NuclearThrone,3attgw,MrOinkers,13,Tue Jun 23 13:30:39 2015 UTC,"Yadda yadda you've probably heard a million times before people say ""no toxic immunity,"" but the followup idea is actually pretty cool.  Plus if toxic becomes more widespread then there WILL be a justification for immunity."
NuclearThrone,3attgw,damimp,3,Tue Jun 23 13:46:49 2015 UTC,oh i didnt know people where against that idea . one of the most interesting things about Nuclear Throne for me is the different weapon effects and how to minmax the advantages and disadvatages so the idea came naturaly to me.^
NuclearThrone,3attgw,damimp,5,Tue Jun 23 14:03:13 2015 UTC,"The main reason people are against it is because the devs said they won't add it, on the grounds that toxic shows up so little that it wouldn't be justified.  It's kinda funny though, because we have fire resistance, and fire is used by what, three enemies?"
NuclearThrone,3attgw,mrpeach32,2,Tue Jun 23 14:13:07 2015 UTC,"let me count : lil hunter, salamanders, the fire traps, is that realy all? okay if we count explosions we can find a couple more probably ."
NuclearThrone,3attgw,zanderthedestroyer,4,Tue Jun 23 14:20:29 2015 UTC,"I mean, yes those, but also the explosions from tanks and the player character.  I've killed myself with explosives infinitely more than by walking into toxic."

NuclearThrone,3attgw,burningsensation,3,Tue Jun 23 14:12:01 2015 UTC,"Doing touch damage in a game where most of your enemies do touch damage or even oneshot on touch is plain stupidity. And on top of this there is melee weapons.  They should just remove GG and maybe add new mutations to aid explosives and fire weapons, as those types have no ""specific"" mutations as of yet."
NuclearThrone,3attgw,gamerx2132,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:41:46 2015 UTC,"but so do Poison weapons lack a mutation, and boiling veins achieves similar things for explosiv weapons. i dont get your first point tough."
NuclearThrone,3attgw,Mostyghostly,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:45:18 2015 UTC,"It can have some utility, especially early on when most of the enemies don't do touch damage. Plus I saw star do a run as dual mini guns steroids and ran out of ammo for the throne's second form, then killed it with gamma guts. Probably not gonna happen every day, but something that awesome and clutch happening at all makes me want it to stay in the game."
NuclearThrone,3attgw,burningsensation,2,Fri Jun 26 17:28:54 2015 UTC,It would make all the toxic weapons (Im looking a you toxic crossbow) not awful suicide guns.

NuclearThrone,3attgw,TheRealPurpleSatan,2,Wed Jun 24 18:57:02 2015 UTC,"Seems like a needed buff now that melee monsters can only hit you once a second. Mabye Gamma Guts could work like Boiling Veins, only making you immune at 4 hp or less. Total immunity might be a little overpowered when combined with toxic weapons."

Picking it and not carrying it through a portal won't unlock it; Picking it up and immediately dying before the end of the level also does not work.

NuclearThrone,3arp3l,JhoaoCkuNdari,16,Mon Jun 22 23:35:45 2015 UTC,...did they remove Boiling Veins? Or is that not specific to a certain type of weapon involving explosions or fire?
NuclearThrone,3arp3l,BioOnPC,14,Mon Jun 22 23:49:13 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is that Boiling Veins isn't a direct buff, and is more like covering your ass, and is also more commonly used for survival of explosions (and fire) that aren't yours. When I think ""weapon specific mutation"" I think of something more like Napalm Lung from the Community Remix, which is nothing but a straight buff to those weapons, like Laser Brain and Recycle Gland."
NuclearThrone,3arp3l,A_BEAUTIFUL_PONY,5,Tue Jun 23 00:34:48 2015 UTC,"and shotgun shoulders and bolt marrow.  i agree, but there is the crown of explosions crown of death (now), and that buffs it, the -1 hp is the cost of taking it whenever you want"
NuclearThrone,3arp3l,FMarkassa,3,Tue Jun 23 00:56:13 2015 UTC,"When I play Y.V., have Brrrrap, and have a nuke launcher, boiling veins is very definitely a direct buff!  Nothing quite like dropping four nukes right on Lil' Hunter's dumb face at point blank!"
NuclearThrone,3arp3l,KoboldCommando,4,Tue Jun 23 15:19:10 2015 UTC,"The reason why explosives don't have one in the normal game is probably because they are high-damage dealing grenades that deal damage in a radius and destroy walls. Plus, there aren't many explosive weapons that are crazy, and would need some sort of buff like that. In the Community Remix, there's a reason because of the amount of crazy batshit insane explosive weapons that were added in, and giving them an even more insane mutation just adds to the fun. I would see the reason if there were more ridiculous explosive weapons, but the most you might actually use it for is if you get a Nuke Launcher or a Gatling Bazooka."

NuclearThrone,3arp3l,Mae__,2,Tue Jun 23 01:03:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I'm talking about a direct buff. Something that's not ""look, now you can throw granades without even worrying about where they are""."

NuclearThrone,3arp3l,Lancer873,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:28:47 2015 UTC,"It isn't, the granades don't deal more damage because you can't die by being hit. After a while, you start being vigilant about props or where your granades land, just like checking mimics.   I use explosive weapons (not limited to granade/nuke launchers or bazookas) often and it's really sad to see that they are simply outpassed by any laser/bolt weapon in the late game. You can love explosive weapons as much as I do, or even more, but as soon as you get to the late game and have that laser brain or that bolt narrow, chances are you probably gonna get rid of whatever explosive weapon you do, regardless of wheter or not you have boiling veins.   I want something that makes explosive weapons straight up GREAT on the lategame. Something like a 3rd tick of damage or making corpses be on fire, or transforming all weapon-created explosions into blood explosion. Can you imagine a ultra granade launcher with blood explosions? Definitely as good as ultra laser pistol with laser brain (and possibly eagle eyes)! c: And Vlambleer should work on late-game flame weapons... Having just one is sad. Specially when it uses bullets and shots shotgun pellets."

NuclearThrone,3apxla,LITTLE-GUNTER,15,Mon Jun 22 15:34:24 2015 UTC,"That's not an overflow error at all. Not even close.  hitid, the variable introduced for the updated Game Over screen, was improperly transferred between projectiles and the player object (improperly meaning ""not at all""). This was mostly due to forgetting about certain attacks that enemies had, or from reflected projectiles that spawn other projectiles.  This week, the issue is that the Lightning Hammer's melee arc LightningSlash runs this code to hit the player every time that a prop is struck. This is because the Lightning Hammer is one of the few weapons that can kill the player in certain instances -- in this case, attempting to use it underwater. The issue is that the code is run even when not in the Oasis, but even more still that the hitid is still not properly transferred over.  This crash will come up whenever striking anything destructible with the Lightning Hammer, as all destructible things inherit from the same parent object: hitme. For the time being, avoid using the Lightning Hammer, there's nothing that can be done about the crash otherwise.  In particular, this error is a stack push. The variable is either unknown or is undefined. In this case, as I know the manner in which it was coded, hitid is merely undefined. JW really should have put some rudimentary safeguards in place by initializing the variable for all damaging object's create event, or by running a is_undefined(hitid) check before running code associated with hitid (and then having it spit out a dialog box so it still informs the user that there's an issue, but it won't cause a fatal crash).  If it were a genuine overflow error, the error message would state Stack Overflow and not Push :: Execution Error - Variable Get"

NuclearThrone,3arcnj,PokeJax,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:37:43 2015 UTC,"Enemies that do not encounter hitstun can be hit multiple times with a melee or any weapon with a lasting hitbox.  When Big Dog is doing something, e.g. spinning, it overrides hitstun and lets him get hit more than once.  For further example, Big Bandit and Palace Guardians can't be in hitstun while they are charging, so they are also vulnerable at that time.     Also, and this part might not be true, I believe toxic clouds consist of many small particles which disappear once they do damage.  That means they aren't a lasting hitbox and can hit something multiple times as fast as possible."

What would happen if I DID give it to someone? And would it count as sharing if all of the edits were made in a Dropbox folder where both people had access at all times?"
NuclearThrone,3anli5,peach-fig,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:57:48 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it would be fine, also if you want to share with others besides friends the best way I can think of is to just give the person the modified sprite sheet let the recompile it themselves."

NuclearThrone,3anli5,kit2224643,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:59:01 2015 UTC,What I meant by sharing is uploading the decompiled version or selling the changed version. Sharing the compiled thing or spritesheets is totally fine! (Unless Vlambo says otherwise)
NuclearThrone,3anli5,ledraps,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:34:29 2015 UTC,I think I'll go with sharing just the edited sprites

NuclearThrone,3anli5,GreatAtlas,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:23:34 2015 UTC,Well what I do is to use paint.net with a plugin called OptiPng
NuclearThrone,3anli5,stewartisme,2,Mon Jun 22 18:41:55 2015 UTC,How do I use this (In paint.net)
NuclearThrone,3anli5,stewartisme,2,Mon Jun 22 18:56:18 2015 UTC,"Copy all of the contents of the plugin to the FileTypes folder in the dictionary paint.net. once the plugin is installed, get your modified image and save it as optimized png which is a new file type that the plugin has given you."
NuclearThrone,3anli5,stewartisme,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:15:05 2015 UTC,Would anyone happen to know why after modifying a sprite sheet (not the pixel length/width) the image would end up larger in bytes than when I started? I'm not the most keen on this sort of thing. ._.
NuclearThrone,3anli5,stewartisme,2,Tue Jun 23 03:43:01 2015 UTC,"Ah that is because they compressed the images to make it smaller, you would need to compress the image once you are done editing it. I would suggest you use optipng plugin with Paint.net."

Mostly for easier access and better utility but also for my own practice.  So far there is no public build for it as it is not finished. There is still a lot to do. I will give a little information about what I will add in and what I will not add in.  What will be added in:   All current characters and their abilities All current weapons (Maybe) 1 or 2 fan made characters. THIS IS NOT SET IN STONE. DON'T SUGGEST ME ANY FAN CHARACTERS UNTIL I'VE DECIDED IF I WANT TO DO IT OR NOT Fan made weapons All current mutations New fan made mutations All current and new enemies (Maybe) Bonus levels   What won't be added in:   Ridiculously OP weapons/mutations Nerfs/buffs to specific characters/enemies. I want this to be as close to the normal game as I can possibly make it Additional bosses   I might add on more to these two lists. We'll see.  What works in the current build:   Sound (albeit a bit buggy. Also includes all area songs/ambient sounds.) Weapon/character animations Hit freeze (yay!) All characters (Apart from Horror who is still a WIP) Taking damage/dealing damage   What hasn't been tested yet:   Looping Bosses Some weapons Some collision detection with enemies Some character's active abilities   And that's pretty much it. If I accidentally left something out I'll edit this comment. But for now, enjoy the little preview!  Also, if you want to watch the progress, hangout or maybe just learn a thing or two you can come to my Twitch channel whenever I'm on!  Edit: Horror is missing some sounds.  Edit2: Word  Edit3: a thing  Edit4: Shameless self plug  Edit5: I will not be releasing the source files, only the executable."

It should be reskinned to a whitish color and be called the dubstep gun and Y.V. should have a moni cannon. Also you should try to think of guns for every character and maybe have 1 random one spawn each time you reach 0-1 instead of getting all of them.  The snare gun should probably do some damage and have a lower firerate so Project OWL can do a 1 weapon loop for it  EDIT: Were these character guns based off of Fish's guitar? If so Chicken needs a remote control that sets enemies it hits on slow motion or something(to remember the good ol' days)"
NuclearThrone,3amtj5,QTheNew42Q,3,Sun Jun 21 22:03:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah the Y.V. one was sort of tacked on last minute. I could easily just be a regular drop.

NuclearThrone,3aldoc,Psychopath12,4,Sun Jun 21 16:21:21 2015 UTC,"That's not an overflow error at all. Not even close.  hitid, the variable introduced for the updated Game Over screen, was improperly transferred between projectiles and the player object (improperly meaning ""not at all""). This was mostly due to forgetting about certain attacks that enemies had, or from reflected projectiles that spawn other projectiles.  This week, the issue is that the Lightning Hammer's melee arc LightningSlash runs this code to hit the player every time that a prop is struck. This is because the Lightning Hammer is one of the few weapons that can kill the player in certain instances -- in this case, attempting to use it underwater. The issue is that the code is run even when not in the Oasis, but even more still that the hitid is still not properly transferred over.  This crash will come up whenever striking anything destructible with the Lightning Hammer, as all destructible things inherit from the same parent object: hitme. For the time being, avoid using the Lightning Hammer, there's nothing that can be done about the crash otherwise."
NuclearThrone,3aldoc,Targuinius,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:28:23 2015 UTC,"Huh, I remember reading something about one of the arguments in hitid causing an overflow error. One of the numbers is also -2 and some more numbers."
NuclearThrone,3aldoc,Psychopath12,2,Sun Jun 21 20:59:21 2015 UTC,"Those 2 are the id of instances associated with the error. -2 is the denotation for other, which is used frequently in the collision event. Game Maker collision makes that simplified, as the collision takes place between self and the other.  In particular, this error is a stack push. The variable is either unknown or is undefined. In this case, as I know the manner in which it was coded, hitid is merely undefined. JW really should have put some rudimentary safeguards in place by initializing the variable for all damaging object's create event, or by running a is_undefined(hitid) check before running code associated with hitid (and then having it spit out a dialog box so it still informs the user that there's an issue, but it won't cause a fatal crash).  If it were a genuine overflow error, the error message would state Stack Overflow and not Push :: Execution Error - Variable Get"

NuclearThrone,3aldoc,Psychopath12,2,Mon Jun 22 06:05:03 2015 UTC,"The -2 is a prefix. As stated, it represents other. The stuff in the parenthesis in the error message are just extra bits of information about what instances are associated with the variable scope that is being called. For the most part, that can be ignored in its entirety, as the important information is delineated at the start of the error message: event and object. Using just that information as well as the content of the error itself, it can be easily traced through line by line if the programmer sees fit to do that, although sometimes variables need to be traced backwards when different instances do a ""hand-off"" of variable information as is the case with the hitid that JW's used for the Game Over screen."

I just died in the Daily while using an Auto Crossbow, and the ""killed by"" showed a shield (not the shielder himself, just the shield). Not sure if the Shielder's icon is just his shield and he shot me, or if it's bugged. Because shields don't reflect bolts, so there's no way his shield could have killed me.  edit: Another possible unintended thing spotted, Hostile Horror seems to be able to activate Crown Guardians by touching them (due to his contact damage). Kinda shitty when it becomes a 3v1 in the crown vault."

As much as I hated Lil Hunter, I always left feeling accomplished... because he was hard to beat. I think the ""safer spawning for 5-3"" alone would've made it ""manageable."" It wasn't fighting him... it was clearing out an area to fight him.  Since his rework, I have yet to die to him. He used to be the end of 80% of my runs... Now this game is just getting too easy.  It might be controversial... but that's my opinion."

NuclearThrone,3al921,TheLonelyPotato666,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:23:27 2015 UTC,"Extra Feet: This mutation is okay, but imo it's missing something. I suggest they make the portal pull you into it as fast as it used to (with and without Extra Feet), but make it so Extra Feet let's you outrun it all the time.    Given how easily you can avoid going into portals at the end of levels, this wouldn't do much.    Gamma Guts and Hammerhead: I suggest we merge them into one (and still call it Hammerhead cause that name is way cooler). Would it be OP? I don't know...    Gamma guts just got a buff, it does damage in a radius. It's pretty good, especially as Chicken because of the bleeding thing.  Hammerheard and Gamma Guts are also very different mutations. I wouldn't want to combine them simply because one is offensive and the other is utility/defensive. Hammerhead has a lot of really good uses anyway, they're just a bit unconventional so nobody gives it any love :(    Impact Wrists: I think we shouldn't make this mutation better directly, but make the game harder without it. IW would be a lot better if enemies didn't already do damage if they fly against another enemy.    But flying corpses are awesome. Vlambeer wouldn't remove something awesome from the game and make it mutation-only.    Laser Brain: doesn't make you just 'do more damage', but changes energy weapons slightly to make them better. So the description should be 'Enhanced Energy Usage'. This also sounds way cooler than the current description. Make Ion Cannon work with LB too!    I agree that Laser Brain really should be more interesting than just more damage, but how? ""changes weapons slightly to make them better"" in what way?    Last Wish: I don't know how, but it needs to be buffed. Especially now that you have to waste a mutation slot to go to the spoilers.    The plan is for the jungle to give you ab extra mutation, therefore making Last Wish a useful early game mutation because you can get your mutation back if you make it to 5-1.    Rabbit Paw: I think they nerfed it too much. From 8% drop change to 11.2% doesn't make a very big difference to me. I haven't been pocking it a lot since update #72    Rabbit Paw is still one of the best mutations with great synergies (Plutonium Hunger and Second Stomach) after the nerf.    Sharp Teeth: Does double the damage you take to all enemies on screen now. If they make that triple or quadruple the damage, it would be worth it.    It's already definitely worth it already. In a crowded area you can get hit and clear the screen. It's meant for saving your ass in tough spots and it does that fantastically.    Stress: This mutation is good as Crystal, but sucks as Melting. To change this, my suggestion is to make it 'shoot 60% faster when under half health'. This would make it viable to every character, except two HP Melting, since he/she can't be under half HP.    Part of the appeal of Melting is the vastly different mutation tier list. You can still get good usage of Stress if you have Rhino Skin or Strong Spirit. It's not as good because it's higher risk but it still works and I don't think that the difference between Crystal and Melting warrants a change to Stress.   Throne Butts:    Crystal: Crystal is a cool character, being a tank and all, but his Throne Butt (going to refer to it as TB from now on) needs some reworking. I think the problem is that it's too hard to just shield if you have TB. I would suggest that right clicking would still make you shield, but right clicking twice in a timespan of one second would make you teleport to where your cursor is.    The idea with Crystal's Throne Butt (and also her Ultra mutations) is that you can play her as either a tank or an incredibly mobile powerhouse. It's basically a trade off here - do you want to be able to sit still and tank, or be super mobile with trickier tanky capabilities?    YV: His TB should make Pop Pop better and not change it imo. What I think it should do is let you Pop Pop either for no extra ammo, or for no extra reload time. My prefered one is the second one.    It already does lower your reload time compared to the amount of shots you fire at once. You have a higher DPS constantly Pop Popping than normally firing, and Throne Butt improves that.    Steroids: His TB doesn't really fit with him I think. It doesn't necessarilly make his right click ability better, it just makes you get ammo. Why? My suggestion is that if you're holding down both mouse buttons, both your weapons shoot a little bit faster. But that's a bit boring aswell, so i have a second suggestion. If you're holding down both mouse buttons, every enemy you kill makes a blood explosion.    I agree with you on the ammo not fitting, and the fire rate increase when firing both is a decent idea, but seems to close to YV's fire rate increase. And blood explosions seem to close to Melting.    Rogue: Her TB is good, but you still have to use it a lot when you don't need it, because of the portal strike ammo cap. I suggest TB does what it does already, but also makes the ammo cap go up to 5 or 6.    You don't have to use it when you don't need it, but honestly, using it a lot helps. I don't understand your complaint with it - you get too much ammo? Use it more! I feel like a higher cap would lead to people using the strikes less, and only on bosses. This isn't as fun and it doesn't enforce Rogue's playstyle of using the strike frequently. And we already have the boss killer: Plant.   If you did, thanks for reading!   You're welcome!  I'm sorry to nitpick so much, but it seems you're suggesting that most mutations are made more powerful, when really, they're actually fairly balanced already. A lot of this stuff is good how it is and just doesn't need to change. I feel like making these things more powerful will just unbalance things."
NuclearThrone,3al921,buster2Xk,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:13:03 2015 UTC,"For laser brain, there was no change in mechanic but rather in description.  It has a net effect of energy weapons doing more damage, but not as a flat damage buff, so the suggestion was change the description to make it more accurate."
NuclearThrone,3al921,atrain99,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:09:37 2015 UTC,"Extra Feet: Before update #77, it pulled you in much faster. I would suggest that gets cahnged back to how it used to be. Gamma Guts: I didn't know Gamma Guts got a buff. Thanks for pointing that out, I'm gonna try it out now. I'm not really tempted by Impact Wrists because this is already in the game without the mutation. There used to be a lot less ice (in 5-x) and webs (in 4-1), but they changed it so Extra Feet would be better. I thnik they can do something like that for Impact Wrists aswell. Laser Brain: As /u/atrain99 pointed out, I was talking about the description. I hope it's clear now. Last Wish: Didn't know that either. Thanks! Rabbit Paw: I don't know... It doesn't feel nearly as good as before the nerf. Sharp Teeth: Let's say you take 3 health damage, which is quite a big chunk of your health. All enemies take 6 damage then. It's meant to save your aas for really crowded situations, but since those mostly happen in loops, and enemies in loops have way more than 6 health, I think it's not balanced. It is good with Rebel though, but imo only with her. Stress: If you have 1 health as Melting (with RS), you don't have as much of a fire rate increase since you still have 1/6 (17%) of your health. If you have 1 health as crystal (with Fortress and RS), you only have 1/18 (6%) of your health, so you get a bigger fire rae increase. That's why I (and a lot of the streamers I watch) pick it when playing as Crsytal, but not while playing as any other character. Crsytal: Fish can roll a lot when he has TB, but he can still easily roll a short distance. Crystal's shielding in place gets way harder. The thing is, you ( me atleast) can regularly use Pop Pop, but Braaaaapp is very situational. Steroids: I agree about the YV and Melting things. Any other ideas? I guess that's kind of true, but sometimes I use it for three enemies or something when I have 3 portal strikes and there is a portal strike canister in front of me."
NuclearThrone,3al921,RotalumisEht,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:17:09 2015 UTC,I think making steroids throne butt give him an extra weapon slot could be interesting. Like his current throne butt it would help offset the ammo problems due to his inaccuracy and I think it would fit lore wise since he is stronger and could carry more. He would still only be able to fire two weapons at once of course.

NuclearThrone,3al1ey,mantrica,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:57:04 2015 UTC,"plant feels pretty fair. horror has the best passive and arguably the best active. honestly his active is the best, not even close. built in ultra weapon beam that can be a panic button of sorts.   point i'm trying to make is a few updates back they slightly nerfed horror but not to the degree of fish's gun warrant. they cut his gun warrant by 40%. imagine if horror's beam did 40%  less damage or used 40% more rads. i know its sorta apples to kiwis comparison, but the nerf was a little too drastic IMO."
NuclearThrone,3al1ey,Carradine,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:13:37 2015 UTC,"I think a good nerf to Horror would be to not get the rads back from his beam, basically make it a true ultra weapon. This would require strategic use of the beam without reducing it's damage or utility."
NuclearThrone,3al1ey,MajorStupidity11,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:40:43 2015 UTC,"I digress.  Fish's nerf seems acceptable by all means, and Horror does need some acute nerfing, but I don't think Horror is always the best character to play on the daily.

NuclearThrone,3al1ey,Psychopath12,0,Sun Jun 21 23:05:23 2015 UTC,"If anything, Fish became very OP in late-game because of the combination of a powerful late-game weapon (most notorious would be Super Plasma Cannon), Gun Warrant, and Trigger Fingers.  If any of those were the true culprit of the combination, it'd have to have been Trigger Fingers. But being a normal mutation, it'd need to be very delicately handled so as to not upset the balance it has created with other mutations on other mutants.  My proposal would've been to have the reload reduction only trigger once per ""attack."" Automatic weapons would function normally, piercing and splash weapons would only trigger once, multi-firing weapons (grenade shotgun, wave gun, assault rifle, etc) would have the cluster function as a singular attack.  This way, the Super Plasma Cannon would not be able to reload itself nigh instantly when fired into a crowd with trigger fingers.  It'd still be good and for the most part it'd be largely unchanged, but nowhere near as good as before when paired with Fish's ultra."

NuclearThrone,3als2m,varun_pcg,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:46:20 2015 UTC,It's early access. What if tweaking the way kills are recorded makes Plant impossible to unlock? They wouldn't be able to find out as easy because everybody already has Plant unlocked. Stuff like that.

NuclearThrone,3aidpr,j-dag,3,Sat Jun 20 15:06:10 2015 UTC,It could be that the radiation affected his sickness and made him suffer more...
NuclearThrone,3aidpr,Helicuor,2,Sat Jun 20 19:48:30 2015 UTC,It seems pretty obvious to me that the radiation is what makes him sick and suffering.
NuclearThrone,3aidpr,_-mayo-_,0,Sun Jun 21 04:52:45 2015 UTC,I thought (in a previous comment) that the radiation made it worst
NuclearThrone,3aidpr,Frunkward,4,Sun Jun 21 07:02:00 2015 UTC,Nice theory.And  very sad theory :(
NuclearThrone,3aidpr,eltiolavara9,3,Sat Jun 20 14:43:10 2015 UTC,If he had a death wish I think he could have ended it a lot sooner and with much less trouble... There's no reason he would want to get to the throne. It could end him as well as any enemy. I think he either has a secondary motivation or doesn't want to die.
NuclearThrone,3aidpr,Frunkward,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:42:19 2015 UTC,"Your right, but when melting dies, you can use your special once more and blow up yourself, releasing a SAD ghost, meaning that he suffers MORE than from when he is alive/undead."

NuclearThrone,3aka8a,Batteryhorse,2,Sun Jun 21 01:37:22 2015 UTC,"that explains it. thanks for the help, The portal opened really quickly after the throne died too, so that's probably why my rads didn't come through."

NuclearThrone,3ak6v9,Batteryhorse,6,Sun Jun 21 01:38:06 2015 UTC,I dont think a fast paced game like NT would work in laggy servers like Steam's or Xbox's so i dont think thats a possibility.  Also who trusts Kotaku?
NuclearThrone,3ak6v9,Mate9,5,Sun Jun 21 02:35:57 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine it have preset levels with each player having a set weapon and can pick up weapons from the chest, with the ability to set what weapon can be picked up from random loot chests.  my main concern is that the game in its current state is not balanced for multiplayer. characters like rogue, rebel or crystal are significantly more powerful against other players than characters like melting. certain weapons in the game are a direct upgrade from other weapons in the game(smg vs minigun, or crossbow vs auto crossbow) and the game is far more based around offense than defense, making it possible to snowball in multiplayer if you get a good weapon.  If vlambeer is planning online multiplayer, it'd be interesting to see how they address these issues."
NuclearThrone,3ak6v9,professorMaDLib,6,Sun Jun 21 01:40:30 2015 UTC,"When people say ''online multiplayer'', they don't mean PvP, they mean a co-op online mode, where you complete the levels with your friends over the internet."
NuclearThrone,3ak6v9,Ommpansthe,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:49:13 2015 UTC,"Then the challenge comes from scaling the number of enemies with the number of players and managing gun availability and ammo conservation issues with 4 players. With the current system, co-op with one friend is actually a pretty big challenge in the late game due to gun and ammo scarcity as only one gun and one ammo chest drops per level. This problem will be even bigger with 4 players. With nuclear throne right now, the pre loop game will be too easy as there too much players per floor in comparison to the number of enemies, and the post loop will be much harder as competition between availible guns and ammo really start to surface."

NuclearThrone,3agouq,TweetPoster,2,Sat Jun 20 00:34:55 2015 UTC,"Alright, so Lil' Hunter now spawns IDPD, and his (?) two attacks are shooting that small shotgun burst and the single line of bullets. I like these changes! It's less of a cover situation (though cover is important) and more of a multitasking situation, dealing with both Hunter and IDPD.  Still, having IDPD there kind of changes Lil' Hunter's lore though, doesn't it? I heard that they were there because they went insane after being abandoned during a mission."

NuclearThrone,3agouq,Mate9,3,Sat Jun 20 05:00:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think he is rogue, just crazy."

NuclearThrone,3agouq,mowdownjoe,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:39:23 2015 UTC,It could be the IDPD decided they should hire a mercenary to track you down and aid in your arrest. And Lil' Hunter would be that merc.
NuclearThrone,3agouq,Mate9,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:59:04 2015 UTC,"His known lore is that he is an ex-I.D.P.D soldier who went crazy (and apparently rogue), why would the I.D.P.D hire a crazy and dangerous soldier with a record?"

Possibly ex-IDPD, but as far as I know he's just a bounty hunter and chances are the IDPD are working alongside him to hunt down the throne hunters.  He supposedly has the saddest backstory in the game though."
NuclearThrone,3agouq,Mate9,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:42:42 2015 UTC,"According to the Wiki (Which is a pretty viable source for this kind of info) it says he is a ""rogue, slightly insane I.D.P.D member"", if hes a rogue he probably isn't an official agent anymore"
NuclearThrone,3agouq,buster2Xk,1 point,Sun Jun 21 08:11:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the wiki is usually pretty good with this stuff, but that sentence seems more like it was written to be descriptive. I don't recall jw or Rami ever saying he's a rogue but of course I could have missed something!"
NuclearThrone,3agouq,Mate9,1 point,Sun Jun 21 09:39:55 2015 UTC,"Well the devs always say a thing or two about the official lore in their weekly streams, i mean Paul confirmed Steroids to be asexual/agender/non-binary (dont really know how you say it)"
NuclearThrone,3agouq,buster2Xk,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:00:54 2015 UTC,"asexual/agender/non-binary (dont really know how you say it)   Well asexual means no sex, which is what sex you physically are (which parts you've got). Agender means no gender, which means you don't identify as male or female or anything between. And non-binary just means you don't fit into the usual idea of two genders. Non-binary includes trans, agender, asexual, genderfluid etc. So I guess all three are correct!  I think Steroids used to be male though, before pumping himself with chemicals. Now he's just a mutant. It might also be a reference to steroids shrinking the testes. Maybe he took so much steroids his sex organs are gone entirely.  But, we digress. I'm still not entirely sure about Li'l Hunter being a rogue, but I guess he could be. I guess time will tell?"

Also the fact that these needs can happen simultaneously it would constantly switch between multiple modes.  Ultimately I say it's way too OP, and ruins the quite necessary randomness of the game."
NuclearThrone,3agqtf,Ackbar01,10,Sat Jun 20 00:54:23 2015 UTC,That is the real reason.  The devs didn't think a turret fit the game's style.  Same reason they just changed Chicken's active.  It didn't fit their vision for the game.

Also, a couple of questions, i'm currently learning to program in GM:S and would like too know how to make a custom GUI, is it just in a Draw event instead of a Draw GUI event?(And, how bloody big did you make the room?)"
NuclearThrone,3ae3sz,angushatesreddit,2,Fri Jun 19 13:38:58 2015 UTC,"Well, first thing: Welcome to the wonderful world of GameMaker! :D  And here we go, the room is actually just 320x240, I just didn't clamp the view to lock in the room, allows it to follow the player out of the room.   And the Draw event and the Draw GUI event are rather different. Draw will draw sprites/text/shapes at a normal scale, scaling with the application surface (size of the window), on the otherhand, Draw GUI will draw sprites/shapes/text on a 1:1 scale no matter the size of the window. When using Draw GUI, you'll have to account for multiple factors, for example, the window size and positions you draw at. If you wanted to draw on the far right side of the screen, you would have to use window_get_width() to reach the right size, since they're not being scale with the window.  tl;dr: Unless you're making menus, use the Draw event for HUD elements."

A plutonium hunger and rush crown would get you to level 20 too quickly. Knowing she's an owl, I was thinking of something like this  Ultra B: flight - upon entering a new stage, Athena is in the air, thus being invincible, for a couple of seconds and can move freely.. She then crashes to the ground, creating a blood explosion (doesn't have to be a blood explosion, it just doesn't damage the player)."

Maybe let the passive be more accurate targeting within a weapon's range of variance, and have the active be the magnetic shots you talk about in Throne Butt? That sounds more interesting IMO than just ""let the computer always aim for you"". Also, going to level 20 sounds way OP, especially considering Melting's Ultra which gives them levels.

My 2nd best run, as well, but the most kills i've had in a run.  EDIT: Also the image is a bit clipped so you can't see all my mutations, but I got an early strong spirit and rhino skin.  EDIT 2: Was able to loop again with him, but died on 1-2 to a guardian dog cuz i was greedy for a weapons chest before going into the crown vault. I had the most epic lil'hunter fight that run.

NuclearThrone,3acecj,GrizonII,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:36:52 2015 UTC,"This isn't entirely true.  You can import it into GameMaker: Studio, but a fair ammount of functions that would be used in GM8.1 are deprecated and won't work in Studio, due to the new cross-compiler.  You can work on creating work-arounds though, this would probably take a while. So it'd be best just to use 8.1 rather than Studio if you're not much of a programmer."

NuclearThrone,3abdvx,WataugaCJ,2,Thu Jun 18 23:47:47 2015 UTC,It can be risky if you don't pay attention (like me) but I find that using the Toxic Bow over the cross bow to be a simple work around for this. Usually if it doesn't hit the enemy the poison cloud will anyway.  The only drawback is I don't think there are no substitutes for Heavy or Super crossbows. At least I haven't seen any heavy or super toxic bows yet!

NuclearThrone,3a8aa8,SherkPentagram,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:45:37 2015 UTC,"That's just poor run rng or poor planning if you die to being run over, the throne didn't kill you your lack of ammo did. To be honest, I feel the throne is pretty tricky when it comes to dodging, though they should tweak it some so things like recycle gland don't make it a joke."
NuclearThrone,3a8aa8,DusttoAshes,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:04:18 2015 UTC,"You basically just pointed out what I meant. Poor RNG or needing planning. That shouldn't be what the final boss is- a battle of weapon RNG or needing to take specific weapons just for one enemy. It should be about the skill during the battle, not before it. Even if you consider the Throne tricky to dodge(which I personally don't unless im trapped at the end of the hallway), that doesn't make up for the fact that even if you can dodge it easily you can get screwed by bad RNG or the fact that a bunch of extremely tanky guardian dogs just vacuumed all of your ammo, just for another extremely tanky fight that sucks away the rest of your ammo, just to be met with a slightly less tanky version of the boss, who's slightly less tankiness doesn't really matter due to the fact you probably don't have much ammo anyways."
NuclearThrone,3a8aa8,SherkPentagram,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:49:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's unfortunately the issue with a rng based game, without taking away what makes the game great you can't really balance things that are determined by whether or not the game likes you that day. the throne could be tweaked so it's more skill based, but in the end RNG still has a massive part in whether or not you're dead."
NuclearThrone,3a8aa8,DusttoAshes,1 point,Sun Jun 21 05:53:56 2015 UTC,"it's not all rng based... that's why good players can consistently loop while less good players cannot, even with very bad weapons you cna usually make due if you dodge everything, but that's usually not the case with the throne fight. The better I get at fighting the throne, the more I realize there is a certain skill to it, of controlling the throne's behavior and getting ammo from the plasma balls, but at a certain point the balls become too hectic, and when your out of ammo the only other option is to run away just to get trapped at the end of the hallway. Just because it's seeded doesn't necessarily mean it's rng based, it's more based on weapon knowledge, mutation picking, and dodging skill, and while spawns can heavily influence outcomes, the developers are literally working to counter that, and that doesn't matter in the throne fight either. Even if the throne was less tanky, which I wish it was, it would more just be better to get the fight over with quicker, because it barely feels rewarding when you beat it since the bullet hell is so easy. Wanting to fight a harder throne with the same health it has now would just be plain masochistic, but if it was harder and had less health, not only would the fight feel more rewarding to finish, it would be less annoying, and more of a final boss than an ammo checker."

Just make sure the spawn and firing isn't really spammy and have some sort of ammo generation on site and bam, a better boss who won't run you over because you ran out of ammo."

The Smoke ability seems a bit weak though since the player would know his last location, maybe have him flick the cigar at the player and if it hits them their view is SEVERELY diminished to like maybe half of normal or a little less?  The Rat King could maybe work? The summon ability would definitely need tweaked, it feels wrong that it can summon rats that look normal but have more health without a visual change to denote that. Maybe just make a new specific rat type it can spawn that has the chance to drop ammo. The thought of the Mutate ability seems obnoxious to me at first, but when I remind myself this is on a loop it seems a bit better. I think the Rat King suffers from the same problem as the other loop bosses (aside from Technomancer) in that they're just big things to spam at. The rats spawned shouldn't be an issue for the player, the charge is the only thing that could really get the player and that they'd have to play around. Oh also you'd need a fourth new rat type for the rats that explode. I think there's a point where we'd have too many rat colors though lol."

After about 40 hours of game play, I still get super excited to play and don't really ever feel that it's very repetitive unless I'm playing a really long session.  I would very strongly recommend this game if you've been interested for a while, as I was, because it certainly lived up to all my expectations."

NuclearThrone,3a722y,BioOnPC,5,Thu Jun 18 19:53:21 2015 UTC,"Have you really been following the game that closely for 2 months without actually buying the game? Maybe I'm misreading the first two paragraphs.    The game is only like $13 bucks, and while this week seems to be a game-crashy bug type of week, that'll be fixed soon enough. If you've burnt yourself out on the game before you've even played it, the problem might not be the game, but the player.    Considering that the game is less than $15, and most people seem to break 20 hours within a week of owning it, it's probably worth picking up even if you get tired right there and never play again. But you will probably play again. And again and again.    When the game is ""Complete"" they'll probably add achievements and a lot of things to truly permanently unlock giving the game more goals."
NuclearThrone,3a722y,purehatred89,3,Wed Jun 17 21:01:42 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the ""repetitive"" part seems to be fixed by the fact that there are new additions EVERY WEEK. Plus, there are plenty of things that are still hidden that we need to find, like the yeti."

NuclearThrone,3a722y,TheSilverSpiral,3,Wed Jun 17 19:53:33 2015 UTC,"Another factor that contributes to the game's current high-replayability is the fact that the game isn't even done yet, and so it's fun to notice the game's progress and changes with each weekly-update.    Also, I love seeing general improvement in my daily runs.  A lot of credit needs to be given towards http://thronebutt.com/; it's a really great website and I hope it's eventually implemented in-game somehow."
NuclearThrone,3a722y,Mae__,3,Wed Jun 17 20:28:24 2015 UTC,"$14 for 200+ hours, and the game isn't even finished yet. Definitely worth it. It only gets repetitive if you don't try new things. If you only take the crossbow and the laser pistol, you'll get bored quickly. Likewise, if you only take the ""go-to mutations"" you'll be missing out on some fun interactions. The game has over 100 guns right now, and more are added constantly. The fact that you can hold two guns that will compliment each other and basically define your playstyle for the run makes for a lot of variation. Add to that almost 30 mutations and 12 characters, each with its own passive and active, Throne Butt, and 2 Ultra Mutations. That's a LOT of variables right there, and more will be added before the game is done. Honestly, I'll second that NT has made me have a lot less patience for BoI. I love Rebirth to fucking death, but it has gotten a lot more samey after 300 hours than Nuclear Throne has at 200 hours (though I guess I should factor in vanilla playtime). Nuclear Throne is a game you HAVE to focus for. Your mind has to be apt and functioning quickly. It's really zen honestly. When you get in the zone, it feels almost euphoric. Not a lot of games feel that satisfying. Maybe wait for the game to be finished and buy it then. It'll be out maybe by the end of the year. Rami said in the recent update that the game is months away from final release, so take that as you will."
NuclearThrone,3a722y,Lninol,2,Thu Jun 18 02:54:59 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, I'm 200 hours in and the game has gotten a little repetitive, but it still is very enjoyable to try weapon combinations when I get the chance. If you treat this game like a max-min rpg and download the save editor, you'll probably burn through it quickly. If you instead try to improvise your playstyle and actively make decisions about your mutations and weapon choices, you'll have a lot more fun.   Oh, should you buy the game, definitely try Disc Gun + Wrench on Steroids. That combo is my favorite.  After playing this game and then trying RoR and BoI, let me warn you, I found those very boring."
NuclearThrone,3a722y,MalusandValus,3,Wed Jun 17 19:42:22 2015 UTC,Definitely think that the fast pace will ruin my patience for those other games. :/
NuclearThrone,3a722y,Optional_Guy,2,Wed Jun 17 21:02:09 2015 UTC,"For your dislikes,   The areas are all pretty different, mostly because of the enemies spawned and the layout, some stages are dark so you can only see a bit, some have a more open layout. Furthermore some levels have bosses, which really helps with variety imo.  In my 120 hours played i haven't felt it being very repetitive yet, if you feel like it's becoming repetitive you can always start doing challenges like starting with certain crowns, or save-editing weapons in.  For the highly skill based part, it's still luck dependend, good weapon drops + mutations can carry you really hard."
NuclearThrone,3a722y,KoboldCommando,2,Wed Jun 17 20:17:30 2015 UTC,"I'd personally say that what makes it a great game is the fast paced and difficult gunplay combined with fantastic characters.  If you look at the Binding of Isaac, the characters are really quite similar, and the playstyle differences between characters are small and make no difference to the core gameplay outside of Azazel, who is poorly designed anyway, but that's another matter. Fish and Crystal are pretty much the only ""Standard"" characters the game has with less differences between them than the others, but practically every other one makes you play the game differently, which is something I love about the game.  It's also got the great element where you can die if you aren't paying attention for a tiny period of time. This is pretty similar to Dark Souls, in that the most basic enemies will kill you very quickly even if you're at maximum power, which is something I absolutely love. At some points in Isaac it can be hard to lose, but never, ever in NT."
NuclearThrone,3a722y,LazliiX,2,Wed Jun 17 22:02:36 2015 UTC,"I think when it comes to the repetitive gameplay, it's just a matter of how much you like/love the game. I don't get bored of it just because of how insanely intense the game gets especially when you loop and it's just fun to have a game that requires that amount of concentration and skill from the player and one mistake can end up costing you your run.  When it comes to the areas I think that they're 100% fine, they're interesting and different enough and the enemies all have different threat levels associated with them imo. Now the loop bosses are a different story, at least some of them. I find the one in the crystal caves super boring in its design but I feel like it might change at some point."

NuclearThrone,3a722y,captain_frisk,2,Thu Jun 18 19:01:52 2015 UTC,"The differences between the areas are the monsters and hazards, but that's all you need, they feel extremely different!  Running around the wastelands gunning down bandits while worrying about a scorpion around the next corner, or fleeing from hordes of melee rats, or dodging jets of fire and exploding cars while snipers and machine guns fire at you from all sides, and the long thin corridors where wolves and snow-bots charge at you viciously.  The levels are differentiated a lot more than in a lot of games where there's more visual variation.  As for the repetition, that's mitigated by the high difficulty, the skillfulness, and the random factors.  You never know exactly what to expect, and you'll always get different mutations and weapons, so no two runs feel exactly the same.  And the game is extremely challenging yet rewarding, you really hone your abilities at it over time.  And yet it never becomes trivial, you're always on the brink of death.  When I started I got slaughtered by Big Bandit, and then I thought I'd never kill Big Dog, now I can reliably get to Lil' Hunter if not the Throne, but I'll still regularly get killed by swarms of maggots, scorpions, or just Big Bandit showing up in an extremely inconvenient location.  It's that kind of constant improvement while never becoming trivial that makes a game really last a long time."

NuclearThrone,3a6u88,Jebidijed,4,Wed Jun 17 22:56:12 2015 UTC,"Ninja       Lore Ninja was just an ordinary Assasin in Scrapyard, but compared to other Assasins, he was slightly smarter. He was able to score countless kills by using his skill, feigning his death, and knowing when to bail. One day, he fought a strange and never seen mutant that looked like a crab wearing a mask that covered all of its face besides its eyes and mouth. When Ninja first killed it, it somehow faked its death by creating a fake corpse and fooling him. This trick barely cost his life, but his situational awareness saved him from getting stabbed in the back. Once the crab mutant is dead for good, Ninja found a strange device that the crab was using. It was a classic gold plated stopwatch, but completely different in terms of function. Once he realized that this device helped that crab mutant to fake its death so realistically, Ninja kept the device while training hard and mutating further to try mimic the device's function. In 2 months, he succeeded in copying the watch's ability. During his training, he heard about a legendary Throne that will set the world right or let anyone to do anything they wish. Packing his trusty old stick and the watch as a good luck charm, he sets off to find the legendary Throne as well as meeting new friends at the campfire...       Appearance Similar looking as the Assasin, but with blue eye instead of red eye. He also chained the watch on his side, so it is visible.       Starting Weapon: Ninja Stick Slightly longer range than Screwdriver, but shorter than Wrench. Swing rate is slower than Chicken Sword, but more damage compared to it.       Passive Slightly longer melee range. 1/3 of Long Arms. Melee weapons swing faster by 20%       Active Ability: Feigns Death. When you get hit by any source of damage while holding RMB, Ninja will take 1 damage, leave a fake corpse, and turn invisible to enemies. Holding RMB will make Ninja's eye glow brightly as a visual appearance for preparing cloak. Ninja cannot attack while holding RMB. Once activated, Ninja will take half damage from any source of damage, but cannot attack for the duration of 5 seconds. Enemies will not target Ninja while he's invisible, but they will still move around the map. He can drop his cloak anytime by firing a weapon. Recharge time of active is 1 minute and Ninja's eye will flash brightly to signal its charge.       Throne Butt: Quick Regeneration Reduces Ninja's cloak regeneration by 20 seconds.       Ultra A: Decoy The fake corpse will blow up 5 seconds after deployed. It will create a blood explosion with impressive damage and blast radius. Damage and blast radius are equal to 4 grenade shots.       Ultra B: True Stealth Once activating the cloak, Ninja will teleport to his spawn location,  enemies will completely stop their movements, and his cloak duration increased to 10 seconds.       Loading Screen Tips * Gentlemen * Time doesn't matter anymore * Live for another day * It looks so real! * Peekaboo! * Giant enemy crab * Cloaking is a life saver * A quick getaway       Ninja Stick tip * A trusty companion       Ultra Mutation tips * Master of deception * 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... * A clean getaway"

For instance, if you were at level 3, you could skip the sewers and go straight to the scrapyard, but you would be only level 2 in the scrapyard, removing your mutation, and requiring you to collect rads until you were level 3 again.

He then was revived by the Necromancers as an experiment in biological modification featuring Rads. However, the excess rads in his brain were driving him insane, and forced him to kill all the Necromancers. He now hopes to cleanse himself of mutation using the Nuclear Throne.  Personality: While prone to bursts of violence when angered, Orc is very focused on ""nobleness"" and ""purity"". He seeks to clear out the wastes of mutation, and believes that the Nuclear Throne could be key to this.

Steroids and Athena traveled together for a long time, but the I.D.P.D. kidnapped Athena. Being a tactical genius, she managed to escape and discover their secrets, which happened to include the darkest secrets of the universe. She returned to the labs and tried to make a time machine, which malfunctioned sending in mutants from all different worlds and timelines. Most got corrupted and/or fused creating Freaks, Tanks, etc. The time machine exploded and inside the fire and rubble she saw something, her long lost brother. Without hesitating, she jumped through, but the radioactive fire corrupted her too. She gained psychic powers(and became an owl), but lost her memories, of Steroids, of her childhood, of her past.

NuclearThrone,3a4pqy,QTheNew42Q,0,Wed Jun 17 21:51:04 2015 UTC,rogue is legit hard mode

I use a game pad, so I find it near impossible to draw good lines as Rogue for her active blaster; so I just don't ever play the character."
NuclearThrone,3a4pqy,brandugh,3,Wed Jun 17 09:04:13 2015 UTC,My best character was Chicken but now that they've changed her RMB I can't play her at all...
NuclearThrone,3a4pqy,Gjones18,2,Wed Jun 17 22:35:58 2015 UTC,"Melting and Crystal, I can loop just fine but Melting always screws with my head because of his low HP and I always end up using Crystal's special at a shitty time and can't hold out long enough to withstand onslaughts (I typically play with Crown of Blood active at the beginning)."
NuclearThrone,3a4pqy,aoanla,2,Wed Jun 17 10:10:53 2015 UTC,"I'm terrible at all of the characters (only 6 hours of play, and I rarely get past the Desert),  but Fish is my worst I think - he's the only one whose active actually seems to result in my dying when I use it.

NuclearThrone,3a4pqy,BKachur,2,Wed Jun 17 22:07:02 2015 UTC,"Plant is probably the strongest character in the game balance wise. He's real fast and can dodge better. Plus the trap + throne butt knocks off 40% hp of all the bosses including the throne.  Good use for his active is stopping people from rushing you like rats, yeti's or crystal spiders. Just put it in a choke point and stand behind it, they run at you but get stopped by the snare."

NuclearThrone,3a15wl,pecet,9,Tue Jun 16 13:49:42 2015 UTC,"It's pretty hard to make some of them look good together, so only way i see is to make another art for some mutations if you have them both."
NuclearThrone,3a15wl,HuurrDuurr,9,Tue Jun 16 13:58:49 2015 UTC,I honestly think the easiest solution would to be; A) Have the first you mutation you pick be the only visible mutation or B) Every new mutation overrides the last mutation.
NuclearThrone,3a15wl,daviddwk,9,Tue Jun 16 14:04:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe it could have slots so you could have the extra feet and a hat at the same time, but when another power up uses the hat slot it would override the last hat."
NuclearThrone,3a15wl,HuurrDuurr,7,Tue Jun 16 16:56:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but i want your monster to look badass at the end of the game."

NuclearThrone,3a15wl,darkChozo,3,Tue Jun 16 14:15:31 2015 UTC,It could be that monsters grow while leveling up so they can handle more mutations.
NuclearThrone,3a15wl,LexicalGap17,11,Tue Jun 16 14:20:17 2015 UTC,"It'd ruin the styling of the game. You'd be trying to fit too much visual information into too little pixels, by the end of the run you'd be looking at a blob of colours if you tried displaying multiple ones at a time. Plus, there's 22 mutations that'd all be dependant on have a custom texture for every character, and every possible combination of textures for every character would lead to a metric fucktonne of artwork to do if they need adjusting.  On the other hand, what you've already done is pretty fuckin' rad.  Source: used to be a graphics designer."
NuclearThrone,3a15wl,Poshul,3,Tue Jun 16 15:36:26 2015 UTC,"You could do what Isaac does and combine when it makes sense, override otherwise. Like, you could do it based on slots -- looking though these sprites, I'm seeing shoulders/upperbodyshape, hat/headthing, eyes, chest/mouth, and then a lot of nonconflicting stuff.  Still would be a lot of work and would involve messing with the aesthetic. Plus, B skins would be weird. And I don't even know how you'd YV or Horror."
NuclearThrone,3a15wl,NotYourSagittarius,1 point,Wed Jun 17 08:56:13 2015 UTC,"I still think it's too much information on too few pixels. It works really well in Binding of Isaac because there's a lot more space to work with. Here, even with 'modular' skins, it would become too muddled too quickly and, like it was said elsewhere in this thread, you'd end up looking more like a clown than a sweet flying laser-shooting demon like you can in TBoI."

NuclearThrone,3a3wmt,scriblemelego,4,Wed Jun 17 01:00:55 2015 UTC,"Well, if you manage to bring a melee weapon or are crystal than you can neutralise the giant plasma balls, which are the primary danger of the throne.  You can also stand in the middle during the fight to cause it to use the beam, it'll give you a sound to warn you. I think it gives you some time to stop it using other attacks."
NuclearThrone,3a3wmt,Emc73,3,Wed Jun 17 01:15:54 2015 UTC,"If ammo is the problem, get Hunger or a melee weapon and bait the big green ball attack my staying near the sides of the level (so it doesn't do the laser attack). The balls drop ammo, and these things help you get to it.  If dying is the problem, try to stay in the middle to bait the laser attack, which is stupidly easy to dodge. As soon as it ends, go back to the middle, and often it'll just repeat it.  Also get good Throne weapons. Weapons like Lightning Rifle and Toxic Bow are crap against the Throne, while weapons like Triple Machinegun and other fast firing high DPS weapons are great."
NuclearThrone,3a3wmt,Dirst,2,Wed Jun 17 02:17:36 2015 UTC,"On my first time reaching the throne I had a blood cannon and energy sword.  On my third time I had a flame cannon and a lightning shotgun.  On my most recent attempt I had a plasma cannon and a seeker shotgun.  On that run I also killed the throne, but bled out just as the throne exploded (was playing as chicken).  Were these good weapons for the throne or not?  Is my problem the fact that I had a ""cannon"" weapon each time?  I'm assuming they weren't good choices as most of these weapons are slow firing, but I wanted to make sure."
NuclearThrone,3a3wmt,SwordSaint892,3,Wed Jun 17 02:34:22 2015 UTC,"Energy Sword+Blood Cannon could have been godlike. Be careful about your dodges and use the Energy Sword to kill off the big green balls, Blood Cannon to deal the main damage while also neutralizing some of it's shots.    Seeker Shotgun is just an all around super amazing weapon that's good at everything, just make sure you have bolts by the time you kill the Throne.    Flame Cannon+Lightning Shotgun was probably just asking to die on the Throne, no great single target DPS there.    I don't really like Plasma Cannon/Super Plasma Cannon on the Throne because I hate how jittery they make the game in general (once time the Throne decided to step on me while the game was shaking), but they do a lot of damage with the main ball, you just have to be careful with your movement.    Sounds like your main problem might be dodging, which can be lessened by baiting the giant laser by standing on the main carpet.    Good luck, you've gotten to the Throne a few times pretty early playtime wise, shouldn't be too much longer until you have it figured out."
NuclearThrone,3a3wmt,TheSilverSpiral,2,Wed Jun 17 09:10:21 2015 UTC,"Keep calm and dodge! Melee helps. Even if you find a Wrench before the throne, it helps a ton. Hit the big balls. But don't get too greedy with the ammo/health they drop since it can get you killed easily. Plutoneum Hunger is great for this. Try baiting the beam attack by standing in the carpet for a little to get some breathing room and some free hits.. With Chicken, you may want to throw any extra weapons you find up to where you'll be doing the fighting to avoid running out of ammo, since running back to the start can usually get you trapped. Hammerhead might also be helpful, but I have never personally used it on the Throne so idk. The Blood Cannon/Launcher is amazing for the throne fight since it destroys projectiles. I usually play on 50% screenshake because it was getting me killed on the throne fight a lot, so that might be worth looking into. Hope this helps. Above all, keep calm!"
NuclearThrone,3a3wmt,LITTLE-GUNTER,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:14:39 2015 UTC,"Try with Horror. His beam can destroy the giant balls, so you don't need to bring a melee weapon. Try energy weapons with Laser Brain as well, increasing ammo efficiency and damage."

NuclearThrone,3a1xtm,TwentySharks,8,Wed Jun 17 01:26:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was Lil' Hunter. He spawns in the third level of the Frozen City(typically known as 5-3) after a certain amount of time has passed. He's got low health for a boss but can dodge like a pro and dishes out crazy amounts of bullet hell.  That said, let's do some math here. Lil' Hunter has 120 health and the Assault Slugger deals 22 damage with each bullet and fires three of them. Since you used a Throne Butt-boosted Pop Pop you fired 12 shots in an instant, meaning you dealt approximately 264 damage to him.  No wonder he kind of died.  Kudos to you for already making it to the Frozen City, by the way. It's not uncommon for new players to have trouble getting past the Sewers, let alone the Scrapyard."

NuclearThrone,3a1xtm,TwentySharks,-3,Wed Jun 17 01:27:21 2015 UTC,"Throne-butt pop pop makes you fire 4 shots, not twelve, which means he did 88 damage to him.

NuclearThrone,3a1xtm,Harakou,13,Tue Jun 16 21:34:52 2015 UTC,"The Assault Slugger fires three shots in a burst and Pop Pop causes you to fire twice, which doubles the amount of the projectiles, or in this case quadruples.  Hence, 12 shots."

NuclearThrone,39yxok,BioOnPC,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:40:17 2015 UTC,"Well, the small team we have going has been talking about levels. The one that's being most talked about won't actually be a normal level where you go just by defeating each level before, it will be either A. a secret, or B. something like the Crown Vaults. It might be added once 9j has more of a grip on GML."

NuclearThrone,39yxok,Mate9,2,Tue Jun 16 01:30:23 2015 UTC,Changing a game from 30fps to 60fps in Game Maker is pretty much hell because game ticks and frames are tied together.

NuclearThrone,3a0cxe,Fox0427,3,Tue Jun 16 06:10:02 2015 UTC,"I'd tap that knife.  EITHER WAY: The concept is nice, and so is the sprites!...  But he is a bit TOO similiar to Chicken. Allow me to explain. His title screen sprite when not selected, is staring into the abyss. Chicken's title screen sprite when not select, is almost the same, expect she is sitting, and watching TV. Both of them start with the melee, and both of them use sharp weapons. [katana, knife.] His special is like nowaday's weapon throw, expect controlled, and balanced.His throne butt is NOT REALLY similiar to chicken, but Spritual flame is like Chicken's Ultra A before update 77. But again; Ultra B is not really the same. The backstory is pretty good though! Good work!"
NuclearThrone,3a0cxe,Akosss,2,Tue Jun 16 09:55:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he is a little similar to Chicken. I really like melee (thus the melee character) and I couldn't think of a fitting weapon other than the knife. I wasn't sure what to do with his title screen thing and thought it would be epic if he turned around and levitated the knife in the air, so that's what I did. The special... Well I wasn't sure what to do really, but since I liked the idea of starting with a cursed weapon I thought it would be cool to do something with the cursed weapon, and that's all I could think of. When it comes to the ultra, I have never actually made it to level ultra on any character before nor have I seen what Chicken's old ultras were. That one is pure coincidence. Thanks for the feedback!"
NuclearThrone,3a0cxe,Akosss,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:09:53 2015 UTC,"Chicken's old ultras were:  Ultra A: Determination [Throws pierce, now thronebutt.] Ultra B: Harder to kill [Kills reset death clock.]"
NuclearThrone,3a0cxe,Akosss,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:11:49 2015 UTC,Hmm... I fail to see how Spiritual Flame is similar to Determination... Could you explain?
NuclearThrone,3a0cxe,Akosss,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:15:10 2015 UTC,"Well let me compare: Spritual flame increases damage, and speed for the special of Kitsune's. Chicken's almost does the same, since there is an almost impossible to see little speed increase in her throw. Piercing may not have flames, but its almost like the same. Well only for me, it seems."
NuclearThrone,3a0cxe,Yanthir,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:25:20 2015 UTC,"Hm. The only similarities I'm seeing is a speed boost that is apparently unnoticeable which makes me doubt it's even actually there. It's like when your in some random game and you hold shift and swear that it makes you a little faster, but actually doesn't. A placebo kind of thing. I dunno, maybe it is there. Plus I'm pretty sure pierce did not increase damage either."
NuclearThrone,3a0cxe,Yanthir,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:34:22 2015 UTC,"By damage i meant damage output. As in how much damage will it deal. Like, let me try to explain. Let's say, you throw your Screwdriver that deals 15 dammage / hit. It hits the enemy 2 times, it will deal 30 damage. Something  like this."
NuclearThrone,3a0cxe,Yanthir,2,Tue Jun 16 10:37:33 2015 UTC,I personally think throwing a weapon and controlling a lawnmower are entirely different things.
NuclearThrone,3a0cxe,Yanthir,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:44:23 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. But there are a few other ultras that increase damage output too, is there not? And what's wrong with some extra damage anyways? Well, either way, if you think you know how it can be improved let me know! I'll tell you what I think :)"
NuclearThrone,3a0cxe,THEVitorino,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:46:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, and btw tapping the active button would do nothing for you. You take the damage as long as the knife is away from you, not as long at the active is in use."
NuclearThrone,3a0cxe,QTheNew42Q,2,Tue Jun 16 15:07:50 2015 UTC,I think the damage taken over time would make this guy quite useless. It also makes Ultra A useless. But I love the concept. Maybe change it so that he get's slowed down when he uses his active? That would make dodging a tricky case.
NuclearThrone,3a0cxe,Marzipan_Fan,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:47:16 2015 UTC,"Hm... I'm trying to think of a way around this. I might just increase the time in between, maybe to five seconds. I mean, in your head, five seconds doesn't seem like much, but if you use a stop watch to actually see how long it is you could off a quite a few enemies in NT in five seconds. What do you think?"
NuclearThrone,3a0cxe,PosthistoricDino,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:53:56 2015 UTC,"That might work, but you'd have to add a way to heal up since there would be no incentive to use this ability due to it's risk. For example, Rogue's clones take 1-2 hp and they can get rid of quite a lot of enemies. Especially on Throne Butt. And Rogue heals for half her health after every level.  All I'm saying is that losing health is quite a big cost. Maybe you could do something like it hurts you every 2 seconds of controlling the blade and the first tick is after the first 4 seconds, so it is worth using but forces you to pay a cost at overuse?"

NuclearThrone,39z78e,TheSilverSpiral,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's partially based on difficulty, partially just fuck you rng.

But it's probably not only rng either, since there seem to be way more IDPD after a few loops."

NuclearThrone,39ze9r,TalixZero,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:08:39 2015 UTC,"I really like the concept of this as a whole, even if they don't necessarily seem to fit in with the current direction of the game (the Komodo Dragon actually could work as a fun loop alteration, I could see it in-game)  Komodo Dragon is a cool idea as a pet leashed by Big Bandit, no real issues here.  My main question about the Large Maggot is how are you supposed to damage it? It sounds like it spends most of the time underground and only comes out to attack before disappearing again, and in addition to that it heals underground? Doesn't sound very fun or interesting imo.  The Spirit boss would be cool, just in a different game. The reality is that in Nuclear Throne, by the time someone has looped several times they can almost definitely just spray the entire stage with damage at will, killing the spirits without much interesting interaction.  I'm looking forward to more ideas about loop-exclusive encounters though."

NuclearThrone,39yfhu,Snakekitty,7,Mon Jun 15 20:28:06 2015 UTC,"Melee Steroids is great. I play him a lot.   The biggest thing to remember is that enemies in their ""damaged"" animations/frames can't be hurt by melee. Keep it in mind always. In particular, you can't hit an enemy with 2 melee weapons at once, which is something Steroids usually has going for him with other weapons.  Really good mutations are Stress, Boiling Veins, Euphoria, Impact Wrists, and anything that adds survivability like Blood Lust, Rhino Skin, and Rabbit Paw.  Trigger fingers can be useful if you have slow reload weapons, but it offsets your rhythm if you just hold both mouse buttons down.  Sharp Teeth and Gamma Guts can be useful, but remember the damage frames thing and how if fucks up melee.  You'll need Plutonium Hunger less, since you'll be near the enemies more than normal. You absolutely don't need Back Muscle or Lucky Shot obviously. You should probably also skip Eagle Eyes.  Crown of Guns makes it easier to find the weapon combo you want, and you don't care about ammo anyway until you get Energy Melee weapons  Because of Steroid's accuracy loss, Shovels cover pretty much everywhere around you. It's pretty good once you have Trigger Fingers."
NuclearThrone,39yfhu,Spars,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:54:10 2015 UTC,"No Long Arms? I'm a big fan of Long Arms especially for shovel usage...since I tend to prefer Shovel I also find Scarier Face to be really helpful since it turns some 3-shots into 2-shots and 2-shots into 1-shots (Crystal Spiders namely)    Also, Plutonium Hunger can be useful if you're using Crown of Blood, sometimes bullet storms/general clusterfucks can get too hectic...wouldn't Back Muscle help for Energy Weapons as well?"
NuclearThrone,39yfhu,Gjones18,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:02:51 2015 UTC,"It was so obvious I forgot to mention it. Long Arms is the melee-specific mutation of course.

What OP meant with...   Vlambeer might actually put a branch on Steam for update 20 for modding purposes.   ...is that the devs might release Update 20's files for modders to decompile as a Steam branch. From Rami's email sent to me:   ""If you can limit the files you distribute to those modified by the mod, that'd be great. There are complicated copyright issues with distribution the audio or other data files. We can make update 20 available to Steam users ourselves on a branch, if you wish.""

This is pretty much the reason that Y.V's Back 2 Bizniz is kind of bad.  It needs to be more permanent, something like ""Gain full health and some ammo if you enter a level exit portal with 1 or less health.""

A lot of times I've gotten into that last portal with barely any health, or very little ammo, or both, and Last Wish was there to save the day.

This is probably the hardest area in the game in terms of difficulty scaling. In other words, it's awesome!"
NuclearThrone,39sgmz,Jebidijed,4,Sun Jun 14 13:02:21 2015 UTC,Yep. All you need is a melee weapon tho and you can survive.
NuclearThrone,39sgmz,HaplessHobo,6,Sun Jun 14 13:49:30 2015 UTC,A Seeker weapon tends to be pretty useful too... if you're some kind of a massive scrub who can't aim... like me.

Oasis lets you skip from 1-1 to 3-3, which saves a lot of time.  The Pizza Sewer is easy and doesn't skip any levels, so you get an extra set of chests and +1 Difficulty.  Y.V.'s Mansion has a Golden Weapon Chest.  But the Jungle has no special rewards, skips exactly one level (so it neither saves time nor increases the difficulty number), is more difficult than the level it replaces, and costs a whole mutation to enter."

NuclearThrone,39sgmz,Problematicar,3,Sun Jun 14 09:19:52 2015 UTC,Yes like let me try to explain:  The spawn was like a square expect a few blocks at the front destroyed. The plant was like blocking the spawn front but you can go through it. So i decided to like feed it. Then we know what happens.

Quite interesting, basically its shots work like slugger shots (they travel a decently small distance and lose momentum quick) but it fires a lot of them like a shotgun, has quite a good fire rate as well, not slow as I thought it would be.

NuclearThrone,39saqk,robertreaves,2,Sun Jun 21 20:11:24 2015 UTC,"The changes help but I still don't think chicken's ability is that useful without the new ultra. With throne butt and no ultra B it feels okay but I'm still just throwing my guns around to try it out, never because it feels like it would really help me out. With ultra B the throw seems decent though I would probably still take ultra A over it. There is a delay when the gun teleports back to you where you can't switch to the gun you just threw, probably to avoid you just spam throwing the same weapon."

NuclearThrone,39smxi,Dirst,3,Sun Jun 14 16:08:38 2015 UTC,I guess they really wanted people to pick the worst mutation in the game.
NuclearThrone,39smxi,TwentySharks,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:17:56 2015 UTC,"It isn't the worst mutation anymore if it brings you to a level full of experience and weapons, now is it?"
NuclearThrone,39smxi,thefrdeal,3,Sun Jun 14 18:40:30 2015 UTC,Or you could pick any other Mutation and go to 5-2 instead. That level is full of weapons and experience as well.
NuclearThrone,39smxi,TwentySharks,2,Sun Jun 14 19:58:39 2015 UTC,"The idea is that The Jungle is much harder and more rewarding, giving you double the experience of 5-2 plus a triple weapons chest"

NuclearThrone,39ujde,TwentySharks,3,Sun Jun 14 22:13:15 2015 UTC,"Don't like either of these suggestions.  If YV were to get any change, it should be a renewable part to Back 2 Bizniz. Maybe an option to return there at the end of every level when you have max rads, at the cost of all your rads (so you can probably go there every couple of levels, and less often if you're using Ultra weapons or not picking up rads.)"
NuclearThrone,39ujde,Dirst,5,Mon Jun 15 01:01:51 2015 UTC,replaces all weapon chests with Crib weapon chests.   nope.txt
NuclearThrone,39ujde,Problematicar,3,Sun Jun 14 22:34:18 2015 UTC,Perhaps it could replace triple chests with crib chests?

NuclearThrone,39ujde,atrain99,2,Mon Jun 15 00:20:24 2015 UTC,"I like both of them currently. I love the faster fire rate with Ima gun god and back 2 bizniz, while not a great Ultra, sends you to YV's crib, which is most awesome place in the game right now.  The new ima gun god makes pop pop useless and back 2 bizniz is way too OP. I don't like your suggestions. I agree that back 2 bizniz should be changed somewhat, but ima gun god is perfectly fine as it is."
NuclearThrone,39ujde,professorMaDLib,2,Mon Jun 15 00:21:55 2015 UTC,"Ima Gun God is good enough to stay as how it is. I mean, 60% less reload time is PRETTY good if you think about it. Back 2 Bizniz should maybe make you able to go to the criv using the car in the scrapyard"

NuclearThrone,39slql,Akosss,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:49:23 2015 UTC,"Not sure, it may be something to do with HP, or Mutation Choice. waiting for another guy who made it to reply to my question.  And actually, do you remember what mutations you picked?"

NuclearThrone,39seb2,mrbasta,2,Sun Jun 14 09:11:58 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it was already there, but Vlambeer could have already planned this out."
NuclearThrone,39seb2,Spoopyro,3,Sun Jun 14 09:12:58 2015 UTC,"We know it can be like the mansion, use a weapon on a object. we know it can be like the sewers, blow stuff up to reveal a portal. we know it can be beating a boss fast. My guess is that this is something new, because all secret areas unlock differently.  there is a secret entrance in the wasteland, sewers and scrapyard. wouldn't it be obvious if the next entrance was in the crystal caves?  //edit  I guess there is a crystal caves secret area?"
NuclearThrone,39seb2,buster2Xk,3,Sun Jun 14 08:37:49 2015 UTC,It could be the snow city since almost all the secret areas are the opposite of each other.
NuclearThrone,39seb2,DerpyDoseGamez,5,Sun Jun 14 08:48:06 2015 UTC,"Desert/Oasis is obvious.  Sewers/Pizza because sewers smell awful and pizza smells nice. The loading screens said so.   Junkyard/Mansion because being rich is the opposite of living in a dump?  Crystal Caves/Cursed Caves are inverted, the colors are opposite.  Frozen City/Jungle because there ""used to be"" trees in the Frozen City. Also, a big city is a concrete jungle.  Definitely all opposites so far."

NuclearThrone,39seb2,Akosss,3,Sun Jun 14 08:49:37 2015 UTC,"Just finished Frozen City, couldn't find a Vending Machine.  I would assume if that was what lead to the secret area, they would increase the spawn rate."

NuclearThrone,39seb2,baphometer-,2,Sun Jun 14 08:38:02 2015 UTC,Good work aaaaaand holy shit the camo bandits are cooool!
NuclearThrone,39seb2,Akosss,2,Sun Jun 14 08:43:43 2015 UTC,"I can explain what does enemies do:  The flying huge ass bug shoots maggots at you. I'm not joking.  It shoots maggots that when hit you or hit a wall, they will become normal maggots.  The camoflagued bandits shoot at you at insane speed with a rather recolour of normal revolver bullets expect fully white. And the bullets DO bounce. But they dont go really far. The most closest thing that can like make you imagine that how fasts it shoots, it shoots just as fast as a popgun.  The Assassins in a bush act like a prop until you go near them or attack then. They follow you and hit you with a melee like normal Assassins.  Note: Normal bandits still spawn. The camoflauged ones are completely different than normal bandits."
NuclearThrone,39seb2,baphometer-,2,Sun Jun 14 09:37:40 2015 UTC,"YEAH, IT'S REAL.  FOUND SPRITES RELATING TO THE ENEMIES IN THE AREA"
NuclearThrone,39seb2,Akosss,2,Sun Jun 14 08:25:17 2015 UTC,"I have no idea whatsoever, but I am also on the hunt and I'm thinking... Something to do with the consoles in the laboratory, and the fact that there are plant based monsters there. Likewise, you can interact with the vending machine in the snow level, but that doesn't really have a thematic link... I'm thinking it's something to do with the labs because of the plant clones. But how you access it and why (thematically) I really don't know. Likewise, I was thinking that maybe the crown vault is located in a jungle, seeing as it has that Indiana Jones vibe, so maybe there will be a way out added?  The other option could be that some trigger (like Y.Vs flying car) will be added somewhere in the game. I'm unsure whether it will be somewhere where there isn't already an alternative route (sewers, wasteland, junkyard, cursed caves) or whether they'll give us the option to take one route or the other from a level. I dunno."
NuclearThrone,39seb2,Akosss,2,Sun Jun 14 08:35:08 2015 UTC,"Well, it's proven to be in the game.  So it's search time."

NuclearThrone,39q40y,Siniroth,2,Sat Jun 13 20:17:00 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind something like the 'shops' in Risk of Rain. Three pedestals you can pick from and the other two disappear. Could either be a rad trade or just a straight up 'pick one'

The snare ability helps to make the charging enemies easier to deal with(rats, crystal spiders, snowbot etc), it's good for making bosses stay at one place and the thronebutt make any boss a piece of cake. The snare also act as a light source in dark levels. Not to mention the snare can block fire traps.   Also you should try bolt marrow if you haven't already. It helps alot with aiming and crowd control."

But more often than not it's just playing more and more.  Mutations are somewhat subjective but the top-tier ones for just surviving are these (in no particular order)  Strong Spirit  Rabbit's Paw  Second Stomach  Bloodlust  Guns/weapons are player preference"
NuclearThrone,39o4l3,Lucky1291,2,Sat Jun 13 04:13:39 2015 UTC,I'm curious why people like Strong Spirit. It's always just felt like a less consistent Rhino Skin to me.  It basically lets you take one more hit.  I'd also add Plutonium Hunger to top tier.  That extra range for grabbing ammo and health makes everything so much safer.
NuclearThrone,39o4l3,Fleshmaster,3,Sat Jun 13 09:46:49 2015 UTC,"The idea is that, especially combined with second stomach and rabbit's paw, you can get back to full health assuming you survive that extra hit, and you get an extra hit every time. The extreme case is with melting, if you get hit with 2 health you die, if you have SS you survive and need a single medkit to get that chance again. If you're new/not very good, alway sick rhino skin over it, but as you have longer runs you will realise that it is a very helpful and could save your runs more often than not."
NuclearThrone,39o4l3,rlh1994,2,Sat Jun 13 11:08:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, I think I fall firmly into the not very good category, but I'm getting better.  Maybe I'll give it a try again, your reasoning makes sense."
NuclearThrone,39o4l3,Fleshmaster,2,Sat Jun 13 18:38:53 2015 UTC,"I'm finally at the point where it's a toss up between rhino skin and SS now, just keep working at it and play around with mutations and weapons and you'll always be improving. As an example my best run today was with a bazooka, never used it before, but it worked well for me (admittedly I had boiling veins)!"
NuclearThrone,39o4l3,rlh1994,2,Sat Jun 13 22:57:57 2015 UTC,"With any game, you get better with experience. But what helps me a lot is mutation selection.   Many have said Crystal is a good character to start as, for she has slightly more HP with her shielding right click skill.   Now, what mutations I try to pick every run are ones that help prolong lifetime, such as Rhino skin, bloodlust, Strong spirit. More must have mutations are scarier face, Rabbits paw, back muscle, and plutonium hunger. Outside of these, it's up to play style and how to build your character. Certain mutations work better with other characters like sharp teeth with rebel and trigger fingers with Y.V., and eagle eyes with Steroids (but it isn't bad to get if there isn't anything else better to choose.)  As for play style, I try to stick with a spamming weapon and a hard hitter. This changes with people like steroids, who dual wields so you can have to spam weapons which will work fine if you build him right, or a spam weapon and a melee weapon to soak up incoming bullets.   I also like robot for he finds better guns early on. That's just me.   I hope this helps out!"

NuclearThrone,39o4l3,Hypnodick,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:28:45 2015 UTC,"If you have a choice between losing rads, or losing health, lose the rads. All enemies drop rads, not all of them drop health.  Also, if you want to get better at dodging quickly, run into the middle of every crowd of enemies you encounter. This is something that will get you killed, but it will also force you to learn how to dodge."

NuclearThrone,39ncm1,ryvenn,2,Sat Jun 13 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm. What about ""Enrichment: Radiation improves guns."" Collecting rads levels up your weapons. So if you hold a Crossbow long enough, it will eventually become an Auto Crossbow or Heavy Crossbow, or if you hold a Sledgehammer long enough it eventually becomes a Lightning Hammer. Weapons could have different upgrade paths, and when one becomes eligible to level up you could choose what it levels into in the portal between levels, the way you choose mutations. Or it could be random between all the possibilities, to keep the game more action-oriented and less GUI."

NuclearThrone,39ivdk,9joao6,2,Fri Jun 12 14:35:03 2015 UTC,We'll be releasing the version SleepCycles played (along with a few bug fixes and a bit of balancing) when we get the devs' permission. :)

D:    I've noticed that Crown of Hatred only procs if you walk over the chest, so if you want the contents but can't risk the damage, you can try to open the portal near whatever chest you need. The Rad canister will cost HP and give you more rads if you step on it, but it WON'T if you break it with a weapon. I haven't checked to see if Crown of Hatred can kill you yet. [EDIT: apparently it has no problem killing you now]. Like it was before, Crown of Hatred is pretty damn good on Rebel because of her recovery in portals."

NuclearThrone,39hmma,Code_Ze_ro,9,Fri Jun 12 11:17:33 2015 UTC,"For me it'd have to be any of the slug weapons. To be specific, the gatling slugger. I honestly can't think of any downsides to it besides ammo consumption, but that could be easily covered by a reliable secondary, and a number of mutations. A close second would be the auto crossbow."
NuclearThrone,39hmma,GetDECIMATED,8,Thu Jun 11 20:07:14 2015 UTC,Do you feel the need to Gatle? It's always time for a bit of a Gatle.

NuclearThrone,39hmma,Spars,7,Thu Jun 11 20:07:27 2015 UTC,"SPC is the obvious answer for a Fish player, but that's not very interesting.  I'd say the Shotgun. Getting one in 1-1 lets me not have to worry about picking up new weapons for half the game. Only really need to consider new weapons in late Frozen City so I have something good to get through Palace, but before that, Shotgun is super versatile and great for everything.  Obviously not the best weapon in the game, but I'm lazy and being able to rely on one weapon for a long time is nice."

NuclearThrone,39hmma,Yanthir,5,Thu Jun 11 22:09:51 2015 UTC,"Pop Gun/Seeker Pistol. The Pop Gun has pretty stupidly high DPS early game, and the larger projectiles make it easy to hit things with. Plus it's just stupid in the sewers.  The Seeker Pistol is a weapon that can easily carry me pretty far. It deals pretty good damage and the homing shots make spam a very easy thing to do. The only real downside to it is that you cant use it around corners or in tight corridors all that well."

NuclearThrone,39hmma,Code_Ze_ro,3,Fri Jun 12 11:19:31 2015 UTC,"Auto Crossbow. It can spawn early enough to be useful on lots of stages as soon as you need a weapon like that. It is really rewarding for players with good aim. It is SUPER rewarding with Bolt Marrow. It's useful against everything in the game except maybe Guardian Dogs, the Throne and the tanky loop bosses.    Heavy Auto Crossbow is great too, but I like the smaller resource cost of Auto Crossbow.    Runner Up: Shovel with Long Arms and Scarier Face, as well as Ultra Shovel which is lightweight overpowered."
NuclearThrone,39hmma,SwordSaint892,3,Fri Jun 12 00:39:22 2015 UTC,"Now I'm not one of your fancy looping players, but seeing a plain Crossbow drop just feels like meeting an old friend at the pub for a pint."

NuclearThrone,39hmma,SwordSaint892,2,Fri Jun 12 11:21:59 2015 UTC,Definitively the Blood Cannon for me. High damage and high utility coupled with a decent firing speed makes it a very powerful weapon. And since I play Rebel a lot it has the added bonus of being arguably the best weapon for protecting your allies.
NuclearThrone,39hmma,moonra_zk,2,Thu Jun 11 20:30:43 2015 UTC,"Heavy Crossbow, but only with Trigger Fingers and Bolt Marrow. Otherwise... I don't really know, the Auto weapons are pretty damn awesome, including the Gatling Slugger which is kinda an auto gun too.  Oh, and Energy Sword, definitely."

NuclearThrone,39hmma,TheSilverSpiral,3,Fri Jun 12 00:49:21 2015 UTC,"Must be sooooo satisfying on the transition levels, the heavy bolt's lower speed is already amazing at making the homing amazingly effective."

NuclearThrone,39e8uc,TSED,15,Thu Jun 11 03:52:20 2015 UTC,Right now she's the hard mode character and that's fine.  What you're suggesting is turning her into an almost completely different game.
NuclearThrone,39e8uc,j-dag,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:43:45 2015 UTC,"What you're suggesting is turning her into an almost completely different game.   Yes, that was somewhat intentional.  It feels more her style, and it could still be pretty hard.  If you want an explicitly hardmode-but-still-the-same-style character... well, it couldn't be that hard to introduce a new one?  The basics of the playing have been laid down already, so it's mostly a few tweaks and a new sprite.  My biggest issue is more that playing her mechanically doesn't feel like playing her fluff.  The way she actually plays is enjoyable, but it doesn't feel like she's on the run from the IDPD."
NuclearThrone,39e8uc,Foxyladyz,4,Thu Jun 11 06:48:38 2015 UTC,"Personally, I hate the current active. The heat passive is supposed, as you said, to make Rogue constantly have to move in order to survive, but the active we have right now is literally a portable cover creator, since the damage a portal strike does is low ish, and using it for utility is way more viable. I think that the one who needed an active rework was Rogue, not Chicken."
NuclearThrone,39e8uc,WataugaCJ,5,Thu Jun 11 06:30:53 2015 UTC,"The Chicken rework made me go ""oh hey, Vlambeer is willing to rework characters!""  Which is why I bothered posting this at all.  I've been sitting on this idea for a while, but figured it wasn't worth wasting anyone's time with."
NuclearThrone,39e8uc,GreatAtlas,3,Thu Jun 11 06:49:28 2015 UTC,"I think this is actually pretty brilliant. Not only does it fit Rogue, but it is inherently balanced too.

NuclearThrone,39e8uc,Angus-is-a-goose,2,Sat Jun 13 18:22:15 2015 UTC,The only thing I can think that I DON'T like about this is that you could just flash through a boss or such. Maybe you need to fill the bar all the way to generate a portal? And only on non-essential stages?
NuclearThrone,39e8uc,QTheNew42Q,5,Thu Jun 11 22:19:51 2015 UTC,"To that end, I simply recommend having the boss drop the rad cannister."

NuclearThrone,39cqm7,zanderthedestroyer,10,Wed Jun 10 22:11:37 2015 UTC,"You don't know what's offscreen on 3 maps, thats sewers, crystal caves and the labs, which is like 33-40% of a loop."

NuclearThrone,39cqm7,bigdooraoc,-1,Thu Jun 11 02:12:19 2015 UTC,Only on looping. I don't think a basic character should have a passive that only really applies to those who can loop to the Sewers and beyond.

If you have full health or Strong Spirit you can survive a hit from them but you rarely take only one hit because of the way contact damage works currently.  That said I want to remember that they have said they want the Palace to not be as populated as it is currently is but that all enemies are mini-bosses.

NuclearThrone,39du2t,minichibis,8,Thu Jun 11 02:18:07 2015 UTC,"Before I write this up, I want to say that I like most of your ideas a lot! However, I have a few bits of critique:   MERCY INVINCIBILITY. I'm sorry guys, but this is necessary in one form or another. I don't want to have a good run ended by a rat or maggot going unnoticed for literally ONE second. The wastelands may be merciless, but the world of game balance is not.   A lot of people complain about this, and I might be alone on my stance here, but I think that the ability to take damage shouldn’t be buffed in the least. The lack of invincibility frames is a defining factor in what makes the game so unforgivingly brutal. I love how freaks might combo a bunch of damage onto you before you know it, how an unnoticed rat can be just as much of a run-ender as a hulking guardian dog.  I can see why it can be off-putting to some players, though—it makes runs less consistent. But in my opinion, the game isn’t meant to be all that consistent. Sometimes things go well. Other times, you have to shoulder through the RNG.   Less touch damage on scorpions and crystals: These guys just float randomly, and having one collide with you can frustratingly end a run in a way that makes it not seem like your fault.   I agree on the scorpions, since their movement is so erratic. But crystals are really slow, so I think it makes sense for them to deal so much contact damage. They act like little pillars that you have to avoid when you’re running around. And the post-loop crystal caves boss would be a whole lot less scary if the crystals couldn’t one-hit you.   World gen changes: I find myself having the most tense fun in long hallways, and hate having large open spaces, especially in areas like the scrapyards where bullets fly around liberally. While every other area has world gen that feels fair, the scrapyard just feels a bit un-fun. I can't say anything about labs or beyond, because I never got there, but I can say that out of all the areas, scrap yard generation feels sadistic.   I’d hate to see the scrapyard changed. It’s the only part of the game (besides the throne) that really focuses on bullet hell, and it’d be a lot blander if they got rid of that. A tad more cover might be nice, though, and the difficulty of the big dog level seems disproportionately high.   If you visited a secret area, it's foes will face you on loops: Just to add to the chaos.   I’m not a huge fan of this one. In my opinion, the fact that you can only face the special enemies for a minute portion of the game is what makes the secret areas so fun and worthwhile to visit.   More ""champion"" enemies: These foes put dread in any player's heart. It would be fun to see golden snipers, shadowy assassins, walkers which shoot even more bullets, and other, weirder things. Variety is the spice of life, after all.   👍 👍 petition vlambeer 2015   More unique crystal caves enemies: I dunno, I just feel that even one more unique enemy could make the caves into a really standout level where the fear of death is real, like the sewers, instead of just a mere transition level. The same could also go for the icy wastelands and the palace. Or you could plop some past level enemies in there and at least add a bit more variety.   Definitely. A lot of the levels seem to have a mechanical focus, like rats dashing at you in tight hallways, or hordes of minions being revived by necromancers. The crystal caves, frozen city, and palace all feel a bit nebulous in comparison.   HARD MODE: something that would ramp up the difficulty, such as no rad canisters, more enemy spawn, more champions, less drops, more enemy health, and initial IDPD spawn (or in Rouge's case, way ramped up IDPD spawn) could really challenge tougher players.   I think the one-size-fits-all difficulty curve is one of the strongest qualities of the game, but additional options are never bad. I think you’re supposed to be able to do this with crowns, but they try (and fail) to make the crowns balanced: in my opinion, I think some crowns should just augment your run for the better, while some simply make it harder."
NuclearThrone,39du2t,Puzzlesque,3,Thu Jun 11 04:52:55 2015 UTC,"There is mercy invincibility in the game, though. It's not very long at all--It only lasts like 5 frames, but it's there. You can't be hit by two bullets at the exact same time, and you won't instantly go from 8 to 0 if a rat touches you like you would if it wasn't there.  And that's fine. That amount of mercy is just fine."
NuclearThrone,39du2t,BowsOhNo,6,Thu Jun 11 17:01:11 2015 UTC,"Why would you want to make the game easier? Nuclear Throne is a game that punishes you harshly for your mistakes, and a lot of your suggestions take away from that.

Once you can get past those two obstacles it's pretty much a free loop."

NuclearThrone,39du2t,LazliiX,2,Thu Jun 11 15:48:22 2015 UTC,"Good ideas for the most part! My disagreements:   I won't belabor the point, I'm sure you've heard the counterarguments Actually, all of the floaty guys follow the same AI (except scorpions, which run away). After playing the game for a long time, it's not hard to dodge. I really like the way nuclear throne does bosses actually - the simple 2-attack boss. Not really designed to take your full attention, just a rather difficult enemy mixed in with the others. This game should be less about the boss fight to me.   12: I don't like hard modes like this because it's just boring, artificial difficulty. I would play it, but only for macho man points - no rad canisters is NOT more fun. I mean I guess it doesn't hurt to have the option, but I'd rather the devs focused on things like improving difficulty scaling, making late-game more interesting, making more challenging characters like melting, etc. Maybe less drops as the game goes on?"

NuclearThrone,399joa,Batteryhorse,8,Wed Jun 10 06:02:14 2015 UTC,"Melting's is a bit confusing. Lose one health to get every mutation? What? I'm very confused by what this means and you didn't explain it at all. Also, if it is what I think it is, it's terrible and doesn't fit with the rest of the effects.  I like the ""even more"" side to this mutation. Some of these can be tweaked to accommodate for this. Like Melting's:  Melting: Even more XP   Simpler and doesn't have a downside. Almost no mutations have a downside beside ultras, and these are not ultras. Horror's can be more mutations, but to keep it from being absolute shit, it might be a kind of second Patience, and lets you reroll with more mutation options. Also, Steroids should be giving you maybe half of a mini chest for each weapon type. Finally, Rogue's should have to do with blast armor, and not police, since the police might be helpful, now, for health and ammo droppings. Probably something like a bigger blast radius."
NuclearThrone,399joa,elitelol22,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:37:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry. I wrote this at 1 in the morning and didn't really think my explanations through. Anyways, what I meant is that Melting's passive buff would be to immediately shoot to Level 10 at the cost of setting their health to 1/1. Just giving more XP doesn't work IMO, because then you're spending a mutation slot in order to get others slightly faster. Doesn't really work for me.  Having Horror's be more like Patience, expanding the options to 6 mutations without costing one, would work really well! It'd be a welcome addition to almost any run.  Why half a mini chest? That means gaining 4 bolts, 13 bullets, stuff like that. Not much you can do with that amount at all, though I guess it would add up over time for the weapons you don't use... Hm.  Have they fixed the drop rate enough yet so that IDPD drops are worth it? That's a tricky issue, I guess, and mostly skill based. Anyways, bigger blast radius sounds much better. I'll fix up OP with some of your suggestions when I'm near a computer."
NuclearThrone,399joa,Picklemin,2,Wed Jun 10 16:29:04 2015 UTC,these seem kinda unnecessary  the ultras already handle passive ability upgrades pretty well for most characters

NuclearThrone,397i5s,thefrdeal,10,Tue Jun 9 20:32:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like the focus should shift from all weapons, to melee weapons. The current 15 damage is good for running out of ammo and tossing a gun, but melee weapons should have damage multipliers. The sword, in particular, should have a decent one. Piercing should be standard TB stuff, and for an ultra: either an enhanced, Link like glowing projectile effect is added with more damage, or a boomerang effect."

NuclearThrone,397i5s,Poshul,2,Wed Jun 10 04:31:18 2015 UTC,"Chicken's passive is amazing, and allows you to be more aggressive and rebound easily if you mess up. Especially with her ultra A  it's absurd."

NuclearThrone,397i5s,Farenor,2,Wed Jun 10 04:41:32 2015 UTC,"I am a huge fan of the concept of the new ability and I'm having a great time with it. I can do very cool stuff with the weapon throw and I love its concept, but after the junkyard it just gets useless. Thronebutt seems useless too and the Utlras I havent seen yet. So I like alot of your ideas. Some buff needs to happen but I'm a big fan of the general concept."
NuclearThrone,397i5s,Themanwiththeplan87,2,Tue Jun 9 21:34:41 2015 UTC,"In reference to the weapon throw idea, my friend came up with the thought that guns found in later levels or that are a lot rarer should do more damage. That way it scales in an acceptable manner."
NuclearThrone,397i5s,Battlesmit,4,Tue Jun 9 21:55:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like that would be a little nonsensical and overly complex. If you open a triple weapons chest, it would be nice to just throw the three weapons and have them all deal the same damage. Also, higher level weapons aren't necessarily heavier so its sort of nonsensical."
NuclearThrone,397i5s,Themanwiththeplan87,4,Tue Jun 9 22:57:15 2015 UTC,"I had the same thought as the guy above, its actually how I thought it would work right from the start. I agree it would be kind of nice to have all three weapons from a chest do the same damage, but I much prefer the damage variance/strategy that would come from thinking about which weapon you should throw. Also, saying its nonsensical doesn't mean it shouldn't exist, especially talking about a character who regrows her head after being shot, who uses a katanaNotToMentionSheIsAFreakingChicken."
NuclearThrone,397i5s,Nieue,2,Wed Jun 10 00:51:52 2015 UTC,"But the problem is, that leads to just an overall base damage which is not very good for things like loops. It would be good to have the damage scale in some way, otherwise Chicken is super weak late game."

You could release whenever you want but the longer you hold down the more damage it does. Obviously there should be some type of cap but i think charging the throw should make you vulnerable in some way, like slowing down your movement speed the longer you charge or something like that. (Just an idea I came up with today. Feel free to criticize :)"
NuclearThrone,397i5s,Crotchety_Young_Man,2,Wed Jun 10 00:13:31 2015 UTC,"I feel that would slow the game play down much like the old ability did, taking away from the experience of NT. Throwing stuff is more of a last ditch effort and really, I'd rather just shoot the dude instead of waiting to charge  a toss which I then get rid of my gun and have to get it back. Not worth/10"
NuclearThrone,397i5s,Rojas101,2,Wed Jun 10 00:53:55 2015 UTC,It could be a fast charge with a sweet spot for throwing damage - at that point it'd be basically equivalent to a laser cannon charge up if you threw at the first optimal point. I don't really know what my point is because I rarely take the laser cannon for that very reason but there it is.

Places a mine that releases fumes to attract enemies before exploding. All present I.D.P.D will attempt to destroy it before timed explosion. Besides releasing gas, it also releases an electric current similar to the Lightning Cannon. (Due to possible overpowered-ness of the weapon can only be found in the Sewers AFTER a loop).   Voila"
NuclearThrone,396g2y,LazliiX,2,Tue Jun 9 16:24:09 2015 UTC,"I like parts of this.  I definitely think that TB should make it do more damage and pierce, but I don't think it should boomerang.  The default should reflect, and Ultra B could be the boomerang thing.   Another side note:  SleepCycles mentioned this in one of his videos and I absolutely loved it.  If you throw a weapon while standing on or near another it should auto pick it up for you.  edit:  Also, as it stands I would never take the current UltraB.  Piercing almost sounds like a nerf to Chickens active since you have to go further to get your weapon back.  You should at least get a buff like much more damage to clear a path for you to go retrieve your weapon."

NuclearThrone,392ddd,JhoaoCkuNdari,3,Mon Jun 8 20:44:20 2015 UTC,It will be also amazing that higher tier weapons deal more damage when thrown. Just a random idea.
NuclearThrone,392ddd,MasterLuigi452,2,Mon Jun 8 23:35:18 2015 UTC,I think one of the devs mentioned that during the stream last Thursday. So I think they're either working on it or decided against it.
NuclearThrone,392ddd,Funklord_Earl,2,Mon Jun 8 21:29:18 2015 UTC,I think Chicken's throne butt or ultra should make thrown weapons return to her after an amount of time determined by the reload time of the gun. (IMO they should have just buffed his previous active)
NuclearThrone,392ddd,UpvotesGoHere,2,Tue Jun 9 00:04:08 2015 UTC,I want to see thrown screwdrivers get stuck in enemies that don't get killed outright by the blow.
NuclearThrone,392ddd,MeatPiston,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:25:31 2015 UTC,"I have a bit of a weird idea for this. Weapons should do more thrown damage based on what they are. Melee and huge weapons should do the most damage as they are either the heaviest or best at being thrown. Pistols and other small weapons should do enough damage to kill a rat or so. Medium weapons like shotguns and rifles should be able to kill birds or dogs on the ice caves. Alongside this I have an idea for making Long Arms better. Long Arms also allows the character to pick up weapons and open chests from a larger distance, meaning you could throw it and not have to risk being hit by bullets in some cases to pick your weapon back up."
NuclearThrone,392ddd,Azerate2,2,Mon Jun 8 23:43:08 2015 UTC,"I agree, maybe range could be the tradeoff - you can throw a pistol across the map and kill a scorpion but you can throw a Super Slugger 4 tiles and kill a guardian dog."

NuclearThrone,392ddd,Arc_Nexus,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:40:01 2015 UTC,"I feel like it would be better if it did more damage depending on how far in the game you found it. For example, a 1-1 weapon would do 20 damage, 2-1 would be 40, etc."
NuclearThrone,392ddd,JBroXNari99,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:44:52 2015 UTC,Should be based on weapon IMO. Super plasma cannon should deal quite a bit more damage than revolver when thrown.
NuclearThrone,3943f9,jazz-box,5,Tue Jun 9 02:57:23 2015 UTC,I think it'd be weird for Plutonium Hunger to do something extra for  Chicken but the same for everyone else. I think Throne Butt is the only one that acts different at all for every (/any) character unless I'm having a brain fart right now.
NuclearThrone,3943f9,SwordSaint892,2,Tue Jun 9 03:55:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The only mutations that act differently on characters are those that implicitly improve their abilities (Extra Feet on Plant, Euphoria on Eyes, Bloodlust on Chicken, etc.) and that's more of a value thing than a mechanical difference."
NuclearThrone,3943f9,Batteryhorse,2,Tue Jun 9 03:59:09 2015 UTC,I suggested in another thread about buffing his damage to also buff Long Arms to allow every character to actually have long arms. What this means is they can open chests from a greater distance (if they press X or E) and pick up weapons from a longer distance as well. Meaning it could become a bit more core for chicken like how Euphoria is less than core on someone like YV but much better on Eyes.
NuclearThrone,392w2f,Imagine_Baggins,8,Mon Jun 8 21:27:47 2015 UTC,"I honestly like it more than chicken's previous abilities but I agree, it needs something more, like more damage or that boomerang effect or something. Right now it's pretty trash against anything past sewers and is really only a good thing to use if you decide to pick up random weapons with long reload times, fire a shot and throw it."
NuclearThrone,392w2f,DusttoAshes,2,Mon Jun 8 22:13:29 2015 UTC,"Well, it's actually very good when you're in a tight spot with ammo. I kept having to throw my weapons and get more ammo by killing things with it. It can do a decent amount of damage, and since Chicken can die and come back so often in loops, it actually worked out very well."
NuclearThrone,392w2f,BioOnPC,2,Mon Jun 8 22:35:46 2015 UTC,"Apparently it does less than a crossbow, which is pretty garbage considering you can just pick one up"
NuclearThrone,392w2f,DusttoAshes,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:50:55 2015 UTC,"But what if the weapon is in a crowd of enemies? Or across the map? That's usually where other weapons are in loops, so it helps to have something to defend yourself when you run out of ammo. I wouldn't have made it through the Daily without the new active."
NuclearThrone,392w2f,BioOnPC,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:57:34 2015 UTC,"It's not completely useless as it does do wonders when ammo is short, but only when ammo is short and you can't get to a new gun. Every other active has a purpose, fish can roll out of the way of things, crystal can shield things, eyes can manipulate the battlefield, Y.V does a lot of damage in short bursts, etc. Chicken throws a weapon for 15 damage.read somewhere in another thread It's kind of underwhelming unless you've managed to get yourself in a situation you should not have ever gotten yourself into."
NuclearThrone,392w2f,DusttoAshes,-1,Tue Jun 9 01:29:06 2015 UTC,"Chicken, to me, as always been a ""Get out of jail free"" card. I mean, come on, you can die 8-12 times over, and then some. It only makes sense that she would have something to do practically the same, ammo-wise."
NuclearThrone,392w2f,BioOnPC,0,Tue Jun 9 01:46:22 2015 UTC,"No that one, that makes sense, I agree, chicken is the one that gets away with things, a character that lets you be an idiot and get away with it.  With that in mind this active is actually the thing chicken needed the most, perfect for the character that gets away with things."
NuclearThrone,392w2f,DusttoAshes,5,Tue Jun 9 01:49:15 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be cool if certain weapons did specific stuff when you threw them. So if you threw the lightning hammer, it would take from your energy pool and do the damage on impact. If you had no energy or not enough, it would be simply like a regular thrown weapon. Same applies to other weapons like that!"
NuclearThrone,392w2f,CommunistPrime,7,Tue Jun 9 02:26:12 2015 UTC,"I was hoping Chicken's Ultra B or Throne Butt would modify the Chicken Sword so that throwing it does like WAY extra damage or something, just to make the Chicken Sword have some neat effect to it."
NuclearThrone,392w2f,SwordSaint892,3,Tue Jun 9 05:12:23 2015 UTC,"That'd be awesome. Maybe have blunt weapons (or projectile weapons) knock back more, but bladed weapons do more damage (maybe one point more, or something scaleable)."
NuclearThrone,392w2f,CommunistPrime,3,Tue Jun 9 08:01:32 2015 UTC,Boomerang ultra with piercing I'd tap.
NuclearThrone,392w2f,Arc_Nexus,2,Tue Jun 9 05:36:11 2015 UTC,"I think it needs some tweaking, but I do like the concept. Even if you do already have good weapons, you'll find plenty lying around that suddenly become good for a nice throw. Hopefully it'll get some balancing put into it to make it a bit more interesting."
NuclearThrone,392w2f,Lancer873,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:46:06 2015 UTC,"I feel the same. It's low damage, a hassle, and generally I feel that it is lacking. The slow time with thronebutt was by far more useful.  I feel like people are just fawning over it because it's new. Hype train, etc."
NuclearThrone,392w2f,Beardalelist,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:21:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of the change at all. Slo-mo was helpful for getting into loop stages but this was obviously mitigated by the eventual draining of max HP the farther in you get. Grabbing a health pickup in the middle of bullet hell situations wouldn't do anything but buy you a few more seconds of headlessness, eventually ending at 0/0.   Chicken was my favorite character and she's pretty much ruined for me now :( Vlambeer, I love you guys to fucking death, but if you were going to make this change because slo-mo was buggy you should have done it like 20 updates ago"

Besides the big red mouth dudes from Y.V.'s mansion, I don't agree that the secret area enemies are any harder than the regular enemies. Even if they only appeared on late loops, I still think that all it would do is make the secret areas feel a little less special."

NuclearThrone,39293c,wour,2,Tue Jun 9 19:07:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be very fun. When you enter YV's mansion, you're always keeping an eye out for the missile guys who can oneshot you, and having to watch out for them in every single level would just be silly.  The other enemies wouldn't really add much, since most of them are similar to others (fish and turtles being basically rat reskins, other YV enemies being like bandits/crocs). The only ones I could see being an interesting addition are the Cursed Caves enemies."
NuclearThrone,39293c,Dirst,3,Tue Jun 9 01:20:42 2015 UTC,How dare you. Turtles aren't reskins of NUTHIN. THEY SPIN. :D :D :D

Just a thought."

NuclearThrone,390bk2,Usbdriver,7,Mon Jun 8 10:18:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe Throne Butt could cause the weapons to bounce back to you automatically, and the projectile blocking could just be a passive part of the active throw.

Fasten your seatbelts.  We've redesigned the way Chicken works.  After a lot of thought, we've decided that her slow-motion ability did more damage than it was worth, slowing down a game that's supposed to be fast. Her active also embarassingly emphasised a whole bunch of bugs. She can now throw weapons. This deals a whole load of damage, is able to one-hit kill a lot of enemies, but does leave you empty-handed for a bit. With that we've also got a new Throne Butt and two redesigned Ultras. As with all new things, this'll probably need a lot of tiny changes, exploit fixing, and balancing, but we're at least excited to get you started on this!  Then there's the crowns: We've done a lot of cleaning up, and decided to get rid of a few, combine some, and add a few new things. This'll hopefully result in a more interesting, less limiting selection! We're excited to see how things play out.  But there's way more... Portals now have a weaker pull in their ""outside region"" and after just appearing, allowing you to get out in a pinch; we've changed the way Golden Weapons unlock; we've done a ton of balancing; we've added cool new Wall Break sounds, and the list goes on! Details below, but we suggest you just jump in and give the much-changed and hopefully improved Nuclear Throne a run!  Features  -New Chicken. Go Hotline Miami on your enemies as you literally throw weapons at their faces!  -We've renamed, redesigned, and reconstructed a whole bunch of crowns!  -Gold weapons now become unlocked for your loadout when taken through a portal, including a cool sparkle sound effect!  -Portals don't pull as strong when you're further away for them and the first second after spawning.  Balancing  -IDPD now drop a lot more ammo and health. Wonder how that influences Rogue.  -Headless Chicken camera is less static.  -Gun Warrant now lasts a bit shorter, and has a visual effect.  -Golden Scorpions now have a max attack range.  -Horror drops even more rads when killed. Wonder when people get the hint that this might speed your run up.  -Snowbots and Wolves have less HP.  Fixes  -Rhino Freaks should no longer spawn inside walls.  -Death no longer resets your preferred starting weapon.  -Fixed an audio glitch when walls broke during the loading screen.  -Some of Y.V.'s tips now properly display the #!  -Fixed a ""drawing no weapon"" glitch.  -Lil' Hunters attack sounds should be more clear.  -Fixed the Lightning Hammer and Shovel icon.  -Picking up weapons should be slightly easier.  Misc  -The wall break sound is now different for most areas!  -Sounds for Gold Weapon related things!  -Added a few new tips.  -The Game Over map now shows B skins and special skins like headless Chicken and hooded Rebel.  -Rogue's Throne Butt now has a visual indication.  -Added a few more tiny interface animations to the Character Select screen.   We're super proud of this one. Hope you enjoy!"

NuclearThrone,390bk2,Hierophant750K,15,Mon Jun 8 09:31:41 2015 UTC,"Just did a chicken run to see the new active/butt/ultras. I may be missing something but chicken felt VERY weak. Active seemed to do about the same damage as a crossbow, thronebutt (deflect projectiles with active) is almost impossible to use effectively, and the B Ultra (active pierces) is sorta good but not nearly good enough.  Hate being a negative nancy so early, but these were my impressions."
NuclearThrone,390bk2,Fenixius,13,Mon Jun 8 09:47:36 2015 UTC,"It's less damage than a crossbow bolt for sure. Five crossbow bolts kill Big Bandit every time, so I put four in him then threw the bow itself. Bandit survived. Threw my other weapon, and THAT killed him."

Ultra B lets thrown weapons pierce.

Fish's roll is pretty evasive, so i pretty much reccomend you to try out every single mutant, since they all have their different play style. But as of again; Crystal is mainly for survival. So maybe try her out. Her shield is pretty great too! And Looping happens after you defeat a special boss and its final form. After defeating that form, you get sent back to 1-1 but now every kind of enemies start spawning. So after you loop, the game continues but with WAY MORE difficulty. I'm not going to spoil who is the final boss, and i hope nobody else will. It's kind of a surprise when you first time see it."
NuclearThrone,394i55,Akosss,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:16:00 2015 UTC,"Compared to Isaac, the game is more based on excellent reaction, aim and movement rather than lucky pickups. Watch high level players play if you want a good idea on basic movement (I like SleepCycles a lot), find characters and weapons that are comfortable for you and keep grinding it out.    Lil Hunter (the snow boss) will always be a pain in the ass, him you just gotta learn to deal with when the stage and him decide to destroy your world.    You'll understand what a loop is when you beat lots of stages, it's pretty clear once you get to that point. Or you could just cheat and google/look at the wiki. Watching high level players will spoil it too haha.    Seven hours isn't a lot of time spent in the game at all, most people burn through 50, 60, or even way more hours before they manage to beat the game and become consistent at every stage."

Get Plutonium Hunger, Second Stomach, Bloodlust, Rabbit's Paw, Rhino Skin - all survival mutations - and make use of Crystal's active when there are lots of projectiles.

NuclearThrone,394i55,LazliiX,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:14:16 2015 UTC,"I recommend playing with Steroids, because you start out very strong. You can fire both weapons without having to swap constantly, since right mouse button fires the secondary weapon with Steroids.   I like to pick an accurate, high damage weapon (laser/crossbow/slugger) for my primary and an area damage/utility weapon (grenade launcher, flame shotgun, etc) as my secondary. You can also use a melee weapon in the secondary which allows you to reflect shots and hit nearby enemies while still being able to fire your primary.  Basic tips:   Try to have something that will 1 shot rats in the sewers (or Scarier Face mutation which will make them die from only two bullets) If possible, try to have a grenade launcher for the scrapyard to destroy flame turrets. Get rid of it after that for a better weapon. When you are in the third snow level and expecting Lil' Hunter, your main priority should be making sure you have cover, because his most dangerous move is that wide triple bullet spray. Unload as hard as you can the instant he hits the ground, and then move behind cover immediately. He dies easily due to low health. Crystal area, something that one shots the spider crystals like crossbow or slugger is pretty useful For mutations you should prioritize choices that improve ammo and health like Back Muscle, Rabbit Paw, Scarier Face (less hp = easier to kill which saves ammo), Second Stomach, Rhino Skin, etc.  If you have a terrain destroying weapon you can use it to create cover, especially helpful on the Big Dog level when you spawn in Personal favorite weapons are the Seeker weapons, Lightning Pistol / Rifle, any of the Flame Shotguns, Auto Crossbow (and Heavy), and the Heavy Machinegun / Heavy Revolver.  Turn off screen shake, it makes it easier to play and dodge things Blow up any cars that an enemy or your own weapons might cause to explode at a bad time  Take it slow if you need to, there is no time limit"

Loop is when you beats Nuclear Throne face,and starts again from desert but with increased difficulty."

NuclearThrone,3944dy,Carradine,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:06:24 2015 UTC,"Try adding Plant, Steroids, and Horror to the list of characters to play. They all have powerful actives and good Throne Butt abilities. I started to find a lot of success with Nuclear Throne when I realized the goal is not to survive but to kill all the enemies. With that in mind, take mutations which help you kill or are at their best when killing. Also, having one or two solid defensive mutations is never a bad thing.  Bloodlust, boiling veins, impact wrists, plutonium hunger, rabbit paw, scarier face, second stomach, strong spirit, and trigger fingers.   You don't need any of the weapon specific mutations to loop. Not to say you shouldn't pick them but I wouldn't do so early. Yeah, laser pistol laser brain is a great start at 1-2 but then you have locked yourself in early. If you've got the skill to loop on command then it's very likely you'll get the laser weapon you want eventually but if you're just working on beating the thrown the ""all-purpose"" mutations are best. If it's 5-3, you found an auto-crossbow, and bolt marrow shows up, take it in that instance.  I'd like to point out extra feet and euphoria. These mutations get no love but are excellent. Aiming and movement are the core of Nuclear Throne. Everyone gets the point and shoot part but ignore evasion. You are never in danger if you don't get hit."

NuclearThrone,390z1e,LazliiX,2,Mon Jun 8 15:40:03 2015 UTC,"15; I hate to call you a liar, but Big Bandit takes 7 thrown weapon hits to kill him; you probably hit him with something else, or he took damage from something, without you noticing. Alternatively, you could have had Scary Face, which would bring his HP down to 80, still enough to take 5 thrown weapons, but not enough to take the 6th.  Here's further number proofs: It takes 1 hit to kill a scorpion. Scorpions have 15 HP. It takes more than 1 hit and a sword swing to take down a big maggot. Big maggots have 22 HP, and sword swing deals 6 damage. If the active dealt 16 damage, that would be enough with one swing to do 22 damage, but because that doesn't kill it, it can't deal 16 damage. The damage is >= 15, <16. There's only one number that fits that."

NuclearThrone,390z1e,jetio4,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:31:31 2015 UTC,"If you mean that you threw your disc gun, and you threw your sword 6 times, then no; BB still took 7 thrown weapon hits and died.  If you threw your disc gun and sword for a combination of 6 hits, then maybe, that'll have to have further testing. I don't believe that it'd be based on weapon, but I have no proof that it is not."

NuclearThrone,38zqdo,Snugglez150,5,Mon Jun 8 04:58:17 2015 UTC,"I play Rebel almost exclusively these days. A heavy ally version of Rebel where my goal is to simply survive and let them do most of the work. Always Ultra B. Weapon choices are geared toward killing shielders and creating some breathing room upon level entry. Multiple 3k+ kill runs under my belt. Stress is a good mutation with her but it can see limited effectiveness depending on your other mutations. My best runs come when I have second stomach, bloodlust, and Rhino skin. Makes it hard to have low health if playing aggressive. If I have stress with that loadout I see the biggest impact against bosses. Drop to 1-2 health and fire away. Or when I just don't get the health drops or bloodlust procs and I can't spawn any allies. I see stress as being mid-low tier as health comes back quickly enough to where the benefits of other mutations are on average, more impactful. If I had to rank relevant mutations.   Throne Butt / Plutonium Hunger Strong Spirit Bloodlust Second Stomach Scarier Face Rhino Skin / Boiling Veins   Then more niche/situational ones like Stress, Euphoria (makes it VERY hard to get hit behind a shield of allies), Impact Wrists, Trigger Fingers, and Sharp Teeth."
NuclearThrone,38zqdo,Carradine,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:38:53 2015 UTC,"I rarely go for Trigger Fingers or Stress (unless I'm playing YV), but then again I'm not very good at the game.  I really like Sharp Teeth on Rebel. Anything that messes with health is also really good, because it means more firepower overall. It also might mean slightly less ammo use for you, but that might be negligible.  Considering the regenerating health Rebel has, Strong Spirit might become a bit more useful.  A common strat I see for Rebel is to just spawn as many friends as possible as soon as you see an enemy, then just guide them around corners and into your enemies so they kill things and block damage for you."

Her passive is just fine. Making her passive like strong spirit honestly makes her easier to kill. When Chicken is headless, her body is immune to all damage, allowing her to go ham through bullet hell and swarms of enemies to get a medkit or a bloodlust proc through unrelenting bezerker slaughter. Your changes would make her vulnerable to being one-shot by damage that deals multiple hits like fire, explosions and assassins, which doesn't fit the theme of being hard to kill."
NuclearThrone,38z1zz,Otaku-sama,0,Mon Jun 8 01:48:33 2015 UTC,"The OLD strong spirit. When Strong Spirit was released it was op because it would only let you die at 1hp. You could get a car thrown in your face, if you picked up one medkit that got you back to 3hp, you'd be back on Strong Spirit again. That's what I'm suggesting for chicken, but with a cost: Her max hp whenever she enters on the headless state."
NuclearThrone,38z1zz,Otaku-sama,2,Mon Jun 8 01:55:55 2015 UTC,"Being able to die at 1 hp sounds a lot like how current Strong Spirit works without the need to recharge it. To be fair, I've never witnessed this old version of Strong Spirit, but from your description, damage sources with multiple hits would still kill you as the first tick would take you down to 1 hp, then the last tick will damage you past 1 hp. Perhaps the way certain damage types were handled was also different back then that made old Strong Spirit even stronger."

NuclearThrone,38y212,ZackaryC,9,Sun Jun 7 20:37:08 2015 UTC,"Eyes is the first character I beat the game with. (Working on Robot now.) Let me share some cool tricks:  -Eyes' Right Click ability may pull enemies closer, but it also slightly repels projectiles. This can be a godsend with enemies who rapidly fire bullets at you (especially bosses!)  -The ever-common Bandits and Ravens will NOT fire at you AT ALL from point-blank range. This behavior actually makes it safer for you to be closer to them, rather than farther away from them. Telekinesis is great for this. Just be careful, they might still fire at you if you're pulling them in but you're still far away enough.  -The biggest advice I can give here is that Eyes is a god when using a melee weapon. You can sidle against a wall, then Right Click to pull enemies on the other side closer to you. The wall will protect you, but you can still hold them in place for a bruising with the wrench/shovel/energy sword/whatever. Obviously, Long Arms is a mandatory upgrade.  -This last one is somewhat situational, but extremely fun and handy. The mutation combo of Euphoria + Throne Butt (stronger Telekinesis) nearly freezes projectiles in place! Be warned though, as enemies will be pulled to you at an uncomfortably fast rate.  -Telekinesis is the most dangerous to use in the Crystal Caves. No contest. Also be warned that it does slightly pull the Throne towards you.   -Sucking in weapons slowly is useful when you want to bring multiple weapons through the exit portal!"

NuclearThrone,38y212,TwentySharks,4,Sun Jun 7 21:44:10 2015 UTC,"Drawing enemies closer is good because it allows you to drag frustrating enemies out of hiding, like Snipers or Necromancers. It's also good if you have a melee weapon."
NuclearThrone,38y212,andrewladis,3,Sun Jun 7 21:03:37 2015 UTC,"He's very strategic, so he's not directly powerful.  He gets his power from survivability like sucking weapons and ammo/rads to him through corridors or during a fight.  His throne booty allows you to make your pulling power very strong and can be a blessing and a curse. Also he pushes projectiles away so hes personally my favorite throne fighter. His ultras are also amazing"

I think it would be cool if it was guaranteed that all drops be healthkits when below max health.  I don't think it would be broken, since you'd miss out on a lot of ammo.

Mine Launcher  Costs 1 bolt and 1 explosive  Calculate the distance between the player and their cursor, that will determine the speed of the projectile when fired. It will take 0.5 seconds to reach that spot, so do some math there. While in-flight, the projectile functions like a disc, dealing repeat damage to enemies but not disappearing and also bouncing off of walls it comes in contact with. When its 0.5 second flight timer expires, the mine lands on the ground and arms itself. From this point onward it will function as a hybrid of a grenade and an explosive barrel: it detonates if an enemy steps on it and it'll detonate if shot."

NuclearThrone,38u8oc,Cerulean_Turtle,2,Sun Jun 7 12:09:22 2015 UTC,i agree that you should basically spam a lot of the time. Ammo trouble shouldnt factor in too much until later in the game.
NuclearThrone,38u8oc,SherkPentagram,2,Mon Jun 8 03:07:00 2015 UTC,"Practice a lot, find weapons that suit how you like to play. Find a character that is the most fun (maybe wait a bit on Melting and Rogue) and grind it out with them until you feel confident or get bored and want to try someone new.    The Nuclear Throne Wiki is pretty useful to analyze raw stats and the basics of how enemies function, I learned a lot just from taking in that information myself. http://nuclear-throne.wikia.com/wiki/Nuclear_Throne_Wiki    Watching NorthernLion only made me want to play better than him, but watching SleepCycles is pretty damn entertaining and he is pretty consistently a great player, but like everyone in the game- has his own style of play that might not suit yours.  Bolt Marrow + Crossbow is a nice starter combo because it really helps your aim and kill power. I've liked melee weapons from the get go, but some people won't pick up anything that isn't Energy or Ultra for melee."

NuclearThrone,38opqa,LazliiX,3,Fri Jun 5 17:42:58 2015 UTC,"Now remember when I talked about the I.D.P.D. being the alternate versions of our characters, it is my belief that there are only 4 I.D.P.D. officers: Rogue, Inspector, Grunt and Shielder but by using this timeline breach that destroying the Throne has created they are able to travel into other timelines where the I.D.P.D. also exists and sends them back in time to ‘terminate’ our heroes and stop the timeline melt bringing us nicely onto our next section.  Part Four: Ambush The I.D.P.D. send back their officers to terminate our heroes but arrive just after you leave, hence showing you the slaughter fest in 0-1. They then ambush you hence that machine which tries to kill you and due to the infinite timelines they have infinite supplies and can try indefinitely until you die. And what’s the one rule of Nuclear Throne? You will always die. Therefore they succeed in their termination resetting the timeline back to zero before everything was destroyed, bringing you back to the campsite and allowing you to start the game again from zero.   FTFY"
NuclearThrone,38opqa,QTheNew42Q,3,Fri Jun 5 21:08:38 2015 UTC,"Are we really the heroes tho, the I.D.P.D. may just be trying to protect their own timeline from the chaos the destruction of the throne causes."

NuclearThrone,38opqa,Mecknavorz,3,Sat Jun 6 03:49:36 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of having a bunch of character-specific endings, like Mortal Kombat.   Fish destroys the throne and prepares to finally retire, but gets pulled into another dimension and recruited by the IDPD  Steroids destroys the throne and tries to rebuild it into something to undo the apocalypse. Also he founds a university or creates a scholarship or something  Melting destroys the throne and the burst of extreme radiation hideously mutates him back into a regular human being  YV destroys the throne but rebuilds it to exactly as it was, then just rides it around the wasteland as a mount properly befitting a true gun god  and some other stuff, I don't know"

NuclearThrone,38opqa,Funklord_Toejam,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:55:36 2015 UTC,"yeah pretty much copy-pasted.  except for the part about 4 IDPD soldiers only.. there are several times when multiple iterations of them come through the same portal.  So it seems pretty nonsensical to be like.. well they are from a different time jumping through when they come through the same portal.  wouldn't it make much more sense to have more than 4... and our mutants are just one of the trained IDPD soldiers that got mutated?  I also don't know about the characters trying to reach a non-apocalyptic timeline. The original name of the game ""Wasteland Kings"" would imply their motives are more selfish and are looking to become powerful and rule.  Also, the part about rogue seems tacked on and theres not much to support it. Its just as likely that rogue is on the run because she stole a portal device and weaponized it.  Maybe she learned of the nuclear throne and seeks power as well, not sure why all the characters hafta be so altruistic.  anyway decent write up anyway. thanks OP"

As frustrating as it is working for the Platinum God in Isaac, it's also super fulfilling!    They could do things like Dirst recommended, and maybe...    Choose every mutation at least once. Choose the Throne Butt mutation with all characters. Kill [x] enemies. (could be multiple tiers) Destroy [x] props. (could be multiple tiers) Beat the Throne with [character]. Beat the Throne with all characters. Kill every non-boss at least once. Find the Oasis/Pizza Sewers/Mansion/etc. Find the Proto Chest. Find the Super Disc Gun. (pls no tho) Beat Big Bandit/Big Dog/Lil Hunter/etc. Beat Ballmum/Hyper Crystal/Technomancer/etc. Beat the Throne after looping.    I'd hope for no achievements that require double loops.

NuclearThrone,38p776,flathz,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:34:40 2015 UTC,"A lot of it is just playing and learning on your own (which is a rare thing in games now a days), and lots of practice in general. However I do have some I can give you.  Boiling Veins is a great mutation, bullet weapons tend to fall off later unless you have Back Muscle or recycle gland. Sluggers are great weapons, and help so much with bosses since you can just pump slugs into them. Energy weapons are great, don't be afraid to pick them up, especially energy melees."
NuclearThrone,38p776,Emc73,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:46:01 2015 UTC,"I've kill the throne fairly frequently and have completed extra loops a few times and honestly, my best advice is if you just want to kill the throne, play as crystal. She makes all of the boss fights piss easy! In fact she makes nearly everything piss easy, just kill all the melee enemies first and you have nothing to fear. That, and she gets extra health!  After the throne she's not all that useful, but she's great for new players imo."

NuclearThrone,38nzmq,LazliiX,3,Fri Jun 5 20:27:05 2015 UTC,There's a little bit of time between the fire direction change
NuclearThrone,38nzmq,A_BEAUTIFUL_PONY,2,Fri Jun 5 20:52:26 2015 UTC,"When firing horizontally, both of those fire traps cover the non-firing faces of the other trap. If you were out of the range of the covering trap, you probably don't have the time to make it past the vertical shot between startup and the dissipation of the last fire particle (they last for a frame or two after the graphic is practically gone), and after waiting for the last vertical particle to dissipate you might not have time to get out of horizontal range, as that's part of the change time.  And don't say that they're pretty far away from each other in the picture, because I've personally had traps that were closer. Sometimes you absolutely cannot avoid damage without Boiling Veins."

NuclearThrone,38nzmq,nicolasrededeo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:14:27 2015 UTC,"I agree, sometimes you have to have Boiling Veins. But in this case, i think you don't. Assuming you're going from right to left, you can go through the first gap when they stop firing horizontally. Then you wait at the second gap for them to stop firing vertically. The fire doesn't instantly go away after they stop firing vertically, but considering they're pretty far away from each other, i think you could still outrun the horozontal fire."

Just a helpful tip. You can go into the side walls and loop around the throne and fight it back up the pathway for extra time. Alternatively you can fight it from within the side walls.

Gender being more or less a societal construct, lacking gender may just mean that the society in which people are pressured to have genders has fallen away. Since Steroids is human, though it's definitely possible they're intersex, they may still have a wang, regardless of gender."
NuclearThrone,38im1t,greatzimkogway,4,Thu Jun 4 20:15:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I think I used the wrong term. I meant sex-less (?) But I don't think Rami ever meant to be that specific.  Regardless, Rami said that no-one knows if steroids is male or female, essentially.  Also, is Steroids any more human than fish or melting? He might most closely resemble a human's body, but probably only superficially.   Melting is essentially just a mutilated corpse with psychic powers. I'd say he's the closest to human there is."

NuclearThrone,38k3oe,TheInsaneWombat,12,Thu Jun 4 19:11:56 2015 UTC,Melting + Horror so that you get to level up super quick and choose your build. Flat improvement over Melting
NuclearThrone,38k3oe,Roran01,2,Thu Jun 4 19:13:14 2015 UTC,"Melting's passive is ""Less HP, more XP"" though, so the hybrid character would also have 2HP..."
NuclearThrone,38k3oe,Dirst,2,Thu Jun 4 20:54:18 2015 UTC,"It would still be a flat improvement, as you could get the mutations you want faster and more reliably, as opposed to just faster or just more reliably."
NuclearThrone,38k3oe,Roran01,4,Thu Jun 4 20:56:09 2015 UTC,"That's kind of obvious. Adding any bonus to any character is an improvement. In fact, Melting, Rogue, and Steroids are the only passives you can add to another character that can have a negative effect (low HP, constant IDPD, and lower accuracy)."
NuclearThrone,38k3oe,Dirst,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:07:48 2015 UTC,"Sure, but in this case it helps fix a MAJOR problem with Melting, that if you can't get the HP mutations, you're screwed. IMHO no other passives combined would have any greater effect on a class. +2 HP from Crystal is nice but a tad unneccesary. More ammo from Fish is good but can be compensated for via mutations and ammo-efficient weapons. Eyes' passive is junk. Personally I've never noticed Plant's passive movement. Increased ROF from YV is also cool but again can be easily compensated for. Starting with extra ammo from Steroids is again cool but isn't too big. Weapons a floor earlier is a tad too situational for me, as I've noticed little difference. Chicken and Rebel have the other two passives that would have a big impact, but seeing as Chicken's makes you lose health max and Rebel's heals rounded down, I feel that they are temporary survivability that'll just mask flaws a build has. Rouge's passive has little use and seems quite detrimental to me."

NuclearThrone,38k3oe,catsinbox,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:35:36 2015 UTC,"For reference, passives: Fish: More ammo from packs Eyes: See in the dark Melting: More rads (less health) Plant: Faster Steroids: Full-auto weapons (less accuracy) Rebel: Heal for half of lost health at portal Crystal: More HP Y.V.: Higher fire rate Horror: Extra mutation choice Rogue: Blast armour Robot: Better weapons earlier  So all this being the case, I'm not sure why exactly we're combining passives, but I'd probably go for Y.V.'s fire rate and Steroids' auto, or Crystal's HP and Rogue's Blast Armour for a sort of gamma guts/sharp teeth utilising build.  If we mixed passives and actives I could see a few interesting synergies - Blast Armour and Rebel's active would add to the damage-taking thing Rebel has going on, Eyes would certainly benefit from Blast Armour for the times when you accidentally pull in a rat, and auto Pop Pop would be great with Trigger Fingers."

NuclearThrone,38jl76,Dirst,4,Thu Jun 4 22:55:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's because currently, part of Steroids' passive is to ""start with a second revolver"", not to ""start with two weapons""."
NuclearThrone,38jl76,Mate9,-1,Thu Jun 4 23:31:27 2015 UTC,"It says dual weilding, and that does not limitates to double-revolver. It's clearly a bug.   The ""second"" revolver on the character selection screen is merely cosmetic. You can tell this because even tho the first revolver should represent the M1 and the seccond should represent the M2, in actuallity they dont. You can't ""click"" the second revolver. You can't pick a golden weapon as your secondary.   If you click on the M2 revolver and pick a golden crossy, in my case, when it comes back to the normal screen, you'll see that the crossy is on the M1 instead of M2. Whether or not you consider this a big or a small bug, it's up to you and probably directly related to how much you play steroids. Steroids is one of my main boiz.   I hope that like other small bugs (Crows don't dying because they're caught on both cars and B.Dog's explosion when they're next to a wall, or the fact that you cant hit some enemies when they're next to walls with the crossbow and the auto crossbow, even if you have bolt narrow and etc), this will eventually come to the dev's eyes and they'll fix it. For now, Golden Crossy + Golden Laser Pistol on 1_1 is nothing but a dream."
NuclearThrone,38jl76,Breakbeat_Junkie,2,Fri Jun 5 01:30:27 2015 UTC,"Steroids' second revolver is hardcoded into the game so it cant be edited that easily, and it probably will never be. Also for the double golden weps, it is not a bug either."
NuclearThrone,38jl76,Arc_Nexus,2,Fri Jun 5 04:32:47 2015 UTC,Well. It being hardcoded explains a lot. Explains the fact that even through editing the savefiles you can't change the second revolver.

NuclearThrone,38gy21,Cerulean_Turtle,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:48:42 2015 UTC,"It's primarily a comfort thing. My wrist is more likely to hurt sooner if I'm using WASD. I use a kb/m for starcraft or games where it's just almost entirely the mouse (Democracy, Civ, Diablo etc).  When I'm traveling I only have a mac laptop so I use a kb/m then, since gamemaker doesn't support tattieboggle anymore (still bullshit). And I do okay, but it's less satisfying for me to play. I also used a kb/m to play Exanima since the cursor control was so important. I think that game could be made to play on a controller quite easily, actually, but it wasn't natively supported.  I just find dual axis controls incredibly comfortable. I have a lot of hours playing with them, and use the setup for any game that supports it. It feels similar to control geometry wars, binding of isaac, luftrausers, nuclear throne, platformers, etc. And so I just got used to it. I'll use a controller to play single player fps games, too, or for things like halo that support it. And it's actually part of what prevents me from picking up CS:GO... which is sort of unfortunate.  I've been looking more at trackballs recently and I've always had a slight desire to try and make a controller. Something with thumbsticks and buttons and a trackball could maybe feel really good. Makes me excited for the steam controller, but I'll definitely have to test it out."

NuclearThrone,38h2sj,piemonke,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:38:21 2015 UTC,"First of all, golden weapons don't drop before L1 1-1 or earlier apart from YV's. Increases of difficulties from visiting crown vaults or the turtle sewers or cursed chests or even playing as robot can push this back but you would need 4 levels of difficulty to make this possible. Even with 4 levels back it would need to be from a chest and not just on the ground and there is no chest in sight.  Secondly  if you look at the level plot you can see he visited the turtle sewers (which is possible without an explosive weapon but rare). From there you need a screwdriver to access the mansion.   If you don't understand the plotting or disagree, let me know and I will explain why this is further."
NuclearThrone,38h2sj,EC-10,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:41:54 2015 UTC,"Of course, they could've picked up a grenade launcher in the sewers and only used it to open the turtle sewers, and replaced it with a screwdriver which they only used to get to Y.

NuclearThrone,38g5lf,24gz,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:31:25 2015 UTC,"Bolt and heavy bolt projectiles put enemies into hitstun. But the caveat is that bolts and heavy bolts are coded to explicitly ignore the rest of the damage-dealing script if the enemy is already in the hitstun animation.  This isn't a problem with shells, slugs, splinters, seekers, bullets, and explosives because they disappear on-hit, so there's no issue. But bolts and melee go through multiple enemies, which is why whenever you have 2 projectiles of those types, they'll only deal the damage once.   The code associated with fixing it is a headache if you don't know some tricks to work around it, but it's just not a high priority right now."

Sure, a good many of my runs end in the Desert now, but those that make it to the Scrapyard actually have a very good chance to make it to the Throne! A shotgun or crossbow early on is key, though bad weapons aren't a death stroke. Being really proficient with your main helps as well; both of the runs I won would have gone much worse had I not been playing Plant. If Robot is your main, it may be better just to go the regular route, seeing as skipping those areas counts as skipping a lot more chances to eat weaponry. Up to you, though."

NuclearThrone,38h20a,atrain99,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:00:49 2015 UTC,"I only found out the other day myself, basically you need to find a screwdriver before the scrapyard and keep hold of it. once you get to 3-1 take your screwdriver and hit it against the car with golden trim that will spawn somewhere on the level, press E to get in the car and youll be taken to the mansion. Not 100% sure on everything that can drop in there but golden laser pistol and golden grenade launcher especially are pretty great to start with. Btw take open mind and there might be 2 golden chests, but remember that you can only have 1 golden weapon saved so just take the one you want and make sure youre holding it when you die."

Just a thought.  As for the IDPD dropping weapons, it'd be a nice addition, although it would lower the incentive for playing Rogue(Was there any?), since She's the only way to have an IDPD weapon."
NuclearThrone,38czmp,Treldent02,6,Wed Jun 3 14:42:32 2015 UTC,"Pretty much yeah, every IDPD themed weapon should fire blue bullets. I actually forgot the Smart gun, will add it to the main topic.  And the Hyper Launcher should make the IDPD explosions too, now that I think about it.  And well, about Rogue (I love her btw, I just suck way too much to be able to play her efficiently), she could keep her unique 2 shot burst weapon (which is awesome) and the IDPD weapons would be different from that specific one.   They would be ""generic"" IDPD weapons, and would somewhat be similar to the one we already have but with some little variations so they would be more reliable to use but pack a little less punch.  For example, the IDPD assault rifle could fire 4 shot with a lower firerate than the regular one, but the accuracy on it would be so good than when paired with eagle eye, it wouldn't have any kind of dispersion at all. (I am actually not so sure if that's already the case on the regular assault rifle, feel free to correct me there.)"

NuclearThrone,38bxq9,Batteryhorse,6,Wed Jun 3 05:51:24 2015 UTC,"The first one sounds awesome, but it would probably take a lot of time to code with the amount of weapons that are currently in the game.   I don't see a problem with the second one though."
NuclearThrone,38bxq9,WUMBOSHMUMBO,0,Wed Jun 3 17:54:40 2015 UTC,"Well it would apply to everything, so you could just apply it to the character instead of every gun."
NuclearThrone,38bxq9,420LaysIt,2,Wed Jun 3 23:37:58 2015 UTC,There are a bunch of different projectiles you would have to code to use the new mutations.

NuclearThrone,38bxq9,420LaysIt,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:01:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, but are there not already effects that apply to every weapon? Like YV's +20% fire rate, for instance."
NuclearThrone,38bxq9,420LaysIt,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:52:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that effects fire rate, which is actually a weapon attribute, not YV. The YV code just tells the weapons to decrease their fire rate by that much.   Weapon mutations apply to projectile objects, not weapons or characters."
NuclearThrone,38bxq9,the8cell,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:57:54 2015 UTC,"Yes I know, but what I'm saying is if they can apply fire rate to all weapons, wouldn't it be not that difficult to apply it to player projectiles?"
NuclearThrone,38bxq9,SMJ2893,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:18:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, sure. Not too bad at all.  The tough part is balancing.  Do we really want dual bouncing, homing Gatling Bazookas?  And even limited versions of each mutation could turn a crossbow into an insane death machine."
NuclearThrone,38bxq9,the8cell,3,Thu Jun 4 23:27:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, steroids doesn't need amazing ultra mutations In my opinion. Having double the base DPS and a throne butt that could arguably be called the best mutation in the game (since it gives free ammo without filling your unused pools and therefore lowering the chances of health drops)  That said, I don't particularly like either of his ultra mutations.  I think he would be better off with an ultra that does the same thing as back muscle (making steroids able to carry around triple the base amount if he takes back muscle as well) and a mutation that makes it so if both your weapons are based on the same ammo pool there is a 30% they will consume one less ammo- 50 percent if firing both."
NuclearThrone,38bxq9,SMJ2893,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:24:19 2015 UTC,"Combine that second one with recycle gland and you have a winner. I thought the double think idea was great, and the 300% ammo increase sounds understandable for Steriods given his bulk.  How about an ultra mutation for a third weapon (also wielded) that you have to press B to shoot. He'd grow a third arm to hold it with, and you'd need a third hand to fire it!"
NuclearThrone,38bxq9,LazliiX,2,Thu Jun 4 11:23:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting as that would be, it would require way too big a rework of the way the game is programmed  I like my idea because (beyond the fact that it's my idea and I'm biased) it is similar to the current ultras in being geared towards two of the same weapon or two different weapons, but much more useful.  I think the first one might be harder to implement because it would roll all the ammo counts into triple digits, but whatever.  Steroids is unique among characters with the ability to sustainably use two weapons that share an ammo pool thanks to his throne butt. the mutation only taking ONE ammo off would encourage the more dakka type weapons like miniguns that suit steroids's character cliche rather than ones with multiple ammo drained per shot  On the off chance anyone from vlambeer is reading this, consider this replacement idea for ambidextrous yours to use."

NuclearThrone,38c4io,wow75,12,Wed Jun 3 07:02:46 2015 UTC,"I think the daily runs should disable the saved weapon in the proto chest, but if the game currently allows it- it would have been pretty easy to have left the gun there, it isn't that rare of a gun.    I don't like that you can bring a crown into the daily either, but that seems to be the devs choice, and there is the slight balance of IDPD being on your tail from time to time, plus crowns all having downsides."
NuclearThrone,38c4io,SwordSaint892,2,Wed Jun 3 07:56:34 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize you could bring a crown into daily until last night... I've been practicing with crown of blood, and assumed that it would blank it when I ran a daily like it blanks your golden weapon....  Nope!"
NuclearThrone,38c4io,captain_frisk,-5,Wed Jun 3 14:34:33 2015 UTC,it isn't that rare of a gun.    54 gameplay hours. Never seen one. Agree that proto chest shouldn't exist.
NuclearThrone,38c4io,Fenixius,3,Wed Jun 3 09:21:45 2015 UTC,Ho wfar do your runs usually get?
NuclearThrone,38c4io,Helicuor,2,Thu Jun 4 02:53:21 2015 UTC,"Save-editing a SPC into the Proto-Chest would be cheating in my book. If you want a godly weapon with low-drop, you should at least grind out the SPC... but just because he usually has one in the Proto-Chest, I wouldn't just assume he save edited it. I find one once every few days. Just found one yesterday and triple looped with it.  On a similar note, I think Proto-Chest items, starting with Crown of Blood, and 0% Screenshake is try-harding, so I refuse to do so. Yes it's the daily, but I like to see how I do without cheesing, and play the game like the majority of other players. It's just how I like to play."
NuclearThrone,38c4io,IshThe2nd,2,Thu Jun 4 18:33:41 2015 UTC,You can put weapons into the proto chest and they'l be there next run
NuclearThrone,38c4io,mantrica,2,Wed Jun 3 07:18:45 2015 UTC,"Right. What's conflicting me is that I'm pretty sure he didn't do that, he modified the game so it was in there without any effort."
NuclearThrone,38c4io,Krognol,3,Wed Jun 3 07:45:02 2015 UTC,I highly doubt that considering the SPC shows up very often randomly.
NuclearThrone,38c4io,Dirst,0,Wed Jun 3 11:23:21 2015 UTC,"He almost probably save edited it, since that's what he did before. The question here is if that should be allowed, and I think probably yes. But Proto Chest should probably be removed for Dailies, or the game could have a build-in function to edit the item in it before a run to it becomes more of a ""guaranteed weapon for this run"" instead of ""Hey you forgot to replace it by grinding 20 runs, have a rusty revolver""."
NuclearThrone,38c4io,Krognol,2,Wed Jun 3 13:31:38 2015 UTC,"But we can't prove he save edited it in there. So why throw false claims around without proof?  Also, I don't see a reason to remove the proto chests. You don't have to grind 20 runs the get the weapon you want in there, it rewards paying attention and it adds en extra layer of strategy."
NuclearThrone,38c4io,Dirst,-1,Wed Jun 3 13:48:50 2015 UTC,"First off, whether or not he did isn't really the point of this thread anyway.  And second, you have to grind up to infinite runs to get the weapon you want in there, since it's completely RNG what weapons you find in a run. I've played for 146 hours and found only one Double Minigun and two SPCs in all my time playing, and I loop on most runs. It's just tedious and I don't think it adds much to the game in its current form."
NuclearThrone,38c4io,SwordSaint892,2,Wed Jun 3 14:07:14 2015 UTC,"I have like 110 hours, loop maybe once or twice a day. I see the Super Plasma Cannon two or three times a week. I don't like how stutter-y the game gets when you use it so I rarely even use it haha. I'd trade you my RNG for yours if I could."
NuclearThrone,38c4io,Krognol,0,Wed Jun 3 19:20:42 2015 UTC,If you loop on most runs you will most likely see close to all weapons in the game which doesn't make it hard to put a single gun in your chest. Especially if you don't open your weapons chests immediately and wait for super chests.   It's just tedious and I don't think it adds much to the game in its current form.   So don't use it. I don't see why Vlambeer should limit the options you have to get a specific gun in the game because a handful of people don't like the proto chest.
NuclearThrone,38c4io,ledraps,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:38:06 2015 UTC,"It's not cheating, anyone can do it with a run beforehand, so as long as it's acceptable without save editing it should be acceptable with it.  Now, I'd like there to be no proto chest on dailies in the first place. But as long as it works without save editing it's acceptable. Just because someone got an ultra shovel on their practice run and stashed it into the crown vault, it doesnt mean they have justification over someone who save edits it in."

NuclearThrone,387ept,Battle_Bee,13,Tue Jun 2 11:37:35 2015 UTC,"If flame weapons are meant for aggression and damage, then cryo weapons should be for defense!  Projectiles shot from cryo guns have a chance to freeze solid as they travel, creating stationary, artificial Ice Barriers.  Ice Barriers have 5 HP, and are for defensive use. They block all enemies and their projectiles until they are destroyed, but they can be destroyed by the player as well!  The first 3 cryo weapons deal slightly less damage compared their normal counterparts, and have a limited range. (The projectile disappears if it freezes)  Ice cannons work a bit differently, however. The Ice Cannon fires solidified ice, which explodes when it impacts something. The explosion creates 2-4 Ice Barriers, and also has a chance to freeze all non-boss enemies caught in the ""snowsplosion"". Frozen enemies can still shoot, but they can't move. The effect wears off after a short while.  The Super Ice Cannon fires a gigantic ice glob, which creates 7-10 Ice Barriers and freezes enemies. The blast radius is huge, 33% bigger than the Nuke Launcher.  It also spawns 5 normal Ice Cannon projectiles, because Nuclear Throne loves its splitting projectiles!  -Cryo Rifle fires bursts of 3, consumes 3 bullets.  -Cryo Pistol consumes 1 bullet.  -Cryo Shotgun consumes 1 shell.  -Ice Cannon consumes 1 explosive.  -Super Ice Cannon consumes 4 explosives.  The Ice Cannon deals damage comparable to the Grenade Launcher (15), and the Super Ice Cannon is comparable to the Nuke Launcher (50). Their projectiles will also never freeze in mid-air, and they are the only thing that deals damage. The snowsplosions do not hurt enemies."
NuclearThrone,387ept,Pooseiden,9,Tue Jun 2 11:37:50 2015 UTC,Having a chance to freeze as the projectiles travel doesn't seem controlled enough. Maybe have killed enemies freeze into ice blocks?

NuclearThrone,38b0hy,Krognol,2,Wed Jun 3 02:36:55 2015 UTC,Throne has 1800 1600 hp with scarier face. Bullets do 3 dmg.  3 x 212 = 636  Lightning rifle does 7-14 dmg per shot. So say aprox. 10 dmg per shot.  10 x 86 = 860  636 + 860 = 1496  You were off by 304 about 104 dmg. But like /u/Mae__ said; lightning weapons aren't great for the throne fight.
NuclearThrone,38b0hy,Battle_Bee,2,Wed Jun 3 11:40:26 2015 UTC,"Throne with Scarier Face has 1600 HP, not 1800.  Just correcting a minor mistake."

NuclearThrone,386obc,TheHattGuy,12,Tue Jun 2 06:08:31 2015 UTC,I actually really like this idea. I think just making it do more damage at range is enough. Like a reverse shotgun.
NuclearThrone,386obc,TheSilverSpiral,7,Tue Jun 2 06:28:58 2015 UTC,"Or, we could make it the rifle that a Sniper uses. Sights, and three shotgun pellets. Sounds bad? Probably."
NuclearThrone,386obc,Dancing_Anatolia,2,Tue Jun 2 06:37:15 2015 UTC,"Make it an early game weapon, then. As in, 1_1 early."
NuclearThrone,386obc,TheGullibleParrot,7,Tue Jun 2 14:20:19 2015 UTC,"When using the sniper rifle, the player can scroll by hovering the curser over the edge of the screen, to acquire targets that are a little too far away.   This isn't necessary! The camera already moves with the cursor, at varying degrees based on your weapon (switch from crossbow to shotgun and see the camera move closer). If they do this the same way that I've done it in my games (which they probably do since it's pretty much one or two super simple lines of code), they could just increase the ""weight"" of the sniper rifle so that the cursor can pull the camera out beyond the usual limits. You can get this to function really well and it ""feels"" intuitive to control it this way, rather than pushing against the edges of the screen.  As another plus, it'd make it damn hard to aim at close range, which fits how you want a sniper type weapon to be used in-game."
NuclearThrone,386obc,buster2Xk,6,Tue Jun 2 11:04:11 2015 UTC,"The damage scaling with the distance would be interesting but it wouldn't work for certain levels like the sewers or labs?

NuclearThrone,386obc,Speechbonus,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:29:17 2015 UTC,"Plenty of weapons are less useful on certain stages (especially pre-loop), the sniper being less useful on closed up areas would make sense. And if you stand way back from the Throne, it'd probably start charging you down to crush you so you can't just lean on that."
NuclearThrone,386obc,SwordSaint892,8,Tue Jun 2 19:36:41 2015 UTC,"I know you mentioned the crossbow, but come on, aesthetic doesn't really matter. The crossbow is basically a sniper rifle. Also, scroll wheel is reserved for changing weapons. The ability to see further is also one of Plant's abilities and Eagle Eyes. So it wouldn't make sense to null out those 2 things."
NuclearThrone,386obc,Nommiin,2,Tue Jun 2 06:21:42 2015 UTC,I think they changed Eagle Eyes a few patches ago so it doesn't increase view distance anymore.

NuclearThrone,3892uu,ThePigWarrior,0,Tue Jun 2 18:54:48 2015 UTC,"That's actually due to the way the game handles sounds! You see, for whatever reason, the Game Maker engine can only handle two sounds at any given time (or at least the NT version can), one of which is the music, the other of which is whatever's happening in the world. Since the game can't play two sounds at the same time, when you kill lots of things at once (i.e. a Maggot Mamma with a Melee weapon) the game has to play each death sound one after another so they don't overlap. I think it gives a great sense of power to that final swing."

It takes away the tense fast-paced chaotic fights, with Throne Butt and the Ultra for it especially.  I frequently do Chicken Sword only runs because it's very fun and challenging, and I always have to refrain from getting throne butt because it makes the game slow and boring, plus takes a lot of the mechanical and reactional skill out of it.

Running out of ammo with only a few weak enemies left has always been the most annoying way to end a run, and this should prevent that.  Also, can't wait to do ""thrown weapon only"" challenge runs.  Also, being able to throw weapons means you may be able to collect the weapons after a level ends to throw them into the portal to take with you, something only Eyes can do currently. Would be very useful on a lot of characters, particularly Robot so he can save a bunch of weapons as emergency rations."

NuclearThrone,382rd1,8988303682,2,Mon Jun 1 16:11:30 2015 UTC,"So is boiling veins + crown of hatred + stress. Perfect combo achieved, just throw on strong spirit. You're now leveling up much faster, invulnerable to explosions, can survive a bullet, and shoot 40% faster constantly."
NuclearThrone,382rd1,yyyfa,11,Tue Jun 2 13:33:36 2015 UTC,"Strong Spirit isn't actually that good by itself, but it's good when combined with other health mutations like the ones you've named."
NuclearThrone,382rd1,TwentySharks,7,Mon Jun 1 14:29:26 2015 UTC,"I used to not really understand it until I thought of it like the sturdy trait in pokémon. Sturdy is typically used on fragile lead pokemon so they get the opportunity to get something like stealth rocks or a light screen/reflect up. It's essentially a 'last stand' mechanic to use on something you know is going to die, but you really need it to do something beforehand. Transferring that into Nuclear Throne, I tend To think of Strong Spirit as an 'anti-huge-fuckup' measure. Something like an explosion which would normally kill you won't if you have strong spirit up. This allows you to take more risks in your gameplay, since you know you won't die if accidentally shot a car next to you while you're trying to get a sweet shot off on a robo-sniper. It allows you to do something to further your progression or survival that would normally cause you to die (sound familiar?). Of course, it also has the effect of giving you a buffer of security between life and death just like sturdy. On your point of mob deaths being more common that single instances of large damage, I would agree with you, and I think lengthening the iframes after taking damage a bit would improve Strong Spirit as an item and also stop the player from feeling like they died before they could react, which would seem like an instance of artifical difficulty to them, even if it really isn't, and lead to rage."
NuclearThrone,382rd1,Cappop,2,Mon Jun 1 16:12:07 2015 UTC,Like melee or shotgunning a sniper like an idiot.
NuclearThrone,382rd1,Kanoa,2,Mon Jun 1 20:29:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I don't know why I think I can do it without strong spirit, It always ends in explosions and sadness."
NuclearThrone,382rd1,Cappop,5,Mon Jun 1 20:41:08 2015 UTC,"Y'know, I used to share that attitude. I used to HATE Strong Spirit, and would take Bolt Marrow without a Bolt weapon over it. I saw it as a mutation where you survive damage from one hit, but just immediately get hit by something else and so what's the point?  However, one fateful Fish run I was forced to take it over 3 terrible mutations, and so I begrudgingly accepted. That run, I managed to loop. Multiple times I almost died but was saved by Strong Spirit, and due to having Rabbit Paw, Second Stomach and Plutonium Hunger it was amazingly easy to recharge. After that run I thought, hey, I suppose I should rank this a bit higher, so I chose it more often, and rated it higher, and chose it even more often..  And then I really got to thinking.   Look at it this way, a bullet does 3 damage. It take 3 bullets to kill you from 8 health. With Strong Spirit, it takes 4. With Rhino Skin, it also takes 4. I realised that they both serve pretty much the same purpose, in different ways. They save you from 1, maybe 2 extra hits, and synergise really well with Second Stomach.   Perhaps see it as this, getting back up to full health with Rhino Skin is just like recharging Strong Spirit. Very rarely there are situations when one is better than the other, but they both have advantages and disadvantages. I now actually prefer Strong Spirit to Rhino Skin as I find it easier to get back to full health.  I suppose the main message of this is: Give it a try."

NuclearThrone,382rd1,burningsensation,5,Wed Jun 3 21:57:39 2015 UTC,"Protects you from OHKOs such as contact damage from the Throne and Crystals, which is something Rhino Skin can't do."
NuclearThrone,382rd1,WhatSecretProject,2,Mon Jun 1 21:35:13 2015 UTC,"If I die, its from something that would often kill me instantly, not something that whittles me down, so Strong Spirit helps a lot with that."
NuclearThrone,382rd1,Bodacious27,2,Mon Jun 1 19:40:46 2015 UTC,Strong Spirit typically blows Rhino Skin out of the water.  For a more controversial opinion: anyone who takes Skin over Spirit as Rebel should crunch the numbers.

NuclearThrone,382rd1,SMJ2893,1 point,Tue Jun 2 11:21:18 2015 UTC,I'd take Bolt Marrow or Trigger Fingers or Open Mind over Rhino Skin if I have Strong Spirit already tbh
NuclearThrone,382rd1,LazliiX,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:52:19 2015 UTC,"I like strong spirit because it allows me to screw up with my typically poor dodging skills and still survive. While it's obviously better if you have bloodlust and/or second stomach and/or rabbit paw (and sort of worse with rhino skin since you have more health to recover), it still lets you take any hit and live, so you can survive assassins, unlucky shots, rats or spiders, getting pinned by crystals, etc, etc. Basically it's one free pass to screw up and then get the hell out of there. Also it makes you nigh on invincible as Melting."
NuclearThrone,382rd1,DoubleAlces,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:30:30 2015 UTC,"While I can't argue against your other points (although I don't particularly agree with them) I have to say that all the complaints about Strong Spirit's recharge time are some of the stupidest complaints I've ever heard.  Yeah, it takes time to recharge. But guess what? If it weren't there, you'd just be dead. It's better to have a fighting chance on a run that ends shortly after then to die on a run that could have turned into something amazing."
NuclearThrone,382rd1,Kingmal,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:29:24 2015 UTC,"It keeps a run alive when it would normally fail. Not all individuals suffer from taking loads of damage in quick succession as you do (on regular occasion), it depends on what enemies they are strong at avoiding or killing.  It synergizes well with other perks like second stomach.  It's good to take if you do not have access to second stomach or rhino skin so that you still have that extra survivability.  It's good on melting."
NuclearThrone,382rd1,oposdeo,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:44:45 2015 UTC,"I typically consider it weaker than most people do, but with certain builds Strong Spirit is very useful. Melting and low-HP Chicken can start to take advantage of it often, especially if they have Rabbit Paw or Bloodlust.    In general I find Rhino Skin, Rabbit Paw+Second Stomach, or Bloodlust+Crown of Blood to be more useful. Though I like Strong Spirit more than Boiling Veins 90+% of the time.    It does have it's uses for when you suddenly take one burst of crazy damage, but yeah it becomes useless if you get hit with multiple things at once since everything hurts a lot in this game."

Steroids- Steroids used to be a scientist, so let's see him in a lab coat and glasses.  Robot- Rusted Robot anyone?  Chicken- I wanna see Chicken as a full out ninja. Maybe looking like an assassin?

NuclearThrone,37wrge,moonra_zk,1 point,Sun May 31 11:56:06 2015 UTC,This is true. But going to the level purely because it exists and is an extra level therefore giving extra difficulty hardly feels worth it to me.   I guess the better example would have been Y.V.'s mansion since it doesn't give any extra difficulty and golden weapons are pretty bad.

NuclearThrone,37wrge,Dirst,1 point,Sun May 31 11:57:15 2015 UTC,"There's an issue with the Riot Shotgun, I think. Most weapons are balanced by having increased total DPS but higher ammo cost, lower accuracy, etc. For example SMG fires way faster than Machinegun but far less accurate, Sawed off Shotgun more pellets than double shotty for the same cost, but less accurate.  Riot Shotgun firing 3 more pellets doesn't warrant using 2 ammo per shot, but it would have to have less accuracy to make up for that upside plus the higher RoF."

You take weapon specific mutations if they're your only options, you've taken most of your utility mutations, or you just really wanna stick to one weapon/weapon type."

NuclearThrone,37ymuw,Thebestofbothsites,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:28:18 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, some perks are core depending on your mutant. Melting NEEDS Rhino Skin, of course. Another example is on Robot, you definitely want to pick up Second Stomach when you can, so you turn weapons from medkits to ""Savior Kits"" or so I call them. I suggest you always put a focus on utility while aiming for good lategame perks when you can, because you never know when you'll want to swap out a weapon for something better. Wouldn't want to waste a perk slot on a weapon type unless you're 100% committed to it, right? That's why getting used to many different weapons is something that'll help you out in the long run. Give everything a try, and don't be afraid to get out of that comfort zone. Personally, if I can get a crossbow, just a regular old crossbow with Bolt Marrow, I feel like I'm ready for anything. Examples of lategame perks are Scarier Face (which is a mandatory perk imo) and it's never a bad idea to grab Back Muscle when you've got some good weapons. Especially since the Throne eats ammo like crazy. All in all it's just something you'll have to develop over time. You'll eventually get that game sense you need and be able to efficiently plan things out based on whatever perks and weapons you get early on. Most of the time it's just preference, but lately I've been thinking twice about my selection of mutations, and it's helped me out a lot. Being used to most of the mutations also helps, never judge a book by it's cover. Fell in love with Bolt Marrow when I decided to give it a chance."

NuclearThrone,37v31d,KoboldCommando,4,Sat May 30 17:31:28 2015 UTC,Enemies sometimes spawn in groups during loops. Getting to 1-1 is considered a loop. Also Open Mind has nothing to do with group spawns....
NuclearThrone,37v31d,Tyrant_Kitten,8,Sat May 30 20:03:04 2015 UTC,"I think the idea is that it's reasonable to expect that open mind could spawn additional radiation containers, and if it's big enough for horror to spawn, maybe there could be multiple horrors."
NuclearThrone,37v31d,Glaciace,1 point,Sat May 30 20:14:54 2015 UTC,"Technically OP was on 0-1, and I personally don't like it how that's considered a loop even before the Throne dies. As with what KoboldCommando said, the reason why I mentioned Open Mind is that there's always a chance you could miss extra radiation canisters spawned by the mutation. Which could have been the reason why Hostile Horror was triggered.  Now if OP somehow DIDN'T miss any radiation canisters, and those things still spawned...RIP. I doubt that's possible though, he must have had some unlucky runs in the palace which could have made him miss those rads. I know I've missed a few canisters before since missing EXP isn't that big of a deal around lategame, although one thing that irks me is how Hostile Horror is still allowed to spawn even after you unlock him. It leads me to believe that either the lore is SUPER DEEP, or it's a punishment system working as intended. Why you'd punish your players for LOSING rads, I'll never know. I really think they should just move Horror's unlock process to a secret area accessed from the Labs. That's just me though. I bet tons of people would complain about not being able to cheese him by having him spawn in the Sewers, so you can instakill him by opening the entrance to the Pizza Sewers. (Did you know that?)"

NuclearThrone,37v5sm,LazliiX,2,Sat May 30 19:08:44 2015 UTC,"One time I was playing Crystal and I got two shovels from a large weapon chest at 1-3. Sure, Steroids may have been better (ironically enough I was choosing between these two before the run started) for double melee, but when you have Q swap enabled you can basically get two strikes in quick succession, at the cost of needing to stop for a moment and ""reload"" the other melee weapon when you want to use this burst tactic again. Unfortunately I didn't get Trigger Fingers that round, but having Crystal's Throne Butt and some other neat mutations gave it interesting synergy. Then I died right before Lil' Hunter because my teleportation was bugged. Was really fun though. Teleporting in, giving enemies a quick double shovel slam and teleporting out. Double melee is pretty legit on anyone, provided you know what you're doing. I've had runs where I get a screwdriver and wrench early on, open the car at the scrapyard, then move over to a large weapon chest (which I had planned of course) and enter the mansion with at least my wrench and a decent ranged weapon. Sometimes I'm even lucky and get my hands on a sledgehammer.  Screw those dogs at the Palace, though. They have 170 HP which is 20 more than half of Big Dog's HP. They pretty much exist to eat your ammo before the throne deletes ALL of your ammo. Sounds like you had an amazing run, keep at it with melee weapons because once you're used to them you'll ALWAYS want one handy. Learning enemy AI helps too."

I think as long as you know how to control your space, double melee can be super viable.    That said, unless you have Laser Brain+Energy Sword or Energy Hammer, the first run through the Palace is a nightmare because of how tanky all the enemies are in comparison, especially the damn dogs.    Try to score Long Arms+Throne Butt+Trigger Fingers (and maybe Stress) on Chicken to get some real serious mileage out of your active ability with melee weapons."

You can go unbelievably fast as Plant, but I still think the title for ""Fastest Thing Alive"" goes to Fish with Throne Butt. At any rate, I figured I'd bring up a somewhat relevant discussion, as I'm completely unaware of how much speed Plant gets from his passive. As well as how much other mutants get from Extra Feet, how much total speed Plant gets from the mutation, if it stacks additively or multiplicatively, etc.  Speed is serious business, man. Unfortunately we can't race in those cars from the Scrapyard. I would kill for a race track level."

NuclearThrone,37uz6l,Tyrant_Kitten,2,Sat May 30 16:51:41 2015 UTC,"This happened to me the other day when using the Auto Grenade Shotgun. I believe what happens is that the portal opening destroys all projectiles on the screen, including your own, which means you can get hurt by explosive weapons. Since the portal opens at the exact same time as the death of the second Throne, you don't have any time to stop shooting either, so I guess you just have to pay close attention."
NuclearThrone,37uz6l,ideaot,2,Sat May 30 17:52:23 2015 UTC,"Oh. Y'know, I think it happens to ANYTHING that can blow up, such as the barrels you find in the Desert.

NuclearThrone,37vifz,purehatred89,1 point,Sat May 30 19:21:40 2015 UTC,"Well i can mean that too kind of. But i more likely think that theese would be fitting for like normal mutations. But for one character only. Some of them may sound a bit op, it must be because i'm kind of new to the game and i don't really play that character much [since i mostly play Melting and Chicken]."
NuclearThrone,37vifz,ZankaA,2,Sat May 30 19:26:57 2015 UTC,So like a second Throne Butt? lol.
NuclearThrone,37vifz,Tyrant_Kitten,2,Sat May 30 19:56:45 2015 UTC,Yeah. Something like that.
NuclearThrone,37vifz,TehBossaru,2,Sat May 30 20:01:31 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to agree with Hatred here. It's really hard to see your idea as anything that's not another Ultra Mutation or Throne Butt, simply because they all revolve around using your active ability. I'll admit, if there was a mutation similar to Throne Butt that gave character exclusive innate bonuses, which promoted synergy for said character, it could work. Now I'm not saying let's make a perk that JUST buffs your passive ability, but rather a mutation that gives various quality of life buffs instead of straight upgrades. In most cases, Throne butt and Ultra Mutations are simply direct upgrades rather than quality of life changes. Imagine if we got this perk that made Fish get more ammo, or Horror finds more rads. Simple stuff, y'know? What if we had a thing for Crystal that ""fears"" enemies who come too close to her during the shield, causing them to run away? Stuff like this. Things that add raw utility, rather than power to their kits. And even then it's difficult to implement such a concept when there aren't many unique options. Cause at the end of the day this mutation is literally Throne Butt 2.0. I'd still support an idea like this because most of the time Throne Butt is either mediocre, or something you can live without on even the most Throne Butt reliant mutants. An example is on Robot, I'd rather take Second Stomach over Throne Butt any day. Given your mutation choices at the time, there will be moments where you want to choose a different ""core"" perk for your character instead of Throne Butt. And having a mutation which gives you raw utility is a safe and interesting choice, in my opinion."

If there's one thing I wish the devs do after the game is out of Early Access is access to the GM:S source code. I can dream!

NuclearThrone,37n0j2,thefrdeal,0,Thu May 28 21:26:33 2015 UTC,"Are they going to fix the thing where if you die without a golden weapon, the weapons gets wiped from the character until you collect a new one? That really annoys me, when I played about a year ago every week my goal was to get a golden weapon for every player"

You will also be able to die without it and still have it unlocked as an option."
