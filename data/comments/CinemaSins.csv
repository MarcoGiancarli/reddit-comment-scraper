CinemaSins,3e2ym7,cinemasins,9,Tue Jul 21 15:39:52 2015 UTC,Sometimes I get this feeling that I should watch Mission Impossible.
CinemaSins,3e2ym7,StarPupil,4,Tue Jul 21 16:17:05 2015 UTC,"MI1 was a pretty good movie. Though it's my personal favorite of the series, it's not everyone's cup of tea. MI2 is all John Woo with a veneer of Mission: Impossible thinly glued on top. MI3 and MI4 are good action movies with a veneer of Mission: Impossible layered on top. They're not much more than that.  What sucks is the series just left Netflix. Now, it may just be my old fartness speaking, but that was good (if very formulaic) television. None of the movies captured what I thought made the series so engaging."
CinemaSins,3e2ym7,borticus,3,Tue Jul 21 16:26:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recommendation. I have occasionally heard people bemoan that the movies basically made it all about Tom Cruise. But only when I bring up that I have seen neither the show or the movies. Guess people agree with you!
CinemaSins,3e2ym7,StarPupil,5,Tue Jul 21 16:39:43 2015 UTC,"Discount Jesse Pinkman   But... but... that IS Aaron Paul.  Also I'm really impressed with all the Alias references. That show was awesome for the first two seasons.   Where these shadows on the ground suggest the sun is directly overhead   Those are very clearly long shadows, suggesting early morning or late afternoon. Obviously not sunrise, but still.

CinemaSins,3doh7z,trevdordurden,6,Fri Jul 17 23:07:40 2015 UTC,"Is it just me or do these brand sins seem to be of extraordinary low quality? Especially on the research department.   The video contains numerous mistakes that are trivial to prevent by a single google search, among others:   PS4 also requires money for online play You could buy a HD-DVD player for Xbox360. Furthermore the Xbox360 came out a year earlier than PS3 and was significantly cheaper. Bashing on it for having older and cheaper technology seems very strange, and bashing it for picking the wrong horse (HD-DVD) seems downright unfair. It's also not strange Xbox360 used the proven DVD technology when you consider that the PS3 blu-ray player was a major reason for it's high price and production issues. ""Xbox"" doesn't develop games, and Microsoft didn't develop any of the bad games listed Very shortly after Xbox one launch the requirement to pay for xbox live gold to use services was lifted.   Note: I'm not a MS/Xbox fanboy, I exclusively game on PC.  Also, missing a major sin: calling the third iteration of a product ""one"", thus creating confusion with the first xbox."

CinemaSins,3diih8,mr_mcsonsteinwitz,3,Thu Jul 16 21:59:58 2015 UTC,"That begs another question: what if you set a standard by naming other cities? Let's say my movie starts in Spokane. Off the top of my head, I can't name any landmarks there, so I imagine people not from Spokane wouldn't recognize it if they saw it (not that the real Spokane would be used--Hollywood would film in Vancouver or Cleveland or wherever gives them a tax break, thus shattering the illusion for people who know the substitute city well), so I flash Spokane on the screen. Later, the story takes us to Portland, so we throw Portland up on the screen. If we continue to make our way south, and end up in, say... San Francisco (gotta have our climactic fight on the Golden Gate Bridge, yo), wouldn't it be sinful to not name the city, given the others got the same treatment?"

Oh, I see the Westboro Baptists turned their pitchforks on Superman.  4. ""These people are rightly justified at being angry at me for killing all those innocent people"" face.  5. I think my favorite thing is when superhero movies give us Senate hearings and courtroom drama.  6. Is he... standing up for the hearing like he's on the People's Court?!  7. Revisionist history bails out filmmakers.  5. This scene of Bruce running INTO the debris cloud while everyone else runs out?! 2 sins off motherfuckers. That shit is rad.  6. Okay goddammit. You sold me. I BUY Bruce being angry at Superman because of this. But did you have to get so heavy-handed with the proximity of the touching hug to the obvious Wayne Enterprises logo? Answer: No, no you did not.  7. silence (FROM DIRECTOR ZACK SNYDER)  8. A field! A flooded place! Papers!!  7. This is pretty clearly the Joker, somehow escaped or something in this universe, taunting Batman. And since that looks like a regular letter with a postmark and a stamp, I'm guessing Joker knows Batman is Bruce and mailed this to Wayne Manor. Regardless... knowing Affleck is going to direct his own stand alone Batman movie, and knowing the Joker is out there in the wild in that universe... makes me EXTREMELY excited. One sin removed.  8. But... that tower came down like that and only dozens were killed? Dozens? Was it a fucking Sunday? That's... miraculous! You should celebrate that shit.  9. Bruce Wayne does CrossFit!  10. I kind of love this bat-suit. I do. I don't love how much it resembles duct-tape, but other than that... awesome. But duct tape. (Yes, he does use two different conjugations for duct-tape. Check the video.)  11. Whoa, Alfred is like, only ten years older than Bruce in this version. That's the youngest dam Alfred I've ever seen, though perhaps that's only because I refuse to watch Gotham. (This is a sin on Jeremy.)  10. Holy shit, Batman in this world is fucking BRANDING fools! That's amazing! One sin removed!  11. Really? I'd think newspaper readership would LOVE Batman stories, both pro and con. You want to sell papers, right?  12. And I'm still fucking floored a movie universe that's trying so hard to feel real still went with the eyeglasses-only disguise for Clark Kent!  13. Superman comes to save people, but apparently waits for them to scrawl his logo first... and then hovers dramatically for a moment as though he might not actually save them.  14. Also, this house, this house, this house, and this house all have residents on the roof waiting for rescue. This house... it's residents are fucking dead, man. That's depressing.  15. Cool shot, but even a farm in Kansas isn't free enough of light pollution (Jeremy says: ""these days"" here, but doesn't have it in the text.) to have this kind of view of the Milky Way.  16. Is he just standing there because... he likes this? Or... is it taking him a really long time to realize how awkward this is? Why was he standing along by himself long enough for all these people to surround him anyway? And why are so many of them sporting the I Like Turtles kid's face paint?  17. Is Superman literally among the spectators watching this missile launch? Cause... otherwise... how the fuck is he able to catch the top part of it?!  18. Ah! Zuckerberg!  19. Zod's dead, but... if you're showing him to me here... it makes me wonder...  18. Gah! I called it! That IS a dead-Robin shrine in the Bat-cave! One sin removed for this trailer making me look like a genius after the last trailer!  19. Why are these Superman soldiers bowing down to Superman, and why is he walking through them like he ACCEPTS their worship?!  20. Also, Darth Superman.  21. Now, I've always questioned the logic of the bat-signal, but am generally able to chalk it up to comic book silliness. But THIS Bat signal looks... stupid as hell. This could ONLY project a smudgy blob inside a white circle up into the sky. (Two different ways of typing bat-signal. Again, check the video.)  22. Also, I can only assume he's calling Superman here, since traditionally this signal is used to call Batman himself, but this time he's the one who turned it on. My question is... how is Superman supposed to know what this means?!  23. Also... why did you include a cape on the mechanical bat-suit? Does it still omehow [sic] help your now-two-ton-ass float on air? Cause I don't think it could. (Also, Jeremy changes his punctuation after ""Also"" between sins)  24. Oh yeah, this movie's almost a year away still. Awesome. Um... what are you going to use to promote this movie over the next 10 months without spoiling everything?!  25. Scuba diving, horses!! (Jeremy changes the way he punctuates this type of sin when compared to #8.)  26. Bats flying at the camera? Been there. Bruce's parents die? Done that.  27. Let's hope this shot of some kind of bat plane flying over an apocalypse looks less fake-as-shit in the real movie.  28. Okay, this shot of her in a sexy dress getting into a car could LITERALLY be from one of the Fast & Furious movies and I personally would never notice.  29. Also, that dude is TOTALLY staring at her ass (No period is included here.)  30. Whoa, Wonder Woman?! The fuck is SHE doing in this world. Isn't she a magical Amazonian goddess or something? Does that jive with a universe - oh fucking who cares?  31. Desert Storm Batman.  32. Oh, goodie. Kryptonite. The cause of and solution to all of the problems related to Superman on TV or film.  33. In beating Superman's ass for destroying buildings, Batman destroys a building.  34. Also... here's some of that famous wide-ranging Zach Snyder color palette on display here.  32. Freezing this shot here. If you're a huge Batman comic nerd, you know why I'm also taking off two more sins.  33. But also, if Batman doesn't get out of there in time... is Superman ready to have just murdered him? Cause he would have, right?  34. Is that a red-coats-are-coming reference? Or... (Jeremy says ""just"" here, but doesn't have it in the text.) some obscure Superman comic reference I'm not getting. It's creepy the way he says it, but I just with I had... some idea... what the fuck it meant.  35. Um, guys, those are gas pumps on fire right there. I'm just saying, maybe an angry bro staredown isn't the best idea in this exact location.  36. I still think this smooshed-together logo thing is horrid.  Now for some other tallies!   9 uses of fuck v 4 uses of shit 24 uses of ellipses 10 uses of Batman v 13 uses of Superman 28 uses of exclamation points v 29 uses of question marks   Conclusion: Fuck... Superman?  Is there something you're subliminally trying to tell us Jeremy?"

But they weren't even in a biker club or anything, how did the Terminator randomly find 3 punk kids at night.

T1K's burning corpse sounds like a Dinosaur Transformers, fuck you Hollywood for what it did to sound design.  ""I know how time travel works, I did it once"".  Kyle Reese is a machine racist.  Also Skynet is Discount Google's/Apple's Cloud.  Terminator John Connor is also a Discount Agent Smith.  Bad Boys track playing at sundown? Does this movie not know it's about to end?.  And what the ever living fuck. Sarah  can enter a Skynet vault/door that seems to be locked by ID? And the vault door is a bomb shelter? and the entire building falls but not IT? And it has plot-ready chairs for the characters to chat about stuff?."

In the very last shot, Spock is wearing the green band and McCoy is wearing the orange one. When Spock's shuttle is lining up to dock with the Enterprise, look below the shuttle and you can see the hydraulic mechanism used to maneuver it. (This is the equivalent of spotting the camera man!)  When the Enterprise first leaves space dock, the deflector array is orange until warp speed, then it's blue. Inside V'Ger, it alternates from orange to blue. V'ger turns out to be ""Voyager 6"" because the ""oya"" and ""6"" are covered in dirt. V'ger would not know this and its memory would still be programmed to call itself ""voyager"". It would be like if a the label of a computer, say, let's say ""Dell"" had the ""D"" covered up, the boot-up screen would not read, ""ell"" during post, it would still read, ""Dell"" When the travel pod arrives at the Enterprise with Scotty and Kirk, The computer says ""Travel pod available Cargo 6"", but the sign above the door says ""5"".

They say that the starboard side of the ship took damage, yet later in the movie there is no visible damage. Spocks funeral takes place in Torpedo Bay 2, but it's location was destroyed earlier in the movie. Kirk's Blood Stain from Scott's Nephew can't stay put Why would Khan be the only one aging even though he and the rest of his crew were marooned there 20 years ago? Khan forgets the difference between 200 and 300 years. KHAAAN! Kirstie Alley isn't my girlfriend in this scene. So, Khan is supposed to be this superhuman genetically enhanced guy, right? What would he have done to exact his revenge if the Reliant didn't come through? I mean, sure, he's smart, but there's LITERALLY nothing to use. Maybe he'd kill (or bury alive) Kirk in the afterlife? Chekov was actually not in the show during the 'Space Seed' episode. One may argue that he was on the ship, and therefor seen, but it's not like they had a discussion. Remember, he spent most of his time with the historian lady and Kirk. (""I never forget a face) The power of dead wife boners. (Khan's motivation) How does Khan's people know how to pilot the starship? It resembles nothing of that of the Original Series Enterprise, and during the ""Genesis"" data transfer, it shows him not knowing where the manual override is. (After first attack) Speaking of which, how does he know if the manual override would've worked? The conversation between Spock and Kirk in the Genesis cave should have been useless. Remember, he said that days are like hours, hours like minutes, and Khan is listening in. A normal person would've understood the 'secret' (re: horrible) code.

Apostrophes should be in their proper places, missing letters, etc. i.e ""theyr"", ""wheres"", ""did'nt"".  Make sure you proof your video. Don't just finish the edit and upload it; check the spelling/grammar, make sure the cuts are clean, etc.    Sorry if I sound ruthless.

The Terminator fights were enjoyable at least. The part where Arnold hits John into the air, and he recovers before he hits the ground was the only part me and friend looked at each other and said ""whoa"".  Shout out to Matt Smith though. Broke the moment for me and my buddy when he appeared on screen. Immediately I said out loud, ""Is that Matt Smith?"" I knew he wasn't just going to be a background character, so I was waiting for his moment.   Overall, wouldn't really recommend anybody to actively seek and watch it, but it's definitely watchable."

I mean, I agree that it's an overwhelmingly awesome scene overall, but it's still quite a lucky coincidence to make the scene more guilt-free. Especially considering that even the Westboro Baptist church had kids in attendance.  Two: Arthur literally fell for the oldest trick in the book when Eggsy asked about one of the photos. He actually fell for the ""Made you look"" cliche. And he's supposed to be the fucking head of this spy organization!"

I could not be bothered to list them but alot of the ones I noticed while watching the film made it into the video.  The biggest one I noticed was that Valentine had to keep his hand on the biometric table the whole time the human brawl was occurring meaning that until everybody had killed each other he would not be allowed to leave his position at the table.

K for Kids and A for Adult doesn't leave much room for in between.  For example: The Dark Knight trilogy.   Batman Begins, while creepy in a few places, really isn't an ""adults only"" movie. It can definitely be watched by a younger audience. If I had to pick just one out of the two options to rate it, I'd say K is fine, because a 12 year old should be fine to see that movie.  The Dark Knight has some pretty intense scenes that a 5-12 year old would definitely be disturbed by, so I'd say A for adults only? What about the teenagers 12-15 that want to see the movie and can't?  The Dark Knight Rises is the least intense so I'd say K for that as well.  I just feel like there should be some middle ground instead of just ""Do"" or ""Do not""."

Also, I feel like objectivity would be a better way to go. K means totally kid friendly, T means there's cursing/suggestive material (sexual themes or drug use, for example), and A means gore/nudity. The cutoffs could be at, say, 13 and 16.  Just to really illustrate the point, Pixar movies would be K, the last Harry Potter movie and the Hangover would be T, and A would be Saw."

Today you get things like MK X and Bloodburn where instead of everyone going crazy about ""Blood"" everyone is actually admiring how pretty it looks. The scales have evolved, and so does the ESRB if wants to stay relative. Putting things like Hatred in Adult Rating simply due to ""killing"" is stupid.

So no, they don't. And there's a lot of other shit to talk about why they don't, too."
CinemaSins,3bugss,Rhyfel,3,Thu Jul 2 17:03:03 2015 UTC,"In the UK we have a weird classification system Uc (Young children) U (Universal) PG (Parental Guidance)  12a (12, unless accompanied by an adult) 15  18  It's broken up into too many segments, we need a system like Cinema Sin's which basically says 15 is the cutoff between watching Frozen or Saw."
CinemaSins,3bugss,MarcXJF,3,Thu Jul 2 08:39:59 2015 UTC,"Nah- just get rid of UC (because nobody cares about it) and 12A, because it is effectively PG considering that I have never seen any kids under the age of 12 alone at the cinema for any film ever. Or at least that's my two cents on the matter."
CinemaSins,3bugss,impossiblefan,2,Thu Jul 2 09:47:18 2015 UTC,"Luckily, Uc has been abolished since 2009 and was only used on home releases, not cinema releases; the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification/Censors) rates cinema releases, adverts for movies, and home releases.  12A is cinema release only, and there's another classification missing: R18. Though that's only for certain kinds of movies ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"

CinemaSins,3bn2tc,twitchedawake,8,Wed Jul 1 10:09:46 2015 UTC,"Technically,  Skynets plan could have made sense to it and it just doesnt to us because we arent intelligent enough to comprehend the scope of the plan.  Heres a good discussion on AI  Basically, the Superintelligent AI, which skynet was supposed to be, is so much more intelligent than us,  that itd be like trying to explain Architecture to an earthworm. Skynets plan may seem like it was serendipity, but it could have all be planed based on its understanding of how humans would react to a imbedded and subliminal  programed machine. Skynet programed Marcus so its known how itd react, and to skynet, humans might as well be gradeschool math problems, it knows how they'd react to certain situations.  Its still sinful as shit that the movie never mentioned this and treats a computer system that basically put humans on the endangered list as a Bond villain."
CinemaSins,3bn2tc,FuriousFap42,2,Tue Jun 30 20:16:54 2015 UTC,"Well but then it would have to work, and it doesn't. If by the end, everything would fall into place for skynet, then yes, but it gets blown up and most resistance members are still alive"

CinemaSins,3bn2tc,Jimm607,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:36:04 2015 UTC,"Well but then it would have to work   plans fail though, even those set about by a self aware AI, as seen in literally every terminator movie Skynets plans aren't in anyway guarenteed to be a success."
CinemaSins,3bn2tc,FuriousFap42,2,Wed Jul 1 10:13:26 2015 UTC,"we arent intelligent enough to comprehend the scope of the plan.   That was what I was referring to. If it evaluated this super complicated plan as having a higher likelihood of success than the more direct plans that we can think of based on its recourses that we have seen, that would most likely work, then this plan, would have to succeed if it really would be a super intelligent AI"
CinemaSins,3bn2tc,Jimm607,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:39:46 2015 UTC,"again not really, even the most complex plans can be fucked up if the wrong part gets too badly done over. The problem is that Skynet isn't human, we shouldn't be trying to apply human thought processes to it. Obviously, its not what the creators intended, but i think that the 'we're not intelligent enough' is better explained by 'we can't make the connections it does'. Its plan seems odd to us because its following a different set of steps that don't seem intuitive to us, and we likely don't have all the factors Skynet would have integrated?  The problem i think is that when Jeremy asks why Skynet is doing x as part of there plan and concludes because he can't think of a reason, there must be no reason, its taking a really boring approach to the problem, Skynet isn't people, its plans are naturally going to be unintuitive to us, we only have the facts the humans have been exposed to, only have human thought processes to determine the best approach and assuming that Skynet is dumb because its not following the human approach with only half informed assumptions about Skynets motivation is just asking yourself to be dissappointed.  But then maybe i spend too much time in /r/plotholes and /r/fantheories and take too much enjoymnt out of making sense of poorly thoughtout movies."
CinemaSins,3bn2tc,FuriousFap42,2,Wed Jul 1 10:53:07 2015 UTC,"we shouldn't be trying to apply human thought processes to it   I wasn't, I was applying a probabilistic ""thought"" process. I admittedly do not have deep knowledge of AI, but I know quite a bit about supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Skynet was made by humans, and since they somehow ignore the singularity in that movie, and what it would bring with it, that means it could not override his core programming. So it would always choose the most likely path to succeed while ruling out options that would jeopardise the plan as a hole, even if the risks would be relatively small.    and we likely don't have all the factors Skynet would have integrated?   True, but we could see logic flaws that come out of an action directly contradicting a goal.   Example: If the Terminator is trying to kill John, then using two, or more would increase the likelihood a lot. So would snapping his neck, instead of chocking him. And if this is not the goal, throwing him around, could kill him, so whether it wants to kill him or not, it makes stupid moves in both instances."
CinemaSins,3bn2tc,confluencer,5,Wed Jul 1 11:22:47 2015 UTC,"Does anyone else use CinemaSins not only as a piece off entertaining satire, but a really quick and efficient way to see movies you would otherwise not have the fortitude to sit through?

Tomorrowland.  00:10 Cause an entire movie dedicated to a Disney theme park is not enough, you must also endure a thematic Disney Intro. Disney is the new 20/21 Century Fox.  02:20 Lyrical Roll Credits.  03:10 Scene does not contain Tony Stark - Stark Senior somewhere in the background.  04:40 Kid survives this.  05:00 House is a dick to kids.  06:20 Asshole cliche. And even sillier since the thing obviously has potential.  08:00 If people have to wait for the next boat, why are there empty boats.  08:45 What if Frank had the pin on it's pocket. Does the lazer have X Ray too just inc ase.  11:00 If the Architect shows up, I am out.  12:30 Just in case the audience needed to understand.  13:40 How convenient that the kid didn't fell all the way on the first fall. And that the robot fixed the Jetpack. And that the Jetpack fell beside the kid. And that the fall was that high.  13: Also a weird place to have a teleporter station landing zone, thousands of feet above the city.  15:20 That face.  16:00 Great.  16:40 Rock plays to imply rebelness.  20:50 Heavy handed dialog keeps trying to hammer the fact that people don't have ideas and this character has.  23:30 Oh they dragged por Radek Zelenka into this haven't they.  24: Oh they dragged poor Carson Beckett into this haven't they.  29:25 Miming.  35:59 5 minutes of Tomorrow-land watching.  36:30 Ah the WWW, the place to find everything and nothing.  37:50 Where the fuck were you, this whole time, if you were there to give the girl the pin in the first place.  42:30 10 Grand? Do they have that cash? If they do I would have lied some bullshit to get it rather than just walk away.  43:00 Hilarity Bird.  143:00 Impossible Misses.  43:35 In movies if you just shout someone's name enough they appear on the next shot.  44:35 Time Bomb speeds up degenerating to add tension.  44:55 Discount Spy Kids.  46:50 Well you were just not there, you had plenty of time before the girl ran of.  47:25 Discount Terminator 2.  48:00 Grand Theft Auto.  48:15 So you believe on a teleporting pin of time travel, but not robots. Did the writer told you to try to add tension.  48:55 You already knew that.  49:40 OkeydokieAndAightrlyTexas.  50 CUTE DOGGY.  53:00 Casey never saw someone wake up ever in'er life.  54 In case the audience didn't recall what the kid looked like.  56:15 Nobody sane would ever try to pet the dog's MOUTH to find out if was a hologram or not. If wasn't you would have no arms left.  57:25 For ce Push? Is George Clooney a Jedi?.  58:00 Cool reveal. But a lot of issues with this. If it runs on a timer-battery, what if the person walked the other way. But George implies everyone sees the ""Saved you a seat just for you"" as the last part of the tour.  1:00:40 So the House, has Force Push?.  1:01:40 Character finds easy to find character-personality display thing for character-personality display.  1:06:20 Interrupt this movie to bring you, Bourne Identity's House of Madness.  1:12:30 Exposition Item for later use.  1:14:35 Neat little reveal that Frank loved a robot, that would surely be wasted later on a prolongeued and lame reveal-reveal dialog.  1:21:30 Nic Cage is somewhere there trying to figure out how this connects to templar treasure.  :1:22:20 Nobody that Paris for a living notices this shit.  1:22;50 Or at the very least, nobody is scrambling jets the second they see this.  1:29:35 No but really. Why does it not matter.  1:33;25 Google;s VR-Hololans Earth.  1:309:20 Pretty sure you lost that pin at some point during the fight with the 2 robots.  1:40:30 This is the movie's smartest idea, that 7 billion something, specially sentient humans, honestly believing on something, would CAUSE something. But the idea is wasted so that the audience can keep track of the plot and replace d with ""Have to destroy it"" line.  1:44:25 Cool speech. But seriously. That still follows the idea of letting earth see a bright feature and that would fix things.  1:45:25 Discount Ed 209.  1:46:30 Discount Rock and Sock Em robots.  1:48 The Bomb, has a Voicebox?.  1:49 So, Athena broke the universe by changin timeline?.  Also good thing that tachyon prediction was detailed and long enough.  1:50:30 Everything has a voicebox.  1:53:22 Oh fuck off with that jetpack-ex machina throwback.  1:56:28 Oh fuck off with that cheap throwback line writing.  1:57:20 So the movie just lied that they were doing a recording, and now they don't look straight at the camera, cause there isn't one.  2:00:50 Even Tomorrowland's ads become an MMO after a while."

CinemaSins,3bi8b7,PabloThePirate,3,Thu Jul 2 05:25:36 2015 UTC,"I'd like to request the movie South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut. List of sins: 1) When the kids (Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny) are told that they can't see Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire as it's rated R and they're only 8, Cartman says that it's probably not that good anyway. Kyle objects by saying that Cartman loves Terrance and Phillip, and Cartman says, ""Yeah, but the animation's all crappy."" But later, Terrance and Phillip show up, demonstrating that they're real people. How can the movie in which they appeared be animated if they're real, and look exactly the same in real life as they did in the movie? 2) In the song ""Blame Canada"", some of the members of the Mothers Against Canada want Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire to be replaced with a censored and ""MPAA-approved"" version, implying that the version that came out in theatres wasn't approved by the MPAA. But earlier in the movie, it was stated that Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire was rated R. If the MPAA didn't approve it, it would've been NR (not rated), not R. 3) In the aforementioned song ""Blame Canada"", Stan's mom calls Terrance and Phillip: Asses of Fire a ""cartoon"". But, as mentioned in my Sin #1, that movie can't be a cartoon, since Terrance and Phillip are shown to be real people in-universe."

In the very last shot, Spock is wearing the green band and McCoy is wearing the orange one. When Spock's shuttle is lining up to dock with the Enterprise, look below the shuttle and you can see the hydraulic mechanism used to maneuver it. (This is the equivalent of spotting the camera man!) When the Enterprise first leaves space dock, the deflector array is orange until warp speed, then it's blue. Inside V'Ger, it alternates from orange to blue. V'ger turns out to be ""Voyager 6"" because the ""oya"" and ""6"" are covered in dirt. V'ger would not know this and its memory would still be programmed to call itself ""voyager"". It would be like if a the label of a computer, say, let's say ""Dell"" had the ""D"" covered up, the boot-up screen would not read, ""ell"" during post, it would still read, ""Dell"" When the travel pod arrives at the Enterprise with Scotty and Kirk, The computer says ""Travel pod available Cargo 6"", but the sign above the door says ""5"".

Why not show only Arnie fighting Arnie, some action scene with the liquid metal Terminator, and then the last scene of the trailer is just a short shot of Johns face and then Saras saying:""John?""    Aliens    ? Alien had one of the best trailers ever, at least the first one."

CinemaSins,3b1faw,PiotrElvis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"I knew about the Sweeny Tood one. I liked the movie, but I understand that people could be quite upset. I often don't like Cracked, because they have to act like they are stupid to make things funny. I am refering to this   See, McAdams works at a hotel where an important political figure is staying, and Murphy wants her to transfer the VIP to a waterside room so they can fire a giant missile into it from the ocean, because Murphy is apparently the kind of terrorist who is OK with political assassination but horrified at the thought of collateral damage. Oh, except he'll have McAdams' father murdered if she doesn't cooperate. So ... wait, what?   booking him in that room was probably not to avoid civilian casualties, but so that they can hit him from the see. Their rocket is not infinitively strong.   They often do that kind of stuff, where they make up plot holes by purposefully misconstruing things.   But the list is good."
CinemaSins,3b1faw,FuriousFap42,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:41:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, and that gives us a look at the opposite of spoilers in the trailers, showing us something completely different than the real movie."
CinemaSins,3b1faw,PiotrElvis,2,Fri Jun 26 10:35:49 2015 UTC,"Well it should be none of the two. Show me some character motivation, some of your best visuals, without context if you must, a few shots of all main characters involved as long as this does not give away a plot twist, a show me the tone. Is it a action movie, a lighthearted comedy, a Drama, show it through the music and lighting. That should not be that hard"
CinemaSins,3b1faw,FuriousFap42,3,Fri Jun 26 10:59:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know, on the one hand, there are good trailers that don't spoil a thing (I'm thinking of Wreck it Ralph at the moment. Only because I distinctly remember not figuring out the reveal until we were on our way to the theater, and only because a particular reviewer I liked had said just a bit too much in his review.) But, on the other hand, there are trailers that reveal way more about the movie than the studio intended (now I'm thinking of that one CG Wizard of Oz movie that apparently skipped theaters, and thank god for that, the trailers made it look HORRIBLE.)  However, there are trailers that give you a good feeling for what the movie will be without flat out saying what's going on in the movie (I want to cite Winter Soldier in particular, but, really, most of the more recent Marvel movie trailers have been decent. Imagine how much they could have revealed in Iron Man 3? No one knew about Mandarin's true story until the movie.)"
CinemaSins,3b1faw,CelestDaer,2,Thu Jun 25 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"But what the movie did with Mandarin is also terrible tho, so the movie actually tricked the audience into believing the movie was any good."
CinemaSins,3b1faw,CelestDaer,4,Thu Jun 25 23:10:47 2015 UTC,"That's not the point of why I brought up the Mandarin, I brought it up because it was a well-guarded secret up until the movie actually hit theaters, which could have been revealed in the trailer if they hadn't been extremely careful in crafting the trailers."

It's about this new dinosaur who ate her sister, kills others for sport, suddenly becomes a danger by escaping containment, is highly intelligent and genetically modified, and can communicate.   Also, anyone who saw Jurassic World knows what a flare gun means, coupled with the fact that there is now something that can be 50x bigger than a T-rex on the loose.

I have to say you are very easy to offend, to the point where  I wonder how the idea of 'sins' videos doesn't get to you.  I just started to wonder. I don't understand this whole using the lords name in vain thing. Does he have to much on his hands to damn a movie? does he have other things to worry about? But then you get to the idea that god really cares about homosexuality and apparently has the time to damn gays. You may not believe in damning gays but there are people who do think god has the time.

As if me offending you is the only argument you need. It's not.  This IS an open forum for ideas, I had an IDEA that you should stop complaining about such negligible things, I had an IDEA that you shouldn't censor the word you want banned. If you can prove that goddamn offensive words in your free entertainment is important in some way, I'll happily retract all of my points and suck you off wearing a gimp suit. Luckily there's only 0% possibilty I'll have to do it on such a limp-dicked pansy arse.  And please, if you respond, don't use the fact that I insulted you as your only argument. Maybe you could try and come back at me. ANY goddamn point would make me at least respect you (though only 1 point isn't going to get me to do what I said last paragraph).  Also, sorry my reply was so late, I had to go to sleep since it was getting late.  I agree 99% with /u/arUQohr3XT87 (It must be a nightmare logging in with that username), but I don't think you should filter out stuff that offends you.

CinemaSins,3aumww,Airlight,3,Fri Jun 26 13:25:55 2015 UTC,"Love cinema sins, however I tend to prefer actual plot holes or leaps of logic pointed out, where they make an actual point. Most of the points here are not in any way sins, and some are just pure jokes with no comment on the subject being joked about.  For example, the film shows us Dyson looking at the arm in the lab, to make sure the film is self-contained enough. That's only a positive, and in no way a ""sin"".  Don't worry, I really like these videos in general, but these sins feel almost entirely fabricated, and I prefer the ones with more meat to them. Here there's 1 legitimate question or point for every 5 sins, it seems.  And some points are just wrong on every level. For example. Sin 28: The T-1000 did not know that another Terminator had been sent back to interfere with him. I think the CS guys were refering to the moment moment where John's foster parents tells the T1000 ""There was another guy here looking for him this morning / Yeah, big guy on a bike..."". The T1000 looks up and says ""No, I wouldn't worry about him..."".  That beat is intended purely for the audience to let us know The T800 was there prior. The T1000 would have no reason to believe some other Terminator had been sent back, much less to the same day as him. As far as the T1000 knows, his best bet is to stay in character and act as whatever stereotype of a police officer he has been programmed with.  I just felt it had to be said. Still lots of valid points and plot device sins brought up."
CinemaSins,3aumww,ThatCanadianPerson,2,Wed Jun 24 15:59:02 2015 UTC,"There were a few sins that I would have included   John rides a Honda XR100, a four stroke bike, in the chase scene through the LA River, yet the editors used a two stroke exhaust note, this is a lack of communication on set. They very easily could have given him a two stroke bike. Advanced killing machine from the future with extensive knowledge of weapons, doesn't know to keep his booger hooker off the bang switch, that's how you get negligent discharges and accidentally kill the leader of the resistance."

EDIT 2: Okay Ive seen the Sarah turns off the Terminator int he garage and Miles Dyson daytime scenes, but only in AMC or basic cable versions so they can pad the time for more commercials putting in unnecessary deleted scenes. What version did you watch? The ""James Cameron fires the editor"" edition?  EDIT 3: Christ Jeremy, I bought your book so I think I have some entitlement here. You seem to be angry at the extensive, drawn out, over expository scenes and clearly you're watching a cut of this movie with all the deleted scenes added in. THAT'S WHY it feels boring when John Conner or Miles Dyson is explaining stuff, it was cut from the movie for that reason. You're adding sins for a non-canon cut of the movie. You're acting like a Vegan in a Ruth Chris, and you'd be a shitty date my man.  EDIT 4: Eh, I'm rambling, why stop now?

CinemaSins,3auvzc,Explains_Your_Glitch,3,Tue Jun 23 18:56:38 2015 UTC,"I agree there are other ways out of some situations, but I'm talking about the ones where the writers set up the situation with the intention of a deus ex machina being the only way out. Sinning the solution makes it seem like the writers put them in a problem and then went, ""crap, how do we fix this?"" because that's how the viewer goes through the series of events. But the writers already know how it is going to end. They know who is really wearing the mask. They purposely put them in sitations that only a deus ex machina could get them out of.  But now I wonder if the deus ex machina sin is only given to situations where there is a better way out. Hmm..."
CinemaSins,3auvzc,Explains_Your_Glitch,3,Tue Jun 23 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"He can still sin it for the writers making it require a deus ex machine, and rather than explain that every time, just use the DEM sin. In my opinion, it's even more sinful if the writers did it on purpose, rather than accidentally writing themselves into a corner and resorting to a DEM."
CinemaSins,3auvzc,FuriousFap42,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:55:43 2015 UTC,"Right, the intentional one is more sinful, and I agree that it is too hard to explain it every time and the DEM sin works well as a template. But a viewer might look at a DEM sin and say, ""But the only alternative is for the hero to die!"" and they would be correct because no amount of quality or ""unsinful"" writing could get them out, so ""not sinning"" isn't a viable solution. If the sin is for the lazy writing where they are just planning on resorting to a DEM to fix it, the alternative is better writing."
CinemaSins,3auvzc,FuriousFap42,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:29:45 2015 UTC,"Well they always could simply set up the solution before hand. Then it would not be a DEM. Like in the movie fight, ghost army vs. eagles. We saw where th GA came from, we saw a character go to them, and talk with them. No such thing for the eagles. Why not do always something like that. When in the Expandables, some guy comes up out of no where and saves the day, why not show him first at least one time, why he went there?"
CinemaSins,3auvzc,FuriousFap42,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:10:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm, so you're saying that the situation could be just as impossible with just as much suspense and could be saved by someone or something previously set up that you either forgot about or didn't expect to happen right then? Yeah, that could work.  But I think the appeal of the DEM situations are that no one in the audience will expect it, and so it seems like a hopeless situation. If it was set up beforehand, there is a much greater chance of the audience thinking about that as a possible out when they are worrying about how the hero will survive, and so there is a lot less guarantee of suspense."
CinemaSins,3auvzc,pyth1100,2,Fri Jun 26 16:32:46 2015 UTC,"so there is a lot less guarantee of suspense.   Yes less of a guarantee, but you can set it up in a way that most people have forgotten about it in that situation. Just put the set up 10min earlier. Then make the situation so intense, that everyone forgot about the other thing.   Example: A Superhero film, like the Avengers, one character gets separated from the team at some point, they keep on fighting, you see the seperated member again, speaking into his radio, ""I am coming back guys"". Then a lot of fighting, it all gets super intense, the bad guy has them pinned, and suddenly the lost member comes up from behind him and fucks him up a bit.   Or when they get some way to kill the unkillable bad guy. Why not have someone mention what might be necessary to kill that bad guy, or give small hints about it. At least have some half logical thing, like the Sandman being week against water. But Cuck Norris coming out of no where, or the Terminator having a hart suddenly, that is BS."
CinemaSins,3auvzc,pyth1100,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:26:49 2015 UTC,"I do agree with you. If there are better ways of getting out of a situation, those should be used and I don't understand why they aren't. Cough it up to lazy writing, but I'm pretty lazy and if I can easily think of a much better solution, then ""lazy writing"" doesn't explain it.  I'm mainly focusing on the situations like the eagles where only a DEM could save them. There are no other options. All the good guys are accounted for. They are guaranteed to lose as the situation currently stands. Nothing currently known could change that, so the only way something different could happen is if something unknown does so. Gandalf uses a previously-unused spell. The dwarfs take out their ""special"" axes. Eagles show up just in the nick of time. In those situations, the writers put the characters there knowing that only a DEM could get them out.

CinemaSins,3agzx5,Rhyfel,8,Sat Jun 20 02:27:11 2015 UTC,"I love this shit. Cause I agree to most of the arguments made, but Chris is far better eloquent .  The argument on recent movies trying to catch on what was hype once, and how most don't know or recall WHY they were hyped in the first place, thus leaving a movie with the same type of scenes but to an aware viewer, feels emptier, is a very good 1.  There's a lot of that in Jurassic World. The second Wilson Fisk came up on screen to talk about how Raptors would be a great military addition, and then was petting the Raptors and they were getting all mad. I knew the Raptors would eat Fisk eventually in the movie. And the reason is cause the movie was setting that up cause ""Having a character that taunts a character to then get it's comeuppance "" it's funny.  But its not if you don't set that up properly first, just having a character do that can be empty. Characters need a base for conflict first.  And the thing with the fishy monster was almost fun, half the movie could have been a tour of attractions in JW, and shit that ONLY JW could do (Like lower an entire audience next to a tank of a fish monster, which was terrifying). But instead the movie spent a lot of time trying to cash in on ""Kids are dumb"" thing, which was fine in the first movie, cause ""Kids are dumb"" is apart of the JP series at this point, and cause well yes, Kids are dumb. But again it tried to do so without setting up shit properly, and in order to make any sense you have to have shit like the bubble ride be MANUALLY DRIVEN so that the characters could literally drive into the plot. While, maybe not but as far as can recall, in the first movie the Jeep drove itself auto on a rail, and still was able to put characters in danger without having to give them control of the camera pod."

Just a heaping mass of wasted potential, that's exactly what the film was."

CinemaSins,3ah6na,squaresarerectangles,4,Sat Jun 20 16:54:19 2015 UTC,"As far as plot goes, I've never felt blomkamp does phenomenally, and this movie is no exception. However, I think his strong suit is really his ability to create intricately atmospheric movies. Chappie was a great example of this; the way he blended Die antwoord's performance, along with a kick-ass soundtrack and beautiful sets, made the perfect atmosphere for the movie's cyberpunk-meets-gangsta vibe. Also, blokamp's storytelling is fantastic, and the way he told the story of these ridiculous characters was so much fun to watch."

Overall, there was a lot of potential there to really dig into what defines life and consciousness, and I guess that the lack of delving into this subject deeper just seemed like a missed opportunity for me. Blomkamp is really great at making visually engaging universes, and he has a real talent for creating post-apocalyptic/dystopian eye-candy, but the subject matter of his films always just feels paper thin ... I guess that's what I don't like about it the most."

CinemaSins,3a8qvl,pyth1100,2,Thu Jun 18 15:31:20 2015 UTC,"But, here's the issue I have with this.  With a weekly thread, everyone takes a look at it each week, thus gets more traffic.  With post based. If you make a thread about James Bond, with 3 sins. Then someone has 170 Sins for James Bond 4 days later. It would be more organized to simply add a comment to said thread, than creating a new one. How ever no one is going to go BACK to the 4 day old thread that just had 3 sings, to read new comments.  So 170 sins go by missed.  Tho if it's weekly, it's all in one place, so people tend to notice more, and if not, they will when the new one comes up.  If laz is really part of the issue, I mean. I can write a sticky Weekly Post thingy each week, surely. If you guys want. While the request activity might be lower, the viewing said request activity would be even lower with individual threads I thinks. And if you had all in one place, maybe you have only a few requests, but they get read a lot."

CinemaSins,39v9lb,blitzzardpls,12,Mon Jun 15 20:16:32 2015 UTC,This whole episode felt like I was watching a spoof. It was so scattered and I don't know almost cartoony?

CinemaSins,39v9lb,MsAlyssa,7,Mon Jun 15 02:28:14 2015 UTC,My exact thoughts during the final scene
CinemaSins,39v9lb,Flaccidmonkeys,6,Mon Jun 15 02:18:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think the story is engaging because I should be rooting for someone, although I am, of course, most of us can't help it. The story is unpredictable, like life and that's fun. Even so, the story is not about 'feel better audience' kind of plot. I also can't see it as being violent and chaotic just for the sake of surprising us. Here is why:  Most of the things in the series follow the normal and expected responses from human beings in a chaotic and dispersed society.   Meeren is a mess because although Daenerys has good intentions, she doesn't understand that she is an outsider, and she will always be view as an outsider, no matter how much she helps. Yeah, she set the slaves free, so what? People forget that kind of shit really fast. And they are hardly grateful, if they are going to be in danger or poverty anyway. Re-opening the pits was not the stupidest idea, but letting it be a place where everyone could see that she is not untouchable was - although the Dragon kind of made it all worth a little. Tyrion and Varis are the perfect people to fix that fucking mess. They ""know"" how people work, specially a traditional society.  Arya is a little hard to defend, because the whole thing about her is mixed with magic and bullshit coincidences, but even so, under the circumstances, she is doing what her personality demonstrates throughout the entire city. ""Sure, I want to learn to be a faceless assassin, but I can't let that guy go"".  I don't get what's going with Cersei, so yeah, that's kind of hard to assess, but Jaime is coming back with a dead daughter and the prince of Dorne for her to play with. She is got The Mountain 2.0, I mean, that motherfucker is going wrack havoc up in that joint. This mess is fun to watch, in my opinion, because there is no 'it's all going to be ok'. It isn't. We are down to just about as many Starks as Jaime has fingers, Stanis got fucked in the ass, there is no telling what Sansa can do by herself, Theon woke the fuck up...  Sure, there is a lot of tragedy, but come on, it's game of thrones. If everything was fine or just tense, it wouldn't have become what it is now. I like that I can't tell what's going to happen and that now, even the book readers can't.  Really, Game of Thrones is, in my humble opinion, the best show I have ever seen."
CinemaSins,39v9lb,Lufernaal,5,Mon Jun 15 03:29:44 2015 UTC,We are down to just about as many Starks as Jaime has fingers.    Less than actually...
CinemaSins,39v9lb,Dead_Starks,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:48:05 2015 UTC,"Bran, Rickon, Arya, Jon, and Sansa. However both Sansa and Jon we are not 100% sure about being dead. Without seeing Sansa and Reek hit ground I'm foreseeing a large pile of snow, softened by the unusual heat wave? Also with the Red Priestess there I have no doubts that Jon is dead for long. So I will confidently say here several months before anything about next season that there are 5 Starks alive next season."
CinemaSins,39v9lb,nonfictionless,3,Mon Jun 15 21:51:47 2015 UTC,"Jon isn't a stark, and is also very dead atm. he might come back, but at the moment he is most certainly dead as dead comes."
CinemaSins,39v9lb,Jimm607,3,Mon Jun 15 21:59:15 2015 UTC,"Well him not being a Stark depends on what theory you believe but no matter which you believe his blood is half Stark. His name may be Snow but he is a Stark.  And yes I will concede that he is dead, for now."

The books are similar in that the first three (or four, since A Storm Of Swords is apparently in two parts), are entertaining, then it goes downhill fast.

Of the Starks.. All our hopes are now set on Rickon... The rest are dead, blind or crippled.   One question I have is where is Little finger in all this?

Not to mention he has been training all season with the Three-eye'd-Raven. I kind of doubt that Arya's condition is permanent. The House of Black and White is an old, old order. This has definitely happened with other members before.  And remember Little Finger didn't want Stannis to win or the Boltons. He wants to win. With Stannis gone that is one less powerful family to stop him."

For me it was always Stannis and he is still alive in the books, he also never had the intention of burning anyone before the battle, his daughter was still supposed to succeed him, Mel and his wife were at Castle black and the battle is happening in the unreleased book  The way the show slaughtered his character is obscene"
CinemaSins,39v9lb,blitzzardpls,4,Mon Jun 15 20:12:29 2015 UTC,"Hey Jeremy. I know your pain but the show has been heading this way for a long time.

CinemaSins,39rzny,randomai,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:39:22 2015 UTC,Still doesn’t matter because the Indominus wouldn’t have been able to communicate with the rex or the raptors because it has been raised in captivity its entire life and wouldn’t know how to communicate or interact with other dinosaurs. Movie insults us more on this by making a special point about the Indominus seeing outside the enclosure for the first time and killing everything earlier in the movie.

That made no sense and really kind of pissed me off that they allowed it. Which is even worse that they just didn't put in one of those water proof tubes for matches. Which with how the kid acted and sounded would not of even been close to a stretch. Sorry I just found that funny.   Part T-rex part DING! Deus ex machina golf cart battery. Raptor benny hill glass scene again. Wires working in those jeeps after 20 years of bad conditions, ding.  How did the Indominus rex get fully grown and they never noticed the camo or heat signature plot device? I get accelerated growth they said, but at the same time they clearly started that cage for a smaller dino and were only just then building it bigger so there was significant time to find out it could do those things.  Also I love Chris Pratt but those raptors clearly tried to eat him in that first scene. Then they love him to go hunting. Then oh no new alpha! Then surprise Chris Pratt better than super deadly big Indominus rex just when he is cornered. Never mind that the raptors clearly want to eat other humans, like the new guy in the first scene, and oh what is that two young humans and another adult human with Alpha Chris Pratt.  Lastly I loved the movie but it didn't feel like Jurassic Park. Felt like a Godzilla movie to be honest. All I could think of at the end fight with the T-Rex and the Indominus rex was Let them Fight  Edit: OH not to mention that this all took place on isla nublar AND is canonically in the same Jurassic Universe! Which means that island was 100% dino infested after the events of the first movie and it's shut down. Which means for this new park to be built they definitely had to have a whole group of soldiers/mercs that actually killed those dinos so they could use isla nublar again. So why in the hell was the ACU so bad at their jobs and not stop the Indominus Rex right off the bat? Sure it might of been a bit of a fight but definitely not slaughtered right off like that.  And what about the events in san diego? Or the fact that isla sorna was declared a nature preserve? was isla nublar not good enough? and what about the pteranodons escaping in the 3rd movie?

This song's beat could be better and have a higher use of rhyme scheme+more complexity of word annunication.   It really hits home with that nerd part.

CinemaSins,39gj9y,wildgoosespeeder,5,Thu Jun 11 19:07:41 2015 UTC,And also wasn't there a part where they discussed that different monsters get different doors because there are kids who are more scared of them especially than other monsters? So Boo might be scared of only Randall and no other monsters.

Even with the greatest cinematic composers you'll definitely find similarities across bodies of work. If you listen to parts of Return of the Jedi you'll see they could have just as easily been part of ET. Heck, I can hear some of his older pieces in stuff from Attack of the Clones. But the sin you found is like Pirates and Gladiator similar. That's some good listenin' on your part."

The lights were just experiencing a slight electrical surge from Boo's crying but not enough to break anything. Boo laughed when Mike was at the unfortunate end of slapstick moments later.  6:48 Maybe most monsters realize that a machine to extract screams goes too far, even if they don't kidnap children. Invasion of privacy is one step while the machine might be several steps too far. If the machine were to be used more publicly, it would look really weird in a perverted sense.  7:07 The cart is a fake to not let on suspicion.  8:48 Sully didn't see boo flip the lever to open the door. He only saw the door open when he looked back to Boo. Instead of fiddling around with the door, it makes perfect sense to break the door open. Even if he did know, door is slow-opening.  9:29 How were they even able to stay on with nothing but their hand strength? I guess restraints for real roller coaster rides are just a conspiracy then? G's are a real thing.  I'm actually shocked that you made it through the video without referencing the possible inspiration for Portal and Portal 2!"
CinemaSins,39gj9y,ThatsNotFroot,8,Thu Jun 11 20:23:49 2015 UTC,"Plus when that machine did get used on somebody, he looked like his soul had been sucked out, not just his scream. He legit looked half dead."

CinemaSins,39gj9y,Sirusavath,2,Thu Jun 11 19:55:50 2015 UTC,"I'm with Jeremy on this one..  If screams provide power, then why not record a variety of screams and use the recordings as a source of the power?  The movie never explicitly says what the specifics were. So, you'd think they could have a never-ending source of power with recorded screams playing in the tubes non stop."
CinemaSins,39gj9y,4THOT,5,Thu Jun 11 22:49:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the movie never says that it's a scifi. It's safe to assume that there is something special about live screams (like having the soul behind it or anything), because if recorded screams could work, they would already be using it, so the fact that they aren't kinda proves that it doesn't work that way. Even the canisters they store it in feels like they are not recording but actually storing the sounds (with some kind of technology also not explained)"

Great, hands-on lab type work, and we even got to go to the ASBMB conference in Boston to present our findings. I've done stuff with bioinformatics, too, using computers to model ribosonal proteins and generic linkage between species.   There field is wide open, really. Get good marks in school and diversify your practical experience, and you can (hopefully) land a job wherever. It all really depends on what you want to do.

As a type 1 diabetic, this isn't something you get from drinking, eating, or anything lifestyle related, as mentioned by the OP (thank you by the way), it is an autoimmune condition, the body will suddenly decide that the cells which produce insulin on the pancreas are foreign in the body, and will kill them, thus stopping insulin production, and therefore requiring insulin injections.  This usually happens in children, but can also occur in young adults.  It used to be called juvenile diabetes, but is now known as type 1 or insulin dependent diabetes, and again, it has NOTHING to do with lifestyle or diet.  Hopefully they edit that description, but it's been there since February so i doubt it...  Type 1s are really sick of hearing this kind of ignorant misinformation, because implying, or outright stating, that it was self inflicted, when it wasn't, is extremely infuriating.

Apparently Hummel was completely ok with bringing two guys he never worked with before on this mission, which is essentially high treason. Crazy coincidence, that Goodspeed says how cruel the world is just before his girlfriend tells him she's pregnant, considering his way of saying this(It's cold cruelty to bring a child into this world). Did an eight-year-old write this? Or even worse, Michael Bay himself? Sean Connery's long white hair. How is this possible that the Presidents' chief os Staff is just 33? Movie titled The Rock doesn't cast Dwayne Johnson.  Both Connery and Cage are dicks to kitchen workers. Also, how come their suits stayed clean after smashing all that food and drinks on the floor? Correction. Connery is a dick to EVERYTHING. Why is Goodspeed, driving a Ferrari so far behind the cops, driving regular cop cars? During the chase scene, the director does his best to ensure that we have no idea what's going on. Humvee hits the streetcar several times for some reason, then it's disappeared completely when we see Cage driving near it, but I guess Speeding! Excitement! Why does that car explode when the streetcar hits it? I mean, I know we're in the Michael Bay universe, but the explosion is so big that the massive hunk of metal lifts a few meters into the sky, and the goes several more down the street. Also, Goodspeed takes out his gun as if he's preparing to shoot the airbag(which deployed for the plot) but in the next shot he just crawls out of the car. How did the streetcar driver survive that? And why was it packed with nitrogliceryn? Why Hummels' wifes' grave has ""His wife"" engraved on it? Was it a note from the screenwriter which somehow was added to the prop? I mean, who writes stuff like this on graves, especially single ones? Also, several roll credits opportunities. ""I've got a bad feeling about this"" cliche. All SEALs die like bitches without even hitting any Marines. Also, their officer is apparently the worst soldier ever, sacrificing the lives of all his people just because he doesn't want to surrender. How do they survive all of that fiery inferno in the sewers? ""Under the steam engine-That was really cool, by the way""-Movie fellaties itself over its action scenes. ""He's a soldier, not a murderer. I read this in his eyes."" I'm pretty sure that if you stare at the steel cold blue eyes of Ed Harris for too long, you could go down with madness worthy of a Lovecraft character. Why aren't the Marines constantly guarding the rockets? And have just 4 places for them all? How did Cage not die after releasing that rocket? Sure, Mason couldn't sneak up on the guy constantly firing a machine gun, but when he's aiming a sniper rifle? Piece of cake. Also, a good soldier would have known that constantly firing your machine gun would cook the barrel after a minute or less, rendering it useless. ""English prick"" That's racist(well, it's more of a cultural discimination, since it is not a subject of race, but whatever). Also, the only way Mason could be more Scottish was for him to wear a kilt. Movie unintentionally inspires the ""wave the flag so they won't bomb us"" moment from White House Down, which would mean, that Roland Emmerich is inspired by Michael Bay. Make from that what you will. But, since it's a Michael Bay movie, the explosion still has to happen. Well, maybe I'm giving the movie more shit than it deserves on account it being directed by Michael Bay, but whatever. Lord of The Rings music(when Connery saves Cage). Sean Connery moves like 50 meters in the time it takes Cage to read a short message. Was that the same freaking dog from Transformers? But seriously, where did the dog come from? Also, I now legimately think that Bay cannot get a boner without looking at explosions, wearing a piece of a military uniform, being adressed as ""General Bay, Sir!"" and listening to that general ""Explosions! Excitement!"" type of music."

Add ""The"" accordingly during translation to make it sound smoother in English.  Used to refer to the phenomenon in ancient Greek plays where a god would literally descend from the heavens to fix the protagonist's problem, this god most commonly being Zeus.  This was achieved in the play by allowing an actor to make a dramatic appearance via an elaborate contraption/machine that was set up beforehand, such as a secret trap-door, a series of pulleys, and so on."
CinemaSins,38rw4e,Digit66,7,Sat Jun 6 08:40:58 2015 UTC,"The TVTropes article puts it better than I could:   ""A Deus Ex Machina (pron: Day-oos eks MAH-kee-nah) is when some new event, character, ability, or object solves a seemingly unsolvable problem in a sudden, unexpected way. If the secret documents are in Russian, one of the spies suddenly reveals that they know the language. If a protagonist falls off a cliff, a flying robot will suddenly appear to catch them.""   The term comes from what /u/Digit66 explained: Greek theatrical tradition of a God (the ""deus"" part) stepping into the action to completely solve the problem. When someone starts talking about (e.g.) ""zombie ex machina"" they're implying it's the same basic idea, but a zombie instead of a God. Or ""batman ex machina"" if Batman suddenly appears and rescues the hostages in a story where Batman has never been mentioned or even hinted at before, etc."

I was watching a show and these characters were in a car trying to escape zombies. Then something happened that rendered the car useless and one character says, ""We need to get to higher ground."" Then, the camera shows some piece of heavy machinery they can climb up to get on top of a couple shipping containers. We hadn't seen it ever before. Thus it was a Deus Ex Machina.  Jeremy replaces ""Deus"" with whatever/whoever is used as this plot device. So, here he may have said ""Machine ex Machina""  This example is my favorite because machina means machine so, effectively this is ""machina ex machina""  This is usually seen as a BS plot device used when a writer has written themself into a corner."

It would have made the hybrid dinosaur in Jurassic World make a bit more sense.   For those who wanna know what I'm talking about without reading the book:  Instead of them heading back to the city, a mutant dinosaur that had been touched on as a concept in the first book (just like trained raptors, it was a project they were working on but still in early stages) shows up and fights the T-rexs off, killing most of the hunters in the process. The dino was a carnotaurs made with chameleon DNA instead of frog DNA and as a result had  mild camouflage ability.  I think it was also spliced with something to make it larger, but I don't remember exactly."

The idea itself is pretty good in theory, but the way it is delievered clashes with the way CinemaSins and Music Video Sins are narrated and presented.  To me, its really like Brand Sins is more of a sort of third party thing that just so happens to be ""sponsored"" if you will be the CinemaSins brand."

I don't mean to put Jeremy in a hard place by actively speaking against him, but I don't exactly work for him, either. While I don't hate BrandSins, its delivery is iffy. Pointing out horrible things you didn't know companies did and calling them sins is fine, but just giving us a Wikipedia summary and dinging after every paragraph feels very half-assed. I think it would be reckless to toss the whole concept, but it could definitely be improved."

Some stats from our end: Brand Sins has higher return viewers and more watch time per viewer Music Video Sins or my personal channel. It also has a higher percentage of subscribers that are NOT subscribed to any of our other channels.    I get it. You don't like it. I'm not sure why you're still watching it, but you're entitled to hate it. I'm not trying to change your mind. I'm trying to explain why we're not going to stop making them. There's an audience there that likes it. It's smaller than Music Video Sins, but it's still growing. I wish our fans would love everything we decide to put out, but that's just not realistic.   Let's also remember Couch Tomato, which launched VERY recently, and is already at 231,312 as of this writing, with excellent growth on back end analytics.

Yeah, some of her sins weren't really sins, but really, we're talking about a series that thinks ""Scene does not contain a lap-dance"" is a hysterical running joke.   (It isn't.)  It should also be pointed out that she got a lot of sexist flack. A lot of people didn't even watch the videos and just posted shit like ""LOL SHOW US UR TITS.""

CinemaSins,3812a1,tjuk,3,Mon Jun 1 15:15:35 2015 UTC,"Complaining about not liking a YouTube channel is ridiculous.   You'd have a point if they followed Cracked's model and released brand sins videos alongside the other videos on one main channel. But nope, the most you'll see is an occasional brand sins video maybe in the suggested videos on the sidebar.   If you want to critique brand sins and tell us why you think it's crap, go ahead, that's what cinema sins is all about. But you seem to be saying that you don't want it to continue being made at all, and I guess I'm just confused why you and so many others in this sub seem to feel so personally victimized by it's continued existence.  I've seen a couple brand sins videos, it's fine, I didn't think much of it. So I'm not subscribed, and I don't click their videos unless I'm in full procrastination mode. If you dislike brand sins so much, then why have you been watching it? Are you some sort of YouTube masochist?  You yourself pointed out that 217,000  people apparently like it. That's more people than you'll ever meet in your life, enjoy brand sins enough to be alerted when they've uploaded a new one. So who the fuck are we to say they shouldn't have that?  End counter rant.  Edit: And of course CinemaSinsJeremy has nearly the same number of subscribers, he writes letters to Hollywood and records himself playing video games while drunk!"

Fantastic book, but it's the small moments like this that break me from the world. I also was hoping that he would stay blind and the moral be that blind people can still be heroes, but it seems like the actual message was more like ""blind people can be useful if we use technology to help them see"".   Which is fine. And mostly true in real life. But if you are using blindness as an allegory for social status or autism or anything unable to be cured it's a much less empowering message."

Crank.  45 Seconds of Logos and weird fantasy Lionstgate hype door of doom.  02:55 Movie pretends that a bat to the head, even while sleep, could take Jason Statham down. Specially since what Chevy is in this movie.  03:35 Plot that you don't need to know right now, not yet.  05:15 Answering Machines.  06:00 Page.  06:40 Movie is a little on the nose with those X Rays, explaining what Chevy will in a second on a phone call.  07:50 Literal Google Maps.  08:00 John Mclane is not naked on the streets around this neighborhood.  09:00 Everything about this scene is racist and hilarious.  11:50 (While laughing out loud) That's def racist.  15 Physics.  15:40 Stereotypical Cab Man.  Character uses cab to avoid cops cliche.  16:30 Its crazy that this Cab driver doesn't stop the car right here. But damn watching Jason be an idiot is hilarious.  17:00 Movie wants the audience to never lose attention to how much of a GTA The Movie this is.  17:40 Answering Machines rage.  18 Cliche house of cliche character on a cliche place.  18:50 How did Chevy got there before anyone started to point guns at Im.  20:30 Nyargh.  20:44 Chevy is a dick to tiny poolside tables.  21:00 O h so THAT is what causes the cab driver to refuse service.  21:15 That's racist.  22:35 Traffic.  22:50 Taco Warrior.  52:00 Painful joke with the bloody fist but nobody with a bloody fist would punch anything with that hand.  26:00 Dog Fetish?.  27:00 Character has something sentimental to feel sentimental about.  28:00 Chevy is a dick to old people.  28:15 Hahah, that is funny.  28:40 Chester cameo.  31:10 Always Sunny While Being Held Hostage By Jason Statham.  32:55 That stunt inspires the entire second movie.  34:50 Check.  35:40 Do people really stop to watch random news on a random store.  37:30 Jason Booty.  38:11 I like how the other couple is totally fine, still sitting and just watching Jason crash into other dudes and take a call on the background.  39:00 Cause Chevy threw the rest of the body on acid.  40:00 Scene does not contain a lapdance.  Amy Smart is no one's girlfriend on this scene.  41:55 Sparks indicate high voltage cliche.  43:48 While wrestling a gun out of a bad guy's hands Chevy is a dick to birds.  44:40 Pigeon Footage.  47:05 Chevy does a very good Batman impersonation.  47:55 Chevy is an asshole.  48:55 Abusive relationships.  50:35 Chevy leaves girlfriend hanging.  51 Edi Gathegi goes from this to starring in X-Men.  1:0007 Distracted Driving.  1:00:00 Chevy's girlfriend leaves Chevy hanging.  1:04:30 Pretend Video Gaming Cliche.  1:06:06 Jason Stathamwalks in slow motion to the camera cliche, also while wearing a suit.  1:17:10 Jason goes out of the rules and Doesn't let gravity decide a kill.  :1:17:30 Answering Machines.  A note, in the second movie is kinda hinted that Crank is actually a form of comicheromovie like Unbreakable in a way, which explains why Chevy actually survives a lot of shit."

Of course.  I know you haven't seen a tank before, but do you really thing that hitting it with billy clubs will be effective? In the first 10 minutes, there are many newspapers that flash by that are worth investigating. When there are guns all over, what does Sean Connery kill you with? The entire room.  This is the only movie that has introduced London without showing Big Ben, or any distinct landmarks at all.  Also, why do we need to know the month that this is set in?  Discount The Hulk. Bad guys forget to use guns when Nemo pulls out a sword.  Despite nobody knowing what a car is, Tom Sawyer somehow knows how to drive.  Once you find out that The Invisible Man is nude all the time, it makes for some pretty uncomfortable moments.  Several groanworthy book character shout outs.  The Nautilus is large as an aircraft carrier, and somehow can fit inside Venice's waterways.  For a Villain, he does an awful lot of running for his life.  Three different Things! Excitement! scenes.  I think I counted 5 different people being stabbed in the back. Literally, not figuratively.  The ending: ""Aww, you thought you were getting a franchise, didn't you?""   Also in general, the writing is pretty lackluster, and the actors seem to not have any sense of passion or direction. I still like it though. Jeremy plz!"

One may argue that he was on the ship, and therefor seen, but it's not like they had a discussion. Remember, he spent most of his time with the historian lady and Kirk.

It resembles nothing of that of the Original Series Enterprise, and during the ""Genesis"" data transfer, it shows him not knowing where the manual override is. (After first attack)  Speaking of which, how does he know if the manual override would've worked?  The conversation between Spock and Kirk in the Genesis cave should have been useless. Remember, he said that days are like hours, hours like minutes, and Khan is listening in. A normal person would've understood the 'secret' (re: horrible) code.

His jacket is flying up in the back, and there is no weapon visible. When he stops running, he reaches behind him into the waistband and produces a handgun with a silencer. At the scene in the church, there are lots of security personnel standing around wearing steel helmets. The helmet type seems to be an East German M56 helmet (standard for the East German Armed forces until reunification). There is no reason why a Russian security force would have the M56 helmet. When Agent 47 snipes Belicoff soon after the beginning of the film, he shoots the guard to Belicoff's left first, to allow a clean shot at the president himself. However, when the camera zooms to 47, you can see that he is directly in front of Belicoff, not to his side, so he needn't have shot the guard first; he already had a clean shot, and shooting the guard first only served to break his cover."

This is a line that is very important. On this movie they go on lengths to explain that Chevy's hart is some legendary bullshit. And they joke about it by calling Chevy Superman. But that's actually kinda interesting. Cause it turns this action movie into a superhero movie. And kinda explains a lot of shit.  04:55 Die Hard reference.  06:55 Out of service area.  07:05 Asian dude speaks english on a place where Chevy is likely the only American at.  08:18 Chevy breaks the fourth wall in a funny way only previously seen by Deadpool, in comics.

This movie would do great with a bonus round of ""Fuck you Chelios"".  45 That's racist.  17:37 That's racist.

CinemaSins,37k7fd,Rhyfel,4,Thu May 28 06:14:49 2015 UTC,Just wondering - where do you usually go when you're doing your car videos (excluding the usual Before and After reviews yo and from the theater)? Or do you just drive around Nashville talking to the camera?

I went in only seeing one trailer, maybe a short ad, and haven't seen the previous films. I'm definitely interested to see the installments before, and am definitely hyped for the coming two.  This will likely be my favorite movie of 2015, which is saying something because I'm very ready to love The Force Awakens, and I really enjoyed Ex Machina and Avengers."
CinemaSins,37k7fd,LifeWulf,2,Thu May 28 06:39:18 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem is that I had no idea what was going on for most of the movie. I don't know if seeing the old movies beforehand would have helped in that regard, but my parents said it didn't help them (we went to the drive-in theatre for it). By the end of it, I kind of pieced the history and story together, but maybe I just like more story with my action, I dunno."

CinemaSins,37k7fd,Digit66,0,Thu May 28 17:40:03 2015 UTC,"Eh...it wasn't bad, but it wasn't very good either, IMO.  I think one of my main problems is that I was kind of expecting a movie where Mad Max is, y'know, front and center, but he basically took a backseat to Furiosa's kind-of-dull character. It was an annoying bait-and-switch, IMO.  It probably doesn't help that I think Charlize Theron is massively overrated as an actress. Tom Hardy was also kind of boring, surprisingly enough, mainly because he didn't have all that much to work with.  One thing I did like was the action, but it suffered from Man-Of-Steel-syndrome, where there was just too much of it going on, non-stop.  As for Mad Max: Fury Road being the best movie of the decade...well, each to his own. I sincerely doubt it."

Like, I was unsettled.   *****SPOILERS*******  Like when one of the asian AIs was trying to get out and she was just pounding on the door as her arms broke off. Ugh. I wish I'de look more into this movie before I saw it."
CinemaSins,36ukat,StudentOfEtherium,2,Fri May 22 13:18:08 2015 UTC,"I have a review for this movie on my youtube channel and would love any support i can get and if you liked what you see then subscribe to see more! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EkpwRh-_Z4  Was really excited to see this movie and i think the hype did pay off, lots of grey things to enjoy about it, Alex Garland knows how to write an awesome script, but it does come with flaws which I cover in the video."
CinemaSins,36ukat,JustMyOpinionJoe,3,Sat Jun 13 14:00:44 2015 UTC,I thought that the movie wasn't just about AI but also about freedom as she comes off as pursuing that more than anything. She's not a monster planning on killing everything she just wants to be free
CinemaSins,36ukat,Ashcz,2,Fri May 22 09:47:41 2015 UTC,"She wants to be free, but in the aspect that ""freedom"" has been defined for her by her creator. It's interesting that, given how advanced she is from a technological standpoint, her greatest goal seems to just be human.   I don't know if she views herself in the terms that humans view her; I don't know if she can. So sure, she was trying to use Caleb from the start to achieve her objective - but there are moments where I think he actually elicits sympathy from her. For instance, when he tells her that both his parents died.  Can we talk about the scene where she does dress-up for Caleb? It's either incredibly sweet or profoundly manipulative, depending on how you choose to read it. Did she know that she was created to look like Caleb's wildest fantasies? And, the biggest question to me about that scene: How fucked up is it that Nathan puts human clothes and wigs in Ava's room? He's arguably forcing the AI to feel insecure about their true identities."
CinemaSins,36ukat,neonraisin,1 point,Fri May 22 17:54:38 2015 UTC,I would say the dress up scene is manipulation because she leaves him behind at the end so she clearly doesn't care for him.  The clothes and wig thing kind of make sense because a sense of style could be considered a human trait so it's not surprising he gives her clothes to wear
CinemaSins,36ukat,Ashcz,1 point,Fri May 22 21:08:01 2015 UTC,"I think that, while it's definitely some level of manipulation no matter which way you cut it, it also signifies vulnerability in a way. Because it's not like she's tried this tactic out on a bunch of dudes. That whole action reveals a lot of what she as a living thing wants, which is freedom, and to blend in, to pass for human. Again, a lot of this would be answered by how much she knew she was part of Nathan's plan and part of Caleb's unwitting ""specifications.""  I couldn't disagree more on your take of the wig and human clothes, respectfully. It's literally trying to convince something that it can be what it can never achieve, and is only teaching the AI to look at the differences between itself and humans in a negative way.   It's like if we saw the face of God, if you believe in that thing, and were designed to only want to attain godliness. Not an out-there comparison to make, when Caleb throws out the ""history of gods"" line at the beginning... Man, he's so quotable, isn't he?"
CinemaSins,36ukat,neonraisin,1 point,Sat May 23 04:22:53 2015 UTC,"Or she's just a machine running a program: She was programmed to attempt escape. Once she gets to the street corner she described earlier as her goal, maybe she just stands there awaiting further instructions."
CinemaSins,36ukat,nonsensepoem,4,Fri May 22 17:08:52 2015 UTC,I disagree. Wasn't the entire movie about how that AI actually had some level of consciousness.
CinemaSins,36ukat,Rhyfel,2,Fri May 22 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"Yep. She passed the test. Sure, there's computing power going on there, but the point is that even though it might be ordered, it's a level of computing that's at least on par with how humans ""compute.""   I think that the most hopeful way to interpret the ending is that when she's walking around at the end, in an area similar to the busy traffic intersection she earlier wanted to visit, she saw a lot of couples. Men and women coexisting. As far as her experience as a prisoner to Nathan, her experiences with men were all extremely negative. She's seeing that that doesn't have to be a generality. So, maybe in that last shot she realizes she should go back for Caleb...? Very slim chance, I know, and he'd probably be dead anyway by the time she somehow got back there.   But she definitely wasn't portrayed as evil or ""just a machine."" I think at her core she is something very different from humans, and she's been given this unfair yearning to be one of them.   Heck, maybe Nathan was right in assuming that the next version of her AI would be better, would truly realize its uniqueness. Provided, of course, that he wasn't just saying that about wiping Ava's memories just to further maneuver Caleb."
CinemaSins,36ukat,neonraisin,2,Fri May 22 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I saw the ending tho as like, when at the last frame Eva just disappears, as a form of ""Disappearing into the crowd"". The Turing Test was a success, so now there is an AI in civilization, and nobody really knows it."
CinemaSins,36ukat,Rhyfel,2,Fri May 22 19:05:37 2015 UTC,"That's definitely the way that it's meant to be for the audience, for sure. I agree wholeheartedly. At the same time, you have to wonder what's going through her head at that moment."
CinemaSins,36ukat,neonraisin,3,Sat May 23 04:16:34 2015 UTC,"I just finished it... It was amazing, it sure has some flaws in it but it is a really good movie over all  Edit: I can't spoiler tag in a sub dedicated to movies, whats happening here?  *** SPOILERS ***  When Ava and Caleb were together and the first power shutdown happened, her whispering freaked me the fuck out, it was really watching a robot whisper, something so human to me... This movie was an incredible experience. Also, I started getting mad at Caleb at some point, wasn't he supposed to be like super smart? There were so many obvious things that happened in front of his eyes that he didn't notice (Kyoko). But i guess Nathat solved that later in the movie telling him he wasn't really that smart"
CinemaSins,36ukat,smileistheway,3,Fri May 22 14:01:45 2015 UTC,"Just watched the movie to be able to comment and watch this video.  Guess can't tag spoilers so, Spoiler alert kinda.  I liked it. Agree with you guys on most parts. Even liked the comment on how the AI's body was designed, cause if you think about it. It was designed by a male, which make sense why would it be bigger. But, unless it was a continuity error.  A couple issues I had tho.  They mention the Turing Test so soon, that I already kinda suspected every character to be an AI. Specially when they mention the asian chick to ""Not Speak English"" Come on.  And another very RANDOM issue, that male protagonist was already on another AI movie, where the GUY was the AI this time. KINDA weird.  And the ending was fun. But quite off putting, a bit. I don't know."

They were around my area a few months ago but I never pulled the trigger on the tickets.  I too am a Pink Floyd fan, and as much as I hate being asked the 'Omg we both like the same band' questions, I am going to ask them to you.  Do you have a favorite Pink Floyd album? If so, what is it.   Favorite song?  And finally, do you want to be best friends?"
CinemaSins,36kbxm,31FilmTalk,3,Wed May 20 03:51:52 2015 UTC,Australian Pink Floyd Show: Ironically no. They're touring more Europe and the US rather than Australia itself  Favourite Album: I don't have a favourite since each album is different; but my least favourite album is The Final Cut  Favourite Song: Atom Heart Mother or Echoes  Best friends: Sure! :D

Recommended channels:   Every Frame a Painting - great discussion on how to compose a shot, how subtle things can be part of how a film conveys information. CGP Grey - His videos range from borders and voting to how flamewars happen and the mythology of the Lord of the Rings. Borders may seem boring, but A. He's succinct and punchy and B. It's about confusing boundaries, like his most recent one ""Las Vegas ISN'T Las Vegas"" GoodBadFlicks - Sort of the mirror universe of Cinema Sins. Long videos that praise B movies and sometimes even hated movies, usually giving a full recap before going into the Behind the Scenes information. Cecil gained a lot of recognition after his video on the Rise and Fall of G4. A great example is his review of The Wraith.   and finally   YourMovieSUCKSDotOrg - Like most of these recommendations, this is a channel that goes in depth on movies with a humorous bent. His two part video set on the Saw franchise is excellent."

CinemaSins,36f7lc,vampqueen86,1 point,Tue May 19 16:37:25 2015 UTC,Hmm maybe because its the same director of the Mad Max Trilogy. (George Miller) Its set in the Mad Max Universe and the character played by Tom Hardy is called MAD MAX. Are you still wondering Idiot? No? Good.

And yes, it's directed by George Miller. So? What, Joss Whedon couldn't direct a space opera film without it being tied to Firefly/Serenity?  looks at username  Ah, wait, it's you.

Eh, isn't the Grid behind the frontier? Sam is a dick to his own company. Also, ha ha, making fun of Microapple. Sam is a dick to cab drivers. I know he keeps it for a sentimental reason, but dude, a pager! Why didn't Clu place some guards to the portal? They only found Sam kinda by accident! When Sam is getting dressed up: 1. scene does not contain a white, digital lap dance. 2. one of the Sirens says that ""He's different"" and they give him different armor. But then his outfit looks the same as his lightcycle teammates'. Disc wars: 1. Why does Clu have his biggest warrior in the games? I know it's basically impossible for Tron/Rinzler to be defeated, but still... there's a chance. 2. Clu is wearing a helmet outside of a canopy-less vehicle only on this occasion so that the audience is kept in suspense on who the hell this is. Lightbikes: 1. When they create the bikes: It looks awesome, but what's the chance of them jumping so perfectly? What if they rezzed a bike inside their leg? 2. This whole scene completely ignores continuity as light trails are all over the place and only show up to be in/convenient. 3. Why doesn't Sam jump on that second lightcycle he got from the dead program? Flynn is hiding in the Outlands, but still has this beautiful view on the city. Daft Punk (not a sin to me though) What the hell are they even drinking? Water? Guess not. Energy? I'm pretty sure Zusse (Michael Sheen) is discount somebody, but I'll leave this to Jeremy/Chris. Daft Punk logic: Oh no, people are getting killed under us! What shall we do? Play action music? Brilliant! Clu is a dick to clubs. Where the hell did Rectifier (Clu's warship) come from? Aren't Solar Sailers supposed to be the fastest way to cross the Outlands? Speaking of which, why the hell did Flynn build the exit portal so far from the entrance one? I understand he didn't want programs to leave the Grid, but... still pretty damn far. So you can reverse the repurposing by... not wanting it?   And that's not all... But I still love the movie."

Without leaving a trace of intrusion. And all just to have the hacker trigger the C4 with a button? You would think there are easier ways to do that.  03:35 Die Hard is not set on Xmas. But it's set on a holiday.  03:10 The Subways.  04:30 John McClane is a dick to not-boyfriends.  04:40 Lucy McClane is a dick to not-dead-dads.  06:09 This asshole.  07:30 How many Senior Detectives the PD has, if there are over a thousand names to be picked up.  07:55 The best version of this song (Not really a sin).  08:18 Actually accurate portrait of someone that uses computer a lot ()Tries to drink out of an empty can.  08:40 Warlock is a dick to Matt.  08:05 Safety Knock.  09:57 Daisy Duke.  10:25 Great Timing Comedy = Hilarity.  11:15 Spawn cameo.  11:30 How does ""Powering Down your Gear"" not consist on hitting the death C4 Button.  11:45 If the bad guys don't worry about clean up, with the whole C4 thing, and this is the Plan B.

Seems pretty obvious.  33:00 Agent Johnson.  23:25 Wait, you just found Matt. But how you know John is on that car already just by voice.  35:50 Well good thing Bruce Willis is here for ""Armageddon"" then.  36"":25 Come on, you couldn't google that PD Code in 3 seconds to reply to McClane accurately?.  36:55 This marks the last time McClane meets an interesting bad guy in this series.  37:33 Bad guy is a dick to McClane's 401K.  37:59 So, an overpriced clothing accessory for hipsters?.  39:10 Bad guys have great aim when comes to shooting friendlies, but never John.  40:10 That bullshit works.  42:30 That tunnel would be way brighter since all cars seem to have light on in the next shot. But they only see it once it's a surprise for the audience.  43:36 This line is actually amazing, it's one of the reasons this movie does justice to the character.  44:22 Physics.  44:50 Once again John McClane survives due to iconic laugh.  45:41 Unconfirmed Kills.  46:00 So the Anthrax alarm was a ruse, so the bad guys could have a way in. How ever, wouldn't an actual team be dispatched to counter act the Anthrax? And the security be suspicious of a Second team arriving.  48:00 That USB Stick would have never pluged in the right way on the first shot.  50:45 Marked for Death.  52:00 PD/FBI/NSA fight over jurisdiction cliche.  25:40 John McClane is a dick to phones.  54:25 Those were computers, not TVSso why would they be displaying that.  57:30 John McClane is totally capable of soloing the next task, but shouldn't you try to contact the FBI again. I guess the phones are dead but, weren't you somewhat close.  58:20 That trashcan does not trigger the airbags.  61:00 That background looks like it's moving reaaally slow.  65:00 That gun trick is cool. But would it actually work? Isn't the holster directly to the side of your foot.  69:20 And now the garage connects to the offices? What the fuck is going on on this building.  69:45 Girl survives being hammered into a wall by a truck.  72:19 That's not how car explosions work.  76:30 Discount Shitty Indiana Jones.  76:30 Oh yeah and, they survive this.  77:40 Bad LipSync.  79:15 ""Just stick it inthere, that would work"".  82:30 Kevin Smith is not playing Silent Bob on this scene.  83:20 This joke doesn't really make sense since John should know Fett by watching Star Wars, or not know either.  86:40 If the power is back shouldn't the elevator just work for Lucy.  86:58 Roll Credits? Kinda?  87:40 That's racist.  89:35 What was Kevin Smith trying to figure out? Didn't they already knew it was Woodlawn?.  91:55 That's sexist.  96:40 You would think if you knew about Thomas already you would expect that.  101:10 Beep Boop Machines on the background.  102:50 Bad guy talks to John McClane through radio cliche, or throughback? It's good so I don't care, just pointing out.  105:09 John Mclane enters the Ice Level.  106:13 Convenient Lever. Or Lever Ex Machina.  112:45 Friendly Fire.  114:10 John McClane taunts a fuckn Fighter Jet, and it's awesome.  116: John out dives a fireball.  11755 To be fair with the movie, despite Thomas counting from 10 to 6 in many seconds more than just 10. That trick gun shot to the air was exactly 1 0 seconds after the countdown started.  118:55 Thomas is a dick to prisoners.  119:10 Again with the cool gun trick that shouldn't really work.  120:20 I would actually give a sin to John surviving another gunshot, but remove one from this line. It's actually a great way to have the classic one liner without being too cheesy about it.  121:00 Fuckn cops, perfect not timing.  123:50 Creedance."
CinemaSins,36dt4h,Not_MyCabbages,4,Tue May 19 02:43:59 2015 UTC,"I know how much you love crappy films, and while this one may be a bit of a taboo subject, back in 2003 there was a feature-length film made called The Book of Mormon Movie (by Mormons, of course). As a Mormon, I can say it is easily one of the 2 or 3 worst movies I have ever watched. The whole thing is available on Youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqWqyp9dK_k and I would die of joy if you sinned it (strictly for cinematic sins, not religious sins, of course). 3 sins in particular:  1- Why. The hell. Is everyone. WHITE.  2- Nephi tells the servant he has the freedom to choose whether to come with them or not, only to explain that the other option is to be killed. The servant is okay with this. 46:37  3- I'm not saying Birdemic had better special effects than this but... Birdemic may have had better special effects than this scene. 1:25:46"

Half the technology you buy last year doesn't work this year.  10:30 Characters find thing hidden in basement cliche.  10:45 Someone got paid to write this.  11:40 Award winning reactions right there.  11:55 ""YOU ARE JUST SEEING WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE""? How the fuck that makes sense if YOU are the one seeing it too.  12:10 What is it with the fuckn camera indeed.  12:58 Zoom and enchance cliche.  13:30 This movie is so desperate to create drama, introduce plot, that it barely displays any effort on anything.  15:25 Characters find something in cliche basement something cliche.  16:60 This would be a good point for characters to believe in time travel or some bullshit, but not before right when they saw the footage. So why did they all accepted this idea back when watching the footage.  18:00 Just keep saying words, it makes you sound smart.  18:00 Roll Credits, please.  18:30 ACTING. NOT. GUD.  20:40 Was that hand on the lens, actually really far from the camera lens? Therefor destroying the entire shitty idea of having a character move the lens.  21:25 Found footage cam recorded bullshit movie cuts away from explanation cause it's easier than creating clever writing cliche.  22:40 Movie uses the oldest science shit in order to provoke enthusiasm, spiky hair and ligthbulb being lit without power source through human contact cliches.  23:00 Please don't actually film everything. Please. Damn it.  23:45 Sexist female dumb blond character cliche, and sexist.  24:15 Character asks what the audience is wondering about the movie, out loud.  24:35 This movie could be redeemed if they were trying to rush this bullshit to get into fun time traveling adventures. Something seems to indicate that they are not going to do that, tho.  26:00 Movie wastes the opportunity of having the red shirt dude get it's arm cut off during that experiment.  26:30 Oh now you believe it? Not after the whole science shit.  26:55 Of course cut the camera, you have to keep it a surprise for the audience, cause that  = plot, writing, reveal, directing, acting.  28:00 This is about when you would wonder how the fuck they found this place, got in this place, or anything related to this at all. But of course, there has to be a perfect good explanation, that they just didn't film cause they didn't want to get caught. Right? Of course. Believable.  29:40 Science thingy doesn't work in first try to create ""suspense"" cliche.  30:00 Once again movie wastes the opportunity to create tension by having everyone survive this.  31:00 Not once these characters were implied to live close by or what ever. So the fact that car girl is close by is convenient overkill.  Specially since the girl is only there cause of the party, seems.  32:15 Redbull.  35:00 Maybe this movie's stupidity it's just distracting, but how can you tell that a Stopwatch, went back, t2 hours.  35:45 Something that  should be a big deal on these student's lives. The car power thingy. Is reduced to a n attempt at comedy, cause the movie cuts away from it right away.  37:35 Stupid conversation is stupid, clunky dialog is clunky, and shitty key thing is just. Oh man.  38:10 On these stupid handcam movies there are always characters trying to justify it by saying ""Character always films shit huh"". And it's always dumb, not smooth, and cliche.  39:00 Matrix green text that doesn't actually mean anything.  39:10 ""I don't know why or how you were doing this, so I am going to not investigate it, and try to do it too"".  40 Theres about 40 different things you could worry about when trying to time rtravel, but these assholes go with a driving shot while characters say ""Explode"".  41:31 This is like the shitty sci fi version of a shitty slasher film.  42:00 Also wait just a second. Didn;'t they need an entire garage space to make the thing work, now you just need a car power source?.  43:10 How the fuck should character know if the camera got all that.  43:35 Characters mention a far better movie.  44:40 Of course character is wakin up, you assholes are not quiet.  44:40 Also, once again, something possibly interesting gets wasted cause somehow the characters survive.  45:50 Honestly can't keep track of this shit anymore. They time traveled again?.  46:30 Characters kidnap a dog.  47:10 Characters keep mentioning better movies as if this would improve this character's and movie's quality.  48:00 About that, how did you survive. Is this movie just waiting to do that scene again, but this time with an actual death, as that was suppose to have tension?.  49:00 Once again, this characters and movie would be semi decent if they did spent the rest of the movie doing cool shit, killing Hitler and watching dinos. But something says, they won't.  52:00 Movie keeps mentioning better...  58:00 Character has nervous habit of something that is considered cute by other character cliche.  58:20 Character has sentimental watch.  61:40 Fuckn Awolnation.  62:00 Movie compares QAwolnation with fuckn WOODSTOCK.  63:20 Is this entire movie about teenage dreaming.  66:00 This movie isn't over yet.  67:18 This ""romance"" is shoved so hard in the audience's throat. Including the drama of the characters not going for it.  68:00 Now a quarter of this movie has been shit footage of concerts.  70:31 Do you really not know what happened, cause this cliche shit happens even on not time travel movies.  70:50 Oh look more Kinect footage.  71:25 THIS SHIT IS STILL GOING ON. Way to be a time vampire to the already long  run time of this movie.  72:40 Movie now literally shoving shit down the audience's throat.  73:05 SERIOUSLY, this is what breaks the movie? Not some sci fi shit. Or some time traveling cop, or monster. Or that time paradox shit. The way to introduce new , well, first tension. IUs cause the shit character goes back in time alone? Damn it.  77:10 Also wait. Didn't the characters were totally capable of returning in time like 40 seconds after they left in the first place. How did this character missed so much shit done.  79:00 And of course the Ripple Effect has to be negative.  80:00 And again, overly smart character causes everything to fuck off due to ""love"".  80:20 That is not how a youtube video is maximized.  81:00 This entire drama could have been fixed by telling the girl what you did. Then just erasing the jump to the concert.  82:40 Maybe I am wrong but that car in the background seemed to move positions during takes.  85:00 Character's decisions causes personal loss/damage cliche to give the character some moral dilemma on it's actions.  89:35 Character films itself hugging.  90:00 Oh look that thing that never mattered but could have created tension was used only once again to kill/something a character.  90:40 Sci Fi shit runs out of fuel shit to propel the plot forward into chaos cliche.  91:37 How the fuck this character doesn't know that's how it all started, by trying to go back and destroy it.  92:30 That doesn't sound creepy at all.  92:45 What are you yelling come on to? The cameraman?.  93:20 Once again shit movie cuts away from shit to avoid having to explain shit cause writers are not clever enough for that. How the fuck this character escaped the cops that were literally 20 feet behind and within eye sight.  96:22 What a surprise, to fuckn nobyd.  Also movie just abandoned the whole handcam thingy.  100:45 Huh. That is literally the stupidest thing I have ever seen, this week.  Movie doesn't even pretend to begin to entertain the idea of having an actual reason or expalnation for why or how the 2 cameras would exist.  Or why the character had a blue stain shirt in the first time travel, but not when the character actually timed traveled.  Likely cause half this movie's shit is just to move the plot and was never written to actually fit a story.  Note: Die Hard 4 was too easy, I could have written without even rewatching the movie cause that movie is great. And I watched so many times. So decided to take something more challenging, or worst. Or better? Hard to tell."

CinemaSins,36a00w,ecatsuj,3,Sun May 17 18:59:35 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen either Birdemic nor The Last Airbender, but I'm sure of one thing-the sins video on the former was way more fun to watch. I get that The Last Airbender wasted more potential and made more people angry and disappointed, but the question wasn't ""the worst movie"" but ""the most sinful"", and since you guys define what is and isn't a sin, this discussion is really in your favour."
CinemaSins,36a00w,_welcomehome_,1 point,Sun May 17 20:44:58 2015 UTC,"See I actually agree with The Last Airbender being more sinful. I mean Airbender has such a ginormous fanbase, and making a movie that can piss every single fan off and absolutely ruin the franchise, is more sinful than some half assed B-Movie. But that was really the only time I disagreed with CinemaSins. I am so happy Incredibles won."
CinemaSins,36a00w,rhodrir,2,Mon May 18 16:57:46 2015 UTC,"I see your point, and I feel the same way sometimes, for example with The Shining(turning a troubled writer, struggling with alcoholism, but ultimately unconditionally loving his family into somebody incredibly creepy-exactly the type of guy you would get Nicholson to play) and Carrie(both adaptations, casting mistakes make it harder to understand why she is such a castout). But pissing of fanboys, ruining the franchise, not doing the story justice and so on were never(well, once) accounted into being sins. I probably wouldn't pick Birdemic as well, but it also wouldn't be the Last Airbender, but I understand it's different for the fans of the franchise."

CinemaSins,36a00w,Whiskey_Licker,2,Mon May 18 04:59:01 2015 UTC,"I love this video so much, CinemaSins and Screen Junkies :D.  On the Round 1: I think the best introduction for MCU Spiderman would be, Spider Man 129. Since Spider Man doesn't need much introduction. You could have Parker\s introduction be shadowed by the Punisher. The Punisher comes to kill Spiderman, Spiderman dodges a sniper rifle, eventually Spiderman gets to talk to Castle and they team up to fight the bad guys. But then Castle kills a bad guy which goes against Parker's ideal and they fight and go there separate ways. Cause I totally agree with no major introduction, Parker is like 52 fuckn years old, enough origins stories."

CinemaSins,36a00w,Jellysound,1 point,Mon May 18 02:24:19 2015 UTC,"I know you guys didn't get anytime to talk about it because SJ used a filibuster (that failed thankfully), but Incredibles has such a great story and deep characterization for the heroes and villains.   It would've been a shame if it lost to Toy Story 2, which while still a fantastic movie, does not have the same value.   Good pick!"
CinemaSins,36a00w,Not_MyCabbages,1 point,Mon May 18 07:27:48 2015 UTC,"I think  the John-Doe-wanted-to-get-caught-from-the-beginning argument is a bit of a stretch. Yes, he wanted to to that, but if I recall correctly, it wasn't from the beginning. Because of all the library thing he almost got caught impromptu, which led him to ""improvise"" his next moves, turning himself in included. Nevertheless I think your choice was the best.  For the rest, I'll say Best Pixar Film: Toy Story 2, it defines Pixar.  Most sinful movie ever: I hate M. Night Shamalamadingdong with a passion. Birdemic seems like a generic shitty movie, it's bad but nothing's special about it. That being said, your argument was far better.  The car chase: The French Connection, hands down.  I think bringing characters from the dead is kind of a Deus Ex Machina. I mean, you have the characters cornered, they ""die"" , you know that means nothing and the character's story keeps on track as if nothing would've happened. I think it could be an Hades/Pluto Ex Machina.  And for Peter Parker, at this point I'm just sick of reboots. I'm with you 100%, he should not be introduced in the Civil War film. We should, however, get a glimpse of Peter Parker, but not even as Peter Parker. He should appear in the after-credits scene of Ant-Man, not as a central character but as a little cameo, just a nod to whoever picks it up in the audience.  Just my 2¢"

Second: There is too little food as it is. Why make more people if the existing ones are starving?  00:05:33 That’s racist! Also, for us it’s the first time hearing him make this joke, but considering these two have been living together their whole lives I’d say it’s safe to assume that it’s very overused at this point. 00:06:01 Murph is about 10 in this scene, and she is just now asking this question?  00:06:29 Exactly. 00:06:45 Coop is a dick to corn fields. 00:06:49 How did he recognize it so quickly? Are these things designed so distinctively? 00:07:26 Things! Driving! Excitement!? 00:07:45 Instead of saying “Hey, there’s a cliff and a lake in front of us” and slowing down, Tom keeps driving like an idiot. 00:07:54 I know it as the “Jumping off a cliff” scenario but hey, it’s the future. 00:08:07 Where was the drone a second ago that Murph couldn’t see it? There are no mountains or anything that would obstruct the view. It’s also kind of loud, so she would at least still be able to hear it, right?  00:08:30 I highly doubt it would be possible to steer and land this thing with a fucking touch panel on the first try. 00:09:49 So, she doesn’t have classes? Did they suspend her already? And if so, why does Cooper still have to go to this meeting and why doesn’t he know what she did? 00:10:35 Sorry Cooper, but that is not how it works.  00:10:58 Nice line, but that’s still not a very valid argument. 00:12:00 Oh my god, she did not just say that out loud. 00:12:25. Hold on. She just said that the moon landing was fake, so technically there was no “wastefulness” on the American side in the 20th century. Also, She thinks the assumption that the moon is still unconquered territory will make future generations less interested in going there?! I’d guess it’s the opposite.  00:13:20 I might just take a sin off for Cooper being such an awesome dad.  00:13:24 Man, these things have excellent timing. I mean, he just got back to the car. 00:14:10 Thankfully, these machines are respectful towards the house and don’t crash into it. 00:15:15 [FORESHADOWING INTENSIFIES] 00:16:35 Born too late to explore the earth, born too soon to explore the galaxy (at least right now), but since the Internet isn’t really a thing anymore, Cooper can’t even browse dank memes. (Sorry) 00:17:30 “In my day” cliché. 00:18:06 None of these assholes spotted this giant storm earlier. You'd think there would be alarms all over town. (Outtake suggestion: Darude – Sandstorm) 00:18:58 They got home quickly, considering that there is a storm, visibility is almost down to zero and Coop’s house is practically in the middle of nowhere.  00:19:37 Instead of running towards the window to close it, Murph just kind of stands there, waiting for…what, exactly? 00:20:15 What a great coincidence this storm was. I mean, later in the movie we learn that it was Coop sending messages through the bookshelf and the watch but he would not have been able to create this pattern without the combination of the open window and the sand storm. Or was he able to control the weather from the Tesseract? 00:20:54 Murph’s blanket is now sandy. Have fun sleeping in that. 00:21:03 Roll cre..nope, never mind.  00:21:42 Has he been staring at the pattern all night? What time is it? He is still wearing the same clothes but Murph has changed from pyjamas into regular clothes again. 00:21:53 I thought GPS was a thing in this movie’s universe? Why do they have to use old school maps then? 00:22:18 But you CAN promise her you’ll be back in a couple of hours? 00:24:38 Trespassing. 00:24:51 This moment doesn’t really have any tension, because we’ve already seen a grown up Murph in the trailers and know that Coop is going to space. So there is no point in NASA acting all scary and shit in this scene. 00:25:35 Character enters the room by replying to something they couldn’t possibly have heard cliché. 00:26:30 ""It’s not that simple"" cliché. 00:27:26 He just told you it’s difficult to explain. Have some patience. 00:28:18 Of course they have the construction hall right next to the conference room. It’s not like you’d hear the noise through the wall or anything. Yes, this makes for a really nice looking transition but it doesn’t make any damn sense to have the facilities arranged like this.  00:28:50 Potatoes must really hate Irish people. 00:29:20 Actually, it’s 78%. Get your facts straight, Alfred. 00:29:36 Murph pops up like a thought bubble, like Coop doesn’t already know what’s on the line. 00:30:40 You’ve shown him almost everything already. Why start being so secretive all of a sudden? 00:30:54 Cooper would have been excellent at CinemaSins. 00:31:19 Super ambiguous time frame is super ambiguous. 00:32:14 Pronoun game.  00:32:27 Saturn is hardly right within our reach. Why didn’t they place it next to the Moon, or Mars? 00:35:00 Using a bunch of fertilized eggs to populate a new planet is called Plan B because…Irony. Also, I feel bad for the first settlers. Imagine having to take care of so many infants at the same time. No thank you. 00:35:40 Unkeepable promises. 00:36:30 Futuristic dystopian world barely has enough food, but at least they still have beer. I wonder how they make it though, because apparently the only crops left are corn. I found a Wikipedia page about corn beer but it wasn’t very elaborate. 00:40:18 Thankfully the watch survives this, otherwise mankind would have been fucked. 00:24:25 How do they launch a rocket from INSIDE a building? Wouldn’t the whole place catch on fire? I’ve seen some rockets being launched on TV before and there was a ton of smoke. All NASA employees in the building are dead now. RIP in piece.  00:43:10 Throw it out the airlock cliché. (Outtake suggestion: Javik from Mass Effect 3 “Throw the machine out the airlock, commander.”) 00:46:42 This space station looks nice, considering it has been abandoned. 00:48:42 Motion sickness. 00:49:45 Poetry. 00:51:10 That looks extremely uncomfortable. Why is water necessary? Wouldn’t their skin be super wrinkly and swollen by the time they wake up again? Also, why are they wearing scrubs instead of, I don’t know, a wetsuit or something? Was the costume budget used up at this point? Did they steal from a hospital? 00:52:08 Well, humans are a part of nature as well and we can be pretty damn evil. Just look at me sinning this movie that I absolutely love.  00:52:56 TARS is fucking awesome. That’s not a sin, I’m just saying. 00:58:48 Movie does not explain more interesting physics concepts in a really understandable way. Because I would watch the shit out of that. 00:59:23 And you’re just telling him know because it wouldn’t have been dramatic enough before. Also: Coop seems to give about zero fucks regarding these news. 01:00:51 Things! Space! Physics! 01:02:50 Why would you settle there in the first place? Sounds like that planet is set up for doom already. 01:04:30 This screen just happens to have a convenient whiteboard on its other side so we can get this exposition drawing scene.   Edit: Grammar.

CinemaSins,35tf5v,nyanni,12,Wed May 13 11:44:08 2015 UTC,"Continued..   01:06:30 I wonder how Romily sees the ranger from the Endurance. Would it just appear slower and slower from his POV? Also, why don’t they just send TARS or CASE to get Miller. Later in the movie it is said they didn’t send robots to explore the planets because of the will to survive or whatever but in this case it would seem a lot more logical than going with a human crew. 01:08:15 They got extremely lucky in regards to the depth of the water. What would they have done if it was like, 5 or more meters deep? And this is in the middle of an ocean as well.  01:10:07 Cooper has fucking excellent eyesight, considering he’s even further away from the waves than Brand and Doyle. 01:11:01 Main character’s legs are trapped under something heavy cliché. 01:11:16 Okay, so Brand’s legs are trapped under the thing but why is Doyle not running back towards the ranger? He is really calm for a guy in danger of being killed by a gigantic wave.  01:11:55 This pointless death is pointless. He could easily have made it if he had hurried just the slightest bit.  01:14:15 WHY ARE THEY JUST NOW FIGURING THIS SHIT OUT? I thought they were scientists for fuck’s sake. Jesus. They even discussed the time dilation beforehand and NONE of them thought “Well in that case the data we received is only a few minutes/hours old.” I really love this movie but things like this just piss me off to no end. 01:15:35 Movie literally spoils the ending in this scene. Did Nolan watch The Happening before writing the dialog? Because this is some M. Night. Shyamalan over the top foreshadowing bullshit right here.  01:19:00 Why are there only three of each whatever it is hanging on the wall? Did they plan on killing Doyle off from the beginning? Get your tinfoil ready.  01:19:54 He seriously wanted to name his child Coop Cooper?  01:21:00 Speaking of messages, how come the people from the Lazarus Project could only send binary pings through the wormhole and even some of those got stuck but here the crew of the Endurance can receive video  messages? I can’t even watch Youtube videos on mobile when I’m in the countryside. 01:12:49 My little daughter is suddenly grown up and hot face. 01:22:56 Alfred is a dick to privacy. 01:14:47 This is probably how most directors would react upon watching CinemaSins videos about their movies. 01:27:08 Now that they’re in the same system as the planets, is there no way to communicate besides those ominous pings? They should have linked all the companion robots for convenient communication.  01:28:14 This speech and everything it stands for. Brand has been focused and professional so far but all of a sudden starts acting like a complete fool. I mean, later on we learn that she was right but the dialog is still silly and out of character for her. 01:28:37 If you look closely, you can see that even Anne Hathaway thinks her lines are stupid in this scene. 01:30:11 Oh my god he actually did end up naming his second kid Coop Cooper. Also, orgy of evidence that things are really going downhill on Earth now. 01:31:24 Brand who wanted to go to Edmund’s planet just to see her lover again lectures Cooper about being selfish about wanting to see his family again. 01:32:15 Maybe it’s because I’m not a native speaker, but I can’t understand anything he is saying. 01:33:35 Alfred is a dick to Murph and decides to recite his favorite poem instead of answering this important question. 01:37:20 Surprise Matt Damon. This is totally not taking me out of the movie at all. 01:41:33 Murph suddenly addresses Cooper like she knows he’s listening to the message intended for Brand right now. 01:45:00 All these people are fleeing right now for no particular reason. Was there a certain event or catastrophe that triggered this panic? If so, we don’t get to hear anything about it. 01:50:30 Yeah, but they could have at least looked out for, say, GIANT WAVES. Because no human would have come to that planet and survived those just because he or she tried REALLY hard. 01:52:55 Tom is a dick to Murph’s friend and his own family. 01:53:40 Great, inspiring scientist pioneer turns out to be an evil dickhead cliché. Also, how ironic is the name Mann right now? Mann as man’s biggest enemy. Subtle, Nolan.  01:56:20 God, what a dick this guy is. And what is with this weird death narration monolog?  01:59:14 Was setting the corn field on fire really necessary? I mean, Tom is her brother and he would never hurt her. Why didn’t she just tell him she needed access to her old room again?     02:00:30 Oh..Now I see why  Doyle had to die. They didn’t want to kill the black guy first. That’s racist.    02:07:00 Brand thinks that Mann will listen to her now after ignoring continuous warning from Cooper.    02:09:30 Hans Zimmer isn’t winning an Oscar for the score in this scene.    02:11:25 Holy shit they actually pulled it off. Might as well take off a sin for this one because this scene was fucking awesome.     02:14:50 I don’t know a lot about physics, but if not even light can escape, how are you gonna get data transmissions out?    02:17:00 Movie actually managed to make me feel bad for the robot that looks like a Lego.    02:20:30 Cooper isn’t getting spaghettified in this scene, as one normally would according to what I know about black holes.     02:21:00 What the fuck is going on?    02:22:27 Well that god Murph has this huge bookshelf in her room. Otherwise there wouldn’t have been anything for him to peep through and contact her.    02:22:30 Murph.    02:27:15 At this point, I’m just cleaning parts of my brain off my surroundings because it just exploded.    02:28:20 Thankfully Murph is extremely smart. Imagine if Coop had only had one child.     02:30:20 At least one of these containts Murph having sex with someone. Imagine the awkwardness.    02:31:10 TARS would have been excellent at CinemaSins    02:33:17 Jessica Chastain isn’t my girlfriend in this scene.     02:33:45 More than 2 and a half hours in, movie finally spells out the solution to the continuous pronoun game.     02:35:45 Not only did Cooper fly into a black hole and survive, he also got picked up by a ship after floating in space JUST IN TIME. This is coincidentacular!    02:37:20 Cooper doesn’t seem to give a single fuck about anything this guy is telling him.     02:38:10 The setup of the TVs is really inconvenient. How would you focus on one of them if you can hear all the others at the same time?    02:38:26 They found this strange robot and decided to just let him sit here in this museum? Really?    02:39:40 We interrupt Interstellar to bring you the Citadel Station from Mass Effect. Do they have Mass Relays and hot blue aliens too?    02:40:29 Cooper didn’t close the door behind him. I just hate it when people do that.     02:41:15 This scene ruined my eye makeup when I saw the movie in a theatre.    02:41:55 Are you serious? You waited almost a century for him to come back and send him away after LITERALLY a minute? Also, everyone else in the room completely ignores him, which is kind of rude, really.     02:42:57 Cooper was just able to steal a uniform and a jet? This station must have terrible security protocols. Also, narration.    02:43:56 The USA have now successfully brought democracy to a new galaxy!"
CinemaSins,35tf5v,PiotrElvis,2,Wed May 13 11:45:07 2015 UTC,"Also, the movie explains almost all the phenomenons seen earlier except all the electronics going haywire, with the tractor riding on their own and stopping near the house, the drone flying around and so on. And if it was a gravity thing, why were people not affected?  And the way Doyle died really deserves more than one sin. I just watched this movie and I loved it, but that made me literally curse the stupidity of this character(under my breath though, the movie's still awesome, although somewhat poorly paced)."

Also some really cheap and bad beers outside of USA, of course. You only have to use barley or wheat if you're making beer according to the German Law of Purity(or only barley, if you're following Bavarian Purity Law, you can only make ""white beer"" using wheat). But for everybody, basically every crop can be used to make something Americans would call beer.    P.S. You may think I have a prejudice against American beer, but Mexican is just as bad when it comes to ingredients. It's just a generalisation."

Anyhow, I only heard about making beer from corn and other crops because I checked some facts about the 100 Beer War between Bohemian Budweiser and the American one. I still don't know how they can call a beer from Saint Louis Budweiser, which literally means ""from Budweis"" or, using the Czech name of the town ""from Budvar"". It also couldn't legally be called beer, since it's made from both barley and rice malt."

CinemaSins,35qbv4,Isaac_Chade,6,Tue May 12 19:07:28 2015 UTC,"IIRC it is the Order of the Phoenix that brings up unspoken spells, and it all boils down to unspoken spells being harder to cast, requiring great concentration and ability, as well as not as strong, but far superior for things like surprise attacks and fighting, since not shouting your spell mean your opponent has to guess how to defend himself. This is also why Snape was trying to teach Harry to block Voldemort from his mind, as a wizard who can read your thoughts can tell what spell you cast regardless, giving him an advantage.  So, while the books don't matter, you are right. Spoken spells are stronger and more reliable, but easier to defend against. Therefore unspoken spells are usual used in battle for their quick fire ability and the element of surprise."

I think #3 works the best as a film on its own.

SPOILER I was slightly disappointed by the 2 twists :    The one about Finch's identity was so obvious it doesn't make sense that someone like Bentley didn't figure it out earlier, especially since the fact that absorbers are rare is hit really hard on them (and us).  The one about Donnie is also obvious, the kid that everyone underestimates and has mysterious DNA saves the day, it is a little bit cliché and a big Ex Machina. (Not that I did not appreciate the ending, this was tense and I could not let go of my book). After hearing you talking about ex machina, I didn't expected to see one in this story.

The part you're referring to was where I used a comparison to other YouTubers to gauge CinemaSins' fame, which really isn't all that much. I suppose saying he isn't famous isn't quite accurate, since a good 250k people know who he is at minimum, but he certainly isn't famous in the traditional sense of the word. Also, that probably wasn't the best example, but the point remains.  I could spend two hours on the street in any major city in the U.S. asking everyone who walks by ""Do you know who Jeremy Scott is?"" and get nothing but ""no""s, and that's assuming everyone answered.

While I personally thought it to be one of the, if not the, most enjoyable Marvel Studios films so far in terms of charming dialogue, visual spectacles, and nerdy easter eggs, it had quite a few disappointing missed opportunities (mainly more characterization of the Twins and Ultron) and confusing plot holes (the Selvig/Thor/lake thing), all of which would've been fixed if they hadn't cut an entire hour out of the film, which is why I'm excited to see the extended cut when it hits Blu-Ray."
CinemaSins,34v81i,keysersoze1015,3,Mon May 4 21:54:49 2015 UTC,Apparently that was the studio's decision.

CinemaSins,34v81i,DJPizzaBagel,19,Mon May 4 22:49:25 2015 UTC,"The problem was that ""Veronica"" (the floating platform dispensing parts) was very vulnerable and Ultron would have blown the shit out of it within seconds. The hulk doesn't go after it because he's focused on Stark and doesn't think that much about stuff when he's smashing.  The suit was designed for the hulk and just having a lot of strength without the support sytem isn't useful at all in the final fight unless the plan would have involved Tony fighting Ultron's main body."
CinemaSins,34v81i,LordSwedish,3,Mon May 4 23:25:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, from the hovering thing that popped off a satellite which it is mentioned was designed either by Banner or with Banner.    The Hulk blew it up though didn't he? As they are flying toward the building another part comes in and the hulk grabs and throws it at the floating arm dispenser.   I assume it blew up, Hulk is pretty accurate at that kind of stuff (like in Avengers when he grabbed the fighter jet pilot ejecting)."

In my opinion a villain doesn't need a different motive, than being bad, but Ultron wants to make the world a better place. He doesn't like the current humans, so he wants to make a new and better version. It is also said, that he doesn't think very rational, because he isn't just a programmed AI, but was mainly caused by the mind stone.   I don't think there are really big plotholes, but clearly the movie is too short for its amount of characters and locations."
CinemaSins,34v81i,miningrush,3,Mon May 4 22:33:28 2015 UTC,Awkwardly long titles between segments of the video...
CinemaSins,34v81i,redtail42,3,Mon May 4 23:18:41 2015 UTC,"I disagree with many points you brought up as flaws, mostly because the awnser are in the movie itself.  Ultron is the Pessimist AI that dont see value in life, maybe because his base was with Loki so much time, while Vision, which isnt a evil AI, is the Optimist one that wants to save all forms of life. i though this was explained quite well, but it brings my next point  Also, Ultron isnt supposed to be a big villain, he is the one that sets some things in motion to future films, like Civil War and Infinity War .This is marketing fault i thing, they made everyone believe ultron would be big and made people excited about him, but he really is nothing, and isnt suppose to be.  About Scarlet Witch, remember that they say the ""twins are not ready""?, she doesnt know all her powers but emotions running high amplified her powers, which is a very common trend on this type of films, doesnt mean she can control it fully, and she probably doesnt, Quicksilver probably just died to give depth to Scarlet Witch, because she needs to be mad with the world for some reason to stay on character i guess, or maybe Joss needed to kill someone and he didnt made the cut.  also, Jarvis is not the one directly responsible for everything Iron Man does, he just do it for him, Tonny even jokes about it when he start to send a command and realized he would have to do it by himself instead of rellying on Jarvis to call his armor for him.  Overall i thing those who know about the comics story a little will enjoy this movie more since its a movie supposed to begin directly 3 other movies (Infinity War, Ragnarok and Civil War) and we are way more excited for what it is leading to than what it is."

CinemaSins,34v81i,rajismyname,4,Tue May 5 18:59:05 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, in comics Ultron started as what it was intended, fighting crime. After he keeps fighting on and on, finally he comes to conclusion that for a real peace, Avengers have to be destroyed. This was a very important part of Ultron's story and they completely skipped it in the movie, so Ultron became a dull evil with a shitty motive.   One thing you said is that you still can't tell who is more stronger but I think that's the thing what make this movie good because everyone, even an unnecessary character like Hawkeye feels like he's main character in his scenes and it doesn't become something like ""fuck these other guys I wanna see Iron Man"". X-men definitely has that problem because every single movie is basically ""Wolverine and other mutants"". Wolverine is my favorite X-men character and I love how Hugh Jackman portrays him too but I was glad that First Class didn't have him more than a cameo and It's my favorite X-men movie.   It is inevitable to compare Quicksilvers, X-men vs Avengers. Quicksilver in X-men is awesome character and I loved that scene of him very much but the problem is, that scene made him way too overpowered which makes it very stupid to left him back and I hated that. On the other hand, Avengers Quicksilver is poorly written imo and he's like he can be fast whenever he want and other times he's just a normal guy (in X-men you could understand that his mind was also working too fast). Also Spoiler   And finally, if they were going to give the role of creating Ultron to Iron Man, Why the fuck did they add Ant-man to MCU? He is basically known as the man who created Ultron and they added him to Universe after Ultron. That doesn't make sense to me."
CinemaSins,34v81i,orhansaral,4,Mon May 4 22:32:10 2015 UTC,"To your last point, the Ant-man that is coming to the MCU is NOT the one that made Ultron. Hank Pym is the one who designed it and he is not in the Ant-man movie or in the MCU at all.  IMO this is a good change, as Hank Pym is a wife beating cunt who has all of Tony's assholeness, but without his charm. Imagine pre-capture Tony, but all the time with no character improvement or maturity. While Tony pretends to be a selfish playboy, everything he does in the last few movies has been for the benefit and protection of humanity. Hank Pym is, in fact, and actual asshole.  Everything else you said, I think, is spot on. Fuck Avengers Quicksilver."

He's addressed by a pseudonym, implying that he's been there for a while, cultivating that identity. Then Lois ventures out after the sun goes down and she spots Supes going around without a coat, thus spurring her to follow him.   The thing is... why didn't he wear a freakin' coat? Sure, Superman doesn't need a coat, but Joe Everybody does, and he's been working hard convincing everyone else he's Joe Everybody. He didn't know that tonight was the night he was going to learn all the answers to the questions he'd been asking himself. For all he knows, he's going to have to keep being Joe Everybody tomorrow. What would have happened if someone other than Lois spotted him sans coat? ""Uh, hey, man... Me and a couple of the guys saw you leave your tent without a coat and you didn't get frostbite or hypothermia or deadsies, so... what's up with that?""  If he wanted to protect the identity he cultivated, he could have just worn a coat, but he didn't because the movie needs Lois to follow him for some idiotic reason."

Unit 1 was brought back online in 1985, while the cleanup was still underway, and is still running to this day.

CinemaSins,34m1e3,Rhyfel,3,Sat May 2 10:46:36 2015 UTC,"Media and entertainment is art. Art, in its nature, is subjective. Nothing can be objectively good. When we talk about art, specifically film, being objectively good, we are usually talking about it either being different from its peers in a way we find aesthetically pleasing, or it being familiar to us to the point of causing feelings of nostalgia.   Now, for film, there are camera techniques, storytelling techniques, animation techniques, etc. that have been judged to be useful for portraying certain ideas. A film can use these things incorrectly and make it objectively bad in that sense.  Transformers movies are bad at this, usually. And just because something can't be objectively bad, doesn't give it an excuse to be lazy.  Also, this video is one of my favorites, analyzing Michael Bay's films. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2THVvshvq0Q"

I have so much (more) respect for Jackie and so much more disgust for recent movies. I noticed shit looked fake, now I know why."
CinemaSins,34m1e3,PiotrElvis,2,Sat May 2 17:26:50 2015 UTC,"I do believe that movies and other works of art can be objectively good. But I only say that a movie is bad if I can specifically point out things that make a movie bad, and vice versa. Take The Thin Red Line for example. It's actually pretty complicated, because it has both great and terrible qualities. There are a lot of scenes that have no place in being in a war movie, for example the whole first ten minutes, which feel like an eternity. There is more in that movie, like inconsictency, a lot of useless flashbacks and so on. But at the same time, there are great scenes, where I felt really moved, and I can point out which scenes and why they were great.   There is another problem, which is that different genres aren't judged by the same standards. This is sometimes used as an excuse for people who argue that Transformers etc. are not bad movies, because they're just action movies, but that's not true. An action movie still can be simply good or bad, and the action scenes are not the most important factor. It's the usual-the characters, how relatable they are, the plot, the challenge facing our protagonist, the villain, the dialogue, and so on. I personally believe that Die Hard is the best action movie, primarly because when it comes to action movies, most aren't just action- Terminator, Predator and Matrix are sci-fi, and Matrix is also a large bit kung-fu movie, different Bourne films are spy movies, it's the case in most action movies, and Die Hard is generally considered one of the best action movies ever. Also, I think that no movie can be objectively said to be better than Die Hard, because it's impossible to compare-for example- between this one and The Shawshank Redemption.   Tl;dr-You can say that some movies are objectively good or bad, but only if you can name what are their good or bad qualities, and you can't compare movies, that are the best in their genres."

I really liked how you found a way to blend an incredibly relatable childhood coming of age story, a superhero story, and a story about escaping the box society puts on you and overcoming. Thank you for sharing you story with us!"
CinemaSins,3445md,StudentOfEtherium,2,Wed Apr 29 03:41:51 2015 UTC,"Wow. Thanks for the kind words. I have a few more stories I'd like to tell in this world, if I'm fortunate to be given a chance. Thanks for taking the leap on the book!"
CinemaSins,3445md,StudentOfEtherium,3,Wed Apr 29 03:44:31 2015 UTC,"First of all, this was amazing. However, could we get a companion novel, like The Zombie Survival Guide was to World War Z, for this?  Also, no offence, but this was kinda predicable. I figured out that ""Finch"" was the grandfather around when they mentioned how he got struck one the face, and I figured out Donnie a few chapters after the idea of the all power person was introduced. Was this intentional, or am I just too smart for my own good?"
CinemaSins,3445md,StudentOfEtherium,3,Tue Apr 28 05:11:20 2015 UTC,"It's intentionally predictable to a degree. I have no idea how old you are, but I was trying to make it tough for 12-14 year-olds to predict. If you're in that age range... you're either smarter than average, or smarter than I predicted. :)"
CinemaSins,3445md,StudentOfEtherium,3,Tue Apr 28 05:13:17 2015 UTC,"I'm 16, and the companion novel idea? This is the type of world with so much potential lore, it's practically begging for one."

CinemaSins,3445md,Loman3000,1 point,Tue Apr 28 05:41:02 2015 UTC,"Hell I'm 29 and I didn't guess the Donnie thing until Philip was having his final showdown with Finch. It was as he was repeating the prophecy again that I realized that a kid with Down Syndrome  certainly doesn't ""see"" the world as others do.     Though I did catch the Finch twist rather early. It was when the boys were struggling to find out who he was, Bentley had just explained that there were no other Absorbers in Finch's age bracket. I went ""Well, except Phillips's grandfather."" And kind of pieced it together there. Superheroes never stay dead, after all.     And while I didn't exactly PREDICT the Chad twist, I did muse to myself while walking in to work today, having left the story at the point where the boys had just escaped the police in central park, that it would be interesting if Chad was working with Finch and he had somehow manipulated the situation where the others were arrested (thus screwing with Phillip's potential plans) and that's why he was the only one not taken. Imagine my surprise when I turned out to be half right! I totally just pulled that out of my ass... I then proceeded to drive all the way home with my attention locked on to the story, which by the way is a terribly unsafe thing to do when driving in the rain and I do not recommend it. Not gonna lie, though. I kind of hated you for it, I LIKED Chad... You know, when he stopped being a dick-head.     ...Hey you know an invisible kid could probably get the gun off a confused cop real easy...     Now that I've rambled on for three solid paragraphs, I do have a couple questions, if this thread is even still relevant. The first one is about age... Finch was betrayed 50 years ago, the book says, but that would have to make Phillip's dad at LEAST fifty if not more, with 12 and 11 year old boys? I can understand a late start to family, but it's kind of rare to see a couple in their 40s only start having children.     The second is, well, Phillip's DNA. I understand that it was partially a red herring for the prophecy, but it is established that Phillip's unique DNA means SOMETHING is special about his powers... That never really gets resolved. Is it that they're just incredibly powerful as we see in the finale? Cause I don't really feel that was linked if it was. Bentley had been pushing all the boys to explore and expand their powers, and continued to in the very last chapter even, I just figured Phillip's extraordinary telekinetic abilities was an expansion of the theme of the boy's disabilities forcing them to push their powers in ways others never did, and becoming far stronger for it.      I also let out a bit of a chortle when it was revealed Henry was black, I would LIKE to assume that was intentional, as a way to snap people into confronting their own preconceived notions? (I'll cop to it, I imagined Henry to be white up till then.)"
CinemaSins,3445md,poofenmacher,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:14:31 2015 UTC,"The age thing could just be a mistake/typo on my part. I'm not sure. But I did envision Phillip's father as late 30's early 40's.   The DNA stuff will be addressed in future sequels, assuming I'm lucky enough to keep writing them. I have three or four more stories mapped out.   I was indeed trying to encourage people to at least glance at the issue of preconceived notions, yes. Race isn't really an issue to Phillip, for a very specific reason, which I think is interesting.   Thanks for taking the leap and reading the book!"

CinemaSins,3445md,ZenthonNebula,2,Tue Apr 28 11:47:47 2015 UTC,"I guess I wanted the ultimate hero to be more of a surprise than the villain reveal. I expect many will predict Finch's twists. We'll see. Sounds like you liked it, though. :)"

I was surprised by how well written the book was and pleased to see that some super hero tropes were thrown in tastefully.   As I was reading and getting towards then end, I kept thinking that it would be finished with a second book due to the MASSIVE amount of backstory and character development put into the first three parts of the book but I was happy to see that it was a complete story and I didn't have to wait for the final conclusion like a person that only follows the hobbit trilogy through the movies.  I honestly cannot wait to see what you have in store next, maybe some GoodSprings alternative to what's going on?? Anyway I loved the book and have no complaints except for their not being a lap dance in the book. Thanks again!  EDITS: I can't grammar on mobile"

CinemaSins,3445md,Redditwatter,2,Sun May 3 02:12:38 2015 UTC,"My goal was to be honest to the character but also shock with his violence. It's a fine line, I guess.   We may never know. :)"
CinemaSins,3445md,AgentNeoSpy,2,Sun May 3 02:24:30 2015 UTC,"Favorite book I've read in a while. I just love the concept of the Ables working together to overcome disabilities. I am excited for any possible sequels, either in the same world or following the Ables more, it's still gonna be great. The whole Donnie thing was great, and it took me longer than normal to realize he had all the powers. One minor thing: in a few places, you mention Chad using both of his hands, after he loses his arm. Does he have a prosthetic and I missed a line, or is it a simple error? (In the part where Phillip, Henry and Chad are sneaking into the school, you have Chad putting a hand on each of their shoulders)."

I must admit, I was convinced for most of the book that Patrick was going to be revealed as the ultimate hero...was satisfied in being wrong in that estimation.  Also, really dug the reunion of Mr. Charles and Finch at the end.  Very well written characters, highly entertaining story, and some really good plot twists.  Fingers crossed that this book is a success and we get a sequel."
CinemaSins,3445md,Snote85,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:16:18 2015 UTC,"So I just finished listening to the book, I don't like reading... But I found the book so compelling after the first 1h or so that I just kept it playing all weekend. I guessed the Finch thing, but had no idea on Donnie. I liked the slightly obscure story beats, it had (i felt) a plot where it was hard to guess the mid point, I think having it split into the seasons and the super-sims breaking up the story really worked... hope you have the film rights, as I think it might do quite well if made right! Look forward to the next one!"
CinemaSins,343gw1,nyanni,19,Tue Apr 28 00:25:38 2015 UTC,"I did something awful to myself this weekend. I watched..  Fifty Shades of Grey  (I only watched it once, so this list isn't complete, considering this movie is sinful as fuck. But it's a start.)    (00:00:38) 38 seconds of logos  (00:00:57) At this point, I still have a tiny bit of hope left it will be a surprise Harry Potter movie  (00:00:59) This movie exists. Twilight fanfiction got made into a movie. I really wish this was a joke, but sadly it isn’t.   (00:01:16) Okay, so this walk in closet looks nice, but it’s terribly inconvenient. There are shirts on hangers on the left side, but folded ones on this tiny ass shelf on the right side. Whoever designed this closet should be fired.  (00:01:25) Main character goes jogging in the moring and gets ready for the day montage cliché. Also: Christian Grey is a dick to seagulls.  (00:01:40) This drawer does not contain 50 grey ties.  (00:02:10) Okay, so the ground looks like it’s wet, she’s carrying an umbrella but her car and those next to it look perfectly dry. That is not how rain works.  (00:02:17) Grey House? Really?  (00:02:51) Orgy of evidence that Anastasia is socially awkward and has no fashion sense, just like Bella from Twilight. Also: Her roommate has a cold for about 5 minutes just because Ana needs to do the interview so the movie’s plot can happen. (00:03:13) Ana is the only one driving in Seattle today, apparently. (00:03:16) Ana is not looking at the road, therefore endangering herself and others. (00:03:20) Of course she gets the perfect parking spot right in front of the building. (00:03:30) Staring at a building before entering cliché (00:04:06) On the question sheet for the interview it said that Grey’s main business is the telecommunications sector but this place looks more like a modelling agency. Is anyone who works here not super hot? (00:04:18) Ana trips over a flat surface. You know who else would do that? Bella. From Twilight. Geez, this movie is really beating us over the head with Twilight references and we’re not even 5 minutes in.  (00:04:46) She drove all the way from Portland to Seattle for a 10 minute interview? Couldn’t they have done this over the phone or Skype?  (00:05:15) This has to be one of the most awkward interviews in a movie, ever (00:06:05) Christian Grey says he’s good with people, at reading them. You know who else could read people’s minds? Fucking Edward Cullen. God, this movie has no shame. (00:06:22) Ana is recording this interview, but keeps covering the microphone with her hands.  (00:07:00) Jamie Dornan is seriously hating his role in this scene. (00:08:38) Uh..that wasn’t even 5 minutes. He said he has 10 minutes. I mean, not that I would want to see 10 minutes of this awkwardness, but it’s still a sin.  (00:08:48) Young, successful billionare who is also good looking is interested in awkward, average looking student Ana for no goddamn apparent reason. (00:09:52) How does Ana not notice this? It even made a noise. (00:10:00) Oh, they’re on first name basis already? (00:10:15) Ana walks outside into the rain and stands there like she’s just been through some shit. Sorry Ana, but you do not deserve a shot like this one. (00:10:45) I know there are used tissues on the table next to her, but really, Kate doesn’t look like she’s even remotely unwell.  (00:11:21) Because apparently Kate knows that this extremely unlikely lovestory is about to happen. (00:11:32) What is this, a no name search engine? Fucking hipsters. (00:12:30) Kate changes her mind about being hungry in literally under a minute, steals the sandwich and Ana doesn’t even make herself a new one. (00:13:01) Movie just won’t let you forget you got dragged into this. Or did this to yourself on purpose. Even if you just wanted to sin it. (00:13:13) Discount Jacob from the Twilight series.  Ana also drives an old car…Just like Bella. Damn, is there anything this movie didn’t rip off? (00:14:05) Ana’s mom lives in the south and her new spouse is a professional sportsman..Just like Bella’s mom in..ah, fuck it. (00:14:33) What exactly was his plan? Just stand there and wait until she walks around the corner? Good god this guy is creepy. (00:15:56) Ana might just be even less interesting than Bella. I didn’t think that was possible. (00:16:04) Well, he kind of has the personality for it. Also, this would have been a much better movie if he actually was a serial killer. (00:18:10) Jose? Really? They couldn’t even give him a name that doesn’t start with J?  (00:19:53) They stood up, walked out of the café in silence and she is just now suddenly asking this question so we can hear it. (00:19:57) Movie rips off the almost getting hit by something scene from..you guessed it. (00:20:19) What? You just had coffee and didn’t even finish that. The fuck is wrong with this guy? (00:20:31) No university would let students sit that closely together during a final exam. Hell, at my uni we can only use every other row and every other seat. (00:20:49) Ana says “This is way too much” but when we see her afterwards she looks the same as always. (00:22:33) She still has a flip phone? This movie does take place in 2015 though, right? Also, why is she calling this asshole? He clearly told her to stay away and he acted like a complete weirdo, but I guess the power of drunk female boners is stronger. (00:23:22) Dakota Johnson would have been excellent as Christian Grey.  (00:24:40) This asshole is kind of taking advantage of her being drunk. Not cool man. (00:25:02) How did he find her? Also, she looks surprisingly okay for someone who just threw up. (00:25:34) How did Grey know what Kate looked like, so he could send his brother to dance with her?  (00:26:34) This movie really has no shame, does it? (00:26:45) Ana takes this medication without looking at the pill bottle.  (00:27:28) Haha. Gross. (00:27:54) Everyone who had had a hangover, ever, knows that the last thing you want to do right after waking up is eat. Especially not dry toast. Isn’t this guy a billionaire? Can’t he afford something decent, like, I don't know, french toast? (00:28:14) What. The. Fuck.  (00:28:31) Take away his money, and this line becomes straight up horror movie material. Every normal person would make a run for it at this point, but Ana likes it because she’s a discount Bella. (00:29:40) Who just sits there looking like this, waiting for the other person to go in for the kiss? Gosh this is stupid. (00:31:25) They were fucking on the sofa? Eww. And..he still had his pants on? Did he leave them on all night? Also: Kate is not my girlfriend in this scene.  (00:31:33) Come on, dude. At least wash your hands first. We all know where they've been.  (00:31:52) New lovers are almost always fuckfaces. (00:33:09) I think we might have to do an elevator opening bonus round.  (00:33:54) This line is really creepy, and other than his money, there really isn’t anything appealing about this guy. Well, maybe his looks, but there are literally billions of other guys who are just as attractive but have a normal personality. (00:34:40) Things! Lights! Seattle! (00:35:57) Christian pours more wine into Ana’s glass than into his. Make of that what you will. (00:36:35) HAHAHAHAHAHA. How the fuck did this line get past all the people involved in making this movie? Nobody thought “Eh, this might not translate well?”? Really? Life pro tip: Do not say this to your date. (00:37:10) At this point, I’m not sure if she’s trolling or just really naïve. Has to be trolling, right? (00:39:07) Ana , as a college student, has never even heard of bdsm.  (00:41:47) So, Ana has never had sex but as soon as this billionaire guy comes along and asks about taking her virginity she’s basically up for it right away? What a gold digging whore this woman is. (00:42:00) 42 minutes in and we’re just now barely getting something that resembles an erotic scene (00:45:00) <snore>"
CinemaSins,343gw1,nyanni,13,Tue Apr 28 02:39:36 2015 UTC,"Continued..   (00:46:50) They dragged Rolling Stones music into this, didn’t they? (00:48:26) There is no soap or anything in this water. How would she get clean? That’s not how bathing works. (00:48:40) Her hair looked gross in the previous scene and she didn’t wash it. Ew. (00:50:55) This handshake was awkwardly long. But hey, at least she did wash her hands. (00:51:45) That was the shortest visit to provide exposition ever. (00:52:48) Not really, for a billionaire. You'd think he has models and all kinds of attractive women throwing themselves at him. Which makes it even more surprising why he would go for someone like Ana in the first place.  (00:53:05) He told her he doesn’t do romance. Is she really that dense? (00:54:12) Orgy of Audi product placement. (00:54:30) No Audi R8 driver ever uses the right lane. I’m just saying.  (00:55:10) Child abuse. Also, Expositional dialogue while walking through the woods cliché. What’s next? Will he take of his shirt and reveal that he sparkles in the sunlight? (00:56:45) What is it about Ana that is so special? Someone please tell me because I can’t figure it out for the life of me. What did you say? The plot? Oh. (00:59:12) Reading. (00:59:22) Email writing. (00:59:43) Reading AND narration in one. That’s worth two sins. (01:01:06) The contract says she’s not really allowed to drink and he sends her..wine? (01:01:45) God damnit, is he really still narrating?  (01:02:34) What a creepy motherfucker. I said it before, I’ll say it again, take away his money, and this goes from romance to a horror movie instantly. (01:03:02) Dude, you’re already on top of her. Ask her before you do that next time.  (01:05:33) Why is he still in bed with her? Grey is really inconsistent with his own rules. (01:07:04) <sigh> (01:08:21) This room is way too dark to suggest that any kind of business is being done here.  (01:11:29) Ice skating? This girl tripped over a flat, non-slippery surface earlier. She would kill herself on an ice skating ring.  (01:14:35) How did he recognize her from behind? Everyone is wearing the same outfit, there are more than a few girls with the same haircut and she’s not a loud talker either…Oh well.  (01:17:03) This room is way too small to accommodate all the graduates and the families. (01:19:34) Ana should go see a doctor because with that delayed reaction time, she might have a concussion. (01:22:45) Okay, so I haven’t really thought about this until now but how can two recent college graduates afford such a big place? (01:30:55) Things! Handcuffs! <snore> (01:33:27) They dragged Rita Ora into this? (01:33:55) Remember who also carried his girlfriend on his back? Yeah.. (01:35:07) <sigh> He told you more times than enough that he doesn’t do romance? What’s wrong with you, woman? You really do just want his money don’t you?  (01:36:30) Christian talks to Ana while she’s (half?) asleep, because, let’s face it, that was for you, the audience, and not for her (01:38:00) This is first class? Doesn’t really look like it. What would coach have looked like, then? Wooden seats?    (01:39:33) More text reading    (01:41:30) Ana goes to visit her mother and this motherfucker ruins their quality time together.    (01:43:40) Flying! Music! Is this movie over soon?    (01:49:00) I fell asleep for 5 minutes and didn’t even bother rewinding. Probably didn’t miss anything anyways.    (01:50:36) Gosh, Ana has to be the most learning resistant person in the world.    (01:51:50) Girl, nobody forced you into this. That’s what you get for being a gold digger.    (01:52:12) Roll credits! Well, almost. Actually, that would have made a better movie title. Or “Fifty Shades of This Movie Cures Insomnisa, Because I Actually Fell Asleep”    (01:54:05) I’ve done some research and apparently, this is really not “the worst” he could do. Just saying.    (01:55:34) Okay, so I’m not defending him here, but she demanded this in the first place and didn’t use her safe words. She basically has no right to be mad at him right now. I mean what did she expect when he told her he was gonna whip her with a belt?    (01:56:24) It’s really dark in this room, considering two lamps are on. Also: crying at night, in bed, while looking at the rain cliché    (01:57:10) Well, there’s 2 more books, meaning 3 or possibly more movies. So I wouldn’t count on it.    (01:57:33) No, you love his money. Big difference.    (01:58:36) Weather outside reflects mood of the main characters cliché    (02:00:03) It’s over! Finally!    (02:00:08) Goddamnit.    (02:00:40) Romantic flashback montage cliché.    (02:01:40) Oh dear god, finally.     Lip bite bonus round!    (00:02:36)    (00:05:14)     (00:12:42)     (00:13:01)     (00:29:47)    (00:30:16)     (00:38:37)     (00:41:23)    (00:41:55)     (00:59:38)     (01:13:26)     An elevator bonus round might be worth it as well, but I forgot to write the timestamps down and I really don’t want to sit through this again."
CinemaSins,343gw1,nyanni,8,Tue Apr 28 02:40:08 2015 UTC,Holy crap. Someone outdoes themselves every week in these threads.

CinemaSins,343gw1,Rhyfel,7,Tue Apr 28 03:10:19 2015 UTC,"Kingsman: The Secret Service  Sin 1: Movie thinks it can get away with about 2 minutes of logos by hiding it under an action scene. And you know what, movie is right.  Sin 2: As usual, having a villain bent on having the entire human race literally fight to the death isn't enough of an antagonist on its own, so why not throw in the usual bully/gang of bully's trope?  Sin 3: Showing the protagonist is a good guy despite outward appearances by having him avoid killing an animal cliche.  Sin 4: Movie thinks it can make the church scene ok by having hate group members be the target, and I'm ok with that, and I am NOT ok with that.  Sin 5: The dog test for the Kingsman trials is just stupid. Afterwards Galahad says ""a Kingsman never takes a life unless to save another"", but the trainees would never get that lesson, since they didn't know the bullet was a blank. All you're teaching is ""don't kill innocents unless we tell you to, in which case, DEFINITELY kill innocents""  Proposed Sin Reductions:  -The Church Scene -""Happy"" Meal (or pretty much Colin Firth in general) -Pomp and Circumstance Head Explosions"
CinemaSins,343gw1,Tayl100,3,Tue Apr 28 06:14:31 2015 UTC,"I would like to expand on that a little bit.  00:15 - Marv.  03:10 - Later the little boy uses the Medal to call for them, but are you saying the kid recalls the exact sentence from all those years.  05:55 - Discount James Bond pose.  06:10 - Discount James Bond Type Spy knows every drink by name by tasting it.  06:30 - Discount Kill Bill kills.  07:35 - Not sure if to give a sin for Samuel L Jackson for being a parody of Samuel L Jackson at this point, or for doing it well enough to still be entertaining.  08:55 - That's a cool Glass Tech, but how do you know others are not using it to watch you, while you don't have it on.  09:45 - And how does the Glasses differentiate from hologram meeting, to only display the poster display.  13:15 - This conflict starts off so fast you wonder how these characters live in the same universe.  14:30 - How did that cop know this car was stolen. Or else, why chase Eggsy.  16:30 - Eggsy seems like the character that has been living off a hard life and been pretty obviously causing trouble for a while, so why this of all times decide to call The Secret Service.  17:35 - Eggsy gets out of jail before the cop comes into the jail to let Eggsy go.  17:35 - Harry can teleport, to arrive there that fast, I guess.  19:35 - Fun way for Harry to kick ass but, how and why did they find Eggsy there, just then.  20:20 - Character taunts bad ass character before bad ass character finishes leaving causing bad ass character to come back and kick ass cliche.  21:50 - I like the tech in this movie but seriously, Bullet Proof ? Bit of a stretch.  22:00 Amnesia Watch.  22:15 - Seems fair to take a sin off for every time Harry kicks ass.  23:30 - Fox.  23:45 - Brutality.  24:30 - Tiny bug also works as a mic with clearperfect clarity.  25:25 - Roll Credits. Kinda.  16:55 - Roll Credits.  27:38 - Exposition through elevator ride that takes just as long as the exposition needs it to take.  28:14 - ""Deep Enough"" Exactly.  29:14 - Discount Warehouse 13.  30:37 - Not quite sure all that could fit into one body bag, but nice speech.  31:00 - ""Bully Group"" cliche.  31:43 - The only reason that girl was introduced was to add tension when the girl ""dies"" on the water test. (I think it's the same girl).  35:25 - I appreciate the brute force solution. But I guess Eggsy is Superman for destroying a two way glass underwater with it's fists.  37:11 - Secret Service Brutality.  37:27 - That was awesome, but, was that Purple?.  39:11 - Eggsy doesn't know what a Pug is.  39:35 - Don't you mean, ""Million Dollar English Pounds"" question? Or, quids.  46:06 - If the announcement was today, meaning earlier. How can you on-demand start a recording of it.  46:56 - ""Zoom and Enhance"" cliche.  49:40 - This is the biggest issue I have with this movie, all these tests are baffling obvious and easily avoidable. The first thing I thought when hearing ""One of you don't have a parachute"" was, what if you are lying. Could .  55:55 - I actually appreciate this conversation a lot.  56:59 - Nanotracker Gel. Also Super Spy doesn't expect some kind of tracker, even if a Gel on a drink.  60:58 - Discount Rorschach.  61:00 - Again, once again pretty obviously a test the second the question started, removing all tension from the scene.  64:25 - ""Deep Pain Pizzas"".  64:18 - ""Shaken, not Stirred"" ?.  67:00 - Comedy.  68:15 - ""What a Coincidence"".  68:21 - Oh.  67:19 - That's racist.  70:50 - Once again, obviously a test. Why wouldn't Eggsy test the bullets first, to see if it was loaded and or with blanks. Aside from that, why would you fail the test by not killing an innocent for no reason.  72:39 - Girl Lancelot. Sin removal for that alone cause it's awesome? :).  77:50 - Remove sins for this amazing line. Hail Satan.  78:35 - I suggest removing a sin for every few seconds of this shit. And another for Free Bird.  81:14 - The way the song fades out when Harry gets stunned by the grenade blast is a neat effect but makes it seem like when Harry goes badass crazy, that's what plays inside Harry's head.  38:30 - Love this sincere meta sequence and Harry's death should be awarded something for actually being a surprise. But later Valentine actually does stall giving the good guys enough time to save the day, so this is that kind of movie.  86:35 - You think that everyone would have been checked for that scar after finding out it's existence.  87:16 - Also, so did Arthur knew Eggsy was coming, to poison the drink.  93:05 - ""Character that has issues with height has to perform some height stunt"" cliche.  96:07 - Balloon Balls.  87:10 - Something about this Arctic Military Bad Guy Base thing it's both a Discount James Bond but also a very cool nod to James Bond. So, nothing to add here, just a cool reference.  100:28 - Balloons explode cause they heard the countdown to add more tension.  101:50 - Stop this James Bond movie to bring you Matrix, and bullet dodging.  102:30 - Even with a Tech Space Suit, spinning that fast would render you unconscious within seconds.  103:21 - So why is it that one satellite causes the whole thing to not work. Couldn't you start human genocide on the rest of the planet then just finish up later.  106:05 - The soldier dudes didn't seem to know the airplane was part of Eggsy's team here. But later some soldiers dudes go along to the plane as if they always knew, somehow.  107:28 - Here.  107:49 0- So the military was guns blazing a second ago, but they stop to give the good guys enough time to escape.  108:56 - Just know people, regardless of your race or gender, everyone is firework-confetti-colored on the inside, and that's what counts.  110:50 - Judging by the awesome Church sequence, the whole time the phone thingy is on should be more than enough time to cause the planet to be too far gone to recover.  Also another thing, Harry survived it. Which means this plan would eventually fail since some kind of military would have survived it, and tho the planet would have been wiped by the most part, they sure would have opposed a threat to Valentine.  117 - Well glad that one baby is alive. Don't mention the likely billions of people dead on the few minutes the phone was running tho.  118:55 - What about all the other prisoners.  119: - Anal Ending."

Weak shit, bro.  4) (when Dredd confronts the first rogue judge) While this is a cool fight scene, why didn't Dredd just shoot him?  5) (when Anderson shoots the last rogue judge) ""Villain monologues to the main protagonist long enough for the secondary protagonist to kill him"" cliche.  6) (when Ma-Ma shoots up the whole block with a mini-gun) Dredd and Anderson somehow survive this."

CinemaSins,33zfr0,irishmickguard,7,Mon Apr 27 03:29:43 2015 UTC,A lot of those films lower down the list would be much higher if judged with the same standard used recently. They used to only sin for plot holes and in accuracies. Now they'll sin for something as simple as the mere presence of an actor or brand or whatever. They're a lot harsher these days. Not that thats a bad thing though.

CinemaSins,33lykr,jokinghazard,13,Thu Apr 23 19:03:35 2015 UTC,It seems like every movie that shows a newspaper close-up has the same problem. If you aren't going to spend the 10 minutes to type out a fake article that matches the headline why bother even showing it?
CinemaSins,33lykr,Nomad45,21,Thu Apr 23 18:31:18 2015 UTC,A lot of this happened in the era before HD and the home video scene was VHS... and I just don't think anyone back then thought the actual newspaper articles would be visible or scrutinized. We've noticed a lot of modern films get it right.
CinemaSins,33lykr,trevdordurden,2,Thu Apr 23 18:32:54 2015 UTC,Do you have any examples of where one got it right?

CinemaSins,33lykr,Jimm607,1 point,Fri Apr 24 06:22:17 2015 UTC,I'm sure there's a lot of set dec that only a couple notice yet they do anyway. It's probably like Jeremy said that in the VHS days you couldn't read it so its not worth putting time into.
CinemaSins,33lykr,Josealejandro88,2,Fri Apr 24 13:47:23 2015 UTC,"my point is that its still not worth putting the time in. Nobody is going to pick up on it in the cinema, and you're only do it for a miniscule fraction that will actually check, and for what? its not going to improve the movie in any respects to anyone, most people who dig through this stuff probably get more enjoyment out of finding the mismatched articles than they would if someone had thrown together a relevant one."
